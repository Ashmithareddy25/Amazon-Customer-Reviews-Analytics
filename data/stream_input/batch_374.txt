B000002NJS|5.0|In 1998, Madonna released her long-awaited eleventh album entitled, RAY OF LIGHT. I, as a diehard Madonna fan, waited a long time for this album, and I will tell you that it was definitely worth the wait. This album is amazing, and it shows us a new Madonna, a Madonna that we've never seen before: A late '90s spirtual Madonna, with the sound of spiritual dance & techno. Madonna has worked with many great producers in the past, but for this album, she wanted the spiritual sound of the '90s, she recruited William Orbit to produce this album. I heard that Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmunds was to produce this album, but Madonna did not want this album to sound like the BEDTIME STORIES album, for Babyface produced that album, and she wanted something different. This is an amazing album. Want the info? Read on. <br /> <br />DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE <br />  The third single from the album. This song is about how Madonna changed and matured since the birth of her daughter, Lourdes. She kind of felt, at the time, that performing and being the public was her substitute for her real love. This is a great song. <br /> <br />SWIM <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />RAY OF LIGHT <br />  The second single from the album. The album's infamous title track. This song's video had gotten Madonna the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Video. Great song. After five years of not performing this song since her DROWNED WORLD TOUR, Madonna added it to her setlist for her CONFESSIONS TOUR. <br /> <br />CANDY PERFUME GIRL <br />  This song is just absolutely brilliant for it not only features the late '90s spiritual techno sound, but the late '90s spirtual techno sound is fused with Hard Rock sound. A great song. <br /> <br />SKIN <br />  This song is very strange, but it's a great song. <br /> <br />NOTHING REALLY MATTERS <br />  The fifth & final single from the album. This is a great song that talks about how when Madonna was growing up, nothing really mattered to her. Now that she is a grown woman, who is a mother, she sees things differently, and how things have changed in her life. This is a great song, with an extremely creative music video, featuring Madonna, for the first time, in the geisha look. <br /> <br />SKY FITS HEAVEN <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />SHANTI/ASHTANGI <br />  This one is very strange, for it is in some sort of Yoga language. By the early stages of the album sessions for this album, Madonna started taking up Yoga, and this song is in the Yoga language. Very strange song. <br /> <br />FROZEN <br />  The first single from the album. When I saw the music video to this, I had no idea who it was, or what the name of the song was. All I know is when I saw Madonna dressed up in that all-black outfit, with her hands covered in henna tattoos, I thought to myself, \\"Who is this?\\" When I finally found out that it was Madonna, my jaw dropped to my knees. I couldn't believe how amazing Madonna looked and how she completely reinvented herself, yet, again. This is a great song, and will always be one of my favorite Madonna songs. <br /> <br />THE POWER OF GOOD-BYE <br />  The fourth single from the album. This is a great ballad. <br /> <br />TO HAVE AND NOT TO HOLD <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />LITTLE STAR <br />  This beautiful song is actually about her daughter, Lourdes. A great song for her daughter. I cannot get over at how much Madonna and Lourdes look alike. You can definitely tell that Lourdes looks just like her mother. That's a good thing, because it means that Lourdes is a beautiful little girl, being that Madonna was always very beautiful. <br /> <br />MER GIRL <br />  A creep-a** song, that I still haven't figured out who it is about. <br /> <br />    This album is very amazing, and it is one of my favorite albums. This album is for all Madonna fans, and I know the rest of you Madonna fans have this album your collection. Great album.
B00006EXL5|5.0|This cd is great. Every song on this cd is good. The standout tracks to me are &quot;Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot; and &quot;This Is The Best Day Ever&quot;. The last 3 tracks are really good. There was a time when I listened to &quot;Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot; for 4 days straight. It was crazy, just like this cd. Go buy it if you haven't already.
0385512104|5.0|This one of those treasures of a book you come across from time to time. Its rise to the fame reminds me of those exquisite low-budget movies that suddenly appear on the scene and capture audiences around the world. Mark Haddon, an award-winning children's book author, originally wrote the Curious Incident primarily for young audiences, not the general adult reader. Yet, the story and the character are anything but simplistic. Not surprisingly, given its captivating story, its moving main character, and unique style, it won literary awards for youth and children's books. Then, something curious happened as it caught the attention and imagination of the grown-ups... Having just won the Whitbread Prize for the best novel in 2003, it has achieved a rare recognition by winning awards across different literary categories.<br />The story is written from the perspective of Christopher, a 15-year-old youth with ambitions of becoming an astronaut.  It is about experiences in his life, his \\"Special Needs\\" as an autistic youth and his surroundings. At some level he comes across like a younger child that can only react physically to uncomfortable situations, at another he acts like a very mature teenager who can explain his difficulties and reactions. He applies logic and analysis to help him understand real life problems as intellectual puzzles, such as who murdered the poodle. Given a certain rigidity of his systematic thought processes, he cannot give up on a path once chosen, whether intellectually or physically. The resulting problems have to be faced, whatever.  If his parents could have read his book, they would have had a much easier time coping with him.<br />For me Haddon's book is a gem for a number of reasons. It is very real and touching story of a very special teenager that pulls the reader right into it and along with it.  Christopher's ability to observe his surroundings and himself and describe his thought processes in \\"his\\" book allows the reader insights into a personality that we know little about. Haddon describes this environment where autism makes life complicated for Christopher and difficult for his parents with great care, yet he does not allow the special situation to become overbearing. He also demonstrates that people suffering from autism have a lot to offer and their special needs may not as far removed from those of the average normal person.  It is a question of degree.

B00005JKNC|5.0|I was captivated by this movie.  It was good to see Jim Carrey in a non-comedic role.  He does a really good job of this character.  It was a good reminder of the values upon which the USA was founded and that we need to be working to protect those rights.  I would recommend it!
B00009ATIX|5.0|I know that many people hate this movie, but for me it's one of the greatest trips I've ever been on. It haunted me for weeks, no, months. It's really a piece of art. I loved every second of this movie.
0375432302|2.0|The Da Vinci Code proves a very good point: What's popular is not necessarily what is great, good, or even average.<br />You can temper your expectations about this book by telling yourself, &quot;This is a page-turner I can read in one sitting, with about the same level of enjoyment you get out of a twenty-five cent gumball&quot;. Its chief strength is that it has flow, and that the author has done a modicum of historical research, and made a semi-decent stab at weaving together artistic and religious history, spicing it here and there with a few real-life organizations to make it interesting.<br />Beyond that, however, the book has little to offer anything but the most casual reader. The characters are all drawn with the depth of a sidewalk puddle, and the plot is as implausible as it is predictable. If you know anything at all about &quot;conspiracy theory history&quot;, the book will seem trite, and if you don't, you should read a book with more bite, like Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum.<br />Sadly, even the riddles, anagrams, and puzzles in the book are uninteresting, unchallenging, or unoriginal. I suppose if you've never done any sort of puzzle, they might be refreshing and shockingly new. If you haven't, well, maybe you're in for a treat.<br />So, in summary, I wouldn't buy this book if you were an intellectual unless you were trapped in some airport lobby somewhere. I wouldn't buy this book if you were a very dull person until you had run out of Tom Clancy. If someone describes the book as &quot;shocking&quot;, &quot;insightful&quot;, or &quot;provocative&quot;, they're probably related to the publisher.
0425173755|5.0|Inspector Poirot is at first confused by the murder which occurs while he is on the Orient Express.  The man who is murdered is traveling under a false identity as Mr. Ratchett, while he is actually the man who murdered a baby in a notorious case in America.  While Poirot questions each person, he begins to form an opinion as to the solution to the murders.  His friend M. Bouc becomes increasingly confused as he hears the passengers' testimonies, and some stories seem to contradict others.  He changes his mind several times as to who he thinks is the murderer while Poirot remains ever confident that he has the solution.  This is one of Christie's best-known works and it was made into a movie many years ago.  It is recommended reading!

B000065VA1|5.0|This album still haunts me even after nearly 18 years after first buying it on record waaay back in 1986. <br /> &quot;So&quot; is easily my favorite album of his and it's clear why. This is his most sophisticated and most mature work of his and is almost like seeing a light after the darkness explored on the two previous albums &quot;Security&quot; and &quot;Peter Gabriel 3&quot;. The music is a lot more accessible and much more digestable. <br /> &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; is a classic that is very suggestive in it's nature but most will not notice it's devious nature. Still, it's a really funny song with a great video to go with it. <br /> My favorite is &quot;Red Rain&quot;. Man, this song is just amazing! I love the intense and passionate melody and the stormy feel to it. <br /> &quot;In YOur Eyes&quot; is pure bliss. <br /> The rest of this album is no less amazing and the remastering is just incredible. The songs that were great already sound even clearer and sharper in the remasters. The only thing I despise is putting &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; in the end. This is one of his greatest songs but why reshuffle the tracks? <br /> That's the only flaw this album has. <br /> Still, the remastered edition is worth getting but don't go for the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; digipak edition though.
B00007LL7O|3.0|I'll start off by saying that I really try to like Stratovarius. And as i hear more of their stuff, it just turns me off more and more. Timo Tolkki writes repetitive, and blatantly formulaic songs. Timo Kotipelto could possibly be the worst metal singer ive heard in my life, he sounds like a cross between Bruce Dickinson, a B minus 80's glam singer, and a whining 5 year old. Not only that, but he repeatedly sings out his vocal range, causing him not only to shriek, but to sing out of tune as well. What enables me to somehow listen to this band on occasion is the excellent drumming of Jorg Michael, and the fablous keyboards of Jens Johansson. The bass player is not even worth mentioning. Rarely does he play any kind of role in the songs.<br />Now, on to the actual album. Overall, for a Stratovarius release, Elements part 1 could have been fantastic, but its not. Its a notch above average, and ill go from song to song and explain why.<br />1-Eagleheart(5/5): Excellent song, the best song on the album. Kotipelto sings in tune(and sounds good might i add), keyboards are great, everything is good.<BR>2-Soul of a Vagabond(2/5): pretty bad. the melodies are ok, and kotipelto once again actually sings decent here, but Tolkki keeps repeating the same riff over and over, for nearly the entire song. there is nothing about the song that even comes close to grabbing my attention. it makes me want to go to sleep. the song is drawn out, and sounds like a filler. A waste of time.<BR>3-Find Your Own Voice(2/5): could have been an amazing song. there is only one reason why this song is not 5/5. Timo Kotipelto. He ruins it. Throughout the entire song he shrieks and sings flat. I find myself just barely able to listen to this one.<BR>4- Fantasia(1/5): Filler track #2. Just as boring as Soul of a Vagabond, but its also cheesy and fruity to boot. Nothing caught me about this song. The intro is drawn out to the extreme, the lyrical content is awful, and the melodies are simply terrible.<br />5-Learning To Fly(4/5): A good song. They fly through this one, with good melodies, notably excellent keyboard parts, and decent singing by kotipelto, that is up until the end of the song. Would have been a 5/5, but they take it up a half step at the end of the song(a half step too high for kotipelto to sing), and it sounds terrible. If i ever listen to this song, i stop it right as it comes to that part. Otherwise its good.<BR>6-Papilon(3/5): Not bad. Rarely does Tolkki write any good slower cuts, but this ones decent. Kotipelto sings ok here, and its not as cheesy it could have been. <BR>7-Stratofortress(2/5): As much as they attempt to impress me here, they really dont. It sounds almost exactly like Holy Light, which also isnt that great. More filler, really.<BR>8-Elements(-100/5): Could possibly be the cheesiest, most pathetic &quot;song&quot; ive ever heard. I honestly must say id rather hear them do a cover of &quot;The Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;.....its that bad. Im not going to even go in detail about this one....<BR>9-A Drop in The Ocean(4/5): Another surprisingly decent slow song from Tolkki. Kotipelto sounds good, and the melody is actually very nice. Everything seems well put together here, and it leads into Elements Part 2 quite nicely(with the whole ocean sample thingy).<br />Overall, Elements Part 1 isnt terrible, nor is it good. Eagleheart is the only song i truly enjoy from this album. The rest of the songs are either ok, or garbage. Visions is Stratovarius' best album, so get that if you want to listen to most of their best stuff. <br />The one thing i like about this album is the slightly more creative approach they tried to take. they added a symphony orchestra, and they were more adventurous with the overall feel of the album. they had the right idea, but they did not execute it very well at all.<br />If your interested in this genre, i would stay away from Stratovarius though. Sonata Arctica has yet to write a bad song in my opinion, and iwould recommend anything theyve done(their singer is quite exceptional, i would add). if your looking for something more dramatic, Nightwish is an excellent band. I would also recommend Symphony X, but only the album &quot;V: The New Mythology Suite.&quot;
B00008EYA5|3.0|I just got done renting this DVD and must say that it kept me entertained for the length of the film.  So I thought I would come here and write a review, and was kind of puzzled at all of the negative feedback here.<br />When you rent this, are you thinking you will see an Academy Award hopeful?  Is it chock full of Golden Globe performances?  Do you really demand full character development in a shoot-em up movie?  If you do, then simply don't rent this DVD.<br />If you are thinking this movie will blow you away, it won't.  But it is good enough to spend the money on a rental.  Don't believe the harsh reviews on it though.  Those people are just expecting WAY too much from a simple action film.<br />That's the best way to describe the film:  simple.<br />Although, the reviewer that comments about all of the gangs magically coming together to take on the police force for the money is spot on.  That was way too stupid, even for this flick.<br />Other than that, rent the show, turn down the lights, pop the popcorn and enjoy a decent cop movie.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is sooooooooooo great! It's funny and has a good plot at the same time. Please buy this and don't listen to the one star reviewers. This is a classic!
B0000CDLA7|2.0|It's an ok album. I wasn't expecting much from it to begin with, and aside from Stream of Consciousness and In The Name of God, I don't really hear anything interesting on here. The band just sounds like they ran out of ideas and took a bunch of them from the Metallica/Megadeth playbook. I don't mind constant change and progression, even occasional tributes to influences (but not as blatant as the &quot;Blackened&quot; vocal section in &quot;This Dying Soul&quot;). But this... just doesn't do it for me. &quot;Going metal&quot; does not equal tuning down, playing uninteresting, unmelodic solos and trying to sound like a tough guy. It's like they're not even trying anymore.

0812548094|4.0|After reading Wizard's First Rule, I found myself wondering more about Richard and Kahlan.  The first book went far beyond my expectations, and I was enormously happy with the finished product. Stone of Tears, if anything, has surpassed the first novel in quality.  This monster book, around 1000 pages, is full of all the things I have come to expect from Goodkind.  Strong settings, wonderful characters, and an inventive plot keep the book moving at a blistering speed.  Many people feel that most modern fantasy is derivative, and that is true to some extent.  However, Goodkind has established a wonderful world, a unique slant on how magic works, and some of the best characters to ever grace the page.<br />Stone of Tears takes off with breakneck speed and takes the reader to so many amazing locations that the book almost comes off like a George Lucas visual extravaganza.  I would simply love to see some of the amazing pictures Goodkind has created in my mind on the silver screen.  Yet, the book is so large and the plot so twisting and turning that it would lend itself adapted to a cable TV series better than a movie.  There were times I would look up from my reading only to literally hear the sounds stop and the landscape change.  I was in Goodkind's world and he worked his special brand of magic on me as I read.  These books are not literary giants.  Admittedly they would fall under the \\"pulp\\" category, but they are of such a wonderful quality that I feel almost guilty calling them \\"pulp.\\"  They transcend it.  They are so entertaining that many well read people might regard them as \\"guilty pleasures.\\"  Stone of Tears is truly a pleasure to read.  There are so many situations in the book that could be pointed out, but to take time to do so would make this review far longer than it should be.  Suffice it to say that Stone of Tears is one of those rare novels that draw the reader in completely.  From the dark beasts of the underworld to the war against the Imperial Order, this novel jolts out off the page with unstoppable energy.  I honestly think I could have read it in one sitting if my own constitution had been up to the task.<br />I recommend this novel with complete confidence.  I am certain that most readers will want to plunge into the entire series as I am doing now.  I am very glad that I did not find this series until it had been out for a while or there would have been a painful wait for each book.  Goodkind is up to eight novels, one short story, and more books to come.  I am certain that the coming months will find me reading way into the dark night following a hero that I understand and identify with:  Richard, a man with amazing wisdom and goodness that finds himself forced to do things for the greater good.  His character speaks to all of us.  As we read, we discover something about ourselves and the fears we all have.  In doing so, we discover more of our humanity.  These works may be seen as \\"pulp\\" in origin, but they are a powerful read.  Sometimes this novel is dark and brutal, sometimes it depicts things we rather wouldn't see, but sometimes it lifts us up into a wonderful place.  A place filled with the one thing we all need...hope.l Order, this novel jolts out off the page with unstoppable energy.

B000089CJI|5.0|From the iTunes Music Store where else??? The Postal Service's freshman album &quot;Give Up&quot; is nothing short of a musical tour de force. Really...it's that good. So good...it's almost criminal. Take the lyrical honesty of Death Cab and marry it with Jimmy Tamnorello's &quot;Nintendo-esque&quot; keyboard sensibilities. The result is an absolutely smashing record that harkens back to the days of Depeche Mode and Yaz but with a more modern bent. <br />Tracks worth mentioning include:<br />1. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight - In my humble opinion this is the best song on the album. Starts off slow in almost a dream-like fashion then steadily increases, it's tempo culminating in a climax awash in keyboards and catchy drumbeats. <br />2. Such Great Heights - The most &quot;mainstream&quot; song here...thus the most accessible. Great melodies and lyrics abound in this track. Still not as good Dntel's: &quot;This is the Dream of Evan and Chan&quot; but pretty damn close. <br />3. Sleepin in - Questionable lyrics mar this track - including cheesy references to J.F.K. But a catchy chorus help redeem this one from mediocrity to pretty good. <br />4. Nothing Better - One of my favorite numbers on this disc. Jenny Lewis and Ben Gibbard take turns in this one...an example of lyrical sparring at its very best. <br />9. Brand New Colony - Finally....The Super Mario theme song with added vocals!!! I never knew Mario could sing! All kidding aside...this song has some of the best lyrics on this album that compliment the &quot;Mario&quot; sound in perfect fashion.<br />After listening to this album on my ipod too many times to count, I have not grown tired of it yet. On the contrary...it seems to get better with every listen. In fact I am listening to it right now as I type.<br />Trust me...just buy this thing. There is &quot;nothing better.&quot;
0446530891|2.0|Ouch, I've always enjoyed Baldacci but this book has some of the most stilted dialogue I've ever read.  The book starts out great then  coasts into a haze that it never recovers from.  I re-read some of the dialogue about halfway through the book and couldn't believe what I was reading - like bad high school creative writing.   This is only one half of what could've been a really good book. I'll give Baldacci another chance if he'll write a complete book.

B00002MZ2T|4.0|this album kept true to it's predecessor, savage garden didn't sell out...how can they, their the only one of their kind, anything they do would be original. this album is more melodic, sometimes it got annoying because it was too melodic. but nonetheless, they bring the same atmospheric relaxing ballad-y music as before. nothing short of a picasso painting, or a mona lisa artwork. this album is not for the weak of heart, because the beauty displayed by these guys are...beautiful? i'm dumbfounded by this album, speechless. although this time it's not as lovey dubby as last time in terms of true love songs. it's general artistic expressions of the self and of life. they seem to find beauty in just about any damn thing. i love this album. this album should be listened with savage gardens self titled album. just pop those two cds in and have them on random repeat play, and drive away. after a stressful day of work or school, play this and cruise. after a terrible heartbreak, play this and cruise. after a heated arguement with your significant other, play this and make up. this album heals all, trust me.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Through some inside sources I have heard the ENTIRE new Kanye West CD due February 2nd and all I can say is it's freaking awesome and guaranteed you will be hearing Kanye West throughout 2004 and on. He is the new rap sensation.
B000084T18|4.0|...until the next album comes...pun intended. this album is pretty much hype and definitive of what commercialism can do to a good artist. 50 is great no doubt, he's a &quot;bitniz&quot; man and all that, but i mean, he lost 5 percent of his fans,. he seems to car more about money than true music. what i can say is that you will love this album if you're one of those party rappers. this album is pretty uptempo, you can play this while ridin' down to club space or whateva. this album is not for you to sit down and think to, there really requires no thinking to this album it's pretty blah. the beats are hot and hyped though, and 50 created one of the largest buzzes of rap history. he has a couple of deep thought tracks...that heaven song, &quot;many men&quot;, and &quot;don't push me.&quot; he is capable of more than &quot;taking 9 like me.&quot; 50 needs to stop being commercial though, he needs to take it back to power of the dollar. but in all fairness of being a critic, this album is UNAVOIDABLE!
B000003BQW|5.0|After the amount of albums the Ramones released, some of the later albums are obviously going to sound a little recycled.  This is a really good, and under-rated album though.  It's defifitely better then some albums that preceded it.  'Touring' and 'Poison Heart' are 2 of my favourite Ramones songs.  This whole album is very strong though.

B000002N2N|5.0|If you are looking for a Ramones &quot;collection&quot; or &quot;best of&quot; then you should pick this up.  I personally think the live versions of the songs on this CD are better then a lot of the studio version.  Without a doubt it is the best live albums I have heard by them (including a lot of unofficial ones).  I am a fan of every era of Ramones music, but I think this is them at their peak.
B00005JMF6|4.0|This intense chilling flick makes you think, can you really be crazy? It's a heart thumping, jump out of your set thriller. Halle gives a great prerformance,and Robert Downey Jr. not a bad comeback movie for him.Worth staying up for, you might be scared to.
B00003CXC6|5.0|A man is dead, a woman was raped, and that's all that can be definitely said. Somebody has committed murder, but nobody knows whodunnit. Genius filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon\\" is a classic for its skillful direction, suspense and wonderful acting. It's one of those movies you think must be vastly overrated until you see it, and are blown away by it.<br />At the Rashomon Gate in eleventh-century Japan, a man (Kichijiro Ueda) takes shelter with a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) during a rainstorm. The woodcutter is depressed and the priest is horrified, over a recent crime: the vicious bandit Tajômaru (Toshirô Mifune) was arrested for murdering a man named Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) and raping his wife Masako (Machiko Kyô). But when taken before the police, Tajômaru claims that he has his fun with the woman and killed her husband honorably in a fight.<br /><br />But Masako begs to differ; she claims to be the victim first of the sadistic bandit, then of her cold-hearted husband. And when a medium calls up the spirit of Takehiro, he claims that Masako was unfaithful, asking the bandit to murder him, then spurned by Tajômaru. Her actions drove Takehiro to suicide. And the woodcutter himself claims to have seen the altercation -- and his version is wildly different from them all.<br /><br />During the filming of \\"Rashomon,\\" director Akira Kurosawa stated that the film is a reflection of life, which doesn't always have clear meanings. The same could be said of truth. Questions are raised by the events of \\"Rashomon,\\" but given no easy answers -- sometimes no answers at all (my biggest question was how Masako's gown stays so white if she's always weeping on the ground).<br /><br />Light and shadow whirl and dance in a frankly beautiful woodland setting, serving as a pretty backdrop for some very ugly acts. The fight scenes are masterful -- they look like real fights, as opposed to choreography. Tajômaru's are more stylized, whereas the woodcutter sees two guys rolling and staggering around with swords, obviously freaked out. Kurosawa was even brave enough to touch on the unique idea of having the deceased testify. The spinechilling seance scene, starring a downright spooky, stark-faced Fumiko Honma, is a haunting classic scene.<br /><br />Are Kurosawa's insights dark and depressing? In a fascinating, hypnotic way... yes. But while calmly pointing out the ability of human beings to lie even to themselves, he acknowledges that there's good in there too (a scene where the woodcutter adopts an abandoned baby as the priest watches). We lose our illusions and innocence as the priest loses his, forced to look on how despicable people can be, but while being comforted with the knowledge that people aren't all bad, and that unadulterated truth isn't really necessary to have good in you.<br /><br />Toshirô Mifune chews the scenery with gusto as the barbarian bandit, laughing and jerking like a hyena just to see people jump. At first glance, Machiko Kyô seems to be overacting, until you see how unhinged her character has become by whatever happened. Masayuki Mori doesn't get to act as much as the others (the poor guy spends most of his time tied to a tree), but is good when the camera zooms in on him. Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura add an extra dimension as the innocent young priest and the tormented woodcutter.<br /><br />Gloomy, thought-provoking and ultimately quite freaky, \\"Rashomon\\" still defies conventional filmmaking and will suck you right in. It's brilliantly crafted and exceptionally directed, and must be seen by all lovers of cinema. And that's the truth!ng and staggering around with swords, obviously freaked out.

B000050FEN|5.0|This Movie is in the top Ten. I really enjoyed it. It kept you waiting to see what was going to happen next.You have Morgan Freeman,Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and of course Kevin Spacey one of the best cast to be put together.Great job.<BR>   It's was a dark,chilling thriller filled with suspense. A great plot! Gives you the ending of what happens in the last half hour, but no one catch's on until the end,I didn't and i love it , A must see. You won't fall asleep in this one , but sweet dreams.
B00003CX8J|2.0|Read the comic book series and pass this tepid release from 20th Century Fox.  This, along with &quot;Spiderman&quot; (2002), are fine examples of why big-budget Hollywood should step aside and let the comics speak for themselves.
6304708521|3.0|The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour is an unusual oddity: it has a storyline, but it is almost impossible to follow.  And though it contains dreamy colors, they are often pointless.  At the same time, the musical sequences, specifically &quot;The Fool On The Hill&quot; and &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; are brilliant, even if they have no bearing on the story.  Rent it, but be prepared to use your fast-forward button.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I definitely like this CD better than SIAM. It's a sure upgrade. But TDOAK is more subtle than SIAM. I agree with the poster that said the interludes should have been full songs. Yes, they're that good. But that's why I'm impressed. Alicia could probably turn anything into a song and make it sound amazing.<br />Instead of letting her talent get the best of her, she shows her maturity by putting forth a more disciplined record. 12 full songs, 2 interludes, and 1 intro was probably the right choice. Too many songs and the CD just goes on forever, even if they're good. <br />This CD is a real investment in her talent as a recording artist. I can't wait for the third one.
B000067CPX|5.0|By The Way is a beautifully solid, mature album that has a vibe so good it nearly brings me to tears.  What comes through loud and clear is that here are four guys who have been through hell together and are now so f***ing overjoyed to be alive that they've bonded into an inseparable unit.  Just look at the black and white photographs of the band inside the CD and you'll see it in all of their faces.  If you're looking for the funny/arrogant punk/funk boys they used to be you probably won't like this record...<br />The heavy funk-rock songs on the album are more solid than ever, honed by years of experience.  However, the surprise is the number, variety, and quality of softer songs on the record.  This is a Beatles record.  They obviously went into the studio with producer Rick Rubin to make a full, lush record that tapped the vibes of many of the great records of the rock era - and I think they succeeded.  The three most striking elements of the album are the strong vocal harmonies (especially from Flea), John Frusciante's endlessly fresh guitar work, and very strong keyboards.  <br />Look - the Chili Peppers have made a quantum leap with this record.  You may not like the direction, but you cannot deny that these are four guys so deeply in love with each other that they are now nearly invincible.  They have achieved that sort of total bonding where it's just about the music now, and all that other rock star crap is behind them.  Yep, there're all kinds of songs on this album - that's `cuz they've graduated to Musicians.  Open your mind - think about how these songs make you FEEL - not whether they sound like \\"Red Hot Chili Peppers\\" songs...
B00003CXB4|5.0|The second disc of this special edition gives the viewer everthing and more that one wants to know about the hit film.  Each bonus segment is short enough to captivate the &quot;small fry&quot; and detailed enough to satisfy the more mature fan of Disney's landmark film.<br />The only complaint that I have is the same one that I had about the film upon its initial release: it, like most animated films from Disney and most American studios, perpetuates stereotypes and subtle biases that are so easily recognized through the actors hired to supply the voices.<br />How could the offspring of characters voiced by James Earl Jones (&quot;Mufasa&quot;) and Madge Sinclair (&quot;Sarabi&quot;) come out sounding like Matthew Broderick (&quot;Simba&quot;)?<br />Why did the villain (&quot;Scar&quot;, voiced by Jeremy Irons) have to possesses a BLACK mane?  Doesn't this contribute to the notion that the color has some evil connotation?<br />Why were Scar's henchmen so easily recognized by the ethnicity in the voices of Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin?<br />Why did the all-knowing sage (&quot;Rafiki&quot;, the baboon) have to be voiced by a black man, Robert Guilliame?<br />Why did the &quot;comic relief&quot; pair have to come across as two New Yorker deli owners (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as &quot;Timba&quot; and Pumbaa, respectively)?<br />Maybe that's why this film, for all its financial success, did not get an Academy Award nomination for BEST PICTURE as did &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.<br />There were too many unintented &quot;slurs&quot;, of sorts.
B0000DJZ9T|3.0|Great energy.  Probably a great live concert.  However, the production quality both audio and video make this DVD a watch once and sell candidate for me.<br />I own over 30+ concert DVD's by a large variety of artists and styles.  In addition I have spent a great deal of time and money tweaking a pretty sweet home theater setup.  In addition I've been a musician for 20+ years.  I love music...get it?<br />Unfortunately the audio (even the DTS track) is rather MID-HEAVY with tons of vocal and guitar in an exaggerated mid-band frequency.  When you really crank it up (90+ dB) it become really annoying sounding.  The bass guitar starts to come through, but the drums can barely be heard even at these levels.  Just a poor mix.  Someone with the right skills could take the same source and make it sound awesome...like the mix on Eric Clapton's &quot;One More Car, One More Rider&quot; for example.  Now that's a nice sounding concert DVD!  One of the best!<br />The video (other than being kinda washed out) is just a bit over-produced for my tastes.  Too many quick paced camera angle changes.  Not a vivid concert, but that was probably just how the live show was...muted and monochromatic.<br />Unfortunately, the energy and performance are really great.  Only the average/poor production can be blamed for this &quot;listen once and sell&quot; product.  I guess the rabid fans may keep it, but not someone who is an audiophile and sincerely appreciates music when it is well performed and recorded.<br />Oh, well.  Maybe next time.
0385486804|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down after starting it.  I thought the book was well written and very interesting.  It haunted me for many days after I finished it, during which time I often thought about McCandless's journey and death.  While I think he took risks that most of us would not and he should have been more cautious, I do not think he was arrogant or ignorant.  We all make mistakes, especially when we are young, but his mistakes (and bad luck, to some degree) cost him his life.  I don't read a whole lot of non-fiction but I really enjoyed this book.  It was as easy to read as a well written novel.
B00005JMGL|5.0|When we saw the preview for this movie we thought that it would be just another remake on the old classic, nothing special.  Then we saw Jeremy Sumpter!  He is, in our opinion, the best actor that could have been picked to play Peter.  The rest of the cast is great too.  Jason Issacs is great as Hook.  We really felt that we could understand his character.<BR>One more thing: Jeremy, we love you, we are the same age as you, we always keep our windows open!!!

B00005JMTN|5.0|It is very seldom that trailer of the film tells the truth about it. I guess we can all accept the fact that they are designed to make people to want to go and see it. This was one of those occasions when trailer did not even do justice to the actual film. Big fish IS a modern day Wizard of OZ and more, IT IS A MASTERPIECE. This heartwarming and funny film brought to life by Tim Burtons inimitable imagination unravels a fabled relationship between a father and his son.<br />SYNOPSIS: Edward Bloom (Oscar worthy performance by Albert Finney) has always been teller of tales about his unbelievable life as a young man (Ewan McGregor) when his lust for adventure led him from small town in Alabama, around the world and back again. Tales that range from the delightful to the delirious give life to giants, blizzards, a witch and so much more.  With his larger-then-life stories, Bloom charms everyone except for his estranged son Will (wonderfully played by Billy Crudup) who believes that these stories have kept him from knowing his real father. When his mother Sandra (ever so talented and beautiful Jessica Lange) tries to reunite them, Will must come to terms with his father and learn how to separate facts from fiction. <br />Beautifully executed film. It is visually stunning loaded with brilliant performances, amazing story told in an equally amazing way. And I guess one lesson I will always carry with is this: when telling a story you've got two choices - tell the facts of events or REALLY TELL A STORY. <br />Go watch it. Anyone with an imagination will love it. I can not wait till this comes out on DVD.

B00005JM02|3.0|The *idea* of Pixar making a movie about fish is better than the movie itself. After Monsters Inc and two Toy Story movies, you could expect something special. But what you get is something mediocre --- bright and amusing but without any sophistication.<br />The scenes under the sea are far better than the scenes in the aquarium. The jelly fish and the sharks, in particular, are amazing. Once humans beings appear, the quality of the movie declines. The humans have the same inflated limbs and faces as the people in Chicken Run. That's good for Chicken Run, but not for this film. The aquarium fish and their home are dull. I liked the blowfish (and his voice) but the others didn't stand out.<br />It seems as if the animators' creativity was tapped out by the time they started to design the dentist, the aquarium, and the aquarium fish. Or, to make another quick comparison, look at the seagulls and the pelicans. The seagulls are like boneheaded Stormtroopers --- they're funny and intimidating. The pelicans, however, are as you would expect them to be. They aren't special.<br />I enjoyed most of the voices. Willem Dafoe and Ellen Degeneres stand out. Albert Brooks is also good. The boy who does the voice of Nemo is perfect. Overall, this movie is entertaining but a little boring. It feels like the plot was simplified and the fish were colored a little too bright so it would appeal to kids (and be easier to merchandise).
B000000993|5.0|Thier first full length album manages to kick some major ass. Unlike most Tool fans I'd consider this and Laterlus to be thier best album instead of Aenema, although that album is still awsome. If your new to Tool and you want to get a taste for thier sound before you buy it I'd suggest that other than the two singles \\"prison sex\\" and \\"sober\\" that you also check out the title track \\"undertow\\". If your a fan of good music you'll probably end up liking it. YEAHHHH TOOOLLLL!
B000003S2O|5.0|Brian Eno created a minor masterpiece with this CD. As a longtime heavy metal fan, I'm surprised at how often I listen to this. The music is deceptively simple, based on isolated keyboard notes and a background of natural sounds. It doesn't sound like a field recording --- you can tell it was created in a studio --- but it has a wonderfully organic feel to it.<br />The biggest surprise is that the tracks have so much variation. Like Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II, each song maps out a different piece of sonic territory. These songs are full of beautiful ideas and restraint. Buy this and you'll listen to it every day for years.
B00005LMBK|1.0|Before I took a look at this page I had assumed that everyone along with me had found this whole cd to be nothing but complete track. I think that it was the Clint Eastwood music video that had tricked me into thinking that this was a good band. I should have listened to my original instincts and stayed as far away from this...cd which is one song and about 17 fillers! The next time this album falls in my cd player hell will have frozen over and pigs will be flying!
0060005688|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much.  Having rules and constraints in society is a good thing and should be embraced.  This is an important idea of this book.  The Paradox of Choice explains how people arrive at the decisions they do.  This book also talks about the negative aspects of making decisions in a world with so many choices.  Finally, this book offers suggestions on how to make better choices and reduce stress.<br /><br />  Barry Schwartz makes many good points about decision making.  One of them is that because of the growing number of choices we are presented with, we don't always have the time to look at all the information out there to make the best choice.  Another interesting point is that people expect certain decisions to be made for them. In the health care field for example, we expect the doctor to tell what kind of treatment we need.<br />  I learned from reading this book that we should all strive to be satisficers rather maximizers.  A satisficer is a person who chooses a product or service that is good enough.  A maximizer is a person who is always trying to get the best product.  A satisficer is usually happy with their choice. In contrast, a maximizer isn't happy and often regrets what they bought.<br />  We should also try to stick our choices and not change our minds.  This is another way to reduce anixety I learned in the book. This is very hard to do consistently, but I thought this was a good piece of advice.  I also enjoyed the idea of being a chooser and not a picker.  Choosers have time to change their goals whereas pickers do not.  Choosers take their time making a decision considering all their options unlike pickers who do not.<br />  The Paradox of Choice is an excellent book with a lot of interesting information about the habits people have in making decisions.  It also has very useful tips on how to reduce anixety in your life.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Although I do enjoy the song &quot;weak and powerless&quot; I did not want a cd full of that mellow just this side of metal kind of junk. Being a Tool fan I've tried really really hard to get into this cd but like APC's last cd its very difficult to do. I can't really say that any song has a Tool like quality so if you havn't heard APC before don't go buy this expecting another Tool album because its not even close. This cd will really make you miss the greatness of Daney Carey. Sadily because of this Tool wont start making a new album untill this summer.
B00008H2LB|4.0|After many long sittings of listening to Meteora, it seems to me that much of the popular culture is focused on unchanged anger. Linkin Park's album just seemed to make this clearer. Don't get me wrong; the album itself is great. Like it's older brother Hybrid Theory, Meteora gives us the sound of rock and rap mixed together to create a happy medium. Chester gives us his glass-piercing shouts and screams again, and everything seems to be in balance. The only real complaint I have is that the lyrics really haven't changed in subject. &quot;I'm angry, I'm depressed, I'm going to kick you out, etc.&quot; We've seen that all in Hybrid Theory. Come on, guys. Do you really want your careers to drag on like Metallica did after the Black Album?
B000089RVX|1.0|I'm a fan of good music like Tool, Ozzy, Iron Maiden, etc...so when this crap started getting played all over my radio I was PISSED! How the hell was this ever put in the metal category!!! This is exactly the kind of music you would hear if Snow White decided she wanted be  hardcore...but at least if that had happened her music videos would have included some midgets!!! Theres a reason why some of the customers that bought this bought Jewel...IT'S THE SAME MUSIC EXCEPT WITH SOME UNIMPRESSIVE GUITAR. Another thing I'm sick of is people telling me that if you didn't like the &quot;bring me to life&quot; single that you'll like the rest of the album. So I listened to it and it took me till the cd ended to find out that the cd player WASN'T stuck on repeat!!!! DAMN YOU EVENSCENCE!!!!!AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
B000089RVX|4.0|When I first heard Evanescence, I immediately thought of another bad Linkin Park imitation. After purchasing Fallen, I couldn't realize of how wrong I was. The band sees to triumph on where Linkin Park falls. The most noticeable change from the mainstream is that there isn't so much hate in the lyrics. There is, could it be, purpose? Originality? Amazing! Who would have thought that this was possible in this day and age, and especially in this genre. And the lead singer, Amy Lee, is amazing. I haven't heard a female lead in a rock band for quite awhile, much less one that was somewhat good. But I must give credit where credit is due. Upon first placing the disk in my stereo, the first thing I noticed was how beautifully Amy's voice combined with the slamming guitar solos and passionate lyrics. In conclusion, put some time aside to listen to this gem. It's not so mainstream as you think.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I seem to rember the stupid people saying that even if you don't like Star Trek you'll like this movie. YYYYYYOOOOOOOUUUUUUU LIARS! This was not nonstop action!!!! Action is where thier lips stop flapping and thier ...tazers i guess START FIRING! I got fooled by two movies that had made similar statements. The James Bond movie that came out this year made promises that said that ddn't like Bond would like that. Next time I hear a statement like that I'm gonna march over to the nearest movie theater and piss on the projector!!!!!!
B000002H6C|5.0|I wasn't until a few years ago that I really started to listen to metal. In fact, there was a time where I wouldn't listen to anything other than Mozart and Elton John. However, Metallica changed my point of view of the genre completely. <BR>I bought Master of Puppets, via recommendations from friends, and I was blown away with the ear candy that it provided. However, it was &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; that really made my mind do backflips. The album is much more socistificated in the lyrical aspect than most of their other albums, and, despite many complaints that I've heard, much of the guitar work is what you would expect from the legendary band. Each song, in it's own right, is a masterpiece from beginning to end, and will no doubt have you coming back for more.
6305971099|4.0|For me there is nothing better than watching Donald Pleasence as Loomis. He's after a mad man or evil force whatever you want to call it and he seems like hes on the brink of insanity himself. The poor kids probably freaked out more by him than she is Micheal. Although  he doesn't have any great stabbing scences. Pitchforks add the excitment of 4 times the stabbing in this movie. GGGGOOOOOOOOODDDDD stuff
B000002H97|5.0|For me, and many other fans, Metallica died after this self-titled album. While much of the song construction is much different than it's predecessors, the Black Album doesn't fail to disappoint. Shorter songs overall DON'T mean worse. The lyrics aren't as good as &quot;And Justice For All,&quot; but they still stand out more than their newer titles such as &quot;St. Anger.&quot; I can't stress of how great the guitar work is in this album, and it could quite possibly contend for the best in all of Metallica's albums. If you're looking to keep on loving Metallica, buy the Black Album and end it there.
B000002KB8|5.0|The title track song is easily one of the creapiest songs ever written. You listen to the lyrics and you just get sucked in. Ozzy has been amazing since the very begining. Also some very great guitar work in this album espeically in the fourth track. Just all around good stuff.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw Translation for the first time and liked it, but didn't really know what they saw in the movie that was so beyond-belief spectacular. But alas, I believe that every movie deserves a second chance, so recently I sat down and experienced director Sophia Coppola's Lost In Translation again. <br />          Lost in Translation tells the story of Bob Harris (Bill Murray in a role tailor-made, if not even Heaven-sent for him), an American movie star that comes to Tokyo to film a whiskey commerical for which he will be paid 2 million bucks. Staying in the same Tokyo hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johanssen, radiant and mature at only 18), a newlywed tagging along with her rock photographer husband, John (a typically awkward Giovanni Ribisi). Along the way, Charlotte and Bob run into each other and begin a 'brief encounter' that profoundly affects them both.<br />          When the movie hits you right, it's a pure pleasure from its unassuming start (a beautifully lit shot up Johanssen's underwear-clothed behind) to its ambiguous but meaningful ending. It begins as a comedy of culture clash, Harris sarcastic and confused at the Japanese when entering his hotel, and even more befuddled in a hilarious scene where he shoots the whiskey commercial. Coppola delivers Bob into her movie with the impression that it'll be all about him, but Charlotte enters the story, and we're never quite the same. Scarlett Johanssen plays Charlotte with just the right amount of emotion that her initially morose and soul-searching character doesn't seem silly. At one point, she tearfully admits over the phone, \\"I don't know who I married.\\" Bob, on the other hand, seems to have it made, but Murray lets a current of loneliness run across that memorable face. He gets comical faxes from his wife about bookshelves and carpet samples, but he gives off the impression that he's come to the point where he doesn't even care anymore. Bob is certainly alone for a time in Tokyo, but Murray alludes that things at home aren't too hot either.<br />For the first third of the movie, director Coppola displays her first brave choice in filmmaking by keeping Bob and Charlotte apart. Upon my first viewing of Translation, I wasn't convinced of Coppola's choice to keep the movie so predominantly low-key, but I've realized that there's a reason for it. The movie sustains this amazing vibe that doesn't stunt its progress, but propels it with a driving fluidity. A few times, though, Bob and Charlotte do see each other without officially meeting. One time in particular occurs in a crowded elevator - the two glance at each other, faintly smile, and possibility is born. The first section of the film doesn't just serve to show its two characters completely apart - it makes you think of how many life-changing connections you've missed in the past by just being passive and solitary.<br />The two meet and begin voyages out into the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, and the film takes on a perspective that differs from its earlier view. Before, we saw Bob Harris and Charlotte, respectively, at their most private and vulnerable. While out on the town, the film seems to sit back and just let them have fun. Thank God, for Bill Murray's rousing rendition of Elvis Costello's \\"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\\" is a blast. During this time, it seems that Bob and Charlotte have forgotten their insomnia and loneliness, but it's not gone forever. Even during their night on the town, we see moments where they sit silently, pensive and confused. The movie is a comedy in some sense, but it escalates into a pervading tragic feel. At one point, Charlotte says to Bob: \\"Let's never come back here again, because it will never be as much fun.\\" They had fun, but only in the sense of putting off more loneliness.<br />It takes a while, but the motivations of each character become fully-realized in a marvelous scene where Bob and Charlottelay fully-clothed in bed together. Here, they handle the 'big' questions in life, and not \\"Where did you go to college?\\" or \\"What did you want to be when you were little?\\" but \\"What is my purpose?\\" and \\"Does marraige get easier?\\" I was amazed at the honesty of the character's responses. Bob relates to Charlotte the experience of having children and the ongoing struggles of marraige, but a tinge of fear and apprehension runs through his speech. Charlotte hasn't really figured things out for herself yet - she says she's tried just about everything but hasn't found that niche. Coppola's screenplay makes the statement that both are in the same exact emotional limbo. Charlotte is confused and worried, but Bob is regretful and washed-up. In a way, these two are some form of deeply odd soul-mates. That is the heart and soul of Coppola's amazing work.<br />Translation has great comedic flair with Murray's wonderful work, but it's also perhaps one of the saddest and most moving films I've seen in a long time. It's some form of a romance, too, but it's not about when they'll kiss or when they'll hit the sheets. It also has that Affair to Remember vibe too, where the journey of two souls that find comfort will eventually have to come to an end. Its end, though, defies classification, as does the rest of the film. Coppola simply lets her two amazing leads do the work. When the film does arrive at its final, ambiguous moment, it all just seems perfect. The catchy Japan-pop soundtrack that runs brilliantly throughout the film begins to play, and I find myself with a huge regret: that I won't be able to savor the subtle chemistry of Bob and Charlotte, and that a flat-out masterpiece in American film is at its end.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Nora Jones will capture the heart of everyone who has ever appreciated natural talent and deep,emotional vocals. Her songs will take you to a place you've always wanted to go in your dreams. &quot;Come away with me&quot;, the title song, is a journey to the &quot;mountain top&quot; that gives you &quot;the kiss&quot; of a life time. I am waiting impatiently for her next solo album. She could be the female version of &quot;John Mayer&quot;...Don't miss this experience.....
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|This DVD is unbelievable.  The song, &quot;In My Place&quot; blew me away, which really involves the crowd.  This DVD is a must-have for any music lover.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This epic movie tried to appeal to everyone bycombining a few genres. There's a big romantic triangle between very &auml;ttractive&quot;stars (to appeal to girls &amp; women), a lot of actions &amp; special effects (to appeal to the guys), and a lot of history, inaccurate as it might be (so the movie would seem more 'serious').<br />But the point was completely missed. Many people had to sit through a lot of romantic comedy &amp; drama scenes to finally get to the action / history parts, while those contained very little romantic sentimentality. And the 3 parts are as bland, standard and boring as they could get.<br />As for the cast: I've seen Josh Hartnett in much better parts than this. Ben Affleck's choice to get this part was obvious, since he was seeminglybtrying to build a reputation as an action figure. Both have a horribly fake southern accent. It's hard for me to understand why good actors such as Dan Ackroyd or Kate Beckinsale were participating in this hhorribly bland movie, but at least they added some class to it (and at least the world was finally exposed at such a large scale to the excellent Kate Bekinsale).<br />The special effects were probably amazing to watch at a cinema, but are far less impressive on a normal TV screen.<br />My reccomndation? If you're addicted to romantic fluff or action movies in whatever form they might take, rent this DVD before buying it.
B0000TB050|5.0|U2's performance at Slane Castle is unbelievable.  The band really gets involved with the crowd, making it seem like you're there.  The audio and video are unbelievable, making it one of the best concert DVD's out there.
020530902X|5.0|No one who writes should be without this book. That includes everyone from a student in school to a professor working on a scholarly paper. From a newspaper reporter to an award winning journalist. The book is such an amazing small wonder that, as has been pointed out by others, easily fits into your pocket so that you can always have it with you.<br />No doubt, as I write this, I am failing to follow guidance to be found in the book, but I actually referred to it while writng the previous paragraph, so hopefully you will find no erros in this review. The book is concise and advocates precisely that: concise writing. It remains an unparalled guide to proper, effective writing.
B000069HK2|4.0|This is a great album for everyone who likes emo-metal. His greatest vocal point is not mostly his scream but a yell in a couple parts of &quot;Box of Sharp Objects&quot;. I liked the album because I listened to it all at once and I heard some soft songs but these guys are going to get big! This guy (Bert McCracken) is the coolest because he can do all this emo-metal stuff without dressing up or painting his face or having a lot of theatrics in the shows(not that there is anything wrong with that) GET THIS RECORD
0385504209|5.0|This is a great book for art history and mystery buffs.  Because it discusses a lot about ancient symbology, which is really interesting.  The author has written the story in such a way that it wasn't easy for me to figure the ending....has a twist and makes u think as u read.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|As the title try to say, you can feel the European feelings, and that positive vibrations that reggae music spread all over countries, for instance, Denmark, Germany, France, etc. with utterly different customs, cultures and languages. The best live album ever released by the wailers features the strongest version of 'Exodus', as well as the most powerful version of 'The Heathen'.<BR>The wide variety of songs, extracted from differents album, make it really interesting and easy to listen to, even for those who don't like listening to reggae music.<BR>This album released in 1978, before 'Survival' and as a preface of the trilogy composed by 'Survival, Uprising 'and 'confrontation', has been remastered in 2001 and it's an excellent selection (of outstanding performances) of hits played during an European tour in Copenhague, Berlin, Paris, etc.  <BR>It also include 'Punky reggae party' (of course alive), which for reggae lovers, it's like the bible for those who are devoted to religion.<BR>To put it briefly, 'Babylon By Bus' should be in every reggae collection and thus, I am sure henceforward a better live reggae album will not be released.

B00006RU5B|1.0|If you pine for the days of arena rock and âmeaningfulâ lyrics straight from Creative Writing 101 ten Audioslave is the band for you. From the Cornellâs Robert Plant wannabe wail down to the Storm Thorgercon cover this is as uninspired as they come.<br />Yes Cornell as a great ârockâ voice, but he uses it in such obvious ways and with such laughably pretentious lyrics (Pearls of swine bereft of me â\\" yeeesh!) that it doesnât matter. Cornell takes something potentially dynamic and makes it clichÃ©.<br />The band is solid but constrained compared to the days of Rage. Morello and the boys make the best of it but it sounds like they sleepwalk through each song.<br />This CD does succeed in remained us that Rage Against The Machine was a phenomenal band tat took metal to new, interesting places and Soundgarden was just phenomenally overrated.
B00008DDRX|4.0|The single line that's necessary to understand this film -- if you don't have an instinctive understanding from the moment you hear the engines beginning to rev -- is McQueen's response to &quot;Why do you do it?&quot;.<br />He says (and i'm afraid i have to paraphrase a bit here) &quot;That out there, that's living.  Everything else is just waiting.&quot;<br />And that's the truth; for some people, living on the edge -- whatever it may be the edge of -- is the only time they feel truly alive.<br />The great British driver Stirling Moss's biography is entitled &quot;Everything But my Life&quot;.  Graham Hill, after retiring and taking a job as a commentator was asked if he missed racing.  He replied along the lines of &quot;Twenty-four hours out of most days, I don't miss it at all.  But when those engines start up -- I miss it more than anything.&quot;<br />McQueen's film catches this attitude well -- these are men with an obsession, a need to get out there and push themselves and their vehicles to the limits, and beyond.<br />(Limits?  Another Graham Hill story -- he took a car out for practice at the Nurburgring.  It was impossible for the car's suspension to allow its belly to touch the roadway.  He came back with all the paint rubbed off the bottom of the car.<br />(A car magazine decided to see how different drivers approached their art; they fitted a gran prix car up with full instrumentation and sent three different drivers out to run hot laps on the same race course.  As expected, the profiles of all three varied, some were faster on one corner, some on another -- but two of the three touched the car's theoretical absolute limits in acceleration or cornering force at several points on the lap.  The third exceeded them several times...)<br />If you want a RACING MOVIE -- one that gives equal emphasis to the &quot;Racing&quot; and the &quot;Movie&quot; part, this isn't it -- try &quot;Winning&quot; (with Paul Newman), which i believe Amazon is/was offering as a two-fer with this film.<br />If you want a racing MOVIE -- one that's first a Movie and secondly a racing sory (albeit with incredible racing sequences) try &quot;Gran Prix&quot;, with James Garner.<br />But if you want a RACING movie -- one that understand swhat and why racing is and lays it all out there, this is it.<br />Some Other Random Comments: One review mentions McQueen driving a race with his ankle in a cast -- it wasn't in this film, it was either Sebring or Daytona, and he only barely lost to Mario Andretti who was determined not to lose to &quot;an actor&quot;.<br />Almost all of the cars in this film -- including the Porsche which meets such a horrific end on the Armco -- were actual factory cars from the previous season, which were pretty much obsolete in the new season, and which the factory donated/sold cheap to the production company.<br />Except for the Ferraris -- Enzo read the script, said &quot;A Porsche wins?  No Ferraris!&quot;  The &quot;Ferraris&quot; which McQueen and crew took great pleasure in destroying are actually replica bodies on old Lola chassises.<br />Another review mentions that the tires on the Porsche can be seen spinning as it bounces off the Armco in slo-mo, and says that this is beacuse the accelerator had been jammed open to cause it to crash more spectacularly.  From what i heard at the time, the car was first smashed into the Armco under radio control at a speed approaching 200MPH; after it bounced off, a stutn driver got into it, strapped himself solidly in, and gunned it up to sixty or more MPH, hitting the barrier again at a sharp angle which resulted in several more bounces.  The tires are burning because it was wide open to enable him to do more elaborate spins and crashes.  (They cover up the cut between the RC crash and the controlled crash in the slo-mo sequence by one of the cutaways to McQueen's face as he relives the crash after everything comes to a halt...)<br />Feel the Need For Speed?  This is the DVD for you.DVD for you.
0385504209|1.0|Brown perpetrates a poorly disguised anti-Christian and Anti-Roman Catholic attempt at a suspense thriller. The unbelieveable plot twists and vain attempts at maintaining some minimal level of credibility strain Mr. Brown's slight talents to the breaking point. Venal characters, unsympathetic and sometimes ludicrous, leave us totally uncaring of their fates about half way through the novel.<br />Brown executes his craft at a breathtakingly amateurish level and insults our collective intelligences throughout the book. Such a novel preys on the ignorant and easily persuaded to promote a blatantly anti-religious message. That the book is boring is just one insult added to the rest.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|This isn't *quite* the ultimate &quot;chase&quot; film -- that would be either &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (for a relatively serious film) or &quot;The Junkman&quot; (for a comedy), but it's one of the better-acted.<br />Michael Caine and Noel Coward anchor the comedy nicely -- Coward's &quot;Mr Bridger&quot;, the undisputed head of the British underworld, ruling crime with an iron hand from a comfortable cell in a pirson where the warders and Governor act as his personalk service staff, is a wonderful conceit.  Caine's Charlie Croker, very much the smooth fast-talking all-round crook of working-class origins, plays off Bridger wonderfully to get permission to do the job, to the point of appealing to Bridger's obsessive patriotism (God *is* an Englishman) by pointing out that stealing four million dollars in Italy will help the balance of trade.<br />Roughly half the film or a bit more is devoted to getting the gang together (including hiring a computer expert [played by Benny Hill] who may be the single most over-the-top element in a film that hovers at ot near that metaphorical &quot;top&quot; for most of its unning time.)<br />A recent poll in Britain voted the line &quot;You were just supposed to blow the bloody *doors* off!&quot; as the best all-time movie line (i prefer the similarly-inspired &quot;Think you used enough dynamite, Butch?&quot;, but won't quibble); it's certainly appropriate...<br />The gang have to do the job in spite of the Mafia (personified by Raf Vallone) -- after, all, this is their home turf and the Brits are invaders -- and this conflict leads to the horrific destruction of some simply lovely Sixties high-performance cars on a mountain road -- the punchline to the opening credit sequence is particularly painful, because so unexpeced.<br />Use of the original Mini Coopers[1] as the getaway cars is inspired; their small size, excellent handling, good turn of speed and the fact that they were currently being built under license by an Italian firm based in Turin, the setting of the heist, all contribute to the fun of the chase.  And the efforts of Remy Julienne and his stunt team certainly don't hurt; the knowledge that all of these stunts were done for real, not by computer imagery, is impressive.<br />By 1969 the Mini in all its variants was history in the US, and though it continued in production worldwide for thirty years more, the American market diodn' reward the film-makers as well as they might have hoped, and the sort-of-planned sequel in which we see how Charlie and Co get out of the (literal) cliffhanger that ends this film was never made.<br />Since Amazon is offerenig a two-fer of this DVD and the actually-not-bad (if not great) exercise in BMW product-placement &quot;remake&quot; with Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, one might do worse than to get both of them and spend an otherwise-unoccupied afternoon comparing them, spoting the little grace-note references to the original inserted into the &quot;remake&quot;'s unrelated plot.  (Certainly a more-rewarding afternoon than one would have doing the same with the badly-acted-but-incredible-chase original &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; and the execrable 2000 &quot;remake&quot;...)<br />The Bottom Line: The better of the two &quot;Italian Jobs&quot; (not surprisingly).<br />[1] History: The Cooper and Cooper &quot;S&quot; were high-performance variants of a small car produced by British Motors under the Morris and Ausin names; not all Minis were Coopers.  The &quot;S&quot; used a larger, more powerful engine, was banned for emissions rerasons in the US in 1966, the car itself was unable to pass crash-test standards in 1967 and so disappeared from this country.<br />Production continued in England (and in Italy under license, which leads to a gag in the original film) for many years after that, but was finally discontinued.<br />The Mini was the first of the &quot;two-box&quot; subcompacts with transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the direct ancestor conceptually of the VW Rabbit, Honda Civic and so on; none of them, however, used anything like its unique &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; suspension, which was completely hydraulic, with no springs or conventional shock absorbers.<br />It was smaller than those, at somewhere between 1500 and 1800 pounds and using ten-inch wheels.<br />BMW bought the name, and has recently brought out the car they call a &quot;Mini Cooper&quot;, much the same shape, but much bigger and more luxurious -- the BMW &quot;Cooper&quot; weighs almost 3000 pounds and uses wheels as large as fifteen inches.<br />Those of us who cherish the original Mini in all its variants are not decieved...irect ancestor conceptually of the VW Rabbit, Honda Civic and so on; none of them, however, used anything like its unique &quot;Hydrolastic&quot; suspension, which was completely hydraulic, with no springs or conventional shock absorbers.<br />It was smaller than those, at somewhere between 1500 and 1800 pounds and using ten-inch wheels.<br />BMW bought the name, and has recently brought out the car they call a &quot;Mini Cooper&quot;, much the same shape, but much bigger and more luxurious -- the BMW &quot;Cooper&quot; weighs almost 3000 pounds and uses wheels as large as fifteen inches.<br />Those of us who cherish the original Mini in all its variants are not decieved...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|They WERE on the same path. Not anymore. I think Stripped and In the zone tell you everything. It was pretty natural to compare them in their bubblegum pop days. A small comparisn - (Hasn't everyone been doing that??)<BR>  In the Zone is a fun CD, slightly personal and mostly filled with dancy sort of stuff. There are hot beats here and the lyrics won't be able to tell you anything about the artist. It doesn't have to when you're out to have some fun. Till the tenth track, you'll be dancing to the CD. From 'Shadow', it's time to relax because except the remix of MATM, the rest of the songs are a bit more of the Britney style. 'Everytime' is a perfect way to end the CD.<BR>   Stripped is completely different and chances are you won't be dancing when you're listening to this. You'll be thinking about her well-worded lyrics and the deepness and powerfullness of Chrstina's voice. <BR>  Now is the time to stop comparing these two pop princesses. Both of them have, as someone said, definately parted. <BR>I would give all the songs from IN the Zone a perfect ten with the exception of Early Morning which I'd rate 2(Spoilt the essence of her album) and Everytime which I'd give 15.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|No matter how anyone feels about Michael's personal life, you cannot deny that he made a prominent impact on pop culture. &quot;Thriller&quot; is a prime example of that. Even though I feel &quot;Off The Wall&quot; is little better in my opinion, &quot;Thriller&quot; is still a great record. The disc has all of of Thriller's original 9 tracks &amp; also includes 3 bonus songs &amp; interviews w/ the Quincy Jones, etc... who were involved w/ the making of Thriller.<br />On the other hand, the bonuses I could have definitely done without. In my opinion, they should have made a 2nd separate cd for the bonuses so that those like myself could enjoy the &quot;Thriller&quot; album in it's original format if they chose to. Some of the bonuses are interesting, but IMO not neccessary. <br />Overall, Thriller is a great buy...no ifs, ands, or buts, about it. It's a CLASSIC!! Hardcore MJ fans will get a kick out of the extra bonuses and others will still love to listen to the original &quot;Thriller&quot; songs.
B000089RVR|3.0|It is...well right down the line...boring but safe. I don't love it but I like it. I definitely agree that Tori Amos puts this cd in the garbage so to speak but Life for Rent still has some qualities, such as Dido's voice herself. Yeah if you like metal you're going to probably yawn but if you like alt. rock or folk, or contemporary (gag) adult, this is an album you can go with.
B00006JKOM|5.0|I simply can't understand why people get on Ian for writing something a little lighter than was usual after yelling at him for confusing them with &quot;A Passion Play&quot;.  Just because something is different doesn't mean it's bad.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This cd is one of my favs. Mainly because the score is wonderful. Actually no. It is not wonderful. It is more of a mediocre score that becomes a let down every now and again. But when it has its moments, it has its moments. There are songs that stay in your head forever (and no that is not a bad thing in this case). The performers are incredible and the orchestrations are to die for. Stephen Schwartz has a way with words in his ballads. So many potential songs could be sung in the pop world (As long as your mine, For Good, I'm not that Girl) The show is brilliant and you really must see it in order to understand.<br />The lack of a synopsis in the booklet is mainly because there are so many plot twists and surprises that it would ruin the show for you. The lack of pictures doesn't really give you a feel of what kind of feel the show is trying to have. But it is definatley worth your money. ONe of the best bargains of the year.
B00000K44W|5.0|First I'd like to say that it's beyond hilarity to compare Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull to Paul Simon in any way, Jeremy.  <br />On to the album.  Except for the prolonged ending of &quot;Mouse Police&quot; the album is flawless.  The musicianship and vocals on this album are stunning.  Too bad everyone can't see that.  But, to quote &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, &quot;Mine is the right to be wrong.&quot;
B000002JSR|5.0|Led Zeppelin acomplished so many things in their career they released this not too long after John Bonhams death. The band had called it quits and figured to release this with studio recordings, and outtakes. I bought this not too long ago at Fye Music for a great price. I have to say I dont listen to this as much as my other Led Zeppelin CD's but I still love it. I love to listen to Led Zepppelin's studio recordings as well as their live recordings so this CD soothed me well. I love the version of I Cant Quit You Baby on this CD its very powerful. I also love Wearing And Tearing without a doubt this is one of the best Zep Cds. This is up to a true Zep fan either buy this and be satisfied or dont and miss out. So Enjoy!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This CD gets replayed in every possible place that I go. The lyrics speak volumes, Chad Kroeger again hits it right where listeners need it. The music is awesome, better than Silver Side Up. A must have for any Nickelback or Rock music fan.
6305922756|5.0|This Is Spinal Tap (Special Edition) includes the best sound quality and picture quality ever. This movie is one of the funniest on my list. I also love the bonus features when they show outtakes or follow ups on the movie. This is without the funniest rock n roll band ever. This will be a classic so why wait go add this to your collection. For the best price buy this on amazon and Enjoy!

B00005JMJ4|4.0|This movie lives up to Sofia Coppola's previous work of \\"The Virgin Suicides.\\"  Coppola proves through this movie that a lot can be accomplished without a lot of action.  Realizations, friendships, and lives unlived that are desperately trying to find a way to release themselves are the main motifs and themes of this movie.  I understand that many viewers don't have a strong respect or appreciation of a movie without a generic love story or gobs of action and unnecessary violence just for the sake of being violent, but this movie is literature in the form of film.  <br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect compliments of each other.  One character is a middle-aged man with no real ambition but half a life lived and gone already.  The other character is young, new to marriage, and uncertain of where life goes, how life goes, and what will happen in the end.  <br />I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed movies such as The Royal Tenenbaums, The Virgin Suicides, Igby Goes Down, and Rushmore.  Existential, different, and thought-compelling are the three words I will leave you with to describe this movie.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|After first hearing &quot;Chariot&quot; on the radio last July, I rushed out and got the album. Gavin DeGraw's voice is smooth and rough at the same time, comforting and disturbing, and, in general, amazing. His piano skills are amazing and powerful, but they don't overpower his touching lyrics, only fuel them. While all the songs are beautiful and accessible in terms of relating to the lyrics, there are a few that really stand out for me. &quot;Anyway&quot; is a chill yet danceable tune about a guy who meets a great girl, but passes up on her offer to date or whatever because he just got a girlfriend who is even more amazing. &quot;Chariot&quot; channels Billy Joel's vocal talents, Elton John's mad piano playing, and Stevie Wonder-style lyrics, three of the great performers of all time, rolled into one great performer and one amazing song. &quot;Want To Be&quot; is the theme song for &quot;One Tree Hill,&quot; and with good reason. It is, in my opinion, the best song I have ever heard about being true to yourself, sending that powerful lesson through without being sappy. Rather it has an alternative yet classical rock sound that all generations can relate to (case in point: my younger brother loves it, and my parents and grandparents love it). Gavin DeGraw is destined to join the ranks of Billy, Elton, and Stevie in no time.

B000002VTE|4.0|I reviewed this album way back when, and having just gone back and looked at it again I feel my words were much too harsh.<br />The first five songs are, how you say, macnifique, there is simply not a dud in the bunch.  The title track utilizes layered vocals and plush keyboards to full effect, and tugs at the heart strings all the while.  `Stay With Me' may be my favorite J. Spaceman song committed to tape, and it is a song that is best appreciated after one has accrued some worthwhile life experiences.  `I Think I'm in Love' is replete with drug references, but at its heart the song is the pain of lost love given a melody and impeccable production. `Electricity' does not really fit on this album, as its artistic noise is off base with every other song, but it is a good song nonetheless.<br />I could do without the three forays into free jazz - `Home of the Brave,' `the Individual' and `No God Only Religion' - but wading through those to get to `Broken Heart' and `Cool Waves' (another track that proves Jason Pierce's talent for adroitly applying gospel melodies to songs dealing with anguish) is more that worth it.  Album closer `Cop Shoot Cop' was a track I did not appreciate at first, but after seeing it performed live several times I aquired a newfound appreciation for the album version.<br />In short, I could do without the jazz songs - they're really not my bag and I would have preferred three songs with lyrics and melodies - but after having built up some life knowledge these songs have a new meaning to me.  I didn't appreciate it at first, but now I don't know what I'd do if I didn't own this album.
0446310786|5.0|When I read this book I was really surprised. Not too many books we read in school are actually books I like, but this one was different. The way Harper Lee portrayed it all through the eyes of six-year-old Scout made it different too. The innocence and understanding of a child through times when the black and white were still not equal helps you really get into this book, especially when one black man is being tried for rape against the white trash of the town and inevitably loses. Even after Atticus puts up the best opposing fight ever. After the trial a the hate is turned on to Atticus. But when someone goes after his kids, something has to be done. Before it gets out of hand. What happens? Read to find out.
0425098478|4.0|After the 60's and 70's, the terms reinforcement and punishment held negative cultural connotations that seemed to equate people with Pavlov's dog. Blanchard and Johnson's One Minute method presented scientifically validated behavioral psychology in a way that managers of the time could feel comfortable with. Thus, if you apply these ideas, you will not sound like a psychologist circa 1950. Instead, you'll sound like a Politically Correct 1980's management consultant.<br />Despite its age, the method is simple -you can read it in half an hour- yet extremely powerful. First, define the behaviors or results you want (One Minute Goal Setting/ Activator), then let your reports go out and perform. During the performance, you offer reinforcement in two forms, positive or negative. Catch someone doing good, you give them a One Minute Praising (positive reinforcement). Catch a report doing something bad, you give them a One Minute Reprimand (punishment/ negative reinforcement). The result is classic operant conditioning and behavior shaping.<br />I use the concepts in this book regularly. They are simple and very effective. Once you know where you want people to go, the behavior shaping methods presented in this book will likely get your team there, and quickly. One Minute Managing is a surefire way to increase the quantity of actions which add value, while minimizing those which detract. I would recommend Aubrey Daniels' `Bringing out the Best in People,' which goes into operant conditioning in more depth, as a very solid companion for this book.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence's debut CD is absolutely amazing.  Titled Fallen, when I first heard their song from Daredevil, &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; I was in LOVE!!  It was the kind of song that made all sorts of emotions run through my body at once - especially when I saw the music video.  I got the CD for my birthday from a friend, and if CD's could be 'worn out from listening', this one would be.  But Evanescence, in my opinion, will never be worn out.  Amy's voice, blended with the amazing lyrics that you can sometimes just *identify* with and Ben's great guitaring take you to an alternate reality for some really great listening.<br />I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes hard rock and beautiful visions. :)
0385507755|5.0|The best piece of post modernist stream of consciousness literature I've ever read! It may be shocking to see that there are no quotation marks, indented paragraphs and that all the margins have been slashed in half but once you start reading you won't care.<BR><BR>The protagonist is a dynamic character that doesn't just change by the end of the book ... he seems to demonstrate subtle changes every few pages. There are some incidents that are hard to read (I have yet to read the toenail-pulling section) but the claustrophobic pages keep you riveted and turning.<BR><BR>For addicts who despise the 12-step process and the ultimatum that you believe in a higher power or you relapse, Frey's experience becomes cathartic and therapeutic. (Maybe that's why it is on its 7th printing in less than 9 months.)<BR><BR>Even if you're not an addict don't care about memoirs don't need any fancy-shmancy stylistic attempts at literary genius you'll enjoy this book. I hated to put it down. In fact, I opened it just to read the first paragraph before bed so i would look forward to getting into it the next day ... i ended up reading for two hours straight....
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Apparently you missed the point of the movie.  I don't know which language you saw it in, but maybe you couldn't read the subtitles.  &quot;Our hero's&quot; (Xavier) life goal was in fact to write, if you recall that several times in the movie he mentioned he wanted to write, and that is what he does at the end of the film.  What he abandons is the bureaucratic job that certain pressures are forcing him to take.  And by the way, I have not seen this dvd version, as I don't think it's been released in the U.S. yet, but the cover is rather deceptive.  Audrey Tautou has a minor role and her character is not very pleasant, so don't buy this if you are looking for another Amlie.  Ciao, a plus.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Amazing album! One of the best Christmas albums ever. Buy it!
6305041156|2.0|A.Kurosawa is Japan's George Lucas.  They are both great epic storytellers and have both made samuraï serials ; yet they both have an aggravating tendency for &quot;fusion culture&quot;.  By fusion culture I mean an artificial blending of cultures that embodies the hope of a cosmopolitan betterment for humankind.  Examples : Star Wars, Star Trek TNG, Afro-Celt Sound System, Esperanto, europeen sushi, Ran, etc.  <br />Visualy : scenary beautiful, thow special effects for blood **actual ketchup** suck big time!  Better to see &quot;The Last Samuraï&quot; if you want realism for combat.  <br />Soud : has no dubbing whatsoever!  Interesting wind effects for tempest.  <br />Dialogue : you'll find a few interesting proverbs in the subtitles, such as &quot;the hen pecks the rooster and makes him crow&quot;.  Hardly any text at all, images talk for themselves.  <br />Acting : Lear's buying his stairway to heaven, the Fool looks like a cross-dresser, all the other major roles are convincing.  <br />Story : has major cuts (in an effort to reduce lengh) that riddle the play with non-sense.  Edmund, Shakespear's most notorious villain besides Iago, is cut out.  The Gloucester/Edgar duo is fusioned with the Lear/Fool duo, causing the Fool to stay after the tempest, even to survive Lear's death.  Much better to see sir Laurence Olivier's King Lear to understand the play.
6305609705|3.0|First, let me say on behalf of the men who served in Vietnam, that this is a work of fiction. Most were too busy fighting for their lives to murder innocent men, women and children. Yes, there were several incidents in which American soldiers committed atrocities, but for every one of them there were 20,000 honorable men and women who served honorably. Again, this is fiction and it shouldn't be interpreted any other way.<BR> Now that we have that straightened out, I'd like to comment on the film. This is not a \\"war movie\\" and to label it as such would be unfortunate. It is a story of one man's journey into the heart of darkness (however you may interpret that) and it just happens to be set in Cambodia. Whether or not it makes any sense (I have yet to figure it out), it's still a beautiful picture. The camera angles, lighting, soundtrack...haunting combination. I can honestly say it's one of the few films that I've enjoyed simply for the visual/sonic aspects.<BR> Squeamish, politically concerned (far left or right), children, stay away. Otherwise, you might find this interesting.
B000000WA4|5.0|I'm not one to write these reviews, but JEEEZ... this album is too freaking great.  I spend too many two hour blocks just listening to MCIS and this time I thought, why not write a review while it's playing?  Great idea huh?<br />What I like most about these songs are that you start listening to them and then you think that they are great... then somewhere in the middle of the song Billy pulls out these fantastic new melodies or guitar solos that just blow your mind and you have a whole new appreciation for the song.  Here are reviews + some highlights (my track times should be universal right?)...<br />Dawn to Dusk<BR>MCIS - 7/10 - listen to the whole thing.  Will prepare your mind.  If you don't listen to it first, you will blow up.<BR>Tonight Tonight - 20/10 - Favorite song EVER!!!  oh man.  You have to listen to the whole song, or I will come over there and put my stereo outside your house and blast it.<BR>Jellybelly - 6/10 - Exactly what I was talking about in my intro.  Decent song at first, but then it gets genious... 2:04-2:36<BR>Zero - 5/10 - I don't mean to invoke wrath, but overall unmelodic song.  Some parts VERY catchy, though.  And of course, I was right again, there is some genious in it... 1:37-1:52<BR>Here is No Why - 9/10 - I didn't really hear this on the radio that much, but it's definitely radio-worthy.  Good overall song, but chorus is rocking, and guitar solo is one of the best... 2:24-3:29<BR>BWBW - 8/10 - This song is great, though admittedly I think it is a bit, a BIT only, a bit repetitive.  0:00-0:04 (The world is a vampire.. da na na nah na na) of course is a must listen.  Otherwise, the freakout at the end is great... 3:38-4:16<BR>To Forgive - 6/10 - Not a must listen, but a decent song.  No standout parts :-(<BR>FU (An Ode to No One) - 7/10 - Oh man... at first I kinda hated this song.  Then now I still kinda dislike the beginning, but the verses got better, and the ending is brilliant... when he starts screaming \\"no way!! I don't needit!\\"... must listen... 3:26-3:48.  \\"NO WAY!!\\" Ok, listen to it again.... 4:04-4:25<BR>Love - 5/10 - EH... you know how when you listen to great albums you don't want to skip any songs?  Love is definitely good enough to not skip when you are listening to MCIS.<BR>Cupid de Locke - 3/10 - um.... this is pushing it.  I can't seem to get a hold of this song.  It's just that Billy sounds kinda... um... fruity...  Others seem to like it, so hopefully the rest of you are not cursed with disliking a Smashing Pumpkins song like I am :-(  Oh yeah, and what's with talking during songs??  It's like Boys II Men :-)<BR>Galapagos - 8/10 - Beautiful!  Beginning is kind of slow, but it is all made up at the end.  I think everyone will agree with me in... 3:20-3:57<BR>Muzzle - 7/10 - I know this is a good song, but I don't play it as much as other songs for some reason.  One of those songs that you say 'man what a great song' when you listen to it but when you are choosing a favorite song or songs the name doesn't pop up... no track selection as it's pretty evenly good all through.<BR>Porcelina of the Vast Oceans - 10/10 - YES!!  An epic!  Cutting out the first two minutes and the last, this song is one of those long songs (making it 6 minutes) that never get boring, and sound as long as a regular song (yay Hummer!).  I wish those three minutes weren't there, it's like Where the Streets Have No Name by U2, if you know what I'm talking about.  But you still see the 10/10 don't you?!!  Pure genious and great guitars... 6:21-7:28<BR>Take Me Down - 4/10 - Billy throwing poor James a bone?  Man that was kind of mean huh?  Sorry James for that - I appreciate your work and your help in writing Soma/Mayonaise (both spectacular), but this wasn't a good song, not even if Billy sang it.  Well.. it wouldn't fit Billy's voice in the first place, but still it's the song and not you, James, you can rock on!<br />Whew... ok take your pulse.  If not beating, I guess you'd better stop for now.  Otherwise, listen to Tonight Tonight again, drink some water, and get ready for more :-)<br />You didn't listen to Tonight Tonight again did you?  Pfftt.  Whatever man.  Anyways, here's your chance to do it.<br />Twilight to Starlight<BR>Where Boys Fear to Tread - 5/10 - Not the most pleasant sounding song, but decent intro... 0:28-1:21.  Sadly it ends without that spark of genious to blow our minds.<BR>Bodies - 8/10 - Heh heh.. but this song CERTAINLY does.  Beginning is good.  From midway into the song until the end is one of the best Billy Corgan freakouts ever!... 2:50-4:02 (freaking does not start til 3:20)<BR>Thirty-Three - 8/10 - This was one of my fav songs at first, but now it's just a 'very good' song.  No standout parts, but that doesn't mean anything bad, some songs just don't have any parts that stand OUT.<BR>In the Arms of Sleep - 9/10 - I really like this song.  I really really do.  Very melodic and a song that you can just keep on listening to.  It's also a slow song, and I keep on telling myself it's just a phase, as most slow songs get boring after a while, but this remains a regular playback... 2:00-2:25 \\"And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me\\" is a great line.  Not that I identify with that.. i really don't.. Heh heh... no way man... :-)<BR>1979 - 10/10 - Duh... how could you not like this song?  It is too bloody catchy!!  No track selection.  It wouldn't matter anyways, once you get to 0:05 you are going to be 'screw the online stranger i'm going to listen to the whole bloody thing'   And you better....<BR>Tales of A Scorched Earth - 4/10 - A lot of people on forums and stuff say this is the song out of them all they would take out of MCIS.  I can see why, but like Love I can still listen to the whole song without reaching for the skip button... maybe.  If I'm feeling good.<BR>Thru the Eyes of Ruby - 10/10 - Another brilliant lengthy one!  Except they cut out any filler, even the ending has this nice melodic part which could probably be another song of it's own.  But of course Billy has so many melodies in his head he can spare one for a 30-second ending.  The track selection is definitely definitely the part where he starts screaming \\"the night has come to hold us young\\" 4:36-5:30<BR>Stumbleine - 7/10 - Something about the word stumbleine that has an excellent meaning to it.  What does it mean?  I don't really know, but something good.  No standout parts.  See Thirty-Three for 'good songs but no standout parts' explanation.<BR>XYU - 8/10 - Usually I don't like songs like these, but there is something about this song that strikes me.  It's beat, or lyrics, or just general Billy screaming I guess.  Could be a 5:00 song probably, but is seven... 4:55-5:26<BR>We Only Come Out At Night - 9/10 - According to the fan database, this song is ranked like 90th, which is understandable, but I like it a lot because it is catchy and a feel good song.  A great beginning of the end of MCIS.. get your tissues out :-).... 2:45-3:16<BR>Beautiful - 7/10 - A good song.. it fits.  Some say beautiful, though I am not inclined to agree or disagree... 3:29-3:52<BR>Lily (My One and Only) - 7/10 - Wow, a song you can actually catch all the lyrics to.  And it tells a funny story too :-)  No track selection... you probably need to listen to the whole song to get the whole jist of it.  Shows how amazing Billy is, to be able to come up with all that other stuff, and then a song like this...<BR>By Starlight - 7/10 - These are all getting 7's because on their own I probably wouldn't listen to them.  But on the CD it just freaking FITS!  Once you get here if you have been listening to all the songs you definitely won't skip this.<BR>Farewell and Goodnight - 8/10 - Eight of ten??  As I said, listen to this alone and you'll be like what the heck?  But in the CD, this will put you in tears.  Just too good.  Hail Billy.  Listen to the whole bloody thing.<br />*sob that's it.  Anyways, you all have just witnessed another 'best two hours of my life' :-)
B00003CXUM|5.0|I was born in hongkong in 80's,and this movie portrayed the love between a journalist and his neighbour in 60's.Their love was unconventional when compare to the social taboo at that time.I found it the most fansinating that their attitude towards each other and the tone of their words were ambiguous!!After watching it,I search many pictures of Hong Kong in 1960's.They are wonderful and I love them so much.Nowadays,many hong kong students rare notice the bright side of Hong Kong in the past.They neglect the history and culture of Hong Kong.However,this movie , in fact, provided lots of pretty accessories and furniture in the 60's.They are incredible.<br />Besides,the sharp contrast of colour made by Wong was remarkable.The clothes were extremely beautiful and unique.The angle that Wong tried to shoot from the reflection of mirror was actually carrying out confusing ideas and ambiguities.Some of the scenes were blurred by rain ,shadow and smoke,maybe rendering a sense of escape and moral depravity of Chow.<br />Over all,the ending scene shot in AngKor Wat was excellent!!I love the quote ::: &quot;He remembers those vanished years.<BR>As though looking through a dusty window pane,<BR>the past is something he could see, but not touch.<BR>And everything he sees is blurred and indistinct.&quot;<BR>Though they have no future , they had once continued sacrificing,or giving, simply for each other.The background music &quot;Theme&quot; was also a great supplement!!
0385504209|1.0|Why oh why is this book so popular? It's writing is okay, not stellar and not awful, but it's based entirely on a theory that has been around since the 1970s, based on the works of a French conman from the 1950s, which has been derided and laughed at and proved utterly false ever since, but now that it's wrapped in the clothes of a thriller it's being hailed a 'new' and 'exciting' concept? Are these people insane?
B000002JPA|5.0|I think Dream Theater is a band you either fall in love with or dont like.  What I don't see as possible is people that HATE Dream Theater.  There are so many good qualities about Dream Theater that it has to be impossible to totally despise them.  I just don't get it.  Anyways, this is a very good album, you can listen to it to fall asleep because of songs like &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; and &quot;Wait For Sleep&quot; that are all very relaxing and peiceful.  I own almost every Dream Theater CD.  I would own them all, but lack of funds has seen that I haven't.  The only 2 I don't have are &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; .  This CD is Definitely one of the top 3 of their cd's.  All of them are soo good it is so hard to Classify one as the best.  I think if you are a new listener to Dream Theater, you should start with &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot;  which is probably their most accepted CD.  I'd have to say this is my second favorite Dream Theater CD.  My favorite being &quot;6 Degrees of Inner Turbualnce&quot; which didnt seem to be most peoples favorite, but it was mine, because of all the different kind of songs they had.  This should be your second or third Dream Theater buy.  It IS a must-have for any prog-metal fan.  Dream Theater has totally changed my life, and brought it back into a posotive light.  Maybe even saved my life.  I was so sick of all the mainstream crap and one day my cousin told me about Dream Theater and it totally changed my life.  It isnt just Dream Theater thats good, all of their side bands are good too.  You could take every member of this band and put them in another band, and that bands CD sells would go up 50 percent, thats how good EACH ONE of them is.  If you are into Dream Theater and looking for other good bands along their lines, why not just go to their side projects....Liquid Tension Experiment is Dream Theater - LaBrie and Myung who is replaced by Tony Levin, agreat bassist.  Their music is all instrumental but still nonetheless captivating.  If you really like LaBrie's singing, check out Frameshift, another band where he is the lead singer (check progrock records).  Portnoy the God of Drums is also present on a few bands including OSI and Neal Morse's album Testimony.  Rudess has A new Solo Album coming out, (check DT's homepage then his site for sound samples)  For anymore information just check out Dream Theater's Homepage----  [...]  I hope this review was Helpful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I managed to stumble into this show more interested in the better-advertised John Doe, and didn't get hooked because my schedule didn't allow me to be free on Friday evenings.  I saw the first, second, and last episodes in the series, and while I enjoyed it, I largely forgot about the show.<br />Turns out I was wandering around Mediaplay looking for Christmas gifts just when the Firefly box set had reached stores (and was not on the new shelf).  I decided to give myself an early present and gamble the $35 on a hunch that it'd be worth it.<br />I watched the series with my roommates, and got them hooked, then went home and watched it with my brother and got him hooked, and all in all, got a couple of people to buy the series.  Every one loves it, and after several pages of Amazon reviews, I have yet to see one of less than 5 stars, or any with less than the highest praise for Joss Whedon's creation.  Anyone who mentioned Fox has the same contempt for them I do.  Thankfully, Joss *is* making the movie - supposed to be out in 2005, for Universal Studios (which may or may not have merchandising and TV rights as well), and the scoop on that right now is that the contractual stuff is being taken care of.<br />Best TV show ever.  Everyone who's seen it agrees.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought this cd almost a year and half ago, but I still listen to it every day.At first I didn't like it, but now I can say that it's the best cd ever.I liked her from the begining, but now I just love her. The best balade on the cd is Walk away. She really sings with heart. I also like I'm ok, where she revealed her past.Very positive song on the album is Keep on singin' my song.The song which extremely suprised me was Get mine get yours, where she introdused diferent side of her: &quot;We have a physical thing, we make love but don't fall in love&quot;! The best cooperation is in Can't hold us down and maybe even Impossible.<br />She really is stripped. Through this album we can get to meet the real X-tina. She inspired me so much, because her lyrics have a message.Beautiful or Underappreciated  for e.g.<BR>She is the best!!!!!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|An album with no fillers is a rarity these days but that is what you have here with in my opinion No Doubt's greatest album.  Like with the singles from this album when you pop this in your computer you are greeted with a film clip (Hey Baby) as well a Rock Steady screen saver and making of Rock Steady documentary.  Lyrics are included in the cover booklet as well.<br />No Doubt experiment in a few songs on this album such as Underneath It All, which has a few Jamaican style verses. Start the fire has a bit of an island congo line thing happening in the beat which is quite good.  Apart from the huge Hey Baby and Hella Good songs my favourites would be the catchy song Detective and In My Head.  Fans of ballads will not be disappointed with the song Running. No one will be disappointed with this album.
B00008AY3L|5.0|sure, the disc may be a little un-focused, but isnt that what makes music interesting? from past experiences, i have learned that the label given to a cd (rock/pop...ect) isnt really related to the what the songwriter/singer had in mind in the first place. a true musician is one that doesn't always look to the labels placed, but rather looks to what the music is actually about and the meanings behind it. i hope that the conclusion that this is a beautiful piece of work, will be reached by many.
B00005B36H|5.0|I reviewed this album when I first got it, but I really need to review it again.  Although it blew me away from the first listen, it isn't until now that I'm really appreciating its greatness.  \\"Lateralus\\" is one of those albums that just gets better and better with each listen, and it just completely envelops you every time you listen to it.  I have to give this album special credit for really getting me to take notice of the great band that is Tool.  I bought \\"Aenima\\" several years ago, and while I've always considered it a great album, it was never really a favorite of mine.  However, when I bought this, all of that changed.  I couldn't believe how amazing this CD is (and I still can't), and it has helped me to appreciate the rest of their work a thousand times more.  It's taken way too long, but I can finally say that Tool is one of my favorite bands.<br />I'm gonna try to keep this brief, because there are already so many great reviews describing this album in great detail, but listening to \\"Lateralus\\" is just an exhilarating experience.  To many, it may seem long and ponderous, and maybe even boring, and that's understandable, but I just love the feel and pace of this album.  The songs are long, majestic, and full of dynamics and subtlety.  A song can slow down to nearly nothing, and build into ferocity within the blink of an eye.  The musicianship here is just sublime, full of complexity, but still so very fluent and minimal.  From the mesmerizing \\"Reflection\\", to the ferocious \\"Ticks and Leeches\\", to the extremely dynamic \\"The Grudge\\", to what is quite simply one of the best songs I've ever heard, \\"Schism\\", there is no second of this album short of brilliant.  Maynard's talent is just bewildering, and often frightening.  Listening to this never ceases to give me chills.<br />For years, I wondered why so many people were so fanatic about Tool.  I've always liked them, but I never really got what the excitement was all about.  Now I do.  While I would not ever put myself on the level of the most rabid and brazen Tool fans (you will never find a more devoted fan than that of Tool), I most certainly love and admire the work these guys do.  And better yet, just look at the impact this band has had.  I mean, there are fans of all different musical styles, be it metal, prog, alternative, numetal, etc. that listen to Tool.  There aren't many bands that have made such artistically daring music that appeals to so many different tastes.  The only one that really comes to mind is Pink Floyd.  Tool is definitely one of the most important bands of the last ten years, and I can't wait to hear what they'll come up with next.put myself on the level of the most rabid and brazen Tool fans (you will never find a more devoted fan than that of Tool), I most certainly love and admire the work these guys do.

B0000DD7NL|2.0|This is basically a weak rehash of Alicia's superior debut album. Several intros sound like intros on the first album and what the album is lacking is strong melodies! A great voice and talented piano player she is, but her songwriting skills leave to be desired. And lose the cheapo drum sounds and use a real drummer next time, please! <br />There are no stand out tracks apart from You Don't know My Name, so I doubt the album will yield as many hits as the first one did.

6305537321|5.0|I've always loved Audrey Hepburn. I remember watching Sabrina and Roman Holiday at a really young age but this is the movie that really struck me. There is something so unique about Holly Golightly thats not found in any other book/movie. The movie starts with Audrey Hepburn stepping out of a taxi early in the morning with pearls, dark glasses and a fancy black dress holding a bag of pastries and staring at the window of Tiffany's. That image is stunning, plain, naive and thoughtful all at the same time. And the movie is the same.<br />The only gripe I have about this movie is the ending. The book ends it so appropriately because shes a wild thing who can't be tamed and she ends up doing what shes...supposed to do (?). but here, the ending contradicts the MAIN theme of the movie by making it too happy go lucky...(don't want to spoil it) This movie is too ideal, too plastic and that detracts from its originality. Holly Golightly is NOT a socialite. Shes a call girl. Her apartment is not that luxurious. She shares it with Mad Madge. Rusty Trawler was not her suitor because Mad Madge stole him from her and he turned out to be gay.<br />  Also, most importantly, the book is written in terms of the narrator looking back. Paul received a postcard from Holly and thinks about her. Its a story of nostalgia and freedom and the movie fails to establish that.<br />  Still, a very good movie in itself.<br />Holly (on viewing a stripteaser): Do you think she's talented? Deeply and importantly talented?<br />Paul: No. Amusingly and superficially talented yes, but deeply and importantly, no.

B00006JJ51|5.0|Yes, this is perhaps one of the greatest albums of all time for any genre.  Straight Outta Compton sparked a good period in music, and shined the spotlight on the Los Angeles rap scene.<br /> And to answer one dude's question, I believe the 6th guy on the cover was a guy Dr. Dre was working with at the time, by the name of The D.O.C.

I read alot of different authors and he ranks right up there with the best,James Patterson,Jeffery Deaver. I read some of the other reviews and alot said this wasn't one of his best. Well then, I MUST read those others cause I thought this one was very good.. I can hardly wait for the next one. I just hope we see more of King and Maxwell.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones may or may not be a great singer - with only one major set under her belt, it's too soon to say. But there is no question that set sounds exceptionally good in the SACD format. The more recent copies of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; are hybrid - with CD and SACD layers on the same disc ... and the SACD version knocks the socks off the standard CD. The bass end is much fuller, the vocals even smokier and more rounded, and the SACD version has the elusive &quot;presence&quot; we're all looking for in the format - the sense that the artist is THERE in front of you.Even if you are tiring of this material, hearing it in SACD is liking earing with new ears.
0375713751|4.0|This is a superb story that is well written and thought provoking. I recommend it highly. It is the story of Kate Reddy, a British working mother, who has a difficult time juggling her high power career and her family life. The story is told with incredible feeling, personal insight and great humor. The characters are exceptionally real and loveable, and the plot will carry you along until the end. I rate this book very highly and don't understand the reviewers who did not do the same.

B0000024JN|5.0|The Beastie Boys are the most revolutionary white performers since Elvis; they both took an African American style of music (rhythm and blues and hip hop, respectively) and made it accesible to mainstream white listeners. The Beastie Boys also pioneered the whole &quot;rap-rock&quot; genre that permeates the airwaves these days with such artists as Ratm and Linkin Park. Everything they did in their time was unheard of, and they forged ahead into unexplored musical territories throughout their debut Licensed to Ill. This contains many of their mainstream hits, including &quot;Rhymin and Stealin&quot;, &quot;She's Crafty&quot;, &quot;Girls&quot;, &quot;Fight for Your Right&quot;, &quot;No Sleep Til' Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Paul Revere&quot;, and &quot;Brassy Monkey&quot;. More than half of the album made it to the radio. Thats damn impressive. Drenched in samples and with razor sharp lyrics, this is definetely one album that you can't go wrong with. If you are into that whole rap rock genre, pick this up and see where it all began.
B00000JMOJ|2.0|If you like 80's action movies at their cheesiest, &quot;The Running Man&quot; stands head and gorgonzola above the rest. Spandex outfits, neon sets, and a Harold Faltermeyer score--all it needed was an E.G. Daily cameo. Other than the nostalgia appeal of its &quot;Miami Vice&quot; view of the future, though, the movie is pretty awful.<BR>One clue to the movie's awfulness is the sole screen credit to Steven De Souza, who gives lie to the &quot;too many cooks&quot; theory of screenwriting; solo scripts by De Souza (Commando, Street Fighter) are always worse than scripts in which he shares credit with others (48 HRS, Die Hard 1 and 2). The bad Schwarzenegger puns are in abundance, and the rest of the dialogue is never as clever as De Souza seems to think it is.<BR>But &quot;The Running Man&quot; does have one thing going for it, and it's not Arnold--it's Richard Dawson, who has a grand time sending up his &quot;Family Feud&quot; image as a smarmy game-show host whose charm is even less than skin-deep. Dawson, no stranger to mediocrity (he was, after all, a regular on &quot;Hogan's Heroes), knows he's not doing Shakespeare, but he seems to be having the time of his life. If the rest of the film had risen to the standard of his performance, &quot;The Running Man&quot; might be more than a generic 80's shoot-em-up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard about the show before. Western-style sci-fi with horses, pistols and all that? That sounded somehow cheesy, but I bought the DVD set anyway and I am glad I did.<BR>The DVD set offers one of the best values from any sci-fi shows. First the production - I watch DVD's in a light controlled room on 100 inch screen and I must say this is visually probably the best looking sci-fi show on DVD to this moment. The sets, camera and CGI is really top, film like and you have no visual clue that it actually is a TV show. The DVD transfer is also one of the best looking. No artifacts, crispy image.<BR>The story and characters are also top a TV can offer these days. They all are multi-dimensional and well acted. They do change, surprise and are generally fun to watch. There is a snappy humor in each episode driven by the dialogue between characters.<BR>The story is a good mix of humor, action and suspense. There is a little bit connection between episodes mostly when characters refers to previous situation but otherwise each episode carry one story.The show actually really starts to fly in about second half of the season, with the season premiere as the weakest episode.<br />There is no second season and never will be. This may be the a serious flaw for some viewers. When you really get hooked on it it is over. Too fast and too soon. Especially that having a DVD you would really want to watch two or more episodes per evening.<BR>There is maybe a good point in having only one season - at least the show doesn't have to die of lack of imagination as many multi-year shows do. So now the writers are free to give us something new.<BR>I would recommend this not only for Sci-fi fans, but also for any other viewers. You can see it as western or sci-fi or simply a good show.
B000001ESN|5.0|It has been my experience that when I ask a fan of Rush which album is their favorite the choices usually come down to two, of which &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; is one.  This virtual axiom holds true for me as well, some of the finest music I have ever heard was recorded here.  &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; is a phenomenal kick-start with amazing interplay from all.  While &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; and &quot;Entre Nous&quot; are both exceptional prog-rockers, the top song of the album is a battle between two masterpieces: &quot;Freewill&quot; and &quot;Natural Science.&quot;  &quot;Freewill&quot; utterly destroys your will to function, except to drop your jaw in amazement. I saw these guys three different times in concert and it wasn't until the last show that they played &quot;Natural Science.&quot;  There is nothing like hearing that song live while watching three of the finest muscians on the face of the planet pull it off flawlessly.  Now, there is a touch of filler on the album; but it is forgivable filler.  &quot;Different Strings&quot;  is not on the same level of any other song here, but that really isn't fair to compare a decent Rush song with some of the best work of their careers.  Overall, the music is astounding, and the lyrics shine, as per usual.
B000007UXD|5.0|one of the worlds best rock album of all time
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I am shocked at all the negative reviews that are being posted about this exceptional album. I mean don't get me wrong there are bad things to say as well as good, but everything must be taken in stride. I have been a Dream Theater fan since 1999 and I must say that this is one of the few groups who need to be heard. Still...if you are looking to get into this group I am sorry to say...you may not want to start with Train of Thought. The message Dream Theater sends is a very cool one, especially with `As I Am', basically giving the finger to the mainstream. Still, with this new album, Dream Theater didn't really try to come up with something fresh as they usually do. In 2002 When Six Degrees was released it was very impressive to see Dream Theater get extremely heavy in sound, but when Train of Thought came out it was as if Six Degrees was released again. I think Dream Theater should go back to their previous work and try and figure out a way to blow their loyal fans out of the water like they use to. I am sure we would all love a Metropolis Pt. 3.
B000066C87|5.0|GOSFORD PARK was a nice surprise. The movie was purchased as a gift for my husband and I and we had no expectations because we didn't know what the film was about. It is a British film, and although we recognized the faces of a lot of the actors, we were glad to have the opportunity to learn their names. The acting was superb!  <br />The story takes place in the 1930's at a country estate in England called Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle invites a large group of guests to a weekend hunting party.  The movie begins with Constance  (Maggie Smith) leaving her estate to travel to the event along with her driver and maid.  We're treated to wonderful scenes as the guests arrive with their own assemblage of various servants. The often-snobbish guests are assigned rooms and at the same time their servants are in the kitchen receiving their own room assignments. The interesting part is to see that the pecking order for the Earl's guests is not that different from that among the various servants. <br />The camera scans the room while people are talking and it's difficult to hear most of the comments. I guess the director was giving us the feeling of being in any large place where dozens of people are making small talk. Constance is very snobbish and we get to clearly hear her views about the other guests. When a murder takes place, a bumbling detective is brought in to solve the crime. He doesn't have a clue, but several other people are able to surmise what happened. Everyone has his or her own individual stories and that's really what makes this big film work.  I found myself more interested in what was going on with the servants than I was with their wealthy counterparts.<br /> I especially enjoyed the acting of Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi and Maggie Smith.  Jeremy Northam as a Hollywood star gives an excellent performance and also demonstrated a great singing voice.
B000067CPX|5.0|Ok...I've seen so many people talk about how they don't have the same sound as they did 10 or 15 years ago...WELL OF COURSE THEY DON'T!!!  I have every RHCP album and they are by far my absolute favorite band.  I don't think they've made more than six or seven songs in the past twenty years that I just don't like.  Most of the people who don't like this album, who many claim to be such \\"huge fans,\\" don't know much about music and have little or NO understanding of it.  I'm not saying just the RHCP's music, but music in general!  I like a wide variety of musicians because of their lyrics and what they put into it...not just a catchy sound. <br />To anyone who hasn't bought this album yet, the songs on it are truly amazing.  My personal favorite is Dosed.  If people look past the whole, \\"It doesn't sound like Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" then they will find that the lyrics are just as good if not better at times.  Also, the feeling of the music and lyrics sounds so much more mature than in the past.  I'm glad that they've grown as musicians and haven't put out three identical albums after Blood Sugar Sex Magik!  I highly recommend this album to anyone.  Actually, I convinced seven of my friends to get it and they all loved it.
B000001ESP|5.0|I was looking over the list of songs here and it is incredibly obvious that this CD holds some of the greatest music I have ever experienced.  This is a true masterpiece.  I know that word is thrown around, even by me, but this time the moniker fits perfectly.  &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; are both perfectly arranged and performed with musical virtuosity gleaming in each measure.  &quot;YYZ&quot; is a fine instrumental that is exceptionally written prog-rock with a stellar production sheen.  &quot;Limelight&quot; was my personal favorite of theirs for a long time and still ranks highly in both musicianship and master lyricism.  The first time I heard &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; I thought it was the most frightening song ever recorded (I was 11-years-old, what do you want?); and &quot;Vital Signs&quot;  has some more dazzling lyrics and infectious, ableit fairly simple, lead guitar.  The only down-point I might consider analyzing is &quot;The Camera Eye,&quot; which is lenghty but not necessarily progressive.  Still, it isn't filler.  Besides, the remaining songs are so overwhelmingly astounding, I don't mind a little mediocrity.  This is a masterpiece, to be sure.
B000002HMH|2.0|never thought my favorite band could go that low.unless your rich dont buy this disasterpiece,sorry for being so thruthful but this is not metallica.
B0000DI7UR|3.0|After Elements Pt.1 was released I was running all over the place converting fans left and right and constantly saying just wait for Pt.2! Thank goodness I was the first one of all my friends to buy it...it gave me enough time to give them my input before they all got it. I was expecting Pt. 2 to be the `Empire Strikes Back' of sequel albums, but instead it was more like `The Matrix Reloaded'. Elements Pt.2 is not a terrible album, but like another band I love `Dream Theater' it was as if they didn't try hard enough to bring something new to the fans. There are highlights in this new album such as `I Walk To My Own Song', `Awaken The Giant', `Luminous', `Dream Weaver' (A grand duet between the two Kotepito and Tolkki) and `Liberty'. The rest makes you say to yourself \\"Heard it before.\\" Or, \\"It was great the first time I heard it.\\" It was almost as if something was up with the band itself and it turns out there was. Now with Strat looking for a new drummer and lead singer, you can't stop but wonder...Elements Pt. 2 could have been the last great Stratovarius album. For their sake I hope after the band is rebuilt their next album is something great.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This film will draw you in and hold you.  I admit, I bought it because Salma Hayek stars in the film.  Later, my ex-wife (also an Artist) reminded me that &quot;Frida Kahlo&quot; was one of her biggest Inspirations (not in style, but as a role-model).<br />Salma Hayek did an astounding job of recreating the person and world of Frida Kahlo.  I was so impressed by this film, that I actually took the time to watch the &quot;making of&quot; section of the DVD--which I strongly suggest viewing, as well as the film, itself.<br />I loved this film so much, I also purchased a copy for my ex-wife--as a Birthday present.  This would be a great gift for all Artistic people--especially women--however, it would also be a great gift for people who are Challenged by various handicaps.<br />Frida Kahlo certainly persevered through many challenges and personal traumas, but did not give-up.  I can see why she would be an amazing Role Model for young women!
0385507755|5.0|Talk about a powerful message! 'A Million Little Pieces' is not for the weak of heart. It is a very accurate and thorough description of not just the misadventures of an addict, but the mindset of an addict. It is a rough ride to read; there is an abundance of raw material that embodies the raw emotions of addiction. In terms of accuracy and entertainment value it is as viciously engrossing as 'My Fractured Life.'
B0000DYJM6|5.0|It's almost baffling that this is a B-Side album.  Songs that didn't fit on their studio albums, or songs that the band didn't like very much.  Well, if you piece together 10-12 of these &quot;B-Side&quot; songs carefully, you could probably construct Pearl Jam's best album to date.<br />I didn't like the fact that they redid the vocals for some of the songs... personally, I liked the originals of &quot;Driftin&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;Wash&quot;, and &quot;Alone&quot; much better.  However, they're still good with the 2003 vocals dubbed over.<br />My personal favorite songs on the cd are, &quot;Sad&quot; (which amazingly was left off Binaural), &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Fatal&quot;, and of course, the oldies but goodies &quot;Footsteps&quot;, &quot;Dirty Frank&quot; (which was slightly altered), and &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;.<br />A must have for any Pearl Jam fan.  You just won't find any B-Side album in Rock N' Roll history as good as this one.  It's truly remarkable.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think that this CD brings out the best out of britney spears.  I used to think of her very differently, but honestly this album brings out a much better Britney Spears.<BR>Cool songs!! I love them.
B00005JLYW|4.0|I bought this one on a whim--and it did, in fact, prove to be whimsical.  From the very beginning of the movie, I knew that &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; would not get me through the film.  So, I turned-off the analytical portion of my brain-pan, and rolled with it.  I found myself laughing, out loud, while watching &quot;Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.&quot;<br />Everything about this movie cracks me up--from the girl's goofy behavior, Spoofy Slapstick Comedy, and hilarious Over-The-Top Deductions that would make Sherlock Holmes raise and eyebrow... to the fact that &quot;The Boss&quot; has no clue what he is supposed to do and the Villain plays such a Straight-faced counterpart to the movie's general Free-for-all Goofiness.<br />Also, this DVD comes with a video (and guest performance) by one of my favorite Singers:  &quot;Pink.&quot;<br />This is definitely a movie that will require many viewings to catch all of the subtle, and not-so-subtle jokes, and background humor.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although I'm an avid reader and film watcher, I've never taken the time to post an Amazon review. I'm doing so for Firefly in the hope that some TV exec somewhere will bring this remarkable show back. Each episode was a huge affirmation of heroism, rationality,independence,and integrity. So rare to see such portrayed in the wasteland that is television...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the DVD set because I'd heard that the series<BR>was quite good, and $35 didn't seem like a whole lot<BR>to lose if it wasn't.<br />Wow. What a great show! I'm sorry I missed it while<BR>it was on TV. Strong characters and story, and I have<BR>to admit the whole &quot;western-in-space&quot; idea makes me smile.<BR>Sure, the concept smacks of cheesy 1950s sci-fi, but<BR>the execution here is flawless and the results are very<BR>compelling. The only reason I can see for this show being <BR>cancelled was that it wasn't promoted enough and given<BR>time to build a fan base. I know that I hadn't heard much<BR>about the show when it was on the air.<br />Anyways, great stuff. Recommended!
B000002AS3|5.0|The turn of the year 2004 has been a most difficult one for me upon realizing that a full decade has now passed since the release of Oasis' \\"Definitely Maybe\\", an album that literally grabbed me with a chokehold and wouldn't let go until two albums later when the band seemed to show that they were mortals.  Highly talented ones, but mortals nonetheless, capable of a daft song here and there.<br />The lesson of Oasis' career is that the brilliance of their early recordings was largely fueled by youth.  And nowhere were they younger than on \\"Definitely Maybe\\", naturally.  From the general insouciance of \\"Rock and Roll Star\\" and guitar fury of \\"Supersonic\\" to the youthful pining of \\"Slide Away\\", this album showcases the brilliance of the young Oasis - in Noel's not-yet-recycled riffs and Liam's not-yet-fully-sneering voice - and ten years on, it still sounds vital, the hallmark of any enduring rock album.  It also, amazingly, seems remarkably innocent despite the obvious thefts from T Rex on \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\" and the Seekers on \\"Shakermaker\\".  This is the sound of the death of grunge music, and what a glorious sound that is.  This album made me believe in rock and roll again.<br />\\"Definitely Maybe\\" is a keeper, and has officially survived the test of time, even though it brings about a bit of melancholy realizing Oasis will never be so young again.  What I wouldn't do to recreate the feeling of hearing \\"Live Forever\\" for the first time.
B00005O3VC|4.0|Python have been gurus in my life since I was a kid in the 70s.  I've always liked their absurd attacks on every institution in the world, and their staggering creativity and originality.  Their TV show is still my favorite thing they've done, but Grail has more than enough to make it classic.  I love the filmmaking of this film--Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam are working on a pitiful budget, on location, and for the most part this looks great.  Imagine if people in the middle ages had cameras and decided to make a documentary--it might look a lot like this.  These directors are clearly knowledgeable about artistic films from directors such as Ingmar Bergman, and their knowledge gives the movie a texture and tone you just don't find in comedies.  But this isn't just any comedy.  If you're looking for something light and fluffy, you won't find it here.  Even the rabbit is a vicious killer!  Take the scene early in the film with the guy collecting dead bodies in a plague village for a fee.  The animal and human dung, the groans of terminal illness, a cat being beaten to death against a wall, then a man being beaten to death for \\"nine pence\\"--you get the idea.  But nevertheless the scene is funny.  If you like that scene you'll like the rest of the film.  Still, it is a mighty angry movie.  It condemns the violence behind legends like King Arthur (a towering performance from Graham Chapman, absolutely convincing, one of the finest straight men--even though in real life he was gay--in a movie comedy), organized religion, and western philosophy.  One more thing--the characters who make me laugh the most are Tim the Enchanter, Roger the Shrubber, and the Old Man on The Bridge of Death.  (Terry Gilliam's presence as actor and director and animator on the movie is a marvel--a great way to see how his career as a great director started.)  Like all Python films it has peaks and valleys; some scenes last too long, some are based on a thin concept, some push it as far as mixingthe gruesome and the madcap, like the Tale of Sir Lancelot where John Cleese as Lancelot slaughters or otherwise brutalizes a bunch of women, children, and old men at a wedding, rather bloodily--too much here, I think.
B0000VAFNQ|2.0|Not much originality in this film.  Mostly it tries to emulate the look, feel, sound, and mood of some better films (&quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Crow&quot;, etc).<br />Special effects are very good, but even that can't save a dull script and the slow pacing.<br />There's an old maxim in the theatre that goes, &quot;If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.&quot;  If the script isn't compelling to read, no amount of spiffy set dressing, effects, etc will elevate it to a higher level.  Same here with &quot;Underworld&quot;.  It looks good, but the script anchors it down to sub-par level.<br />A friend loaned me this DVD to watch, so at least I didn't have to shell out any $$ for this.
038572179X|2.0|This book came highly recommended, so I was excited to read it.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed.  While it is obvious that McEwan is a creative and artistic writer, his book does nothing to hold one's interest.  Pages of unnecessary description and little action make \\"Atonement\\" a painfully slow read.  Fortunately, things pick up a bit in parts II, III and IV (191 pages into the book), but not enough to make reading it worth it.
B0000025P9|5.0|One expects a backlash to anything that is overtly successful.<br />One also expects a backlash when something is extremely polished and professional sounding.<br />To all the reviewers who have lambasted or said this album is worth only two songs (which makes it better than the first TOTO album) -- think of songwriting like somebody building you a house. Now if you find a person who builds you a house, you move in, and you find it has charm but is built like c**p, you of course will be pleased with how it makes you feel, but disappointed that what you paid for, you didn't get. Now say you find another person who builds you an expertly crafted house, but it lacks a certain homely charm. Does that mean you race back to the cr***y house?<br />Songwriting is a craft, like any other trade, any other thing you can do with your mind, hands or both. Like blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers, the artist / musician is constantly developing and improving their technique and proficiency to present you (a person who may not be skilled in such a craft) a thing which is well presented and should suit your tastes in somehow,someway. Whether this is overall, or momentary is up to you as 'the buyer'. But if you're satisified at least once, then they have succeeded.<br />And TOTO succeeded with TOTO IV in a major way. To fault them for finally honing a songwriting craft after 4 years of steady work, and 10 years of professional session work, and that people of all types responded to it enthusiastically, is more to do with you than them. I'm not trying to look at TOTO IV with rose coloured glasses, but one thing that cannot be found on here is bad musicianship.<br />As a musician, I learned an immense amount of craft from TOTO, and I will always be thankful to them (primarily the Kimball / Hungate / Paich / Porcaro / Lukather / Porcaro lineup)and I find nowhere else in their first four albums where this craft is presented so refined and polished than on TOTO IV. To maybe a listener who is just looking for gripping songs, or dramatic flourishes, or fits of anger or paeans to love, they will not find it here. For me, what I look for is someone who cares about what they're doing, shows it, and walks away saying 'I did my best'. And TOTO IV delivers that.<br />How anyone can say 'Waiting For Your Love' is a filler tune to the likes of Africa and Roseanne, I cannot comprehend. Have you actually heard the groove of this song? I hate to get all imploring, but have you heard the way Jeff Porcaro plays the hi-hat on this song? If it was jazz great Harvey Mason, you may say different, you might even listen, because its Mason and you're supposed to, but the playing of these musicians is almost perfect - the right amount of technique and feel. So it's alright if its Steely Dan, but not TOTO aye?<br />'Waiting For Your Love' and 'Good For You' are absolutely my favourite songs on here for the reasons stated above, the musicianship and playing skills of these people, and how much it adds to just a song. If you cannot find heart or soul in the playing of these musicians, or at least some passion for what they are doing, then maybe I can only suggest picking up an instrument and learn these songs, because you will find how 'on' you have to be to play them with as much 'feel' thats in them.<br />I just think you have to be at a certain point where crash crash bang bang just doesn't hold as much interest any more, and funnily enough I reached that point at 20 years old. And I thank TOTO for showing me that being a musician is more than just flicking your hair, and drinking booze and talking about your car.ho is just looking for gripping songs, or dramatic flourishes, or fits of anger or paeans to love, they will not find it here.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched only a few episodes of this show when it originaly aired on FOX, and pretty much forgot about it. I could kick myself for that. Like alot of people I was very confused about what it was. Due to the awful way FOX treated it. Now that I have seen the show in the way it was intended I am amazed. I have never seen a show this briliant and thoughtfully executed. It is awsome. The writting is Josh Weadon and his crew's finest work, the look of the show is very original, and some of the images alone from this show are masterpieces in their own right. I believe that if everyone had a chance to see just the first disk in the DVD set they would rush out to get the complete collection as soon as posible. If you are having at least the smallest incling to buy this set you will not be disapointed.
B00005JMFR|1.0|A series for uncritical 13 year olds of all ages.  <BR>The entire point of this dubious business seems to be cram every tired old B movie plot device into one story and power it up with a special effects budget that rivals the gross national product of some of the smaller European countries.  Devotees rage at such criticism by citing the cool stunts, spiffy costumes and endless explosions that go on ad naseum.  But we've seen this ALL before and done better elsewhere.  The plot is just not there!<br />And from reading about how this series came about I can see that the Wachowski boys spared no effort in using every hook and device they could think of to create a piece of merchandise that would return a maximum yield on the studio's investment.<BR>The studio isn't touting them as great film makers because they make great films but because the Wachowski's have found a way of stealing money from children that's safe and legal.

006054094X|4.0|I'm giving this book 4 stars for one main reason - it brings forward a new theory that many other scholars believe *is possible* but does not prove that it *did happen*. However, not enough evidence is available yet to conclude that Gavin's theory is just fiction.<br />I am a graduate student in history and just attended (today) a panel at the annual American Historical Association's meeting in DC. Mr. Menzies and several prominent, scholarly Chinese historians (including John Wills and Valerie Hansen) spoke on a panel about his book. I went to the panel expecting to hear the scholars shoot down Mr. Menzies' book. To some extent, they did. However, when Mr. Menzies stood up and presented new information on DNA and, more importantly, some brand new documents out of Fuijan province in China that came from a Chinese historian there, the academic historians were interested in further investigation (mostly the documents, but each admitted they  cannot say the Chinese *didn't* reach the Americas).<br />As someone training to become an academic historian, I will say this about what I got out of today. One of the historians on the panel made quite possibly the best point out of everyone -- something I will remember as I now look more seriously at this theory put before us. There are many, many unexplained pieces of evidence that Mr. Menzies brings forth in this book. For instance, the maps that existed before the European explorers, showing the perfect shape of Africa, South America, the Azores, etc. Now, the Chinese may not have discovered these per say, but until someone else can prove that ANOTHER group of people were the first, or that there is another explanation for these curiosities (because it is agreed the Europeans were usually not the first) -- who are we to heavily criticize Mr. Menzies? After all, we have no explanation of the Chinese artifacts showing up on the West coast. We have no explanation of how South America was perfectly drawn on a 1424 map - maybe the Arabs did it? Fine, go out and try to prove that.<br />So, when you pick up this book you should sit back and look with a critical eye but you also need to look at it like a lot of other historical issues - a possible explanation or theory used to construct a narrative that will connect the past in our minds.<br />As for those who believe the historical narrative they teach you in the public school system, keep in mind that what you learn in school is WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS YOU TO LEARN! Think about it. (Also, pick up a copy of &quot;Silencing the Past&quot; by Michel Trouillot, who discusses how certain &quot;powerless&quot; people are silenced in history -- in his case he discusses the Haitian Revolution. Reading a book like that gets you to think differently about a theory like the one in this book). What we teach our students in schools today is already missing so much and simply &quot;accepted&quot; narrative anyways.<br />One last thing about this book -- use the companion website to view evidence and all evidence updates. Mr. Menzies mentioned it several times today in his discussion as it contains a lot more and the newest evidence he presented to us today -- [...]

B00008MLSH|5.0|Those of us in the San Francisco Bay Area first met Anna Netrebko in 1995 as Lyudmilla in Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmilla.  She was in her early 20's and showed great promise as a lyric-colortura.  Now, after listening to her first recital disc, I would have to say that she has the potential to be one of the great new sopranos of the 21st Century.  The first thing I noticed is her distinct timbre.  In an age where sopranos are a dime a dozen, her silky-dark tone is a great welcome.  Her technique is excellent for the most part, sans some problems with pronouncing a few consanents here and there.  The only major gripe I have with the disc is that some more aria could have been included.  Supposedly, she sang Violetta at Covent Gardens to great acclaim so maybe adding Sempre Libra would have been nice.  Anyway, I was fortunate enough to see her Lucia Di Lammermoor in Los Angeles last year and she pretty much brought down the house after the mad scene.  Anna will be singing Musetta in San Francisco in June.  Do youself a favor and check her out live if you can.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This album is the greatest rock album of all time.  Eddie did things on this album with the guitar that other guitarists haven't dreamed of.  Eddie was the first to popularise two hand tapping.  Secondly, his sound (the brown sound) was completely original.  The music is first rate.  Eddie is the Chopin of the guitar.  He set real rock music on it's way.  Cheers to Eddie; you are the greatist rock guitarist of all time.<br />Steven Gallipoli
0156012197|1.0|If you would like to experience the Little Prince as the brilliant book it is, DO NOT READ THIS TRANSLATION!  The translator obviously missed the key points that make this book the treasure it is.  The \\"Matters of Consequence\\" phrase is changed throughout the story, completely destroying one of the main themes.  Also, more complicated words have been replaced with simple words.  Instead of elephants being very cumbersome they now take up a lot of space.  Ack!  Again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TRANSLATION!  It is for silly grown ups who have forgotten what it is to be a child.  Big words are okay, they help children learn.  If we continue to over-simplify things, not only will we be robbing our children of a stronger education, we will have created a new form of literature that is boring for all.  Long live the old version!!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the ideal soundtrack.  Whatever traits you believe make up an ideal soundtrack, this one has all of them, and I mean it.  This is unbelievably entertaining to listen to; you will be in a euphoria for hours after hearing this wonderful collection of music.
0385335482|5.0|This is the second time I am reading this book.  It's so good to read because Rebecca doesn't seem to understand that she is putting herself in debt because of her excessive spending.  But yet, it's so funny because she can't seems to figure out why she is in the mess she is in.  She is no financial whiz but yet writes for a financial magazine.  This book in one way, is helpful for any woman who finds herself in debt or is close to it.  It shows the reader what not to do and what you need to do.  Kinsella does a great job at pointing out the effects of consumerism and what it does to the individual in society without boring the reader.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I love Tim Burton, his a genius. This movie has to be one of his best to date. Tim Burton is one of m favorite directors, and this is definantly one of the best movies I've ever seen and tht he ever did. This movie is a definant must see. It's definantly one of the best movies you'll ever see.'Till next time. Later.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I have to say it. This album is trash. It hurts me to say it. I feel that gwen is the most attractive, best hope to take up the female lead in the punk/ska genre. She is backed by some amazing, creative, and versatile musicians. She has the perfect punk ansd ska voice, and i even think she is the perfect candidate for the hip-hop crossover act along with Pink. however, when I heard this ridiculous piece of trash, i thought to myself, &quot;if only she could sing without using words. maybe if it was in a language that i didn't understand.&quot;  then i wouldn't be embarrased at how juvenile and useless the lyrics are. The album is supported only by the underneath it all track. That track is a lovely gem, but not by any means lyrical genius. the lyrics on the album overall recall the worst efforts of the 80s--cyndi lauper's &quot;a night to remember&quot; was ever better than this album. <br />musically, her band suffers through this album bravely, but without any enthusiasm. <br />please!!! tim armstrong!!!!  write some lyrics for no doubt.  remember when the dance hall crashers had the most exciting female vocals in america?  back when tim armstrong from rancid wrote most of their first album?  <br />for god's sake, even team up with beastie boys for some help.
0783117523|5.0|I generally do not watch films such as this kind, but a friend offered it to me saying it was not like a porn movie or anything, but an intriguing film that makes you want to watch it over again and again.  It was truly a sensational film, though I had never heard of Gia Carangi.<br />It is a film in which starts Gia (Angelina Jolie) as a street/city girl who had no manners and worked for her father in a small restraunt.  She was later discovered and introduced to a woman who saw a future in her.  The hunch was right.  Though Gia was one extroverted character, which made her unfavorable to other models, she was daring and extravagant.  She was willing to try new things, and she was not afraid to what extent.  She soon became quite popular.<br />From her first shoot, she met the makup artists, in which she got an uneasy welcome.  But at that point, she met a person named Linda.  Linda was to be her savior.  Linda quickly learned how witty Gia was, not only when she heard Gia's quick retorts, but also when Gia asked her to pose with her in a nude protrait shoot with a photographer.  From this point onwards, feelings began to develop and so did Gia's career.<br />In the beginning, Linda resisted to Gia's seduction and tried to convince herself that she was straight.  Linda even retained a boyfriend, which infuriated Gia.  Gia then started goijng back to her old ways--drugs and guys, like she did when she first was living in the city.<br />Anyhow, I will not tell anymore, in fear that I may spoil the whole movie, but this is a film in which I would strongly recommend.  Though the genre may not be in the common mainstram, this film is metaphorical and can be related to many themes in life.  It can be mixed with fantasy vs. reality, in such that Gia was living in a fantasy, but ended becuae of reality.
B00008PW2D|3.0|Great Season but the price was WAY to MUCH for such a short season.
B0000024IE|5.0|This is an album that made me interested in rap music. Once in a while a truly unique expression presents itself in any music style. This represents some of the best that rap has to offer. Whether or not you agree with Chuck D's politics, you can't deny his flow, his message, and his voice inspired a slew of wannabes. and Terminator X was probrably the last great DJ; that is true turntable artist. This album delivers funky and hard joints like  <BR>911 is a joke and Fight the power anthems that are relevent a decade later and I feel this album remained strong where some of there previous releases were less so. For all you cats stuck on the 50 cent, Nelly, posthumorous Tupac, Jay-z albums, pick this cd up to hear a true innovator preach some real knowledge that goes way beyond dubs, pimps, hoes and gangsta. The soul of hip hop is captured on this album.
B00008H2LB|1.0|dumb gimmick,stupid lyrics,and music that starts at somthing only to go into american idol rediculousness.buy if you're another mtv robot.if not ,get any cd from bands like,Pantera,sepultura,Down,soulfly,angelo badalamenti,sigur ros,machine head,ect.see,there're too many good bands out there to waste your time on trendwhore bs like this.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is an EXCEPTIONAL piece of art; it maintains original storyline of the Broadway musical yet gives it a modern feel with these fresh, overly-talented actors &amp; if you can catch it, some sarcastic humor &amp; artistic vision &amp; metaphor!! I hardly ever agree with &quot;the Academy&quot;, so I didn't see this until my mom rented it, (before this my favorite musical was RockyHorror, so I'm not really what you'd call 'mainstream').  I was BLOWN AWAY! So, ok, great movie-making, but then to realize that the actors do all of their own singing &amp; dancing? It's amazing!<br />The storyline is: We open on prima-donna starlett Velma Kelly, (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who gives a whole new meaning to &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, she is supposed to be a sister act with Veronica who's missing at this point...in the audience is fresh-faced young Roxie Hart(Renee Zellweger), a girl with so many stars in her eyes she can't see reality and will do just about ANYTHING to ensure her place in Vaudeville. From this point its a fast-paced, intelligent, wryly humorous &amp; on-key ride as everyone attempts their proverbial 15 minutes (and hopefully more) of fame, no matter who gets shot in the process.  Velma is accustomed to being famous &amp; worshipped &amp; therefore getting her way, so she's a bit of a wench, whereas Roxie tries to catch the flies with honey &amp; is fairly naive, but as the story progresses, you see her learn quickly &amp; surpass others at getting AND KEEPING the attention. Billy Flynn,(Richard Gere),is the sly, sarcastic, silver-tongued lawyer hired to help the 2 girls...<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones has a musical &amp; theater background and it is very obvious as she showcases her many talents: she can sing, dance, act, acrobat, whatever. She's beautifully lethal, charming, and full of class, charisma &amp; hard work. Renee Zellweger, on the other hand had never sung or danced before, yet she plays with the best and DEFINITELY holds her own. She is VERYtalented &amp; its almost more endearing that this was her 1st venture into a musical-theatre-type of arena. No one can just be trained to sing that well, they merely work with what's already there....Richard Gere has never been one of my favorites but I now really respect and admire him, he is also full of talent and surprises.  Queen Latifah hits the screen and you know she's serious, seriously funny &amp; talented! Also a surprise cameo by Lucy Liu, it also has John C.Reilly, Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs &amp; popstar Mya.<br />One last point is this: These 3 stars, Catherine, Renee, &amp; Richard were big stars already and in their own right, this was not needed to push them in better, they did it because they rose to the challenge &amp; were perfectly cast. No one could have done better!  This is not just the movie of the year, but of the last few decades, not since Cabaret have I seen a musical put on film &amp; done right &amp; this one's better!! It deserved every acclaim it got--these people worked HARD...(I've seen it 100 times &amp; can't find 1 mistake). CHEERS!! Here's to Nowadays...enjoy it while it lasts cuz in 50 years or so it'll change, you know... :)
0316666343|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites! It's heart breaking yet full time for healing. As your reading it your guided by Susie Salmon who helps you see how her family, friends, and even her killer go through life on after her death and how she explores her new place, that so called &quot;Heaven&quot;. Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is written so wonderfully unique and very enjoying to read that it is now to be made into a motion picture movie and is to be directed by Lynne Ramsay (&quot;Raincatcher&quot; &amp; &quot;Morvern Cellar&quot;). I read the memoir &quot;Lucky&quot; and it was as best as &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;. I can't wait for the movie to come out, so I suggest that you read the book cause it's really no waste of time!
0446608955|5.0|The first time that I heard of this book is when i saw the preview for it on t.v. I was so excited to see it because it looked so good and everybody was talking about it. I saw the movie and thought that it was great, but then my sister was like well the book was so much better and it didn't really faze me because I didn't think that was even possible, so i didnlt read it. Then, i got into college reading and i decided to read the book and see if it was true. It was, I thought that the book was great! the book and the movie were completly different in so many ways. I think that this bool is good for all ages. I also think that this books message is to not take life for granted and actually give people a chance because everybody had certain qualities and something to offer, and you don't know what you will be missing when they are gone and you can't see them anymore. This book is a very good inspiration book, it makes you think about kids like Jamie at your own school, and makes you want to get to know them a little better and give them a try.
B000009CEM|5.0|This cd has stuff accessable for both the metal and nu-metal fans.The lyrics are exceptional-especially on &quot;timelessness&quot;.And I like Raymond's drums best on this album.If you like Slipknot,Machine Head,Pantera,Slayer,Sepultura,Metallica-anything heavy with a groove and brashly melodic-pick this up by all means.
B0000AXM3N|5.0|I'm the one of the biggest MJK fans you'll find.  I've bought every Tool CD.  I've bought both A Perfect Circle CDs... but I've only listened to one.<br />What's that... why haven't I listened to Thirteenth Step, even though I've paid hard earned money for it?  Well, I can't.  Physically.<br />EMI music was so nice as to include a &quot;bonus feature&quot; with Thirteenth Step.  Namely: copy-protection.<br />Or, more accurately: Listen-protection.  Of the 27 different CD playing devices that I own, not a single one will play the disc.  Except for maybe my PC, but only if I allow EMI to install some unknown propritary software that:<BR>a) I have no idea what it is, or what it will do to my computer<BR>b) Has the ability to collect and send personal data<BR>c) Has a VERY binding End User License Agreement.<br />So, I'd love to say that the CD is great, and that I've listened to it over and over... but I'd be lying.<br />Buyer Beware!  If the copy of &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; you are thinking of buying features &quot;copy protection&quot;, avoid it like the plague.  Let EMI know that you would like a working copy of the CD instead.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This cd has everything headbangers crave-speed,intelligent lyrics,and perfectly timed drums.This is a short review,but if you like real metal(unlike staind,linkin park,puddle of mudd,etc.-aka nu-metal)you've probably either already got it,or need to get it!I'll let most of the other reviews speak for me,but anyone not giving this album 5 stars is probably one of those self proclaimed &quot;metal professors&quot;,or just too rediculously trendy to accept Slayer for what they are-speed metal perfection  .
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Now, I think The Strokes are a great band, but the songs on this album aren't so great. There ARE some good ones, though, like \\"12:51\\". Other good tracks are the ones that kind of sound like old-school soul songs, like \\"Between Love &amp; Hate\\" and \\"Under Control\\".<br />But then there are some songs that I could do without, like \\"The End Has No End\\", \\"The Way It Is\\", and especially \\"You Talk Way Too Much\\". Speaking of talking, Jules once said in an interview that he usually doesn't write the lyrics until after the music is done. Maybe that's evident here, because you can hardly hear what he's saying in most of these songs.<br />It's also not a good idea to have a bunch of mostly okay songs on an album that's only 33 minutes long. If you want to REALLY feel music like this, pick up their first album (or possibly Jet's Get Born) instead.<br />Anthony Rupert

1563894696|2.0|This book was a real let down. My interest in this title was generated based on the great reviews The Long Halloween recieved (on Amazon and elswhere). When the comparrisons to Frank Miller's seminal work on Batman was made by some, I was sold. Oh my, was i ever shocked upon actually reading it. This is why I'm sending out a warning out to those expecting Miller calibur writing in this title: Don't! This doen't even come close. In fact, The Long Halloween is actually not very good at all.<BR>    Here's my main complaint: Incridebly contrived and poorly executed &quot;mystery.&quot; One should not be left severely confused after the story and mystery is resolved, and as hard as I tied to figure it out, I was continually perplexed by The Long Halloween. I reread it two times trying to make some sense of it, but still the pieces didn't fit together. Well, at least in any manner that was not extremely convoluted, arbitrary, and well, unbelivable. The &quot;twists&quot; at the end just didn't add up. I attribute this to very poor characterization and pacing, and motivations and allegiences that are never clearly explained, even after the story's punchline. I really can't understand why some people would compare The Long Halloween to Frank Miller's work, it's totally overrated.                                                           Pretty art though, and at least the follow up, Dark Victory, was a bit of an improvement.
B00006RU5B|1.0|NOT!this stuff is even worse than rage against the machine.&quot;they've really 'grown up'with this album&quot;-how can any intelligent human utter such doofus-like sayings?Go get Soulfy's self titled cd,Down-a bustle in your hedgerow,corrosion of conformity,Pantera-vulgar display of power,or Sepultura-roots,and lose the mainstream dunce cap buddy.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie is Bloody Brilliant!<BR>I was a Harry Potter fan the second I picked up the first book, which was when it came out.  And I have thouroghly enjoyed reading all these brilliant books.  If you are a Harry Potter fan I know you will enjoy the first movie.  It has everything a movie needs.  Suspense, Drama, Fantasy, Courage, a Hero and a Villan, love, loyalty and betrayal.  Being after the book it just had to be good.  There are a few parts I wish they hadn't taken out but all in all it was wicked.  I would recommend reading the books before you see the movies, I enjoyed very much comparing the Book and the Movie with my friends.  Being 15 you would think that maybe I might of outgrown Wizards and castles, at least thats what everyone else thinks...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO WAY! See this movie I know you'll think it's Wicked also!
B000002U9Y|5.0|It's creepy. This is one trippy album. Syd signs off. Literal. Pay attention to the lyrics. I find lyrics to be the least important part of a song. The voice is primarily another instrument. But every now and then a worthwhile piece of lyricism comes about, as in Jugband Blues. Syd knew his role as Kind Floyd was coming to an end. Why not mark the occasion with, hmmmmmm, a salvation army band, and tell them \\"play whatever you want.\\" Only Syd could pull this off. Brilliant.<br />As for the rest of the album, See Saw is one of my favorites in the entire Floyd catalog. Great job, Rick, don't be so hard on yorself, both of your songs on here are beautiful. Are those strings I hear? Its a song about doing drugs. Unlike drugs, all of life's problems go away with this. It's heroin for the soul. <BR>oooooh, it sooooooths me... Sweet, Sweet melody.<br />The title track is one of the strongest musical pieces ever done by PF. Wins award for best song in the categories \\"best example of how to drive your record's producer bonkers/getting the biggest bang out of only 4 tracks/total exploitation of a sound engineer.\\" Mommy, make it stop! I don't know what it is, but it just SOUNDS right. Melt, mind, melt...<br />Clegg. A rare bit of humor. The kazoo is great. It works. It is the main charachter of the song. A military march to war, headed by the dumbest musical instrument, the kazoo. Even you can play one. And bombs exploding and air raid sirens. And sub mongoloid lyrics. They can be just as effective as profound lyrics. Even better. Floyd's must fun song. Roger, you may remove the tongue from your cheek.<br />More Light. Heavy. This is what heavy is. So dark, get it. The incomprehensible heaviness of light... nuts <br />Remember. Manic depressive at its best. Playfuly melodic in a depressing way. Cool ch-ch's... Syd?<br />Set Controls. Has a very trance like effect. Always envisioned peering into a fire. The buttons are very bitter and must be chewed. The room must be dark or itis not the same. The vibes are great. So is the vibe you get .<br />Yeah the production is not the best. I like to see what a band <BR>can do without a budget that exceeds the gross national product of Argentina. Floyd's got it, Syd or no Syd. Even Mr. Negative himself, one R. Waters, agrees.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie is even more wicked than the first.  If you've read the books and seen the first movie you just gotta' see the second movie.  The special effects are amazing and have improved a little since the first movie.  This movie is a WHOLE lot more intense then the first.  Since there's a big tree who beats up a car for being banged into, a Dueling club, Giant spiders, and a HUMONGOUS serpent that tries to eat Harry alive you would expect that it would be, maybe just a little, more intense then the first.  I was definatly glued after the first 10 seconds into the movie, and I seriously don't think I blinked through the whole thing. You just gotta see this movie, (SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: It is Highly recommended that you get some eye drops to use after the movie as they may shrivle up and pop right out of you're head from dehydration).  I'm glued, and I know you will be to if you see this movie.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|The wait for Sarah McLachlan's latest release is over. Although her heavenly album, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,&quot; is considered the gold standard, there are a few tracks on this album that are good. As a fan before Fumbling, her sound and lyrics morph and shape themselves by (what it seems) her life experiences like any other artist. This is no different. Sparse and simple, this album has a &quot;take it or leave it&quot;-as-it-is approach. Not entirely bad or entirely great, but worth a spot in your CD collection.
B00006879E|5.0|I must admit, when I first heard the &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; single on the radio, I thought this group was another alternative &quot;screaming into the microphone&quot; group. I'm 18 years old, and do like music that actually has a beat to it.<BR>What possessed me to buy this album? Not necessarily the hype (if there was any, I was oblivious to it) I wanted to try something new. As some people &quot;try something new&quot; by going to a Sushi Bar, I went to the closest entertainment store and picked up this CD for a mere $10. I didn't think anything of it. Sure, a cheap CD, why not? I should've taken notice that the cashier told me that the copy I purchased was the last remaining one in the store.<BR>Now, I'm like most folks that just buy a CD for one song and never listen to the rest of it, however, as I said before, I didn't buy this CD for the &quot;hit single&quot; In some ways, &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot; irritated me.<BR>This is one of those cases where I just shrugged my shoulders and took the plunge. If this CD was $100 or 1 penny it would still be a good buy. Since I bought this CD less than 24 hours ago it's been going on repeat the entire time. I strongly suggest anybody pick up this album because unlike other bands that repeat the same style over and over again and have tiresome beats or rhythms on every track, Maroon 5 can definitely stretch. Don't let the almost gothic-like cover discourage you. It's like seeing a shadow in an alley that's huge and hearing strange noises, only to find out it's a kitten. True, Maroon 5 isn't THIS innocent, but believe me, these songs are distinguished and catchy. Well, the initial point I'm getting at is this album is for anyone much like Monopoly. It doesn't matter, this album is just plain good music.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Although not a huge Tool fan, I have heard enough of them to be able to compare Tool to A Perfect Circle. Between the two, 13th Step is one step more progressive than the trend Tool has already established. Nonetheless, the results are the same. This is truely an amazing music expierience. To know its full value, I recommend listening to the entire album straight, feeling the various emotions flowing throughout until finally reaching an euphoric, hypnotic state. Hardcore Tool fans will enjoy &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; and &quot;The Outsider&quot;, as these are the hardest tracks on the album, however &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; define a new progressive extreme for our generation that will go unmatched. Fans searching for an outlet to today's popular music will lavish in this album. Maynard countinues to establish himself as one of the top lyricists in our generation. Without question this album is a five, and should be owned by all true music fans.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Im a fan of 1&amp;2 and this really really let me down. Kristanna Loken as the villan T-X was great. She did an amazing job but the T-100 (Arnold) has way to much personality, he has feelings and he second guesses himself now. What made him cool in the first place was that he had no feelings or remorse, he was just a bad azz killing machine. Clair Danes??...c-mon, whose idea was that??  John Conner NEEDED to be played by Edward Furlong. The T-100 also knew too much this time around, this is a different T-100 than the one from T2, so how did he know to look above the sun visor for the car keys? You can look forward to a major rehash of every funny part of T2, except it isnt funny this time around. This story is terrible...a huge let down. Im a HUGE fan of the first two and I waited on pins and needles for over 10 years before they FINALLY released the 3rd one....Im sad to say that they shouldnt have even made it. Its a sorry sorry movie. There is only one reason to watch this...Kristanna Loken!  To finish this up,  this movie was not made to satisfy the fans, its just a guaranteed money maker from Hollywood. Thanks for throwing T-3 in the garbage Jonathan Mostow, it could have been great. If you dont already have T2, buy it instead, its MUCH better and thats almost unarguable. The special effects of T2 still hold up to todays standards too.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Wow! What a great film!<br />I hate to say this about a film that I have just seen but I feel I must be honest here: Big Fish was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story, acting, romance, humor and visuals are all excellent. Tim Burton has made a truly beautiful film that is warm, intelligent and amusing. Ewan McGregor has really created a wonderful and entertaining character that is really truly endearing to the audience. You really care about what he is doing and what he is going through when he experiences all of his adventures.<br />Tim Burton is able to truly create a film for the whole family that isn't sappy or cheesy. He has also created a movie that is very deep and thought-provoking.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Gosh I don't even have the cd yet but just looking at this cast I am blown away!  (I'm assured I'll rate it a 5) I loved Idina in Rent and am so happy she is finally in another show!  And I also love Norbert Leo Butz!  He was AMAZING in The Last Five Years, and I've been waiting for him to appear in something new.  Even if it is one song!  I let you know how good the cd is after I buy it tomorrow...
B000063UR2|3.0|Ok I love this movie and I guess I look at in in 3 ways<BR>1. story<BR>2. scenery<BR>3. Music<br />Ive only known the Tangerine Dream soundtrack version and while I love the additional footage I find the new soundtrack to feel out of place and poorly mixed ( bad scene cuts and over bearing in spots ) dont get me wrong it does sound good but strange to someone as familar with the film as I am. The story is good fantasy on both versions as is the scenery, On the scene where Lily first makes an entrance the flowers in the meadow totally stand out, absolutly gorgeous and The evil tree rocks!<BR>My only real problem is that we get stuck with the less than ultimate sound treatment on the Tangerine dream soundtrack I mean come on this was made to be 5.1! Good work on the marketers as you know they will re-release the theater version in the future with the upgrade so you can buy it again. the hard part about reveiwing nowadays is the fact that this is only 15 bucks which I would have paid for just the widescreen version of the normal release even with the dolby stereo :)
0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown, the author, has stolen most of his material from others and has tried to pawn it off as unique. Oh jeez, the writing is sub-par and the content is shallow. If you buy this book, I assure you that you will be disappointed with what you get. The book received a great deal of hype -- but, so did O.J. Simpson's trial. Try another title, like The Tale of the Devil: The Biography of Devil Anse Hatfield, or West Virginia Tough Boys. Shoot, try &quot;I'm A Soldier, Too!&quot; Anything would be better that this hard-bound dissapointment. Ugh.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow, I'm stunned.  I now understand why my friends constantly ranted about Fox canceling 'some show called Firefly'.  It's truly excellent acting and writing.  My hat off to the cast.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I find it ironic how many, if all, of the 1 star reviews complain about how each song is &quot;identical&quot; or the album being &quot;too long.&quot;  I don't know anyone who would like less of something that is good.  Those of you saying that each song is identical most likely never have even listened to this cd because the songs each have a different, unique style to them.  These people who are rating them 1 star are probably people just here to bash this cd because they hate Miss Aguilera or are either fans of the talented stripped, Miss Spear.  It's sad because they'll never be able to get a chance to see how real music should sound like.  I will admit, when she came out with the single Dirty, I was so turned off by her image (though I did like the song), I swore I'd never get the cd. After reading all the reviews here, all hyped up and so many glowing reviews, I went out and bought it on a whim.  When I listened to it, I thought, what the heck is all the hype about?!  After a few listens, it has grown on me and to my surprise, my sisters as well, who were Xtina bashers until now.  Lets just say, we love it so much, we have a cd in the car, stereo in the bathroom, one in each room and the list goes on.  <br />Anyhow, my favorite song on this album is Walk Away because I can relate to it and I'm sure everyone can (not just in a relationship kind of way either).  All the songs are good, except for Makeover and Keep on Singing My Song, but that's just my preference.  <br />You should get this cd and give it a try, you won't regret it, I sure didn't.
B00009PN9D|5.0|While this band may not have the most unique sound they are a breath of fresh air.  Definately one of the best rock records I've heard in years.  If you are now or have ever been a fan of 80's rock (the good stuff, like The Cars, The Cure, The Police, Joy Division, etc...) then you'll love this album.  Buy it and be very impressed.
6305364613|1.0|This movie was shown to our english honors class to understand the the play better. It was kinda funny because we had also read the play and i think to movie made the really good play into something horrible. It was so cheesy that the plotted jokes in the movie were an insult to humanity. But it was kinda funny to see people with pink hair and in the setting of mafia criminal areas in old time Shakesperian language. Pink hair, gun fights, hip hop cross dressers don't match with Shakespeare. Its supposed to be about sword fights bad acting and the old time knight of the round table like stuff not gangs warlords and drugs. The drugs back then was cheap wine and really smelly cheese. The \\"Queen of Mab Speech\\" with the black guy \\"trippin' on E\\" and in a dress was utterly horrifying. Poor William Shakespeare probablly rolled over in his grave at the turn out and the unsuccess of the movie. Whoever directed this movie Shakespeare will come back and crucify you and burn down your village and shame your ancestors. Remember the term \\"Bitting thumbs\\". Its another old way of giving the middle finger. I bet shakespeare is in his grave bitting his thumb at the director, screen writer and Leo Decaperio. Mwhahaha may he have mercey on souls.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Like a pair of old jeans, Norah Jones just makes you feel at home. Although she's signed to a jazz label, NJ is more Joni Mitchell than Nina Simone, and her voice, though raw and young, has a rich, refreshing honesty that seduces purely with its simplicity and lack of pretention. Her piano playing is unassuming and tasteful, and seems content with its supporting role in the ensemble. While Jones's own songwriting has yet to reach the same level as the rest of the album (and most noticeably, that of her guitarist, Jesse Harris and bassist Lee Alexander), she successfully navigates a warm and relaxed set, perfect for late night listening.
B00004W52U|5.0|This CD is the best cd I have ever heard. Operation Ivy was in my opinion the perfect blend of ska and punk. If you don't know of them, pick this up, but of course, why should I write this when everyone has already heard enough reviews to get the picture? To defend it, because I read a review saying it sucked. Now, listen up.<br />Yes, the recording quality wasn't great, but you can hear every chord, every rythem, every word. This was Lookout's first record, and it was in 89, and I'm sure they wern't running on much cash back then in Berkely, so of course its going to sound bad in quality.<br />But you're missing the point. I would think that especially a &quot;punk rocker&quot; would know that an album doesn't need to be recorded well to be great. A &quot;punk&quot; especially should care more about the passion then the money spent.<br />The fact remains that there is no cd or record out there with more passion, energy, and intelligence.<br />The music is politically brilliant, and if you don't think so, you're a skinhead or stupid enough that you shouldn't be allowed to judge something on its politics.<br />Lint(Tim Armstrong) played a catchier guitar than any punk or ska guitarist I've ever heard. Matt McCall(Freeman) is the best punk bassiest alive, and Jesse had a completely unique voice. Dave Mello played incredibly, considering he had never played drums before being in this band.<br />So, to finish up, if you can't at least appriate Op Ivy, you probably havn't heard them. A real punk would at least respect the spirit.<br />By the way, this is all aimed at the guy who gave this a 1.
0151008116|5.0|Pi, a young anxious boy, is abandoned in a tiny life-boat on the very wide ocean together with an enormous tiger and other animals after a shipwreck, eventually he learns how to master the danger, to tangle with reality and finally how to save his own Life and become un adult. It's very English in style, humour and vocabulary. Among the very best. Doesn't it remind you of Lewis Carrol and &quot;Alice in the Wonderland&quot; ??<BR>I'll certainly read it again.
0780626966|5.0|I bought this set in August 2003...I saw the Freddy vs. Jason movie and I was completely obsessed with NOES stuff. I looked online and found this DVD set and had to get it. What a great deal it is and it has cool extras on the 8th disc. I hadn't watched many of these movies for years and I remembered now how much of a Freddy fan I am. I even joined the Englundlist on Yahoo and checked out the RobertEnglund.com website. Woohoo!! I totally think Robert is a wonderful actor and not just as Freddy but in all the movies he was in. A must have set for any fan!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This was an great story and it was backed with special Effects that was not over played. The thing that made this movie stand from The Matrix was the special effects accaully. This movie was not over played with two hours of bullet time or panscan (the effects where the fighters jump up and freeze in the action)  fight sequences. There was alot of slow motion fights though(not the same as panscan).The story line drove this movie quite nicely. The story line is not good vs. evil but evil vs. evil. This movie was filled with alot of curve balls but some parts where predictable also. This was still an entertaining movie and one of the best films,in my opinion, of 2003. The start of the movie starts with in your face action which pulled me in from the start. The action is great and only stops for a little bit to make the story line cohesive. <BR>       The special effects  of the transformation of the wherewolves where well done and not over blown. The vampires did not have much to change but I felt that it was good enough for the feel of the movie.<br />In Short:<BR>This is a film for more of the &quot;Goth Thriller Action&quot; fans. I loved it and thought it to be pretty original in its own right.<br />People who may enjoy this movie:<BR>People who like The Crow, Blade, Spawn (Todd McFarland), and maybe some Matrix fans.

B000002NJS|5.0|It seems this is Madonna's last great album, well to me at least. On 2000's MUSIC she stumbled, and 2003's AMERICAN LIFE she plummeted even further into the abyss. On 1998, she seems more focused than ever before on her music, which is more than I can say about her newer stuff. This was one of the best era's of her career, she truly made a huge comeback and impact with this album. A lot happened between 1994's BEDTIME STORIES and the release of this album in March of 1998. She starred as Evita Peron in EVITA in 1996, and gave birth to daughter Lourdes in the same year. Did motherhood change Madonna? Yes it did.<br />Working with producer William Orbit, the album has a sonically sweet sound that borrows heavily from electronica without overshadowing the poignant impact of the lyrics. She sings about how she's changed on &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, and others. &quot;Swim&quot; seems to be an epiphany about how she longs to be renewed and whole again. She sings of motherhood on the lullaby-ish &quot;Little Star&quot;. She tackles past demons about her own mother on &quot;Mer Girl&quot;, which is haunting and graphic. &quot;To Have And Not To Hold&quot; is an excellent ballad, as is &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot;. Overall a strong collection of songs from the material mom.

B000002LND|5.0|This is the one Madonna album to own if you just had to have one. This is the soundtrack to the 80s! All of her big hits in one package, what more could you want? There's also two new songs, the saucy &quot;Justify My Love&quot; (which was written by Lenny Kravitz), and the frantic &quot;Rescue Me&quot;. A lot of the songs are different versions, like the single versions. From her earliest hit &quot;Holiday&quot; to 1990's &quot;Vogue&quot;, and everything in between. This album has it all. These songs define Madonna's early career, and capture the fun and exuberance of that period. Who could forget classics like &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, or &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;? They are all here, and many more. Forget essential to every Madonna collection, essential to every music collection.
B00003BDXG|3.0|Before seeing Natural Born Killers everyone's heard the hype behind the violence of the movie, so going into it you've already got your preconceptions.  Stone sets up a nightmarish blurring between the world of the media and reality, using various images such as black and white, colour, cartoon and sitcom pastiches to tell the story of killers on the run and in love Mickey (Harrelson) and Mallory (Lewis).  NBK charts their ascent into celebrity which reaches fever pitch once they're captured thanks to Robert Downey Jnr's TV presenter whipping up a media frenzy.<br />You'd think that the movie had a lot to say given the ambitions it sets, but in fact it seems to just stage a hate campaign against the media.  Admitedly, the visuals with which it does so are impressive and interesting but, especially in the early stages, can distract from the overall film.  One thing I did like in particular though was the 'I Love Mallory' show, a satire depicting Mallory's abusive childhood and her subsequent rescue by Mickey.  This, and Downey Jnr. dressed as the devil dripping with blood, are some of things to truly savour from the movie.  The performances too, are all well-judged.  Harrelson and Lewis play the oddball, murderous love birds to perfection and Downey Jnr. continues to impress in every role he's in.<br />Unfortunately, it's all too easy to compare NBK to any number of other movies, most of which make it seem a pale imitator.  It fails to evoke the sympathy for its protagonists that Bonnie and Clyde did and compared to the more masterful Man Bites Dog, its satirisation of how media encourages violence comes across as amateurish rather than astute.  Quentin Tarantino apparently disowned the movie after Stone's reworking, and it's not hard to see why.  Whilst it's certainly memorable, it seems to strive for the kinetic energy that made Pulp Fiction, True Romance (and latterly Kill Bill Vol. 1) tick and fall flat on its face.  Interestingly, it's actually not as violent asit has been reputed and shouldn't be condemned on those grounds.  Certainly, NBK has its moments and it's an enjoable film as a whole, but it's far from perfect and one of the least distinguished movie to bear Tarantino's stamp on it.
B00005Q66T|3.0|Madonna's second GH collection....titled GHV2...a collection of her 90s hits. The one positive thing I can think of is, at least we have them all on one CD. However I have to wonder what the point was...oh yeah wait it was so Madonna could milk her fans for more money. To be honest, if you have all her 90s albums, you don't need this collection, unless you are some diehard who has to own everything Madonna. Otherwise it's a waste. Most of the songs are edits anyway, not even the originals. It's an interesting collection, but I say if you're a casual fan this is for you, if you have her albums then don't bother.
B00003CXSP|3.0|The escaped Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) once again contacts Agent Starling (Julianne Moore), who has come under public scrutiny after an FBI operation gone bad.  This opens up a new opportunity to catch Dr. Lecter for those who seek to catch him.  Hannibal is a suspenseful thriller with some gruesome scenes that will remind the audience of Hannibal's psychological state long after they have seen the film.  In addition, Hopkins offers a solid performance as Hannibal once again, but this sequel does not measure up with the original Silence of the Lambs.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Phillip Noyce is mostly known for his action/suspense films such as Dead Calm (1989) and The Saint (1997).  However, in this production he is outdoing himself with a vibrant survival story about the journey of three young back to their home from which they have been taken due to Australia's policy in regards to aborigines.  Rabbit-Proof Fence provides a great opportunity to visually experience the girls struggle to reach their goal to get home.  This struggle elevates the meaning of hope in our world.  In short, the story itself offers a brilliant cinematic experience with Kenneth Branagh as A. O. Neville enhancing the overall experience as well.
6305508550|5.0|Sooner or later, most of us--if we're the slightest bit perceptive--will realize that most of our lives are dedicated to moving grains of sand from one pile to another.  And then back again.  We do it as we get older and older, and then we develop heart disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc., and then die. And we've done a wonderful job of creating ornate illusions to make us think that we're doing something important, or at least worthwhile.<br />Office Space takes a nice poke at this illusion of meaning, as a modern day hero, with the help of a dying hypnotist, suddenly decides he just doesn't want to do anything.  And that he's thrilled to do nothing.  It makes him whole.  Complete.  Satisfied.  Of course, the last thing our culture wants is for someone to discover the joy of not keeping busy.  Busy work is the essence of our social order.<br />So, our hero stops taking life seriously, and wondrous riches, of sorts, land in his lap.  Can a person be happy without mindless, meaningless routine?<br />Why aren't there more movies like this?
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Congratulations, Stephen Schwartz.  You've written a wonderful score with witty, intelligent lyrics.  I've seen the show, and some of the music flew by me a bit too quickly (I loved it nonetheless).  What a pleasure, then, to be able to listen to the songs (over and over!) while reading the lyrics in the CD's booklet.  Lovely melodies.  This is my new obsession.  &quot;I think I'll try defying gravity...&quot;
B00001U03Q|1.0|It's hard to believe that the blues purist that walked away from the Yardbirds is the same guy responsible for this garbage.  Still coasting on the &quot;God&quot; reputation of the Cream days, E.C. has been turning out this boring, over-produced swill for two decades now.  The fact that he's an undeniably gifted guitarist does nothing to salvage his recent output.  The man has lost it, in short.  Listen instead to his Yardbirds and Bluesbreakers work, and sigh over what might have been.
B00005JL78|4.0|The first collaboration between superstar actor Tom Cruise and famed director Steven Spielberg seems to be a film of redemption. Both had trouble with their last picture with Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky not meeting expectations and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence tanking after a decent opening weekend. Whether this is the case or not, both Spielberg and Cruise had read the short story by Phillip K. Dick and did everything in their power to bring the story to life on the big screen. With such a stellar combination and huge marketing buzz to boast, can anything stop this film from breaking the box office bank? How about a little alien? Surprisingly Spielberg and Cruise's dream child may get upset by a genre of film many believed to be on the oust but only long-term time will tell. For now, Minority Report goes head to head with Disney's Lilo & Stitch in a weekend period many thought would be the calm before the Independence Day storm.<br />The story centers on a man who works for the division of pre-crime for the city of Washington D.C. The division of pre-crime is centered on the visions of the three Pre-Cogs, psychics of sorts that predict murders before they take place. It is up to the cop-like pre-crime division team led by Detective John Anderton to stop these acts before the present catches up with the future. And so far it has proven its worth with the absence of murderous acts in the nation's capitol for over six years. But when a hot shot federal agent comes in to take control of the pre-crime department at a time when the nation will vote on whether pre-crime should be allowed, Detective Anderton begins to notice flaws in the system. When he seen in a vision murdering a man he had never met before, he must find a way to change his future in less then 36 hours. The story for Minority Report is probably one of the best that has come from Hollywood in quite some time and we wouldn't expect less from Steven Spielberg. The plot is very intelligent and proves that the summer doesn't have to be just brain-dead, blow `em up action flicks. The biggest surprise comes from the balanced flow of the film considering this was based on a short story.<br />The cast for Minority Report is put together exceedingly well. Tom Cruise has what could be another Oscar worthy performance as Detective John Anderton. Will he get nominated? Not likely since the movie is opening too far ahead of the nominating process but it doesn't he can't be recognized for it. Cruise expresses a wide range of emotions throughout the picture and fits perfectly into the role. Colin Farrell does a pretty good job in the role of Detective Ed Witwer. The only problem is the way his character is killed off near the end of the picture. It is kind of insulting to the character but this isn't a complaint towards Farrell's performance, just toward the story. And Max Von Sydow gives an absolutely wonderful performance as Director Burgess and works well with Tom Cruise all the way to the very end.<br />Overall, Minority Report keeps the audience guessing and running out breath all the way to the very end. The film is definitely the best suspense thriller in summer 2002 if not the best film of the year. Spielberg truly makes up for the mistakes he made in A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Tom Cruise proves to many disbelievers that he can take on such a difficult project with one of the best directors of all time. Though the film is well put together, there are some things to pick at. That would include the film's 2 hour and 25 minute time length, which seemed too long. Portions of the film seemed to really drag especially as the picture neared the end and could have been cut. Another complaint doesn't exactly involve anything that could have been done but the whole thing with Tom Cruise's eyes seemed too much at times. Some of the jokes involving the eyes got a little annoying and could have been left out of the final print. In the end, though, Minority Reportachieves everything it was meant to and more. This could definitely be one of the more mature films of the year and works exceedingly well with that.

Obviously, my life has changed in oh so many ways (as has the world in general), but I still find myself playing at least one song from this album on a weekly basis.

B00005JMTN|4.0|\\"There are some fish that can't be caught. It's not that they're bigger or faster then the other fish, they're just touched by something extra.\\"<br />Does Columbia enjoy sitting on their butts while the other studios gather Oscar praise? They started 2003 off not so promisingly with Darkness Falls and Tears of the Sun while limping through the summer with sub par hits like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bad Boys II. Is it that they have no more ambition left in them to put forth the effort? Was it the tremendous embarrassment of Gigli that is the true cause for their lack of marketing strength? If so then that is too bad. No, not because of real Oscar hope for Mona Lisa Smile (Julia Roberts doesn't need another Oscar statue) or Something's Gotta Give is gone but the fact that the studio may have had a real chance with Tim Burton's big screen adaptation of a not so well known tale, Big Fish. It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest. Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart-felt tale to the screen with his track-record of weird projects but the way Columbia is looking for Oscar night at this point, it could hurt to find out.<br />Big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall-tales. Edward Bloom was too big for the small town he grew up in. That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it. William Bloom never really knew his father. Edward was either off on business trips or telling the same elaborate fantasies that his son had heard his entire life, more then once or twice. After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon. The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was. Going through all the magical and extraordinary adventures once again, William discovers that the truth of his father was there all along, he just needed to know where to look. The story for Big Fish takes several different and elaborate stories, some that work and some that don't, and brings them together in an enjoyable heart warming feature. At times, Fish's plot seems too high for its own good and the huge elaboration of simple stories seem way over done for many to take seriously within the context of what the filmmakers are trying to get across. This leads for some scenes within the film to not come off as effectively as others. Luckily this doesn't happen too often with the course of the film.<br />The cast consists of only two main leads (three if you count two people for the same role in different time periods) but the supporting roles provided by various talented actors and actresses are nearly as entertaining. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney share the role of Edward Bloom in various part of his life, the latter actor portraying the character as a dying old man. Finney's performance is nothing short of spectacular as Edward Bloom deteriorates as the feature moves on and as he struggles to get his son to understand the meaning behind his tall-tales. The last scene involving Finney will have anyone reaching for a tissue. That is a guarantee. McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating. Billy Crudup, who portrays William Bloom, seems okay but there is nothing in his performance that really stands out or equals that of Finney's performance along side him. Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring-leader who eventually hires Bloom to work on his show. Despite this charming performance, be warned! Unless you want horrible images of Mr. DeVito's rear end embedded in your mind, best to keep your eyes shut during a certain portion of the film. Nothing extraordinarily long but long enough. And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.<br />Overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high-watered ambition despite a flop or two too close to shore. Going into this film, one has to understand this: almost everything in the individual tales is a metaphor for something else. The conjoined Japanese twins, for example, aren't actually conjoined in real life but they are so connected to each other, despite their own personal differences, that it seems that way. Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do. The most prominent moment(s) involves the naked woman in the river that the young Edward Bloom sees outside his car that has been submerged by a great rainstorm. Of all the other fantasy sequences, this is the one that made the least amount of sense and probably wasn't necessary. Even with a pretty well balanced two hour time length, Big Fish fluxes between consistency and incoherence with some tales struggling to keep the pace more then others. Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice. It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Star Trek VI is my third-favorite of all the films, right behind The Wrath of Khan and First Contact. This movie once again examined current events through the scope of Gene Roddenberry's universe; it contained great space opera, plenty of intrigue, a decidedly melodramatic villain, and some genuine thrills. This is Star Trek at its best: bold, relevant and decidedly optimistic.<br />The plot for this installment closely parallels the political climate of the early 90s. The hostility between the Klingon Empire and the Federation is over due to a disaster on a key Klingon moon. The Federation and Klingons decide to try to settle their differences diplomatically, and Captain Kirk (William Shatner) is selected to escort the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (the wonderful David Warner) and his staff, including the prickly General Chang (a similarly excellent Christopher Plummer). All hell breaks loose after an attack on the Klingon Flagship leaves Gowron dead and Kirk and McCoy (DeForrest Kelley) charged with the crime. They must escape from prison and piece together who was behind the attack, as well as prevent the killer from striking again. The leads are wonderful here, including all the original series crew, a pre-Sex and the City Kim Catrall, and especially Warner and Plummer, who both bring their Shakespeare roots to make this perhaps the most literate Trek movie.<br />The conflicts here are palpable and help to make the movie so interesting. Spock with his Vulcan protege who turns out to be a turncoat, Kirk has to grapple with his racism toward Klingons which mirrors the conflict between the two empires. Director Meyer once again proves his ability to create ascending tension in his work. The final scene with Kirk's speech is a powerful one. This is, in many ways, the most epic Trek film.<br />This DVD ought to be worth it for the Trek fan. I'm sure Nicholas Meyer will do the commentary for this movie, which should be great. Meyer's commentary for The Wrath of Khan wasinspired, full of interesting trivia, and Meyer himself came off as intelligent and creative. I'm sure looking forward to it.
B00008DDXC|4.0|The magical world of Harry Potter is revisited with the second film in the series that digs deeper into mysteries of the wizard world. The original film, Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone, was met with huge hype and an enormous response from the movie-going public. The film broke almost every box office record in the book. Unfortunately those records didn't last long as they were quickly broken by the release of Spider-Man in May 2002. But could The Chamber of Secrets offer a threat to the famous web slinger? Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets hopes to follow in the foot steps of the original though it appears to be much darker then the first film. Hopes are that many of the fans won't be alienated by the change. But the question is whether the film can hold up better the original or will it show that the original was just a mere fluke and change is not good for the series?<br />The story focuses on Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the problems that ensue around the young wizard. Harry Potter has been spending the summer at his uncle and aunt's house and desires to return back to the school with his friends. But that may not be so easy. Apparently a house elf named Dobby has reason to believe that great danger will fall upon Mr. Potter if he returns, so he does everything he can to prevent Potter from returning to Hogwarts. When he is able to make it back to his school, strange things start happening. Harry begins to hear voices in the empty hallways, water begins flooding the halls, and Harry is able to communicate with snakes. Not only that but people have been found petrified and a rumor is spreading that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened once again. It is up to Harry and his group of friends to protect Hogwarts from impending danger within the school itself. The story for The Chamber of Secrets is much darker then the original Harry Potter but that is what makes it great. The darkness of the plot shows that the film makers are willing to make their films more mature as their audience gets older. The plot keeps the audience interested in every aspect of the movie despite the long time length.<br />A good amount of the cast from Harry Potter &amp; the Sorcerer's Stone reprise their roles in the second film. The acting within the film was much better then in the original film as many of the cast members have grown more into their roles and feel more comfortable, which is quite evident within the film. Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry Potter and once again he is fabulous in the role. He showcases a broad range of emotions within the film which is rarely seen in a film intended for children and does a much better job at showcasing his acting talent then he did in the original. Richard Harris, in his last major role in a motion picture, is wonderful once again as Professor Dumbledore. Harris is one of the greatest British actors that have ever appeared on screen and it is wonderful to see him go out in such a great way as in this role. There are too many roles within this film to mention each by name but the cast is very well put together and there were very few problems. The only problem was the character of Ronald Weasley. There was no problem with the person who played him but actions of the character itself. In the original film Ronald was sort of mixed character having both comic moments as well as serious ones but he has now been reduced to a comedic character, which is quite disappointing.<br />Overall, Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best movies of the year and goes beyond the expectations of a normal sequel. The magical world of Harry Potter is brought back to life better then ever before. Though the film is much darker then the original, that does seem to affect the overall effect of the series. The darker moments actually make the film feel more exciting and make the audience feel more connected to the characters and what happens tothem. The film definitely matures with the audience the Harry Potter series seems to connect to but doesn't do so in such a dramatic way that some fans are alienated by rapid change. Though the film is near perfection, there are flaws to it. The running time of the picture, which stands at an amazing two hours and forty minutes, seems too long for a film intended for children though it did help tell the story better then if it had been edited down to a shorter time length. There were many amazing CG special effect sequences but not all the CGI was greatly appreciated. The character of Dobby the house elf is sure to be added to the most annoying CG character list for this year. He seemed fine for the plot of the film but for the most part, he was too annoying and distracting for the purpose of the story. Other then those problems, Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets definitely raises the bar not only for children films but for sequels as well. This film is a delightful film for all ages, though some precaution may be needed for the younger fans of Harry Potter as the film has several frightening moments. One of the few films out there that truly lives up to all the hype of the original and even goes beyond expectations.
B00005JM02|4.0|My grandkids love it. I love most of the Disney films, but this one left me yawning.
B00005JKN9|3.0|The idea for Gangs of New York, a film about the oppression of the Irish immigrants in 1860's America, had been floating around the head of Martin Scorsese for nearly thirty years and after continuous production delays and release date changes, his dream film is finally making it to theaters. Most of the buzz generated for the film had been created by the film's problems both on and off the set. Such rumors included fights on the set and Leonardo DiCaprio delaying production over money issues. Whether or not it was over money, the film was delayed several times over the course of a year being moved from December 2001 to July 2002 only to receive a release date on the week before Christmas Day 2002, one year after it was originally planned. If the film is truly another masterpiece from the famous director then all these headaches will be worth it. But could all these problems overwhelm the $100 million budgeted film?<br />The story for Gangs of New York focuses on the oppressions of the Irish Americans forced upon them by the \\"native\\" Americans. Amsterdam Vallon returns to the city of New York after spending nearly sixteen years in jail. New York was once his home before his father, leader of the \\"Dead Rabbits\\" gang, was killed by Bill the Butcher, the leader of \\"natives\\" who opposed immigration in America. Amsterdam returns to the mean streets seeking revenge and joins the \\"natives\\" in order to get closer to Bill. Bill forms a special bond with Amsterdam and treats him like the son he never had, not knowing that Amsterdam is secretly plotting his demise. Along the way, Vallon sees the horrible conditions the Irish are living under and decides to raise up a gang not only to fight against the \\"natives\\" but the corrupt government of New York. The story of Gangs of New York may seem great on paper but when it is brought to the screen, it just becomes too confusing by the end. The main focus should have been the historical aspect talking about the time period and political corruption but by adding the Amsterdam subplot, the two stories get too jumbled together to find a clear perception on what is going on. <br />The Martin Scorsese flick is impressive for its large assemble cast alone but the main characters are well done as well for the most part. Gangs of New York is the first of two films Leonardo DiCaprio opening around Christmas Day 2002 but both roles show that he can't boast his acting ability outside of Titanic. He does a pretty good job at making the audience accept him as an Irish immigrant but the main problem is with the character's story involvement. Amsterdam is way too complicated to fully understand that the plot never fully clears up unanswered questions about him but that is not DiCaprio's fault. Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent as Bill the Butcher. The accent he gave the character as well as the stirring emotions sets the mood for a \\"native\\" New Yorker in the 1860's. The only character in the film that seemed out of place was Jenny Everdeane, played by Cameron Diaz. Once again it is not the actor's fault but the fault of the script. Diaz does a wonderful job with the character but there just seems to be no point to her outside of being attractive eye candy.<br />Overall, Gangs of New York, as good as the buzz tries to make it out to be, is a big disappointment. The story of the film is the most noticeable problem. The era of the 1860's is a fascinating time to set a film against but the problem is that the film fails to remind people what is going on at this time. When they join the historical aspect of the script with the Amsterdam revenge plot, the whole thing just becomes too jumbled together to get a straight story out of it. How the historical aspects were handled was also a problem. The fact that the Union and the draft were shown in a bad light was probably the most upsetting part of the entire film. The three hour time length of Gangs didn't help the story as most just seemed drag on. When one part of thestory seems to be going in one direction, it ends up just being turned into another direction. Scorsese could have saved at least a hour and a half of the audience's time by cutting out many unwanted scenes to direct us straight to the ending instead of dragging it out. Speaking of the ending, this has to be one of the most disappointing endings in quite awhile. They built all this emotion and intensity into the characters but that is just ruined with this ending. There are good things about Gangs of New York but they are so few and far between that they can be mentioned right now. See the film by all means if you really want to see it. If not then wait for the rental on DVD.
B000060P79|1.0|Simple Plan punk?!?!? Did everyone believe him when Carson one day said on TRL that Simple Plan was one the best up and coming punk acts. Here's a newsflash...Simple Plan is not punk, however, they do belong in their own genre...let's just call it Nasal Whining. For anyone who likes them, I just want to know what kind of melodic satisfaction do you get from listening to this? Better yet, I think 99% of Simple Plan fans listen to these guys just because it's &quot;cool&quot; since everyone else does. Using Simple Plan as an excuse to be accepted by society is pathetic and the lowest the American pop listener has ever gone. If you're a fairweather Simple Plan fan, then you are probably interested in other brainwashing media-made icons such as Britney Spears, NSYNC, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, and finally, believe Metallica is the most talented metal band around. You must be proud :)
0316096199|3.0|The majority of reviewers here are rape survivors, as am I. But my rape occurred 30 years ago and I thought I 'was over it'. Thirty years ago there was no counseling; woman generally kept it a secret and just got on with life as best they could. <br />I bought this book because I was interested in reading about how someone else 'got on with it' and found that she apparently didn't. What I gained from reading this material was the personal discovery that having been raped was still affecting my life and relationships and, I resolved to cover this old ground with a therapist so I could really move past it. <br />I agree with one reviewer that the ending felt like being dropped from a ten-story building - it was incomplete and sudden. The book contains the author's recollections of this horrific event albeit written in a curiously detached and emotionless voice and she never really fleshes out the story or provides a satisfactory conclusion. I sincerely hope that she finds the resources to help her really come to terms with her rape and to see her family in a more realistic light - they don't deserve to be thanked at the end of her book - and see damaging and isolating dysfunction in its true light. <br />In the end, the book is a useful read for anyone who's survived the violation of rape. Because the book is not 'about you' it's easier to see that it's illustrative of what to avoid, how to recognise when people are supportive or not, putting blame where the blame belongs and recognising the cathartic value of real anger. <br />I disagree with some of the reviewers here that she was too self-centered. A memoir, by definition, is self-centered and I didn't get the sense that she wrote this for anything other than catharsis. It has the same value as listening to someone else's tale and recognising in yourself what you could improve, change or acknowledge.
B00008H2LB|1.0|If a band like Linkin Park is successful in America, it obviously shows that there is something wrong with the music scene here. I cannot pick out one element of Linkin Park's music which makes their sound attractive enough for people to actually buy their CDs. You have 2 vocalists (i'm sorry, 1 of them is a rapper, pssh) who constantly whine about broken relationships. They might as well hire 2 neutered cats for vocals. I really wonder if current Linkin Park fans (mostly the tone deaf) think this band is going to be around forever. They'll drop off the face of the earth like Jesus Jones did in late 1991. I guarantee this. At least Linkin Park couldn't hold a candle in the wind to Jesus Jones, who at least had substance and depth in their music.
0385504209|5.0|Really Good, Starts a great hook, and keeps the suspence up untill after the book is closed, well worth the 7 houres i took to read
B000089RVX|1.0|I can't believe it. This group takes credit for something that has been done countless times. Now just because euro-metal is not big in the states does not mean a band like Evanescence deserves to take credit for its style of play. Hey fans, listen to Lacuna Coil. Chances are great you have no clue who I'm referring to. Lacuna Coil's first album was made in 1998, long before Evanescence was even an idea. Lacuna Coil is more melodic, aggressive, and passionate than these poseurs. Whoever considers Evanescence goth most likely does not know what good music is or anything for that matter. Just look at what else fans who bought this album on Amazon also purchased: Staind, Sarah McGlachlan, Dido, Godsmack, oh and my favorite, Linkin Park. Give yourself pats on your backs, folks. You are only making these undeserving acts richer while they're stealing not only your money, but your ears too.
B0000020C4|5.0|Ever since this 10th Anniv. Celebration was broadcasted on public television back in 1995 I have been totally in love with Les Miserables.  This soundtrack to that wonderful performance is just as exceptional as the production itself.  The best voices from past productions (including the one and only Jean Valjean Colm Wilkenson and the highly acclaimed Michael Ball as Maurius) were all pulled together for this anniv production and the result is astounding.  For those like me who have heard mainly the Les Mis soundtrack with the Original Broadway Cast - use this set of CDs to re-discover of charm of Les Miserables.  If you are looking for your first soundtrack for Les Mis - this is the one to get. I highly recommend this soundtrack and the DVD as well.  This Dream Cast performance at the Royal Albert Hall really IS a dream and everything else as well.
B000000HZT|5.0|I'm old enough to have heard just about everything \\"prog rock\\" has to offer.  And I'm the first to admit there is much to be ashamed of (the excesses of ELP, the vocals of Marrilion, the musical ugliness of Dream Theater, Asia, Genesis after Duke, later incarnations of King Crimson, and so on). No wonder so many people hate complex music!<br /><br />But there have been a few moments of real joy, beauty and musical thrills.  In The Court Of The Crimson King, A Trick Of The Tail, Stand Up, Chicago #1, Shades Of Deep Purple, The Doors, In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed, McDonald & Giles, Smallcreep's Day, Spectral Mornings, Anthony Phillips' 1984 and anything by the still undiscovered Kevin Gilbert.  You're either nodding your head or have no clue to what this paragraph says....sorry.<br /><br />If you had any doubts, A Curious Feeling makes it clear Tony Banks was the musical \\"brains\\" behind Genesis.  Everything good from Genesis is traceable to him and/or Anthony Phillips.  The one thing he can't do is sing and on this album, he doesn't.<br /><br />Its fair to say if you like Genesis you'll love this disc.  But please don't lump this in with crap like Follow You, Follow Me.  This is the real deal.
0767836286|5.0|Dude this movie is totally off the hook, I mean how often is it when Tim Robbins is scary.<br />Tim Robbins is horrifying in this thrilling epic of anarchy and terrorism. Jeff Bridges is a teacher who begins to investigate his friendly neighbors. When it turns out they have a weird past weird happenings happen. When it all comes down to Jeff Bridges and the anarchy is he going to shut them down or are they going to use him for their benefits?<br />I bought this for my dad and I was like 'What is Happening?' most of the movie then at the end it all pieced together. Like the back of the box says you cant breathe for the last twenty minutes. Buy this movie!
B00008PW2D|1.0|Very disappointing. Without any engaging relationships like Carrie and Mr Big or Aidan and Carrie, there was nothing to keep you watching from one episode to the next. Each episode was bland and one could not even get any excitement from Carrie's fashion wardrobe like the previous seasons when my girlfriends and I would be oogling over what Carrie was wearing. This season our expressions were more &quot;what the hell is she wearing?!&quot; as opposed to &quot;gorgeous dress; great shoes etc&quot; Not one of the episodes were memorable or engaging.
0790733226|5.0|In 1985, Pulitzer-prize winning author and astronomer Carl Sagan (1934-1996) wrote a brilliant &quot;what-if&quot; scenario in his novel entitled &quot;Contact&quot;.  In the novel, Carl Sagan created a scenario in which his protagonist, a radio astronomer named Dr. Eleanor Ann 'Ellie' Arroway, discovers an extraterrestrial radio transmission that is clearly from an intelligent alien source.  The discovery causes intense debate between the proponents of science, religion and government that eventually leads to some very compelling questions on the nature of faith itself.  In 1997, the novel was transformed into a film of the same name under the direction of the well-known director Robert Zemeckis, who had previously directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994, for which Zemeckis won the Oscar for Best Director), &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; (1992), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) and &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984).<br />Carl Sagan, with assistance from writers Ann Druyan, James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg, slightly modified the original story by giving Dr. Arroway (played by Jodie Foster) a more personal adversary in another astronomer, Dr. David Drumlin (played by Tom Skerritt).  At the beginning of the film, a brief exploration of Dr. Arroway's childhood (played by Jena Malone) is provided that helps to establish her purely scientific perception of reality that resulted in part from the passing away of her father, Ted Arroway (David Morse), who had also encouraged her love of science, astronomy and radio communications.  As an astronomer, Dr. Arroway dedicated her work to the SETI project (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), which Dr. Drumlin considers frivolous and potentially damaging to Dr. Arroway's credibility.  With her governmental funding cut, Dr. Arroway eventually gets private funding after she approaches one of the world's richest and most influential men, S. R. Hadden (John Hurt).  With funding secured, Dr. Arroway's search continues at the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico.  With her unorthodox method of personally listening to outer space static, Dr. Arroway suddenly and unexpectedly hears a bizarre set of sounds.  She immediately gets her team, which includes Kent Clark (William Fichtner), busy working on analyzing the signal, which likely comes from an extraterrestrial source.  Once verified, she announces her discovery to the world via the news media, to the disdain of governmental officials including Dr. Drumlin, National Security Advisor Michael Kitz (James Woods) and then President Bill Clinton (himself via archive footage).  It also gains explosive response from very religious individuals who don't necessarily share Dr. Arroway's enthusiasm, except for Father Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), whom Dr. Arroway met in Puerto Rico in a more than casual sense.  The content of the message itself raises some very large questions.<br />What really brought Carl Sagan's vision to life in &quot;Contact&quot; was placing it within a contemporary timeframe.  This included the use of many real events, people and places that included CNN, the VLA, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and many cameos from current politicians the television personalities (Jay Leno, Larry King, Geraldine A. Ferraro, Geraldo Rivera to name only a few).  Also, Robert Zemeckis placed actors within archival footage in much the same way as he did with the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in 1994.  All of this, as well as superb acting from the principal actors (Jodie Foster, Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, John Hurt, William Fichtner and James Woods), great cinematography, wonderful sets and great special effects make this a brilliant film.  Other memorable characters include Rachel Constantine (Angela Bassett), Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), the NASA Mission Director (Tucker Smallwood) and Joseph (Jake Busey).  Some of the most memorable scenes in the film include Dr. Arroway hearing the message at the VLA, the public response, the political discussions, Dr. Arroway meeting S.R. Hadden, the machine, Dr. Arroway's relationship with Palmer, the pinnacle event and its aftermath.<br />Overall, I rate &quot;Contact&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  In my opinion, it portrays many very probable debates and reactions if astronomers ever actually do discover intelligent extraterrestrial communication signals.  I applaud Carl Sagan for his vision, as well as Robert Zemeckis and the many actors and other people involved with the making of this very engaging and compelling film.
B00008973Q|4.0|This movie has a mythological aspect to it, which I suppose comes from the experiences of the Great Lord Hidetora wandering the volcanic countryside in his varying levels of madness. This to me is the main part of the story, while in the background the destruction wrought by Taro's former wife brings down everything that Hidetora had built. This shows how quickly an empire built upon the bodies of one's enemies can come crashing down, especially if you leave vengeful people alive. Hidetora's early ruthlessness as a conquering Daiymo comes back to haunt him at every turn, now that he has been abandoned by most of his sons and peers. (Which Hidetora set in motion himself by relinquishing power to his eldest son) It is only the honest love of his youngest son Saburo that brings Hidetora back from madness, and even this is temporary, as once again his legacy of blood comes back to seek final revenge in the form of an assasin's bullet that kills Saburo. Hidetora then dies of a heart attack caused by the ultimate suffering he has endured for weeks without end. It is perhaps a deserved fate for Hidetora, but Saburo is the real tragic figure here, having done nothing but honor his father even when shunned by him early in the story.<br />The film itself shows excellent and breathtaking examples of the Senkogu(sp?) period of war in Japan, with castle assaults and a small field-battle towards the end of the film. (curiously absent is the lack of actual sword-to-spear combat scenes, most depicted combat in the film involves arquebus troops and cavalry) The costumes and sets are excellent, no cgi here, just live actors in suits of armor and hundreds of horses. My only major complaint is the rather obvious 'red' of the fake blood used for the battle scenes, and the way it was splashed onto the bodies depicted throughout the film, which wasn't a very good attempt on the part of the film crew to be realistic. It's the story that matters in this film though.<br />I have not seen theMasterworks edition, but the standard DVD has a slightly poor picture quality for a film from the 80's, with some color issues (faded coloring). Hopefully the Masterworks edition is of better quality, but my gripes are only minor and the standard DVD is satisfying enough.
B0000VAFNQ|1.0|I bought this movie last night, BIG MISTAKE, I had never seen it but i read the online reviews and it seemed to get good reviews so i decided to get it. I only gave this movie one star because i had too, It was some of the worst acting i have ever seen, The Werewolves looked stupid/retarted. Kate Beckinsale was the only good thing about this movie and not because of her acting. If you havent seen this bore dont waste the time or your money like i did. <br />Overall I can sum this movie up in one word.....SUCKED!!!!

B00005FGNM|5.0|I find it difficult to trust anyone who dislikes U2 or, in particular, this album. They are surely boring people.<br />&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; turned my head completely around when I was 17 years old. Its music and lyrics continue to insinuate themselves into my life some 17 years later.<br />No other band speaks to me the way these guys do, and this is their greatest album. The older I get, the more I find most other bands as boring as the people who &quot;don't get&quot; U2.<br />These guys matter, and their music matters. They are as important to me as The Beatles were to the generation before mine, and I am not the only one.<br />&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; will still sound fresh, relevant and powerful thirty years from now. Musically speaking, what else can you say that about?

B000002LFL|5.0|This album was my introduction to The Smiths, and when I finally heard the original recordings I never felt the band's studio sound measured up to the raw quality of Rank. There is an intensity that runs throughout. When I first heard it aged 13, this album brought on the most intense feelings of connection to the music. Finally, someone understands me! Boo hoo.<BR>I'm over that now, but whenever I put Rank on it's still blows me away

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I received Concert for George DVD/CD set as a Christmas gift and have watched it or listened every day since; it's great even to watch/listen to while exercising, cleaning ... anytime I need a lift/energy, I pop in Concert for George.  Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne (sounds so much like Roy Orbison), Billy Preston, Ringo Starr, Tom Petty were all absolutely awesome (yes, Paul McCartney too) and watching George's son Dhani was eerie/almost like seeing George from the past along with the rest in the present; he seemed so much like his Dad.  Other performers whom I was not familiar with (Joe Brown, Jools Holland, Sam Brown) were absolutely wonderful.  My only disappointment was that Sam Brown's version of Horse to Water was not included on the CD (what's up with that?)! Sam was the absolute best (sounds like a Brit Aretha Franklin)/so not right that she was omitted from the CD version!  I've since ordered Sam Brown's Stop CD and another Jools Holland CD (I had never heard of these guys before but believe me, if you like jazz and R&amp;B, you'll absolutely love them).  Joe Brown was great/interesting that the Beatles used to support/intro his band before Beatlemania hit the world. I would rate this DVD @ #1, not 65!!
B00006FDCD|5.0|Let me just say that stephen king is the BEST AUTHOR!!! most of his movies (with the exception of dreamcatcher and the tommyknockers) have scared the socks off me! This movie (along with Pet sematary and The shining) scare me every time i watch them. anyway \\"it\\" is about these seven kids (or the loser's club as they call them-selves) who live in a town where \\"it\\" lives. they go out and try to kill it (there is more but this is just where i am going to start) and they think they do but they really don't! so about 30 years later mike (on of the kids but now a grown man) still lives in dairy (the town where \\"it\\" lives) and \\"it\\" comes back so he calls up all his buddies and they all come back and go and try to kill \\"it\\" Again. ok i left out a lot of stuff but thats just so you will find out for your-self! I urge you to go rent this movie! but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands because this movie is around 3hrs! but its still way scary!!!
B00005JKED|4.0|Best:<br />1) Denzel Washington proves that he can be as hateable as he usually is lovable. Now that's acting.<BR>2) Some scenes may remind you of how you felt during the gut-wrenching parts of \\"Scarface\\" or \\"Goodfellas\\".<BR>3) We get to see a very naked Eva Mendes in a few frames. <BR>4) There's a commentary track and a host of special features.<br />Worst:<br />1) It's intensely downbeat, so don't expect to go away with a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling.<BR>2) The descent into evil lifestyles may disturb you more than expected.<br />Recommendation:<br />If you can handle it, you'll be stronger for having seen this one. Women may not like it nearly as much as men, since it's the exact opposite of a 'chick flick'.

I tried hard to finish it &amp; I did, now I feel sick. The music is really horrible. I think Zeta Jones really made the movie stink even more than it already did. HORRIBLE I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! (0)STARS !!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|In the opinion of most music fans, tribute concerts are generally looked down upon- there's usually too much happening at once.   In many cases, the artists are quite egotistical and everything ends up sounding too mushed up.   <BR>This is CERTAINLY not the case for &quot;Concert For George&quot;- nothing could be further from the truth.   It's amazing- you can tell that all the artists are there to pay homage to Mr. Harrison, not to showcase their own talents.   The Indian segment (starring Ravi and Anoushka Shankar and their band) is extremely touching- it's amazing to hear the sorts of harmonies that result.   However, the best two from that set are &quot;The Inner Light&quot; and &quot;Arpan,&quot; in which Eric Clapton joins the band with his acoustic guitar.<BR>    After the Monty Python skit, Jeff Lynne emerges joined by Dhani Harrison, Eric, Tessa Niles, Katie Kisson, Andy F. Low, et al.   That would be the core band throughout the evening, with the exception of Joe Brown's band and, of course, those rockin' Heartbreakers.    The highlights of the show, in my opinion, are &quot;I Want to Tell You,&quot; &quot;If I Needed Someone,&quot; &quot;Give Me Love,&quot; &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; &quot;That's the Way It Goes,&quot; &quot;I Need You,&quot; &quot;Handle with Care,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; and &quot;Isn't it a Pity.&quot;   In all of these songs, you can almost feel George's presence in the Royal Albert Hall.<BR>   I think that a special thank you should go out to Eric Clapton.   Being a huge fan of Clapton's music for the past ten years, I've always known that Eric is, was, and always will be the greatest guitarist to ever set foot on this Earth.   However, as witnessed from this DVD, Eric does a PHENOMINAL job as organizer and M.C.- anyone who could organize a concert like this deserves incredible applause and recognition.   Yet, thoughout the concert, Eric never really takes the spotlight all for himself (unlike Mr. McCartney, from what I gathered).   Even when it came time for soloing, Eric put his heart into his playing but didn't play excessively at all.   Thank you, Eric Clapton, for putting this all together.    R.I.P George.
B00005JKHN|1.0|I was not impressed with this dvd at all. Even though it's older you should not keep producing movies that stink. I could hardly sit through the entir movie. The sound for the movie is incredibly awful as well. I do not recommend this movie to any child. Parents who just watched it as a child &amp; say that it is good. You have to know the truth!! Don't make any kid sit through this pathetic peice of junk!!!!!! HORRIBLE I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!
6304437137|5.0|A two-part episode, this is one of the best in the series. The special effects when the shuttle is diving for the clouds on the ice planet still wear well after all these years. When you consider that they were created for a seventies television show, it is even more incredible. A human scientist, Dr. Ravasholl, so engrossed in his research that he ignores the consequences, creates a super weapon for the Cylons that they are using to threaten the fugitive colonial fleet. The fleet has been carefully herded to a point where they can be threatened by the gun, so a small team is sent to the ice planet in an attempt to scale the mountain and destroy the gun. Unfortunately, most of the team members are criminals, chosen out of necessity for their experience in harsh environments. <BR> Shot down on their way to the planet, the team crash lands, yet survives. In their trek to the mountain containing the weapon, the colonial team encounters a society made up of clones, the consequences of another project of Dr. Ravasholl, referred to as the father creator. The clones, fundamentally slaves to the Cylons, help the colonial group scale the mountain and successfully destroy the gun.<BR> This episode also contains some of the best dialog that appeared in the series. Two of the human criminals in the assault team are husband and wife and her line, \\"To have Croft and myself in the same place at the same time invites disaster\\" is masterfully delivered. Even the turncoat Baltar is able to speak some decent lines rather than engage in repeating cliches about his hatred for Adama.<BR> If all of the episodes had this level of episode specific special effects and quality dialog, then this series would have had a longer run. Unfortunately, the same effects were constantly repeated and the dialog was also recycled. Nevertheless, this is by far one of the best episodes, with some of the best of both.
B00003CXB4|3.0|I like the movie &amp; think it is very exciting but the remake dvd edition I don't really care for the added songs &amp; stuff. I like the original version better. the new song sound like a totally different person which it is. For the movie 5 stars for the remake 3 stars
0385720920|4.0|Have read &quot;Fight Club&quot;, &quot;Choke&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby&quot;.  All excellent books.  Reviewer from Chicago, Il has written reviews on all of Palahniuk's books, giving all of them one star.  The reviewer gives long rants about how the books are crap and people simply carry them about in public as a means of achieving some sort of social recognition.  Yet in any of the reviews given, there has yet to be any analysis of the books themselves.  Reminds me of when right wing conservatives call for the banning of certain books because of their content without ever reading the books themselves.<br />Palahniuk is good at exposing the darker side of modern day society through fiction.  If you like books along the lines of the classic &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, check out any of Palahniuk's books.  <br />If you're too afraid to read them, leave the reviews to those that aren't.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I was expecting this to be a not so good film due to some of the reviews. It turns out that I really enjoyed the story &amp; the visual effects were awesome. I think the love story gave it a more in depth to people that lived during the pearl harbor tradgedy. Michael Bay did a great job. I think he is one one of the better directors. He also made The Rock &amp; Bad Boys 1 &amp; 2. GREAT MOVIE!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I really liked this cd, and I would consider myself a new Nickelback fan.  I liked amost all of these songs.  'Someday,' and 'Believe it or not' are my favorite songs.  Vocals are strong and unique.  Chad has a very distinctive, wonderful voice.  This is a must have!!!!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|This film took me back to college days, to traveling overseas, to being thrown into situations with folks from other cultures, doing things I would never dream of doing now.  I found it to be perfectly delightful, and the funniest film (in a laugh-out-loud way) I've seen in a long time.  Xavier, the lead character, is a French student who is advised to learn Spanish in order for his father's friend to place him in a plum economics job in Paris.  So, gullible &amp; a little happless, Xavier grabs his backpack &amp; dons his Levis, and marches off to Barcelona to study abroad in the Erasmus program.  The first scenes in which Xavier is trying to navigate his way around Barcelona, struggling under the load of his luggage and his inability to speak Spanish, reminded me of the challenges of being a stranger in a strange land.  Xavier eventually finds himself being interviewed for a space in a chaotic apartment shared by a Brit, an Italian, a Dane, a German and a Spaniard.  More than anything, he wants to be accepted into this apartment, and ultimately, he is.  During the course of the year, he takes seduction lessons from a lesbian woman in one of his courses, seduces a French physician's wife, seemingly forgets about his girlfriend Martine back home (Audrey Tautou), and then tries to reclaim her after she's broken up with him.  The year abroad is so full of promise, excitement, learning (and he does, in fact, learn Spanish).  After Xavier returns home to Paris from his year abroad, the film shows him eating a steak dinner with his hippie mother at their kitchen table -- underscoring the fact that the vacation is over.  No more twelve different bottles of beer &amp; various international sauces and a million different langage being shouted across the crowded table in the Spanish apartment -- this is back to real, DULL life.  It perfectly depicted the let down one feels (or at least I feel) after a fascinating trip abroad.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer who found the lead character despicable, and found his change of heart at the end of the film (abandoning his high-finance job) inexplicable.  This is a coming of age film that perfectly explains the decision, and when the protagonist runs away from bureaucracy in the end to pursue his goals of being a writer, I found myself cheering.  Had Xavier accepted the suit job analyzing markets, with the only excitement idle gossip with fellow suits over the water cooler, I don't think the viewer would think that Xavier learned anything from his time abroad.  The film capitalizes on stereotypess of Europeans (the German is very organized, the Italian carefree, the Brit responsible . . . ) in an entertaining way.  The filmmaking is also very interesting and well-done.  This movie is one to buy and share; it's not merely a renter.d the lead character despicable, and found his change of heart at the end of the film (abandoning his high-finance job) inexplicable.

B000089RVX|4.0|Well in general this is a good cd.  Amy has great vocal abilities and the band is great but I think the music dwells on the negative, dark, depressing things.
B000003C2S|5.0|Great old school Death Metal CD, This was their best album in my opinion, Symbolic And Sound of Perseverance got a little to &quot;Technical&quot;, this is REAL DM, not that Grind/Gore/Death/Grind crap, Stick with Death, Suffocation, Obituary, In Flames, Pestilence, Hypocrisy, Dark Tranquility, forget the Grind, but anyways, buy this album today!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this cd has got to be her best. a whole lot edgeier and a good dance beat. good for a party or even sex.
0859652777|5.0|Marilyn Manson in my oppinion is one of the greatest rock artists ever and apparently he's not a bad writer either with his autobiography going from his weird experiences in his Granpas basement all the way to his to the release of Antichrist Superstar,but Manson also has a nice style of writing the novel,<BR>he tells you about everything from how he got the band members to join and he also tells of the time he lost his virginity allowing us deep down into the depths of Mansons past.He does not hold back at all telling us about the time he got crabs from a chick and everything including his plot to kill his girlfriend<BR>Nancy with his fellow bandmate keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy.<BR>At then end of the book he has rumors posted by his &quot;fans&quot; on his website [...] or [...]<BR>But the book is really a work of art from one of the most genius musicians of our time and this is a classic novel.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is a terrific album.  Chris Cornell has got one of the best voices in rock today, Tom Morello on guitar is full of energy and creative but classic riffs, and Wilk and Commerford on drums and bass make sure you will be banging your head long after your neck muscles have given out.  There are times when Cornell's voice sounds like an instrument, and the synergy of these four guys is heavy and gorgeous.  I'd say this strong vocal-guitar duo with blues-based rock and strong beats is quite reminiscent of the classic Led Zeppelin dynamic.  Production gives the group a full sound with a garage echo.  Cover art is by Storm Thorgerson, who has done work for Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.  Booklet includes lyrics.<br />Usually when I buy a new album I upload 3 to 5 songs to my computer -- from this album I ripped 10 of 14 songs.  My favorites are Show Me How to Live, What You Are, Gasoline, Bring Em Back Alive and The Last Remaining Light.  As well as having excellent vocals and playing, the lyrics are interesting and mature -- not just of the &quot;gotta have you, baby&quot; variety.  Shadow of the Sun starts out over a subdued and lyrical guitar lick, &quot;Once upon a time/I was of a mind/to lay your burden down.&quot;  What lovely phrasing.  And how can you hear &quot;Now you've found another slave/Now I'm free from what you want/Now I'm free from what you need/Now I'm free from what you are&quot; (from What You Are) and not think this is rock at its very best?  I think this album will stand the test of time.  I've been listening to it over and over for weeks, and it always makes me want to move and sing along and bang my head against a wall.  Isn't that what rock is supposed to do?<br />Awesome, passionate rock.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is a bit of a departure from &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; in that as a general rule it is a softer and more ambiant affair than the last time around. It's brooding and quiet and calming in an uncomfortable way, everything that we've come to expect from APC (and occasionally TOOL). Some people seem to be a little bit thrown initially because of the softer pace and a lack of catchy rock tracks, but I assure you that upon further listens you'll find that the new sound is just as strong and often more powerful and moving. I would highly suggest picking up this release if you are a fan. If you are new to A Perfect Circle, and like music with depth, ingrigue, and vision then I urge you to give this a chance. If you aren't sure, find a way to listen to the track &quot;The Noose,&quot; which is a standout here and encapsulates their new sound tremendously.
068981528X|4.0|Kids and adults will enjoy this comic retelling of the classic story of a bully and the three hapless siblings he has targeted -- yes, you guessed it -- the three sweet little wolves and that big bad pig.  The illustrations and text are very funny as the pig uses increasingly hefty items to tear down the brick, metal and armored houses built by the wolves, until at last an unexpected material proves that even bullies have their limits.  A fun read.
0811729117|4.0|Author Otto Carius is the kind of soldier whose wartime service in the Wehrmacht reflects credit upon every combat soldier of the German army.  It is a pleasure to read such a straight-forward, honest personal narrative such as this that confines itself exclusively to the author's own frontline experiences.  I agree with Carius that it is a disgrace the heroism and sacrifices of men like him have not, until only recently, received the recognition they deserve.  Those of us who were in Vietnam know what it's like to be reviled by our own countrymen. Robert Edwards' English-language translation deserves special credit.  The appendices in this book will be of special interest to the military historian and the facsimile reproductions of Carius's awards and citations, expertly translated, will be of particular interest to the militara collector.  But I have given this book only 4 stars because it slows down considerably about halfway through.  How many assaults and attacks can you absorb without becoming bored and bogged down in details?  These combat accounts eventually become only a little more interesting than the official after action reports themselves, which Carius had when he wrote this book, and some of which are in the appendices.  But overall this book is the story of a brave and honorable soldier, of value to anyone interested in armored warfare, but more importantly, a succesful attempt to balance the horror stories about the inhumane conduct of the German army in Russia during WWII.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|Columbia Tristar you are a loser!!  You took a great film like Annie (1982) and shortage all of us with 1.33:1 .  This is an OUTRAGE.  Why this is even called a Spedical Edition.  Lucky I already own the widescreen version.
0385504209|3.0|This is one book I am having a hard tme reading.  Think I will try to continue reading and maybe will stick with it.
0783235380|4.0|This is a very refreshing comedy and Sandra Bullock makes it so.  I think this is one of her best roles if not the best.  Sandra is very alive there and very natural.  The movie itself and Ben Affleck are somewhat plain but it is still funny and very entertaining, thanks to Sandra Bullock.  I give 4 stars to the movie and 10 stars to Sandra Bullock.
B00005JMTN|3.0|Tim Burton's BIG FISH is essentially two hours spent hearing the stories of Edward Bloom, the sort of guy who, in real life, would be considered obnoxious and unbearable but, in a movie, is regarded as a quaint treasure. Bloom's tales of giants, circus freaks, werewolves, enchanted fish, enchanted towns and one-eyed witches in the mountains of Alabama are clearly fiction, though not really good fiction. In the film, his son is annoyed - looking to hear a bit of truth from his dad before Bloom drops dead.  All he finds out, unfortunately, is that his dad didn't stretch the truth all that much ... and, apparently, that the truth wasn't really important anyway.<br />Yeah, in a movie, it's supposed to be all uplifting. But I refuse to see Billy Crudup's character in a negative light just because he's the only one refusing his father's painful whimsy. If you were sitting next to Edward Bloom for a long period of time, too, you'd want him to stop talking nonsense, too.<br />BIG FISH, which all Tim Burton fans will rush out to see, is his most grounded-in-reality film, I suppose. It's got a clever group of actors who make the most of the material that they're given.<br />The main problem with the film, I guess, is that Burton himself is far more interested in the colorful world of Bloom's stories. Burton's never been very good at a connected, driven narrative, anyway. It's always been more style than substance.<br />Because of that, Burton all but ignores making the \\"real life\\" bits as good as the stylized \\"stories.\\" And the two elements never really come together. Never is there a moment where we feel the character McGregor is playing becomes the character Finney is playing, and the film needs that.<br />It's pretty to look at, but it's a letdown.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Gangs of N.Y. explodes on the screen 'cause it's a total<BR>BOMB !  It's way too long, the actors are way over the top<BR>or just uncaring. The script is hokey, the dialog is fake<BR>and DiCaprio must have realy needed the money. The only <BR>good film he ever made was &quot;This Boy's Life&quot; in 1993.<BR>DO NOT buy, rent or get Pay per View for Gangs of New York.<BR>The photography was beautiful...That's it !<BR>Russ
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I heard about this show, I was skeptical. However, I heard only good things about it. I just picked it up on a whim. Wow. What an amazing series! Of course, now I lament that it is over. I am very happy they are making a movie...I am a big fan now! Joss, you are the best.
0679777547|4.0|Perez-Reverte certainly cannot be accused of writing a standard suspense novel. No, he's turned the genre on it's ear and written a fascinating page-turner that leaves the reader guessing until the final pages.  If you like novels that break the rules instead of just repeating what everyone's done before, then this is the book for you.
B00005JMTN|5.0|No more words needed: Excellent Film 10 out of 10
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. I've owned the soundtrack for years and have since stopped listening to it. This CD is different; it's fresh, it's clean, and it has no gimmicks. I can't stop listening to it!
B000059ZLH|2.0|Being a friend of this group since I can remember listening to music, you may safely assume I am not doubting the excellence or authority of Dream Theater here.<BR>BUT..this video must be the worst production I've witnessed since the early days of my DVD collection (back in 1999).<BR>The sound is so cluttered that feels like a monophonic recording. The High Frequencies are away on vacation and the Bass is completely messed up...<BR>Let alone the horrific graphics popping up all the time making the picture at par with the rest production, SIMPLY UNBEARABLE!!!
0446677450|5.0|The last reviewer didn't like this book because it wasn't telling the story he must have wanted.  I loved this book because it did just what it said it would.  It taught what rich people know and poor and middleclass don't.  This book opens your mind to new possibilities and gives you the hope to better your life and the lives of your children.  I think Kiyosaki did a wonderful job expressing that in order to make a good living, you need to fully understand finances and how to make your money work for you.
B00000ADG2|5.0|\\"The Miseducation of...\\" shows the artists of the R&B/Soul/Hip-Hop genre how a real album is done. Undeniably 1998's Grammy winner: ALBUM OF THE YEAR. (Back when the Grammy's recognized good music!). <br />The critically acclaimed record features vast amounts of musical diversity. From hard-core hip-hop on \\"Lost Ones\\", to the Spanish Guitar intro of \\"To Zion\\", to its sweet but hard hit gospel chorus, to the organic melody of \\"Everything Is Everything\\", to the classical piano training of the title track. <br />Mrs. Hill addresses many themes/subjects which other artists in the genre won't. She questions the negativity and (sexual) immorality of hip-hop acts on \\"Superstar\\", to the emotionally killing Love/Hate romance we've all experienced on \\"Ex-Factor\\". To warning us about the dangers of sexual immorality on \\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\", to God's unchanging grace and forgiveness on \\"Forgive Them Father\\", all the way to testimonial Lauryn on \\"Final Hour\\". <br />Like most R&B albums, a vast majority of songs feature samples of `60s and `70s songs. On \\"Superstar\\" she cleverly incorporates lyrical and musical excerpts of Jim Morrison and the Doors' classic \\"Light My Fire\\" to prove her point on the downfall of pop music. Another highlight of `60s flashback is on her rendition of karaoke hit \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\". <br />It is thought provoking, inspirational, fascinating and even life changing. Lauryn makes people around the world think of their actions. In my opinion one of the greatest gospel records, my opinion of `Gospel' is telling people of God's word. And the way Lauryn Hill gives us lectures on Christian ethics in the C21st on sex, money, temptation and sin never sounded so good! <br />This album gets a well deserved 5/5, because it's one of the most soulful, real and relatable album of 1998 to 2003. Plus Lauryn wrote, arranged and produced the entire album, not bad for a One-Woman show!

B000002UAX|5.0|Okay, I agree with many of the reviewers of this album.  Here are my reasons why the &quot;white&quot; album is the Beatles' greatest:<br />It is by far the most diverse Beatles album.  From parody to storytelling to Rock to ballad, they covered it all.  I've hardly seen a 2 disc album that is truly worthy of both discs.  Why do you want to devote the extra time to another disc of more of the same?  Do not shun the second disc!  It contains less radio-friendly material, more personal, interesting stuff.  'Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey' is a perfect blend of humor and introspection.<br />It contains While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the best George Harrison song EVER.<br />Most importantly, they were not afraid to be experimental.  Revolution #9 might not be a favorite Lennon song, but you don't see bands trying this kind of stuff.  Except the Beatles.<br />There.  Now go get it.

B000003TA4|3.0|Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; album ushered in the acceptance of punk rock in the mainstream. For many, this was the second coming. But was Kurt Cobain really all that? Unfortunately, what people fail to realize is that this style of music wasn't anything new in the 90's. In fact, I remember listening to bands similar to Nirvana in the early 80's. This included punk bands like Minor Threat, Die Kreuzen, The Germs, The Adolescents, Social Distortion, Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys and the Circle Jerks. None of these groups achieved superstardom like Nirvana. However, they were all just as interesting. For Kurt Cobain and the members of Nirvana, although very talented, being in the right place at the right time was certainly a key to their success.
B00000099Y|5.0|Music nowwadays is going to hell, al this crap about 'getting low' and 'shaking it like a salt shaker' is crap tool is a great band anf Maynard is a great vocalist ig you think they are &quot;too dark&quot; or &quot;too in depth&quot; for your likeing then don't listen to them but don't put them down while your listening to that other crap out there nowwadays that the artists who sing them don't even write. This cd is excellent and gives Lateralus a run for it's money it may take awhile for it to sink in but when it does you will understand why it deserves 5 stars
B00009NOF4|2.0|There are reasons for you to purchase this CD but there are also reasons not to buy it.  You have to fit into one category (buy or don't buy) and that is what I will help you decide.  You should buy this disc if: 1) You love everything Radiohead has put out to this point, or 2) You have no previous knowledge of Radiohead's past recordings, or 3) You have faith in most critics choice of music.<BR>You should not buy this album if:  1) You list your favorite Radiohead albums in this order, The Bends, OK Computer, Pablo Honey, Kid A, Amnesiac, or 2) Your least favorite Radiohead songs are the ones that nearly put you to sleep or the ones where Thom extends each word to ten times there normal length, or 3) You are looking for an upbeat positive album, or 4) You have a friend who can let you listen to it first(don't take their word for it if they say it is good).<BR>As for other hints to give you I guess just use a thesaurus when you read a review and look up confusing words to see other words they could have used.  You probably will come across boring more than once.  Please just don't be one of the people who force feed themselves subpar albums, like this one, and regurgitate false genius.  For me this album was about 90% of what I don't like about Radiohead. Chances are if there are characteristics about Radiohead you don't like you will hear plenty of them on the album.
0312263120|3.0|Maybe I expected too much after just finishing the DaVinci Code. DaVinci was meticulously researched and Brown revealed the whole story like he was peeling layers of an onion. I read DaVinci in one sitting. I literally could not put it down.<br />Digital Fortress was in the same vein as DaVinci. The formula is almost point for point a close of DaVinci. This is a complex mystery with believable and well developed characters. What bothered me was much of it did just did not make much sense.<br />I don't wish to spoil the novel for anyone who has not read it yet so I won't go into any of the major plot elements or twists, but for example:<br />If the NSA was supposedly stumped by an unbreakable cypher and the algorthm source code was available even if encrypted, then why would the NSA want to destroy the key and the code? If the algorthm really was unbreakable by their billion dollar beast I would have wanted to study every aspect of the code not destroy it without ever seeing it. How could they be sure there was not another copy or some other programmer would not redevelop one just like it in a year? Makes no sense, no one questioned this. Susan should have been all over it, but she insisted it be destroyed.<br />The other bothersome things was Brown supposedly used the technical advice of retired NSA cryptographers to add techincal realism. However several plot elements made no technical sense.<br />For example: If the Fortress code was posted encrypted using fortress itself, you would need more than just the passkey. You would need the Fortress program itself to decrypt it using the passkey. Just having the passkey only would not be enough. If the fortress program was available in a compiled format then the NSA could have easily (maybe not easily -but I am sure they could do it) decompiled the program to reveal the algorthm. Having the passkey would not be vital to understanding Fortress. The passkey alone would not have been enough to open up the encrypted files. Neither would a &quot;brute force&quot; attack on Fortress have ever been able to crack it. It would have to have analyzed and broken structurally.

B00008CLOA|5.0|Listening to Dark Side of the Moon brings back memories of a generation. A generation that, musically, I was unfortunately not involved in. Dark Side of the Moon is one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever made. A steady heartbeat commences and closes the album. In between is some of the best music ever made. This is definetly worth buying again on the new 30th Anniversary edition, because the sound is clearly better. Although the original artwork is changed, and the back has the songs on it unlike the original, the music is still the same, and possibly better sounding. The lyrics in the songs are beyond compare. The sounds us by manually cutting tape and feeding it in the machine were revolutionary, and much more so because of the lack of technology that we have today. There were no drum machines in the 1970's. The album falls into a theme, perhaps except 'Money'. The theme is a relaxed, melodic type with incredible talent displayed on all instruments used. The vocals are...inspiring. When I first listened to 'Us and Them', I felt incredible emotion. It send me into tears, but I was incredibly happy at the same time. The Great Gig in the sky features incredible vocals by Claire Torry, where she sings no words, but an incredible, Aretha Franklin-type wailing that sends melodic shivers down a spine. 'Breathe' and 'Time' are very innovational songs. Of course 'Money' is a landmark. The ridicule of modern culture of the domination of the drive for money and power in people in the lyrics of the song are only made better by the slamming guitar, saxophone and percussion. The medley of 'Any colour you like','Brain Damage', and 'Eclipse' are a perfect end to a perfect album. For lovers of simply good music, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon' is a necessity.
0440238609|5.0|Much like the classic \\"A Wrinkle in Time,\\" this three-part adventure is an exotic blend of both genres. It's sci-fi because of the main themes (traveling between universes), but it's fantasy in supporting themes (the dæmons, talking animals, etc. are all fantasy related things.)<br />But just because these amazing books cannot be fairly placed into a category doesn't rule them as bad books. In fact, this is one of my favorite series I have ever read, and to me they compete strongly with the Harry Potter series. <br />There are so many lessons taught in this book that it makes me realize why they had always been destined for young adults. These ages (between 11-14) are ages of extreme importance in life, where you are not yet a teenager but not a kid, either. You are stuck in this middle-place where you have to learn your own lessons, develop your own views, devise right from wrong, and ultamitely find out \\"who you are.\\"<br />Which is why these books helped me so much. You've got it all here: you learn about guilt and its effects, about risk-taking, about loyalties, about betrayal, about anger, and vengeance, and love, and friendship, and trust, and decison-making, and family. On our adventures with Lyra Belacqua through the tundra of the North, we watch her lose her naïveness of childhood and watch her gain some adult attributes. Every mistake she makes, every blunder, we see: we are there to see her try to fix it and watch her pay the price. Book One was a fun-filled, enthralling ride that couldn't be put down. More and more mysteries and answers begged to be answered so the reader has no choice but to read.<br />Book Two is much the same. It's very thrilling, and exciting, and we watch Lyra develop and mature and grow even more. It is in this book where she loses her \\"the world is so cruel, I have to conquer it and find my father\\" attitude, and instead has a more determined but smart view on life, basically realizing she must end the craziness in her life but also realizes that there are other important aspects of living. She learns about companionship when the outspoken Will Parry crosses her path, and he, too, is a young and eager human who also is seeking something.<br />Book Three is my personal favorite, only because of the evolvment of the caracters and the quality of the writing. Will and Lyra are determined as ever to finish what they started. More characters enter; loyalties strengthen; Lyra is almost an adult. She is intelligent and brave and is fighting a hard battle and is constantly forced to make hard decisions. Pullman's skills are at its greatest here; never before had the characters seemed so real, never before had I felt so much for them, never before had each and every question been answered. Everything, from the strange Dust to Lyra's past, is revealed. The suspense dies down. In a strange way, the evil characters don't seem so evil and the good characters don't seem so good, but it seems now that Pullman is done explaining, done identifying, done describing his world. By book Three, the world is complete and vivid with its \\"realness\\" that his work is done and no more books need to be written. The story is told and is finished. Lyra and Will's lives, post the Amber Spyglass, are left unknown. don't want to reveal everything, since the books are so good and the ending is so touching that I'd ruin it by revealing any more details.<br />Botom line, a unique story, great character development, and great plot. Pullman's dæmons are simply the most intersting and lovely things every created (I wanted one quite badly after Book One.) This series is one that will appeal to nearly everyone and even adults can appreciate the great story Philip Pullman writes.

B000002C1V|5.0|I'm biased.  I have no shame in admitting that.<br />Though I am an enormous D. Gilmour fan, this is a R. Waters solo project, and regardless of Gilmour's input, it remains only a R. Waters solo project. This is the last time you'll ever experience the &quot;connection&quot; of Dave and Roger collaborating at the same time.  As a floyd freak, I would be remiss to say this is anything less than genuine.  Despite the boyz comments after they booted Roger, this is a phenomonal effort and worthy of accommodation.  After all, what would Floyd be w/o Dave or Roger? Nick and Rick aside, this is a triumph of a concept album. Nothing in the 90s can touch what Roger conceived. These 'spare bricks' are the sequel to The Wall everyone forgot, but they are a vision into the eloquent sorrow Mr. Rogers experiences from the loss of his father at the hands of WWII.<br />It's not electric or radio-friendly.  It's the Final Cut.  Take it or leave it.

Fast paced, with twists and turns; I stayed glued to the book the entire 2 days it took me to read. He is very detailed, offering the reader a clear mental image of the events as they unfold. I could almost see the nanorobots, feel them while they attacked their prey with calculated intent...always learning...and watching...
B0000844MS|3.0|Coming a couple of years after the far more accomplished Dark Crystal this is relatively straight-forward but still a helluva lot more imaginative than any family movie of recent years. You could call it a modern fairy tale, but it's just not deep enough. And for a film called Labyrinth, it's strangely uncomplicated.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly (younger and prettier, though her acting is questionable) stars as Sarah, a teenager who bizarrely doesn't have a boyfriend and ends up living in her own fantasy world. Her dad and stepmother go out, leaving her to babysit her baby brother. Annoyed with his crying she utters a magical spell, wishing the goblins to take him away. Sure as sugar, the Goblin King himself (Tina Turner, oh sorry...I mean David Bowie) turns up and takes away the screaming tot.<br /><br />In order to get him back she must solve 'The Labyrinth' (cue dramatic music) and reach the Goblin King's Castle within 13 hours. Along the way she meets new friends (of the Jim Henson variety) in the form of Hoggle the dwarf, big, hairy and cuddly Ludo and cute little fox Sir Didymus. It's pleasant enough entertainment but there are some serious problems.<br /><br />The most serious of them all is David Bowie's attire. Most specifically, his trousers, they are a little revealing in the crotch department to make an understatement. You'll cringe, you'll avert your eyes, yet you'll be mesmerized. Come on, how could this have been allowed in a family movie. Plus, Trevor Jones' score is disappointingly unmagical and the filmmakers have given in to the urge to have David Bowie crank out some dreadfully 80's tunes that stagger the action and hold up the plot.<br />It's a shame to call Labyrinth nostalgic. But if it were made today it would be full of hollow CGI. There's something charming in practical effects and puppetry (or is that Muppetry?) that no computer graphic can generate. The photography and is stunning and it captures landscape and fantasy perfectly. And all those cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit.<br /><br />Filmed in Panavision, the 2.35:1 1080p picture looks good, there's hardly any grain, no dirt and perfect colors, with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a good amount of extras.hose cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit.<br /><br />Filmed in Panavision, the 2.35:1 1080p picture looks good, there's hardly any grain, no dirt and perfect colors, with DTS HD-MA sound.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|Jet is the best band to come along in the last five years! No one is better then them. They are making rock I mean reall rock and roll not crapy pop punk(if there is such a thing?) or annoying death metal, real rock. Jet is like a cross between Ac/Dc and The Beatles.<br />Get Born is one of the strongest rock records I have heard in a very very very long time, it has great rockers like 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl' and 'Dj' and sweet ballads as well. Get born is a perfect blend of rock and pop. This album is concistant and strong. The lead singer has a great raw rock voice and they have a pretty decent lead guitar player.<br />I think in a couple of years if Jet keeps their music this good then they will be the biggest band in the world. Dont miss out on this gem!

B000003CMB|5.0|Never has there been a live album better then The Allman Brothers At Fillmore East. The tone is clear, the mood is right and the music is nothing short of amazing! Even the extended jams are classics, in fact thats what makes this live album so great. Many people concider this the greatest live album of all time, and I cant dissagre! When i write about live albums I usualt only talk about the sound and if the band pulled off the songs, I cant do that here I have to talk about each track.<br />'Statesboro Blues' is an Allman Brothers classic with killer slide by Duane, its one of the bands best covers!<br />'Done Somebody Wrong' is a killer song, its just absolutly perfect!<br />'Storm Monday' this song always kinda gave me the creeps its just kinda errie to me and i fond my self listenin to this song over and over again.<br />'You Dont Love Me' is a bluesy rock type song sure to please everyone with its out of this world guitar.<br />'Hot 'Lanta' is one of the best songs on the record, and one of the best songs The Allman Brothers ever recorded.<br />'In Memory of Elizabeth Reed' This was Dicky Betts best instrumental before this, but when they played it live for this album its made it 1000x's better his guitar work here is nothing short of breath taking!<br />'Whipping Post' yes the legendary Whipping Post is mind blowing, it is the single greatest live extended jam ever recorded period! The guitar is like a religious experince, it is truly amazing and the the highlight of the album!<br />I wish I could have been At Fillmore East the two nights when The Allman Brothers recorded this legendary album!  And you will too once you hear it!

B000006TRV|5.0|This is a great Pink Floyd album, even though Roger Waters took this as an opportunity to prove that this was his band. Many of the tracks on this album are moving and show great meaning.<br />First of all, I don't understand all of the one star reviews, saying that Pink Floyd fans don't know what real music is. Many of those people are people who listen to hardcore power rock bands, and call Pink Floyd slow, boring, and a band with no musical talent whatsoever. Look who's talking. I've heard Slipknot, tried to listen to them, but all those bands do is play one note on the guitar, and the singer screams. The only real talented musician is the drummer. These people are calling David Gilmour a bad guitarist? Please.<br />This album features great songs that you'll sing to yourself all of the time. For example, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; may be one of the best rock songs ever written. &quot;Hey You&quot; &quot;In The Flesh (one and two)&quot; and &quot;Nobody Home&quot; are some of my favorites also. And, you can't forget the &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; trilogy.<br />This is a good album for all Floyd fans to hear. This also may be the album to start off with if you are just getting into Pink Floyd. It was mine, and I liked it right away. I'm not guaranteeing that you will, but try it out. <br />Might I also suggest seeing the movie (staring Bob Geldof) written by Roger Waters to better understand this CD and the words to the songs.

B00006AUIG|4.0|Actually only 3 1/2 stars, but I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.<br />Fifteen years ago, the Psychiatric Hospital on the hill was closed and 2400 patients transferred or let loose.  Now it is time to clean up the building, and Gordon Fleming barely manages to get the bid, promising almost impossibly quick results in order to save his business.<br />Gordon and his friend Phil hire extra men to get the job done, including Hank, who is dating Phil's ex-girlfriend and does not mince words with Phil about it.  Our crew is filled in with Bill and Jeff, who is Gordon's young nephew.<br />The old buildings are now graffiti ridden, dangerous with water damage and heavy with asbestos.  During their original tour, Gordon hears a voice speaking to him from down the hallway of ward C, the ward reserved for the most dangerous of patients.<br />Delving immediately into the huge project, we catch glimpses of each character and see their responses to the eerie environment of their job.  Bill runs across some old tapes of a long dead female patient, labeled Sessions 1-9, and begins listening to them.  She had multiple personalities, and the more Bill listens, the more disturbed he becomes.<br />Hank finds a treasure in the wall that enclosed the old crematorium, and abruptly leaves both his job and his girlfriend to go to a casino school in Florida, but young Jeff finds him stalking the grounds of the asylum, and after that things get really weird.<br />Without revealing anything further about the movie, let me tell you what I liked and disliked about it.<br />What I liked was the spectacular scenery, stunningly beautiful footage of the old hospital, and deeply sinister shots of its rotting interior.  Location was used to astounding effect, providing one of the chilliest atmospheres I have ever seen.  Add to that some eerie tunnels with only flashlights for lighting, sunlight streaming hazily through dirty windows, amazing cinematography utilizing the shoot scene to its fullest.  Not to mention a creepy storyline of bad things happening in a bad place, and stellar acting by David Caruso and supporting cast.<br />What I didn't like was that the development was too slow for true terror to strike me, there was too much filler dialogue and too many scenes with nothing important happening.  The movie could have been tightened down quite a bit without loosing the magnificent photogenic effects, almost as if not quite enough film hit the editing floor.  With 100 minutes not being a long movie, this particular story might have been a better effort at 90 minutes, cutting the dribble here and there that left me starving for the tastier parts.<br />It's possible that I'm just too jaded for this type of experiment, but I failed to feel any real threat...no tantalizing shiver for my safety and well-being.  Too loosely does the movie travel until we finally see any form of evil, and in that I found it to be a bit fatiguing instead of intriguing.<br />Still, its chilling atmosphere makes up a great deal for the drudgery, and you will want to stick around and find out what Simon has to say.

B00005JM02|1.0|Dude,before you decide to watch this movie,don't watch this movie.It's the biggest load of crap ever.Sure,the animation is great,but that's really the only good thing about it.Dory the bluefish turns this into a one-joke film,and it's funny for about half an hour before it grows old.It disappoints me that Disney may stop making traditional animation films after Home on the Range.Finding Nemo is so terrible that they should reconsider and stop making their CGI films after the Incredibles,which I could boycott after seeing the trailer.And their traditional animated films are improving after such a while.I loved Brother Bear(whe's the DVD coming?),and I loved Lilo and Stitch(when's the real sequel coming?)but when Dory starting speaking like a whale,I literally yawned like a whale.It sucks.I apologise to all the five star reviewers out there,but yes,it sucks.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This romance flick is simply irresistable and so romantic! I could watch all over again this movie. The settings are absolutely fantastic, New York is the right choice for filming this movie.

The casts are wonderful and incredible, John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are the newest silverscreen's sweethearts...they truly blend with their own wit and charm. The supporting casts are great, Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon added more fun and twist to the movie. So far, 'Serendipity' maybe included to one of the best romantic films ever made...what can you ask for? Romance, humor, charm, destiny? They are all here in this one sweet movie.

B000063DHL|5.0|It's unbelievable how many people mention Nicko's work here with very modest words! For the unenlightened: In the drummers' world, he's often cited as the world's fastest right foot. And this album shows this _fact_ clearly. I can't imagine that even the foot-profs like Virgil Donati, Simon Phillips or Gregg Bissonette could play some of these songs with one foot.<br />OK let's begin. Listen closely to the \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\", after the intro. He does these 8th-triplets and doubles in an mind-numbing tempo with his right foot (4th note at ~140-150 bpm), without a sweat. Even if you can manage to do it once or twice, you can't endure that long.<br />If you don't get satisfied with that, then listen to \\"Deja-Vu\\"! Pretty much the same incredible foot-work, but now with the addition of some very nicely placed hi-hat opens. He pulls off it very easily but don't you try this at home.<br />If you need more than speed & endurance, then take \\"Wasted Years\\". He hits the bass drum every 4th downbeat, whereas opens the hi-hat every 3th, playing some independent paradiddles with the hands, and makes it odd-time by adding an extra note every 2 measures. It took me years (though without much practicing, and with the \\"independence-feel\\", not computing the times) to play that chop. I've heard many Maiden cover-albums with this song in it, but no drummer can play it as fluent as Nicko does. And creatively, he wrote one of the most distinct and unforgettable grooves to one of the heavy metal's finest melodies (Adrian's intro). From a creativity point of view, in my book this rhythm proudly stands next to Gene Krupa, Neil Peart or Steve Gadd grooves. IMO, a nice groove should be complicated in its simplicity, and Nicko definitely manages to do that.<br />Though the album is full of Nicko's gems, his snare-roll on \\"Alexander the Great\\"s intro deserves particular mention: It is one of most homogeneous rolls I've ever heard in an album, you can't hear the initial speeding-up or force exertion, it simply begins and ends, like a car goes from 0 to 60mph in zero time! The vaguely-heard bass & hihat notes give it an even nicer edge.<br />Although Nicko didn't compose a song until recent \\"Dance of Death\\" his additions to Maiden albums, and especially \\"Somewhere in Time\\" are fine compositions in themselves.<br />Well, if you've listened to the album and still don't get convinced with his talent, I'd say you better need a slap on the back!<br />Anyway, surely he isn't a technical freak like Steve Smith, Mike Mangini or Terry Bozzio, but his performance on this album is the reason that I've started playing the drums 17 years ago and it's still in my \\"best of\\" list, and he's hell of a nice \\"band drummer\\" (his solos are funny :P). Too bad, _IMHO_, he couldn't match this performance & originality; except Brave New World came very close. Whatever.. In his style I'd say \\"This guy is 'kin' unbelievable he is\\" ;)

He was a great vocalist but how he nearly destroyed this wonderful band is unforgivable (go to [...] for an interview with Herbie Herbert Journeys original mangaer to uncover the Truth about Steve Perry). Now onwards we go. Kudos to Steve Augeri to step in to such big shoes and to sing the songs we all know and love with such passion is unbelieveable. Deen Castronovo a great replacement for Steve Smith and he adds a new demention to the band with his vocal talent as well. As for Neal (the true heart of this band), Jonathan , and Ross what can you say about these great musicians except wow....this band since Steve Perry has left has not only grown but acutally has gotten BETTER. So heres to looking in the future with this wonderful band and to seeing them on the road for many more years to come...For the Wheel in the Sky keeps on turnin....

B0000VCZKM|1.0|I was all set to purchase this disc Tuesday.  I'm glad I checked this site because there is no way I'm buying a pan & scan-only version in the year 2004.  I thought the reviewers must by mistaken, there is no way that this would be released full screen--one reason is that it's a musical with dancing!  But every site I check lists this as full screen.<br />I wouldn't have bought it full screen when I only had a 4x3 TV and I certainly won't buy it now that I have a 16x9.  I'm sure the great majority of TV owners still have 4x3's and I bet this won't really turnaround until the end of the decade, but this is no excuse for the format of this release.
0140157352|5.0|This book provides many practical examples on the art of negotiation. The author begins by encapsuling a negotiation into<br />a tri-parte process:<br />o It should produce a wise agreement if such a thing is possible<br />o It should be efficient.<br />o It should not damage the relationship between the parties.<br />A successful negotiation will meet the underlying concerns of the<br />parties. There are four points to a successful negotiation:<br />o Separate the people from the problem.<br />o Focus on interests and not positions.<br />o Generate a variety of possibilities.<br />o Insist that the result be based on an objective standard.<br />In addition, a good negotiation will present the various<br />options fairly. The parties should develop objective<br />criteria and fair procedures. When the other side attacks,<br />consider it as an option and improve upon it. Remember that<br />affirmative answers generate resistence and questions elicit<br />answers (thoughtful or otherwise). The essence of a principled<br />negotiation lays the foundation for a discussion of facts and<br />basic principles.<br />This work is a gold mine of advice on the art of negotiation.<br />It will help you to navigate through difficult situations artfully<br />while deflecting as much resistence as possible. This book will help you because it points out the<br />pitfalls of negotiations between parties; namely, adherence<br />to rigid positions, unwillingless to hear the other side and<br />attacks on people. The objective of a good negotiation is to<br />produce a fair result and to set forth rational guidelines<br />and rule structures for the parties to follow. This work<br />teaches contrary to the way people typically behave. As such,<br />it provides readers with scenarios that may not be in their<br />domain of everyday experience.<br />The author emphasizes the futility of adherence to rigid<br />positions without exploring alternatives and agreeing on<br />fair rule structures to evaluate the issues presented.ctures to evaluate the issues presented.
0786915749|3.0|I waited 10 years to read this book and the best thing I can say about this book is that I finished it.  None of the characters made me like them or want to know more about them.  I wondered why the draconians were all so easy to kill.  With an army monsters that weak, I wonder what all the fuss was about.
0743243307|4.0|Add my voice to the chorus of praise for Monica Ali's Brick Lane. I especially enjoyed the way she stayed focused on Nazneen's life, but also deftly expanded the story -- through time, with memories of her family; and through space, with letters from her sister in Bangladesh.<br />The parting of Nazneen and her hapless husband was done very well:  her genuine affection for Chanu and his acknowledgement of his own failure were shown with great delicacy, in very moving language.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Don't get me wrong. This is by far the greatest movie in the last few years. However this version is a bare bones just get it out DVD. Wait till christmas 2005 when QT has promised he would release both movies together with tons of extras.
B00006JIA4|5.0|There are CDs that are good to get up and dance to and there are CDs that are good to listen to while relaxing and very rarely do the two meet. This box set doesn't just have a mixture of dancing songs and reflective songs but almost every song on here is good for BOTH dancing and reflecting (although there are some which you'll have trouble reflecting to simply because of how powerful the urge to dance to them can be). I'm a 15 year old who is so sick of the hip hop and teeny bopper music we get shoved down our throats nowadays (even the \\"alternative\\" stuff while good is nothing exceptional bar a couple of artists such as pearl jam and powderfinger) that I've been buying a wealth of CDs from times gone by and I must say that while almost all of those old CDs I've bought have been a success this one is right up there with the best 2 or 3 of them. <BR>Also, I must say that the people complaining about the 3rd CD are (for lack of a better word ie. one that amazon.com will allow on it's site) stupid. While not as good as the first 2 CDs the third is certainly a good CD in it's own right (one that I personally listen to more than number 2 although I do skip a number of tracks). \\"Too much love will kill you\\" is a beauty and \\"somebody to love\\" with george michael is a better version to the original. while these are certainly the best 2 on CD 3 other songs including \\"heaven for everyone\\", \\"living on my own\\" and \\"no one but you\\" are strong songs too.

630542845X|5.0|'Powder' is not what one would surmize from the cover. Sean Patrick Flanery portrays a teenage albino boy, who has the amazing ability to conduct electricity and is the most intelligent being in the world, all a result of his mother being struck by lightning. He can read people's thoughts, making him slightly bitter and a loner when he ventures out from his grandparents' farm. Rejected by everyone but a woman who runs the center where he lives (Mary Steenburg, the woman who plays Joan's mother in Joan of Arcadia), he finds himself in love with a normal girl, who finds him interguing, the only one who dared to get close enough to touch him. Yes, I admit, the movie has some flaws in its design but it is the best attempt at something different in the movie world I have seen in a while. Everything is not what you expect: he's not eventually accepted by the boys of the center, the townsfolk don't &quot;magically see the light&quot;. No. He is an outcast, a loner but that is what makes the movie such a great watch and the emotion displayed by Flanery is amazing, something that will attach itself to your soul and will you to see things differently in your world.
B00009W0U4|3.0|I think that Growman's review is very helpful, and I would incorporate the majority of his comments as my own.  However, I am not sure whether the director's intent may have been &quot;cherish life, love each other more.&quot;  Maybe so, but trying to figure out what the director intended is really a moot exercise and quite frankly irrlevant to the review of the film.  What this film did for me, I felt, was showing how different violence can be perceived: violence in its raw form without explanation, and violence with a seed of vengence.  By having the sequence of events played out in reverse, my initial reaction to the brutal death at the beginning of the film was &quot;oh my God, why?!&quot;  Then, I watched the scene again after watching the whole film, and my reaction suddenly turned to &quot;Yes, he deserves it.&quot;  I wasn't proud of my second reaction, yet I think it does speak the truth to human nature.  By the way, anyone noticed that the person who was killed at the club was not the right guy??  (the rapist had a tape over his nose, who incidentally was watching his friend getting beaten to death by Pierre).  I am not sure whether Alex was indeed the one who suffered the most, considering that Pierre goes to jail for life having murdered someone in third-party self defense but against the wrong person . . .
B00006RU5B|5.0|I absolutely adore Audioslave. This whole entire CD is fantastic, every song is a good one, and it's a rare group that can strike a chord like that in me (Nirvana being another group like that).<br />The music has a perfect blend between being &quot;hard&quot; and having a strong musical quality, infused with a certain style that just can't be imitated or satisfied with any other group.

B00005QW4K|4.0|I'd like to preface my short review by saying that this is one of my top 5 movies of all time, and that the &quot;4 star&quot; rating does not reflect the movie (5 stars), simply the DVD.<br />On to the DVD....<br />I own 2 of the 400 different Army of Darkness releases: the Original Army of Darkness DVD, and the Bruce Campbell vs. Army Of Darkness - The Director's Cut (Official Bootleg Edition) [Whew!  Thats a long title!]  I DO NOT own the &quot;Boomstick&quot; version of the film, and this review is not for that DVD release....Do Not Be Confused with the version you are buying.<br />Each DVD release has their own quirks.  Having a 57&quot; Hitachi Projection HDTV and a Harmon Kardon DVD player, I was stunned to see that the image quality of the Bootleg Edition was exceptionally poor.  It is so poor in fact, that I prefer to watch the original DVD release.  It is, however, formatted to fit 16:9 widescreen format.<br />The original DVD release of course does not include additional footage the &quot;way the Director intended&quot;, and although it is &quot;widescreen&quot;, is not formatted for 16:9 monitor's.<br />Like I said, I do not own the &quot;Boomstick&quot; version, so I can't speak to that.  I hope they fixed all the aforementioned problems in it though.
0060090383|4.0|I got this book for a gift from someone who has pretty much the same taists as I, I don't think I ever would have picked it up myself, but I stated reading it and could not put it down.  The main charracter, as screwed up and flawed as she is, is SUCH a hoot.  I could just relate to the bar scene and the lifestyle she leads from when I was in my twentys.  The difference is, Rachels freinds grow up and become a little more responsible, and Rachel wants to keep partying and becomes a total mess.  There are some very funny scenes that made me laugh out loud.  I will be reading more by Marian Keyes for sure!
0385505833|3.0|How could you avoid Christmas?  It's everywhere during the month of December and even a good chunk of November.  I think that the Kranks did a wonderfully fine job of \\"skipping Christmas.\\"<br />That time of year can really get some people MAD.  All the freakin' people driving too slow to get where they all need to spend away their savings like today is their last day on earth.  Of course, all those brilliant gift ideas are amusing, but in six months, are they really so great?  After countless hours trying to find that perfect gift and the time wasted waiting in line, all you have is a few hours of ripping open presents and saying \\"I love this!\\" over and over until it loses meaning altogether. That was how Mr. Krank was feeling when he made his decision to skip Christmas.<br />This book explains Mr. and Mrs. Krank's attempt to take a break from Christmas.  They must suffer embarrassment from their neighbors, co-workers and basically the whole town.  Mrs. Krank misses Christmas more than her husband does.  How would she live without a tree, without Christmas lights and finally without Frosty up on the roof?  The enticement of a luxurious island cruise, starting on Christmas day, is what brings her to agreeing with Mr. Krank's plan.<br />I know this is not his usual \\"genre\\" but I believe Mr.Grisham adapted well to the subject.  He describes all the little details about how miserable Christmas can be to some people.  Even if you do love and enjoy Christmas, this book will help you realize why others don't.  Plus, it is pretty comical what the Kranks have to go through to put Christmas out of their minds and home.<br />You will get into the spirit of Christmas or maybe you will feel the \\"wrath\\" of Christmas while reading this book.  Either way, I think you will have fun with this quick and enjoyable story.
B00009TB5G|5.0|First, let me say that I adore the books.  This extended version of the film adds many scenes that fans of the books (and also those who haven't read them) will enjoy.  We get more Merry & Pippin.  More Ents and \\"awakening\\" trees.  More Gollum/Smeagol.  A flashback which tells us more about Faramir, Boromir and their father.  And some priceless interaction between Legolas and Gimli.  The extended version of this and the first film really fill in so much detail that they shouldn't be missed by anyone who liked the theatrical releases.<br />The appendices are also excellent.  Having seen the additional material on The Fellowship of the Ring extended addition, I thought, \\"Do they really have enough behind-the-scenes info to fill up two more discs?\\"  And the answer is definitely - Yes!  As someone who has never been a big fan of how'd-they-do-that documentaries of films, I was surprised to find myself rivited by these.  Knowing all the detail and hard work that has gone into these films makes me love them all the more.  Additionally, anyone familiar with the books who wondered why they changed Faramir's character so drastically, you will get an explaination here.  (I still don't really agree with it, but at least I know what they were thinking now.)  And they go over the reasoning behind the changes to the ending as well.<br />Another feature of this addition is the packaging itself.  The outside slipcover is made to resemble a leather-bond book.  Inside you will find the case, booklet, and the discs themselves decorated with artwork and concept sketches from the artists who helped design the film.  The onscreen menus continue the book theme and also show many wonderful sketches.<br />In short, I recommend that you buy this, watch it, and then join me in eagerly awaiting the extended version of The Return of the King!
0060090383|3.0|This is Keyes' second installment in a trio of books about the Walsh sisters--the book that preceeds it is Watermelon, which focuses on oldest sister Claire, and the third book is Angels, the story of Margaret, the second oldest.  Rachel's Holiday features (of course) Rachel, the middle child of five sisters (the youngest two sisters, Helen and Anna, make appearances in all three of the books).  Rachel has been separated from her family in Ireland for the past eight years and has been living with her roommate Brigit in New York City.  After a night of \\"a little too march partying\\" lands her in the hospital to have her stomach pumped, Rachel is whisked back to Ireland by her sister Margaret and brother-in-law for a stay at The Cloisters, an inpatient addictions center.  Although skeptical that she needs treatment, Rachel agrees, thinking that a spa vacation might be nice after all--hence the book's title.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Rachel arrives at The Cloisters in a state of full denial; it slowly dawns on her that this is no holiday.  Through both her own experiences and those of the other patients (or \\"inmates,\\" as Rachel calls them), we see Rachel's attitude gradually begin to change.  Although the majority of the book takes place within the treatment center, the story also follows Rachel's departure from The Cloisters and briefly recounts her life during the 1 1/2 years which follow.<br /><br />Marilyn Keyes is a funny, engaging writer, and she does a good job here of injecting humor into a serious topic.  However, this light treatment of drug addiction makes it difficult to empathize with the real pain Rachel experiences at times, as her emotions tend to come off in a melodramatic fashion.  Furthermore, I found it hard to believe Rachel's extreme denial about her own situation, especially in light of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary which Keyes reveals to the reader little by little (however, perhaps an actual survivor of addiction would find that the story rings true).  Finally, at 592 pages, I found the book to be a bit too long to be the fun, light reading that it portends to be.<br /><br />Personally, I think that Watermelon was the best of these three books, but if you can't resist learning more about the other Walsh sisters, Rachel's Holiday and Angels are worth a look.he story rings true).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched probably 1.5 minutes of Firefly on TV when the series aired.  My Husband Loved it but I never made time, thinking that I really wouldn't be interested in a scifi series.  My husband was so disappointed when the show was apparently cancelled he refused to watch anything on Fox with me.  <br />This Christmas I bought him the DVD's, thinking that at least it would make him happy.  After sitting down with him to watch the first show I was hooked.  Now I love the show and I'm so sorry they took the show off.<br />I would buy this DVD set again just for me if my husband wouldn't let me watch his.  :O)
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Combining classic sci-fi elements with a touch of the western, Joss Whedon's Firefly was a sadly short lived show which Fox had the brilliant idea of cancelling before the season was even over.  Firefly's story revolves around the crew of the Serenity five hundred years into the future as they partake different mercenary jobs while on the run from the Alliance and other deadly forces.  Just like Whedon's other hit shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Firefly contained plenty of smarts and humor but also managed to keep the viewer riveted from beginning to end.  Rumor has it that Whedon is busy at making a Firefly film, which will be a must see for the show's surprising amount of dedicated followers.  All in all, if you missed out on Firefly when it was on TV, check out this series now that it's on DVD; you won't regret it.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I bought this movie hoping that it might be good. I was dead wrong. this is the worst movie i have ever seen. This movie seems like a comedy the way cage tries to act. Since when does a thompson hold fifty rounds? See U-571 if you want a good code movie.
B000000I3O|5.0|Known as both The Misfits' self titled album and as &quot;Collection 1&quot;, this album is a perfect introduction for new fans to the legendary and influential punk band.  Featuring previously unreleased versions of some of their most well known material like &quot;She&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, &quot;Horror Business&quot;, &quot;Teenagers From Mars&quot;, &quot;I Turned Into a Martian&quot;, &quot;Astro Zombies&quot;, &quot;Mommy Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight?&quot;, &quot;Die, Die My Darling&quot;, &quot;Earth A.D.&quot;, &quot;Devilock&quot;, and &quot;Green Hell&quot;; all of which display the simplistic musical structure and Glen Danzig's unholy howl.  Even though the production quality is poor to say the least, that doesn't take away from the album as a whole, and in the end this is a must have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How Fox could have been foolish enough to cancel this series is beyond explanation. As a fan of Buffy and Angel, I was anxious to see anything Joss Whedon had a hand in, even if it was science fiction, my least favorite genre. Firefly didn't disappoint, but it was frustratingly hard to see as it was constantly bumped off the schedule and the episodes were shown out of sequence. Since receiving my DVD set from Amazon a few days ago, I have been mesmerized watching these episodes, rewatching key scenes, listening to audio commentary and falling in love with these characters. I work from home and have found it difficult to stay on schedule, I keep sneaking into the other room to watch another episode. Whedon didn't just write a story, he created an entirely new and believable universe peopled by characters you come to view as real human beings. It's killing me to think I won't ever find out what happens with Mal and Inara, do Zoe and Wash have the child they argue about, do Kaylee and Simon ever get together, who and what is the Sheperd, will River outwit the men with blue hands and what will become of Jayne who makes me laugh every time he opens his mouth? Joss Whedon, you are a genius. Please, please find a way to make a feature film or get this show back on the air. To the cast of Firefly, you are all amazing. Thank you for hours of pure enjoyment.
6305841861|5.0|Absolutely frickin hillarious!!  My favorite scene was the laughing living room.  When the deer's head turned and started laughing at Bruce, I fell out of the chair, I was laughing so hard.  Great movie for laughs.  Gory but insanely funny.
B000002KAT|3.0|One of the great recordings from the 60's and one of Van Morrison's best. Nevertheless I have a big gripe with the quality of the sound and packaging. When is Warner Brothers going to remaster this recording as it (and all Van Morrison's Warner recordings) should be? The CD you purchase in 2004(!) is from a remastering done in the mid 80's -- at the dawn of the CD age. This and other Van Morrison recordings deserve the full treatment, with, at minimum, new remastering (and if possible extra tracks).<br />It took the record companies nearly 20 years (2003) to give the Rolling Stones' original albums the remastering they deserve (SACD). It has still not been done with the Beatles original albums which likewise were originally remastered in the early-mid 80's and sound terrible!!<br />There are in fact many original albums from the 50's, 60's and 70's being sold today on CD that were originally remastered back in the 80's with heavily compressed, flat sound quality. To me that is a rip-off considering the price we are forced to pay for CD's (often more than a DVD)!!!
B00008PW2E|5.0|Please release Season Two!  We have been waiting and waiting and waiting!  I am getting so frustrated at this point.  I am not sure why HBO is waiting so long to release this.  People are going to lose interest in the show if it isn't released soon.  Doesn't make good marketing sense :(
B0000039PW|5.0|This album is off the hook.  It is Nothing short of outstanding.  This was the first hip hop that i ever listen to and it is still one of the best albums that i have to this day.  This is Biggie just starting in the game, you hear the hunger in him.  For any hip hop fanatic this is a must have album in your collection.  From the crazy songs like Juicy, Big Poppa this album is a CLASSIC.
B00008PW2D|1.0|This season was definitely the worst so far!  Carrie looked absolutely horrible in this season.  Not to mention...all the women were so desperate to find a man.  What is up with that?  What happened to the group of four strong, inspiring women.  Why did the women have to become desperate manhunters??  Each episode was more boring than the one before.  Overall, very blah season.
0375432302|1.0|My gripes come in 3 areas:<br />FEMINISM:  Despite all the squawking about freeing the \\"sacred feminine,\\" this is not a feminist book.  What is the essence of the \\"sacred feminine\\"?  The womb.  What does the \\"sacred feminine\\" do? It allows men to experience divinity through sex with women.  What does the \\"sacred feminine\\" do for women?  Not a damn thing.  Who gets to decide whether the truth about the \\"sacred feminine\\" is revealed to the world?  A secret society with men at the helm.  Should this great feminist truth be revealed?  No, it should remain a secret because people like mystery.  It is enough that the \\"sacred feminine\\" shows up from time to time in hidden symbols in the arts.  The message  of this book was the the essence of women is something to be controlled by men.<br />Also, I couldn't help but notice that the female character is referred to by her first name, \\"Sophie,\\" while the male characters are referenced by their last names (e.g., \\"Langdon\\").  Why the difference in treatment?<br />CRYPTOGRAPHY:  No, Dan Brown, the granddaugher's name is not a brilliant password.  And the word \\"random\\" does not mean what you think it does.<br />PLOT:  It's completely implausible that Sophie and Langdon would ever have started this escapade in the first place at the Louvre.  What exactly was the danger Langdon was in, and why did it help to run away?  Their subsequent actions (kidnapping, etc.), were completely unjustified.  It was hard to identify with characters who were behaving so rashly.
6300271439|4.0|Critics and audiences treated this film as if it was supposed to be a &quot;serious film&quot;.  ITS NOT - that is why it received such bad reviews in the US.  &quot;Who's That Girl&quot; is a non-sense, silly film that will just make you laugh and appreciate the various jokes, puns, inuendos, etc.  I think it is a cute 80's film that got a bad rap.  There are a few serious, emotional moments in the film where you felt some sympathy for the lead character (played by Madonna) and realized she does have a soft side.  If you watch this film as pure entertainment and laughs, I think you will enjoy it as well!
B00005NTJM|4.0|If you enjoy quality late 60's British blues, good CD. If you are a J-Tull fan, good CD. If you are only a fan of the J-Tull hits or the style of their 70's to current, then you may not want to buy this one. Myself, I'm a Tull fan and wish to finish their collection. Blues music to me is OK (I prefer old blues like Hooker or Howling Wolf), but J-Tull's take on the blues is slightly refreshing as it is not just a rehash of someone else's songs and it marks the beginning of the J-Tull style. I'm not sure how this remaster sounds compared to the old one, but the sound is excellent.
B000058983|5.0|This is a music from the golden years of the music. Three magnificent songs open this CD and then it continues exploring melodies with their limpid voices. Simply great.
B000088E6D|4.0|I'd never heard of Michael Buble until I was wrapping holiday CDs for shoppers at Borders the week before Christmas, so from that standpoint, I'd say his marketing machine is not quite up to snuff.... but because I wrapped it so many times, I figured others must be onto something so I bought this eponymous CD.   Upon first review, I was quite pleased.  While other reviewers may critique Mr. Buble for not having a 'unique' sound, one has to consider both context and expectations.  Mr. Buble does a good job at reinvigorating some of the 'old standards' and adds pretty good production values in the process.  It is hard to imagine anyone who is looking for a new twist on some old standard and says &quot;Let's put on some good 'mood music'&quot; who is unsatisfied upon putting this CD in the machine.  It's all about context and expectations.  Buble delivers within the context in which he is working; it's somewhat original, but also very familiar....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just had to add my 5 star-rating to the hundreds here --and tack on some gushing words of praise about this horribly short-lived series.  Let me put it simply: I love this show.  I have not loved a show like this since I sat glued in front of the tv every week to watch \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" way back in the day (when i was just a kid being introduced to sci fi).  This show is just so FRESH.  I adore sci-fi shows but really, the pickings have been slim and rather lame in recent years.  Joss Whedon brought a whole new vision and feel to a tv genre that, I for one feel, has been dying a slow death.  The people at Fox who didn't \\"get\\" this show and not only didn't properly promote it but actively sabotaged it, obviously have had their brains rotted out from watching too much \\"reality\\" tv.  I only hope there's a special circle in hell reserved for them.  (I'm kidding!  I think...)<br />Reportedly, there is a possible movie in the works if this DVD set sells well enough (fireflymovie.com) so I can only hope that I will get some closure on these incredibly vivid characters and the unique universe they live in.  This DVD set is well done and you can really tell on the commentaries how much everyone who worked \\"Firefly\\" adored the show (and detested Fox).  If you love science fiction, westerns, either of Joss Whedon's other shows (\\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\"), or UNIQUE and INNOVATIVE tv, pick this set up.  This might be your last chance to catch a show this smart for quite some time...
B000021XS0|5.0|&quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; was a real good album, but sounded a bit like if Dream Theater meant just to stay in a safe place. Neither progressing, nor looking for challenges.  Rhythmically, harmonically, lyrically &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; is innovative, complex, hard to understand. Its lyrics are a sequel to  their previous classic &quot;Metropolis&quot; (I think it's not a secret anymore :-)).  We could say there's a synergy. Music becoming image. Of course we still can hear Dream Theater typical ballads (Aren't them all decent?). However they fit exactly where they are. Musically a few pieces impressed me more than others, yet my advice is hear them all in a row. Highlights: &quot;Strange Dejavu&quot; (short but hides some precious treasures.  I'd say  this is a  concise way to write superb prog metal), &quot;Beyond This Life&quot; (Can you imagine jazz fusion keys mixed with metal guitars? This song is very heavy, probably the heaviest here. Jordan Rudess shreds! Man this guy is incredible. How can a song be so beautiful and yet give you a headbanging mood?). &quot;Home&quot; (it was the 1st single from this album. Minor scales everywhere. A song that's pure passion, and an atmosphere that gathers Middle East with Rage Against The Machine, and Metallica. ). &quot;The Dance Of Eternity&quot; Probably the most complex piece here. Amazing instrumental piece. Recreation would be the best word to describe it without revealing anything). &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; (sounds initially like Pink Floyd, but then turns in a very powerful and emotional ballad. One of the best Dream Theater ever did). &quot;Finally Free&quot; (some very different vocal melodies, it's the prefect ending. ) Maybe I sound a bit unfair to Derek Sherinian fans, but Jordan Rudess was born to be part of Dream Theater. John Petrucci again is superb, a bit more free to play what he knows than on &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot;. John Myung seems comfortable, he's not stealing the show but is very tight. James La Brie is very emotional, very melodic like he was on &quot;Images  And Words&quot;. Mike Portnoy, well, Mike is what Bill Bruford, Allan White and Neil Peart once were but in only one person. Well that's it. Buy it as if you were buying the best album in years. Because &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot; is. Hope you find the samee show but is very tight.

0385504209|2.0|I was very excited to read this book, given the hype about it.  I have my own ideas of faith/God, but I thought the premise was very interesting and I had an open mind going into it.  However, as another reader said, the plot lost steam about halfway through, and I had to make myself finish the book.  I got to about 10 pages from the end and put it down because it was just taking so LONG!  Those last 10 pages were somewhat interesting, but like the rest of the plot, it was just too conveniently wrapped up.  Plot was thin, characters were thin, denoument of the plot was long and drawn out.<br />It's amazing what an author's agent/publisher can do to promote such a mediocre book.
0385484518|5.0|I thought this book was a great book with many morals that people can relate to coming from it.  It inspired me to realize what I had in my life, and what I thought about it.  The way he and his teacher connected for his final lesson and how Mitch took the time to FLY out and see him just blows my mind.  I thought it was a great book and I gave it a 5.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. This is REAL music. This is what every music artist should strive for. A near-flawless album, every song carefully expressed with such power, it's impossible to resist. <br />Keys brings back the classy, intellectual R&amp;B and showcases it with songs like &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot;, &quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;If I was your Woman&quot;, &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot; and the radio-favorite, &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;. <br />Keys has many modern-day R&amp;B songs, like &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Dragon Days&quot;, &quot;Heartburn&quot; and &quot;Slow Down&quot;. Still, even with the harder dance beats, she stays true to herself, giving all her songs real soul and emotion. <br />Alicia Keys is what many have been waiting for; a soulful, energetic, classy singer with inexplicable talent. Her voice, even when only speaking, is smoother than glass. One of the best artists of this century.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If youre gonna throw a party, this is the cd to get.

Plain fun/party music. This cd is defenitely a hit with great producers like Moby (Early Mornin)and R.Kelly(Outrageous). Amazing...if you wanna dance...get in britney's zone!
0345440900|1.0|I'm a maternity nurse, and I bought this book on the advice of a colleague.  Being an inexperienced new mom, I tried to follow Hogg's advice for developing a flexible routine for my newborn.  Instead of enjoying my son's first weeks, I agonized over the fact that he just didn't seem to eat/play/sleep according to her timetable.  Plain and simple, if you breastfeed, and feed on cue (which is necessary for milk production and for baby to thrive), then it is unlikely that your baby will fit the mould outlined by Hogg.  Her breastfeeding information is totally wrong and outdated.  I'm no \\"breastfeeding Nazi\\" as some of the reviewers have complained about, but the truth is, there are actually RISKS associated with formula, none of which Hogg mentions. (I won't elaborate, the advantages of breastmilk and the risks of artificial feeding are well known and well documented, a fact that seems to be lost to Ms. Hogg). <br />This is a good book if you are looking for an excuse not to breastfeed and not to feel guilty about it.  This is a good book if you don't want the inconvenience of \\"parenting\\" your baby to sleep.  This is a good book if holding and carrying your baby just because he wants it isn't something that you have time for.  This is a good book if you find that parenting is just a little too inconvenient and time consuming.  This is a good book if a good night's sleep is more important to you than bonding with your newborn. This is a good book if, instead of cuddling your baby, you'd rather preoccupy yourself with charting and plotting every feeding, wet diaper and bowel movement.  This is a terrific book if you want to learn how to train a pet.<br />I hate the fact that this woman made money off of me.  I won't even give the book away, for fear that someone might just follow her advice.  I gave up trying to follow her methods after a few weeks, read some other books by Dr. Sears and Elizabeth Pantley, and contacted La Leche League,the real experts, who by the way, Hogg portrays as a group who profits from promoting breastfeeding.    <br />Hogg is condascending and treats new parents as total idiots, and leads them to mistrust their instincts.  Parenting is never easy, but babies will, with time, fall into a routine.  Don't waste your time in reading this book, instead, cuddle your baby, let him fall asleep in your arms while you bury your nose in his fat this little neck and smell his downy hair.  Carry him around just because you want to.  Savour every second, it goes so fast.  Memories of sleep deprivation will fade, but the memories of the closeness you share with your baby will last forever.

B000000IW8|5.0|i dont think u can beat &quot;Destruction&quot;, but this is still a great album. mega-hit's 'November Rain' and 'Dont Cry' are great songs, but 'Coma' is my favorite song on the album. its 10-minutes of pure hard rock/metal. they have a great cover of 'Live and Let Die', and other great songs like 'Bad Obsession', 'Perfect crime', 'Dont Damn Me', and 'Garden of Eden'. there are no bad songs, and the ones i havent listed are still good songs. a must for GNR fans.
0440180295|5.0|This was the first book of Kurt Vonnegut's that I read and it got me hooked on him. He has a very simple and honest style of writing that I find very alluring. His books have simple messages and have both broad and finite subjects. Slaughterhouse Five is mainly an anti-war book but it touches on religion and science and free will or destiny also. Throughout the whole book the message of the meaninglessness and atrociousness of war is prevelent and foremost in his theme. Here and there though he touches other themes. He brings Christianity into it a few times and the way that he describes time as always occuring and no such thing as a past, present or future, goes against the human notion of free will which everyone would like to believe and he establishes a minor theme of everything being destined. He also brings a solution to the depression of the realization that we can't avoid bad times and war by saying to focus on the good times. Also the plain fact that the main character, Billy Pilgrim, survives the war, being as scrawny as he is, is a slap in the face to the theory of 'survival of the fittest.' Vonnegut's breadth of subjects along with his witty and simple writing style make this book a treasure.

0679428895|4.0|A fascinating novelization of the hours before Vesuvius's eruption, Robert Harris' romantic tale of good and evil weaves threads of volcanology, lessons from history of the Roman Empire with fascinating facts of the most revered of Roman technological accomplishments; the aqueduct. A must read for those who love ancient history or historical fiction.
6305313687|1.0|if we will ever have a movie exemplifying the racist attitudes of the people of Israel?  <br />The problem with this movie is it portrays ethnocentricism as a white pathology, which is completely contrary to what we find in this world.  How many people like Norton's character really exist in our modern world?  Very few.  If we are going to make a movie about ethnocentric behavior, the portrayal of an Israeli soldier would be much more relavent and believable. <br />Ultimately, this movie provides no insight to real life racist behavior.  It simply promotes the hollywood myth that egalitarianism is the normal human tendency, and only white people prefer their own race or tribe over others.  Meanwhile, the whole world is errupting in ethnic wars and indoctrinated Americans don't have a clue as to why.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I love this movie! it's a classic! the ending is so awsome...the slow motion ties ur stomach up in a knot and then it almost bursts when the climax happens! awsome! recommnded to any horror/drama/revenge movie fan! The &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD is awsome, it has great bonus features!!
B00005OWIU|5.0|While my daughter thought the music was &quot;spooky&quot; I have to say that this is my favorite music to listen to while I am working. It sets a mood of relaxation for me that nothing else (even Enya!) does. I am sure it has a lot to do with the atmosphere of Hogwarts. I enjoy the books, the movies and the music. John Williams is one of my favorites but this is my favorite work of his. I have HPCS as well but this one sets the mood best.
0385504209|5.0|I think the reviews of this book are almost as entertaining as the book itself, although they took a lot longer to read. This is an excellent pulling together of both fact and fiction. The factual aspects of the book, those that deal with the historical Jesus and the inner workings of the various churches and secret societies, are interesting enough to demand a read. Interwoven with it, however, is an enticing mystery story set in the modern world of politics and power. OPEN YOUR MIND when you read the book, and, if you choose, do your own research. The journey will be startling and very much worth it!
B00005JM02|5.0|The characters are cute -- down right adorable. The moral lessons are constant. One after the other. All good ones. Yeah for family! School is good. Pay attention. Love. Care for one another. Mutual support. Fish are friends not food! (Wait a second? This lesson from a shark?) I guess I was just prejudiced. Vegitarian sharks.<br />We loved this film. Ellen did a great job. The blue fish even looked like her.<br />Thank you for great work Pixar.

B00012QM8G|5.0|I have been waiting two years for Schlinder's List to be released. My VHS copy is a little worn. Some reviews say this is a movie to be viewed only once because of its subject matter. I personally think this movie should be shown in all middle school classrooms (along with Bowling for Columbine).  If you are ever down or depressed about something, just watch this movie and all your problems will seem petty compared to what these brave souls endured.  It really helps me/saddens me/humbles me to watch the movie and once viewed, it will never leave your mind.

0141301066|5.0|As a child, I loved all of Roald Dahl's books - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, etc. However, by far, my favorite is Matilda. I first read it over ten years ago when I was in fourth grade. I must have read it at least six times since then and it still, even as an adult, makes me laugh. It is a classic and a great book for children (and adults) of all ages:)!!
B00005JLXE|4.0|just watched the movie Daredevil two nights ago and can say that I'm very impressed with how good it was. I wasn't really looking forward to watching it after hearing how bad it was from so many people (and because it had Ben Affleck in it), but I soon found out how wrong they were after watching this film.<br />Daredevil is just very entertaining from start to finish. It has good acting from everyone in it, with some actors owning their roles and really impressing me. The story is told nicely and progresses very well throughout the film.<br />But with every good movie, there always has to be something bad in it. One thing that most fans of the comic are quick to point out is the fact that Kingpin was white in the comics, but is black in this movie. This didn't really bother me, seeing as how Michael Clarke Duncan is excellent in the role and also for the simple fact that I have never read the comic before. I also didn't like how the CGI and live action of the movie would constantly switch back and forth so quickly; it gets very annoying sometimes. Most of the problems here, though, are just minor details that most likely will not affect your view on the movie.<br />Overall, the good weight out the bad in this film, as it has to be one of the best superhero movies I've seen in awhile(YES, I even think it's better than X-Men, but not as good as X-2). Strongly recommended for both fans of the comics and fans of good movies.
B00014NE62|5.0|The years we have waited! I was in London in 2000, where I bought a British DVD release of \\"Maurice\\". Imagine my rude awakening when I returned to America and learned what a DVD region is! It made a nice gift for a friend back in London. But here it is, at long last, and I've ordered it immediately upon learning. I shall always remember where I was when Kennedy was shot; where I was on 9-11-2001; and I shall always remember my first viewing of \\"Maurice\\". The performances were so heartfelt, the cinematography so luscious, the detail of decor so exquisite, that there was nothing to do but go out the next day and buy the book. I finished it in two days, and in the years since have become the proud owner of a first edition. The poetry of the movie does not quite do justice to Forster's words: after all, how can a movie explain that blossoms, picked and dropped to the ground, \\"mourn from the ground like an expiring fire\\"? But hip, hip, hooray, the DVD is coming soon, and no one is happier about this than I! This movie should be required viewing for all gay men, at any age. Cheers and Bravo!
B00000IQC8|1.0|First off, I'd just like to say that I'm a huge fan of most of Kevin Smith's work and usually love every View Askew film, but there's something about Clerks that I just never liked. Perhaps it was the fact that the whole film is black and white, or maybe it's because the plot was pointless and dumb. Actually, most View Askew films have a dumb plot, but Kevin Smith usually always finds a way to make them funny. Smith failed here, because Clerks rarely made me laugh.<br />(*Small spoilers*)<br />The plot is about two Clerks named Dante and Randall who work in a convienince store. Randall can be funny at times, but it seems like Dante is just whiny throughout the whole film and really makes me despise this movie. Throughout the day, Dante and Randall basically just talk to each other about different topics, such as the dangers of working on the death star in Star Wars, Caitlin Bree (Dante's ex-girlfriend), and how Dante finds the customers to be annoying. The whole film is basically just two guys sitting behind a counter and rambling on about stuff that no one even cares about. I'm sorry, but I really have no idea how this film became so popular and why some consider it to be &quot;Groundbreaking&quot;.<br />Overall, I feel that there are far better View Askew films out there, mainly &quot;Mallrats&quot; being a favorite of mine.
B00005JKC3|2.0|A film by Ang Lee<br />After \\"The Ice Storm\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", I was looking forward to Ang Lee's next movie.  When I heard he was doing \\"The Hulk\\", I was excited because he is a gifted director who could potentially bring a fresh look to a comic book movie and I thought he could do a fantastic job.  The reviews started coming in, and they were negative, but I still wanted to see the movie, both as a comic book adaptation and as an Ang Lee film.  Maybe I would see something that the reviewers did not.  Unfortunately, I did not.  \\"The Hulk\\" is awful.<br />The movie begins with the necessary origins story.  While readers of the comic may be familiar with the origins of Hulk, the viewer needs to be introduced to how this all happened.  This is necessary, but it is also a drawback because it takes a half hour to tell.  This is a half hour of exposition where the title character does not make an appearance (though we are given hints and teases of what is to come).  Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) is a scientist who, because of an accident in his laboratory, is hit with Gamma radiation.  This causes Banner to turn into the Hulk when he gets angry, in part because of a lot of repressed memories of his father, David (Nick Nolte).  David Banner was also a scientist engaged in similar research and it is in part because of David's science that Bruce was affected the way he was.  Telling any more with spoil the revelation (if anyone cares).<br />Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) is also a scientist working with Bruce, and it is hinted that they had a past relationship, though they still obviously care for each other.  She becomes the damsel in distress, as well as the bait laid out by her father, General Ross (Sam Elliott).  When Bruce becomes the Hulk, the military gets involved (as well they should with a rampaging green creature about).  The real showdowns come between Hulk and the military, under the command of General Ross.<br />The first three quarters of the movie wasn't that good, but the last quarter just got downright ridiculous and silly, and nonsensical.  There was the whole side plot with Bruce's father that got pushed to the front and it didn't really make too much sense in conjunction with the rest of the plot, and that dragged down the movie to be even worse.<br />Part of the problem is simply the Hulk himself.  The CG Hulk was extremely well done, but it was all too easy to see that he isn't part of the environment.  Perhaps it was the bright green color, but unlike the X-Men, Hulk didn't seem real even as part of the movie.  It was too obvious that he was CG when everything else is real.  Plus, the movie was just a bit cheesy, and dull.<br />What I did like, and what I thought was done very well was the use of split screen frames, just like the comic book frames.  Sometimes they didn't seem to be used very well, but at other times, it added immensely to the movie and was one of the best features of the movie.  A couple scenes standout in my head, in the use of the split screens, but I'll leave it to the viewer to figure those out because revealing the scenes will spoil what the scene is about.<br />\\"The Hulk\\" should have been a better movie, but I was just disappointed.  Eric Bana was uninteresting as Bruce Banner, and with all the potential that there was, this was a complete let down.  Even \\"Daredevil\\" was a better movie with more human emotion.  Skip this one, even if you are a fan of Marvel Comics.e movie wasn't that good, but the last quarter just got downright ridiculous and silly, and nonsensical.

0679720200|1.0|If you are looking for a book to put you to sleep, look no further.  Here it is.  This is the most pathetic book I have ever read.  And not only was the book boring, the main character, Meursault, was an emotionless, hopless, and disgusting human being.  His views on women and relationships are no less than vile.  He does not even remorse over the death of his mother.  He then says that he no emotional attachment to Marie, the lady that he is sexually active with.  Thankfully, he commits a cold blooded murder and is put to death.  And at his execution, he says that he wishes there be \\"howls of execration.\\"  It is amazing to me that an individual can want there to be people cursing him on the day of his death.  Bottom line, this is not woth the time for you to sit down and read it.
B00005JMFO|4.0|This movie was a collection of short stories, all loosely connected and leaving you wondering \\"what happens next?\\". I saw it twice and loved it both times. It doesn't pretend to be terribly deep, but with a stellar cast you feel like the characters are genuine.  Billy Bob Thornton makes a great weasel (it's only a bit part, but boy, is he slimy!). I want to thank whoever cast it for putting all my favorite actors in one show.  The storyline involving the porn stand-ins is a little startling at first, but the irony of the situation makes it worthwhile. I thought all of the stories very plausible except the one involving the young man coming to America.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|What is the fascination with this movie. First of all, how can anyone sit and watch K. Reeves try to act? He is the most pathetic actor in Hollywood. He couldn't play a sleeping man if he was asleep. I mean he just sucks. His lines are as wooden as a peg leg, his range of emotions go from 0 to 0 in an hour and a half, and he's just not an interesting character. Let's face it, this 'Matrix' thing is supported by it's special effects, period. The plot, story, supporting cast, dialog, and acting are all sorry, but the special effects are good, go figure. This is a movie for 14 year old computer geeks who only talk to girls online.
0385508417|4.0|I read this for our Book Club, but I had read it a couple years ago when it first came out.  I think the second time I read it, I found it funnier than the first time.  It is a rather silly story line, but I think that is the point.  Has the commercialization of Christmas gone a bit too far?  I felt like I lived on this street and the street was on a sitcom.  I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was...a light read that in the in the end expressed what the spirit of Christmas SHOULD be about.

B00005JMFO|4.0|I went to Love, Actually with no expectations.  OR, I expected a trite, boring, sickly sweet love story, as Hollywood often delivers.<br />Sure, it's a Christmas movie, and at the end of the movie a couple \\"gets together\\" and it all looks like roses for them.  But Love, Actually has more than that.  In fact, there are many couples (eight?).  There are a variety of situations (just beginning to date, newlyweds, married for a long time, cheated on, starting over, etc.), and there are a number of outcomes.  <br />Some of Love, Actually is like a typical romantic comedy, but it's unlike most of the romantic comedies being produced today in that it presents romantic love in so many forms and situations.  The acting is fairly good, with Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Alan Rickman particularly sharp.  The intercutting stories seem to disturb or bother some viewers, but I thought it helped to keep the movie lively and moving along at a nice pace.<br />Eye candy abounds here as well, with the pleasing Hugh Grant and some ridiculously handsome guy (the object of Laura Linney's affection, though I can't remember his name) among the men, and Keira Knightley (surely among the most beautiful women in movies) among the women.  <br />There you go.  I usually avoid romantic comedies as if they were the plague.  Far from repuslive or boring, I found Love, Actually to be enjoyable, actually.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I watched this about 10 times within the first month.  As far as a concert performance goes, I have not seen anything more compelling or moving to watch.  One of the most eerie (if you will) components of this concert is the picture of George in his early Beatle days as the stage backdrop and Harrison's son Dhani playing in the concert.  Dhani is a dead ringer to his father's picture in the stage backdrop. It's like watching George playing in the concert.  Joe Brown's closing is classic.  This is a no brainer, just buy it.
B0000004V2|5.0|I'm SO stupid for discovering The Stone Roses for myself so late.  It's funny, I've been enjoying them even though I hadn't gotten into them until about 2 years ago.  I've already listened to them through Blur, the Verve, and Oasis--some of my favorite bands.  <br />Well, if you like amazing beats, beautiful harmonies and melodies, LOOK NO FURTHER.  Like me writing a review will add something that no one else here has...I still had to rave about this CD pseudo-publicly.  Every single song is 5 stars, but my favorite is the epic raver, &quot;Fool's Gold&quot; where I believe the BritPop boom chug chugga-a-chug chug beat originated.  The bass line popping in and out driving you mad...  I can't even form complete sentences writing about this CD.  Enjoy this CD for the masterpiece it is.  It's worth 10x what Amazon is charging.<br />To me, The Stone Roses is an original band; however, I'm surprised that I rarely hear anyone mention the Simon &amp; Garfunkel influences in their music.  Specifically, of course, &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot; which is the melody of &quot;Scarborough Faire&quot; (which really isn't technically a Simon &amp; Garfunkel original), but a little more abstractly, &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot;, which suggestively leads into &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot;.  Everytime I hear &quot;Bye Bye Badman&quot; I'm reminded of middle/early years Simon and Garfunkel harmonies and melodies.  This isn't alone the only influence I hear, but it is a strong one.<br />Long live The Stone Roses!!!
0688163173|5.0|This was such a well written and great story.  I typically don't have a lot of time to read, but I made time to finish this book in 2 days and couldn't wait to get into the office to pass it on to the next lucky ready.  Great book!
0316666343|4.0|I picked this book up at my library. It was on the sale shelf, and I usually grab any book that I might be slightly interested in. The title of this one was odd, so I thought I would give it a shot.<br />It was an enjoyable read. If you're the type of person that likes to read about a main character, then you probably wouldn't care for this. The story skips around a lot between all of the loved ones/friends that were left behind when Susie died. You ride a rollercoaster through the book to somehow end on a good note. I won't knock it, though; I'm a sucker for good endings.
0375751513|5.0|&quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is a classic novel suffused with intriguing philosophies along with discrete ethical lessons.  Oscar Wilde encorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture. The storyline is dynamic and captivating while the words play smooth and melodious.  &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is thought-provoking and certain to interest a variety of readers.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
0452279488|5.0|Starting the book, I didn't care much for Helen, but she grew on me. I realized how much our personalities were alike. She goes around being extremely charming and flirting with everyone while she is quite the opposite in truth. Only a select few people see her other side that is quite scalding at times, but comes and goes very quickly.<br />My favorite things about this book were the thoughts. The thoughts of Johnny and Helen were so wonderfully written that I often felt them becoming my own. I was in this story, not just reading it. And it read so easily! I love that very little scenery description was used. I didn't want to put this book down. The torture that was Johnny and Helen thinking about each other was fantastic.<br />The ending was a little lacking for me, however. It left me dangling there wishing there was yet another page because things didn't seem to come to a close.<br />All in all, it's a wonderful read. Interesting and sexy without the boredom of the run of the mill romance. I saw the movie based on the book before reading this, and I have to say that the book was a thousand times better.
B00009Y3L4|1.0|This great movie classic and several others by Bob Fosse are sold to the public in some of the lousiest DVD productions I've seen. There are hardly any extras, actually there are none, with the honorable exception of recently issued &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. The whole idea with DVD's is to offer consumers and movie lovers something they did not have on VHS. Benefits of DVD technology are conspicuously missing with this DVD and many others. That is the only reason I am giving Cabaret one star. The review posted here should assist customers with their purchase and since this is such a poor DVD package, I refuse to buy it. I suspect there will be re-issues in several years which only means more money out of your pocket - just because the product was not offered in proper production the first time arround. If this sounds like deja vu, you're right - remember all the &quot;remastered&quot; audio CD's that you have to buy all over again. Shame on the entertainment industry and their lousy products. They are fighting the piracy but inviting it with such behavior.<br />Max
0446677450|1.0|This is a great book if you want to be inspired to improve your financial situation.  It's a great book if you want to look closer at the school systems and what financial information if any is being taught there.  But if you want to be wealthy, I suggest you do not read this book.  This book is full of promises, but very little facts.  The author gives multiple examples of him making a lot of money, but doesn't explain the process.  When I finished reading this book, I was excited and ready to make a lot of money!  The only problem was that I still didn't know how.  <br />For example, the author states how he bought a $65,000 house for $20,000 and sold it for $40,000.  That's great!  But how exactly did he buy a $65,000 house for $20,000?  And where did this $20,000 come from?  He says you can buy a house without exchanging money, but he doesn't clearly say how.<br />The author tries to explain money lessons through his Rich Dad stories, but too often the lesson is a \\"you'll see\\" type of deal.  Although the author puts down traditional investing (mutual funds etc), I think that's the method I'll stick with.  It may not be as exciting as his, or reap as many financial rewards as he CLAIMS his does, but it's a formula that works for the average person.
0316666343|5.0|An excellent read...but it should make us all wonder...just who are the people in our neighbourhoods?
B00007KQA3|1.0|I was reading some of the reviews, how disappointing to hear that EURYTHMICS Soundtrack is not on this disc. They added that eerie element to this movie, and made me a fan of George Orwell. I guess I will stick with the VHS Version then. What kind of idiots at the DVD Company would drop out their &quot;sound&quot;?.. Wow!.. Surprising, yea, if I was Dave or Annie, I would be pissed... I mean Michael Radford's music was o.k., but Jeez, WELL I think they should come out with a NEW DVD of this awesome film WITH THE EURYTHMICS SOUNDTRACK!!!!!...
0679720200|3.0|This book was about a man who has a very negatvie out look on life. It starts out with Meursault attending his mother's funeral. His demeanor at the funeral concerns many of his mothers friends and later on in the book it comes back to haunt him. The day after Meursualt's mother's funeral the two go out for a fun day at the pool and movies. This also contributes to his downfall. Many events in this novel happen but necessarily dont need to. Most of the trouble in the book was brought on by Meursault. The people he asscociates himself with and the influence they have on him make this man more and more corrupt. Raymond, his neighbor, is the biggest person involved with his trouble. He gets Meausault into business he didnt even need to know. And when he attends a beach house with Raymond he does something he will regret, he kills a man. This one event destroys the life of Meursault and any hope he would have. He is condemned to die and spends endless nights in prison thinking of life outside the bars. I feel sorry for Meursault for the life he has lived even though he brought most of it on himself. This book was alright to read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read suspensful and ironic books.
B0000Z80HU|4.0|There are some albums that when you listen to them sounds as though they're trying to bust out of the two speakers they're confined to: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;SGT. Pepper&quot; and &quot;Sea Change&quot; all fit neatly into this category.  So this 5.1 mix would seem to be the perfect extension of the CD and it almost is.  The separation is excellent and I'm presuming that most people who buy DVD-Audio discs are buying them for the surround mixes and not because they are audiophiles with 96khz DVD-Audio players...I'm talking about the Dolby Digital section of the disc.  The thing I love the most about music in 5.1 is that it allows for so much space in the music instead of having the feeling that the two speakers in front are are &quot;packed,&quot; and this album certainly breathes a lot better in 6 speakers.  So the separation is great, but the effects are very sublte, especially after listening to the triumphant &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots 5.1,&quot; but this is a sublte record and restraint is necessary.  Still, there are a few key opportunities to swirl some effects around your head that are overlooked in favor of  keeping effects and texture in the rear and the main music confined to the front speakers, with the middle speaker, appropriately, underused.  This is not to say the mix isn't fantastic, because it is, the back speakers keep you submerged in noise and bleeps while the acoustic guitars and voices remain strong in the front and the LFE bass channel is ballsy.  A few times it seems as though Beck's vocals are bobbing in a sea that flows front to back, back and front and these moments are particularly effective. <br />Complaints are that, even though 6 of the songs offer videos with 5.1 mixes, in order to listen to the album in sequence the only visuals are the track list which is about the most disinteresting thing I can think of, the album cover on the screen for 50 minutes would be much more pleasing.  In addition, the tracks don't appear in the DVD display, so if you shut off your TV you can't tell what song is playing.  These are minor complaints, but you know, after being spoiled by the YOSHIMI disc I look at DVD-Audio in a whole other light...It would've been nice if Elliot S., Nigel G. or Beck himself had added some notes on the 5.1 mixes also, but we can't expect too much.<br />As an ending side note I would like to add that the 5.1 mix of this record led me straight back to the stereo mix to investigate the differences and I feel the need to comment on how great that original record was produced.  The 5.1 mix is really an extension of what Nigel Godrich was doing and a more enveloping stereo mix I've not often heard.
0385504209|3.0|In this book all the players are &quot;bad guys.&quot;  The troubling thing is that it makes you pull for one set of these bad guys as though they were &quot;good guys.&quot;  Otherwise fun to read and full of interesting historical data.  HOWEVER....the book IS fiction.  Don't let it mess with your faith.
B000089RVX|4.0|At first, like everyone else I judged this band on their success with &quot;Bring me back to life&quot;, but you can't truly appreciate this band until you hear the beautiful range that Amy's voice acheives.  True enough some of the songs in this album are steeped in dark themes but just give &quot;Immortal&quot; a chance and you can appreciate the beutiful writing evident here as well...very deep.
B00006AW2P|4.0|As everybody else has already noted, the Rolling Stones' first album has a great raw, aggresive bluesy sound to it and some fantastic renditions of rhytmn and blues songs. There are plenty of great songs on here, although it should be noted that all but one of them are covers.  No matter-they are fantastic.  This album embodies the Stones' rough, dangerous image back from the days when it was REAL and they actually meant it, as opposed to these days, when they are 60 something billionaires strutting around baseball stadiums pretending to be the angry rebels they were in the early 60's. <br />&quot;England's Newest Hitmakers&quot; is not, however, a perfect album, however.  A few clunkers (the instrumental &quot;Now I've Got A Witness&quot;, plus &quot;Can I Get a Witness&quot;, and &quot;You Can Make It If You Try&quot; come to mind) and the objective buyer should keep in mind the difference between the 5-star reviews of fans and the real deal on an album. I love this record, but it is definitely a far cry from &quot;Start Me Up&quot;, or STICKY FINGERS, or even &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. This is what the Stones were based on, what they played in clubs.  It's a worthwhile purchase, after you've gotten HOT ROCKS and BEGGARS BANQUET, LET IT BLEED, and other 60's Stones Records

B00005JLEU|5.0|MY 6 YR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THIS MOVIE! WE GIVE THIS MOVIE TWO THUMBS UP ALL THE WAY!  SHE HAD SOME FRIENDS OVER A FEW WEEKS AGO AND AFTER WATCHING IT AT OUR HOUSE, THEY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ONE FOR THEMSELVES.  IT IS WELL WORTH WATCHING AND THE ADULTS WILL LOVE IT TOO.  I KNOW I SURE DID!  WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Outstanding series, best sci-fi on TV in decades. DVD set is outstanding, presented in widescreen - great picture quality and good sound. Extras are nice; insight into the making (and future?) was entertaining and enlightening. Excellent pick, I've watched them twice already. <br />By way of reference, I'm not a typical sci-fi geek. The only other TV show I have ever justified buying was HBO's &quot;A Band of Brothers&quot; series. Of the sci-fi movies I own, I have one star trek movie (a gift from someone), the first matrix movie, and the first x-men movie. I'm not a sci-fi buff, not a western buff, and generally not a consumer of this type of media (I prefer books). And if you ask me, Firefly is a must-have for your collection if you're at all interested in sci-fi, movie making, westerns (and I'm not a fan of westerns), or generally just want to kill an hour every now and again. <br />Awesome. Fun stuff.
B00005T7I1|4.0|Here she is again, folks: Madonna in yet another feature film. This time, she plays the villainess, Breathless Mahoney, a nightclub singer, who now works for Big Boy Caprice (played by the legendary Al Pacino).<br />    Warren Beatty, Madonna's latest real life flame at the time, is in the role of ole Dick himself. Dick is in a relationship with Tess Trueheart, but Tess doesn't know how true this love for Dick is. Dick has been after Big Boy Caprice for quite some time. While on his way home from a long day, Dick runs into The Kid. He picks him and let's him stay awhile while he can find an orphange for The Kid to stay in. <br />    Madonna plays Breathless Mahoney, the villainess who works for Big Boy Caprice. Despite the fact she works for his enemy, Breathless falls madly in love with Dick, which puts Dick and Tess' relationship to the test: Will Dick choose Breathless or Tess? <br />    A pretty far-fetched film, but still quite enjoyable. Warren Beatty may have been great in the role of Dick Tracy, but the way I look at, it was really Madonna's performance as Breathless Mahoney and Al Pacino's performance as Big Boy Caprice that steal the spotlight of the show.
B000004286|5.0|My hat's off to James Horner.  His soundtrack for this incredible movie does both the world of movie soundtracks and Scottish folk music great justice.  I watched the movie last night and now have the soundtrack playing on iTunes at work.<br />I am a very huge fan of Horner's work thanks to Titanic and Apollo 13.  Add Braveheart to the list.
B00005T7HG|3.0|Madonna has finally gotten the role that she said herself was born to play: Evita. This film is an up-dated movie-musical version of the broadway musical, Evita.<br />    Madonna is in the role of Eva &quot;Evita&quot; Peron, who rose from poverty to riches and fame. Eva lived a life so perfect, so sublime, it seemed to good to be true. Until she became diagnosed with uterary cancer. She passed away on July 26, 1952, leaving her nation heartbroken.<br />    Madonna was incredibly outstanding in this role. This was a role that was made only for Madonna and nobody else. They could've picked the best actress in the world and that actress still wouldn't come close to Madonna's performance. But the movie itself wasn't what I had expected. I was thinking this would be a movie with dialogue. I didn't expect to me a movie that was a musical. That's why I gave it three stars instead of five. Still, Madonna delivers another one of her best performances. Her rendition of Don't Cry For Me Argentina is nothing less than beautiful. I think her rendition of the song is the best one around.<br />    If you haven't seen this film, please be my guest and see it. I don't know what the rest of you will think, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much.
B00003CX95|5.0|Last night I saw Braveheart for the first time. Instead of the watered-down &quot;safe to watch&quot; TV version, I went for the all-out DVD, complete with blood and gore. I was NOT disappointed. The story of William Wallace and how his legacy rallied the Scots to fight for and earn their freedom is very gripping. While the movie is about 3 hours long (and I had the luxury of a pause button), this is one of those movies where you don't want to get out of your seat until it's over (Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is another). I would definitely recommend this movie and I would also recommend looking for more about William Wallace.
6300271439|5.0|Madonna has shown us that she has a true talent in being a singer, with the release of three amazing albums, Madonna (1983), Like A Virgin (1984), and True Blue (1986). She then showed us that she has a true talent as an actress, where she starred in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) and Shanghai Surprise (1986). This spunky comedy is a must-have movie, where Madonna explores the depths of comedy.<br />    Madonna plays Nicole &quot;Nikki&quot; Finn, a free-spirited girl who enjoys life to the fullest extent. In 1983, Nikki was arrested for the murder of her boyfriend. However, Nikki did not committ the crime. Her boyfriend, Johnny, oversaw a particular meeting going on between an unidentified man and a pimp named Raoul. Johnny gets the goods on this guy: photos, tapes, etc. He locks all if that stuff in the indentified man's saftey deposit box and gives Nikki the key. The unidentified man hires Raoul and some fat guy to kill Johnny. The two put his corpse in the trunk of Nikki's car. She gets in the car, takes a red light and is pulled over. The cops open up her trunk, and there's Johnny's dead body. Four years later, Nikki is granted parolle.<br />    Griffen Dunne plays Loudon Trott, a tax attorney, who is one day from marrying the daughter, Wendy Worthington, of his boss, Mr. Worthington. His boss gets a call about Nikki being granted her parolle. She was asked to leave New York and take the bus to Philadelphia. Mr. Worthington wants Loudon to drive Nikki to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus to Philly. Instead of letting him take her, Nikki takes Loudon on  wild goose chase to clear her name before she returns to Philly. Her craziness has everyone around her asking, &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;.<br />    Featuring a killer soundtrack, which includes four songs from Madonna (Causing A Commotion, The Look Of Love, Can't Stop, and the hit title track, Who's That Girl), Who's That Girl is a downright hilarious movie and will have you watching it over and over again. If you buy this movie, you sure as hell will be watching it over and over again.
B000065RMP|5.0|'Agaetis Byrjun' is pure art, unlike most music released these days. Its innate beauty stuns at first listen and purely delights and sooths every listen thereafter. This album is unlike what most people have never considered possible, much less listened to. This, however, shouldn't daunt a prospective listener. Even if one does not enjoy this music (which I think is possible yet not common), one can appreciate the subtlety of Sigur Rós and their musical abilities.<br />My favorite song on 'Agaetis Byrjun' is 'Vidrar Vil tel Loftarasa' which is Icelandic (as is sung the album) for 'nice dau for an air raid'. It's mood is unlike any other I've felt in my large and diverse collection of music. Its corresponding video is touching, for both obvious and personal reasons. <br />On that note, I also recommend the Sigur 1/Sigur 9 single, not so much for the music CD than for the included DVD containing the breathtaking videos for 'Svefn-G-Englar', the abovementioned 'Vidrar Vil tel Loftarasa' from 'Agaetis Byrjun' and 'Untitled #1'  from Sigur Rós' untitled following to 'Agaetis Burjun'<BR> <BR>This album is definately a necessity for music-lovers young and old.
B00004X01U|5.0|In 2000, Madonna released her twelfth album entitled, MUSIC. This album is totally different than RAY OF LIGHT, for this album features the sound of futuristic techno of the millennium, the sound you would hear in dance clubs, since the start of the 21st century. This album is extremely amazing, where Madonna had recruited producer Mirwais Ahmadzai. Not only did Madonna reinvent her sound once again, she reinvented her style once again, taking up the millennium urban cowgirl pimpette look. Read on for the info. <br /> <br />MUSIC <br />  The first single from the album. When I saw the video for this single on MTV, I was in deep amazement. The video is one of Madonna's best. The animated scene in the video was not meant to be animated, for Madonna was supposed to have acted out the scene. But Madonna was actually five or six months pregnant with her son, Rocco (shockingly, she hid it very very very well). The director went to her with the idea of having the scene animated, and Madonna immediately agreed to it, for she said that she always wanted to see herself animated. Great music video. <br /> <br />IMPRESSIVE INSTANT <br />  I wish this energy-filled dance tune was released a single. This is a great song all the way. <br /> <br />RUNAWAY LOVER <br />  This is one of two songs that was not produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai, but by RAY OF LIGHT producer, William Orbit. This is a great dance tune. <br /> <br />I DESERVE <br />  The first of three country-western tunes. This great song is Madonna's dedication to her husband, Guy Ritchie. <br /> <br />AMAZING <br />  The second of the two songs to be produced by William Orbit, not Mirwais Ahmadzai. Great song. <br /> <br />NOBODY'S PERFECT <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />DON'T TELL ME <br />  The second single from the album. This is the second country-western song. This is a great song. It's simply another Madonna classic. Great song. <br /> <br />WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL <br />  The third & final single from thealbum. This was Madonna's third music video to be banned from MTV and VH1 (the first two being \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Erotica\\"). This time, the video wasn't banned because of sexuality, but because of violence, a side of Madonna no one has ever seen before. The song is about how we men are always doing certain things and getting away with it because we're men, but how when women do the same thing, they're always in trouble for it. It's sort of like we men feel intimidated when a woman pulls a the same stunt a man has already done. Because of the meaning of this song, Madonna used the \\"Above & Beyond 12\\" Club Mix\\" of the song, so the meaning would fit the music video more, where in the video, Madonna and her elderly grandmother sit in Madonna's car, while Madonna rams hockey players, uses taiser on men at a MAC machine, shoots water into cops' faces, steals another guy's car, blows up a gas station. This is a great song. <br /> <br />PARADISE (NOT FOR ME) <br />  Great. <br /> <br />GONE <br />  Not only the last song on the album, but the third and final country-western song on the album. Great song. <br /> <br />    This is another one of Madonna's greatest pieces of work. This album is a true work of art, and all Madonna fans should already have this album. Just remember that, \\"...Music makes the people come together. Music makes the bourgoisie and the rebel...\\"
B00005JMCW|5.0|Sorry, but it really is. It's accomplishes everything it sets out to do. Make you laugh, make you cry, make you have fun, it does it. I saw everything last year from 'American Splendor' to 'Return of the King' and if I had to sit thru anything again it would be 'Freaky Friday'. This is movie perfection.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I can't recommend this DVD strongly enough, epecially if you're a Pink Floyd fan, but it's not a requirement for enjoyment. <br />Originally produced as an entry into VH-1's Classic Albums series, it gives a fascinating backstage look at the conception and execution of one of the most important rock albums ever made, as told by all the members of the band as well as supporting crew such as cover designer Storm Thorgerson and engineer Alan Parsons. Considering the antagonistic relationship they have had with each other since thier breakup after 1980's The Final Cut, the four members talk remarkably civil about each other's contributions to the work, sometimes even with admiration. What's best, though, are the little musical performances the members give while describing the work, highlighting certain favourite parts of the album, particularly by Gilmour who seems even now to be able to reproduce pitch-perfect musical examples. <br />A terrific revisiting of a colossal musical achievment.
B0000U0X1G|3.0|Its always easy to put down these types of movies but, it is what it is,a good action flick. I liked the stars in it and of course the action scenes. Basically the S.W.A.T team has to be re-formed with some wildcats who take no bull from nobody while drinking hard and spitting fire and bullets. They strap it up one day to haul a madman across state lines to the goverment. But the dude lights em up with a offer of 100 million to any badass who busts a move and sets him free. So they end up fighting dirty cops , gangs , street punks and even former S.W.A.T. as they roll big time toward thier target.  L.A. is left in a burning shambles as they blow-up, shoot-up and kick -down every thing in thier path to get the job done. highly energetic is this movie and by the end your eyes will be worn out at all the explosions, in fact, somtimes the dialog was drowned out by so much stuff blowing up. Finally, they hurl us toward the ending with burning jets, cars, and even some trains as the drained viewer slides limp down in his seat.
0385473788|5.0|This book is a moving, timeless masterpiece that will still be powerful a hundred years from now. The end of the book is very painful and sad to read, because most if not all who read it already know how the story ends - Anne's death.<br />Even though Anne's father Otto removed intensely personal information in Anne's diary prior to publication, the book is still a painfully personal read about a young girl's dreams, hopes and aspirations in the face of Nazi brutality.<br />This book should be required reading for every American high school student, no matter the school, public or private. Anne Frank serves as a tremendous account and testament to the human spirit, even in the worst of times. It's a must read for not only students of World War II, but every person - to fully appreciate what a blessing life is.
B00004W221|5.0|This is one of the best inspirational movies ever. I love true stories and this is one of my favorites.It's about a young man (Sean Astin) chasing down a dream of playing Notre Dame football, and nothing is going to get in his way,NOTHING. It shows you can overcome any obstacle if you put your mind to it , and rudy does just that.<BR>   This movie will put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, and touches the hearts and souls of everyone.You'll never get tired of this one. A must see.
079073639X|5.0|I think it can be pointless to compare the movie to the book, in all cases, because they're two different pieces of work. The movie is &quot;based' off the book almost always; it isn't an exact representation, and how could it be? Reading a book is an entirely different experience than watching a movie. The book is amazing. So is the movie, in my opinion. I thought the cast and the acting was stellar, and I was always enthralled and caught in suspense. I think the ending is beautiful, not anticlimactic. Why does the ending of a science fiction thriller always have to be a huge climax? This is a unique ending that wraps everything up in a very simple way. This will always be one of my favorite movies.
B00008PW2D|1.0|Sex and the City started out as a grounbreaking series several years ago, but as the seasons advanced the writers ran out of topics about sex women could talk about, so they have thrown in drastically altered characters from pregnancy to marriage and divorce in these women who were supposed to represent single women.  This is sort of a \\"you have to live with the consequences\\" thing the writers who are probably male threw in.  Watching this show is like being stabbed with a fork in the eye repeatdly.  They ruined it.
B00004Z459|1.0|YES I ADMIT IT I USED TO LISTEN TO LINKIN PARK!!!!! I used to call this stuff....great. Then I found some good music and slowly started to see what this actually is...and that is crap! For me the cd that changed my tastes for the better was Laterlus by Tool. After that I went in search of cds that were actually good. Through this search I came up with great stuff like Ozzy, Nothingface...etc. After you begin to branch out alittle you will realize just how stupid and repatative this movie really is.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on the radio where I work, I imediately fell in love with it.  After hearing snippits from the other songs on the album, I decided to take a chance and buy the &quot;Fallen&quot; CD.  After the first few tracks, I was in love all over again.  The music is heavy but not too heavy, and the lyrics are true poetry.  Evanescence has perfectly captured the power and emotions that I was attempting to manifest with my own music and songs.<BR>Evanescene's style is a bit moody, but that's something any other true artist can quickly overlook, maybe not even account.  Amy Lee's vocals are a refreshing change from the whole pop-diva noise we've been getting lately (i.e. Brittany Spears).  And though some of the songs are a bit on the sad side (My Immortal), you can't deny their sheer beauty and elegance.<BR>The short of it, this is a must have for any other aspiring artist.  Musicians will love it for the heavy guitar riffs and the emotional strings, and singer/songwriters will love it for Amy Lee's haunting voice and expressivly poetic lyrics.  With yours truly, it's a win-win.
0780624890|5.0|This movie combines all the best qualities from horror and action films! You got the gore of a slasher film and the action of the matrix (without all of the overdone camera pauses). Theres also the great burning of an incredibly obese vampire. It'd looked like you could stick your head in its belly button!!! Just AWSOME!!!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia's 2nd cd displays her growth as an artist and as a woman. I enjoyed her debut cd, but this is (in my opinion) better by far. Favorite tracks: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11.<BR>Intelligent, sexy and assertive. Worth the bucks.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|This movie is awsome. It actually managed to have even more action than the original. But with more action it has a slightly weaker storyline. Although I don't think people watch these movies for the plot. I personally watch it for the blood gore and violence which this movie definatly has. In the first scence you see blood splater all over the wall. Nomad really can bite these suckers!!!! YEAH!!
B000077VR3|4.0|I didn't think I was going to like a musical such as this but when I watched it, I fell in LOVE! The costumes are precise and absolutely gorgeous, and Nicole and Ewan sang wonderfully enough so that I have both soundtracks. This movie set in this time frame holds true to a Baz Lurhman film, and the DVD has even more to make you love it. I recommend this to ANYONE even if you think you may not like it..you never know you may love it like I do.
B00004RFFW|5.0|Although this one does not start out [like] the first movie it still has a good beggining that sucks you right in. But don't wrry just because there arn't [bosoms] in the beginging doesn't mean they wont show up later in the film. There is even more action in this film in the origial and Joe Peci was a great addition to it. \\"whatever you want Leo Getz! you get it?\\" classic.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Everyone knows I'm like, the BIGGEST LOTR fan in this little stupid town. Everyone knows that I can listen to the first LOTR cd and tell you exactly where in the film it came from (I can even say the dialogue that the characters are saying during the song, and I do really good imitations!)...that WAS the only cd i had. Well, my family was opening presents on Christmas Eve, and I opened a package with some pajamas in it. I unfolded the pajamas, and out came... LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING SOUNDTRACK!!!! I was all like YAAAAAY!!! and I started crying... then later I was listening to &quot;Into the West&quot; by Annie Lennox... and I started bawling!!! Well, four days later I made my boifriend take me to the cinema to see LOTR:TROTK and I made him sit through the credits while I sang it... I'd known the words by heart eversince the first day I got it! And I was bawling during the whole last half hour of the movie... It's sooo sad!!! But... this last (*sniffsniffle*) soundtrack is the best. &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; needs to be turned on full blast to hear Billy Boyd(aka Pippin)'s solo, but turn it down as soon as he's done, cuz then the musak for the Witch-King's stronghold comes on like full blat and I went almost deaf!!!<BR>But really, It's a great cd. Write me! elnirnaeth@yahoo.com<BR>(It means &quot;Star-tears&quot; in Elvish.)
B00013F35I|5.0|Well the DVD I have has great sound quality, the editing is excellent and the band really rock.  This is the rock DVD of 2003.
0634049011|5.0|I entered musicians intstitute as a level 2 git student.  I soon realized that I was way behind.  I knew I was in trouble, so I bought this book, and in a matter of days I was able to understand what I should have already known...This book saved my ass and alot of money!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show really didn't get the chance to prove itself--So many people I talk to haven't heard of it! PLEASE GIVE IT A CHANCE! It's so worth it.<br />The characters are genuine, the chemistry between them is a tangible thing. The writing is GOLDEN--Joss Whedon strikes again! Witty and touching--I love his writing. I could always tell which eps of Buffy he'd written :D<br />You won't regret owning this one!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I don't what the people below are talking about.  I dont really have too much to say except buy this CD it is actually quite good.
6304493681|5.0|Like many other reviews about Ghost In The Shell, I highly recommend this movie.  I have had this movie for quite a while, and what has compelled me to write a review is the recent innovations in technology...especially biomedical engineering.  Current research in neuroscience, Electoactive Polymers (plastic muscles), nano-technoloy, flexible electroluminescent panels (could make skin the new light bulb), and replicators (printers that make 3 dimensional objects out of plastics....now some are experimenting with live cultured human cells in hopes to build a new organ (they've already made an ear)) is the science fiction of this movie.  <br />Ghost in the shell is a powerful movie for those who know what is possible in today's revolutionary merging of man and machine.  Our electrical signals generated in our brains and body are currently being deciphered as a code which is very similar to the 1s and 0s the computer uses you are working on right now.  Soon, with respect to historical timelines, our lives just might be parallel to that of this movie.<br />Stylistically this movie is sharp, interesting and familiar to most anime fans.  I first saw this movie over seven years ago and was amazed.  Now I occasionally view it and reflect on the technology around me, my colleagues (teachers and scientists), and my students.  Those students will be the scientists who make the subject matter in this movie a reality.  <br />Get the movie and think.
B0000TB050|4.0|FINALLY!  Music DVD producers are getting the formula right - Widescreen 16:9 and DTS!!!!  That's what they should ALL be.  PERIOD!<br />O.K., with that said...this is a very nice package.  I got mine from Best Buy for $15.99.  The redone &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; documentary is worth the price of admission alone.<br />The audio is very good (not stellar).  Very hot mix.  About the same dB level at &quot;55&quot; volume on my system as others at &quot;60&quot; volume.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Whoever says this is a dull album obviously doesn't have a musical bone in their body.  This is a life-altering deeply emotional album with gorgeous and unusual melodies.  The Revealling lyrics and Intense music are Pure Madonna.  I haven't gotten tired of it yet and I've been listening to it non-stop!!  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who has an ounce of good musical taste and some soul.
0792833236|2.0|The truth be told, Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull stands up there in the ranks of Kubrick's cinematography style. The editing and acting are all unique and extremely genuine. Shot in black and white you will see De Niro dance around the ring as Jake LaMotta scoring blows in some remarkably realistic performing. A press photographer's bulb flashes, an eye gets cut, blood squirts out, the crowd roar, the commentator goes wild, another bulb flashes, a slow motion sequence, De Niro utters some fantastic lines in the middle of a bout, then does it all again. At home he has issues about infidelity and he has some very punishing personality problems to boot. It makes for an interesting character study to see how the beast behind the gloves works out his problems in the ring and even expresses his disdain for it all in there too.<br />However this film does have some extremely negative values that batter the quality of this film about the place. The plot outside of the ring is mostly about LaMotta's emotional problems that end up turning violent. After awhile it seems that LaMotta is just a brutal man who Mike Tyson has taken some lessons from. It might be true to life, it might be realistic, but it is just plainly disinteresting and you want to see LaMotta beat up his wife and friends as much as you want to see some domestic violence in your own home. It doesn't make for very pleasurable viewing and certainly you can say - \\"But this is drama\\" and in many ways it is, but that is all Scorsese really explores here and after awhile you do get bored of it all and you don't really take anything much of value away with you after seeing it.<br />Surprisingly this is one of Scorsese's turkeys on the drama front. It never really develops into much and sometimes just appears to be there as an excuse for excessive profanity and violence. Nowhere does Scorsese's pictures come closer to being fowl-mouthed for the sake of it than in Raging Bull. At times you feel that this is why he made the picture in the first place, to see if he could push the standards of cursing in movies and allow the language to become acceptable as part and parcel of reality, but it really doesn't do anything for the picture or the character development. It just seems to be there - to be there. The film also stalls a lot of the time and in many ways those who say that they did not like Raging Bull have good reason too. It is an over-rated picture but not on the cinematography front or De Niro's performance. It is just not that well executed in the \\"song and dance\\" department and LeMotta's family and social life is just not really worthy of capturing on film any more than the drunken hobo who goes ape on anyone who comes near him because he is drunk with anger and feels exploited by society.<br />Scorsese certainly showed his value as a technical director with this one but it is hard to imagine that the maker of Taxi Driver or Goodfellas was behind the drama here. This is well below what Scorsese is capable off.the picture in the first place, to see if he could push the standards of cursing in movies and allow the language to become acceptable as part and parcel of reality, but it really doesn't do anything for the picture or the character development.

0375703861|4.0|Zadie Smith's remarkable debut novel shows depth, wit, and most of all, a genuine talent for storytelling.  She tackles an important but somewhat timeworn theme--the immigrant experience and all the culture clashes it produces--and turns it into something original and memorable.  Smith's ability to weave her characters' personal histories back and forth in time with such ease and aplomb proves that she is clearly a young writer to watch.  Archie and Samaad, the two anti-heroes of the story, are flawed and at times, foolish men, but Smith portrays these characters with so much affection and gentle mockery that one cannot help but love them.  This book crosses oceans, continents, and several generations, yet it never feels overblown or remote.  Smith has an uncanny writer's gift of inviting the reader into the narrative with such intimacy that the obscure becomes the familiar.  White Teeth has verve, wit, and panache.  Smith's talent is formidable.

B00005JMCN|5.0|Great movie, all the right touches of the history of three men and a horse that stirred the nation. Narration by David McCullough a nice touch. Interwoven story line moved fluently with the right music in the right places. Haven't seen this great a movie in years.  Too good for an Oscar and Peoples Choice Awards. I watch it almost every night--there is nothing to compare to what is on TV.

B0000DD7NL|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I was not too taken with Ms. Keys first effort. I forced myself to listen to Songs in A Minor on several occasions. Each time I couldn't wait for the CD to end. Being well aware of the sophomore jinx, I expected a lesser effort on the new work. What a pleasant surprise to hear singing and playing that reminded me of the R&amp;B of my youth. It is very clear that Ms. Keys has spent some time listening to '60s and '70s era LPs. Perhaps the term &quot;listen to&quot; isn't correct. Alicia has absorbed the spirit of two of the best decades in Black music. Not only does she &quot;get it&quot;, she also has the ability to convey it. <BR>In a period where Hip Hop music tends to dominate many aspects of the culture including record charts, the term crossover hit has lost much or its traditional meaning. Ms. Keys, in the Diary of Alicia Keys, has crossed over in a less traditional sense. She has created a work that crosses generational boundaries. Ms. Keys is on the leading edge of a return to smooth melodies and lyricism movement.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|You get real weird reviews here. Somebody said they hoped Britney's marriage would last forever. Dream on!

I love the ending!)<BR>The hook up - 10/10 (I do not know why ppl call this a weak track. This is the one of the catchiest songs I've heard!)<BR>Shadow - 11/10 (Finally a ballad. Shows the ppl who said Britney can't sing that she can for sure!)<BR>Brave New girl - 10/10 (she sounds so much like Madonna on this one. It's very funky and cool!)<br />Everytime - 13/10 (The loveliest ballad i've heard ever!)<BR>MATM RRDKmix - 10/10 (better than the original.)<br />Overall - 9.5/10<BR>This is not Britney's best album. I'd stick with Oops, then Britney and then this. <BR>I suggest you to buy it if you haven't. It's a lotta fun and I play it when my mum is scolding me so that I won't get angry or sad(lol!) That's a pointless bit of information but anyway what isn't pointless is buying this amazing CD!
B000059HAI|5.0|I first saw Tora! Tora! Tora! (Tiger! Tiger! Tiger! in Japanese) in 1974, when I was 20 years old on Atlanta's Channel Two. As strange as this may sound, I have always liked movies about World War II. My stepfather had served in the Navy during the war and in fact he had joined the service shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which is the subject of this 2 hour and 25 minute-long Japanese-American 1970 production. <br />This movie was directed by several directors including Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasuka, but the American version (yes, there is a Japanese version) gives the credit to veteran director Richard Fleischer. Based on Gordon W. Prange's &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and Ladislas Farago's  &quot;The Broken Seal&quot;, the film accurately depicts the events on both sides of the Pacific leading up to the stunning attack on the U.S. Pacific Fleet on Sunday, December 7, 1941. <BR>Even though it covers an 18-month period between Admiral Yamamoto's (Soh Yamamura) initial planning for Operation Hawaii and the attack itself, Tora! Tora! Tora! (the title refers to the code used to inform the Japanese that the Americans had been caught by surprise) never drags or seems dull. I learned, for instance, that Japanese Ambassador Nomura was a skilled and honorable diplomat who did not know what his country's military leaders were planning, and that he hoped to avoid war. I was also stunned by how General Walter C. Short (Jason Robards) was so preoccupied by the threat of sabotage from Hawaii's 125,000 Japanese inhabitants that he foolishly parked all the bombers and fighters in Hickam and Wheeler Fields in neat rows, supposedly to make them easier to guard but actually making them sitting ducks. <BR>What amazed me about watching this movie is how clueless Pearl Harbor's defenders were on that Sunday morning. Though many people think the first shot of the Pacific War was fired by the Japanese, it was actually fired by the USS Ward on a Japanese midget submarine trying to sneak into the harbor. This happened roughly an hour before the first bomb fell on Battleship Row. I would have thought that the report of an unknown submarine being fired upon in a restricted area would have alerted the whole fleet. Wrong! American officers in Oahu were so certain that the Japanese would be spotted long before they could launch a strike that Captain James Earle (Richard Anderson) asks for confirmation before he tells his superiors. This does not make Adm. Husband E. Kimmel (Martin Balsam) very happy and I thought he was very angry that the Ward's initial report did not reach him in time.<BR>The movie makes clear to the audience that history often hinges on small but significant details. Who would have thought that the fate of two great nations would be decided by a diplomat's slow typing speed, or that a report of a large radar blip off to the north of Oahu would be received with the phrase, &quot;Well, don't worry about it.&quot;? It sounds like bad fiction but everything in this movie is based on historical fact. <BR>Tora! Tora! Tora! has incredible battle scenes. Most of the aerial scenes were shot using either vintage planes or realistic replicas (because there are no flying Zero fighters, T-28 Texans were modified to look like the famous Japanese planes). The Navy actually allowed 20th Century-Fox to film in and around Pearl Harbor and rented a World War II era carrier that was to be decommissioned to serve as a stand in for the Japanese carrier. Clever editing, good miniature effects and carefully built live action sets give the illusion that one is actually reliving the Day of Infamy. <BR>The 60th Anniversary Special Edition DVD was released around the same time as 2001's Pearl Harbor. It features an all new 20-minute documentary, director's commentary, the orginal theatrical trailer, and restores the movie to its original widescreen format. It has four audio tracks (English 4.1, the commentary, English Dolby Surround, French Mono), and subtitles in English and Spanish.
B000002KKC|4.0|After major success from their &quot;Rumours&quot; album, one may be wondering this: &quot;What can we do to top THIS?&quot;  The answer, &quot;let's do an 'experimental album' and change some things that noboby would expect.&quot;  While there is nothing wrong with that thought, the execution WAS the concern for the fan.  Some fans will like it, some will not, and some will have mixed feelings.  I feel in the latter because I do have &quot;mixed feelings&quot; about this.<br />Obviously, Lindsey Buckingham had lots of leeway of what should be done and what songs should be on the album.  For the record, &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Tusk&quot;, and &quot;Think About Me&quot; were Top 20 hits.<BR>The album sold well, but not what they thought.  In 1979, other notable bands like The Bee Gees and The Eagles were having similar problems.  They also had mammoth albums and struggled to find excellent material for their next album.  <br />Overall, it's ok but at least it is something different.  I won't say, &quot;Don't buy it&quot;.  But maybe you will want to borrow this album from someone first before you buy it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I'm upset that only one star is the lowest possible rating.  This CD is garbage.  Pure crap.  You would still be getting ripped off if you purchased it from a pawn shop.
B000002KD5|5.0|Besides the album &quot;Rumours&quot;, I listen to this album the most from Fleetwood Mac.  The songs are very enjoyable in my opinion.  &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)&quot;, and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; were Top 20 hits.  However, &quot;Landslide&quot; is my personal favorite.<br />As stated in my title, this is NOT Fleetwood Mac's first album.  Rather, it was the beginning of Fleetwood Mac's SECOND &quot;fertile era&quot;!  We need more bands like Fleetwood Mac today!
B000001ELL|5.0|This album has all four members bumping it up on all four cylinders.Enjoyable dirty down Kiss from beginning to end. Of Special note is Save your love and especially the best Peter Criss Kiss tune Dirty Livin.
B000002KGT|5.0|I have played this album countless times and I never get sick of it.  If you are a fan, then you probably feel the same too!  I'm glad &quot;Silver Springs&quot; was finally released because it should have made it on the album in the first place!  I understand the politics sometimes; after all if you have &quot;creative control&quot;, then you will know if it belongs on the album or not!<br />If you are a casual fan that has their greatest hits album, and you are looking for something else, then get this album!  You will enjoy the hits along with &quot;The Chain&quot;.<br />This is one of the most essential albums of the 1970's along with Carole King's &quot;Tapestry&quot;, and the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack.
B0000024UO|1.0|this is one work of Johnny's that is better left forgotten.<BR>The songs are boring at best and will give you a mighty hankering for some rock &amp; roll!
B000002LFZ|5.0|Before their box set and recent &quot;Very Best Of...&quot;, this was the best hits collection from Fleetwood Mac.  You can't argue what's here because everything is pertinent if you are a casual fan.  However, if you are a fan, you may be disappointed that a certain song was not included.  I felt &quot;Silver Springs&quot; should have been included along with &quot;Think About Me&quot; and &quot;Love In Store&quot;.  There was room for those tracks.  But I do give it 5 stars because almost everybody will like this collection.<br />The liner notes are entertaining (it is about the band getting ready to perform).  The notes are right: these people were MEANT to be in the band.  I'm happy for their recent album success because we need more band like Fleetwood Mac.
B000001ELF|5.0|This lp shows that the master in Kiss was really Ace. The songs are sublime&gt; the only hit from the solos was the Groove. OH people must understand Kiss is nothing without the Space man.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is an excellent band and the collection here speaks for itself!  You can't argue what's here, but maybe what's NOT!  The 1990 hit &quot;Save Me&quot; is not here nor the studio version of &quot;Big Love&quot;.  I like the live track, but for the casual fan, they may prefer the radio hit version.<br />The packaging is superb with pictures and liner notes.  For the casual fan that is not sure about buying it because it is a double-disc collection, then try their 1988 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; single disc album.  Either way, you won't go wrong.<br />Now that Fleetwood Mac's recent album was successful, I'm already looking forward to their next album.  Believe me, we need MORE bands like Fleetwood Mac.

0385504209|3.0|The ideas posed by The Da Vinci Code are new to me, but as I research now I see they have been around for some time.  Dan Brown does a good job bringing these ideas into the mainstream and gives us all a little more to ponder when it comes to religion and just what we believe.<br />The plot, however, motivated me to look elsewhere for a better thriller.  Elmore Leonard and James Patterson have taken care of the for me.  The beginning of the book starts out very cliche with the phone ringing and waking up the main charachter.  Maybe if it started with Langdon tracing the medallions on his way to the Louvre to meet with Sauniere not knowing he had been killed already.  But it wasn't until he got to the Louvre is when I considered the story to actually begin.  Some people may think that the story takes a break-neck pace or a non-stop plunge into the grail quest it is, but I thought the story just drug whenever any of the characters would recall something in the past.  I realize that the reminiscing was essential to the different plot threads, but maybe he could have done it in a more of an explanation method instead of the &quot;I remember when...&quot; method.<br />The characters are another bright spot of the book.  Langdon and Sopie stand out to most, but it was Teabing the caught my attention the most.  Brown did a great job capturing the British feel for him and some of his lines still run around in my head, including the draw bridge troll feeling I got when Langdon and Sofie first came to see him at his home.  The only character actions I didn't like was the relationship between Langdon and Sophie at the end.  It seems like most writers fall into that two people involved in a stressful and close situation often fall in love.  Why can't the two just stay friends?<br />Overall The Da Vinci Code was an enjoyable book and I would recommend it to others, but if you want a more satisfying thriller, look to Leonard or Patterson.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I would give this at least 4 stars for content, but had to concur with other viewers that the high list price was ridiculous for the eight episodes. The discounted prices are just about fair for what you get, if not particularly bargain prices. That said, I do agree with the Amazon review (by Mark Englehart), that although this season was short, it was sweet indeed. I was troubled by a certain hardness to the characters in the fourth season, but thought their humanity was back in this season. I'm not too concerned about Carrie's wardrobe--even in her pre-pregnancy days it was outlandish (though entertaining) for those of us who live in the real world. I enjoyed every single episode, from Miranda's fling with Weight Watchers, Charlotte's dabbling in self-help books, Samantha's shopping expedition and babysitting turn (gotta see it), to the final, and best episode of all, the Hamptons wedding farce. My only disappointment was finishing the eighth and final episode and wanting more.
B00005JMTN|5.0|\\"Big Fish\\" is brilliant, it is Tim Burton's best movie of his career. Ewan McGregor plays Young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney (in his Golden-Globe nominated performance) plays his older version of Edward years later. Billy Crudup plays Edward's son, Will. The story is about a father who is dying of cancer and the son who doesn't believe the facts of his life because they seemed too impossible to have really happened. Edward retells his facts of his life to his son and his daughter-in-law, Josephine, played by Marion Cotillard. Through his retellings, he meets a lot of strange, but interesting people. Karl the Giant, played by Matthew McGrory, Jenny, The Witch, played both by Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's real-life girlfriend. There is Norther Winslow, played by Steve Buscemi, Amos Calloway, played by Burton regular, Danny DeVito. Ping and Jing, played by Ada Tai and Arlene Tai. Edward meets the love of her life and his wife, played in his retellings by Alison Lohman and played outside of his retellings by Jessica Lange. There is also the family doctor, Dr. Bennett, played by Robert Guillaume. The movie is brilliant, Tim Burton's best movie ever and his directing is brilliant without compromise. The screenplay by John August, which is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, the screenwriter of Go, Titan A.E., Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. His next screenplay is again with Tim Burton for Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant and the end credits song \\"Man Of The Hour\\" by Pearl Jam is brilliant without compromise. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. The movie also got a Golden Globe Best Picture nomination for a Musical or Comedy. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is brilliant. The production and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Colleen Atwood is brilliant. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian is superb. The visual effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks is brilliant. The performances by Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast are amazing, especially from McGregor, Finney, and Crudup. Casting them was a brilliant plan on Tim Burton's part. I loved this movie, because it was different than what Burton usually does. It is a brilliant achievement for Burton and it is a masterpiece. How it was made was intriguing because it seems that it was strange, but once I got used to the idea of the movie, it made me change my mind right away. It was a little bit like Burton's last masterpiece \\"Ed Wood\\". I enjoyed that movie but I enjoyed this movie better, because it proves that Burton is a gifted filmmaker who knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it. Go see this movie when you can get a chance because it is a brilliant movie that hit the top of my top 10 movies of 2003, and not because that, because of your opinion of the movie, which could change people's minds like it did with me. Take anybody you want to see this magical film that is different than it seems.
B00006DEFA|4.0|This is not a straight biography.  Mozart's vulgarity and financial difficulties are exaggerated.  Haydn never appears.  Salieri was a better composer than \\"Amadeus\\" suggests (he enjoyed a revival during the 1990s).  \\"Don Giovanni\\" ran more than five performances, and was not a flop -- and anyway, five performances were a success in an era when the longest running play of all time was the \\"The Beggar's Opera,\\" with its epic 29 performances.<br />There are other nits to pick, but they miss the point.  Mozart is the title character, but he's not the main character; in fact, he's a Deus Ex Machina for the story of court composer Antonio Salieri's struggle with God.  Having sacrificed everything -- country, leisure time and sex -- for music to glorify his Lord, Salieri is wounded to see a young, unhinged genius surpassing all competitors and barely breaking a sweat doing so.  Like a spurned lover, he questions God's justice, and determines to rob the deity of his voice on Earth.  The film explores the consequences of Salieri's actions -- for himself, for Mozart and for the muse they both served.<br />This is an ambitious idea that could have easily descended into a simple revenge plot, but all involved keep their eyes on the higher drama. F. Murray Abraham, given the role of his life, captures Salieri's agony beautifully.  He's jealous of, and repulsed by, Mozart the man, but is completely in love with the music, and you can see both feelings written on his face as he attends Mozart's operas.  Tom Hulce as Mozart is a good counterpoint: He effectively creates a crude Mozart, an intentionally ahistorical representation.  <br />Forman's directing is excellent, and he deserved his best director Oscar.  It's a shame, though, that the added scenes in this director's cut intensify the focus on Mozart, which seem to reflect his subsequent films' glorification of outsiders than the artistic choices for this particular masterpiece. In \\"Amadeus,\\" where Mozart is a supporting character, his gradual alienation from the world serves the main plot beautifully. It also works in \\"The People Vs. Larry Flynt,\\"  despite Forman's efforts to glorify the title character, because Flynt becomes the catalyst for a thoughtful meditation on free speech.  But when Forman celebrates eccentrics for the sake of being eccentric -- think \\"Man on the Moon\\" -- his films become little more than litanies of deeds, without an explanation of their importance or attempt to connect them to a larger theme.  <br />It's strange to say that the director's cut adds too many scenes with Mozart. But the extra footage gives us too much of the composer's relationship with Vienna, showing his rejection by court society and undermining Salieri's obsession (if Mozart is so unsuccessful, why is Salieri trying to destroy him?). And it distracts us from the fact that \\"Amadeus\\" is not about Amadeus.  It's about his rival.  Mozart's music gives the film beauty; Salieri's agony gives it power.  In the end, Salieri matters more.
B00006RU5B|5.0|i give this album 4 and a half stars, which, i guess rounds up to 5.<BR>i dont especially love RATM or Soundgarden. I agree that they are both groundbreaking bands musically, but as for my own personal tastes, RATM had a little too much hardcore rapping, and in Soundgarden, Chris Cornell was a little more soft (as compared to Audioslave).<BR>But enter Audioslave, which combines the better parts of both RATM and Soundgarden. I love Cornell's lyrics, and the instrumentals that RATM provides complements Cornell's voice perfectly.<br />Cochise (blasting intro), i am the highway (self-liberating anthem), Shadow of the sun (excellent transtion from soft into hard) and getaway car (blues-y  driving music) are the highlights of the CD
B00005JKED|3.0|Antoine Fuqua has made an excellent film for those who are looking for pure action. If your goal is more intelligent fare this may not be for you.<br />The story involves a day in the life of LAPD rookie officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)as he attempts to join an elite narcotics division led by decorated officer Alonzo Harris( Denzel Washington) What Hoyt does not realize is that Harris is not as good a cop as he is made out to be. Denzel Washington (in his Oscar winning role) plays the bad cop with gusto. While it may not be his best performance it certainly is not his worst. Washington comes across as a kind of police version of Tony Montana and the end of the film becomes sort of cartoonish.<br />Hawke does a good job playing the rookie who makes bad choices throughout the film Fuqua says that these choices are all related to ambition and I will buy into that theory to some extent.<br />This is essentially a two character film and both leads acquit themselves quite well. Support is offered by Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Dr. Dre as a member of Alonzo's unit and Snoop Dogg as another dealer on the streets. Los Angeles is portrayed to great effect and the texture is suitably gritty. Fuqua shot the film in parts of the city that most tourists don't see and the viewer feels the pulse of the streets.<br />I will admit that I liked the film more after a second viewing with Fuqua's audio commentary. The disc provides a featurette and trailer plus two music videos.

B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets, since it's release in 1986, has been the benchmark for every other heavy metal album since. It was a sound that, before this time, was nothing like anyone had ever really experienced fully. The release of Master of Puppets proved that metal wasn't a fad; it is one of the highlights of the next decade, and will continue to shine throughout the years of musical inspiration. Many fans consider this to be the best work of Metallica, and everything that proceeded after it fundamentally flawed because of the greatness of this album. How do you compete with the best cut of music the genre has ever seen? Of course, there is still some heated debate about which album can make the cut for &quot;Best Metallica Album Ever,&quot; but Master of Puppets is the most obvious candidate around.

B00003CX9E|5.0|This DVD is brilliant and essential in any serious collection. It is a pleasure to watch this classic with stunningly crisp picture and sound.<br />This 2 DVD set contains the #1 rated American movie of all time in resored digital transfer with multiple commentary tracks; more importantly, it also contains a narrative documentary that traces the fast-paced life of the young Orson Welles whose career would be dashed over this film.<br />The documentary's thesis - that Kane is essentially an autobiography of Welles superimposed on the canvas of publisher W.R. Hearst's life is a cogent argument and one of the most facinating stories in 20th century America.<br />Both men were willing to sacrifice the truth for spectacle, and both succeeded in radically transforming the world around them. Hearst changed newspapering in America. In the early days he'd pay any price to get the best reporters and editors and turn them against the rich and powerful. Welles equally changed the world of electronic media, showing the world the terror that radio could bring with 'The War of the Worlds' and the political muscle Hollywood could weild with 'Kane.'<br />It might seem that Welles got the last laugh in this showdown.But the documentary is wise to point out that the movie's legacy is the only enduring winner. Movie lovers around the world also win - as 'Kane' is one of the most entertaining and dramatic yarns in cinema history.<br />The audio commentary tracks by Roger Ebert and Welles biographer Peter Bogdanovich are chock full of cinematic insights and interesting anecdotes.<br />And, last but not least, these DVDs are very cheaply priced for a package comparable to a deluxe Criterion Collection edition. A+

B00004ZAV3|5.0|27 songs, in pristine sound, on one disc is undoubtedly a bargain.  If you were calling it their &quot;Greatest Hits,&quot; however, people would fight for eternity about what to inlcude on it.  Each Beatles fan should take their collection and burn their essential songs onto their personal CD so everyone is happy. I've actually made two CD's with 56 songs on them and I'm in hog heaven.  Many of the songs on those discs came from this disc, since &quot;Come Together&quot; and many others sound so good.  If this collection turned on one young person to the brilliance of the Beatles, then its job has been done!!

B00005NWM3|4.0|Nickelback has come out with another great CD.  This 10-track album has many great songs on it.  Starting off the CD with 'Never Again', the group addresses the atrocity of domestic violence.  My favorite song, 'How You Remind Me' is the second track; This hit, very grudge-like, is an eye-opener to people caught in a bad relationship.  'Silver Side Up', while not one of Nickelback's best albums, it's still a great CD, and is buy-worthy.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle is its own band, not just some short-lived side project.  APC's contract with Virgin (their record label) calls for them to release at least 3 CD's, so complaints that singer Maynard James Keenan should focus on Tool are futile, since APC is obligated to produce at least 1 more record.  Personally, I'm ecstatic that there's another APC album in the works.  Thirteenth Step is the best album I've heard in a long time.  Mer De Noms was a great album, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer Thirteenth Step based on overall quality rather than the standout tracks on Sea of Names.  Favorite tracks off Thirteenth Step include the Package, Weak and Powerless, and the strangely appealing The Nurse Who Loved Me, which apparently is a cover of a song by a band called [The?] Failure.  But like any great album, Thirteenth Step must be listened to in its entirety to be fully appreciated.  The only reasonable excuse for not buying this album would be dissatisfaction with the fact that Maynard might use his share of the proceeds to buy more $64,000 bottles of wine.  I personally prefer that extravagance to other options, like the singer obtaining heroin with the proceeds instead, which seemed to be the problem with a few of my other favorite bands.  <BR>2 more things to note...<BR>1.  I've heard that this CD is protected from burning, which might turn a few people off<BR>2.  and if you still insist on clamoring for Maynard to make another Tool album, let's not forget the other members of Tool...even though Danny Carey's drumming is essential to Tool, I haven't heard a huge outcry about his involvement with Pygmy Love Circus.  Probably because a) people aren't aware or b) the people who are aware of Carey's other band know that they suck.  Still, though, let's be fair to Tool and APC and respect both bands for their unique identities.
B00005JH9W|5.0|At last: an affordable way to own the DVD of this incredible film.  It still manages to shock and disturb nearly a century after its release and has timeless lessons about human compassion, or the lack thereof.  For anyone who has ever experienced rejection...for anyone who has ever rejectED, this brilliant \\"little\\" movie will haunt you always.<br /><br />The filmmakers had no idea how timeless or important their \\"chiller\\" would become.  The accompanying documentary is extremely interesting and informative, as is the commentary track.
B000002OX7|5.0|When I first heard Who's Next I was honestly blown away.  It is truly one of Rock and Roll's greatest albums.  No song on the album is slouching.  From Baba Oreily to Pure and Easy, the album will leave you speechless.  Won't Get Fooled Again, Baba O'Reily, Bargain, and Behind Blue Eyes are the definite classics, but it is hard to forget Getting in Tune, My Wife, and Going Mobile.  Pure and Easy is also pretty awesome.  Tommy is a great album, but in my opinion Who's Next is a shing moment in rock history.  Any other album is simply &quot;Teenage Wasteland.&quot;
B000059Z8J|5.0|Seeing this sparkling, colorful movie again on DVD is enhanced with all the extra special behind-the-scenes features and is a real smorgasbord for audiences of all ages.

There is just something about it that never gets old.

This is John Williams at his best.  If you like his work, check out his excellent and under promoted work in 1972's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, too...available on CD with music from THE PAPER CHASE.
0452282152|5.0|This is a stunningly beautiful book, one of the best I have read in a long while.  Chevalier has created a heroine who is at once a hopeless underdog and a certain champion.  Griet is both an engaging narrator and a loveable character.  Vermeer's character is drawn less descriptively but nonetheless equally fascinating.  He is shown as a masterful artist and also as a human being.<br />The novel builds with a steady, powerful tension despite the fact that we all can guess what is going to happen.  I loved the descriptions of Vermeer's painting process.  The scenes in which he is studying and drawing Griet are sensual and smartly written.  I found myself flipping back to the front cover of the book to study the painting as I read about its creation.  Everything is there, exactly as Chevalier describes it in her story.  The folds and shadows of the cloth in her hair, the wetness of her lips, the expression on her face as she turns to look over her shoulder, the faint glow in her eye as it catches the light of the earring, and of course the pearl earring itself.  With each element that is added in the story, the painting on the cover becomes more and more real.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in return.<br />The movie 'Moulin Rouge' is a tour de force of modern and romantic/historical synthesis.  The events take place at the turn of the century, a mythical tale of a staid and conservative English boy from London travelling to wild and exotic Paris, in the Montmarte district, to be an artist, and to fall in love.  Aptly named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor, and of course, he will fall from grace and stray from the path), the hero of course becomes involved with the artistic crowd, including Toulouse-Lautrec (played brilliantly by artificially diminutive John Leguizamo).<br />From the beginning, with music from 'The Sound of Music', later joined by the most inventive renderings of hits from Madonna and Elton John (among many, many others), one gets the feeling that real fun was had in the creation of this piece; who would think 'The Hills are Alive' could serve as a quintessential bohemian revolutionary piece?<br />Our hero constantly waxes plagiaristically-poetic on the brilliance of love, and of course, soon finds love, in a tragic and unavailable beauty, the star of the Moulin Rouge (played by Nicole Kidman).  Satine is instead being set up to 'entertain' a Duke, a wealthy financier the nightclub owner Zidler hopes will save his flagging fortunes.  Naturally a mix-up occurs, the young poet being mistaken for the wealthy Duke, and fate is sealed as they fall in love.<br />Satine does a number worthy of Madonna and Marilyn Monroe with a very material-girl 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend'; eventually all falls apart as the identities are resolved, the Duke invests, the hero pens a 'legitimate' musical, but ultimately, all goes tragically awry when love gives way to practical reality and true human conditions.<br />The costumes and settings are over the top in every way - the gray existence is far more gray, the colours far more colourful, and all the music has snap and pop befitting the best of pop music and burlesque.  The choreography is simply amazing, complementing the storyline seamlessly.  The direction is quick and energetic, and editing quite amazing, and the composition/remixing of music together makes this Oscar-winner a real pleasure.<br />The DVD has various extras, behind the scenes interviews with all the major production personnel, from the director and costumer and choreographer to the writers and actors.  There is even a 'Making of...' special produced by HBO that gives much background material.<br />This is a toe-tapping, sing-along, fast-paced film, a real Spectacular, Spectacular!  if ever there were one.  And through it all, there is one strand, one key, one thing to learn.<br />The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in return.g the best of pop music and burlesque.

B000024D4R|3.0|Where The Wall had weak music and a strong concept, Animals is the reverse: music that is for the most part utterly spellbinding, but a concept that really should not have been bound together so tightly, or perhaps even foregone completely.  This is where Roger Waters, to my ear, first made a seriously aggressive attempt to force music (and certain band members) to the back burner, and it seems to, lyrically and conceptually, have done more damage than good.  As I noted in my review of Pink Floyd's next work, The Wall, the internal friction within the band ultimately cost them dearly.  Their previous work, Wish You Were Here, would be their last truly balanced album until The Division Bell.<br />I should mention, though, that this IS a very nicely done album from a *musical* standpoint, despite the places where Mr. Waters seems to begin the trend (brought to fruition on The Wall) of stripping out the mystery and the ambience of the music, no longer allowing it (or its writers) to speak for itself.  Easily, &quot;Dogs&quot; is the most spectacular of the songs on this albums.  In fact, I credit Mr. Gilmour's fascinating acoustic guitar playing here for inspiring me to take up the instrument--that is just how good he is here.  The chord sequence is mesmerising...and that's putting it mildly.  Also, despite the fact that Mr. Wright isn't even granted a *single* credit on this album (even Mr. Gilmour only gets one!), he does utterly jaw-dropping things with a synthesiser in the interlude of this song, which may in fact be the best segment on the entire album to listen to.  THIS is what makes Animals worth purchasing--no doubt in my mind.<br />&quot;Pigs&quot; is an interesting, though somewhat less innovative number that (IF you totally believe the credits, which I don't) was written by Roger Waters.  Perhaps its most notable features are Mr. Gilmour's talk-box solo.  There's also the uncharacteristically blunt, angry piano work from Mr. Wright, which makes one imagine him fuming silently in the background over the course the band was trying to take without him.  &quot;Sheep&quot; is notable for the Rhodes intro by Mr. Wright, for which, along with other synth and effect contributions on this song, I think he really ought to be credited.  Also an interesting sonic trick is the blending of Mr. Waters' voice into the synth.  But ultimately, the pre-Animals concert version, &quot;Raving and Drooling&quot;, was far superior...which gets to the root of the problem with Animals in the lyrical and conceptual department.<br />Animals, I believe, is the concept that never should have been.  Following the success of The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, Mr. Waters seems to have felt compelled to follow immediately with a third album in the same vein.  Not yet having envisioned The Wall, he seems to have had a lot of very adolescent angst with nowhere to go.  Since an album consisting simply of pure ranting and venting would not do, he tried to cobble together a concept by assigning the categories of people he didn't like the names of animals, a move that would appear to parallel Orwell's Animal Farm.  Unfortunately, this only succeeded in showing just how contrived the &quot;concept&quot; really was--it may in fact have been better for him to just leave the animal references out, and wait a bit longer for a moer innovative concept to come along...or best of all, just relax and jam.  The lyrics become laughable, in their display of blind, immature, and pointless anger...and yes, I admit I am biased because of what that anger did both on and off the stage.<br />Probably the worst thing that could've happened to Animals was &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot;.  These annoyingly simplistic guitar songs attempt to tie the album together, giving it the same cyclic nature as the previous two concept albums.  But instead, they come off as nothing but bookends...and not even impressive ones, at that.  The second one, especially, is a problem because it turns around and completely flies in the face of the entire atmosphere Mr. Waters has been building over the course of the album.  It's a *love* song, of all things, which is very clearly just tacked onto the end of the album.<br />In my opinion, Animals did have potential, especially with the great music in the middle three songs, but in his obsessive haste, Roger Waters instead started the process of driving Pink Floyd into the ground, that culminated in the breakup after The Wall.  This is an interesting album in many regards--but make sure to pick up Meddle, The Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish You Were Here first, to understand what the four-member Pink Floyd was at its finest.cause it turns around and completely flies in the face of the entire atmosphere Mr. Waters has been building over the course of the album.

B00002Z88D|5.0|Written in memory of Maestro Michael Kamen, (15 April 1948 - 18 November 2003), by a fan of his.<br />There is no doubt in my mind what an amazing and passionate spirit Michael Kamen is...this only made it even more evident.  The arrangements, of course, were spectacular, and I cannot think of a single song that did not benefit tremendously from Michael and his orchestra. One could hardly imagine two more different genres of music--and yet the result was such that every note, every majestic chord was exactly where it should be...as if it had been destined from the very beginning, just as Michael said in the liner notes.<br />I began my musical life through classical music and only later moved into rock when I heard Pink Floyd, with whom Michael collaborated--and for me, having enjoyed both genres, this is the perfect synthesis.  Michael describes it as &quot;conducting a conversation between two different worlds that share the language of music.  Creating a dialogue between two worlds that celebrate the power of music.  I live in both worlds...now, so does Metallica.&quot;<br />I will probably not ever investigate Metallica's other works...for I feel like all that I need to know is right here.  This also allows me, I think, to hear this work without the biases that would come with being a harcore fan.  I don't put down any songs because of what album they happen to come from.  I can find beauty in both &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot; and &quot;Hero of the Day&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and &quot;Bleeding Me&quot;.  I don't know--maybe it's true that without Michael Kamen's &quot;magical&quot; touch, these songs would be nothing, but what I hear on S &amp; M is utterly gorgeous.  To hear these songs with the power of the orchestra is what truly allows me to enjoy this.<br />Michael himself said it best: &quot;Imagine taking a very stark black and white picture, tough and relentless, unpredictable yet hypnotic--as black and white as a piece of music on paper...as driving and powerfully honest as pumping guitars, bass, drums and voice can be...and adding orchestral light and shade, burts of color, and surprising blocks of sound from all the incredible expressive musical instruments that have been created over hundreds of years to speak and sing our passion, our lives.&quot;  And they succeeded at this.  Somehow, even the song with the grimmest lyrics became part of this great celebration. And that's how I think he was...smiling even through the most difficult things including his diagnosis with multiple sclerosis in 1996.  In a different way, I truly believe Michael Kamen is smiling even now.  &quot;I live in both worlds now...&quot;<br />There is one fact that cannot be denied...Michael Kamen will ALWAYS be remembered.  And in this great concert, I feel that I have experienced a celebration of life, a legacy of power.

B00006IUNN|2.0|We do need an updated Pacific-war film as a companion to 'Private Ryan', perhaps, 'Beach Red', 'None but the Brave', 'Sands of Iwo Jima' or even Jeffrey Hunter's entertaining 60s duo 'Hell to Eternity' and 'No Mans an Island' updated to current production values: Well, a movie about a very obscure and specialised aspect of the Pacific War was probably never likely to be it, it subsequently failed to teach us much about the role of Navajo code-talkers in the war, and failed to be much of a regular war-film to be taken seriously either.<BR>Opening close quarters Marines vs Japanese battle-scene on Guadalcanal was actually promising and rather graphically impressive, this seems to be a pattern with mediocre war-efforts lately, an impressive staged opening battle-scene, then its all downhill from there. 'Harts War' did the same thing.<BR>After that, cliches abound, accuracy to any typical Pacific-Island tactical war situation that Im familiar with eludes  me, and consists of Japanese soldiers repeatedly springing -out individually or in small group, charging yelling down little hills and being over and over again put away with Chicago choppers.  (Like a Japanese imitation of the old 'Combat'TV-show Germans) Caje doesnt really work even in casting, doesnt really know how to go about portraying the cliched stressed-out traumatised veteran, to be fair he probably gets about as far as expected with a 50s pedestrian script and a director who by the sound of his name cut his teeth on Hong-Kong chop-sockey movies, and if it had Kung-Fu instead of rifles artillery and bayonette charges, this would actually be an above-average contribution to that genre. He must have been instinctively- tempted to make greater use of the sword-wielding Japanese-officers.The two Native-Americans and their knife-fights hand-to-hand with the Japanese troops are actually well-done and a highlight in a low dark landscape, , theres that martial-arts film experience shining again.( Was this revenge forthe Japanese Samurai that messed up all those native-American warriors  in the cornfield in that cool Charles Bronson-Toshiro Mifune western  years ago?)<br />Sets and costumes are ok, credit where its due, the Japanese strong-points with a camouflaged period field-gun look about right.<br />Like 'U-571' and  'Harts War', ok for keeping the kids out of your hair for a couple of hours. Other than that, Native-americans would be the only other target-audience.Even so, Im not aware that Native-American Code-talkers  actually made possible the Allied victory over Japan, I'd need more convincing than this sensationalising, misleading melodrama.
038572179X|5.0|ATONEMENT by Ian McEwan<br />Shortlisted for the prestigious MAN BOOKER award, ATONEMENT by Ian McEwan is a complex story dealing with two things: a teenage girl who falsely accuses a young man of a crime he did not commit, and the impact this actions makes on those that are left to suffer for it.<BR> <BR>It is a few years before England's involvement in World War II. Briony Tallis is the youngest of the Tallis family, where at the start of the novel she is a mere thirteen years old. She's fond of writing; no, she's obsessed by it, and one of her favorite \\"things to do\\" is to write plays in which the family will enact when it is complete.  Briony is in the process of trying to get her family members, including visiting cousins fifteen-year-old Lola and the nine-year-old twins Jackson and Pierrot, to act out their individual parts, but Lola and the twins are not cooperating. Briony runs off in a huff, and soon finds herself out in the gardens, where she spies Robbie and her sister Cecelia.<br />Robbie is the son of one of the family's most dedicated servants.  He has no father, and so has been put under the wing of the Tallises. His education is paid for, and he is now going to University. There is some resentment towards him, as the reader will soon discover.  While Briony is sulking out in the garden, there is a scene with Cecelia and Robbie which Briony misinterprets, and from there she begins (in her immature and fanciful way) to imagine all sorts of horrors that Robbie may be inflicting upon older sister Cecelia.<br />With Briony it is one misinterpretation after another, all involving Robbie and her sister. It is obvious Briony is a very naive girl for the age of thirteen.  None of this would have been important, however, except that things start to snowball and Briony starts to mull these events over in her mind. She develops a one-sided opinion of Robbie, by assuming too many things and never finding out the real truth.  Then, one evening Lola is discovered by Briony, looking as if she has been beaten up and left to die. We are seeing this through the eyes of Briony, and the reader is left to guess what really happened to Lola.  However, Briony takes it upon herself to give a full report of this crime, regardless of the fact that she could barely see what was happening that night, stating that it was Robbie who had been the culprit and that he must be punished for hurting her cousin Lola.  Unfortunately, the adults believe Briony, not Robbie, and he is taken off to prison.<br />And thus, the story is set up for the reader.  The story moves forward, with the War in full force, Robbie is out of prison and sent overseas to fight for England. Cecelia is a nurse, waiting for Robbie to return, for they have pledged their love to each other.  Neither have any contact with the Tallis', but neither does Briony, who decides to become a nurse as well.  <br />ATONEMENT may seem to be a complex and difficult book to read.  Yes, there is not much dialogue and much more exposition.  However, if the reader is lucky enough to finish this book, one will have to agree that it was most highly deserved to be nominated for the Booker Prize in 2001.  This reviewer was totally surprised with the ending, and I believe I am not the only one. ATONEMENT was one of my favorite reads of 2003.  Highly recommended!

Something like Alan Moore's and David Lloyd's <BR>V for Vendetta.<br />This extraordinary epic tells us the tale of a masked avenger, a frightened little girl, a fascist state where control of citizens is total and the people in charge unforgiving.<br />I am not going to tell you the story of the book, not even a little bit of it, because doing that would take away some of the fun in reading it. <br />All I am going to tell you is that this book isn't like usual comic books. This book doesn't try to add as much fighting to the story as possible just for the sake of it. This book is great because it has an interesting story and great art work. The art is the kind of art that is realistic but still special. This is a book that everyone should read. <BR>(By the way, if you own a copy of Tori Amos' CD \\"Strange little girls\\" I really recommend listenong to the last song, \\"Real men\\", when you read V for Vendetta. Believe me, it's really fitting.)
B0000C6E4D|3.0|This CD is good.  Her sound is unique and has been missed for the past 5 years since her last album.  &quot;Afterglow&quot; is not her best work though.  It's very mellow,sometimes too mellow.  Lyrics are so-so.  I would say borrow this CD but don't feel like you have to own it.
B000005HLV|1.0|I was expecting someting along the lines of Bad Brains or Living Colour, but instead I got a bunch of white boy clowns singing about the Devil.  I may have to get some of my homeys down here so we can kick their lily butts.
0452282152|4.0|A simple story that brought you back to experience what life must have been first hand for those less well off. Also, made me think about how, for some including Vermeer, art was a way for them to make a living - not just a past time or secondary pursuit. Well written. Can see how hollywood grabbed it up.
B000002UDD|5.0|I agree to some people saying that Megadeth's &quot;Peace Sells...&quot; and &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; a superior to this album. But anyway, this is one of those classic thrash-metal CDs fully deserving a 5-star rating.<br />Despite his known drug-abuse problems and line-up changes, Dave Mustaine managed to put out yet another piece of high-speed, emotional, angry and hateful music, with venomous vocal rasps and lightning-fast solos. <BR>I have to admit that this album got me acquainted with Megadeth back in 89, and it took a good amount of time to hook me up. But in the end it proved to be an excellent addition to Megadeth's series of thrash-metal greatness, continuing up until &quot;Youthanasia&quot; was released in 1994. Some call early Megadeth's style &quot;thrash'n'roll&quot;, and they are not very far from the truth.<BR>This record shouldn't be your first buy in Megadeth's discography, but it firmly belongs in the Top-5 of Mustaine's albums and I recommend you to buy it eventually.<br />PS I don't know if anyone mentioned it here, but the track &quot;Liar&quot; is dedicated to Megadeth's ex-guitarist Chris Poland. Nice one, eh? :)
078681859X|5.0|I bought this book, somewhat reluctantly, for my 8-year-old daughter who is waiting not so patiently for the next Harry Potter volume.  At the time I ordered it I regarded it, with some condescension, as yet another Harry Potter clone.  After it arrived I picked it up to skim the first few pages.  Then a few more.  Then, in a shameful abuse of parental power, I confiscated it from my daughter so I could read it first.<br />This is an excellent, absolutely entertaining book, fully worth the money for Bartimaeus's hilarious footnotes alone.  I don't usually like books that switch points of view between characters, but in this case, the switching works and conveys the complexity of plot and character more effectively than if the author had stuck to one character consistently.  As others have noted, this book is darker in tone than Harry Potter, and my sense is that it is a better book for adults and teenagers than it is for children. There are no good guys in this book, for example (at least in terms of major characters), only Really Bad Guys and our heroes, who are not without their own flaws.<br />But what wonderful flaws! I don't think I've encountered such an enjoyable character as Bartimaeus in a book in a very, very long time.  It makes me wish the book were real and I could sit down and toss back a few beers with Bartimaeus, listening to his sharp but right-on-target assessment of human beings.<br />Bottom line:  If you are disinclined to buy this book because you are convinced it is just another unoriginal Harry Potter rip-off, please reconsider.  It would not surprise me in the slightest if in the future the Bartimaeus Trilogy is remembered and revered far longer than the Harry Potter books.<br />p.s. And somebody needs to tell Stroud to knock off this \\"trilogy\\" business.  Surely there will be more than three Bartimaeus books, won't there? Please??
0452282152|5.0|I didn't realize how much I had enjoyed reading *Girl with a Pearl Earring* until I had finished the last page, closed the book, and saw that there wasn't any more of it to read. It seduced my attention in such small steps that I hadn't noticed what Tracy Chevalier had accomplished: this is not just an interesting story about a painting, it is a stunning portrait in itself. To borrow a phrase from a high school teacher of mine, Tracy Chevalier could write about opening a box of cereal, and it would still be the most interesting thing you have read in a month. <br />I read in a review on this website that *Pearl Earring* was a \\"surprisingly good read\\" despite its lack of plot and abundance of \\"uninteresting\\" and \\"unpleasant\\" characters. This description also suggests what the reviewer thinks would comprise an UNsurprisingly good book - lots of plot and pleasant characters? What fun would that be?  <br />The reason this reviewer thought the book was good _anyway_ is because Chevalier managed to break through his or her preconception that \\"good\\" means \\"a lot of cool stuff is going on.\\" <br />In Griet, Griet's family, and Griet's employers, Chevalier has created a wonderfully detailed and intelligent possible world where works of art may be created.  After reading this book (in two days flat, by the way - I did not want to stop reading), I wanted to thank Chevalier for changing the way I could admire a painting. Vermeer was in the book, yes. All the little facts were correct, and historic Delft was presented plague, market, art patrons and all. <br />But in the end, I only really cared about the girl - the girl who could read the people around her with only a glance, who knew that respectable women did not appear  open-mouthed in portraits, who could see without being told what is missing in a small, dark spot of canvas, and who could find comfort in a small square of Delft tile made by her poor father when forced to live apart from him.<br />If you are interested in this sort of an exercise in historical fiction, I highly recommend this book.  And if you're wondering how a slow, quiet story without a plot can be enjoyable, read it and let Chevalier surprise you.
B0000029DD|5.0|It's a magic carpet ride to the heavens and back.  Put on the headphones and step onto the intricate fabric of &quot;Grace&quot;.   You will soar on Buckley's voice and crave the trip again and again.  Try not to wear it out:  this album stands alone.   There were not enough flaws on &quot;Grace&quot; to keep the artist from being summoned by the gods.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|After recieving this DVD set for Christmas and viewing some of the material I have came to an conclusion. Remeber the following statements are MY OPINION and may not necessarily reflect yours.<br />THE CONTENT: The amount on the disks is stupendous. I could not believe the amount of extras crammed on these disks and some being actually interesting. Unfortuantely they did not have comments from either James Cameron or David Fincher which was a bit of a disappointment. But the sheer quantity of other material helped me over come this problem (4 / 5)<br />THE RESTORATION: I was imperresed with how they restored ALIEN, ALIEN 3, and ALIEN RESURRECTION.I on the other hand was not imperresed how they restored ALIENS. The widescreen format was gone and the picture was less sharp. I am at a loss even though with the two versions (theatrical and special) it did not exceed 5 hours. Can't a DVD hold 7 at high resolution? Maybe there was other stuff. Oh well. (3 / 5).<br />THE CD LAYOUT: I was imperresed with the layout of the multiple DVDS. It quickly allowed access to the 50+ hours of extras. They kept the movies (and their additional version) on one disk and the feautrattes on the other disk plus a seperate disk with additional features (9 disks all together) (4.5 / 5)<br />THE MOVIES: I enjoyed the first 3 a lot (I do not understand the issues people had with the 3rd in the series). I on the other hand was not imperresed with the fourth (full up to the brim with plot holes) (3.75 / 4)<br />THE PACKAGE: The box that it came in unfolded for about five feet making it very hard to work with. The box begin to break as soon as I opened it and one compartment came un glued partially. I had to re-glue it with crazy glue. I do not see how this box set will survive for 1 + year no matter how gently you treat it (1. 5 / 5)<br />The total is 3.35 and I will round to a 3.5 (C -) for good content, good layout (DVD), fairly good movies, but terrible packaging.
B000068QY7|3.0|Okay. Here it is (you can ignore all the other reviews). Hindu Times is a good Oasis album. It is not great, especially when compared to earlier albums - reviewers might be inclined to give the album five stars because they are reeling from the awful Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. For any other group, an album like Hindu Times would get four stars, but since Oasis is capable of so much more ... only three.<br />There are some very good songs on Hindu Times, but the album does not compare to the group's first three albums (I liked Be Here Now, am I the only one?).<br />I like to think of Hindu Times as a big step in the right direction, but just a step.<br />Let's hope Oasis' next offering continues the trend.<br />For the real Oasis fan, this album will be a treat (maybe helping to erase the bad taste SOTSOG left). If you are not a true fan, well, you probably didn't know Hindu Times existed anyway.
B000062YB1|5.0|Yes, this is their last one with Dave Lombardo behind the drum kit. And history has proved that the creative chemistry won't work magic with his replacement, Paul Bostaph.<BR>This album is like a mixture of its 2 highly successive predecessors, taking speed, brutality and satanic lyrics from &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, and mid- and slow-tempo, heavy melodism and more reality-oriented lyrics from &quot;South of Heaven&quot;. As before, all the band members show exceptional skill with their instruments (except for bassing by Araya, but that's another story :)  ), and Dave Lombardo further proves that he is a drumming god.<br />A diverse and aggressive album, deserving a place in any metalhead's collection.
B00006V9A0|3.0|I am actually a big fan of the greatest hits package. Many artist will never make a great album. Just ask Iggy after he left Stooges(with the exception of &quot;The Idiot&quot;), and his greatest hits record is all right. But Nirvana? In the small time that they were recording tunes, they put out great records. Therefore, this record is here to supply Courtney Love.<BR>The song choices are fairly obvious, mainly consisting of the radio hits that have been mainstays on the radio for a good decade, and one new song, &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;. Why not just put that new song out on a single so I don't have to buy this? I refuse to pay fifteen dollars for one new song, you hear me Courtney?<BR>So, please, just go and buy the Nirvana records. Each one of them---with the exception of &quot;Incesctiside&quot; ehich is decent but like all B-Sides comps, hit or miss---are flawless records that cement the time and place where they were recorded.
0767903862|5.0|This book is *not* a thorough examination of Australian history, geography, sports, contributions to science, Aboriginal relations, social peculiarities, or tourist destinations. It is, however, loaded with fascinating facts and anecdotes about all of these things, and is utterly engaging and well written. It's hilarious, too, and all in all, the best book I've read in months.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is a rare thing to find a television show that sports a great cast AND a great storyline. This unique show has both.My wife and I purchased this over the holidays. We made it a marathon weekend and watched all the episodes. After watching the entire first season, I found that I had missed out on something pretty incredible. When it originally aired, it was shown out of order and several episodes weren't shown at all making things very confusing. It is shame how a great show can be mishandled the way this one was. There is a mix of the old fashioned Western and classic Science fiction. I found that Joss Whedon made the mix not only believable but loveable at the same time. Each episode made me yearn for another(thus the marathon viewing). If you love campy humor (of the likes of the old Buck Rogers Tv Shows), deep background stories and hints of more..this series will be for you. My wife and I give this series 4 thumbs up!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|If you're reading this, you probably have already seen &quot;Pink Floyd at Pompeii&quot; at one time or other. The good thing about this DVD is that it includes the orginal cut. The image and sound are perfect. The main feature, though is not, in my view, as interesting and innovative as the original release once was. The diurector has chosen to add some scenes to the original cut, as well as some film from when he visited the band recording Dark Side Of The Moon. Ironically, an excelent DVD about the recording of The Dark Side Of The Moon has come out separately, but that is another story. In my opinion, this is better left untouched. It's still worth it, but always watching the original cut. The quality of the images in the Director's Cut looks inferior to me as well. Anyway: If you like &quot;The Floyd&quot; i guess my recommendation is buy this one, and watch the original (you' ll probably watch both and agree) and buy the Making of Dark Side Of The Moon DVD separately, which brings OWESOME footage and brand new parformances by Waters and Gilmour not included on this DVD.
B000062YAZ|5.0|With over 3 hundred reviews, I'm sure everything has already been said. But I feel the need to give praise to one of the most deserving albums in metal history.<br />Slayer went over the top in every possible way and produced the most uncompromising, aggressive, evil, brutal record on Earth. Since then, many bands tried to claim the brutality throne, but this is not possible, since the first one to get there will forever be the first. And the first were Slayer.<br />Revved up to 200+ beats per minute, filled with aggressive screams of Tom Araya, fueled by highly technical, purposely dissonant guitar solos of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, with genious drumming of Dave Lombardo to base on, this record rushes through your head like a series of machine-gun shots, and ends after 27 minutes, leaving you breathless, trying to grasp the experience you've just had.<br />I can't recommend this CD enough. Get it now!
B000002JR8|5.0|Pantera is one of the best bands out there.  They opened up a whole new genre of music and redefined the words &quot;heavy metal&quot;.  They are purely amazing.  &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; is a perfect example of Pantera's musical style.  It's heavy and melodic.  It has some of the greatest guitar parts ever written.  Overall, this CD is amazing and i would recommend it for any metal fan.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the zone has a musical variety much much more than all three of her previous albums combined. All the songs have depth and variety and a great deal of quality in them. I specially liked Me Against the Music and its Remix, Toxic, Outrageous and Brave New Girl.
B000084T18|4.0|This album is worth the $10.99 Amazon is charging for it.  50 Cent didn't just make 1 bangin track &quot;IN DA CLUB&quot; &amp; the rest of the album junk.  Most, if not all of the tracks on the cd are decent.  I hate buying cd's with 1 stand-out track &amp; the rest is booty.  I'm not that interested in G-Unit crew however.  When is 50's next album????
B0000028M7|5.0|Some say this is grunge, but I would consider this dark-metal.  Alice in Chains is one of the most influencial bands to many of the bands that are playing music today (such as Godsmack).  Dirt proves that Alice in Chains can keep things rockin' loud with classics like &quot;Them Bones,&quot; &quot;Rooster,&quot; and &quot;Would?&quot;  This is a must-buy for any fan of rock music out there.  I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed.
B000002IMG|4.0|Sadly, after promising debut, Testament moved down the treaded path, trying to get close to Metallica's success.<br />Though I generally like this album (so I rate it a 4), I agree than it hasn't aged well and now clearly represents that alongside the titans of thrash there were plenty of bands, good but never deserving a place on top. And for a reason. The reason here being lack of truly original ideas to write some brilliant songs.<br />You should buy the 1st Testament album, &quot;The Legacy&quot;. All the others are weaker and are of interest to serious fans of the genre only.
0446677450|1.0|Not worth the time really.  I was given the book or would not have otherwise read it.  I found many words with very little actually being said. <BR>Wealthy Barber at least gets you pointed safely in the right direction without filling your head with dreams of wealth and power untold.
B00003Q43A|1.0|I shelled out $1.50 of my hard-earned money to see this goofy movie at the budget theatre, even though I had a pretty good idea that this was stupid beyond belief.  Why would I do such a thing?  Simply put, seeing the White House getting blown up was sort of fun, and $1.50 isn't that punitive of a price to pay for the guilty pleasure of a few special effects.<br />However, I didn't anticipate the movie being as stupid &amp; corny as it turned out to be.  I don't know what was harder to take --- the jingoistic &quot;only good old American know-how can save us now&quot; mentality (I guess no other country has the capacity for organizing a simple air attack), or the notion that you can take down an entire invasion fleet with a virus implanted by a pipsqueak laptop computer (which would probably STILL be trying to plant that virus, even today!).<br />It wasn't particularly an issue that there were holes in the plot.  Most viewers have come to expect that.  However, these holes were unashamedly gaping holes, accompanied by ridiculous dialogue and disengaged acting that just makes the viewer cringe, or at least it should.  Anyone with a brain should have been groaning through most of this film, and the folks that paid full price for this are deserving of our pity.<br />So what were we left with, after all the plot holes &amp; bad acting?  A bunch of really nifty explosions, which is great if you were fortunate to see them on the big screen.  However, if you are hoping for a similar impact from the special effects, you will be in for a disappointment.  This really is a film best experienced in a movie theatre.  On a television, even with the biggest of screens, the viewer is left with the impression of cardboard models being blown up with firecrackers, thus making the movie uniformly stupid.  Of course, since the special effects were the only redeeming feature about this movie, there truly is no point in watching it at all now.  Save your time &amp; your money.
B0000A1RJI|1.0|This CD is defective. When playing it on a PC, you get lots of clipping and artifact in the tracks. These clips ruin what is otherwise a great soundtrack. Do not buy this until Disney recalls it and releases one which is competently mastered. ...I have not tried it on a regular CD player yet, but as far as I'm concerned, any CD which does not play correctly in a PC is a defective CD. <br />Again, do not buy this item until Disney competently masters it.
B00005JKG9|5.0|An excellently acted film with a great script.  Each actor rubs on you the wrong way, which just draws you in more to see it unfold.  Kevin Spacey and Jack Lemmon are rarely better than this.  No bells and whistles, just a remarkable ensemble playing out a terrifically written piece.
B000002IKR|5.0|This is their 1st album, and they couldn't make anything sounding as fresh and inspired as this one in years.<br />Yes, it's a bit naive and old-fashioned if look back to it, released over 15 years ago. But still it's a prime example of bay-area thrash-metal. Raw, powerful, fast, with good vocals, proficient guitars and effective rhythm-section. Songwriting is consistently strong, too. If only Testament stayed on their own path and never tried to copy Metallica, they could have become one of thrash-superstars, on par with Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax. But sadly, they chose to imitate another successful act, thus becoming one of good but not great members of the 2nd echelon of thrash-metal bands.<br />If you want to get the best of thrashing Testament, get this record.
B000002UAO|2.0|Playlist: Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, skip3 (You Won't See Me), Nowhere Man, skip5 (Think for Yourself), skip6 (The Word), skip7 (Michelle - awful!), skip8 (What Goes On - really awful!), skip9 (Girl), I'm Looking Through You, In My Life, skip 12 (Wait), If I Needed Someone, skip 14 (Run for Your Life - even John disliked this one).<br />Hmmm...6 songs out of 14 warrants 2 stars.  And none of the 6 is really a standout.  No rush to buy this one.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This is a fantasy/horor film about the war between the foulest of denizens lurking in the underworld.  Werewolves and Vampires have been locked in a battle that has lasted for centuries.  If this movie is taken at face value and simply enjoyed as a violent, gothic horror story, then it is very entertaining.  The problems arise when I noticed plot flaws and/or parts of the story that were mentioned early then completely forgotten by movie's end.  Also, there are scenes stolen nearly frame-for-frame from &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  Kate Beckinsale, dressed in black latex and wet leather, could very well be Trinity's younger sister.  While I first scoffed at this thievery, I then realized that although they were stolen, they were also pulled off professionally.  I also noticed that the sun never rose during the course of the movie, which conjured images of another gothic-tinged film, &quot;Dark City.&quot;  Some of the acting is sub-par, but this film is not meant to challenge the Oscars for acting achievement.  It is an action film with blood and violence and, to my absolute surprise, a good story.
B00008DDSC|1.0|I enjoy artsy films--this fell flat.  Just plain dumb.  Acting was bad, storyline was bad, continuity was bad---all of it.
B000003T9B|4.0|The 1st Overkill record, like many debut records, has its ups and downs. It's basically a step into more aggressive approach from what was written by Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. And Bobby's vocals are something to be heard. Still, the songs are often simplistic, though catchy, and all the thrash elements are present, like rhythm changes, generally high speed, screaming, guitar solos, etc. Coming from New-York City, Overkill have a certain originality to their thrash when compared to their competitors from Bay Area, and that fact makes them an interesting band to get into. The band only went uphill from here for the next 4 albums, reaching it's peak in 1989 with \\"The Years of Decay\\".<br />Though it's not the most necessary thrash or Overkill record, still it's good enough and deserves a purchase.<BR>But if you want Overkill's best, go for 1989 and 1991 (\\"Horrorscope\\") records.
006028577X|4.0|A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens is a book of being given a second chance.  Ebenezer Scrooge, the main character of the book, is a grumpy old man who feels he has no time for anyone.  As an owner of a firm called Scrooge and Marley's, Scrooge runs the business while Marley has been dead.  On Christmas Eve, exactly seven years from Marley's death, his ghost visits Scrooge.  He tells him that soon three different ghost will visit him during the night.<BR>       As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge.  He is visited by the ghosts because of his rude attitude and his disregard for anyone's attempt to be nice, which we all find ourselves doing now and then.  The past shows Scrooge how he used to be, which was somewhat pleasant but still lonely for Scrooge.  The present shows Scrooge his actions in a way Scrooge has never realized, most of which are to his dislike.  The future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him, actually they are happy that he is gone.  All of these visions has Scrooge sobbing in tears and ready to make changes in his life.<BR>       The book is cleverly written and fun to read.  It often makes you put yourself into Scrooge's situations.  My favorite part of the book is when Scrooge visited the past.  I think it would be great to revisit all of the things you used to have in life.  My least favorite part of the book is when Scrooge is dead in the future, instead of mourning, everyone is interested in his death will.  It would be horrible to leave earth in such a way that all anyone wants is your money.<BR>       As far as recommending the book for others, I believe its a great story especially for the holidays.  If you are into the Christmas glee spirit then you would like the book, especially the ending.  A Christmas Carol can make you angry, cry and laugh all throughout the book.  Its a story of one man whos favorite words, \\"Bah Humbug\\" becomes sincere and realizes all that he can accomplish in life.
B000001ES9|4.0|While this album sounds like 70s rock through and through, that's part of its charm.  There are some classic Rush songs here.  &quot;Finding My Way&quot; and &quot;What You're Doing&quot; are traditional rockers loaded with vitality; while &quot;In the Mood&quot; and &quot;Need Some Love&quot; and &quot;Take a Friend&quot; all have relatively goofy lyrics surrounded by energetic lead and bass guitar. &quot;Before and After&quot; and &quot;Here Again&quot; are both blossoming examples of the talent of Alex Lifeson, with bluesy riffs and memorable solos.  But the song here that put this band on the map is &quot;Working Man.&quot;  The lead-in heavy guitar on this song is now recognized as early promise of their successes to come.  Overall, this is a solid, though fairly straight-forward 70s rock album.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|It almost staggers the mind to think that there may actually be humans alive in the modern world that haven't heard the Beatles, or at least know who they were. But I'm sure that there are those who have only heard a song or two and really wouldn't know where to start if buying that first album.<br />Beatles 1 would make a great place to start any Beatles collection, though you'll find that everyone has their own selection of hit songs that they would have preferred to grace this collection. The songs here all hit the number one spot on the charts thus the title \\"1\\". But every hardcore Beatles fan will no doubt find fault in the selection of some of the songs on this album. To each his own.<br />For that first time purchaser, \\"1\\" will present a look at the different styles and stages the Beatles went through during their 13 year career. From their early period's first single \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", the listener will here the sparce raw energy that first thrilled fans in Liverpool and Hamburg. Then came Beatlemania with songs like \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" which whipped teen aged girls into hysteria. Their middle era was filled with songs that spanned all genres, from the pop rockers \\"Ticket To Ride\\" and \\"Day Tripper\\" to ballads like \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"We Can Work It Out\\".<br />Finishing off this collection of hits are songs from their final stage, poppy rockers like \\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"Get Back\\" and \\"The Ballad Of John and Yoko\\" as well as ballads including \\"Something\\" and \\"Let It Be\\".<br />Technically, the sound could be better. The Beatles general catalog is still using the earliest of remastered versions, all of which are pretty bad, compared to the later released \\"Essential Yellow Submarine Songbook\\" and \\"Let It Be...Naked\\", both of which have been expertly remastered (the later being remixed from the session tapes). True Beatles fans are waiting patiently for EMI to remaster and where needed, remix the entire Beatles catalog and reissue it before we all die off.<br />Obviously, \\"1\\" is a small snapshot of their whole offering and anyone who is serious about having the Beatles on disc should purchase all of their albums on CD. But if you are just starting out and want a good, extremely listenable collection of some of the Beatles best chart toppers, Beatles 1 is a good place to start!re Beatles catalog and reissue it before we all die off.<br />Obviously, \\"1\\" is a small snapshot of their whole offering and anyone who is serious about having the Beatles on disc should purchase all of their albums on CD.

B00005A0N5|5.0|I'll try not to repeat what others have said, and just state, that to me &quot;Oceanborn&quot; is the best Nightwish album. The songwriting here is absolutely great, tracks vary from high-speed power-metal-fests to slow beautiful ballads to good thoughtful instrumentals. And there's fabulous Tarja's operatic vocals soaring over all this. Though other band members are also proficient musicians, you should buy this CD for the vocals alone. This is perhaps one of the best power-metal albums of the 90-ies and will be in place in most melodic metal fans' collections.<BR>Absolutely recommended!
B000006TRV|5.0|Within the Pink Floyd catalog, The Wall, along with Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here are essential. However, if you're relegated to only one album by PF, The Wall supercedes these other albums. This album is not for the faint of heart -- it's long (two full discs) and much of it is dark and less-than-uplifting. But the way the album moves through its paces -- and moves the listener -- is unparalleled. And while much of the &quot;story&quot; of The Wall is dark, the outro to Comfortably Numb, as well as the pounding beat of Run Like Hell, are not only memorable, they are almost inspiring.<br />This is one of those rare instances when the music, the lyrics, the performances and the &quot;feel&quot; of an album all work flawlessly.<br />A must-have.
B000001ESF|4.0|4.5 stars.  This is essential Rush, plain and simple.  The extraordinary epic &quot;2112&quot; is outstanding progressive songwriting at its finest.  The lyrics are excellent as well, with a facinating sci-fi storyline interlaced with magnificent interplay between three of the best musicians I have ever heard.  But the greatness of this album does not end there.  &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot; is loaded with memorable imagery, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; is like remembering a weird dream.  Both &quot;Lessons&quot; and &quot;Something for Nothing&quot; are excellent rock songs with great musicianship.  But there is a down point: &quot;Tears.&quot;  These guys tend to do this on many of their albums.  They write all these great songs and then, just for giggles, they thrown in a lame track just to avoid perfection.  Compared to the rest of the CD, that track does not measure well.  Overall, this album is a must for all Rush fans.
B00005JM20|1.0|Austin Powers might have been annoying, but this is just plain awful.  Not only are there no hard laughs or guffaws, there are no decent laughs period.  This is simply a tedius movie with very few chuckles.  When the two funniest scenes in the movie involve sight gags with Mr. Rowan Atkinson and his gun (accidentally dropping the clip out of his gun and the chamber sliding off his weapon) you know you are buckled into an unfunny ride.  The fault does not lie at the feet of Mr. Rowan, who does a good job with the material.  He's like a modern Peter Sellars.  I wish he was the top choice for future Pink Panther movies instead of Steve Martin. Neither does the fault lie with the script.  Obviously, satirizing this genre has been done to death, but often it can still be funny. Call it old reliable. I'm placing the blame here on bad editing--that is, this film has no sense of comedic timing.  It should have been required that the editors of this movie watch the early Pink Pather films, Casino Royale, and the pre-90's Zucker-Zucker-Abrams movies.  Comedy like this is not genius, it is predictable.  It is the execution of the gag which is funny, and unfortunately, the editors of this film thought they were editing a romantic comedy. Austin Powers succeeded because it was a spoof that spoofed even it's own comedy genre, and because it had good direction and good editing.  They went into it thinking they had a unique spoof.  Johnny English fails because it is routine and it didn't even have the guts to go balls-out comedy because it was relying on the premise to carry the whole movie.  Because the editing was more appropriate for a John Hughes movie.  Because James Bond himself does a better job of satirizing the genre.  Save your rental money on this one.  Rent the first three Pink Panthers instead.  Or, just rent some non-Sean Connery James Bond flicks.  They are a better laugh.
B000002IOJ|4.0|This album, while being a quality thrash record with it's healthy dose of tight riffage and fast solos, has one thing that spoils it all. It's the accurately copied sound of Metallica during their &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; era. I know, that it was the ultimate thrash album, and all that, but I think any band needs to have it's own distinctive style. My relative dissapointment of this is made bigger, because I know that Testament ARE capable of producing their own music. They proved it on their debut &quot;The Legacy&quot; (the record that I highly recommend to any thrash fan), and proved it yet again in the middle of the 90-s with their heavier material.<br />Such as it is, this record can only be recommended to 2 categories of listeners: 1) those who love thrash and want to explore every bit of it, and 2) those who feel cheated by Metallica's evolution in the 90s. Oh, and to dedicated Testament fans too. After all, this is a quality, if a little unoriginal thrash-metal.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked about one month ago, and haven't been able to stop talking about it since!  It is my favorite play after Rent (another soundtrack you must buy if you don't already own it.)  Many critics have said that the score is the weakest aspect of Wicked, calling the music unmemorable.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  The music on this CD is catchy and wonderful.  &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and &quot;Popular,&quot; which showcase the incredible voices of Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth, are absolutely unbelievable.  &quot;The Wizard and I,&quot; &quot;Loathing,&quot; &quot;Dancing through Life,&quot; &quot;Thank Goodness,&quot; &quot;As Long as You're Mine,&quot; and others really stand out as well.  As a Rent fan, I am partial to Idina Menzel, and adore every song to which she lends her voice--both rock-belting and gentle (as in &quot;I'm Not thar Girl.&quot;)  Kristen Chenoweth also excels, and you can hear her acting through her vocal flexibility.  These two alone are enough to buy the CD, but unforgettable tunes and stellar lyrics make this CD a must-have.
0393325172|5.0|This series' greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.  It is uncompromising in language and detail regarding its setting. This makes the book enthralling for those who wish to be transported to another time and place but very challenging for those unfamiliar with nautical language.  Nor is it only those who cannot distinguish between tacking and wearing who will be challenged because the authenticity extends not only to the language of the sea but also to the language of the sea as it was 200 years ago.  And it is authentic as to language and custom of the enormous bureaucracy that was the 19th century Royal Navy.  And one of the main characters is a doctor so you better be familar with the language and customs of the medicine of 200 years ago.  And the two main characters share a love for the music of 200 years ago so if you are to understand you better know an aire from a cadenza.  The doctor is a naturalist by avocation (referred to as a &quot;philospher&quot;) and it would help if one were familar with Linneaus' work in botany and the other natural sciences as they were understood 200 years ago.  And then there are the social conventions and political disputes of early 19th century England which inform the characters' actions.  Finally, no attempt has been made to transform the opinions of the characters into opinions acceptable to our politically correct society.  For example, homosexuality (referred to as &quot;pederastry&quot;) is included in a realistic and unapproving way.  <br />If there is any compromise for the 20th (or 21st) century reader, it consists of only two elements.  First, the doctor begins as a lubber and thus something of a foil which allows O'Brien to have a midshipman instruct him (and us) on certain matters nautical.  Second, I suspect that spelling is more standardized here than it was 200 years ago.  Nevertheless the beauty of the language of yesteryear rings clear across the centuries.  (As I write this we are being subjected totelevised political debates that are occasionally good for a chuckle but the language of which provides stark and unfavorable comparison to the King's English as it was spoken when the 17th century turned into the 18th.)<BR>  <BR>In summary, this is a challenging book that allows you to adventure in a foreign place and time with all of its warts and blemishes but that requires either an extraordinary amount of knowledge of the era or frequent reference to authority if you are to bask in its luxury.  (I bought A Sea of Words by Dean King, a book specifically designed as a reference for O'Brien readers, to help me through some of the rough spots.) If you like to be spoon fed, this is not the book for you and you should immediately watch Pirates of the Caribbean.  If you like to learn something as well as adventure, even with the burden of resorting to references, this is the book for you.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|This new packaging of the Monty Python classic is to be cherished by Python fans as much (if not more) for the extras as for the film itself. I have always been a Python fan, and must confess that I actually prefer the series to the films, but the classic scenes in this film make it a must see.<br />The film was shot on a shoestring budget (funded largely by rock music celebrities) in horrible, wet weather by a small cast and crew, with direction from first time directors Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. The net result is a quasi-historical, utterly warped film about King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights in their search for the Holy Grail. Many entertaining diversions follow, including encounters with the 'Knights Who Say Ni' (my very favorite part of the entire film), a killer rabbit, plus a visit to the surprisingly appealing Castle Anthrax.<br />The extras are what make this version so desirable. Included on the two disc set are numerous diversions, including a couple of documentaries (one made in 1974 on location, and one made for this release.) One of the highlights of this package is the documentary &quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations!&quot; in which Terry Jones and Michael Palin take us on visits to the locations where the film was shot. It is a very interesting and entertaining documentary with footage from the movie compared with how the areas look now; of particular interest are the interior views of the castles.<br />Also included is a collectible film cel made for this edition and a printed copy of the screenplay, so you can follow along, or clear up hard to decipher lines. This and many other little gems on the CD's (such as two scenes from the Japanese version, and a skit in which an older Michael Palin demonstrates uses for coconuts) make this a worthwhile addition to any video library.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This was the best cd of 2003...maybe all time. Every song is something you can relate to. I have heard a cd as good as this in a while. The vocals are the best hands down. On this cd Christina reminds me of Mariah at her best. Christina lets all the gloss and pretense go. This is an album that everyone cna listen to. This album really gives you a guide to how she has grown. Unlike Britney's new crap, this is actually good. You can actually see her grow. Instead of throwing in a song about  crusing the clubs for boys, you see the pain, heartache and all the emotions that come with growing up. The thing that seperates Christina from the Britneys and Ashanti's and the Beyonces is there is actual TALENT. There is something that everyone can relate to. This album has everything. Ballads, rock, gospel, soul etc. This is simply a great album....best I have heard in a while.......
0393317552|5.0|This is one of the best school books i have ever read.  I know i have weird interests, but it merges evolutionary biology with history.  Yes it has a seemingly polically correct premise, but in the end, Europe is not the only culture in the world.  WAKE UP.

0575041714|5.0|There are, I believe, a couple dozen titles now in the Discworld series, but this one -- the fourth -- is still one of the best. Death, who SPEAKS IN ALL CAPITALS, and takes his job seriously, decides nevertheless that he's in need of a break. So he takes on an apprentice, a young farm lad named Mortimer -- Mort for short. On his first solo soul-collecting assignment, Mort discovers he can't allow the teenaged Princess Keli to be assassinated by her uncle the Duke, tries to prevent what is supposed to happen -- what *must* happen -- and, of course, messes thing up. Reality tends to heal itself in the long run, though, and there's no way the kid can stop history from getting back on its proper track. But he's certainly going to try. As one might expect in a Pratchett yarn, things get a bit out of hand after that, especially when Death goes AWOL for a time, trying out human experiences and vices, and when Mort begins taking on more and more of his boss's characteristics. After all, as Mort explains to Death's adopted daughter, Ysabell, DEATH IS WHOEVER DOES DEATH'S JOB. The final confrontation between Mort and Death is a marvelous set-piece. Can Mort win? Can Death lose? Is it even fair? THERE IS NO JUSTICE, as Death is fond of remarking. THERE'S ONLY ME.

0671027344|5.0|This book took me completely by surpise.  It is a poignant story of a boy in high school the epitomizes the &quot;coming of age&quot; novel.  Chbosky's character Charlie belongs in the ranks of Catcher in the Rye's Holden Caulfield as being an epic voice for youthful sorrows and celebrations.  This book is absolutely beautiful.
6303402348|5.0|\\"Run Forrest Run\\" was my favorite line in the movie!  Tom Hanks played the main actor Forrest Gump.  The actress that Forrest Gump was in love with was Robin Wright who was Jenny Curran in the movie.  In the beginning of the movie Forrest had many problems with his legs, and he wasn't considered \\"normal\\" in his school.  He had an I.Q. of 75, which is considered to be dumb.  Forrest was not smart, and even when he had bad legs, he still turned out a great man.  He met many presidents, and many famous people.  He was named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, who started the Ku Klux Klan.  Forrest Gump was a wonderful movie with the great soundtrack put into the movie.  I think that without a soundtrack the movie would seem long and not as interesting.  I loved the movie Forrest Gump.  Although some parts I wish would not happen.  At the end, I wish that Jenny would live so Forrest could be so much happier with her.  I wish she had done that kind of stuff she did in her past, which ended up with her receiving HIV and dying at a young age.  In the end, she has a child Forrest Jr., she marries Forrest, then she gets sick, and she dies.  Many times, she was with Forrest and she became scared and left.  Many times Jenny gets scared and so she just runs, because she thinks running away from your problems is better than facing them.  Which is not true, I believe that if you keep running away from your problems they are going to build up and then in the end whether you want to or not you have to face them.  You problems will always chase you until you solve them and figure them out and live out the consequences.  Especially one of the times Jenny left him, he ran off.  He ran across the United States four times, which took him 3 years 2, months, 14 days, and 16 hours.  He had some tough times but he also had some great times.  Some of the tough times he had to face was growing up without a father, getting picked on by bullies, having leg problems, being considered \\"dumb,\\" and most of all losing his best friend in the army Bubba Blue.  Forrest had rough times but also had some great times.  He met many famous and great people like Elvis Presley, who is the King of Rock and Roll.  He met George Wallace one time while he was picking up Vivian's Malone's book as Wallace was standing in the schoolhouse door at the University of Alabama.  He met Abby Hoffman who was an anti war demonstration person.  John Lennon and Dick Cavett, when on Cavett's television show.  He met a few presidents like John F. Kennedy when he was a member of the all American football team.  He met Lyndon Johnson receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Richard Nixon as a member of the All-American Ping Pong team.  I would be the happiest person ever if I got to meet people like Forrest Gump did.   The actor who played Forrest Gump was Tom Hanks who is a wonderful actor and is so amazingly awesome, was the best actor to act for the film Forrest Gump.  Not only is he a great actor, but he lived the part of Forrest Gump.  The movie racked up about 500 million at the box office. At the time that the movie was going on their was also a war.  Forrest Gump and his best friend Bubba Blue were also in the Vietnam war, and Forrest saved everyone including Lieutenant Dan.  He got mostly everyone except Bubba Blue, who was too injured and died.  He then later owned a shrimp boat company because he made a promise to Bubba Blue that he would.  So he did, and became highly successful in life.
0596000480|3.0|Reading this book will help you to understand what javascript is and how to use it. Most of all the different concepts of Javascript are explained with examples. That's I rate it 3 stars. But 40% of the interesting examples are not working properly(the most of time seeking where the fault in the given example is).

B000002J09|5.0|Words are not enough to describe the greatness of this CD and band. The first song, Black Dog, opens up the album with a smashing riff that will get you picking up your guitar and playing it yourself. I heard the next song, Rock and roll years before I even knew who Led Zeppelin was. The battle of Evermore is another great song building up to the climax of the greatest song of all time, Stairway to Heaven. Next, misty mountain hop, another great song showing that zeppelin can, in fact play blues. Four sticks is next, a tribute to John Bonham I believe. Next is going to California, changing the pace to a nice slow rythm. The album ends with \\"When the Levee breaks\\" covered from Memphis Minnie.<br />Overall, a truly amazing album. Robert Plant's voice is amazing! There isn't an artist today that can sing like that, John Bohnam keeps beat perfectly, Jimmy Page IS the best guitarist of all time (black dog proves it) and John Paul Jones truly is an amazing bass player.<br />Finishing, I would just like to say BUY THIS ALBUM, don't listen to the bad reviewers who don't have a single Iq point put together.<br />Other good bands are Warren Zevon, Ac/Dc, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Deep Purple, Rolling stones, Pink Floyd, Cream, Eric clapton, The Doors, The Sex Pistols, Tom Petty and Black Sabbath.
B00006L83N|4.0|...I do like this album. But for some reason, i guess i just cannot see what the big deal is. I only own this and &quot;V - The New Mythology Suite&quot; by Symphony X, but I must say &quot;V&quot; is FAR better than this. In fact, the only really great song on here is the 24 minute epic title track, which is EXCELLENT. The rest of the songs are good to forgettable(not bad, just well.....forgettable). If you really want an album that displays this bands talent, pick up &quot;V&quot; first.
B00005JMFR|1.0|The first one was very well crafted.  The second one, had too much in the way of fights and special effects that clouded the story.  This one, just plain sucked. This movie had only special effects and fights.  If you saw number two, well ignore Neo's choice to defend Zion and assume he just inserted himself into the Matrix.  In the end, two hours of additional film later, that is all that happened.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys' latest album is one of the most impressing CD in 2003 when there have been mostly disappointments. It takes all the things that made Songs in A Minor such an appealing album and improved it by 100 percent while adding new sounds and new rhythmns. Who would have thought that Alicia would be making a classic retro song with Timbaland of all people? While her up tempo tracks like Karma, Heartburn, and So Simple show that Alicia can truly be a hip hop/r&amp;b leader like Mary J. Blige, it's her true SOUL music where she shines. If I Ain't Got You is a song that will bring tears to your eyes when you hear it for the very first time with its raw emotion and stunning arrangements. Diary, probably the best song on the album is an amazing track with a male/female call and answer section likely to make you want to hit the repeat button again and again. Wake Up is another song that brings Alicia to the roots of soul when most R&amp;B artists nowadays make generic homogenized crap. The compositions have improved, as well as the lyrics when Alicia used to overly belt out song songs on her first album. Just overall a much better effort than her first one, which was already very above average.<br />Favorite songs:<BR>- Karma<BR>- If I Ain't Got You<BR>- Diary<BR>- Wake Up
B00006FDCD|5.0|this movie was great.  i watched it once as a kid and was terrified beyond belief.  now i'm 23, and i still cover my eyes on some parts.  stephen king has been the master of horror all the way back to the christine days.  he really did it this time though.  this movie was intended to give you the creeps more than anything else.  for instance, the atmosphere of the town was always wet and gloomy.  plus, pennywise appears in the weirdest places like the shower room and graveyard scene, which adds to the scares.  it is a very unique movie.  it's make you develop a phobia of clowns that will stick with you for quite a while.  i only wish they could have included tim reid in the final parts of the film (him being one of the main chars and all).<BR>one last thing, the gas station scene has to be the creepiest scene i've ever watched in a horror movie.
B00005JLXE|4.0|The last time I saw a live version of Daredevil and the Kingpin was in Trial of the Incredible Hulk and it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for (sorry John Rhys Davies). After that I wasn't sure what to expect from a Daredevil movie, but this time around I was pleasantly surprised. I imagine that Daredevil was a tricky hero to capture on film since he began largely as a Spiderman copy and then as time went on developed into something much more interesting. I suppose they could have gone with the earlier version of him, but I'm glad they chose to focus on the darker devil instead of the incarnation of the early days (sorry Stiltman). Despite the fact that he was too much like Spiderman and thus a second stringer, I enjoyed Daredevil's classic 60's adventures and there was always a certain amount of fanciful moments and villains that were far from realistic, but provided much needed escapism. This film entertained me in the same way while drawing on the more recent version of the character to make him something different and more individual. <BR>I liked this film a lot and thought it got far more right than wrong. It's too bad they jumped the gun in order to get the Elektra movie off the ground while Jen Garner is hot (and how hot she is) instead of saving some of these characters and situations for later films, but I still thought this was a vast improvement over the version of the characters given to us in Trial Of The Incredible Hulk and far closer to the characters in the book than I expected. Despite some changes I thought the dedication to the comic was obvious and darned impressive and it was a lot closer than most super hero films I've watched. I do have mixed feelings about the fight scene where Murdock basically gives away his identity by flaunting his abilities in order to woo Elektra, but I must admit I enjoyed it even if it is silly. I have to give Daredevil it's due for providing me with an entertaining few hours and bringing some of my favorite characters to the screen in an entertaining way.
078681859X|5.0|All I can say is Harry and Artemis better watch out!  This was a very good read, one of the best I have had in a long time.  The story itself is indepth, invigorating, and leaves you practically drooling for more.  As if that wasn't enough the book is also hilarious.  This altogether makes for a fantastic read, which I strongly recommend.
B00005JMTN|4.0|I knew it would be a tear jerker when I heard \\" They stopped<BR>the chemo today\\" Gosh this movie brought back memories of my pa<BR>and me. We never talked either, until his last days.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Fantastic movie, one of the best I've seen in quite some time. A wonderful release from reality, if you want to get away from the cold for a while and get caught up in a brilliant fantasy! This is not a movie to be overanalyzed, but rather one you should simply sit back, relax, enjoy and savor. The visuals are stunning, the tales are amusing and heartfelt, and the characters are likable. Definitely deserves some Oscar nods!
B000127LW2|5.0|VOYAGER is, by far the best Star Trek ever. I grew up on watching TNG and DS9, but in 1995, VOYAGER began its legacy. The unique story, and interesting characters is where VOYAGER shines the most.  The best thing about VOYAGER, however is that all the characters, (and I mean all of them) Evolve or change drasticly from the begginning to end.  I simply love this show, I think it is the best Sci Fi show of all time and I cant wait for the DVD of season one, to seven.<br />As for the DVD special Features...it looks like paramount is improving with every Star Trek set they come out with.  This set has new and old interveiws, several documentaries (Real Science sounds particualrily interesting) even footage from their first choice as Captain Kathryn Janeway, Genevieve Bujold. Which will also be very interesting.  VOYAGER came out right when the internet was becoming increasingly popular, so website desinger and producer of the show: Marc Wade, explains and shows how an interactive VOYAGER website was created to help launch the series.  On Location with the kazon has some interesting behind the scenes look at the kazons in the pilot episode.  And finally RED ALERT!: Visual Effects season one has an interesting look at all the special effects done on the first season.<br />So mark FEB 24th on your calanders fellow fans of VOYAGER, and get ready for the best Trek series to launch on DVD. And by the way, i noticed that when they first come out, the TNG and DS9 DVDs came packaged with an extra disc, most likely there will be one for the VOYAGER ones, so look out for that when buying the product.  VOYAGER Rules!
6305127638|5.0|Even though Star Trek: Generations was a good first entry in The Next Generation era of feature films, it wasn't until Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga wrote Star Trek: First Contact's story and screenplay that Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew proved that they could carry a Trek film without help from The Original Series' cast.<br />It also helped that the film was more action-oriented than Star Trek VII.  Sure, the last battle of the NCC-1701 D was impressive and the brief meeting of Captains James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard did provide Trek fans with some exciting and moving moments, but what fans really wanted was a muscular...action movie with a mission (and antagonists) worthy of the Next Generation crew and the new, top-of-the line Enterprise E.<br />Star Trek: First Contact brings back the Borg, a race of half-organic, half cybernetic beings whose goal is to destroy other races by assimilating their technology and transforming the survivors by injecting microscopic nanoprobes that turn humans, Vulcans, El-Aurians -- anyone, really -- into unfeeling, relentless drones.  As fans of the 1987-1994 syndicated series know, Capt. Picard was once captured by the Borg and transformed into Locutus, a Borg strategist/spokesdrone whose intimate knowledge of Starfleet technology,its tactics and its officers nearly spelled certain defeat for the Federation at the Battle of Wolf 359.<br />Now, several years later, the Borg are back and meaner than ever.  Having been thwarted more than once in the 24th Century by Picard and his crew, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) leads a single-cubeship invasion force into Federation space, hoping to defeat the Federation by either conquering Earth in a battle against Starfleet...or tinkering with the timeline and going back to the 21st Century to prevent humanity's first contact with another spacefaring race.<br />Actor Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. Will Riker) makes his feature film directing debut in this eighth installment of the Star Trek movie series, and although he would only direct the weaker Star Trek: Insurrection, he does a great job at helming a very high-octane action flick that involves time travel, space battles, a strong Picard/Data storyline and elements from The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and the then-still new Voyager.<br />Guest stars James Cromwell (The Sum of All Fears, Babe) and Alfre Woodward join the cast of TNG as warp-drive inventor Zefram Cochrane and his friend and assistant Lily, who add a certain mixture of edginess and wit to the film.  Cromwell fares particularly well as Cochrane, a character first seen in The Original Series episode Metamorphosis. While Cromwell doesn't remotely look like the then-30 or 40-something Glen Corbett, he portrays the legendary \\"father of warp drive\\" as a very human and flawed genius -- he is cranky, cynical and drinks way too much -- who is bemused by the hero-worship he receives from the Enterprise crew.  He also gets some of the best lines. (My favorite: \\"You're astronauts...on some kind of star trek?\\")<br />Also contributing to the excitement is Jerry Goldsmith's score, a mixture of a lovely new main theme and such familiar touchstones as Alexander Courage's fanfare for the Original Series theme and Goldsmith's own \\"Main Theme\\" for Star Trek's first feature film (and later adapted as The Next Generation's main title).<br />Although First Contact does require some familiarity with the Star Trek universe and its history, it's clearly among the best of the 10 in the series.th installment of the Star Trek movie series, and although he would only direct the weaker Star Trek: Insurrection, he does a great job at helming a very high-octane action flick that involves time travel, space battles, a strong Picard/Data storyline and elements from The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and the then-still new Voyager.<br />Guest stars James Cromwell (The Sum of All Fears, Babe) and Alfre Woodward join the cast of TNG as warp-drive inventor Zefram Cochrane and his friend and assistant Lily, who add a certain mixture of edginess and wit to the film.

B000002H33|5.0|I can't really say much more than that this album is absolutly amazing.  This isn't just Metallica's best, but one of the best metal albums ever.  Every song is masterfully written, from crazy drum riffs to shredding guitar solos, this album is what you compare other albums to.  It really takes talent to write an 8 minute song and keep it flowing, and they do that perfectly with the title track.  I had this album on cassette tape for years and didn't even realize how long the song was until I got the CD.<br />The production on this album is also great.  People complain that Ride the Lightning is too raw sounding and that there's no bass in And Justice For All, but this one is solid.  They also did a good job on moving the tracks from tape to CD.<br />So anyway, make this legendary album a part of your collection and feel the power of METALLICA!!!!
6305313687|5.0|In a word, this film is fabulous.<br />It is an emotionally engaging, heartrending experience, essentially unlike anything I have ever seen before.  <br />It is a shame that this movie remains relatively unknown--it is certainly comparable to some of the greatest \\"classic\\" films that people tout much more openly: the stark, unflinching way in which it addresses some of the darkest elements not only of our society, but of the individual, is unforgettable.<br />This is THE film for anyone who is looking for a thought-provoking, stirring, and unbelievably raw work.  <br />Norton (who, incidentally, ended up contributing a great deal in the post-production process after the director effectively abandoned the project) delivers a fabulous and haunting performance.  <br />NOTE: This film is not for everyone.  Approach with an open mind, or stay away.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld is nothing more than what the cover shows: a slick looking action movie with vampires and werewolves. That is all it really needs to be, in my opinion. This movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does have some tightly shot action sequences, and Kate Beckinsale breathes uncommon life into the usual cardboard cut-out 'bad girl'.
B000066C6Z|4.0|I've been a fan of the ZAZ team for as long as I can remember.  And this is one of their classic films- Top Secret!  spoofs both Elvis musicals and doubleya-doubleya two films- and does it really well.  There's sight gags, background gags, puns, a scene shot entirely in reverse, an underwater saloon fight, what else do you want in a movie?  I've watched Top Secret!  on a regular basis for 15 years, whether it's the version I taped off of TV or the DVD, and am still not bored with it.  I always find some new gag that somehow escaped me in previous viewings.  While Top Secret!  isn't as well known as Airplane!, it's just as hilarious.  Watching it with the commentary is not advised- it's quite possibly the worst commentary track I've come across and it's mostly just a bunch of guys laughing.  A note- the &quot;alternate scenes&quot; featured in the DVD were re-inserted for the TV version of the movie.
B00008EYA5|3.0|SWAT is what it is: beautiful people shooting guns and foiling crime. There is no high art here, but who really expected there to be? The 'story' is threadbare, as usual, but the action sequences are directed well and nicely shot.

B00005JMCT|3.0|While this wasn't the strongest of the three 'Pie' movies, I really enjoyed it. I think that some of the secondary characters suffered a bit from lack of screentime, but the overall story was just as good as the other 2 movies.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|I honestly can't remember the first time I watched Alien...its one of those movies that's just always been there as part of my film psyche.  To me, this is the biggest testament to its enduring appeal - a landmark for science fiction, horror, and the history of cinema in general.  It's difficult to overstate the significance of this film and its role in defining a genre - just think of the number of subsequent movies that pitch an ill-prepared and frightened rabble against a solitary unknown alien/ witch/ tooth-fairy beast...usually in the confines of a steam filled labyrinth.  Dry-ice sales alone owe a great debt to this film.<br />Clearly it wasn't just MY imagination that was sparked.  James Cameron also thought the idea was a peachy one; he followed up with the equally acclaimed `Aliens' (damn clever title too) and succeeded in rounding out a deliciously dark universe with plenty of great (Oscar-winning) special effects, memorable characters and rollercoaster action (\\"Punch it Bishop!!\\").<br />The third movie, the adroitly named `Alien3' suffered famously from studio interference and this is reflected in the somewhat directionless pace and backtracking that mars an otherwise consistently striking performance from Sigourny Weaver as Ripley, a character by now ingrained in Sci-Fi gospel.  The, at times, ungainly special effects don't really help matters, but at heart this sequel of a sequel remains a flawed but highly enjoyable romp through an expanded and nightmarish universe.<br />So what was left to say?  Well, the Joss `Buffy' Whedon treatment of the Alien: Resurrection script seemed to have much to add...the underlying themes of genetic tampering and perverted sense of responsibility are powerful indeed, but somehow got lost in the gloopy splatty drooly effects overkill.  The bizarre choice of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet, of Amelie (and, City of Lost Children) fame did at least pay off in the lavish visual style of the film, with good production values and some choice scenic set pieces clawing the film back from the brink.<br />This collection then, sporting its smash hit vs. loveable miss lineup, is absolutely crammed with extra features, and it should be applauded that the Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection discs are as consistently interesting and well presented as the others.<br />Indeed, this goes a long way to explaining how both the fans and the moviemakers themselves regard this series - as one big happy family.<br />Like any family there are troublemaker and oddballs, but with a nostalgic heart it's easy to embrace them as a whole.  Featuring both original release and director's cut editions for all four films means that fans and film-buffs alike can compare and contrast each episode, and the shear weight of features should bring a giddy smile to any Alien aficionado.  All wrapped up in a stylishly embossed presentation case that positively sizzles with acid blood, this collection would make a worthy addition to the shelves of any Sci-Fi fan, but will be the pride and joy of any true Bug Stomper.es and some choice scenic set pieces clawing the film back from the brink.<br />This collection then, sporting its smash hit vs. loveable miss lineup, is absolutely crammed with extra features, and it should be applauded that the Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection discs are as consistently interesting and well presented as the others.  <br />Indeed, this goes a long way to explaining how both the fans and the moviemakers themselves regard this series - as one big happy family. <BR>Like any family there are troublemaker and oddballs, but with a nostalgic heart it's easy to embrace them as a whole.

B0000033OZ|5.0|This debut album(now CD!) from ELP is one of their best!!! It contains &quot;Lucky Man&quot;,one of the band's biggest hits!!! But the rest of the album is awesome too!!! Great musicianship!!! A classic album!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+
B0000DD7LB|4.0|ThIs CD iSn'T BaD....<BR>but well, it isn't GREAT. A few of the songs are really catchy like,#2(I got that)Boom Boom, #6 Toxic, #7 Outrageous, and #13 Me against the music remix. But the rest are just kinda boring. The girl can't sing either... but if your looking for an upbeat party CD, pick this one up!

B00008NRI8|4.0|I thought that this film had a rather unusual storyline, although the outcome of the relationship between the main characters was quite predictable! I did enjoy it, and found myself cracking up.<br />Good points: Along with all the character flaws both Wade and Kelson have, the film is careful to develop redeemable character traits along the way as well, making both characters human rather than unsalvageably neurotic. Very human in-fact, I know people in real life like these two. They're also careful to show that both characters do actually have similar interests in life so it's not completely head-scratching to see them falling for each other. Oh and the romance is never sappy, so for those who are a fan of subtle expressions, furtive glances and baffled reactions, this is the film for you. Bullock and Grant might be playing their usual roles but those roles are definitely very compatible, at least in this film. Chemistry is present and makes the film work.<br />  So by all means go out and buy this film. I think that if you're into romantic comedies, you'll love this one.

B00005JMTN|4.0|this was a very sweet story of father and son.the stories the father told maybe have been like a fairly tale but this movie touch my heart. the story i liked best was when edward when into that one town and everybody in it was barefooted no one wore shoes that would have been my type of town to live in. the bath tub edward scene with his wife touched me a lot. like i said this is just a sweet story.

B000003CMB|5.0|I've listened to this CD more than anyone could imagine. I'll put it down for a month or two and come back to it,not being able to stop playing it for another couple of months.  This has been going on for some 25 years now.   I love Hendrix, Clapton,Page,Vaughn, Winter,Beck, etc... but there is something about the raw honesty that I hear when Duane Allman starts playing.  I've heard and read comments about how some of his solos seem to go on and on. Granted, they are long, but they are journeys that let you in on his improvisational path.  The fact that these solos aren't so seamless, shows that his music is very much in tune with the way life goes sometime.  Yet, his intonation is one of hope.  The live version of Whipping Post , truly backs this statement.  I think people really need to listen to these compositions and get away from rating them as air guitar worthy. This CD is air guitar worthy, I also recomend headphones.
B000002UAX|5.0|This great classic 2 album(2 CD's these days!)set is awesome!!! Lots of great Beatles classics are here:While My Guitar Gently Weeps,Back In The USSR,Helter Skelter,Yer Blues,Savoy Truffle,Birthday,Dear Prudence,I'm So Tired,Rocky Raccon,Piggies,Blackbird,Martha My Dear,Don't Pass Me By,I Will,Revolution 1,Sexy Sadie,Ob La Di, Ob La Da,Happiness Is Warm Gun and more!!!

0385472951|4.0|The first time I came across this book I was at my grandma's house and I was reading a Tom Clancy novel and she told me about this book called The Partner by John Grisham. So I went to the book store and read the back cover and I was instantly interested. I started to read and I couldn't put it down. It was a real page turner. This was the first John Grisham Novel that I had read and his characters always keep you wondering what they are going to do next. The book was full of surprises and the ending is a complete surprise. You would have never guessed it would happen. I would recommend this book to everyone but especially to people like books with surprises.
0812550706|5.0|Of books ..big ones little ones, tall ones short ones..text, fiction..drama , history ,classics..what ya got'?? So When I say That this book is a revalation...do you believe me? If you puzzle over art immitating life, or the reverse  .. than read this amazing little book and ask yourself the question again..WOW ! Good and Evil are human qualities or are they.....universal boundries ? Like On and Off ? I couldn't put it down, and I had to read it again to be sure I wasn't just overwhelmed....BRILLIANT !
B0000B1OFL|4.0|John Bridger, an aging robber, helps out with one last job before passing the reins over to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Charlie Croker.  The job: to steal a safe full of gold bricks from a heavily guarded house in Venice, Italy.  The plan goes without a hitch until the team is double-crossed by Steve, one of its own members, who kills Bridger and believes the others dead.<br />A year later, Charlie's been searching for Steve and the gold bricks and finally tracks them down to Los Angeles.  With the aid of Bridger's daughter Stella, a top-notch safecracker working on the right side of the law, the team plots to exact revenge on Steve and to steal back the gold bricks.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The script takes a back seat to the action sequences: the opening heist in Venice with a power boat chase through the canals to the Mini Coopers racing through the Metro of LA to the carfeully planned re-routing of armored cars via hacking into the traffic mainframe.  The actors work very well together: Donald Southerland as John Bridger; Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker; Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger; Jason Statham as Handsome Rob who has a way with cars and women;  Mos Def as Left Ear, an expert safecracker; Seth Green as Lyle the computer genius; and Edward Norton as Steve, the double-crosser.<br />The DVD extras are prettygood, especially the documentary about the car chase sequence throught he Metro tunnels.  This is a fast-paced, exciting movie sure to get your adrenaline pumping
0446677450|5.0|One reviewer said he wanted &quot;to believe in Kiyosaki.&quot; Others clearly don't. Why do you have to believe or not believe in the guy? He wrote a book that has a great philosophy: don't look at money as the answer. Design your desired lifestyle (big or small) and devote yourself to building assets that provide income to meet its expenses. Really, it's the same goal as anyone's retirement strategy--but you set your own timeline, and you don't depend on anyone else to provide your &quot;pension.&quot; I'm embarrassed that I didn't think of this so clearly before I read the book.<br />The guy promotes his own products, sure. He says right in the book that he's not the &quot;best-writing author.&quot; He's a sales guy. More power to him.<br />He doesn't really tell you the steps to make the assets, other than telling you to become as financially smart as you can. He tells you to find your own resources and learn so that you can build your assets intelligently. How is that bad advice?<br />He seems to disdain education, but he actually just says that he believes that it's outmoded in many ways. Frankly, he has valid points. I have a masters degree and enjoy learning for its own sake, but I can tell you that education is a tool like any other in life, and not everyone is cut out for the same educational path. You make your own educational paths for your own needs, and much of my most valuable learning took place outside of the traditional classroom.<br />Some of his stories seem far-fetched, but as the Millionaire Mind book (that many people are recommending in these reviews) will tell you, people of great net worth learn to take opportunities and manage risk--often, the greater the opportunity the greater the risk.<br />I would not take any of his examples (I think of them as parables, actually) and use them--that's directly against the advice of the book. The book gives you the guy's way of looking at money and tells you to go start the rest yourself. He gives yousome good extended reading tips in the back of the book to help build your skills and philosophy.<br />I'd recommend this book for a beginner who needs to get a good perspective on how to look at personal finance. I would not recommend it for a person who wants concrete investment advice. I would especially not recommend it to a person who will read it and run out to implement the thing as a how-to book--that is not what it is.<br />I would also not take the book as seriously as many of the reviewers do. I would especially not base my entire life strategy on one book or author. This is a good read, and I loved the ideas. Take from it what you want and &quot;file&quot; the rest.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, why not I like movies about vampires and wearwolves.  This one has a lot of familiar looks and action.  For some it might be too familiar as it simulates a bit of matrix in its look and style.  There is a tail about love and the cause for the war beginning that seems could have been played up more and you really don't quite get what its all about until you reach the end of the movie.  All through the movie you do seem to be left hopeing for more action and chemistry between the two main characters, and yet you can almost understand the hesitations.  <br />The movie moves along quickly and smoothly enough though that any disappointment in the lack of chemistry displayed between them doesn't seem to bother you much.  It doesn't drag on and on like some reviewers might make you think.<BR>  <BR>the thing that kind of threw me was why no female wearwolfs. <br />It could have had a little more original style and costumes, but it was still a good movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Imagine a world where the everyone is Han-Solo or Dirty Harry, then throw in the X-files conspiracy guys and Bonnie, the cute mechanic from Knight Rider.<br />Firefly is hard-core, old-school sci-fi. The characters and world are rough, dirty, and dangerous.  Technology only gets the characters into trouble, not out of it (smart wits and a steady trigger finger get them out of trouble).  There is no sound in space.  If your space-ship breaks outside the solar system, you don't invent a warp drive.  You run out of air and die.<br />This show is smart, funny, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It pains me to admit that the one season is worth the whole runs of Star Trek, Babylon 5, FarScape, StarGate, etc.  Buy it now.<br />-m
0385507755|5.0|Certainly unlike anything I have read before, this novel will grab you from the opening paragraph and hurtle you along on a wild ride.  A powerful and provocative look at the world of addiction, complete with a cast of characters undoubtably being chosen by Hollywood as we speak(I'm hoping for James Gandolfini in the role of Leonard) The author's unconventional style of writing does take some getting used to, but it keeps you on your toes and adds to the overall feel of unease.  In many ways this novel is like a bad car accident, you are repulsed and fascinated at the same time. This book speaks to the stranglehold of addiction and offers no apologies for the author's unorthodox philosophies on recovery.  It's certainly not to everyone's tastes, but there is no denying the author has captured the essence of something that most of us will be fortunate never to experience.  4.5 stars
B00005JLZN|1.0|I still can't see what \\"the point\\" was that the movie supposedly makes in \\"a compelling and interesting way\\".  Was its point supposed to be that innocent people can be and sometimes are put to death under US law?  If so, then its point is silly, because most of us already acknowledge this fact (however we stand on the issue of the death penalty). There is nothing profound or enlightening, or even interesting, about the point at all, if that is what it is supposed to be.<br />Or is the movie's point supposed to be that extremists sometimes go to great lengths to prove things that everyone already acknowledges?  Maybe that's true.  But the Life of David Gale not only has a \\"slim\\" possibility of transpiring in \\"real life\\", but actually is impossible to take seriously WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE STORY ITSELF, because David Gale is supposed to be not just an extremist but also a very intelligent person.  Why would SUCH A PERSON go to *any* lengths to prove something already so obvious as the fact that innocents can and are sometimes put to death under US law?
B00009TB5G|5.0|Wow, I got mine and I still can't get enough of it. I am inclined to agree with some reviwers: I prefer the films to the books, just because the books are written in such an obscure manner. Take the &quot;cheesy&quot; lines with humor and no one better disrespect Christopher Lee.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is a great singer---nice voice, fine phrasing, and good taste in material. He readily admits his admiration for the late, great Bobby Darin and it shows in Buble's vocal style. Nice to know there are still some young singers who appreciate classic pop standards. Highly recommended.
0385504209|5.0|This book was awesome!!! One of the best I've ever read. It keeps you on the edge of your seat til the very end!!! Don't listen to anyone who tells you it isn't a great book.
0792165020|5.0|I haven't been a huge fan of Anthony Minghella until I checked The Talented Mr. Ripley out. It's simply superb! I love the way he's telling the story, sophisticated and profound. The changes he has made to the storyline just added another tragic yet sweet flavor to the movie. And the cast is GREAT! I never liked Matt Damon too much but his portray of the not-so-cold-blooded killer Tom Ripley is convincing, although sometimes I do wonder maybe Jude Law could do an even better job playing this character. But surely there's nobody who could be a better Dickie than Jude Law, spoiled, self-centered yet lovable, he is as gorgeous as always. Cate Blanchett has been my favorite actress since the first time I saw her in Elizabeth. Although Meredith is a minor role in it, she's done a wonderful job by playing this naive and somehow superficial girl. I always enjoy Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. This rich  Freddie keeps annoying me but I guess that's why he is a fine actor. And attributed to the excellent performance of British actor Jack Davenport, Peter Smith-Kingsley has become my favorite character in the whole movie. Gentle, caring and beautiful as he is, I couldn't help feeling heart-broken when the story ends *SIGH*
6305718954|5.0|I had never heard of this film yet someone mentioned it in passing as something that may interest me.  I have to say it do more than that.  The performances are absolutely brilliant.  The theme makes you really think.  I loaned this dvd out to three different people and all were amazed at what a good movie it is.  I highly recommend it.
068983571X|4.0|I found this book to be a very good work of litureature.  It keeps the reader guessing and was always having unexpected twists and turns.  I had read a few other Sherlock Holmes books and I have to say that this was my favorite.<br />The plot was extreamly intracate and the characters were rich and dramatic.  It was fun to see the characters progress and watch them face unknown odds.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Let me give you a minimal history to get you an idea, I bought this CD back when I was 13 and naive and susceptible to going along with the masses what with limpbizkit (however they spell their own name now anyway) being played everywhere, music videos in particular.  Saturated with it in fact.  You can't help but get caught along in the &quot;moment&quot;.<BR>Being a bit caught up in the &quot;moment&quot;, I ended up getting the CD as this is not the usual kind of music I akin myself to listening to.  I didn't even have to listen to all of the album, in fact the first few to know that this isn't really music.  It's not lyrically adept, it's not melodically clever, and definitely has no overall point.  THey're not making a statement on anything other than being famous during that time, 1999 or whenever it was.  Sure they're angry, they wanna use chainsaws (the most memorable thing from their album, well as memorable as it possibly can be)...but this is neither rap, nor metal, nor rock.<BR>It's just a bunch of what can I say CRAP, and I mean it.  CRAP put together to make money without thought or emotion.  I'm ashamed for keeping the CD and will proceed to either break it or throw it away.  A waste of money, unless you are a true true fan of limpbizkit and would die for them.  I don't think I remember anything from any of their songs, and it's foolish to claim it as anything &quot;good or brilliant&quot;.  It can only be barely tolerable while drunk or unconscious, it deserves not negative stars.  I don't think stars can describe it, I can think of worse albums, but it's pretty digusting.  Let's utilize how much it makes people want to vomit, I'd say highly likely, in fact very likely.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I have to agree with some others that this album takes some repeated listening to get into.  This music of dark and low tones.  It is not frivolous music either.  The musicianship is superb and the singing draws you in.  Some will ask why many go in for this kind of music.  As one person put it to me, why do they like \\"ugly\\" music?  By \\"ugly\\" he meant \\"dark\\" and \\"serious\\".  The answer is that there are many of a certain cast of mind that find \\"positive\\" and \\"happy\\" music is a mockery of life as they have found it.  Not all \\"happy/positive\\" music but much of it.  And we're not talking about the \\"life sucks\\" crowd either.<br />For people who have come out of the other end of great pain and troubles, any art that does not at least have a tint of sadness, regret and loss is false art.  For a lot of folk, Thirteenth Step is more real and life affirming than all \\"good time Charlie\\" bands and the hip grinding diva wanabes put together.<br />Maybe this album won't be heard by a lot; but I bet it will be very influential in the coming years.
B000089RVX|2.0|Ladies and gentlemen, here's a review by one who has tried to force herself to like many many albums after hearing rave reviews and decided to give up and listen to obscurities from other countries (mostly anyway).  <br />What this album, underneath a few positivities is actually a large cliche made of course by the music industry, the band's (insert adjective) ambition, and some luck.  Think of the band's CD name: Fallen.  Now is that not the most overused, steretypical name of an album who claims a &quot;dark, creepy, gothic, depressing...etc&quot;, not only is that stereotypical, so is the album.  Yes I do own the album, I'm not just &quot;dissing&quot; for the sake of it.  I own the album, and the album booklet is your usual &quot; 'coz like we're depressed, so we gotta have black and blue and dark colors.&quot;  <br />When I first listened to the album, I thought...&quot;Hmmm...O.K, so everything sounds a lot alike except 'Bring Me to Life' but maybe it'll change after that.&quot;<br />Unfortunately it didn't, everything still sounded the same.  I tried to listen to it a few times to maybe get a new insight or opinion or mood, but nothing's changed.  They have variations on lyrics, tone, and melody (slightly)...but everything ends up being lumped up pretty similarly in style.  &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is likely inputed by some musical &quot;guests&quot; that know what the audience want, while the band was left to their own doings for the rest of the songs.  They do sound very similar, and what bothers me is they really do lack -any- emotion at all, any...if you can see beneath the oh-so-sad facade.  You'll realize there's actually nothing really, same style, and fabricated lyrics for the sake of going along with their pre-pondered image. You might want to pick up the single &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; if you enjoy that song, I have to admit to have enjoyed it but it gets old real quick, and if you can stand to listen to the whole album which stylisticallyis just ONE LONG SONG...then by all means.  But for something meaningful, definitely not.
B00009RDGA|4.0|I had seen this movie when I was a kid back in 1973. I remembered it as being good back then. I found the DVD for $9.99 and decided to give it a try. I was suprised that the film stills holds up and is still good. Many films become dated and are not as good as you remember them. This film is still excellent. I give it 4 1/2 stars **** Not quite 5 stars. Shot in Black and white, it gives you the feeling that you are in the midewest in 1935. It is a good movie, the acting is very good and I enjoyed watching it. It is a good buy for $9.99 and a good film for families. Tatum O'Neal is very good in her role. I recommend this film. It's still good. Just have to see how it is 10 years from now. Now I need to view &quot;Last Picture Show&quot; again and see if that is still viable.
0812550706|3.0|&quot;a masterpiece,&quot; &quot;the greatest book ever,&quot; &quot;a science fiction tour de force&quot;!!!<br />These are some of the catch phrases used by reviewers here.  I just have to say...get a grip!  Ender's Game is a decent adolescent, soft sci-fi book that has somehow garnered legendary status within our public school system (my wife is a teacher).  Yes it's an (extremely) easy read, yes it's entertaining, but it is not a masterpiece that can be uttered in the same breath with such fictional works as Dune, The Lord of the Rings, Hamlet, etc.<br />A little perspective is required when reviewing something you really like.  Step back and evaluate it with an honest eye before elevating it into the pantheon of pulp fiction legend.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Sex and the City Season 5 is excellent, all the seasons are! If you are a big Sex and the City fan like me you should Def. Buy all the seasons!

0156029065|5.0|Baudolino, the latest novel by Umberto Eco, is more than just a playful historical romance or an excuse to indulge in Thomist disputatio.  It is a true contemporary classic of literature, full of what makes fiction great: strong characterization, compelling plotline, exquisite narrative style (even in translation), and multiple layers of philosophical resonance.<br />The basic premise of the book has been reiterated enough times by other reviewers for me to be brief.  Baudolino, an Italian peasant from Lombardy, is adopted by the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa.  He rises to become a distinguished courtier in the emperor's service, mostly through his skill in deceit-he invents stories effortlessly, always in support of what he considers to be a good cause.  He attends the University of Paris-a major center of Medieval learning and Scholasticism-and finds himself entangled in Barbarossa's difficulties in Italy, a land which he understands better than the emperor himself does.<br />But the novel's main focus is on the search for the kingdom of Prester John-the legendary king of an eastern Christian kingdom.  Along with his student-friends at the University, Baudolino decides that Prester John should be found because, as rex et sacerdos (king and priest), John's approval of Frederick could help Frederick assert his authority over the temporal and spiritual realms, giving him a final edge over the Pope.<br />This first section of the novel is historical, political, and fairly realistic.  Not to say it is inferior to what follows, but I got the distinct impression that Baudolino keeps improving as it goes on.  When Baudolino and his friends actually set out to find Prester John's kingdom, the story takes a fantastical turn-the group runs into a river of flowing rock, skiapods (men with one leg), forests of complete darkness, and many other wonders.  What is so unusual about this fantasy is that it is so strongly Medieval: most of these creatures are actually described in ancient texts.  <br />Besides this uniquely Medieval feel, what stands out most in this book (perhaps most of all) is the masterful characterization of Baudolino himself.  He is a real, decent man, neither saintly nor corrupt, and profoundly ambivalent when it comes to truth and falsity: since he narrates nearly all the book (even when Eco uses the third person, we understand that Baudolino is still, in some sense, the narrator), we never know what to trust in his narration.  But this is not just an old \\"unreliable narrator\\" technique; Baudolino himself comments on the nature of history, and how falsehood is sometimes useful in order to make events more interesting and useful.  The layers of comment on this topic are multifaceted, yet they fit with ease into the novelistic structure.<br />A word of comment on a criticism often leveled at this book, and Eco in general: the Scholastic debating contained in this book is neither boring nor overwhelming.  At least, I never found it to be so in the least.  If a reader has no interest in philosophy whatsoever, or loses patience with anything less plot-centric than Grisham or King, I concede that he may become bogged down in Eco's erudition.  But the average reader who can appreciate literature for more than just entertainment will not be disappointed or bewildered here; Eco doesn't flaunt his genius, but rather allows it to serve his fictional structure.  I am not an expert on Thomist debate or the intricacies of early church heresies, but I found almost nothing confusing in this book.  With its rich characterization, philosophical inquiry, and beautiful prose elegantly translated by the doyen of contemporary Italian-Lit translators, William Weaver, this fantastic novel is not to be missed.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Steal This Album by SOAD is just amazing. I got hooked on SOAD by first listening to 'Chop Suey!', and I got Toxicity and was blown away, and so I was glad that I got STEAL THIS ALBUM for my 19th birthday, and I loved it from the first track. This album is nothing short of amazing. A lot of the songs are good on here, some of my favorite are A.D.D.: America's Dream Denied, Innervision, and the rest of the album rules. This is a good and different album from my flock of music, but it is good either to just chill too or mosh too.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This album is in-your-face metal!  Dimebag Darrell smokes on the guitar.  His solos are ferocious, yet they have some melodic restraint.  Anselmo even does some singing instead of screaming only.  Strong songs include Cemetary Gates, Shattered, Message in Blood, and The Sleep.  Vulgar Display of Power is also awesome.  Never cared for anything after that.  Buy this album, it is worth having.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk To Remember by Nicholas Sparks was my first Nicholas Sparks novel, and was NOT MY LAST! I found this book to be very heartwarming, and very good. The story follows around Ben, now a middle-aged old man remembering the time back in the late 50's and how he fell in love with Jamie; a preachers daughter, and new to the town. Now Jamie is quiet, and keeps to herself, she is plain, but also she is a very beautiful person inside. At first Ben is assigned to do a scene with her for a school play, and they get to know each other, and they fall in love. <BR> As you get deeper into the book, they start to fall in love with each other deeper, and the book is just nothing short of amazing. Nicholas Sparks delivers how Ben just a normal boy and how Jamie changed Ben's life forever. I am not going to tell you the end, but it is very sad but it also delivers a message that love can come at whatever age, and still that person can still be there if he/she is gone forever, or just someone that moved away from you forever.
0375703764|2.0|When I listened to Poe's CD \\"Haunted\\" I heard this talk about a book her brother had written called \\"House of Leaves\\" and that if I \\"reeeally\\" wanted to get the concept of the CD, my best bet was to read the book. From that moment up until I finally bought the book (I found a first edition autographed for $70 and some odd cents on e-bay), I figured it would be worth the time and money.<br /> I couldn't have been more wrong than Donny Osmond at a strip club. <BR> <BR> Needless to say, this book was very overrated and boring. This book reminds me of the quiet so-called \\"artsy\\" student in the back of your literature class, and said complex sentences with large words just so they could make themselves feel like they made a point that didn't even exist.  The book itself is choppy and second rate as far as writing elemens go. Am I saying that it is complete trash? No. I might have taken the book out of context. Hell, I might not have  even read the book the way it should have been read. Zampano's literature and Johnny Truant's footnotes, autobiography, and sexual escapades just don't belong in the same \\"novel\\". And since Mr. Danielewski himself couldn't stay on task, I (and apparently others who read this book) felt as though this was a complete waste of time and money. Reading Zampano's story then immediately cutting to Johnny Truant's passages made it hard for me to answer questions like, \\"who did what?\\", \\"who said what?\\", and \\"does this have ANY signifigance to what happens later on in the story?\\" . I can't even figure out why this book was so popular. I'm not going to recommend this book to anyone because I'm not sure WHO I should recommend it to.
B00000DRXM|5.0|this album and the diary of a madman are the best cds oozy ever recorded, period. if it wasn't for randy rhaods, i won't even consider buying this album. randy rhoad along with evh are the best metal guitarist of the 80's. if you want to listen to some great guitar riffs and solos you won't be dissappointed, with classics such as crazy train and i don't know
B00005B36H|5.0|This became my favorite album of all time. I couldnt stop listening to it for a year straight. I wasnt even a Tool fan before I bought it, but of course I am now. Many people dont dig this album but to them I say that appreciating this album is like appreciating the forest when you are alone, you must slow yourself down and have no expectations about what you are going to experience. It is not at the pace of modern life, which can make it seem slow and dull and drawn out if you are not ready for it. But when you are ready it is the most relaxing and empowering metal music ever. Its not always necessarily heavy, even when it sounds like it should be. The thing is that it is good MUSIC. Some of it you could almost consider to have a classical feel, just with modern rock instruments and a metal style of playing. And you can't deny that Maynard has the best voice in rock music. I dare you to try and sing along. If you can you should be singing in a band making millions yourself!
0345350499|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. It is the retelling of the tale of King Arthur, from the viewpoint of his half-sister, who is not the villin that others would have us think. I finished it in a few days, I just couldn't put it down!! As a pagan, I appreciated the Goddess-oriented telling of the tale. The imagary was fantastic, and the discriptions of the rituals was entertaining. Having said that, one must keep in mind that this *is* fiction, and not to be taken as being historically accurate. Read the book, you'll like it. I should also mention that I have seen and own the movie. It doesn't follow the book exactly, but I enjoyed it as well!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This album is not as immediately likeable as its predecessors.  Sarah still sounds terrific, nobody can carry notes like she can, but there is nothing on this album to make you sit up straight right away and say &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />Even though it's a short album, I had difficulty differentiating some of the songs on the first few listening sessions.  &quot;Fallen&quot; of course is the best song on the album, but after repeated listening the rest sound better and better.<br />This is an album that has to grow on you, but when it does it sticks in your cd player.
0792844793|5.0|Although I was once inclined to agree with Roger Ebert's dismissal of \\"Blue Velvet\\" as a shocking albeit skillful montage of pointless images and effects, I've had to do a 360 turnaround after seeing it on DVD and reconsidering it in relation to some similar texts.  The film certainly makes sense in comparison with a quest narrative such as Hawthorne's \\"Young Goodman Brown\\" and in light of Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self.  It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Psycho,\\" in its preoccupation with spectator psychology.<br />The most important lines occur early in the film when the protagonist, Kyle MacLachlan, tells Laura Dern that he needs to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Isabella Rosselli because \\"knowledge requires risk\\" but with the possible reward that \\"you might learn something.\\" By the end of the narrative, MacLachlan's character should have learned a lot, but here's where Lynch flinches, much like Robert Altman in the conclusion to \\"The Player.\\" MacLachlan emerges neither a sadder nor wiser man from his rite of passage and his descent into the dark corners of the psyche. Instead, Lynch cynically reprises the film's innocent opening with its hopelessly artificial, Pollyannish, pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer.  At the same time, he preserves the tenuousness of such a naive vision with the shot of an insect impaled on a robin's beak and with a soundtrack that subjects the theme song to a disturbing treatment out of some internal, subterranean sound studio.<br />The film's meanings are inexhaustible, though a few important details should not be missed.  Jeff confronts, first, mortality (his father stricken by a life-threatening stroke), then a severed, decaying human ear. The ear, the organ of hearing, is also the sense that fully awakens only in the dark, granting access to the Dionysian, deep intuitive wellsprings of the self. But the ear we see on screen has become a diseased, useless instrument in a \\"sunny\\" culture whose idea of music is Bobby Vinton's version of \\"Blue Velvet.\\" Rossellini's alternative version of the song, with all of its sensuous, alluring darkness, will draw MacLachlan in to the same degree that it repells girl friend Dern (contrast this relationship with that of Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in \\"Rear Window,\\" where Kelly becomes increasingly drawn to the voyeuristic and \\"ghoulish\\" activity initiated by Stewart). Soon MacLaclan will discover the love substitutes embodied by both Rossellini and Hopper--the sadism and masochism, fetishism and scopophilia that, like it or not, are present in every son and daughter who has inherited from birth and learned from upbringing the pleasure/pain principle that underlies even the most well-intentioned, \\"selfless\\" love (the absence of any shown feelings between MacLaclan and either parent is another tip-off to the basis of his attraction to the dominitrix/sex slave character played by Rossellini).<br />As for the \\"villain,\\" the foul-mouthed Dennis Hopper did not seem so frightening or repelling to me on this viewing.  If anything, he's less the personification of evil than another version of insecure, overcompensating macho desire, perhaps better seen as a projection of the searching MacLachlan than as anybody's nemesis.<br />Lynch must know the risk, and even believe in the necessity, of coming to terms with the feelings of a darker but far from inauthentic self.  MacLaclan tells the naive, shielded and conventional Dern from the beginning that it's extremely dangerous business. But the alternative is a Salem where everybody is \\"good,\\" a Lumberton where people get sick but never die, a Disney fantasy that can exist only in artificial movies.  I still think that \\"Blue Velvet\\" (in fact, most any other film since 1980) is eclipsed by his own \\"Elephant Man,\\" where the camera takes us into the eye-hole and interior world of John Merrick, whose world we discover is also ours.  But \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a more personal film, revealing not simply the mind of its creator but capturing a distinctively American experience.akes us into the eye-hole and interior world of John Merrick, whose world we discover is also ours.

B00005JMTN|5.0|I just got back from seeing 'Big Fish'. It was the most spectacular and touching film I have seen. Tim Burton really made something beautiful when he directed it. The film is so entertaining you just fall in love with all of the characters, and the end will leave you in tears. I felt that I really knew Edward, and was sad when his story ended. Ewan McGregor was enchanting in this film. I absolutely adored this film, and I hope that you all will go and see it's charm for yourself.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The comparisons of THE MATRIX to STAR WARS are now I'm sure as legendary as the movie itself. Yet it cannot be said enough for a powerful reason.<br />There is a new paradigm of thought in town, bringing us in to the 21st century with unprecedented power, grace and style. In psychology in the earlier part of the 20th century, Jung the spiritualist/linguist so upset the applecart of Freud the biologist that it ushered in a whole new way to see humanity--respecting and, via inclusion, transcending the ones that came before it in its new perspective. But Stanislov Grof, with his post-Quantum, scientific mysticism, jumped so far beyond Jung that he makes him look like early Freud in comparison, and as such prepares us for both the ancient past and the 21st century.<br />Equally and similarly, before the seventies, one can see the plethora of movies influenced by the Freudian perspective on human life and Western Culture (think Hitchcock), and their often amazing quality and insight. George Lucas, however, building on that Jazz mystic Stanley Kubrick, decided to come along and do an Ali (\\"I'll shake up the World!!!!!!\\") and give us a Jungian masterpiece underneath innovative special effects, changing movie making forever. There was really almost nowhere new to go in science fiction or action movies in their entirety after STAR WARS...until the Wachowski Brothers, like Grof to Jung, showed us directly what Lucas hinted at cryptically: INNER Space is the only space.<br />STAR WARS, after the several years we needed to catch on, allegorically introduced the greater world to the symphonic poetry of the Post-Jungian Mythographer and genius Joseph Campbell. THE MATRIX trilogy reintroduces us to the myth and mysticism that still forms the foundation of our culture and consciousness, as Joseph Campbell said, but in the context of *Michael Talbott* (see the book, THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE): the quantum leap above and beyond Jung and Campbell for our post-modern, post-Einstein time. And it does so in a way that will be the standard for all myth-making and story-telling in Hollywood for quite some time, I'm sure. Yet like all great movies, knowing why it is so great doesn't stop you from enjoying it. Neither does seeing it a bunch of times! There is something new to mine from this trilogy every time you see it--particularly this one--because of the divine truths it thematically and metaphorically underscores.<br />Naturally, you can't ignore the obvious: the special effects and cinematography are from another planet. The fight choreography in RELOADED is the closest thing to ballet since CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (and by the same fight choreographer). Laurence Fishburne is again, well, Laurence Fishburne (any OTHELLO fans out there, with Kenneth Branaugh as Iago?). And, saints be praised, Keanu has not only found the role he was meant to play (unlike so many others), he really earns a nomination with this performance. But, like the first MATRIX, the trick is that all of the above could have sucked with a script as powerful as this one and the movie would have still been wonderful. The script actually brings to life all of the above mentioned spiritual themes by vehicularizing a rumination on the existence of choice and free will for the purpose of bringing some of the most profound Eastern philosophy and Hindu myth to our consciousness as the plotline/framework of this movie.  And they do so in not just a brilliantly entertaining way, but in a way that even a young teenager (like my son) could click on to, but not even a brain surgeon (like Pribram?) or an astrophysicist (like Bohm?) could ignore. This is real reason why you can watch both--in fact all three--of these movies 16 times each and still see it again as if it was the first each time.  And you may need to watch it at least twice to get half of the treasure trove of ideas flowing through it like fish in the river Nile.<br />Own this. This and *PI*--another wonderful independent film that heralds the discovery of the secret worlds of INNER space--are the New Testament of Science Fiction for me; maybe for all movie making for this new century.nt film that heralds the discovery of the secret worlds of INNER space--are the New Testament of Science Fiction for me; maybe for all movie making for this new century.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|\\"Concert for George\\" (2003) deserves an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. It's a beautiful work that should be seen by anyone who appreciates popular music. The spiritual artistry of the late George Harrison leaps from the screen in this moving tribute concert at the Royal Albert Hall - captured for posterity by director David Leland and cinematographer Chris Menges. The highlights are plentiful: heartfelt performances by Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Billy Preston and the underrated Sam Brown; the Monty Python reunion; Anoushka Shankar's stunning orchestration of \\"Arpan\\"; and Joe Brown's touching farewell, \\"I'll See You in My Dreams.\\" In all, a transcendent celebration of Harrison's life and music.
0782006809|5.0|I don't know if I have ever seen a movie with Doris Day in it that I didn't like and this is no exception.  Doris plays an out of work, girl next door, character, Cary Grant, a millionaire, Gig Young works for Cary and Audrey Meadows is her room-mate and friend.  Because the car that Cary was riding in accidently splashes water on Doris, Cary sends Gig to apologize and then when Gig sees her reaction he thinks that finally here is a girl that will put his boss in his place and encourages her to go tell Cary how she feels.  It backfires, and Doris falls for Cary, but being a modest moral female, when he proposes that she come with him on a trip that doesn't include marriage, she has misgivings.  She decides to go finally, but then develops a rash at the thought of doing the immoral act and then it keeps getting funnier.  Gig Young and Audrey Meadows are really great in the movie also.  I recommend the movie.  Enjoy!
B000068OSK|5.0|The new stuff may be on the radio, but this album captures the soul of the White Stripes. Dirty, loud, gritty, bluesy and painful, this is the best place to start.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Although the film is a bit predictable at times and Leo's Irish accent is not altogether believable, when taken as a whole, this film is quite impressive.   Particularly entertaining is Daniel Day Lewis as &quot;Bill the Butcher.&quot;  Blending outright savagery with a sardonic, dark wit, his character, who couldn't be more politically incorrect reminds us that, while we still have a long way to go with race relations in America, we have also come a long way since the 1860s.  His performance alone is worth the purchase price of the DVD, but the DVD also has a number of very nice special features.  Unfortunately, as with many of the recent epics (e.g., extended editions of Lord of the Rings, Oliver Stone releases) the length of the film necessitates that the movie be split into two discs, but I guess two discs is still better than two VHS tapes.<br />On a deeper level, the film blends thousands of subtle historical minutiae into a rich tapestry that not only grounds the characters into a specific point in American history, but it also gives the viewer a sense of what life in the Five Points might have been like about as well as any three and a half hour film could hope to do.  Despite its flaws and its significant length, this film is well worth the time, particularly for those who like historical drama.
0688163173|5.0|If you don't have an afternoon free, don't bother opening this book. Lehane's latest novel will hook you in and won't let you go until you turn the last page. His sharp style kept me on the edge of my seat for the better part of a weekend. He blew me away with twists and turns that will knock your socks off! You could just feel the pain and suffering of our &quot;hero&quot; Teddy as he attempts to unravel the mystery the surrounds Shutter Island. The only problem for Teddy is that every time he solves one piece of the puzzle, Lehane takes him (and you the reader) down another dark path of danger and intrigue.
B000001ESP|5.0|It's instructive to know that Moving Pictures is Rush's largest-selling album, and has produced the most familiar radio hits, with Permanent Waves being a close second. Therefore, both of these albums are a no-brainer for any Rush fan's collection.<br />However, if you are new to Rush, Moving Pictures is not necessarily the first album I would recommend.  Instead, I suggest starting off your musical journey with albums whose music is closest to your own preferences. Here are some rough suggestions:<br />Hard Rock - Fly By Night, 2112<br />Progressive Rock - A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres<br />Techno/New Wave - Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows<br />Grunge - Counterparts<br />Alternative - Vapor Trails.<br />After that, you should move chronologically through their entire catalog (includig all live albums), starting with their first album.  Following this procedure should get you hooked on Rush's music more quickly.  Moreover, it will give you a much better perspective of and appreciation for the true breadth and enormity of Rush's music.<br />Happy listening!
1565847032|5.0|This here is the perfect book for those who have yet to read chomsky's in depth work, or those who simply find Chomsky's ideas very interesting, yet find his work tedious.  This book consists of nearly every political subject thinkable.  He talks abour foriegn policy in the middle east, latin america, what was done in europe after ww2.  He speaks of anarchism, socialism, marxism, and leninism.  He speaks on the media, and &quot;free trade&quot;.  He discusses everything of political relevance.  If you don't care for reading his other work because you find it too mind boggling or tedious, then i suggest this.  Its all interviews, and its real straightforward.
B00003CWTI|3.0|I had very high expectations for this film, based on PT Andersons previous work.  I had just viewed the similarly fast-paced &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, and perhaps this excellent film set me up for dissapointment.  Somehow this film slipped under my radar in 1999, so I did a little research. Most Box Office sites report this film cost $37 million to produce, yet yielded only $40 million in box office receipts. This is not a good sign to begin with, but I don't judge a film by box office numbers, look up the work of David Lynch.<br />The main problem I had with PT's script is the ridiculous use of profanity, more specifically the use of the &quot;F&quot; word.  Profanity has an important part in cinema, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is a perfect example. However, the use of profanity in this film is forced, unnatural, unbelievable, unnnecessary, and unnrealistic.  When Julianne Moore goes to the family attorney and states the following hysterically, &quot;I have f**ked other men, I have sucked their c**ks!&quot;, I could not help but think that PT was trying too hard to shock the audience. It was as though the harder I tried to care about the character and become drawn into the story, PT would write in a ridiculous line as previously mentioned. A lady of prominence and wealth such as the Moore character may have told her family attorney, &quot;I have been unfaithful to my husband&quot;, that would have been much more believable.<br />The Tom Cruise character was also over the top. Forget about the content of his &quot;self-help&quot; seminar, the interview with the television reporter was also a stretch. Cruise strips down to his bikini briefs in front of a television reporter WHO HE JUST MET, with TV cameras present. I don't think so. I understand PT is trying to show that Cruise's character is an animal both in front of the crowd and backstage, but he picked a ridiculous way to show it.<br />***Warning Spoiler*** Finally, the frogs. Tiny toads, maybe. Look itup on the net. But huge, long legged frogs, don't think so.<br />Which is really sad. There are superstars of the cinema in this film, and the fast-paced cutting and drama build-up could have led to a great film. It turned out being a fair movie with some intense moments, but the freak of nature incident used to tie all of the characters together was ridiculous. Some other plot ploy would have made this movie much better. When the frogs began to fall I can see people getting up and leaving the theater. Some may have not waited that long, instead leaving when Cruise stripped down to his briefs.
B00005YTFG|5.0|At first a little feisty and hard to follow, it blossoms into the most beautiful duets and songs inspired by music and love songs originally written by modern artists.  &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; &quot;Love is like oxygen,&quot; &quot;In the Name of Love&quot; and &quot;This is Your Song;&quot; Nicole and Ewan turn that musical artistry into a feast for the eyes, ears and even the soul. Some lines in the movie are so precise and poingnant that they can only be sung to convey the full meaning the movie seeks to project:  That above all else this is a story about love. If you are a romantic, the movie will touch you.  You will not see this movie only once.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|So Britney can't sing. Neither can Mick Jagger, Madonna, or Janet Jackson. But they have had lasting careers and making great music at the same time. Now I love Madge and Janet but really when we listen to their records were not looking for some grand statement we just want hot beats, great melodies and cool dance moves. Which is what Brit delivers. &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; and &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; are what we expect from Brit. Beats count more than vocals when you really can't sing. &quot;Boom Boom&quot; is a wreck of a song! She should distance herself from rappers. Not a good combination. &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; is waaaayyyyy to busy and overblown of a song. Not a good first single. And Jessica Simpson should have been given the song &quot;Everytime&quot;! Britney should keep to fast songs. She hasn't had a hit single in a while. Certainly nothing in the top 20. &quot;Not a Girl....'&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot; were not huge hits and I doubt &quot;Everytime&quot; will be either when it is inevitably released as a single. &quot;Toxic&quot; gets annoying real fast. &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; is catchy and what a cool play on words! Think of what a cool box set that her record company will release one day. Apparently she worked with BT on her last cd and nothing was released and she worked with Fred Durst on this cd. Again nothing released from that collaboration. Definitley buy this cd, but keep your expectations low and remeber, she's not really a singer but a personality!
B0000B3FCX|1.0|Nickelback has to be one of the worst bands of today. No, I'm not talking about talent, they can obviously play repetitive annoying 3-chord riffs over and over till you feel like committing suicide. If you plan on killing yourself for listening to this corporate garbage, barring that you don't go deaf first, I don't blame you. There is no melodic value to this whatsoever. It is sad that Nickelback is a success in the music industry along with other weak bands like Saliva (Josie Scott is the ugliest elephant I've ever seen). They're both pseudo-country. No wonder why the only people who like these bands seem to be the ones who are looking to &quot;rebel&quot; their parents' preferred tastes of country. Go get 'em cowboy...yee haw. I think Earnhardt Jr. is waiting outside.
B0000CAQ27|3.0|I wasn't a fan of Pinks first album. It sounded too much like Destiny's Child and the rest of the girl groups of that time period. I wasn't much interested in &quot;Mizundastood&quot; when it came out either, until I read the reviews of how brilliant it was. And it was. I couldn't stop listening to it and looked forward to this album finally coming out. But I was a little disappointed. &quot;Trouble&quot; is a fabulous song and the acoustic version on AOL Sessions kicks ass. Pink can sing! &quot;God is a DJ&quot; is just as good as anything on the 2nd album, if not better. What disappoints me is that the Linda Perry songs aren't that great. &quot;Catch me While I'm Sleeping&quot; seems so out of place, and &quot;Waiting for Love&quot; goes nowhere. &quot;Try to Hard&quot; is an improvement. &quot;Hooker&quot; the added song at the end rocks out hard and the lyrics are biting. And it's questionable about just who this song is about! Repeated listens will reveal that this is a worthwhile buy, but maybe a little too long. A couple songs could have been chopped off and this album could have gotten 5 stars from me! Not that Pink cares! Do you think these artists are resentful of their fans when they read negative things on sites like this?

How long did it take television and movies to get this right?  Ye gods.  In \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\", the crew has to shoot down a trap in space but with a normal rifle.  Because the slug is still propelled with fire, you need oxygen.  Solution: shoot the rifle from inside a spacesuit.<br />My wife loathes SciFi and she always takes the time to make fun of my interests and yet, she loves Firefly.<br />If you even thinking or not thinking about getting this DVD set, do not dismiss the 450+ positive reviews.  Just save the money, get the set and keep the Kleenex handy because you will cry when you realize that this great show is no more.<br />I am thinking if I get The Family Guy (owned), Firefly (owned), Sports Night (owned), The Shield (want) and The Wire (want) do I really need to watch television ever again?<br />Edit: I notice that some people reference Dark Angel, Buffy and Angel as shows that lead them to Firefly.  I am the complete opposite: I know that Buffy and Angel sucked and I couldnot get over the horrid writing of Dark Angel.  It just goes to show that Firefly fits one genre: greatness.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I was lucky to &quot;discover&quot; Ms Krall early in her career.  I was impressed with her voice and with her band.  Each of her recordings have been a little more polished than the previous release, sometimes making them slightly bland.  &quot;Live In Paris&quot; is, however, Diana Krall at her best.  The band is tight and the arrangements are superb.  Her voice is at its peak and the recording is detailed.  Her rendering of Joni Mitchell's &quot;Case of You&quot; sticks in my mind as a truly magic moment.  My only complaint is that the final song, &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; should not be here.  It's not that the song or the recording or the performance is bad.  It's actually rather good.  It's something of a bonus track on a recording that doesn't need any bonuses.  It was obviously recorded in an atmosphere totally different from the live songs and it doesn't belong.  Program the CD to end with &quot;Case of You&quot; and you will enjoy the performance much more.  Come back to &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; another time.
0385504209|4.0|I just finished a furious 2 days reading this book.  The pace of this book sure isn't slow.  It did remind me somewhat of a movie - but that wasn't a bad thing.  The one thing about this book is that the story left me with questions - good questions - about our world, our religions, and symbols.<br />Read over some of the other reviews of this, here and elsewhere.  You can tell by some of the reviewers comments that they take personal offense to this book and the topic discussed.  I have seen several websites that set out to &quot;debunk&quot; this book, which is quite humorous to me.  It is kind of like those rabid Star Trek fans who try to find flaws in the episodes.  (psst - it is fiction)<br />Dan Brown writes an enticing, interesting story.  Of course there are others out there that cover this topic, but Dan Brown does a very good job of introducing the ideas to a public that may not know about it.  Do the ideas presented here hold water outside the covers of this book?  After reading it, I want to find out how much of it is fiction, how much is fact, and how much is somewhere in-between.  To me, that is the mark of a good book.  Just like a movie, I don't think all the questions should be answered within the beginning and ending pages.<br />Just like religion, you shouldn't let other people make your decisions for you.  Read the book, and make up your own mind.
0156027321|5.0|I loved the book and savoured it. But why in hell did the US editor cut out one of the central sentences in the end? <BR>[SPOILER, don't read if you still want to read the book!!]<BR>In the end, Pi asks: Which story do you like better? And when the man answers &quot;The one with the tiger&quot;, he states &quot;And so it goes [or &quot;is&quot;, can't exactly remember] with God.&quot;<BR>This sentence was left out in all US copies I got after a friend told me so. I couldn't believe it. It is in the UK and in the Canada edition, though. Is that true for all copies, or did I just find stupid ones?<BR>For all the rest, an amazing story, and for all unbelieveability, it is written so well you might think it is a true story - regarding, the contents, hard to believe.
0375751513|5.0|&quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is a classic novel suffused with intriguing philosophies along with discrete ethical lessons. Oscar Wilde incorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture. The storyline is dynamic and captivating while the words play smooth and melodious. &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is thought-provoking and certain to interest a variety of readers. I would recommend this book to anyone.
1881273156|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible. Having serious marital problems, I was desperate for any kind of help. I was about to turn to counseling when I heard about this book. I decided to buy it so that my husband and I could read it together.<br />Not expecting too much, one lazy morning I suggested to my husband that we lay in bed and begin reading this book out loud to eachother. We read 120 pages that morning! We could not put it down! Both of us shed a lot of tears that morning, this book really hit home.<br />That morning when we woke up, everything seemed hopeless for us. After reading this book, we had hope that our problems can be resolved. Our attitude toward eachother has greatly changed since we read this book.<br />Basically this book explains that people feel loved in different ways. For example, my love language is \\"quality time\\" and my husband's love language is \\"personal touch.\\" Without quality time with my husband, I feel unloved... my husband feels unloved when we have a lack of physical contact. Our love languages are so different... before reading this book, I just thought that my husband wanted more sex for selfish reasons. When in reality, personal contact is what he needs to feel loved. Before reading this book, my husband hated when I nagged about spending time together.. but now he realizes that spending time with me is the best way to tell me that he loves me.<br />Dr. Chapman says in this book that LOVE IS A CHOICE. Find your partner's love language style, then choose to show love to your partner in that way (it's not about what YOU need to feel loved, it's about what YOUR PARTNER needs). I thought that spending quality time with my spouse was the way I can show him I love him. In reality, that's MY love language, not HIS.<br />Even if your partner does not want to read this book with you, there are ways you can begin to repair your marriage on your own, and before you know it, your partner will begin to reciprocate.<br />This book is INCREDIBLE. I plan to pass it around my friends and family. Please invest the $12 and read this book, your marriage will never be the same again!
B000008DKG|5.0|Supremely original and uncategorizable pop music from this artistic Glasgow, Scotland trio. At first impression this beautifully produced 20-year-old but ageless debut's sound is more ambient, atmospheric, textured and stark than their excellent followup \\"Hats.\\" Repeated listenings brings to the fore the passion of Paul Buchanan's soulful and unforgettable singing and the tactile,poetic, consistently moving and urban-detailed lyrics. (Glasgow, its buildings, streets and people, seems to be an almost spiritual influence.) A residing sense of authenticity and yearning and loneliness throughout the record and on songs like \\"Easter Parade,\\" \\"Tinstletown in the Rain,\\" \\"Stay\\" are unforgettable. Wonderful, timeless music.

B000053V7Q|5.0|This DVD of Elvis's times in Vegas is unbelievable. I am in awe when I watch it. So much better than the VHS version obviously because of the picture and 5.1 sound. On my bigscreen and home theatre system, it's almost as if I am there in concert. This is a must have for any Elvis fan. What is good about this DVD is that it is all rehersal and concert. Gone is the fan and other footage from the original.
0385504209|1.0|The book is mildly entertaining, but readers beware of the gross historical inaccuracies littered throughout the book.

B00005B4GU|1.0|I just don't get this album or why so many seem to think this album is so great. It's a muddled, boring, at times annoying collection of mediocre attempts at pop/rock/post wave avant garde. The emp' has no clothes. Want to hear a good, weird, interesting album, pick up Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica instead.
0671510991|5.0|&quot;Diplomacy&quot; is a very interesting book, that should be read by all those who are interested in either International Relations, History, or even merely in good books.<br />It covers the period that goes from the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, to the early 1990's. Somehow, this books manages to give us a very good idea of what happened in that time span, without boring us to death at the same time, and that is not a small merit.<br />&quot;Diplomacy&quot; was written from the point of view of Henry Kissinger, a controversial man who was secretary of State of USA. Whatever might be said about him, something cannot be dennied: he knows his craft. And in &quot;Diplomacy&quot; he makes that evident, exactly as he had done previously in other books, for example in &quot;The World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the Problems of Peace&quot;.<br />His prose is quite elegant, but at the same time easy to read. Kissinger mixtures historical facts with his personal opinions, dissecting what happened and trying to draw conclusions that allow the reader to discern long term trends in history, thus enabling him/her to really understand what happened.<br />I bought this book a long time ago, but I still consider it a keeper. It isn't exhaustive, but it doesn't pretend to be so... On the whole, a book worth buying and having. Recommended :)
B000076CY6|2.0|I agree with everyone who says there are too many small pieces!  We have 2 of these sets-just to get enough bricks to build a house, fort, castle or whatever!  I'm now on the hunt for a set with larger bricks-like I had as a kid. I'm very disappointed with the sets that are out for this very reason!
B0000AMRJC|4.0|Al Pacino's Tony Montana is one of the most over the top, gritty characters in recent cinema.  He is one of the thousands of Cuban criminals Castro shipped to our shores in the early 80's and from the moment he steps off the boat, he is all about getting himself to the top, to have all the money and power he has heard about.  His version of the American dream.  Early in the film, he is working as a dishwasher in a local diner.  He tells his friend &quot;I didn't come to the United States to break my back&quot;.  Immediately after this, he is offered 5,000 dollars to make a drug pickup and quits the dishwashing job on the spot.  <br />This encounter leads him to drug kingpin Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) who takes Montana under his wing and shows him the ropes.  Lopez has a mistress, Elvira(Michelle Pfeiffer) who is just along for the drugs and money.  Pfeiffer's performance is a disappointment in the film.  She is simply there to wear revealing clothing and look stoned, which she does well.  After Lopez is killed, she takes up with and marries Montana, almost not caring who it is she is with, just so she gets her fix.<br />In the process of placing himself at the top of the drug world, Montana sees a blimp flashing the words &quot;The world is yours&quot; at him during the movie.  At the end, when he has achieved all he has blindly sought, this mantra is on a neon sign in his mansion.  The world he wanted was money and power and I was reminded of the line from Citizen Kane &quot;It's not hard to make a lot of money, if all you want to do is make a lot of money&quot;<br />As Montana, Pacino is hard core, loud, boastful, and proud.  He aligns himself with a Columbian drug lord at the beginning of his rise by promising loyalty.  He keeps his word with this man and is later asked to perform another task for him.  The result of this request leads to the film's end.  He goes out of his way to protect his kid sister from people like him, but in the end this strategy backfires on him as well.  His life is unhappy, desperate, and wanting.  Once he reached the top, there is a great scene showing him looking at his vast empire with a blank expression on his face.  He has it all, yet he has nothing.  In the end, happiness in life comes not from money or power or wealth, rather through the relationships one has in life.  Tony's life is totally devoid of such meaningful relationships, therefore he is one of the unhappiest men you will ever see.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Im Not big on live albums and I hardly ever heard Radiohead live also, but my friend who is a bigger Radiohead fan than I'am told me that this is a really great album, I got this cd for Christmas and well I find to a real great live cd from Radiohead.  They have picked some great songs on this album, I Might Be Wrong is best when it's live, *The Album verison is good as well*, National Anthem is great too,Morning Bell,Idioteque,etc all great But the one I'am most impress with is True Love Waits, I've heard it before I got this album when I made a mix cd with a bunch of B-sides and other stuff from Radiohead and I put TLW on there cause alot of people told me it was probably the best Radiohead song there is, and with it being on This album makes it a great live cd for Radiohead fans to have.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Just like the final movie in the phenomenal series, the final score for the third film feels like the last leg of a huge opera (which indeed was his goal). No it may not be as bold as The Fellowship of the Ring's score, but no good opus should rely on the same themes over and over. While there are few standout tracks, almost all of theme are solid, the exception being #18 The Gray Havens, which is too mellow to properly portray what you should be feeling, especially when the highs have subsided and has started to drag for people unfirmiliar with the book. And yes, the soundtrack isn't as entertaining if you don't know what's going on at the time, but as that was again Shore's and Jackson's intention--not to overpower the scenes.<br />Som of my favorite tracks:<BR>1 A Storm is Coming: Stronger strings playing the &quot;history of the rings&quot; Theme is Faaaan-tastic.<BR>2 Hope and Memory: lovely bit that proclaims the last leg of a great, great story is underway.<BR>3 Minas Tirith: The most grandios rendition of the Gondor Theme that (thankfully) doesn't disappiont (some renditions in the EE's of the first 2 films were underwhelming, had me a bit worried).<BR>6 Minas Morgul: Full fledged Mordor Theme baby! So good you can excuse the short track time.<BR>8 Twilight and Shadow: One last melancholy repraise of the beautiful (and I mean to the nth degree) Evenstar theme from The Two Towers.<BR>13 The Fields of Pelennor: Alas, the charge of the Rohirrim is missing and I would have liked for their to be more all around, but good stuff none the less.<BR>14,15,16: All mesh together really well, can feel the age-ending events taking place.<BR>19 Into the West: Is great when is quiet and sad, not so good when it tries to peak, but is worthy to be the last track on this series of excellent scores. And that's saying something. Some great lyrics too (especially if your obsessed with the novel). Give it a few listens and a little time; it'll grow on ya.<br />Extremely well done.As epic and sincere as the wonderful movies and books they're based on. Shore's willingness to spend and good chuck of his life working on this shows. Thank you Shore and all collaborators!
0446677450|4.0|This book is really great for the young investing mind. Specifically if you haven't already started bad habits you can really learn a lot from this book. Kiyosoki is very thick in his conclusions, meaning he takes a long while to reach his point. I would recommend this book to any young person or even mid-age investors. It will not give you specifics put it will begin to bring things together and put it all in perspective once and for all. Most people have high school and some form of formal education, that does not teach good money spending and investing ideals. This book just may do the trick for you and polish up those spots empty in a formally educated person.
0679735259|5.0|Michael Herr's &quot;Dispatches&quot; brings the Vietnam War down to its most basic level,the individual soldier and Marine, and should be on the reading list for everyone in Officer's Candidate School, and anyone who wants a real &quot;feel&quot; for what Vietnam was like. Dispatches is not military history, but it is a personal account of one person's year in Vietnam from the first days of bewilderment to the dreams that persisted once you returned home. When people ask me what was Vietnam like, I give them Dispatches to read and to add to their library. It covers, almost to the date, the 13 months I spent in Vietnam as a Marine, and, more than any book I've read, I consider it my story.

Her voice is ok; I really didn't like this album too much.  I did like &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; and a few other ones, but that was it.  I didn't what was so great about this album, but like I said, I really don't like jazz but I give any type of music a try; and this is not for me.

I own the first one and the second one i will own the last one when it comes out lord of the rings is a one of a kind movie how can u hate it. I am sorry to say i have never read the books but i loved the movies. The next movie they are coming out with is called the hobbit and it waz based before part 1. I have the hobbit  book and i will read it when i get a chance.This movie is so good and i loved it because all the work they put in to making this movie. I loved all of the amazon bonus cutseens and every thing about this movie. This is my all time favorite movie and i could go on for ever about it.

B0000C7GG2|5.0|This CD is amazing. Muse have more talent in their pinkies than most bands could ever wish to have. There is not a better intelligent rock band. Im a huge fan of Radiohead, DJ Shadow and rock like the deftones. But no one can rock out like these guys. How is it possible that these guys get better and better? They  keep taking it to new and better levels and it doesn't look like they'll stop anytime soon.  Buy it now.
0783114222|5.0|Extremely well done and with very good job balancing the dramatic and technical aspects.  Everything about this production is first rate. I've watched it several times and some segments a half a dozen or more.  Suitable for audiences interested in either the technical or non-technical aspects of the space race.<br />It was so well done that even its deficiencies can't reduce its overall impact: 1) the Apollo 13 segment was much less about that mission rather than the media circus around it (hint: watch the movie \\"Apollo 13\\" instead). 2) Von Braun's contributions only get passing mention; I would have liked to see more about the development of the Saturn Rockets.
0151008116|5.0|Sometimes books categorized as Others just fulfilled your craving for something new and relatively unheard of.

B0000BWVCM|4.0|It seems that Hollywood has difficulty producing sequels which are as entertaining as the first film.  Fortunately, the X-men Universe has substantial material for continuing stories for new films instead of a trite re-hash of the original movie.<br />This movie's action and special effects are better than the previous.  The moral ambiguities involving choices of the characters are a bit more complex.  Don't get me wrong, this movie does not require huge amounts of deep thought.  However, if you have the inclination, there is some room to ponder certain ethical quandries that underly the plot.<br />Very enjoyable for those who are fond of action films, and a clear cut above many of the comic-book adaptations.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This collection of songs is a real overwhealming christmas-present for all Tull-fans. I first was a little bit negative about this album, but after the third hearing I loved it and it ran all the chtistmas-time in my stereo. Even though I'm not a big fan of Instrumentals - the ones on this album are the best I've ever heared.<BR>Check out this album and you'll discover a real jewel especially for the christmas time and long december days.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is an absolutely brilliant portion of the greatest movie trilogy ever.  Aside from the dull performance of Elijah Wood, this movie has everything you could ask for.  Gollum is simply the greatest CGI character ever.  The interaction of Legolas and Gimli will leave you grinning from ear to ear.  And the battle for helms deep is breathtaking.  Just watch it already!
B000008H1U|5.0|This album is a real (grammy) winner. It is strange that it was very late in my &quot;career&quot; as a Tull-Fan that I discovered this album because: it is one of the best ones! The beautiful &quot;Budapest&quot; and &quot;Said she was a dancer&quot; are pieces of high quality. The whole album is more than worth a grammy! I promise: Just buy it and you'll become a Tull-Fan.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|They ruined the Matrix.  It no longer has that cool aura.  Beginning with this stinker, everything that made the original cool was ruined with the sequals.  Morpheus no longer means anything, Neo still is an idiot, and this movie blows.  Who cares about the special effects when the story just doesn't back it up.  Horrible.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I've got to conclude this is one of the best concert DVD's I have seen. It is technically and qualitatively impressive: both in sight and sound, and definitely moving. I have admired Eric Clapton's musicianship since Cream (1966)days: after this, I have come to RESPECT him as well. The extraordinary talent that was amassed for that evening hardly would ever be assembled again. I agree with other reviewers: give Macca some slack over purported ego issues. There is no point of being revisionist about George's evolution in the midst of having to work with two extremely talented giants which were the nucleus of the Beatles. George was ready, but had to have the group implode before making his talent obvious to us. I was impressed with the sonic quality of George's songs, delivered by others: Eric, Paul, et. al. even when you compare with Anthology 3, All Things Must Pass.. I mean George's voice (not his talent as a composer) began to falter in the early-mid 70's as a result of what eventually would have created his downfall: cigarette smoking. Beware of sadness: George, rest in peace and thanks for the memories. As for this DVD, don't miss out and do buy it ASAP.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|These days, it seems the music industry is focused more on \\"image\\" than music, and all the record companies seem to be in constant hissy-fits over P2P software like Kazaa. This makes something like Jet's debut album, \\"Get Born,\\" that much more appealing. It's refreshing to hear an album that is rock in its truest form, with songs that reach back to the roots of rock-classic greats like The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and The Who. Still, the members of Jet aren't afraid to be themselves, creating their own unique sense of style-a fact which really makes this album shine. Managing to stay interesting from start to finish, \\"Get Born\\" encompasses a diverse array of songs, from the catchy, fast-paced songs like \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\" and \\"Get Me Outta Here\\" to the slower, softer rock ballads such as \\"Look What You've Done\\" and \\"Move On.\\" The album transitions between these well and is well-rounded in its variety. The lyrics aren't always poetic or brilliant, but Jet manages to show the world that they are a band that has talent, style, and the ability to rock. Hopefully, \\"Get Born\\" only represents the birth of this amazing band's career, and we will see much more to come in the future.
0385504209|5.0|What a book!  And let me say, because of the length of the story, try the &quot;large print&quot;.  Makes your eyes a lot less tired.<br />My cousin told me about this book.  I had never heard of it.  I could not put it down.  The story is excellent and the truths that were told were something that just simply confirms my beliefs.<br />Anyone who insults this book down for its content, should reconsider.  Open your eyes to the possibilities as they exist. The Bible, some believe is the word of God.  However, others like I, believe that they are simply stories... made up.  They sound good, but come on.  And that Jesus is not the Son of God.  But instead a mere human.<br /> I had to go online and look for the Last Supper after I finished the book.  I found it, and WOW.<br />Thanks Dan Brown.
0385512104|5.0|Christopher, the protagonist and narrator of this novel, is a 15-year-old autistic boy, who also happens to be very bright.  I guess only someone who is autistic themselves can say whether or not the author &quot;got it right&quot; - but it is certainly convincing. If the book gives an accurate depiction of how an autistic mind works, it is also a brilliant interpretation of those workings for the non-autistic reader.  Christopher himself may be utterly incapable of empathy - but anyone who reads the book will empathize with him - and with his immensely likeable and much-tried parents.  Christopher doesn't understand emotions - but his disability also means that he is unable to feel sorry for himself, and he is brave and persistent in his attempt to sort out what is wrong with his world.  At the same time, the book is very funny indeed.  I hope we see some more from Mark Haddon.
B00003CXIY|5.0|I own around 60 dvd's ive had this one for about 2 years now , ive watched it more than anyone of my dvd's. This dvd is one of thoughs really rare movies that where you can watch it over and over and still be entertained i also really liked that there is a big difference from the unr8ed one then the normal one. This dvd contains excellent extra features and i garuntee youll love it. If you like movies like American Pie you'll really like this.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I have read all kinds of vampire books (and a few on werewolves) and it seems though some authors tend to stick to the same existance for both (no reflection, holy water, silver bullets), it always seems nice to me to either read a story or see a movie that is courageous enough to be different and to create their own rules.  I didn't see Underworld as a love story (I guess the love between Lucien and Viktor's daughter could seem that way) and the funny thing is after it was over and my husband asked me what I thought, I told him &quot;It wasn't gory at all but it had to have blood in it since it was about vampires and werewolves&quot; and then I watched the movie, and one of the people said a similar thing so I guess I got what they were trying to do.  I was amazed that there were REAL people in those werewolf suits (I wish they would have gotten a real person to play the Hulk but that is a whole nother issue) because they wanted the audience to see how real looking they could be made to look.  I was facinated by the way Michael looked after Lucien told Selene to bite him and what happened afterwards.  Even though they didn't show the vampires actually taking blood from people, I think they were actually drinking blood at one point in the movie (or at least it looked like a red colored substance in glasses).  There are so many ways of writing a story like this and I believe a good job was done in the making of the movie from the settings, (being so dark and gloomy - the movie IS called Underworld) the thirst (excuse the pun) for power, a struggle (that was based on a lie) between two species and an ending that leads me to believe that there will be a second Underworld.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I was looking forward to this film because I am a huge fan of Marvel movies and I really really loooved spiderman so i thought theyd make this one just as good , although this movie was good i think it fell short of my expectations maybe if spiderman was never made this wouldve been better but spiderman raised the bar but this is still a good movie. In conclusion unless you absolutely love this comic book don't buy this or at least rent it first .
B00003CXB4|5.0|I loved this movie. The new song is great! I loved the safari. There were lots of extras. I love this movie. I am a big fan and I have always been. I hope they make more Lion King movies. It made more of a bond between animals and us. The best movie just got better!
B000031WD9|5.0|This is such a funny,crzy, and gross movie but you will enjoy it and laugh for hours. The unrated version isn't that much different from the normal one exept maybe 1 or 2 more minutes of nudity but to tell you the truth i couldn't tell a difference. Still this movie is hillarious and should be in everyones dvd collection.
B000002H33|5.0|That's what this album is. Metal played to its perfection. I have never heard anything of this magnitude of any album I have ever listened to. From start to finish this is the album that reached the apex of what a band can do. This album is lyrically and musically the best album metallica has ever put out.The first track off the album battery is absolutely phenominal. A great way to begin this album. After hearing this first song you might ask yourself,How does this get better? Well Metallica did not fail in delivering their most powerful and heavy album yet.Pound for pound this is their best work ever.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I went into this movie hearing bad things and then not expecting much, but, i was actually enjoying it. The action was good and there was some humore in parts and I liekd the storyline.....that was until it got near the end.. i dunno what the heck happen but it was like a joke the movie just totally went downhill and all this crazy stuff started happening. I give the first 70% of the movie 4 stars and the last 2. It was a dissapointment.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is very good. (...) Trial Of The Incredible Hulk didn't give me what I wanted from a movie featuring Daredevil. Captain America, Vampirella, and The Fantastic Four also failed to meet my expectations. Remember Superman 3? I don't even want to mention how many novels Ive read that have gotten mangled into movies. Daredevil isn't exactly everybody's favorite character so I never thought I'd see anything this close to the comics on a mainstream movie screen. It could have been so much less dark and gritty and kiddie oriented. They made some changes, and there are flaws, but it's still very good.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I have always had some interest in Sound Garden but none in Rage Against The Machine, but that doesn't even matter nymore because audioslave is 10X better then both. The instruments on this album are insanely amazing and Chris Cornells voice is at his best Each song on this cd is great and different and couldve been the first single. This is easily one of the best cd's in the last 5 years. Also it will cover a range of people I like bands like tool and APC and i like audioslave but i know people who like totally different bands than me but like this. This cd is excellent and one can not have a complete cd collection without it.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|I tried to see Wicked on Broadway by trying for the lottery a couple of times.  The odds are not great--hundreds of people show up for those 28 tickets they set aside.  So, I figured I'd buy the CD to at least get a taste of the music.  The CD is okay.  The show has a stellar cast, performers who are not only talented actors and singers, but also highly unique people, and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing their roles.  BUT, the music is not very interesting or clever.  I skipped through a lot of the songs, skimmed over them, read the lame lyrics in the liner notes.  Not much to write home about.  <br />&quot;Popular&quot; is a good song, but the rest of the score is pretty boring, and the actors sound as if they are searching for some meaning beneath the music and lyrics that sound as if the composer threw the whole thing together on his lunch hour.<br />The soundtrack killed any desire I had to see the show, as much as I love IM, KC, et. al.  As in many Hollywood films, the actors are above the material.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I fell in love with the soundtrack to Fellowship when it came out, and could not expect that the next two installments would be as wonderful. The Two Towers was satisfying, nearly as good, but this one is truly fantastic.<br />Near the beginning we spend a lot of time in Gondor, away from the familiar musical themes from the last 2 films but with exciting new ones to hear instead. The tension builds all the way up to &quot;The End of All Things,&quot; which really puts you right back into the climax of the movie. After that comes a flood of joy when all the old familiar themes come back in the last three tracks -- which are some of my favorite film music ever, and which make &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; (a beautiful piece from the first film) look like kid stuff.<br />Vocal turns from Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd are welcome, and Annie Lennox's ending song concludes the album beautifully and appropriately. I recommend this CD to anyone who has seen the movie, and also to anyone who hasn't.
0142800031|4.0|I actually ended up liking this audiobook.  Never having been a great fan of Follett's work, Pillars of the Earth being an exception, I actually found myself getting into the story.  By no means is this great literature, but if you accept it for the excapist fun that it is, you can really get into the story of women spies during World War II.  I really liked the character of Flick; although, at times she could be a little over the top.  Some of Follett's historical accuracy was questionable, but this is &quot;fiction,&quot; so I didn't worry about it too much.  As for the narrator, Kate Reading is excellent.  I've listened to several books narrated by Ms. Reading, Anne Rice's Pandora being one of the better, and she never disappoints.  This bit of escapist fun is great listening for workouts.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I don't hate this season, but it definitly isn't the best even disregarding its incredible shortness. This season seemed less funny than the previous and the plots of the episodes were way less creative. it definitly isn't worth the price.
B000002UJQ|5.0|it took me over a year before i could dig into this album...its unique sounds and melodies hurt my ears at first, having listened to bands like reel big fish etc.. once i was hooked, its been with me ever since(at least 4 years now...)as my second favorite album. ths piece of art has brought me to tears. paraniod android is the most beautiful song ever written, by anyone, in any style. thoms voice is smooth like chocolate, and coupled with johnnys abrasive guitar makes for excellent contrast. everyone in the band gets an A for note choice. i took 2 years music theory, and 2 years jazz theory, and whereas my knoledge of music somewhat wilted my love for some rock(the three chord dronings of todays modern music) it helped me appreciate this band even more. each member of radiohead has its own voive. very rarely will any of the 3 guitarists be playing the same notes, let alone the same thing. bass player Ed has the melody countless times(ex. airbag, exit music for a film), instead of just playing the bass note on the guitar like 98% of other rock bassists. and the way phillip(drummer) and ed lock and sound like one instrument. a must have for any music lover. for anybody looking to go beyond green day.coupled with the bends, all the music you will ever need to get through any crisis, or appreciate a beautiful moment.
055357342X|5.0|If you like mature storytelling not typical good vs evil, give it a try.
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid is awesome, I've been supporting them since I heard their first CD \\"Rancid 1993\\" was realesed.  Before Rancid I've been listing to The Clash, Anti-Flag, Misfits, Operation Ivy, The Virus, Dead Kennedys, Exploited, Sex Pistols, etc. But when Rancid was realesed, I listend to their CD's constantly, I also went to Operation Ivy's last concert was I admitt was radical.  This CD isn't really considered the best for hardcore punk music. This is basicaly good for Ska, raggae, and maybe some emo lovers.  Even punkers enjoy it.  Really, it's your opinion on if you like Tim's and Lar's Vocals.  But you just can't resist Matt's god like bass tunes.  If you want a CD to listen to when your bored, or your in a happy/or sad mood this CD is great for you.
0385504209|4.0|This book was recomended to me by my sister because she liked it so much. I read it and I have to say I feel the same way. It was a great mystery with so much historical reference it was amazing. I couldn't help but think how incredible smart Dan Brown must be to know this. I suggest this book to almost anyway. The only down fall was the the end seemed to drag on a little too long, but none the less a great read.
0316666343|5.0|While Sebold creates a wonderful character in Susie, it is the relationships between the other characters that made the book amazing.
B00009XITQ|5.0|I saw this movie at a friend's house and totally loved it. The cast was excellent (Colin Firth, Kelly Preston, and more), and so was the story. A very heartwarming and cute movie. Yes, it was a little like 'The Parent Trap' and 'The Princess Diaries', but it was its own movie with its own charm. <br />17-year-old NYC girl Daphne Reynolds goes on a search to find her father, a British politician, who has been MIA all her life. You'll find out more when you watch the movie. Amanda Bynes (I'm a big fan of her now) played her part so well! She's clumsy, quirky, hip, different, and likeable. Colin Firth was great! Especially the father/daughter scenes between those two characters. A[...] <br />Anyways, I know this may not be a very informative review, but watch this movie, girls! (and parents, too!) I actually gotta buy the DVD for myself, soon, so I can stop pestering my friend to watch it again and again when I go over there! :)
0060264306|5.0|The first book of the Little House series that has become an (North) American classic.  When I first read this book as a child I was thoroughly mesmerized by Wilder's evocative portrayal of pioneer life in the \\"big woods\\" of western Wisconsin.  The book's pertinant underlying theme is the importance of the family unit, and the perserverance of the human spirit through times of hardship.  It should not be forgotten, however, that the book is an idealization, a toned-down version, of pioneer life.  Wilder was later accused of distorting and fabricating her stories, an aligation which shocked her because it had been her intention to write stories, not history.  But that, I guess, is irrelevant to the children that this book--and those of the series--was intended for.
B00005OM4N|3.0|When I first heard it I thought,Oh my God,is it ALL she has made for this year?I was a little bit disappointing,really.This album sounds absolutely different but it doesn't mean it sounds better.OK.Let's begin from the start.After as I have already said I listened to it for the first time I straight chose the songs that I thought I wouldn't like in any way.BUT!Guess what?On all these songs that I didn't like she made videos!So you know them now.And after she did it I started to like these songs:)OK.Here are my ratings(try to be not that strict):<BR>1.I'm A Slave 4 You-I didn't like it at first but then it seemed to be ok,let it be 7/10<BR>2.Overprotected-I liked it from the very beginning.Great song!-8.5/10<BR>3.Lonely-one of those songs that have faded into the background of the album.I bet,not more people have heard this song-6/10<BR>4.I'm Not A Girl-just brilliant!10/10<BR>5.Boys-one more exception:)Seemed to be like &quot;nothing special&quot;but after she made video on it I thought it's not that bad-7.5/10<BR>6.Anticipating-one of those background songs but to my mind the best of them-6.5/10<BR>7.I Love Rock'n'Roll-it seemed to be too heavy for me at first but then I realized(again after the video)that this song's good-8/10<BR>8.Cinderella-not a bad song but not popular at all-6.5/10<BR>9.Let Me Be-5.5/10 <BR>10.Bombastic Love-quite fast,I like it-7/10<BR>11.That's Where You Take Me-6.5/10 again,nothing special<BR>12.What It's Like To Be Me-absolutely nothing special,even more &quot;nothing special&quot;than the previous one-5/10<BR>PS:Once again I was quite honest(i.e.strict)
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am a die hard Alien fan.  I have read just about all of the comics, have books, and own multiple copies/versions of each film.  This is the best set to date.  I would recommend it to just about any Alien fan (or sci-fi fan for that matter).  I have had this set for about a week now and I still haven't hit all the features.<br />My two favorite films in the series are Alien and Alien 3.  Now before you freak out and say &quot;Alien 3?  Is this guy nuts?!&quot;, let me explain.  I am also a huge David Fincher fan.  I believe that his films are some of the most influential to date.  Now Alien 3 is not his best film, that is sure.  But, I have to commend him for what he did.  He took a corporate hacked, practically useless storyline and made it very watchable.  He didn't even have a script!  That alone amazes me.  He presented a very unique and interesting vision in the Alien series that really sets it apart from the rest.  He also brought back some of the suspense from the original Alien which was overshadowed by action in the second installment (which is also a great film by the way).  In any case, that is my second favorite.  My first is Alien of course.  Why not?  It is in fact THE original film and is a complete display of Giger's original design.<br />Nonetheless, this is a great set for the price and as far as I know the 9th disc is only available in it which is a definite plus.  My only concern is the lack of involvement of Fincher in Alien 3.  I know that he doesn't agree with the extended cut, but I want him to know that at least one person enjoyed the additional and alternate scenes.  I thought that they enhanced the story positively, while bringing the characters to life in a way we haven't been able to see before.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I can say my ratings of the songs on this album.Here they are:<BR>Me Against The Music-it's not the best choice for her first single from this album in my opinion,so it has 6.5/10.<BR>(I Got That)Boom Boom-in the beginning I didn't like it at all but some time later I started to like it,so it has 6.5/10.<BR>Showdown-so average song,still don't like it so much,6/10.<BR>Breathe On Me-great song,one of my favorite on the album!!It's quite different from all the other songs here.It has 7.5/10.<BR>Early Morning-could be better,I think(sorry,Moby)-5/10.<BR>Toxic-so cheerful song,I liked ot from the very beginning.It has 7/10.<BR>Outrageous-I most of all like her bridge in the end of the song,more than the chorus and the rest.It has 6/10.<BR>Touch Of My Hand-so fantastic!!I love it even now!It's about sex ,though,I don't care.I give it 9.5/10.<BR>The Hook Up-one more average song,but kinda not so average-6.5/10.<BR>Shadow-I can't say I'm a slow songs fan but I liked this one-9/10.<BR>Brave New Girl-that's it!THIS song was and still my favorite on the album!It's just great!10/10.<BR>Everytime-also 10/10,this slow is really nice too,though Britney's voice it's hard to hear.<BR>+Bonus tracks:<BR>Me Against The Music-I'm not a fan of all this remix thing at all but I liked this one-7/10(just for remix).<BR>The Answer-now it's playing in my head and it means that this song isn't that bad,it's well-made and it has 6.5-7/10.<BR>Don't Hang Up-nothing special-5/10<BR>PS:Seemed to be quite strict,huh?But believe me I really love Britney so-so much and I tried to be objective.
B000001FZK|5.0|Brilliant.<br />I regard this ablum as pure genius, an absolutely unparalleled work of musical amazment--it rolls like warm water over your body, comforts one moment like cool, linen sheets, then disturbs the next like spider webs in your face or something crawling in your ear...Also, the album flows seamlessly from one song to the other in such fluid, but dynamic continuity that I have a hard time regarding the ablum as a collection of songs, but rather consider it one brilliant piece of gorgeous, disturbing music. The album is an experience that stimulates all of my senses, too, I FEEL this album, I envision this music, I taste it, smell it...it is SO real! Simply amazing!
B00004SCX6|4.0|I liked it since the first time I heard it.Here's just my songs review:<BR>1.Oops!I Did It Again-8/10-good song as all from this album,though:)<BR>2.Stronger-didn't like it first but then it was ok-8/10<BR>3.Don't Go Knockin' On My Door-good enough,6.5/10<BR>4.(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction-she performed this song really good,just 7.5/10<BR>5.Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know-8/10,perfect slow!<BR>6.What You See-what can I say?Just GOOD!-7.5/10<BR>7.Lucky-in general it has about 8/10 but as I've heard it million times already I give it now 7/10<BR>8.One Kiss From You-7/10,nice song,used to be my fave ever.<BR>9.Where Are You Now-good slow,8/10<BR>10.Can't Make You Love Me-7/10,this song's theme is what I like about it<BR>11.When You Eyes Say It-my favorite slow on this album,I love it so much!-9.5/10<BR>12.Dear Diary-very honest song-9/10<BR>+Bonus track<BR>13.Girl In The Mirror-I liked it and still like-9/10.<BR>Even though my ratings aren't that high I can say I love this album!!It's her best album so far now I think.
0375703764|4.0|House of Leaves is not light reading. That's one fact you should be aware of before you pick it up. It's not even heavy reading; it's in a class of it's own. The story as best it can be described, is a mix of two stories at once that somehow connect to each other. The first is of Johnny Truant and Zampano, the second of The Navidson family and their experience in the house they live which ultimately becomes a series of home tapings of the events later called The Navidson Record.<br />The book is filled with hundreds of footnotes, strange sentence structure, omissions, two appendixes, a set of letters from Johnny Truant's mother to him during her stay in a mental institution called The Three Attic Whalestoe Letters (now a seperate book in their own right), collages, photos, poems and other odd bits and pieces; an editors worst nightmare.<br />But don't let that detour you; if your willing to sit down and read something to challenge your mind, and maybe even scare you (in the sense of chilling suspense rather than horror), then this is the book for you.
B0000508U6|5.0|A rush of blood to the head was the first album I owned by Coldplay and it was really a great album! It's probably my favorite rock album of 2003. So, since that album was so good I decided to try parachutes. Parachutes was almost as good but it was better than &quot;Brothers and Sisters. I like how Coldplay does their music. It can be very soft in some parts and loud in other parts. It's very different than Lenny Kravitz, who is another one of my favorite musicians. The whole album was very good.<br />  &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is my favorite track on the album and it's a great way to start. It's a soft song with great lyrics and music. Then, at the beginning of &quot;Shiver&quot; it becomes louder. My other favorites are: spies, yellow, trouble and everything's not lost.<br />  This is definitly an album worth looking into.
0679428895|2.0|If you are expecting a well-crafted, literary historical novel (regarding the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in ancient Greece), you will be disappointed. this book seems to have been designed for a mass audience. the plot of this book is not very imaginative or interesting and the prose is annoyingly slick.  Finally, there is neither much detail regarding the history of ancient greece nor to volcanology, either of which might have provided more redeeming value for this book.
B0000067L2|4.0|My favorite part of the album is staring at the kalidiscope cover.  <br />Strange Brew, Sunshine of Your Love, and Tales of Brave Ulyssses may be the three best songs.  Not Bad for a listen.  Might even get better the more you listen to it.  Not my favorite but fun.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This is the best album to be released in 2003, by a long shot. Really great rock n roll songs that everyone can sing a long to with great anthems. I would like to say that if anyone disagrees with me please contact me on liveforeverman@hotmail.com to say why, cos i wil not understand you
B000059T00|5.0|Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton are two of the most musicaly genious people ever.  Now wonder the one album they made together is such a classic.  <br />'Had to cry today' has an amazing riff<br />'Can't Find My Way Home' is sad and catchy<br />'Well Alright' By for the most pop savy song on the album, but certainly an entertaing one to listen to.<br />'Prescense of the Lord' The only song on the album Clapton wrote, and it is one of his many classics.  Good lyrics.<br />'Do what you like' ok<br />This is an entertaing and exciting album.<br />Steve Winwood is a cool guy<BR>Eric Clapton may be a mean SOB but can sure play the guitar
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this movie.  This edition has more extras than the other dvd and I'm getting it.  I prefer fullscreen to widescreen-widescreen is distracting to watch- all that black space at the top and bottom of the screen.  Full screen fills up the entire screen and I can get into the movie more.  I know- if it was shot in widescreen- we are missing part of the picture.  I didn't know til I read other reviews that it is so much of the picture- I never saw this movie in widescreen to know the difference.  To satisfy everybody, and watch one when you don't want the distraction of the black bars, and one when you don't want to miss any of the picture, the special edition should have both versions.  Some dvds do have both versions.  Maybe the'll come out with a version with both on it, and all the extras.  Until then, you can buy this for the full screen edition and the extras, as well as the widescreen edition- without the extras.  They should shoot all movies in full screen- that way we'd have no bars and we wouldn't be missing any of the movie- some movies are shot this way.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Mother and daughter Tess and Anna Coleman just don't get along.  Tess embarrasses teenage Anna to no end and is so busy planning a wedding she doesn't realize her daughter is growing up.  Anna resents the new man in the family and wants to be treated as a grown-up, even if she's not responsible enough yet.<br />Then one Friday, they wake up to discover they've been transported into each other's bodies.  Now Tess has to go to school and see what Anna's world is really like.  And Anna must act like a grown-up whether she wants to or not.  But can they figure out how to switch back before Tess walks down the aisle?<br />I actually have never seen the original or read the book, but as soon as I heard about this movie, I had to see it because of Lindsay Lohan.  I became an instant fan with her work in \\"The Parent Trap\\" remake, and this movie impressed me even more.  She made playing a grown-up trapped in a teen's body completely believable.  Jamie Lee Curtis is equally wonderful as a grown-up who really isn't.  The supporting cast is wonderful as they try to coup with the weirdness going on around them that they can't possibly understand.  I laughed the entire way through the movie and choked up with tears at the end.  (I cry at the drop of a hat, what can I say?)<br />The DVD is well worth buying.  Not only do you get the fun movie, but you get a few cool extras.  They have a deleted scene with director commentary (and he was right to delete it), and two alternative endings.  The bloopers reel was fun, as were the two music video's from the soundtrack.  There is a seven minute back stage featurette this is also worth checking out.  I would have loved to see an audio commentary or two, especially one including Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan, but it's not to be found.  The movie itself is presented in both widescreen and full frame formats, with a wonderful picture.  The full surround sound is great as well.<br />Truly fun movies the entire family can enjoy together are a rare treat.  Jump on this one while you can.  Everyone will have an evening of pleasant entertainment.re a rare treat.  Jump on this one while you can.  Everyone will have an evening of pleasant entertainment.
B00008HCCF|5.0|This is a well recorded concert DVD and an excellent value. Both the picture quality and the sound quality are very good. Everyone I've shown it to has loved it and several have bought it for their own collection. In addition to watching it as a concert, it makes very nice background music during dinner. We like it so much that we've used it as a gift on a couple of occasions where a small gift would be appropriate.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Believe it or not, you can explain Mulholland Drive with a reasonably straightforward, even believable, story, and without just waving your hand and saying, &quot;It's all just Dianne's dream.&quot;  Well, it IS just Dianne's dream, or at least the first 2/3 of it are, but there are dreams and then again there are dreams...<br />I won't spoil it by posting what I think is the explanation (though I've posted it elsewhere), but I will say this: it's a great movie, though maybe not for everyone.  There are a couple of lesbian love scenes which could turn off the prudish, and working out a satisfying explanation for it all may require multiple viewings, which many (probably most) may find to be a waste of time.  But it has a fine noirish feel to it, especially with the brooding musical score apparently contributed by none other than a sinister espresso-spewing tycoon/mobster. ;-)  Naomi Watts gives a particularly enthralling performance as Diane/Betty.  An absolute must if you just can't get enough of those flicks with a dark, moody feel to them.
B0000025D0|5.0|Although Darkness On The Edge Of Town is a dark album, it is not uniformly gloomy since its despairing moments are often spectacularly swept away by powerful blasts of defiance bursting forth in songs like The Promised Land or Badlands (\\"We'll keep pushin' till it's understood/and these badlands start treating us good\\").<br />There is an awesome grandeur in the tone and the sound, driven as it is by majestic guitars, thunderous drums, sweeping sax and wailing harmonica. The myth of the highway and the freedom it offers, following on from Born To Run, is most dramatically explored in songs like Racing In The Streets and Streets Of Fire.<br />The redemptive power of love surfaces on the beautiful Prove It All Night, whilst the title track is melancholy and erotic at the same time, a brooding ballad of evocative imagery. This is classic Springsteen, a very cohesive album that displays his mastery of both the fast-paced rock song and the introspective ballad. Powerful music.
0061015725|3.0|I wasn't terribly impressed with Crichton's latest offering.  While I read the Andromeda Strain cover to cover in one setting, I found Prey to be a whole lot of hype with very little payoff.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Although I really enjoyed APC's first cd it doesn't even compare to this one. I'd have to say Maynard is a vocal genius who brings life into every one of their songs. More of an APC fan than of Tool I loved this album with it's more mellow tracks such as The Noose and The Nurse who Loved me. The songs on this cd drag you into the music and you can feel the raw emotions expressed in the general sound of the songs. I certainly reccomend this to anyone and everyone, even if they aren't usually a Tool or APC fan. Anyone who has any love for music will see that this isn't just a cd but a piece of art.
B000021Y77|3.0|Run Lola Run has a very different style of directing - fast motion, panning shots, intersparsed with dark, slow scenes intended to draw out the viewer's emotion.  I have to give credit where credit is due, and in that regard Run Lola Run is something completely different.<br />In the same breath (and without giving any spoilers), the main premise of the movie is one you won't soon forget.<br />But even with the unique directing style, the definitive concept of the story, and the good performances by the cast, there's something lacking about this film.  I couldn't feel the characters, I couldn't put myself in their shoes.  I couldn't find a reason to feel sad or happy even though there were several scenes where the director's intent was to do just that.  The movie lacked depth and emotion.<br />If you're a film student and you want to see a different style of directing, see this movie.  If you find enjoyment in watching something new, plot twists rarely seen before, see this movie.  But if your enjoyment in movies comes from emotion and passion, feeling the characters and experiencing the story with your mind AND your heart, this movie isn't for you.
B000002H33|5.0|There is not one song I even remotely dislike about this album. What can I say except that Master of Puppets rocks? The album starts off with a mellow opening to the first track, Battery. Then, all of a sudden, it goes into thrash mode and just kicks your a$$! This song practically defines thrash metal. <br />Then we go into the legendary Master of Puppets, a song about the effects of drug abuse. This song would make a great song to celebrate Red Ribbon Week at your school...that is, if they do that sort of thing. That song is the most common favorite song among Metallica fans, and I can see why. From the heavy riffs, the solo, and everything else, that song has it all. <br />Next up, The Thing That Should Not Be. Some say that this song shouldn't be on this album, but my question is &quot;Why not?&quot; It's deep, it's heavy, and it's haunting. What's not to like? <br />Now we move on to the ballad of the album, Sanitarium. Metallica have been criticized for making ballads back when Ride the Lightning was released, but the people who criticized them really should think about why. Even if the ballads are softer than their other stuff, they still have their hardcore parts. Sanitarium changes from soft to hardcore at the point of Kirk's solo. So I guess you could say that song has a little something for everybody. <br />We now move to Disposable Heroes, another thrash song about war. The lyrics are extremely deep and thought-provoking, and the guitar riffs are pure metal. Another awesome song. <br />Now we move to the next track, Leper Messiah. I find this song to be underrated. I know it's not as thrashy as some of the other stuff on this album, but so what? It can still spit out some poetic lyrics, electric guitars, and crazy solo, can't it? <br />Next up, Orion, a legendary instrumental. Cliff Burton's skill on the bass was definitely shown in this song. Plus, a band's ability to do instrumentals proves that they can make good music without poetry. <br />We're coming down to the final track, Damage, Inc. If you look up &quot;thrash metal&quot; in the dictionary, you will see this song. Like Battery, it starts out slow and then all of a sudden goes into a full-on thrashfest! My personal favorite Metallica song. Overall, Master of Puppets is a must-have for any metalhead.
B00000637V|5.0|pink floyds album the wall is usually said to be the singular most depressing album ever. and its true, it is an extremely depressing album. but this masterwork by lou reed completely changed my mind on that. i had heard about this album for a while, but was a little unsure if i wanted this album. i had heard it was extremely depressing, and i didn't want to get into a deep derpessing over the summer (i get depressed real easily). so i got some of lous other stuff like new york, transformer, and the blue mask, until i finally got up the courage to listen to this. well, the reviews were dead on, this album is extremely depressing. mr. reeds lyrics, and the song structuures, along with bob ezrins great production make this an extremely satisfing listen. although it takes great courage to listen to, you will be rewarded greatly. the title track starts it off, with a sort of avant garde begiining, while singing happy birthday to caroline, one of the albums main characters. lou sounds very alone on this song, accompanied by nothing but a piano that sounds like lounge jazz. lady day is  a great song that i've always been trying to describe, but i can't. i get a feel from this song, along with the title track, that make me feel like i'm in some sort of drug induced tropical place, maybe berlin itself. i couldn't tell you, i've never been there. i had the great pleasure of seeing lou perform men of good fortune, along with the bed, and how do you think it feels, this summer while attending one of his concerts in phoenix. its a great song. caroline says 1 is probably the one song on this album i don't like. how do you think it feels has some very good guitar playing in it, courtesy of dick wagner. oh jim sounds extremely layered, and the drums at the beginning are very cool. caroline says 2 is probably one of my favorite songs on the album. it starts with a basic acoustic part, and then fills with lush overdubs, and orchestrations. the kids was the one reason i didn't want to get this album. everyone has said that the children screaming at the end was extremely disturbing. but to tell you the truth, while it was pretty eeire, ti was not as frightening as i expected. the bed is without a doubt the most depressing song ever written. watching lou stand dead center, alone on a dark stage, in the second row performing this song was very disturbinig, but very cool. while most lyricists would toy around with suicide in their words, lou gets directly to the point ( this is the place that she cut her wrists) the end of this song is creepy, until the flute to sad song starts, sounding like a butterfly coming out of its cacoon(yeah i know i ripped off the other reiviewers thing, but theres no other way to describe it. get this album. its a harrowing and disturbing effort, but its worht it.
B00000724P|5.0|Simply put, this album rocks! Just like Master of Puppets, there is not one song I even remotely dislike on this album. People say this album sucks because of its raw production, and I'll admit the production is rather raw, but it's the music that matters, and ...And Justice For All excels in that department. Sure, you may not be able to hear the bass, but the crushing guitar riffs more than make up for it.<br />This album starts off with a pure metal song called Blackened. This song has everything: thought-provoking lyrics about the end of the world (makes you think, doesn't it?), rockin' riffs, and a killer solo. Tied with Damage, inc. from Master of Puppets as my all-time favorite Metallica song.<br />Now, on to the title track. It starts off with a mellow first 40 seconds, but then goes to rock your socks off. Some say this song drags on a little too long (9 minutes and 44 seconds), but those almost 10 minutes will not by any means be wasted by listening to this song.<br />Next, Eye of the Beholder. A very interesting song. It's a very heavy song too, might I add. The lyrics are very poetic in this song.<br />Then comes One. This song has it all. Fans of the softer Metallica music will enjoy listening to the beginning of the song, and hardcore fans can headbang to the last 3 minutes until their heads get sore. A very powerful song. Metallica have won 2 awards for this song. Firstly, they won their first Grammy award for this song. Plus, the solo was voted #7 in a list of the top 100 rock/metal solos. It deserves #1, though. Trust me.<br />Now we move on to a song I find extremely underrated, called The Shortest Straw. When I first listened to this song, it was stuck in my head for a couple weeks. The Shortest Straw is extremely catchy and pretty thrashy. You could headbang to this song all day long!<br />Next up, Harvester of Sorrow. In my mind, this is Metallica's heaviest song. It's like The Thing That Should Not Be part 2. It's very heavy, and it's very dark.<br />On to The Frayed Ends of Sanity, another underrated song. This song starts off with a Wizard of Oz reference, and then goes into Metallica heavy metal mode. Another good headbanging song.<br />Next up, To Live Is To Die, a salute to the late Cliff Burton, who died a few months after Master of Puppets was released. This song could be considered an instrumental, since the only lyrics are only a few lines written by Cliff Burton himself before the bus accident. But still, it's a VERY powerful song.<br />Finally, Dyers Eve. This song is very thrashy and aggressive. It's a perfect song to listen to when your parents give you grief. Just don't let them hear it. This song is like my anthem. I can totally relate to it.<br />Overall, ...And Justice For All is another masterpiece. A must-have for any metalhead.
0425173739|5.0|I recently read \\"Death on the Nile\\", by Agatha Christie, and the book left me astonished. The ingenious crafting of murder was impressive and the end, as usual, in her books, a complete mystery. It was a pleasure from the beginning to the end.  A story of intrigue and romance, of money and passion, and of course, of murder had me reading it in one sittting.            Linnet Ridgeway, a beautiful and very wealthy heiress, has everything. And what she doesn't have she obtains. Her best friend, Jackie De Belleforte longs for everything Linnet has. And when she introduces her new fianc Simon to Linnet, Linnet takes that too. Simon and Linnet are married and go on a honeymoon to Egypt, only to find Jackie following them wherever they go. They are quite displeased with the way she demonstrates her anger. But as a number of mysterious accidents begin to happen, the famous detective Hercule Poirot is ready for them. One night, Linnet is murdered, and the most likely person, Jackie, has an alibi confirmed by five people. But who could have killed Linnet? And why? That I leave to the eager readers, but I extremely enjoyed this, and as all Christie books, this is a true mystery. I am glad I read this, and it is very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries.
B00000JCRH|5.0|There is not one song I even remotely dislike about this album. What can I say except that Master of Puppets rocks? The album starts off with a mellow opening to the first track, Battery. Then, all of a sudden, it goes into thrash mode and just kicks your a$$! This song practically defines thrash metal. <br />Then we go into the legendary Master of Puppets, a song about the effects of drug abuse. This song would make a great song to celebrate Red Ribbon Week at your school...that is, if they do that sort of thing. That song is the most common favorite song among Metallica fans, and I can see why. From the heavy riffs, the solo, and everything else, that song has it all. <br />Next up, The Thing That Should Not Be. Some say that this song shouldn't be on this album, but my question is \\"Why not?\\" It's deep, it's heavy, and it's haunting. What's not to like? <br />Now we move on to the ballad of the album, Sanitarium. Metallica have been criticized for making ballads back when Ride the Lightning was released, but the people who criticized them really should think about why. Even if the ballads are softer than their other stuff, they still have their hardcore parts. Sanitarium changes from soft to hardcore at the point of Kirk's solo. So I guess you could say that song has a little something for everybody. <br />We now move to Disposable Heroes, another thrash song about war. The lyrics are extremely deep and thought-provoking, and the guitar riffs are pure metal. Another awesome song. <br />Now we move to the next track, Leper Messiah. I find this song to be underrated. I know it's not as thrashy as some of the other stuff on this album, but so what? It can still spit out some poetic lyrics, electric guitars, and crazy solo, can't it? <br />Next up, Orion, a legendary instrumental. Cliff Burton's skill on the bass was definitely shown in this song. Plus, a band's ability to do instrumentals proves that they can make good music without poetry. <br />We're coming down tothe final track, Damage, Inc. If you look up \\"thrash metal\\" in the dictionary, you will see this song. Like Battery, it starts out slow and then all of a sudden goes into a full-on thrashfest! My personal favorite Metallica song. <br />Overall, Master of Puppets is a must-have for any metalhead.
6305078491|4.0|In a small French town, a man named Allen Gray (Julian West) takes a room at an inn. His sleep is interrupted when a strange man (Maurice Shutz) comes into his room speaking incoherently about death. The man leaves a small package with instructions that it should be opened upon his death and departs. Allen gets out of bed and prowls around the inn in search of an explanation, eventually wandering onto a nearby estate where he finds the mysterious man who was in his room living with his two daughters. One of his daughters has been bitten by a vampire, and the house is shrouded in death.<br /><br />&#34;Vampyr&#34; was written by director Carl Theodor Dreyer, who was inspired by the Victorian supernatural tales &#34;In a Glass Darkly&#34; by Seridan Le Fanu. The film has a semi-coherent narrative, but it is primarily an abstract meditation on Death. Dialogue is sparse, in German, sometimes muffled, and not consistently subtitled. The story is also told with text that is displayed between scenes. But it is the film's cinematography and score that do the most to communicate &#34;Vampyr&#34;'s sense of mystery, foreboding, and helplessness. Rudolph Mat&eacute;'s cinematography is truly astounding. I was most struck by the way that the camera just kind of lurks, mimicking Allen's activity as he explores the inn. And Mat&eacute; created some truly effective visual effects in spite of 1932's primitive technology. Wolfgang Zeller's score provides most of the film's audio track and reveals more about the characters' feelings than the spare dialogue does. &#34;Vampyr&#34; won't appeal to those who prefer a strong narrative. It is often abstract. &#34;Vampyr&#34; concerns what goes on in the hearts and minds of characters  facing circumstances beyond their control and understanding -facing death itself, and these things are not explicitly communicated. Carl Dreyer's direction and Rudolph Mat&eacute;'s cinematography are terrifically creative. Recommended if you like abstract tales of death or admire extraordinary early cinematography.<br /><br />Also included on this DVD is an animated short film from 1934 entitled &#34;The Mascot&#34;. This is a fantastic example of early stop-motion animation by director Wladyslaw Starewicz. &#34;The Mascot&#34; was created using puppets or dolls that were photographed one frame at a time in order to animate them. It was certainly the inspiration for Pixar's &#34;Toy Story&#34; and Tim Burton's &#34;The Nightmare Before Christmas&#34;, and a considerable influence on many other modern animated films. &#34;The Mascot&#34; is about a toy dog who is trying to bring an orange back to the little girl who loves him. And you wouldn't believe the obstacles that he encounters. The animation is extraordinary; the dog is adorable beyond words; the story is sweet and sinister all at once. I have never seen such facial expressions in an animated film before. I have rarely seen such creativity. &#34;The Mascot&#34; is, in fact, the best animated film I've ever seen. It is absolutely enchanting! Fans of animation will want this DVD just for &#34;The Mascot&#34;. The film is French, and the few lines of dialogue are dubbed in English. &#34;The Mascot&#34; gets five stars. I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The DVD (Image Entertainment): &#34;Vampyr&#34; starts playing as soon as you insert the disc. And there is no Menu,  only Scene Selections. The disc does not pause between &#34;Vampyr&#34; and &#34;The Mascot&#34;; it just keeps going. If you want to see &#34;The Mascot&#34; without watching &#34;Vampyr&#34;, go to the last scene selection. The print of &#34;Vampyr &#34; isn't very good, especially in the first act. But it's not so bad that it detracts from enjoyment of the film. The print for &#34;The Mascot&#34; is fine. &#34;Vampyr&#34; is subtitled in English only. And, if ever a film would benefit from an audio commentary, &#34;Vampyr&#34; would. But it doesn't have one. So this DVD isn't very wellconstructed. But it contains two important and fascinating examples of 1930s European cinema, both of which are very much worth owning.ascinating examples of 1930s European cinema, both of which are very much worth owning.
052594527X|4.0|Back in 2000, &#34;Girl With a Pearl Earring&#34; became one of the first major novels I had read since John Irving's &#34;The World According to Garp&#34; more than 25 years ago.  As an ex-journalist, I can't explain my aversion to fiction, other than to say that anything akin to &#34;once upon a time&#34; is already six feet under to me.  Truth has always seemed stranger than fiction.<br /><br />I was attracted to this book for one reason.  I was at the Maurithuis Museum at the Hague in the Netherlands in 1996 and saw Vermeer's &#34;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#34; and &#34;A View of Delft&#34; (both pictured on the book's dust jacket) in person.  They are the most unforgettable paintings I have ever seen.  Vermeer's paintings are incredibly hypnotic, drawing us into a time and place that no longer exists.  By virtue of thousands of brush strokes, we are pulled into a time warp which places us into a scene the same surreal way that an old photograph does.<br /><br />This is what author Tracy Chevalier has wonderfully achieved.  Unlike other paintings riddled with religious motifs, nearly all of Vermeer's 35 known works have the ability to force you to think, &#34;Yes, this must have been what ordinary life in Holland was like more than 300 years ago.&#34;  And one can be quite moved by this even if one loathes cheap sentiment.<br /><br />The book's triumph is taking the tangible, that is, the painting which still resides in the Netherlands -- fusing it with what historians know about life in 17th century Holland -- and then concocting something that not only is believable, but plausible, even though our minds are telling us, &#34;But this is still a piece of fiction.&#34;<br /><br />Griet, our heroine, does seems mature beyond her years.  Yet her thoughts are not unbelievable when we remember our own youth, what scared us, moved us, what made us care about what others thought.  We felt wise beyond our years.  Only later did we discover how naive we were, how much more we had yet to learn.<br /><br />Griet's narration reads better if we imagine her telling her story from the point of view of an adult reflecting about her thoughts when she was 16, and not in the present tense, as presented here.  Still, there's a soft rhythm emanating from her narration that doesn't seem pretentious in a way that would call attention to the author's writing style, the mortal sin of any book.  When something is good, we don't think about how words are strung together.  We are so enthralled that time loses all meaning, like a dog whose only notion of it is something nebulous that must last forever.<br /><br />The events which force Griet to work for Vermeer and the tragedy that occurs later, have less emotional impact on Griet as a 17th century girl than if she were a 20th century girl.  They are treated without sappiness.  We watch Griet's transformation as an attractive young woman who is already aware of her effect on men, to something more complex and cunning.  We listen to her efforts to de-feminize herself to deflect unwanted attention, her silly and resigned rationalizations in her trading of dispassionate &#34;minor&#34; sexual favors to achieve her goals, however vague they may seem.  We deduce that Griet is a creature of the moment in her actions, but oddly, in her mind, she is also a girl who has one eye on her own future, as well as her family's.<br /><br />The greatest scenes in the book are the conversations, sparse as they are.  When Vermeer tackles the complex subject of religious attitudes toward paintings and whether they have any relevance to the viewer, despite the fact that his paintings are not riddled with religious themes -- he does so with such clarity and logic -- that it has you soaring into the stratosphere, like listening to Einstein breaking down the theory of relativity into simple language that anyone can understand without being offended.<br /><br />In addition, Griet's efforts to articulate her emotional feelingsabout the master Vermeer are wonderfully conveyed.  She is explicit in almost every other emotion, but never about her growing romantic feelings toward Vermeer.  Yet it is clear in her narration that she loves Vermeer in her own special way.  This, to me, is what others have long said to be the essence of romance.  It is the notion of &#34;what if?&#34; and all that it entails, while the rest is just &#34;life as it all turned out.&#34;<br /><br />The few sexual passages in this book do seem off-kilter to its mostly placid and intelligent tone.  They were necessary to illustrate Griet's awareness of her allure, as well as her low self-image, which betray her confident narrative.  But it would have been better to allude rather than to describe what seems mildly lurid.  My first thought was, &#34;Well, here's the 'PG-13' portion of the book which calls attention to itself.&#34;  The placid tone Chevalier has painstakingly created is now a little jarring, a mild rant against the sufferings inflicted upon women by bestial men throughout time.<br /><br />The book's ending (without giving it away) is &#34;Zhivago-esque&#34; (the movie and not the Pasternak book, though purists say one should never compare apples to oranges).  It is soft, oblique and rich with a wonderful sense of irony and closure.  It has a completeness that takes many other authors several hundred more pages to convey.<br /><br />Turning fiction into reality, mixing facts with a creative extrapolation of how the &#34;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#34; came to be, is the magic all of the world's best writers desire.  Minor faults aside, Chevalier's account is brilliant enough that in my mind, Vermeer's painting is now inextricably linked to Chevalier's book.<br /><br />The girl now has a name and her name is Griet.  The result, quite eerily, is this. After reading &#34;Girl With a Pearl Earring&#34; -- how can anyone look into those luminous eyes of the girl in Vermeer's painting -- in quite the same way again?about her growing romantic feelings toward Vermeer.

B0000C7PQK|5.0|This newest album of Enigma's is absolutely amazing. <br /> &quot;Voyageur&quot; is completely different from any of their previous albums, having none of the samples or the ethnic Gregorian chants that dominated their first four albums. <br /> This newest album is more of a trip-hop and New Age/ Dance album with some mainstream appeal in some of the songs. The only thing that reminds me of any of their older albums is that trademark horn intro in the opening track &quot;From East To West&quot; but taht melts into an original song altogether and it's amazing. <br /> &quot;Incognito&quot; is a grating in my opinion especially with the annoying voice at the beginning. <BR> <BR> However I love the final track &quot;Following The Sun&quot; which is a very intense and uplifting, cheerful song worthy of being released as a single in the near future. I especially love how the song ends on a dark note, ending the album. <br /> Do not listen to these negative reviews. &quot;Voyageur&quot; is a smartly produced album and Cretu was ready to leave behind the &quot;Sadeness&quot; Enigma and move forward with a new facelift for Enigma and I'm proud of it! <br /> You will not be dissapointed by any means! Buy it today!
B00005K9QP|4.0|The cover art says it all. The title of this album is Bluesbreakers: John Mayall With Eric Clapton. Actually, the title should be ERIC CLAPTON ON GUITAR, with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers helping out a bit. There it is in a nutshell. Pretty much the only reason a budding or experienced blues/rock fanatic would want to get this album is for the stellar, incendiary guitar work of ex-Yardbird, soon-to-be Cream member Eric Clapton. His luscious, fluid playing once again set the bar a little higher and could not be equalled until Jeff Beck and James Marshall Hendrix came to town. Does that mean this is a boring album with great guitar solos? Heavens, no. While he will never be mistaken for Paul Rodgers, John Mayall is a fine singer in his own right and his voice works well for this material. His impassioned singing on &quot;Little Girl&quot; is particularly fine, his keyboard playing complements Eric's guitar quite nicely on the Freddie King classic &quot;Hideaway,&quot; and he directs and leads the band through several other standouts, including &quot;All Your Love,&quot; &quot;Parchman Farm,&quot; and Robert Johnson's seminal &quot;Ramblin' On My Mind.&quot; (The latter number featuring an excellent vocal from Eric as well.) However, there are some problems, most notably the use of horns, which add nothing of consequence to several songs and almost ruin an otherwise fabulous take of &quot;Double Crossing Time.&quot; Ray Charles mega-classic &quot;What'd I Say&quot; is similarly hampered by a lengthy and pointless drum solo from the otherwise capable Hughie Flint. Bassist John McVie, who would progress from Mayall to practically printing his own currency with Fleetwood Mac, is delightfully rock-solid and unobtrusive. But no matter. The majesty of Clapton's guitar work rises up like the Phoenix (or Hoover) and sweeps away all objections in its path. Magical!! So, get Bluesbreakers today to enjoy Eric's playing while he lasts in the all-too-unforgiving world of music. At this pace, he can't have but another 30 or 40 years left to play!!!
B000002UCN|3.0|5 stars for the music, 0 stars for the thought behind this compilation. Now this would be my choice for a George Harrison best of (at least from his Apple label days):<br />My Sweet Lord, What Is Life, Isn't it a Pity (WHY isn't this included?), Awaiting On You All, Beware Of Darkness, All Things Must Pass, Bangla Desh, Deep Blue (B side that ought to be included somewhere, about the death of his mother, I believe), Give Me Love, Miss O'Dell (B-side only release of Give Me Love), Living In the Material World, Dark Horse, I Don't Care Anymore (B-side, Dark Horse single), Ding Dong Ding Dong (a single, you know--why isn't it here??), You, (This Guitar) Can't Keep from Crying (another single from Extra Texture).<br />I compiled this listing in 5 minutes. Why does it take 25+ years for EMI to release a half decent compilation of this great and now missed artist?
B000002BBY|5.0|Is it fair to use the word PERFECT to describe this album? Absolutely. Oasis's second studio album puts to rest any sophomore slump superstitions. This is one of those albums that just sends shivers down your spine and gives you goosebumps just by looking at the cover. It was an instant classic before I was two songs into the record. Every song on the album is worthy of being a single, which is incredibly rare to see. Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, and Champagne Supernova will go down as three of the greatest songs of all time, let alone this album. But there are other classics that CANNOT go unheard. Hey Now, Some Might Say, and the title track (What's the Story?) Morning Glory transform this album from a good album with great singles into a classic pure masterpiece from start to finish. <BR>Liam Gallagher's soaring one in a million voice combined with the musical genius of big brother Noel Gallagher makes this album better than any album I have ever heard, or ever will hear, in my entire life.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Many fans are very disappointed with this album. This is an example of the emporer without his clothes. Without the dressing the beatles really are naked. They composed some nice tunes, but the singing here is terrible.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|I thought this album was pretty good.  Godsmack seems to grow with every album, and isn't that what you would expect from a maturing rock band?  STRAIGHT OUT OF LINE, I STAND ALONE, and SINCERITY are great hits....and the rest of the album follows suit.  Not to mention, the lead singer is quite nice to look at!  :)  Anyway, this one is good....so go ahead and give it a try.  If you like AIC or any of the alternative bands from the '90s, you'll be able to appreciate this.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I think so highly of this band I don't really know if there are any words to describe this band or any of their albums.  After listening to their first album I was hooked. and after not hearing much news from them for awhile i was wondering if they would ever return...thank god they did, and they came back better than ever!  The very first time listening to &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; i was left in awe, the musicianship is very admirable and inspiring.  APC is not only good on album either, they are even more amazing live.  Every single note of every song sent chills up and down my spine, I even shed a tear! yeah, music can really do wonders...I listen to this album religiously as well as their first album &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;. So if you dont have either and you are a fan of music that has a meaning, I suggest you buy both ASAP!! You won't be let down.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Chester and the boys are back with this new album of hits...and a few misses.  The songs, lyrically, are really good...full of angst just as you would expect from Linkin Park.  However, the problem is that they all harken back to the HYBRID THEORY days.  It seems as if LP were struggling to break free of the rock-rap genre that created them.  I actually consider this more of a transitory album than anything else.  I think that LP have a long life ahead of them, but they desperately need to get away from a genre that is becoming a thing of the past and re-create their sound into something new.  I am really looking forward to hearing from them for a long time to come.  The hits on the radio are great standouts here.....
B0000VCZKM|1.0|Fantastic film, but the existing version is much better even w/o<BR>the lovely DTS. It's all about the widescreen factor- In this day<BR>and age the average film airhead obviously will still settle for Pan &amp; scan for Columbia to release this 2MPH edition. Clueless mothers probably still complaining about &quot;THOSE DARNED BLACK BARS THAT CUT OFF THE TOP AND BOTTOM.&quot; Not even so much as digging around the vaults to find an outtake or gag reel? Could've used the original poster for the sleeve! Better <BR>bring a book for this release...
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Seriously, if you dont own this album, what in gods name are you waiting for?  This man is by far one of the most talented people in music today, without any shadow of a doubt.  His lyrics are inspiring, his voice is incredibly real, and his songs are extremely different.  This album is quite possibly the best album I own, and I have more CDs then I can count.  There is not a bad song on this record, buy it I think you will enjoy it.  If you are in need of more Gavin Degraw, I suggest you try and find a copy of his cover of Phil Collins' Against All Odds, which is an amazing cover.
B000002UAO|5.0|One of the desert island albums (along with Abbey Road) that keeps giving.  Been listening to this one since high school and can't get enough.  The Beatles break out the acoustic guitars and take it easy nearly all the way through.
1556154844|5.0|This is a true must have. This is a true must read. It is already quite old but still fresh and up to date to our everyday problems.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|This album is absolutely fablous.  It showcases the best of Michael's work in the eighties, nineties, and 21st century.  Every single song is great and expresses the true genius of this extremely talented and intelligent man.  Furthermore, the songs &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Earth Song&quot; show the humanitarian side of this wonderful human being that those of us that have been his devoted fans for years have known about for a long time.  Also, for all you eighties kids out there these songs just might remind you of a simpler time (I know it does for me).  Now, there has been some confusion about the track listing because only the first 13 songs were number one hits in the U.S., however &quot;Earth Song&quot; was number one in the U.K., &quot;You Rock My World&quot; was number one in France, and &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; was number one somewhere, I think it was Australia.  For some reason Americans seem to think that their charts (and perhaps the charts of Britain) are the only ones that matter.  Whether these songs are number one or not is irrelevant though (except for the title) because these are his absolute best songs musically and lyrically.  Furthermore, the new song &quot;One More Chance&quot; is wonderful and I truly believe that it could have been yet another number one if people would not let the recent media circus cloud their judgement.  This is a genius, megastar at his very best and I highly recommend it to any music fan or music collector.  This is definitely a must have for any collector.  Here's to hoping there is going to be much more amazing music from this fabulous musician!  Long Live Michael Jackson!!!!
020161622X|4.0|I really did like the book. It is an excellent book, a treasure chest of advice and excellent references to more reading. You can use it for reference and read it in almost any order and at any kinds of intervals.<BR>But the field of general programming advice is so well equipped with excellent books that I can (unfortunately) only give four stars.
B000053VAZ|5.0|&quot;Benny and Joon&quot; is the moving story of Benny (Aidan Quinn) and Joon (Mary Stuart Mastersen) Pearl, a brother and sister who have lived together for twelve years since their parents died.  Joon suffers from mental illness, though throughout the movie there are scenes where she is profoundly sane.  <BR>Perhaps the most moving and surprising performance is Johnny Depp, whose dyslexic and extremely talented Sam brings light to Benny and Joon's sad life.  Depp is amazing as he performs his Charlie Chaplinesque slapstick, eyes twinkling.  But what makes his character even more enduring is that he loves Joon no matter how sick she may be.  He wants her to get better and be free from the watchful eye of her over-protective brother.  <br />Depp's Sam proves that laughter is the best medicine.  Watching this film will make you fall in love (or in my case, more in love!) with Johnny and it is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys pure romantic comedy at its lovliest.

B00005ND42|5.0|While I don't have the wealth of musical experience as some of the other reviewers, and while my reasons for buting this disc, as opposed to others (it was the cheapest complete set), I am very please with what I got.  The entire disc sounds right.  It is in balance.  <br />More generally, some discs make a hash of the notes, choosing to &quot;inturpret&quot; the pace.  This does not, it flows at a constant pace.<br />At the very least, give it a sample listen and compare.

0375432302|5.0|I'm not one for reading many different authors. I usually only read books by John Grisham, but I received The Da Vinci Code for Christmas. The book captures your attention right from the start. The story line is great and it really makes you think. Unlike what others say, the book kept my attention the whole time, I literally couldn't put the book down. I spent an 11 hour marathon reading the book to it's end just to find out what happens. After the book I found myself researching the topic and joining online groups about the subjects listed in the story line.
B00006AW2P|4.0|I've been listening to this record off and on for over 30 years now. However it is only recently that I have come to the conclusion that in order to deconstruct The Rolling Stones you have to start with the early recordings. What you realize is that this band has always been about and will always be about Mick Jagger. Mind you, personally Keith is my man, but in watching the recent &quot;40 Licks&quot; tour and in listening to these early recordings it becomes abundantly clear that it's all about Mick. It's Mick certainly who carries the band on the early recordings in which the vocals are the strongest aspect of the music. On &quot;Hitmakers&quot; I am continually blown away by the strength of Jagger's vocals on songs like &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, &quot;I Just Want To Make Love To You&quot;, &quot;Honest I Do&quot;, &quot;Can I Get A Witness&quot;, and &quot;You Can Make It If You Try&quot;. This doesn't sound like an skinny pasty faced 18 year old English kid, this sounds like an R &amp; B veteran who drinks and smokes too much and is on his third wife! Yeah the music is great on the aforementioned titles as well as &quot;Route 66&quot; &amp; &quot;Carol&quot;, and Brian does play some amazing harp. Remember this is way before Keith became known as the riff-meister general, and before Charlie &amp; Bill solidified into the greatest rhythm section in the business. Why not 5 stars? Well &quot;Now I've Got A Witness&quot; and &quot;Tell Me&quot; (the first Jagger/Richard composition to appear on a Stones recording) are interesting, but off the mark. Having said that it's still a &quot;must have&quot; recording for any Rolling Stones fan.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's, The Da Vinci Code, is great fun, a real page turner and, in the course being entertaining it stimulates the reader to investigate a number of subjects that he might never have considered.  Lighten-up, all of you literary critics, Dan Brown isn't Tolstoy, Proust, or Dickens; and I don't think he intends to be. Compare him with Ludlum, Cussler, or maybe better yet, Irving Wallace; remember The Word?<br />  So have fun, spend a week-end curled up with this book, and if it stimulates your interest in Leonardo, Templar Knights, or the Holy Grail so be it. If Harry Potter, can get kids to read again, maybe Da Vinci can do the same for adults.

B00005JLYW|1.0|I have to say that this movie is the worst piece of crap ever made. Bad acting, an extremely stupid story, and ridiculous special effects.

B00013F35I|4.0|I've listened to this DVD all the way through.<br />Cons:<br />The sound quality is not the best.  It sounds like it was recorded off of concert-hall mikes rather than directly from the soundboard.  There were a couple of songs that were mixed oddly.  For example, Dancing in the Dark had too much of the drums and keyboards up front and they overshadowed Bruce's vocals.  The Dolby 5.1 Surround is good, as is the PCM (?) which sounded better than the Dolby on my setup.  I would have liked to have seen a few more far-away shots of the band and fewer tight shots of just Bruce's head.  Lastly, there's hardly any extras on the DVD, just the &quot;Drop the needle and pray&quot; fluff piece about the tour.  I would have liked to have seen more on the backstage goings-on, the setlist creation, and so forth.<br />Pros:<br />Bruce and the band really threw themselves into this show.  The audience clearly was into it, too, which makes for a great show.  The setlist choices were fantastic, a real variety.  Ramrod was the best I've ever seen, and there were a few uncommon setlist choices thrown in.  Spirit in the Night (he forgets the words!) and Incident were both solo Bruce at the piano.  These were excellent renditions and I'd never heard them solo before.  These alone make the disc worth owning.<br />All in all, Bruce and the band's performance will have you jumping off of your sofa while watching this.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Yes it's bizzare,yes it has cheesy sets and costumes and YES<BR>it stars Michael Work and Farrah Fawcett but I DON&quot;T want to see<BR>some really untalented modern day hack director come along and turn this classic into a needlessly dark,grungy Generation X <BR>sci-fi flick!&quot;Logan's Run&quot; thin veneer of cheese gives it it's charm-the movie IS very well constructed and the plot is brilliant!It's message-that paradise may no be where or what one thinks is something people in this modern age should take to heart.And I actually LIKE the slightly homoerotic feel of the first half of the film.And the special effects were good in their time (unless you call todays already corny computer animation a brilliant move).Not to make a pun but for classic science fiction fans this is a movie to run to but PLEASE MODERN-DAY HOLLYWOOD;DON'T SCREW THIS UP WITH REMAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008NG5V|2.0|Yep, he's mellow, and he surfs, and he's got some hints of reggae, and he wears sandals and plays an acoustic guitar. If those are your qualifications for a good album, buy this one. If you're looking for something creative and groundbreaking, an album with innovative, interesting music, look somewhere else. Jack Johnson is predictable at best, downright boring at worst.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the zone is  Britney's hottest album to date. She sounds more mature and as a fantastic voice. The songs are amaging and are not full of pop music as her previuos albums. Buy this album, it is the bomb. You'll never regret buying it.
B00008NRI8|1.0|Although the sound went out several times during the movie and we were all given a free ticket to come back to see it, nothing made me want to see it. I thought Sandra and Hugh showed no chemistry what-so-ever. They were not realistic as a couple and I didn't like either one's characters. I went to see it thinking, \\"How can a Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock movie be bad.\\" Well, they answered it for me. I could of thought of a million things better to do with my time. I will flip the channel when I see it on cable.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Far too short a run on TV, but at least the DVD is now available with three (count 'em, three) unaired episodes. And they are wonderful, particularly three of them. The last one I watched made me scream that the show had been canceled. And here's a quick prayer for the hoped-for movie. <br />Fans of the show will love this DVD, especially being able to view the shows in the order Whedon would have liked. The behind-the-scenes featurettes really show how much the show meant to the cast and crew. In fact, I'd recommend viewing at least one of those before beginning the series if you're new to Firefly. The gag reel is fun, especially the ending(!). <br />For those new to Firefly, yes, even these few episodes are worth watching. This was a show aired by those who did not understand it, and TV land is sorrier for its loss. The characters and their situations and interactions are engaging. The ensemble cast excels at making the viewer immediately care about these people. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this show; in fact, fans of westerns may like it just as much. Watch at least 2-3 episodes; give yourself a chance to catch on to the show's unique qualities. It's a gem.<br />This may have been my best present this year.
6300182355|5.0|This movie of 1980 is a definite classic and has 5-STARS written all over it. The effects are excellent, the costumes are great and the screenplay is outstanding and don't forget the phenomenal soundtrack provided by Queen. The actors in this movie did an excellent job of making the comic book come to the big screens. Sam J. Jones played the famous and everlasting Flash Gordon and did a great job and he definately deserves a round of applause.<br />The movie starts out in space and you see the evil Emporer Ming (Max von Sydow) causing all kinds of weather mishaps to occur such as Hot Hail, Typhoon, Hurricane, Earthquakes, etc. Then you hear Ming's right hand man Klytus (Peter Wyngarde) asking the Ming, &quot;Will you destroy this earth?&quot; Ming says evily, &quot;Later. I like to play with things awhile....BEFORE ANNIHILATION! Ha, Ha, Ha!&quot; That right there tells what the movie is going to be about.<br />Now we go down to Earth and meet Flash (Jones) at the Airport waiting for his plane to arrive and joining him in the flight is lovely travel agent Dale Arden (Melody Anderson). When they go into flight, Ming starts causing more mayhem on earth. He starts an evil eclipse of some sort and then we meet Dr. Hans Zarkov (Topol), a former NASA scientist who has been claiming there will be an attack on the earth and now he realizes it's coming. So while Flash and Dale are still in the air in the middle of this eclipse, the pilots dissapear and now Flash and Dale land the plane right at Zarkov's house. So the three of them go into space in Zarkov's rocketship and land on the planet Mongo.<br />Now all three of them meet the evil Emporer Ming and Flash now realizes he has to stop him and save the Earth. So as the movie goes by, Flash gets the people of Mongo to team-up with him and overthrow Ming and kill him. The people that team up with him are Prince Barin (Timothy Dalton) and Prince Vultan (Brian Blessed) and his Hawkmen. So together they all start to take over by defeating the Imperial Fleet on the rocket Ajax. Now Flash flies the plane straight into Ming's palace and ends us killing him. The way he kills him is interesting.<br />This is the perfect movies for anyone he likes space movies. The storyline is great and the special effects are outstanding, especially for 1980 before the computers came out. The movie is a must buy. LONG LIVE FLASH!defeating the Imperial Fleet on the rocket Ajax. Now Flash flies the plane straight into Ming's palace and ends us killing him.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|Loved the movie -- but then, with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine..... <br />Plenty of action, some exciting fight sequences, much more characterization than the first one. The Cerebus scenes got a little old, but most of the movie was excellent. The DVD has some excellent extras, especially regarding &quot;the making of.&quot; As is often the case with deleted scenes, few add anything of interest to the movie itself. Other extra footage was lengthy, informative, and interesting.<br />And then, there's Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.... and in the extras, Hugh Jackman as Hugh Jackman.
B000069CWE|5.0|OK, I see LP fans doggin' the cd...I'm not sure what that's all about.  I've been a huge hip hop head for years...and have made a living being a radio personality playing this music...I'm personally am a major fan of concious/progressive/underground hip hop....and have been for years.  Zion I, Kutmasta Kurt (a personal friend), Pharoahe Monch, and even that madman Phoenix Orion all hold regular places in my cd rotation.  I was the skeptical one here about sell outs...I thought all my vinyl favs had sold out to link up with some crazy pop nu-metal band that was all over the radio for their own advancement...and in some ways, I was right.  But WHO CARES!<br />This cd is fantastic, especially from the ears of someone who doesn't really like much hard rock...let alone any rock.  I now LOVE linkin park, and it was all because this cd opened my ears to their music and their subject matter.  I don't think I've heard many songs as poignent as Ppr:Kut....listen to your inner voice man...dope.<br />Since being turned onto them, I've also become a huge fan of System of a Down and Mushroomhead and Tool...etc...all because my favorite rappers hooked up with a nu-metal band to put together a rockin' masterpiece.<br />Anyways...just my two cents.
B00005JMGL|2.0|This take on the familiar fairy tale is somewhat interesting for its subversive, sexualized treatment of the main characters.  What was subtext is essentially made text here as the film focuses less on the Romantic idealization of childhood (the raison d'etre both of the original book and previous filmic incarnations) than on the burgeoning bodily passions of early adolescence, and how these passions affect our relations to the two social groups we're caught between in this stage of human development, children and adults.  Thus the Peter Pan character, given the majority of the attention (and the hero's treatment) in previous incarnations of the story, plays second fiddle here to Wendy.  <br /> Pan here retains from previous versions of the story that vigor born out of pure youthful capriciousness, though the filmmakers here have chosen to treat this condition as a malady--a particularly debilitating psychosis that is given an added tragic dimension by the fact that Pan mistakes this flaw for virtue.   Totally oblivious to the intellectual and emotional confinement produced by his condition, Pan is shown to be a rather pathetic and ultimately damned creature, dead to an entire world of human experience because of his naive resentment of something he does not know--adulthood.  In this sense the character is an embodiment of all of our own unfounded prejudices and myopic ideals.  This works both for and against the film.  Intellectually the approach is interesting, but it also causes us a certain discomfort and disappointment, effectively building a wall between the audience and the character as our expectations of him are willfully confounded, thus throwing us into a void where we essentially spend the remainder of the movie grasping blindly in an attempt to regain a sense of who this character is, and failing because here Pan is essentially an intellectual construct or category rather than a character with a specific arc.  In previous versions of the story Pan's final battle with Captain Hook served as a satisfying resolution to the former's conventional hero-arc.  And although this final battle is in Hogan's film as well, it feels curiously devoid of urgency, danger and, in the end, catharsis.  Because Pan is not a hero in this film and, as critic Dave Edelstein points out, Hook is not so much a villain as a kind of playmate, Pan's eventual triumph is moot.  The rivalry between Hook and Pan is not so much about the rivalry between good and evil.   Rather it's the dutiful performance of one's role that is valued in this rivalry, as if each character's decision to go through the conventional narrative motions was the cause of the rivalry itself, the means serving a comfortable dual role as both themselves and the end.  No motivation, no movement,  just a vapid theatricality substituting for meaning.  This inherent stagnancy in the characters is neither helped by the vacant stare and charisma-challenged line readings of the boy playing Pan, nor the generic-villain malevolence displayed by the man playing Hook.  The young boy is, however, good looking enough to convincingly play the object of a young adolescent girl's lust, which works well for the development of the film's real protagonist, Wendy. <br /> The actress playing Wendy, with her sinful mouth playing in marked distinction to her girlish demeanor (something that is remarked upon repeatedly in the film), is very good at conveying the initial throws of womanhood and all the self-conscious anxiety that that brings on.  The key event early in the film occurs when Wendy's aunt calls the girl in front of the family and tells them that the girls full lips reveal that she'll be a woman soon.  This uncomfortable confrontation with familial authority is undoubtedly the first time the girl becomes aware of  her sexuality as such, providing the impetus for her decision--an act of psychosexual avoidance and repression--to go with Pan (along with her brothers, who are just in it forboyish thrills) to Neverland.  While there the blond-haired, blue-eyed, perpetually bare-chested Pan becomes, in contradiction to her conscious intentions, a further provocation to her pubescent sexuality.  Indeed this whole adolescent psychosexual motif is brought further into light when we consider the fact that the film is infused with so much nocturnal and dream imagery.  Wendy is swept away at night by a flying, young Nordic god, taken through a universe of popup-book planets, stars and moons, and lands in Neverland on a fluffy pink cloud.  At the conclusion of her fantasy, after being given her first kiss, she returns to her parents at night, leaving her young would-be lover and his forever-stunted growth behind.  Freudian cultural critics should at least get a good chuckle from all of this blatant eroticism in what is ostensibly just a corporate funded family film. <br />  This story of a girl's passage from childhood to adolescence is not really as interesting as it should be though.  There are not enough instances of character development to fully sustain interest in the narrative.  Too often we are given dull action sequences and pointless, meandering side stories (e.g. the capture of Wendy's little brothers).  The society of the Lost Boys, an aspect of the story that is crucial, as it  gives Pan's character a broader socio-political context (illuminating the hierarchical structure of Neverland's supposedly anarchic rejection of authority and adult values), is given short shrift here.   And while director Hogan's compositions have lots to look at, they lack the tactile authority of reality that a much simpler approach can often achieve with ease.  Like so much of contemporary visual media, the film's language belongs to the hyperreality of television commercials and music videos.  Which wouldn't be such a problem if this omnipresent aesthetic was balanced by more traditionally photographed scenes of character interaction.  Unfortunately the director's inability to create a palpable reality (which would require the ability to move beyond the decontextualized aesthetic vacuum of postmodern visual arts) results in a movie experience more akin to a sugar high than to an experience of authentic cinema.  The pretty colors and snazzy effects are interesting for a little while, but quickly become anesthetizing in the absence of Hogan's restraint.  The film is more glossy than polished, more pretty than beautiful, which leaves us, rather disappointingly, with something that is more interesting to discuss afterwards than to actually watch.
630514415X|1.0|Spike Lee, like The-Man-Dumb-Enough-to-marry-Madonna (er Guy Ritchie), and Kevin Smith, had one good beginning movie (Do The Right Thing for Lee) which, though far from a masterpiece, showed excellent promise. And like his aforementioned overrated peers (with Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels and Clerks, respectively), he has spent the rest of his sad career trying recapture this lightning in a bottle, in the form of worse and worse rehashes of old characters from the previous films,  and preaching his political/social theory-- like the message of this film, which is &quot;money makes evil&quot;. Insightful, dummy.<BR>   <br />This is Lee's homage to uptown basketball, where (GASP!) there is corruption afoot. Wow. Thanks for the info, Captain obvious. Tell me, is alcoholism bad too?<BR>     <br />Denzel Washington pulls off the &quot;misunderstood angry black man&quot; role he does in every film written for him (to see him not rely on this and actually show chops, see The Hunt For Red October or Fallen), and Ray Allen proves for the umpteenth time why sports stars/ musicians should not act, especially those who can't read. Honestly, Lee couldn't find an actor with chops to read this role, instead of mumbling like a fool like Allen does?<BR>   <br />Lee interjects the film with countless shots of women naked, trying desperately to deflect your view from the crappy script and shoddy character development. It doesn't even work the first time, which is sad, considering he hires porn stars. Poor Spike. he had such promise. Then again, I'm sure Joel Schumacher did once too.<BR>   <br />If you liked this movie, chances are you probably believe in vast conspiracies involving everyone but you. This movie's about as well put together as an NBA basketball game.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|I was taking a look at the special features and came across a couple of things that had me cringing in a 'so bad it's good' kinda way. 'Harve Bennett's Pitch' was just bizarre (I think this was made for the sales and promotion people at Paramount). He gives the Vulcan 'live long and prosper' salute and explains the meaning behind it (whether it's true or not I have no idea), saying that if you adopt the hand gesture that you cannot lie (never heard that one before!). He then goes on to say how great the film is and how proud he is of it while doing the v sign with not just one but both hands. Weird. Then we have the press conference. Harve Bennett starts things off trying to be amusing but is greeted with silence from the gathered press. William Shatner then goes on to introduce the regular cast who are all in costume and seem embarrassed as they quote rehearsed lines after Shatner hands the mic (briefly) to them. He then forgets Walter (Chekov) Koenig's  name, introducing him as a colleague. Koenig, looking quite insulted, quickly takes the mic from Shatner and states his name.<br />We also get to see the Rockman costume that wasn't used in the film. It apparently cost thousands of dollars to make and looks like something that you'd see in an old episode of Lost In Space or Doctor Who. It's just as well Shatner was told that the budget wasn't large enough to make more of these costumes!<br />As for the film itself, it has its moments and the photography is terrific...but the comedic moments are mostly cringe-inducing. Scotty's \\"I know this ship like the back of my hand\\" scene is awful and an insult to the character; the camping scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy are forced and mostly silly; Chekov and Sulu getting lost in the woods is another insult to two great characters; and Uhura doing her fan dance is just jaw-droppingly stupid. It's a shame that the regular supporting characters are made to look foolish in the name of \\"comedy\\". Nimoy and his writers did a terrific job in the previous films giving the Enterprise crew funny moments without cheapening the characters, and it's a shame that Shatner didn't do the same here. It's no wonder that actors like Doohan, Koenig, Takei and Nichols were so bitter about Shatner for years.
0156027321|1.0|After reading this book I felt even more sorry for the author than for losing my time. He delivers a lengthy intro with end- and pointless blubbering about religions, coming to true but trivial conlusions. He fills the pages with uninteresting and sometimes plainly wrong &quot;facts&quot; about zoo life and animal behaviour. He steals ideas from other authors (e.g. the carnivorous island is taken from &quot;Bluebear&quot; by W. Moers) and poorly adapts them to his story. The ending is inconclusive and takes a disturbing, non-functional twist. The fantastic odyssee the story has the potential to be is bluntly destroyed by all the pseudo-scientific explanations the author gives to make it &quot;believable&quot;. The book made the impression to me as if it was written by an absolute beginner. Nothing new here, just old-fart modules clumsily clumped together into an unremarkable patchwork of old and stolen ideas. <br />What I liked most about the book was the cover picture. I recommend to just look at that picture and fantasize your own story. You will come up with something more interesting and enchanting than what you would read in the book. It is very sad to see how somebody can turn a promising idea into such a sorry piece of literature. For a truly fantastic adventure story, I recommend Walter Moers's &quot;Bluebear&quot;.
0743455967|1.0|I bought this book on the strength of the excerpt published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; about King's injury by a lunatic-driven van in 1999 while taking a walk in Maine. That essay was quite good, and a steal for the price of the magazine. It's added on at the end of &quot;On Writing&quot;, as a sort of PS. That it wasn't integrated into the work as a whole shows me, at least, that neither King or his editor really cared about this book in the first place.<br />This book is a crude, banal, meandering, self-absorbed effort--to call it a work is too kind--that isn't worth the 7.99 I dished out for it. I am not a fan of King's, I admit, though I remember reading &quot;Carrie&quot; and really liking it--in high school. Still, I like all kinds of music, movies, and books, and was really looking forward to hearing some interesting insights on the craft. Something like John Gardner's &quot;On the Art of Fiction&quot;. Well, forget it, that's not here. Yes, the stuff about how he sold &quot;Carrie&quot; and lifted himself out of poverty is interesting, and at times, very funny. But that's it. Take &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, reduce its insights into writing by 2/3's, and add plenty of fart jokes, moronic stereotypes about religion, strained and boring metaphors and analogies about writing, and presto, you have this, er, book. Sorry, Steve, it just ain't worth two Extra Value Meals at McDonald's, and that's the truth.
1570429596|4.0|As long as this philosophy makes it to the best seller list every so often, we're doing okay. The abridged tape version is an ideal 3-hour inspiration check. The message is as simple as it is timeless and dates back at least through the popular literature of Ragged Dick and Horatio Alger 150 years ago. Just stick it into the tape deck and get reacquainted with the way the real world operates. Just wish Rich Dad had mentioned as much about entrepreneurs \\"creating\\" assets as buying assets.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is the movie that started it all, it's Walt Disney's animated crowning achievement. It's a collection of stories composed with the classic music of Beethoven to Shubert all with the help of Leon Kopolsky.<br />A stunning and beautiful animated movie that is the first of it's kind to be like a concert feature using beautiful animation, well designed characters, some hot centaurettes for the guys, Mickey Mouse made famous on his &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentience&quot; short and it's a visual movie for the senses.<br />Highly recommended!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I get so bored with the same old Vampires and Werewolves stories that I don't even go to see those kind of movies anymore.  However, when I saw the preview of Underworld, I was excited.  Finally, a movie that is fresh and different.  When they said it was a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" story, they were correct.  Lucien and Viktor's daughter were the Romeo and the Juliet.  Seline's and Michael'a blossoming romance will make a great sequel.  I enjoyed the Matrix, the Crow and Blade, so this movie will be added to that growing list.  The artistry of this movie was fantastic.  I didn't want this movie to end.  When is the Sequel?
B00015HVI8|5.0|For some reason, each season of StarGate, IMO, gets better as a lateral, one being my least favorite, up on and so forth getting better. Season six was no exception. The opening three episodes were some of the best in the series, and the finale was nothing short of amazing. The addition of Jonas' character was great as a team member, and further plot lines in the show itself grew. Finally some results from the shows original main premise, aquiring technology to fight the Goa'uld, is shown in the F-302 and F-303.<br />The story of the Asguard vs. Replicators comes to an end, and at the end of the season, we get a new sense of direction for the plot of season seven. And as for season seven, while some of its episodes are mediocre, most of the newer ones are awesome(like Grace and Evolution part II), and the finale is going to be like watching a theatrical movie, becuase that is what it was intended to be.<br />The DVD looks great, plenty of these \\"Directors\\" featurettes, whatever they are, and audio commentary on each episode. Widescreen is still looking good also.
B00004W50T|5.0|A friend of mine gave me a tape of this album on a rainy day, back in 1989, just before I took a 6 hour ride on a Greyhound bus across Virginia.  I'd heard The Basement Tapes before, but not this album.  I put it on, settled into my headphones, listened to it, looked out the window and played it over and over and over for the entire ride. <br />It's the perfect soundtrack for looking out a window watching backroads go by.  Over the years, I've grown to enjoy the grooves of their second album more, but this one is trickier and more textural, like a strange friend that you like but only hang out with occasionally.  It's also excellent music but far better spokespeople than me have already made that clear.
0553103547|1.0|George R.R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, of which the Game of Thrones is the first of a projected seven volumes (the fourth of which is due to be published in mid-2004), is the most overrated fantasy series of the day.  The poor writing and the lack of likeable or believable characters combine to create an unworkable mess.<br />Martin's show-biz mind comes up with numerous ludicrous moments.  His \\"heroes\\" are impossible to take seriously because they keep doing impossibly dumb things such as putting themselves and their families into the hands of their enemies.  His \\"villains\\" are impossible to take seriously because they are incapable of successfully assassinating a middle aged woman, or, for that matter, a young child.<br />(The fact that Martin's characters are generally trying to commit such deeds makes for extremely unpleasant as well as frustrating reading).<br />The scare quotes two paragraphs above indicate the moral ambiguity of Martin's universe.  He does not really believe in heroism or villainy, which makes for an extremely blah story.  Granted that two-shaded, black or white storytelling is _almost_ as mindless as writing gets, Martin still does not improve on this.  He actually falls short of even that low standard.  His one shade of gray in the middle for everybody is even more mindless.  It also creates a story that is inherently uninteresting - why should the reader care who \\"wins\\" when one character is as good/bad as another?<br />Like horror movie protagonists, Martin's characters are often defenestrated, throat-slashed, thrown into the river, or set on fire - yet they just keep coming.  The extremely graphic violence would be less unbearable if it weren't all so ineffective.<br />The motivations and actions of the characters are completely unbelievable.  How much familial loyalty would a real man have left if his father had the young man's girlfriend raped by an entire company of soldiers (including the young man's brother) because she was unworthy of their family?  That Martin revels in such moments is bad enough.  That his characters' responses to them are so flat goes far beyond the bounds of credibility.  Fantasy setting or not, people are simply not like this.  No author who understands human nature so little can have much of interest to say.<br />Martin believes that he has single-handedly discovered a major flaw common to almost all other writers:  that their major characters inevitably survive to the end (or close to the end) of the production.  He does not understand that he is putting the cart before the horse, and so missing the point entirely.  Of course other authors have \\"mortal\\" characters.  However, other authors are simply intelligent enough to realize that the major characters of a work (or a real-life episode) are generally to be found among those who are alive for a significant part of it, and to construct their storytelling accordingly.  By repeatedly focusing on characters who shortly thereafter meet their demises, Martin succeeds only in punishing his readers with a series of unproductive false starts.<br />Martin's writing is similar in many ways to that of another very flawed writer, one whose many faults are more widely recognized:  Terry Goodkind.  Martin shares Goodkind's penchant for violence and sex, though Martin's versions are even more graphic and unappealing (he does, fortunately, lack Goodkind's particular brand of sappy smarminess).  Nevertheless, the comparison ultimately favors Goodkind because he can at least wrap a story up, something Martin, like Robert Jordan, is incapable of doing.  Goodkind is under the disadvantage of having published eight books with which to annoy readers, as opposed to Martin's three (in this series).<br />To compare Martin to Tolkien, or to Herbert or Donaldson, is to lose all credibility.  Donaldson at his 25 year-old, strained-vocabulary worst was infinitely the better writer.  Thrones and its successors should be avoided at allcosts.  Instead, go with Tad Williams, Michael Scott Rohan, Jack Vance, or early Raymond Feist.costs.  Instead, go with Tad Williams, Michael Scott Rohan, Jack Vance, or early Raymond Feist.
B000067J1Y|5.0|First off, Valerie Golino is so beautiful. I mean how can you not fall in love with her at first site? What she does with her belly button and grape is nothing short of amazing.<br />That said, this movie is hilarious. I hate the movie Top Gun, and can't stand Tom Cruise. It was a joy for me to see one of my favorite actors, Charlie Sheen, taking 'Hot Shots' at Cruise and his lame movie.<br />Also Lloyd Bridges steals every scene he's in. He made the movie as funny as it was. The guy had a wound from every battle in the last 50 years and had an artificial body part to prove it.<br />In the tradition of Naked Gun and Airplane! You have to also see the two Hot Shots movies. Part 2 is just as funny as 1.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is the epitome of great television.  When it was on and now that I have the DVD set it truly is my serenity, my sanctuary from the heinous abomination that is taking over the air waves; i.e. reality tv. Thank you Joss Whedon and everyone who helped make this show possible and never give up the dream.<BR>Keep flyin!
0345350499|5.0|This is the familiar story of Arthur and Camelot but as told by the women of the story, Arthur's mother, his wife and others but mostly his half-sister Morgaine.  The main conflict of the story is not Knights vs Saxons as is often the main theme of this story but instead the clash of cultures as the older Goddess centered religion of the Celts is pushed aside by Christianity.  Neither faith is presented as 'right' or better but each is shown to have flaws.  The characters are drawn not as heroes or villians but as real people with both good and bad qualities.<br />The descriptions in the book are so detailed and well done that it is possible to visualize each person, each setting as if pictures had been provided.  <br />As exacting as the descriptions are the ending is frustrating.  The story ends as it must, with the ruin of Camelot.  The frustration comes from the realization that each character acted in the way they had felt was right and true to their beliefs but that had lead all to pain and ruin in the end.     <br />I read this book when it first came out and loved it then, when I saw that it was being made into a film I read it again then saw the film.  I have just finished my third time through the book.  Each time I have gotten something more from the story.  My reactions have ranged from pride in the strength of women, contempt for narrow mindedness, frustration that the characters all seemed doomed to their fates to name a few.  This latest reading has left me with a quote from Morgaine \\"I have called on the Goddess and found her within myself.\\"
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Don't let my title mislead you.  Wicked is not my favorite musical, to say so would be ludicrous; however, the production quality of the live show was absolutely stunning.  A fan of live theater in all forms, I know quality... and this show surpasses all standard.   <br />As far as the soundtrack is concerned, I am highly impressed by Schwarz' lyrics and tone.  The music and lyrics are witty and stylish, with just enough shtick to please even the most cynical of characters.  Not a fan of Schwarz' other musicals, I am pleasantly surprised and hope to see more like this out of him in the years to come.  Broadway veteran Joel Grey is very disappointing as the Wizard.  He simply doesn't have the bravado or power to make the part as big as it should be.  Which is a shame.  I might have enjoyed his two tracks much more if someone else was singing the part.  <br />The most notable tracks are indefinetly &quot;No Good Deed Goes Unpunished&quot; and &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot;...  The music is not exceptionally brilliant, but fun enough that you'll find yourself humming the tunes over and over again until you know every lyric.  <br />Bottom line:  Get Wicked.  No regrets.  And if you're in New York:  See Wicked.  It's worth every cent.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is such an awesome DVD. Britney puts on the best show ever. The ending is &quot;THE BEST&quot; Any Britney Spears fan should own this DVD. 5 stars!
B000002GQE|5.0|I have a very special place in my heart for this album as I performed selections from Days of Future Passed with the Toledo Glassmen in 1994. I purchased a cassette of the album (I didn't have a CD player yet, being only 19 at the time) and fell in love with the music immediately.  The album was ahead of it's time back in 1967 and literally establish the Moody Blues in the music world.  It was also one of the first rock concept albums released and the forerunner of many more.<br />The concept itself is simple, that of following a day from morning to night.  There is a very palindromic design to the album with a crescendoing gong and poem at the beginning, then another poem and a decrescendoing gong at the end, just like the sun rises and sets with each day.  The arrangement of the album is very complex and intertwined with orchestral interludes blending together with the group's own songs.  While the album had two hit singles (Tuesday Afternoon, Nights in White Satin), every song is strong (my personal favorites are Peak Hour and Twilight Time).  While the performance of the London Festival Orchestra isn't up to the standards of the LSO (they were the studio orchestra for Deram, the recording label, and therefore cheap for the Moody Blues to use), they do an more than adequate job of conveying the different moods of the day.  Considering that this album was originally a demonstration of Deram's &quot;Deramic Sound System&quot; and was never expected to be a hit of any kind, it's all the more amazing that it became the springboard for the Moody Blues' career.
B0000C16OQ|4.0|\\"Grease\\" was a huge success as a Broadway musical prior and after hitting the big screen in 1978. The movie version was the one that transformed it into a true popular culture phenomenon, as it was a runaway box office success and then became a TV, cable, video DVD favorite. The movie was even re-released a few years ago. The movie owes as much of the success to this infectious soundtrack as it does to the charming performances of a cast led by John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, and Stockard (\\"There At Worse Things I Could Do\\") Channing, who put together  charismatic and engaging performances, that make you smile and be part of the gang.<br />Most of the music from original musical (\\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" among others) made it to the movie and soundtrack. The original songs are fortified by monster hits, such as \\"You're The One That I Want\\", \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\" and the title song, which was a huge hit for Frankie Valli. Yes Frankie Valli had a huge hit in 1978! There are few soundtracks that are as much fun as this one and I of course give it 5+ stars.<br />The huge problem that I have with this remastered (finally and it does sound great !!!!!!) \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is that, along with several other titles are gauging the consumer's eyes out with 2 CD releases that retail for up to $29.99. Out of all the ones that I've heard, this is by far the worst as the 2nd CD (which only clocks in at 40 minutes) only has ONE song worth mentioning (\\"Grease Megamix\\") which you already may have via other collections. Seeing that the Megamix had good results (and it does flow very well), the powers that be cut and paste a horrible \\"Grease Dream Mix\\" (this is beyond bad) and shameless remixes of \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"You're The One That I Want\\" that have no value whatsoever except to fill a second CD. The rest is what they call sing-a-long versions which are essential cheesy instrumentals for karaoke fans. Although the presentation of the discs is very cute, and all the lyrics are there just in the original LP, there NO updates, behind the scenes extras, or anything new. Nothing! It's pretty bad when I found out more about \\"Grease\\" in Olivia's awesome recent greatest hits release than I did here. For example did you know that \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\" was written and recorded after the movie had wrapped. It seems like the producers felt like they needed a strong ballad and her Olivia come back to an empty set to sing this amazing song.<br />If I am going to pay $29.99 or anything close, I would have expected these types of tidbits. In a nutshell, \\"Grease\\" especially now that is remastered, earns 5+ stars, but the shady folks at Universal should be ashamed not to have released this in a single CD and not to be so money hungry as \\"Grease\\" fans will pay almost anything to finally be able to hear this piece of Americana as clearly as possible. \\"Grease\\" = Stars, Universal (in this particular case) = 0. Universal has recently begun to implement a great lower pricing policy and they should be lauded for that, but if it comes at the risk of ripping off other consumers, then don't be surprised when some people burn CDs for everyone that they can. Good products (which this is) at a good price will bring people back to buying music so that the industry can continue to make a decent return in its investment., and all the lyrics are there just in the original LP, there NO updates, behind the scenes extras, or anything new.

0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring has climbed right up there on my favroite novels list. In this gem Tracy Chevalier follows Griet, a young maid in Holland in the 1660s. Her writing is smoothe and subtle. When reading it you feel as though you are touching and seeing things through Griet's eyes. What moved me the most was her description of Johannes Vermeer's art and his process of meticulous planning and painting. After reading the novel I looked up some of his paintings online and I could not draw my eyes away from them. I highly reccomend this novel for a long afternoon where one can allow themselves to be taken by the words and truely fall into the story as it unfolds.

0553573403|5.0|As the Lord of the Rings phenomenon is now winding down, and people are looking for something else to fill that void, this series will not only ease the sense of something ending, but make people pray that the era of fantasy movie-making doesn't stop with LOTR.  The cast of characters is long enough to give the general reader pause, but the story itself gives reason enough to follow your favorites, wherever they may go.  If the reader allows it (and this is not a burden to accept lightly) each book will give the emotional response of having lived through the words.  I cannot describe the feeling of surviving (or not) the treachery, barely making it through a 10,000 man battle, or playing the Game of Thrones, but I know that I have lived it, just by reading these books.  Now, everything I read merely serves to bide the time until Book 4 comes out.  And when it does, nothing else will be read until I have pored over every word more than a few times.  5 stars doesn't even begin to describe the quality and depth of this series.
B00005UKE0|5.0|What? &quot;...George Harrison has arguably become the band's most curmudgeonly cynic.&quot;  OK, I'll argue that point.  If you're considering buying this CD set (as I was a few days ago) and read the editorial review or another similar to it, you might be concerned that you'll end up with some altered travesty of the great old album that you love so much. Well, don't worry--all the original tracks are there in their original glory. And so's the original cover art, inside the booklet.  Which, if one cares to read it without preconceptually ruffled feathers, is actually quite complimentary to Phil Spector and all the artists who performed on the recording.  There's a great deal of warmth and affection in George's reminiscences.  It's quite clear from the text that this album held a special place in his heart.<br />It's an album which some fans may hold so dear that they can't conceive of any added tracks or altered packaging, or even the artist musing that he'd like to hear some of the music in a form that sounds less dated by the level of production.  He didn't say there was anything wrong with the way it was--just that as an artist, he'd like the chance to present parts of his work in alternate ways now.  It's an artist's prerogative to think such things.  And if you consider yourself too big a fan of this album as a museum piece to even remotely entertain the possibility, then I submit that you have missed the point of the title track.<br />As I say, the original songs remain *untouched* except perhaps by the purity of the digital mastering.  The added tracks were George's gift to those of his fans who might be interested in seeing how his mind worked then and now.  Though I might have been as happy without them as with, I am grateful for his thoughtfulness in giving us the choice.<br />And I really appreciate the nice way the artwork was handled. The original cover was intended as gentle humor on several levels, anyway.  (Something which I, preconditioned back then to think of George as the grimly serious Beatle, was unable to see at the time.)  The several variations presented in the new packaging are nothing more than good-natured extensions of the joke.<br />If you don't already have a CD version of this album and are considering this one, don't be dissuaded by the presence of additional tracks or art.  What you're looking for is in here, and it's just as fine as ever.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I caught it when it was out in theatres last summer and really liked it.I picked up the DVD the other day and I think it was even better this time then when I first saw it.The only thing I wish was better was the hybrid.The end result wasn't as good as I thought it'd be.But I was happy with the overall movie.
B0000VAFNQ|2.0|Okay, the premise was interesting, Vampires versus Werewolves (Lycans). But who wants to see them duke it out with GUNS??? Adding to the stupidity, the Vampires shoot silver nitrate bullets, and the Lycans shoot (I'm not joking here, folks) daylight bullets! The acting is rather hammy. The dialogue is such a waste, many times it really seems as though it is simply there to fill time. I will admit that the movie got better as it went on, and in the end, I would call it midly entertaining. Really, though, nothing more than a hybrid of The Matrix and The Crow movies. Unless you are a serious comic book geek or insatiable g*th cow, skip it.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I used to listen only Rock and Metal but lately Iam listening electronic Music and there you will find a lot of Creativity and Inovation. Many say that DT tries to make their songs mostly using their technic abilities. False I think It is a Great Album and I don't care much for technical skills as I did in the past, you would know that if you listen  bands like Shpongle or Infected Mushroom, their music it is mostly composition and production Oriented instead of Interpretation Oriented Music. This DT new album also returns to their true roots with heavy riffs and leaving behind the so used cheesy stuff, althought They might require some help in production next time, because they use very common Production techniques without any innovation making DT a band that forgot about progressionist like Pink Floyd and went only for progressive Music.!!!!

0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown has written a popular book which is a provocative and entertaining piece of FICTION.  My major concern is that many readers will accept Mr. Brown's research as 'impeccable' and will accept his major premises about 'the historical Jesus', the Knights Templar, etc. as 'truth' [a dangerous term to use in today's postmodern world].<br />If readers are encouraged to engage in further research about the controversial subjects addressed in Mr. Brown's fictional novel, then indeed Mr. Brown has provided an excellent launching point for intellectual growth.  If, however, readers accept Mr. Brown's major plot premises as factual, proven history beyond dispute, then  Mr. Brown owes his reading community an apology for inaccurate and inadequate research for his novel.<br />Hopefully, many will accept this book for what it is -- a fictional piece of literature.  In that sense, this book is entertaining and interesting.  And if it causes readers to research more about the subjects addressed, then it will have served a noble purpose.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I am normally much longer winded on this sort of thing, but I have not the effort.  This is my favorite movie I have seen and it is one done in a way to entertain even those not jaded in the drug scene.  Both sides are shown in a way that may open the mind of the judgemental person to be more accepting while provoking someone on a similar road to make wiser choices (while not condemning the behavior).

014100018X|4.0|This book is simply magical.  Lovely and mysterious Vianne Rocher arrives in a tiny, close-minded French provincial town with her daughter, Anouk, and turns the town upside down.  Vianne and Anouk open the sweet shop La Celeste Praline during Lent and soon are the talk of the neighborhood.  However, the Rochers are most unwelcome by the town's priest, Pere Francis Reynaud, who views the sweet shop as a direct attack on the church and an irresistable temptation to his simple-minded congregation during the church's holiest season.  Perhaps Reynaud has a special reason to fear temptation?<br />Slowly, things in the town begin to change.  Josephine Muscat leaves her abusive spouse.  Guillaume comes out of his shell.  The &quot;river people&quot; find a home and a friend in Vianne, Josephine, and Armande Voizin, the town's oldest resident.  All these changes occur under the sensitive watch of Vianne.<br />I loved the beautiful descriptions of the town.  The townfolk were richly drawn and complex.  Even the villian, Reynaud, was given an opportunity to narrate and reveal the origins of his fears--making him a multi-dimensional character instead of simply the &quot;Black Man&quot;.  And I loved the idea of chocolate as a type of magical elixir (I've always known that it was!).<br />This is the second book I've read by Joanne Harris, the first being &quot;Five Quarters of the Orange&quot;.  Both were excellent, but &quot;Chocolat&quot; is softer, sweeter, while still tackling serious subjects in a generous and kind-hearted manner.  This is a beautiful tale of penance and redemption, of the foolishness of self-deprivation, and about chocolate as the root of all good.  Highly recommended.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I went into seeing this movie pre-hype (advanced screening) with the knowledge that I enjoyed The Virgin Suicides, as well as Bill Murray in his dramatic turn in Rushmore, and that I was a bit luke warm in regards to the premise, as presented in the trailers (especially the concept of the age-gap relationship, amongst other things). <BR>In the end, what I saw was a focused, fully-realized work of art that brought forth a beautiful series of human emotional truths that transcended the basics of its story through its balances between joy and pain, comedy and tragedy, emotion and narrative. This film is an exquisite and unique amalgam of light, color, temporal rhythm, music, and emotion, all of which adds up to being one of my personal favorite cinematic experiences of the year, or recent years.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have watched a LOT of sci-fi shows and movies and FireFly is by far the best, despite it's abbreviated first season due to the short-sighted and clueless execs at the Fox network.  The chemistry between the cast within the first few episodes rivals any of the Star Trek casts' even several seasons in.  Joss Whedon and the other writers did a wonderful job of blending a heroic western action-show with a futuristic sci-fi show while still making the characters realistic, flawed, yet likeable and easy to relate to.  Keeping my fingers crossed for the rumored movie.  Keep Flying!
0446677450|3.0|It's a good book and gets you thinking, but a lot of these reviews confirmed what came to my mind reading it about how he's so vague about things, his hinting toward insider trading.  Maybe I'm the only one who noticed this, but doesn't he seem to have quite the vocabulary and education when asking and rephrasing what his rich dad was asking him when he was only nine years old?!?!?!  Some of the things he's supposedly saying (and even recalling from nine years of age) is absurd.  I'm only 27 and all I remember from being nine was the third grade and a couple of friends where I used to live.  I couldn't tell you or recall one thing I ever said to anyone or what they said to me.  It's too far fetched.  I'm glad I'm finding that other stuff is being discovered that he made up, such as his multi-person rich dad and how vague he is when asked about this book.  Thank you for the other reviews everyone!

B00003CXDD|1.0|PLEASE save your money and buy instead any of the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings extended editions and not this piece of garbage!<br />That fact that george Lucas directed this (see my review for Phantom Menace) shoulda warned me but I watched this anyway and boy was it BAD!<br />George Lucas is not a directer of stories characters or actors he just throws BIG special efects on the screen and hopes it all makes sense and that you'll care. WRONG!<br />You gotta have plot character and the mythic element of the hero for fantasy to work and to make great movies on the subject. I wish Peter jackson would remake this cuz it has some cool things in it like the two headed dragons [did they have cgi back then??] and the devil-dog creatures and the guy with the skull face but this is tipical of Lucas who likes to spend money on everything but a good scriptwriters and a good story. Oh well!
B0000027I6|5.0|the real genious behind pink floyd has struck once again.this album is a must have for floyd fans. menacing guitar licks and solo's from jeff beck who join roger on this solo effort shows the man can do it without the the other floyd boys. this by far rivals division bell and other post waters, pink floyd efforts. the lyrics are true roger waters genious and wit.
B000063UR2|1.0|Since first seeing the Lord of the Rings movies of Peter Jackson fame i became interested in myths and fantasy and related films. But I have been sadly dispointed. You see, few other directers of fantasy/mythology flicks have the grand vision and talent of Peter jackson who is a *true* genius :)<br />Case in pont: this piece of junk from the dark ages aka the 80s [how did people stand these bad movies or did they just not know better??]<br />More camp cute stuff that does not take fantasy/mythology *seriously* and does NOT aspire to be a truly great film. The story is stupid, the characters shalow, the music is bad and the acting is supposed to be funny but ISNT.<br />Funny how it took one man [PJ :)] to make a fantasy/myth worth watching. And dont say it wuz all cuz Tolkin cuz i tried to read that book and it stinks (see my review for FOtR). i mean maybe back in the 50s when it was writen noone cared about plot or character but Pete obviously saw the *potential* of the material and he DID something with it unlike the people who made THIS piece of junk.<br />Just cuz its fantasy dont mean its gotta be for kids!!
B00005JKZV|5.0|When The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; premired a little over 2 years ago, I marvelled at the magnificence and sheer beauty of a film which so wonderfully captured the essence of the J.R.R. Tolkein novel of the same name. I sat spellbound for most of three hours, completely captivated by the imagery set before me. Then, when I received the &quot;Fellowship&quot; on DVD later that year, I was re-introduced to Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth in a way that allowed me to once more delve into this immensely beautiful film, and I found that with additional viewing, I learned more about the characters, the places and the events that unfold in the film.  It made owning the film a pricelss addition to my film library.<br />I am thrilled and delighted to say that I have had the same experience with &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;. This second installment of the film continues where &quot;Fellowship&quot; leaves off, with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Austin) continuing their quest onward to Mount Doom. Along the way, they capture and befriend Gollum, who had initially sought them out in hopes of reclaiming the ring, his &quot;Precious&quot;.<br />Things are amiss in Middle Earth as Suraman (Christopher Lee), under the eye of Sauren, continues building an orc army that will be used to rise up against the powers that oppose Mordor. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhyse-Davies) are in pursuit of thier captured counterparts, Merry(Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin(Billy Boyd), two hobbits who ventured out by chance with Frodo and Sam in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. <br />As with the novel by the same title &quot;The Two Towers&quot; expands the realm of Middle Earth, and introduces us to many new characters, including the beautiful Eowen (Miranda Otto), daughter to King Theoden, who finds herself falling for the mysterious Aragorn when he helps free her father from the manipulations of Sauren.<br />This is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who has been fortunate enough to experience any part of this major epic movie series. These films go far and beyond any undertaking of this magnitude thus far and the results are films of such quality that they will forever raise the bar for filmmakers in the future. Make this collection a part of your DVD library. If these films continue to achieve the acclaim that Tolkien's original &quot;Ring&quot; series has maintained in the literary world, than these films promise to entertain for generations to come, providing a canvas which contains some of the most beautiful, elaborate and indeed, complex cinematography ever seen. <br />-Scott Kolecki
B000053VAF|1.0|I think that's the biggest beef I have with this movie - that some actually think it's \\"intelligent\\"! How far we have fallen ...<br />Is it blasphemous? Not really ... it's too puerile in its pretensions to be blasphemous, because it ends up taking shots at an unrecognizable form of Catholicism. Monty Python, while hilarious, makes the same mistake - they've ignored Homer Simpson's \\"it's funny because it's true.\\" The best humor and satire work because they things they parody and attach are represented somewhat accurately. \\"Dogma\\" spoofs a \\"straw God\\" - a God of their own invention. And falls flat.<br />Is it funny? There are a couple of funny bits, but otherwise it's surprisingly lame in scripting and pace. I enjoy a good satire as much as the next guy (\\"Life of Brian\\" comes to mind, although again saddled with its addled \\"theology\\". But whereas Python is enjoyable because of their silliness, \\"Dogma\\" limps because it's just stupid and shows a pretentious non-understanding of the subject matter.) \\"Clerks\\" is infinitely better in these areas. (Warning for those who haven't watched it: \\"Clerks\\" is funny but quite vulgar.) Affleck and Damon are good at delivering what passes for sophistry these days, but the heroine, Bethany, is flat, lifeless, monotonic, and sardonic. Almost as if she didn't realize the camera was rolling and it was time to act. Chris Rock suffers through awful lines. Rickman is somewhat fun, although his lines suffer from the movie's childish theology.<br />Is it parody? Satire? People, it's just not intelligent enough for either. Unless \\"Can God make a rock to heavy for Himself to lift\\" is the extent of your idea of intelligent philosophizing.<br />As for charges that the Catholic Church slept throught the Holocaust - perhaps *reading* (since we're at Amazon, after all) some actual history will prevent such tired falsehoods from showing up in scripts in the future. Wasn't a Pope honored by the Jewish people for saving Jews? Seems to ring a bell...
0060090367|1.0|The main reason that I purchased &quot;Watermelon&quot; is that I really liked &quot;Lucy Sullivan is getting Married&quot; by Marian Keyes. But &quot;Watermelon&quot; is such a bad book. I found the main character Claire Webster to one of the unlikeable characters ever! And don't even start me on her crazy family. I couldn't even keep their names straight. I just don't understand how this book could be such a bestseller.<br />Unless you are a fan of Marian Keyes, you may want to skip this book at all costs!
B000002J09|5.0|Probably Zeppelin's most widely known album, as well as their biggest selling album(over 22 million copies sold in the United States alone), ZOSO is a culmination of what the band accomplished on their previous three albums. It combines hard rock, blues rock and their new found sense of writing just as excellent acoustic music. Jimmy Page's prowess as a guitar god is completely consolidated on tracks like the complex hard rock of &quot;Black Dog,&quot; and the acoustic &quot;Going to California.&quot; Thier quintessential &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; combines folk and hard rock perfectly, and it is one of the most requested songs on rock radio, still. &quot;Stairway,&quot; though not their best song, was definitely the prototypical power ballad. Yet, the climax of this album is its closer, &quot;When The Levee Breaks,&quot; with John Bonham's metronomic drumming, Page's bluesy yet creative guitars, and Robert Plant's still passionate vocals (before his vocal cords became completey shot), it serves as the perfect finale to a Zeppelin album, and only leaves a fan hungry for more of their music.<br />Sure, ZOSO is slightly overrated, and is often seen as their best album. Many critics and Led Zeppelin fans have very different opinions on the band's greatest work. Yet, all eight tracks on ZOSO (even the overlooked &quot;Four Sticks&quot; and their ode to the Hobbitt &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;) receive a substantial amount of radio play, over three decades after its November 1971 release, and it only made the band even bigger and greater. Its cohesiveness is also unquestionable, since III, and subsequent albums (Houses of the Holy, Physical Graffiti), were in a way disorganized and some songs seemed out of place. The messiness of those albums turn more people onto ZOSO, and it sounds whole and damn near perfect. ZOSO inevitably stands as Zeppelin's gargantuan triumph.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|If I could give negative stars I would.  I remember reading once that startrek was at the time it was created thought of as a western in space.  Well the guy who created this series decided just to basically pick up a western series and put in space.  Its a stupid series- you can get more entertainment watching old westerns on tv land.  IF you into true sci-fi spend your money on Stargate or Babylon 5 or just about anything else because this will dissapoint you.
B00000JPH6|1.0|Wow. How many bad fantasy movies can you make in one decade?!<br />i first became intrested in this jenre cuasa Peter Jackson :) and his *brilliant* Lord of the Rings series of films. So i thought id take a lil' history lesson and watch all the 'classic' fantasy/mythology flciks that are out there.<br />Thing is: PJs a *genius* these guys were all hacks. Case in point: this stupid movie.<br />The filmakers were obviously too cheap to hire real acters to play the parts so they did it all with PUPPETS and thought no one would notice! I'm NOT kidding you!<br />It took me about five minutes to notice that i was watching a bunch of hand puppets. Besides that the plot, characters, story, and special efefcts are all cheap and stupid. The music is the WORST i have ever heard.<br />Don't waste your money on these old movies made before anyone knew how to make a movie worth watching. i mean it was ok back then but no one knew any better but now there is NO excuse! unless your to lazy to use your brain and rent a REAL movie like Lord of the Rings in which case enjoy this cuz its perfect for you!
0679745203|5.0|This is a tremendous book by an enormously gifted writer.  Ondaatje's prose is both langurous and sensuous as the story glides back and forth in time, recounting the love affair between the eponymous &quot;english patient&quot; and Catherine Clifton, a married British woman.  When Ondaatje is on, he is on with full force, and this book serves as testament to his fluid narrative skills.  Passion and love--themes that almost defy original writing--are presented plainly, even austerely; yet Ondaatje's phrasing and style lend immense lyricism to the starkness of his words.  More absorbing than Almasy (the english patient) and Catherine's affair is Hannah and Kip's, perhaps because the latter shows an honesty and reality that the former somewhat lacks.  Theirs is a wary, awkward courtship punctuated with frustrations that are recognizably human.  But &quot;The English Patient&quot; is more than just a twin love story--poetic and haunted, it is about the ghosts of the past and how we strive to reclaim them, even as we try to escape them.

B00006LPEY|5.0|This incredible movie is guaranteed to need multiple viewings, if only to unravel the depths and subtleties of its extremely imaginative story, so it won't hurt for me to give you a bit of an overview: A government led secret research project produces unexpected results in one of its subjects, and it takes WWIII to cover it up! And then, 10 seconds further into the movie, things start to really move. Akira tells an ultimate, if somewhat gruesome, coming of age story, fleshed out with high-speed action, sharp social observations, ethereal moments of great beauty, ethereal moments of great violence, and visceral explorations of psychic overload.<br />I've seen a number of complaints about the new English translation, and I have to say... so what? Its the new Japanese 5.1 version you should be experiencing. A movie of such inspired intensity should have an audio track to equal it, and after some quick comparisons between the English and Japanese tracks on this DVD, it quickly becomes apparent that the Japanese track is the perfect companion. The English track is tame and sparse, localized largely up front, but with the Japanese track you're in the mix, the environment spacious, the score places the instruments discreetly around you, creating the best version of this movie I've had the pleasure to enjoy. Sadly, this version does not include any extras, but in this case, I don't mind.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The Strokes certainly HAVE created an albumfull of energetic yet slackerish power pop tunes. Drawing equally from the Cars and the Doors, the Strokes have definetely mastered their craft on their second album. Although not posessing a particularly interesting frontman or instrumental expertise, the Strokes use cheesy synth work and poor production to create a semi- brilliant lo-fi masterpiece. After a false start with the lack-luster &quot;What Ever Happened?&quot;, Room on Fire blasts out with the rocker &quot;Reptilia&quot; and coasts through the rest of the way with several bright spots and nothing particularly ungood (to quote Orwell). But Jules, c'mon, you are a rockstar! Show it!
B00013F35I|5.0|I was never a big Bruce Springstein fan, although I collected a few of his c.d.s because of his importance to music, and I did like some of his songs, he is great. However, if there were a fire in my home, or I needed to make a speedy evacuation two things I would grab are my Bruce Springstein 'Rising' c.d. and Bruce Springstein and the E Street Band in Barcelona! Really I would!<br />I took my daughter to see Bruce and the Band when they visited our town for the 'Rising'tour.<br />My favorite pick on the Barcelona D.V.D. is on disc two, Ramrod, the band together having fun, Bruce is a riot!<br />What a showman! The love these people show one another, Bruce had all of us in the palm of his hand. I pray I get to see them again.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Give Jessica Simpson 'Everytime'?? Let Christina sing 'Everytime'?? That would be horrid to listen to. Christina's got an amazing voice and I'm not saying Jessica's a bad singer but I think Britney would be the only one who would be able to feel it when she's singing because she also wrote that song. I love that song and listening to someone else sing it would be a nightmare. <BR>Apart from Everytime, Shadow, is the other ballad on the album which is also wonderful. Brave New girl, Toxic, MATM, Touch of my hand, The hook up and Showdown are my other personal favourites. Outrageous and Breathe on me are pretty ok. Early Morning is the only bummer track on the album. <BR>  I'm not much into R&amp;B/ hip hop, and I'd prefer the old Britney a lot more. But the world seems to be accepting the new Britney anyway so I guess that's good for her. It's also about time she started writing her own songs which she has. They're not the best lyrics but pretty decent and acceptable. <BR>  Whatever happened to all the bubblegum pop?? Hip Hop is nice but I'll admit I like bubblegum pop more...<BR> Seriously whatever happened to the 'Baby one more time' and Genie in the bottle days??

B00004TX5F|5.0|I saw this movie in the theartre when it was new. It's such a beautiful film to look at, and the music is so incredible you forget that it's in Flemmish and you're reading subtitles.<br />If you like this movie I would also reccomend reading \\"Cry to Heaven\\" by Anne Rice. It's a story of the castrati and gives you an understanding of that time in history. It's a great compliment to the movie. As one has nothing to do with the other it's just a very fortunate coincidence.<br />It's sad that there are no recordings of these beautiful voice as  this custom was stopped and those who had performed had died before machanical recordings were popular. I beleive there was one who was actually recorded by Thomas edison on his new invention. <br />It's something anyone alaive today will never be able to hear.
0446608955|5.0|Annotation: A romantic novel written by Nicholas Sparks about true love for the first time. As Nicholas Sparks would put it, first you will laugh, then you will cry. This novel takes place in 1958 telling a tale so riveting and touching, it's a book you wont forget. Jamie Sullivan, the girl Landon Carter was least likely to fall in love with. She showed him the \\"joy and the pain of living,\\" love and most importantly, spirituality.<br /> Author Bio: Nicholas Sparks was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on New Year's Eve 1966. As a child he lived in various places such as Minnesota, Los Angeles, and Grand Island Nebraska. His mother worked as a homemaker, then an optometrist's assistant, and his father was a professor. He lived in Fair Oaks California through high school where he graduated valedictorian in 1984, and received a full ride scholarship to the University of Notre Dame. He broke the Notre Dame school record on the relay team in 1985, but unfortunately, he injured himself causing him to spend an entire summer recovering. During that summer, he wrote his first novel, even though it was never published. He majored in business finance and once again graduated with honors in 1988. During that same year, he met his wife Catherine on spring break. At this point in his life, he wrote his second novel, which was never published. He also worked a variety of different jobs for the next three years, which include: real estate appraisal, waiting tables, selling dental products by phone, and managing his own manufacturing business. In 1990, he worked on a book with Billy Mills, the Olympic gold medallist. This book was published and this is where Nicholas Sparks received his publicity for the first time. From the years 1994 to 2001, Nicholas wrote many novels such as: The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, A Walk To Remember, The Rescue, and A Bend in the Road. Today he lives in North Carolina with his wife and five children.<br />Evaluation: Overall, this book is an excellent book to read because of its content and its spiritual significance. It was a book that automatically captured my interest because it was a romantic novel. There were many main events that leave the reader thinking about spirituality, love, and hope. The book's main character was Landon Carter, who was a typical high school senior growing up in Beaufort, North Carolina in 1958. His life completely changed when was elected as student body president, when he was asked to play the role Tom Thorton in the school play, A Christmas Angel, and most importantly, when he met Jamie Sullivan. She changed his life dramatically, and showed him love for the first time. The best part about this book is watching Landon's character change when he falls in love with Jamie.  It was ironic that he would fall in love with her because she was the last person he would've ever thought he could fall in love with. She was the minister's daughter, and changed everyone's life within the town in more than one way. I recommend this book to anyone, not just people who are interested in romantic novels, but anyone who is interested in a very moving and tragic story that leaves you feeling inspired and enthused.
0441003257|5.0|Good Omens is one of the best books I have ever read. Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet have stuck gold! Their combined talents have created both an ingeniously perfect author and a likewise ingenious book.<br /> Good Omens is a double edged sword, one which can inspire great fits of laughter and a deep thought process that will lead you from International Express deliverymen to angels to Satan. This book rivals Douglas Adams humor and improves upon his seemingly random, but actually well thought out story line. This book will make you want to read it again and again!
0385504209|3.0|After the to do about this book, I expected worse. The basic story is that after all the guardians of the Grail secret are killed, Robert, the hero of Angels and Demons, and the granddaughter of the grand master team up to discover who killed the men and why. Through mathematical and etymological codes and clues the arrive at the truth about the murders and encounter the legend that Mary Magdalene was both Christ's wife and the mother of His child and would have lead the church had Peter not protested.<br />Granted, the novel on a fictional level is deftly written and contains plenty of action and adventure. Those who have compared it to a romantic novel must have a stereotypical view of romance novels, for it has only a hint of that.<br />Historically and theologically, it is replete with errors, and not just regarding the relationship between Mary and Christ. A good lawyer could demolish that allegation in ten seconds. Or less.<br />Those who feel that this book threatens the church must have a low opinion of Christ's true bride. The true church, as noted by Lewis, is a thing to make demons tremble, and not as gullible as the mobsters of the historic Piece of the Action episode of Trek.
B0000DC151|4.0|I don't know what people are complaining about.  These episodes are just excellent.  The characters are maturing, physically and emotionally, and what's wrong with that?  I especially appreciated how Miranda and her baby were represented.  How often do you see real \\"working\\" breasts on TV in close-up?  The baby seems real.  It wasn't just born and then disappeared, like on some shows.  This baby has had a real effect on Miranda, and it's not a bed of roses.  I appreciated this.<BR>Anyway, the price is high, but so rent the videos.  I rented them without waiting right when they came out.

I have been searching for Yentl on DVD for the past year as it is one of the best films I have ever seen and I am a great fan of Ms Streisand. Hopefully the DVD will be released soon as there is so much crap being released on DVD, why not a class movie like Yentl?

Would make an amazing present for anyone - I had it as a christmas present but had to wrestle it out of the hands of different family members who were all just as enthralled by it.<br />Is great to read as a journal / art book but also SO INSPIRING for anyone who would like to or does draw. Danny's weblog is also worth checking out at [...] for even more inspiration!<br />This is the type of book you don't read just once, everytime you pick it up, you notice something different.

B00003CXXS|1.0|This movie was horrible... I wish they could have just stuck with the original story of Jurassic Park. I don't think anyone enjoyed the idea of a new island, I mean, where the hell did this come from?? Or maybe I just missed something in the other two.... been quite a while since I've seen them. The other day I started the Jurassic Park book... I insist you people get more into reading than watching movies, the original work was MUCH better. The acting in this movies sucked and the story was many times worse. JOHN HAMMOND ISN'T EVEN IN THE GOD DAMNED MOVIE! He was the one who started the whole thing, what the hell happened to him?? Another thing, there was no background to the movie, most of this stuff just came out of no where. You could call the Lost World a work of art compared to this movie. Can't believe Steven Spielburg didn't direct it, he brought life to the first two. I suggest everyone stick to the first movie, it was the only one with a real plot...
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I saw the original TIME MACHINE when I was a wide-eyed, easily terrified nine year old.  Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux were its stars.  Taylor was heroically masculine and Mimieux was beautifully innocent, and the Morlocks were green and had shiny white eyes.<br />40 some years later, we get Guy Pearce and Samantha Mumba.  Pearce, while a fine actor in \\"Memento\\" couldn't come anywhere near the brute heroism of Mr. Taylor; Mamba can't touch Mimieux for pure sexy innocence.  And the Morlocks, well, I guess I've gotten so used to these excellent new CGI effects that I didn't find them very frightening at all.<br />I have nothing against remaking classics.  Although they don't usually outshine the original, it's interesting to see how these movies are treated now that we have become so FXective.<br />This version doesn't have the heart and energy of the first; the only scene that really made a strong impression was when the Moon got nuked and was falling out of the sky.  If the movie had more bizarrely beautiful scenes like this, it could have been awesome.<br />The Eloi/Morlock storyline is so similar to the one in \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" it seems redundant.  I wasn't all to sure exactly what happened to the Morlocks, either.<br />This is probably better than the remake of PLANET OF THE APES (the ending killed that one!), but I find the original with Rod and Yvette the better of the two.

B000001F3C|5.0|1983's \\"War\\" is remember as the album where U2 saw their status as a formidable force come to fruition and with good reason. This album is absolutely incredible and was a great commercial leap forward from their previous two albums. It was where they had their first major hit \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" followed by the eerie and enigmatic \\"New Year's Day\\" both of which are not only amazing but have defied the passing years and are still powerful anthems for the 21st century amidst the turbulent era we're going through right now. The band brings forth an album that has a very pure and powerful expression of political expressions, pure fury and a desperation that is not seen on any album of theirs since then. \\"War\\" in a lot of ways has a unique appeal against their latter albums because most of the music on this album has a very raw and live audio quality to it like as if they recorded the music right out of the living room and straight onto tape. <br /> For a long time, \\"War\\" may have been the soundtrack to a past time of turbulence and international turmoil but now with the war-machine going on like a previous reviewer stated, \\"War\\" has regained a great deal of it's chilling power and could help save us from the injury of a war mongering leadership. The album cover alone gets my nod as one of the scariest but most riveting album covers of all time. The expression is very unsettling like telling of something dangerous or horrible that has or will happen if we do nothing to stop it from occurring. <br /> The two hit songs off this album are not only the most well-known but also among the best on this album. \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is a very chilling but highly imaginative track with a very raw, live feel and a much younger Bono bringing forth some of the greatest vocals I've ever heard from him. The music itself is really amazing, being something that is so raw and relatively unpolished in production. In this way, \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" is a really great song that benefitsfrom the rawness of its sound. This was one of my first exposures to U2's music. \\"New Year's Day\\" gets my nod as the greatest song of U2's early period. This is a really powerful and sometimes scary song aobut the eeriness of a possible silence before or after a major event, either good or bad based on the lyrical line \\"All is quiet on New Year's Day\\". Those distant echoing piano riffs that dominate the track are absolutely hypnotizing and give the song a very chilling and enigmatic feel that rivals the atmospherics of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" but through a different light. I don't find much satisfaction with the shortened radio edit version with the rock guitars fading out and prefer the full-length version with the echoing pianos rounding out the track. The third but minor hit is/was \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\". This is a very upbeat and joyous song. <br /> Some of the non-singles though are worth mentioning also. \\"Like A Song\\" is almost like two songs in one. It starts with pulsating drums and a haunting guitar riff and becomes a very intense and compelling song. The last minute of the song becomes a very menacing and sometimes scary melody with the drums becoming loud and pounding and the melody becoming a minor note before fading out. My favorite song though of the non-singles is the fifth track called \\"Drowning Man\\". This is a very moving and powerful song with a very downbeat vibe and a highly protesting mood to it. I love the acoustic 12-string guitars that dominate the middle of the song. \\"Surrender\\" is a really hauntingly beautiful song with a mix of rock and some atmospherics that give the song a distant and remote feel to it. I completely disagree with someone saying that it's too long. It's just about perfect at its five and a half minute length. \\"Red Light\\" is a very interesting song starting with a haunting female chorus and melting into an edgy and somewhat jazz-oriented song. <br />The last song \\"40\\" is pretty good too but it's not a whole lot to writehome about and feels more like a leftover from the \\"October\\" era recording sessions. <br /> U2 have carried on since then to create better albums but \\"War\\" is Pretty much the album where they first reached their status as a musical tour de force. With their next album \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" the following, they built on the greatness of this album and created their best album alongside \\"Achtung Baby\\" seven years after that but do not let those two albums overshadow \\"War\\". \\"War\\" is a really well-rounded album and incredible for such a raw and sometimes undercooked album and the instability in Ireland around 1983 that this album brings to light gives this album a sense of power not seen on their other albums, even on those that are overall better than this one. This is a definite must-have album and should not be passed up.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The more you watch, the more you see and appreciate the effort. Read the book and remember WWI &amp; II.
B00006AUIG|2.0|This overrated film suffers from a lack of cohesion and misleading subplots that add nothing to the film.  For instance, the title SESSION 9 would make you think this mysterious session captured on reel to reel is at the heart of the movie.  Ultimately, it's a Macguffin, and has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie.  It's extremely slow paced and by the time something happens, it's hopelessly underdone.  I can't fault the actors; they did their best with this stinker script.  Peter Mullan, Josh Lucas and even David Caruso do their best, but it's a sinking ship me lads.<br />As for the &quot;deleted scenes,&quot; who in the heck was this old lady running around?  Can see why these scenes were deleted.  Maybe the whole script should have been deleted and redone.<br />If you must see, rent.  Don't buy---the 2 stars if for the acting and some of the eerie photography.
0446530891|2.0|I'm a big fan of Baldacci's and to say he writes real page-turners is an understatement.  He's one of the very best.  Great characters, great stories.  He obviously does extensive research for his novels.  Unfortunately, however, Split Second does not live up to his prior good works. Actually, everything is okay until you near the end when it gets quite improbable and the ending itself is just ridiculously goofy - almost laughable, in fact.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|It's hard to ignore the comparisons to Matrix and Blade action sequences, set designs, wardrobe, and wall/ceiling destruction.  Yes the actions scenes are slowed down while a dark blue tinged, protruding, picture carries you through a film of gunfire, some martial arts, and rain.  A very gothic movie.  <br />Despite the comparisons, watch with an open mind, because the concept is very unique, and the story is intresting and smart.  One idea they must've have stolen from Blade or other movies with gun firing vampires is a silver nitrate bullet.  But, who ever said vampires were allergic to silver?  Werewolves are! <br />Please, watch this movie with an open mind, and don't be turned off by the influences of the Matrix and Blade because you will not be able to appreciate what could be an awesome movie, I can't wait til a sequel comes out.  <br />Like many other men watching this movie I sat down hoping for gore, body parts flying, and maybe a nude scene from Kate Beckinsale, HEY do not watch it hoping for that, you will get blood, you will get a hot herioin in black latex, and you will get an awesome story with serious acting, more convincing and real dialogue than the dead faced Matrix, and better ideas and concepts than Blade.  <br />One last note... rent this movie.
B00005JMTQ|4.0|Something's Gotta Give boasts a group of talented actors that played out their roles with great natural charm (yes! this means Keanu too but everyone knows that). This movie brought back all the romantic and charismatic movies of yesteryear, which now unfortunately have been replaced by exaggerated shoot out scenes, overdone sex and ridiculous one-liners to say the least. It shows that mature older people are not dried out prunes but who are accomplished human beings with (and this bit shouldn't make your stomach churn!) an active healthy sex life. The praising/judging of bachelor/spinsterhoods is just ludicrous. This movie shows that whether you are young, old, a bachelor or a spinster, you can achieve a lot of things if you have the determination and passion for it. And most of all, there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting older and taking chances to try something new. I can only hope that my life will lead to a prosperous, exciting and romantic mature one, in years to come with lots of things to show for it.
B000089RVR|3.0|Well, Dido seems to be having fun! She has all those personal pictures on the album with one showing fans with a &quot;We love Dido&quot; banner. I agree. Her voice dissapears into the atmosphere and I wonder if, borrowing the words from the previous album, she &quot;could fly?&quot; What a nice devil Dido is!<br />She seems to love being a mischievious &quot;ghost&quot; in &quot;Don't leave home.&quot; Wouldn't you like to lock up someone you didn't like? One of the most beautiful songs in the album was &quot;Meet you when you are 40.&quot; What a nice way to say &quot;I hate you so cha-cha for now!&quot; For those stressed with modern life, who cannot but agree with her hurried song about the fast life-&quot;Sand in my shoes?&quot;<BR> <BR>Finally, the last song, &quot;Closer&quot; was not mentioned in the album! Instead, after the depressing song of track 11 about the death of a lover, &quot;See the Sun again,&quot; (This is one of my favorite songs) at 5:01 minutes you hear an horribly distorted voice resembling &quot;L'cormanac!&quot; two minutes of silence, then the beginning of the last song, which starts with &quot;You left your taxi waiting...&quot; Nice song! I wonder if she inserted the garbled phrase in the album to scare listeners? It's more frightening than the previously mentioned &quot;Don't Leave Home!&quot; Did she disappear for four years because she was embarrased at the Amazon reviews? Who knows, but borrowing another phrase from Dido, I say the more she sings, &quot;The better I feel!&quot; Good job Queen Dido!

6301969294|5.0|As an Architect, my opinion is biased by actual experience in this field, but, this movie made me laugh so hard the first time I saw it, it became one of my all time favorites. No architect I have ever met acted anywhere near as self rightious as Roarke, they'de be working at MickieD's the rest of there lifes, as NO ONE would ever hire them, not even to clean pools. Architecture is about knowing your client needs and providing a solution that meets all the requirements of the client, city, and context. That being said, this movies a HOOT!!!<br />First off, too all the Rand-ites out there, THIS IS A MOVIE! get over the fact that the book is better, every book is better than the movie, thats the nature of the beast. <br />For the Non-Rand-ites out there, SEE IT SEE IT SEE IT. This movie is a melodramotic potboiler of bad movie bliss. Dont get me wrong, the production values are excellent, its beautifully shot and the cinematography is terrific. The archtectural projects are really spectacular and completely impossible to build, so they are way over the top. But the script is pure Hooey! and the music is sooooo overly-dramatic. Thats what makes this such a great film too watch. Only Ann Rand could take a good novel and cram it into such a laughably compacted screenplay. I felt I has watching cliffnotes from the novel. In the first 5 minutes a year of the story goes by, and the whole film is like that. <br />There are some very good moments in the film though, topped by Coopers speech to the jury. But the best sceen is after the \\"drills in the quarry\\" scene when Patrica Oneill is thinking of Cooper and in the background are images of drills with this completely campy Xylophone music acompanying it. Its one of the most overtly sexual suggestive scenes ever put of film and it hilarious, and dont forget to wait till the end, when you can see the Worlds Greatest 200 story Phallic Symbol ever created on film in the Wymann Building, with Cooper standing on top of course!
B00005JMCT|1.0|I won't go into the movie. Those who have seen it know it's a funny, yet heart-warming story in the end. The movie itself I would give about 3.5 stars. American Pie 1 and 2 are better, but AW is NOT a bad movie and is still an excellent final chapter to the entire American Pie series. My qualms lie with what Universal Studios has chosen to do with the ads, and it occured with a previous Universal DVD release, Animal House.<br />The AW DVD has some features that are cool, including deleted scenes and the Unrated version goes into why they created an unrated version. What I also like with the unrated DVD release is that you have both the theatrical release and the unrated version. I think that's an excellent marketing ploy. The extra scenes are okay, but I don't know if they are totally worth it except one part where Finch, Kevin and Stifler are asked if they would like to see the two strippers kiss. Their answer to it is hilarious and it pays a great homage to AP2.<br />But, the one annoying thing about this DVD (as it is with the Animal House DVD) and is the only reason I gave the DVD a 1-star rating, is the commercials. Now, supposedly, unlike the Animal House DVD, you can skip the commercials. Yet, I was unable to skip them with my particular DVD player except by stopping the movie and then restarting it. This is better than my Animal House DVD, in which my only recourse was to turn off the DVD player.<br />So, if you don't mind having the commercials thrown into your face and you haven't seen this movie, I would suggest possibly renting it first to see if you want it. I myself have already written my displeasure with Animal House and American Wedding to Universal. I have a feeling this is the route they will continue to take, which is sad as I have other Universal movies on DVD that I enjoy. However, if enough consumers write to them and complain, hopefully they will listen and change their tactics.<br />Again, the movie is funny and great (3.5 stars), but the DVD release with the adds forced upon the viewer is what kills the rating for this release. In fact, if we had the option, this DVD would have possibly gotten a zero from me. And believe me, I LOVE my movies!DVD release with the adds forced upon the viewer is what kills the rating for this release.

B00009TB5G|5.0|All I have to say is that this movie is amazing.  Wonderful acting and special effects.  Two thumbs up!
B00005YW4H|1.0|i bought this CD back in 2001 because i was going to a bunch of indigo girls shows where norah jones was opening (to think that wasn't too long ago...).  live, jones is ok.  however, her CD bores me.  the songs all sound the same.  not to mention that she doesn't even write most of her own stuff.  the &quot;don't know why&quot; song that's all over the radio is ok.  the rest of the CD is pretty bad.
0792841859|4.0|this one follows into a southern down when 3 activist boys, i black, 2 white, dissapear one night and 2 federal agents from the north, Gene Hackman(Behind Enemy Lines, Bonnie and Clyde) and Willem Dafoe(Shadow Of The Vampire, Once Upon A Time In Mexico) come down ad investigate, only to be pulled into the hate of the town their in...and also Hackman was once a member of that town also. fits in with some pretty intense scenes...though the acting is really superb and well done and the end where the bad guys get what they deserve is good as well. also starring, R. Lee Ermey(Saving Silverman, Dead Man Walking), Brad Dourif(The Two Towers, NightWatch), Frances McDormand(Fargo, Blood Simple), Pruitt Taylor Vince(Trapped, Identity), Kevin Dunn(Snake Eyes, Stir Of Echoes), Badja Djola(An Innocent Man, The Last Boy Scout), Rick Zieff(Drop Zone, tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and Michael Rooker(Replicant, The 6th Day). this is a movie not to be missed if your a Hackman fan..Hackman delivers a solid and outstanding performance and so does Dafoe as usual
B0000A02TZ|1.0|First off, I love Animal House. There is no reason for me to even explain the movie. Animal House and the Blues Brothers are the best Landis/Belushi movies of all time. There are some special features such as a \\"Where are they now\\" featurette featuring many of the original cast (except Belushi of course). But, even those features and this excellent movie cannot save this DVD from a one-star rating.<br /><br />As others have stated, not being able to skip the adds at the beginning of the DVD is a poor marketing decision. They did the same with American Wedding, but at least, I can hit stop on my DVD player to stop the DVD, whereas with Animal House, I have to turn off my DVD player. Very poor.<br /><br />I have already written to Universal Studios about my displeasure with their decision for both Animal House and American Wedding and have informed them that unless they change their tactics, I refuse to purchase another Universal DVD release and that hundreds of other purchasers feel the same, based on reviews at Amazon.com.<br /><br />Stay away from this if you absolutely feel that not being able to skip the adds is wrong. Otherwise, be prepared to sit through 5+ minutes of commercials for other Universal movies. Your best bet is to go make some popcorn and come back. At that point, it should be done and then you can enjoy this excellent, funny parody of life in a frat house in the late 60s.<br /><br />Toga! Toga! Toga!
B0000UHFC6|5.0|I absolutly love this album.  It's an amazing work of art.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Ah, System of a Down, how you get my brain going! Of all the music I've heard in the past few years, few get ME going as much as System of a Down -- first with Toxicity, and now with Steal This Album (I still haven't heard the self-titled debut... shame on me).<br />For me, I just get into a certain mental \\"zone\\" when listening to either of these albums. It's a state that could most accurately be described as a kind of high, an illusion of flying, or a wonderful synchronization of both of my brain hemispheres. Bottom line; it's a distinct, truly pleasurable experience. <br />For starters: this isn't as good as Toxicity, (if I read correctly), the album of which the rejects make up this album? Anyhow, it lacks the coherence and smoothness which that album excelled so much at. If, in fact, Steal this Album is merely a number of rejected Toxicity songs, it makes good sense; few, if any, of the songs here really match the unparalleled brilliance of most of those on Toxicity. The thing is, they're just ONE notch below, and that still makes most of them good, sometimes very good.<br />So, basically, the album contains the same incredible energy that Toxicity brought with it, even if it's a much more jagged album. The lyrical overtones are probably more politically-savvy and often tounge-in-cheek than it's big brother, and this doesn't make the album better or worse. In fact, some of the lyrics really do hit a note with me. <br />\\"Boom\\"...<br />I'm walking through your streets<br />Where all your money's earning<BR>Where all your buildings crying<BR>And clueless neckties working<BR>Revolving fake lawn houses<BR>Housing all your fears<BR>Desensitized by T.V.<BR>Overbearing advertising<BR>God of consumers<BR>And all your crooked pictures looking good<BR>Mirrors filtering information through the public eye<BR>Designed for profit sharing<BR>Your neighbor, what a guy<br />It's eerie how accurate Serge's lyrics can often be. Some may claim them to be pretentious, but coming frommiddle-upper class suburbia, they can paint a perfectly honest picture of Life in many respects. Even when he screams \\"...you pig!\\" it comes across as both convincing and emotional.<br />You've still got the power chords slugging you in the face, a lot of intense rhythm and some melodies that'll stick in your head for long after you're done listening (\\"Innervision\\" with me currently). All in all, it's a powerful, FUN listen that doesn't take itself too seriously whilst still maintaining meaning. The last half might run out of fumes a bit early, but I forgive the guys.<br />Oh yeah... I wonder if Serge watches TV. ;)<br />I originally rated this 3 stars, but based on the fact that i CANNOT STOP LISTENING TO IT, I've bumped it up for a 4.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I can't count the exact number of days that I sat here thinking, &quot;Why would any one mail a keyboard to William Golding, the master of all Cast Away type novels, the author of Lord of the Flies and Pincher Martin?&quot;. Finally I decided to open the package and start it up. &quot;Prints out on index cards&quot;, the box states, &quot;Made in China&quot;. The grandpappy of all Cast Away scenarios was Gulliver's Travels, but the similarity ends shortly in the modern Cast Away. Kon Tiki was Thor Heyerdahl's search to find the specific Pacific origins of Polynesian culture. There are no Polynesians in Cast Away, but there is a raft. Blue Lagoon was a film similar to this but set in the 1800's, and the characters had someone to talk to. Gilligan's Island involved a group of Cast Away types and was successful for years, yet too amusing to believe, except for Thurston Howell the Third. In Golding's novel Lord of the Flies, a group of children grows up lost on an island, and become very primitive before mankind finds them. Pincher Martin is the movie and novel of Golding's that Cast Away resembles most. In fact Cast Away could have been a technicolor remake of that saga, but maybe Tom Hanks couldn't do the British accent required for Christopher Hadley Martin, lost sailor, in the north Atlantic, in World War Two. There are no fancy conscience wrenching flash backs in Cast Away, as in Pincher Martin, but the original plane crash should not be missed by those who love the sense that the movie screen is going to swallow you up and destroy you along with the movie's hero. The one saving grace of Cast Away not being a Golding remake is that the film states the problem of being stranded alone in the beautiful south Pacific with a low budget approach that lets the horror of Edgar Allen Poe lean into the front row and say, &quot;You, dear audience, have room now, without all the intellectual posturing of a brain bending novel in front of you, to personally join our hapless victim of modern disaster and the failure of proficiency in transit, an airplane crash.&quot; Here you are, seeing what countless short stories and novels have used as a trite easy plot, but Cast Away isn't going to preach to you. This film is also here to say, &quot;Even you can afford to learn what this extreme loser is learning, survive, and like it, because what you don't see here is the hell that awaits the ultimate loser, the wicked and the damned.&quot; Quote within a quote? Sure why not? There's no one else out here to talk to. Except some trees, a lost keyboard, a volleyball, myself, deep inside, where I had better keep me before I really go nuts and admit to telepathic powers that could signal travelling cannibals to the island, my kingdom, our kingdom, the land of myself, and Gulliver, and Gilligan, but he's not here, just some old spooks, and mister flashlight, and Wilson Volleyball. Don't mind the spooks, you might sense but don't see here either. There's an old pirate, a lost balloonist, a couple of navy deserters, a native in a grass skirt, really old and just standing there watching me trying to escape. &quot;You'll escape&quot;, they're saying, &quot;Don't photograph us. The after life contains a message out here. There is no escape ultimately. Just try to relax.&quot; I wonder how they communicate those thoughts without laughing out loud. They might not even be talking to me. I had better grab my volleyball and surf raft and get back to what modern life calls civilisation. Now that's what I call escape. Let's all do this again, until we get it right.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld, for those not in the know, is a Vampires vs. Werewolves (Lycans) movie. My first initial reaction to it when I saw the previews on TV were, &quot;Oh no! Not another Matrix ripoff!&quot;<br />The scene where Kate Beckinsale's character shoots through the floor to drop down to the floor below it, as well as the shoot out in the subway, scream &quot;Matrix&quot;. The sad thing is that those two scenes alone almost do an injustice to the movie for those that have not truely given it a chance. Other than those two scenes, the movie itself is NOT a Matrix ripoff. It only borrows some ideas from the Matrix series.<br />I'm glad that I finally went and purchased the DVD and watched the movie. It was refreshing and a twist in the plot had me going.<br />Underworld has a story line to it, unlike Matrix Reloaded (which I still enjoyed, BTW). Rather than throwing in a lot of action and trying to weave a story into it, this movie has a story with the action supporting the story. The darkness of the sets helps to bring out the broodishness of the war between the two factions. In many respects, it reminded me of The Crow and the first two Batman movies, giving a Gothic feel to it, which sets the tone for the movie.<br />For fans looking for a fast-paced action movie, you might want to look elsewhere. This movie is more about a war between two factions that hate each other. At first, you are given the belief that there is no known reason for the war except that there is an extreme hatred between Vampires and Lycans, but clues are given as the movie advances and the real reason will eventually be revealed, and for me, it was out of left field! Who do you root for? The Vamps or the Lycans? You decide!<br />The only problem I have is that the Vampires cast reflections! For me, that is such an integral part of the Vampire lore, but I can overlook it in this case. Also, it might seem weird with Vampires and Lycans shooting at each other, but the ammunition is not your standard grade of ammo. It's actually ingenious with the types of ammo they came up with for this movie. Why shouldn't the Vampires and Lycans be with the times? Better to use the technology at hand I say to give yourself an advantage. Besides, this ISN'T Buffy the Vampire Slayer, another one of my favorites (the TV series, that is!)<br />The ending seems to leave room for a sequel. However, I think it might be best left alone and we are left to just wonder what is to become of the war between the Vampires and the Lycans.rd grade of ammo.

B0000844IT|5.0|How do you make a great thing better...Director's Cut.  I've seen Army of Darkness countless times (100+...when you live with six other guys in college, the movie is sort of on...all the time)...but when I viewed the Director's cut for the first time...blessed images danced across my as yet virgin eyes and new one-liners exploded from my speakers-I nearly wept with joy.  This is a must have DVD set.  I understand that you, much like myself, probably already own the movie on tape (X2), DVD, div-X, and possibly even Laser Disc.  But know now that you will not regret this purchase.<br />Shop smart guys, shop S Mart.
1577311523|5.0|Awe man... This is an awesomely inspiring book on living in the present moment! The cool thing about this living in the present moment stuff is that if you think, &quot;how do I experience this?&quot;, you've already lost it. It's crazy! It rocks to understand that the great people in the world can be in this state under the crappiest circumstances. But these great people were not just born that way, they grew into it. And maybe you and I can some day too! &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato is an all-out wicked book on how some of us end up becoming like that. It's all in how our mind develops! It's part of evolution! It's a long-term job of whoever is up there man! Dude! Read this stuff and be inspired! After all, this is what the world has to offer, FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK!
0061015725|3.0|Overall, Prey was a good read.  I found the first half of the book slow, as I am not a computer programmer, nor do I want to be, but I know enough about computers that some of the stuff is exagerated.  I also did not care for the endless evolution theories, as even as Crichton points out, 150 years in evolution proved us to be mostly wrong.  So why would modern theories be any better?  He just bases a large portion of his book on something I find very controversial and still unproven.<br />The second half of the book, when the swarms are finally introduced, is much better.  Still plagued by evolution and distributred processing theories, but non-the-less gripping.  A bit predictable, the 'clues' about what will happen are very obvious.<br />I thought it was worth my time, as I am a huge Crichton fan.  His other works, however, are much better in my opinion.  But the circumstances were very original!  Whooda thunk - killer nano-bots!
B00005JMCN|4.0|The only negative criticism here is that this movie is very predictable.  Does anyone really think Seabiscuit is going to lose any of the close races he is in?  There were others, but I won't nitpick such a finely made film.  It is finely made.  It is heartfelt, and emotional, and the quality of the production is top-notch.  This just isn't the masterpiece that so many people have told me.  I have an aunt who asked me if I had seen this movie.  When I told her &quot;no, not yet&quot; she gasped and was at a loss for words to describe what she apparently thought was one of the greatest films she had ever seen.  While it is a good film, and some might see it as flawless and beautiful, it is not perfect.  I could name 5 films from last year that I thought were better than this one.  Could anyone really say this is on the same level as &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; or &quot;The Pirates of the Carribean&quot;?  However, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is worth seeing. Perhaps more than once.
0767840135|5.0|Fantastic show.  Two thumbs up all around.  Every act and performer is phenomenal.  No weak links here.  The music is as bizarre and errie as it is brillant.  You feel like you are in a world created by Salvadore Dali when put together with the costumes and makeup.  This show takes you into a dream like trance with some of the most athletic and visual pleasing acts that you have ever seen.  There is definitely some spectactular shows and this one has to be the sexiest of ones which I have viewed.  Mystere, O, Allegria and Saltimbatico (Saltimbaticao is weak).  Wow.  A must own.
B000002B7S|5.0|Let´s face it, Bark At The Moon is, right next to The Ultimate Sin, considered to be Ozzy´s weakest achievement to date. I personally can´t see the reason behind that statement, as Bark At The Moon is one of Ozzys most fast-paced-rock-like album I´ve ever heard. <br />In fact, I remember I hated Ozzy long ago, actually thinking that songs like Crazy Train and Mama Im Coming Home were boring, until I heard Bark... which I thought was harder and faster than anything I used to call &quot;Heavy&quot; and immediately started to listen to it at the loudest volume possible. I would later buy it, listen to all the songs in it, and give the others ozzman albums a chance. I was amazed how this album turned out to be quite different from the average heavy rockers you can buy everywhere, with both melodic both heavy songs (featuring keyboards to add a goth atmosphere to the background) and how it never really became popular. True, this album really wasnt something the fans were expecting to hear later, but thats because Ozzy had to move on due to circunstances (Randys death for instance) while the fans kept theyre Randy Rhoads fanatism. Wheter or not this album reaches Ozzys standards its a good thing to discuss, however one way or the other this album is still pretty famous in the &quot;metal-community&quot;, (more than many fans think) and there is a reason for that.<br /> Unfortenately, Ozzy himself doesn´t see this album with very good eyes nowadays (the madman cant stand an album which he isnt praised for right at its release) and decided to mix it up a little to try and make this album a little more &quot;suitable&quot; for his taste. The result is the 2002 re-mixed album with sometimes louder sometimes lower keyboards on the songs, ecoes and some guitars riff out and well, 50% percent of the quality out.If you have have both versions, pay attention and notice that some of the songs have been slow-paced in the re-mixed version. <br />Fortunately I already had an oldversion of that album (even older than the 1995 remastered series) and knew how it was really meant to sound like. I bought the 2002-version just because of the bonus tracks and boy was I dissapointed, read-out why:<br />     Bark At The Moon:Arrrrrgh, this version sucks, the laugh ecoes are out, so are all the others ecoes, you can barely tell the keyboards are playing, Jakes guitar sounds noisy instead of melodic, and you can tell Ozzys voice been tempered with something. The song that got me into Ozzy the first place turned to trash.<br />     You´re No Different: Unlike the previous version, this one actually makes it to the end of the song (it was cut for some reason in the earlier albums) Also, this is one of the songs that Ozzy has made slower, but it actually seems to work :O. So, you say, this version was meant to be better than the previous ones right? yes, it was meant to be. But Ozzy did also cut the ecoes here (they were really cool :( ) and the keyboard is louder than all other instruments (guitars,drums,bass) You cant tell if you have a good sound device... but try and listen to this version in a disc-man or weak radio and you´ll see how crappy the keyboards make the song look like. crappy.<br />     Now You See It (Now You Don´t):<BR>     Now this song isnt really excelent at first place, but it is worst in this 2002 version, some keyboard acts are out and so are guitars riff, oh yeah this song was made slower too.<br />     Rock'n'Roll Rebel: This song didn´t got slower at all, but dozens of Jakes guitar riffs are out (not just the one in the start), and I think Ozzys voice been tempered here as well.<br />     Centre Of Eternity: This one is the easiest to tell the difference so I wont even bother... let me just say this a classic turned into bad-performed-tempered thing.<br />     So Tired: Ozzys voice at the beginning of the song is a little higher in the previous albums, also I think some ecoes were removed out of this song.<br />     Slow Down: The only song that didn´t suffer any change at all! I´ve listened to it time and time again and i can tell its the same... too bad its not much of a song either, its good but, Ozzy should have left a better song intact. dammit &gt;:(<br />     Waiting For Darkness:Too high keyboards, too many riffs taken away, Ozzys voice is tempered again and this song got slower too... man I cant stand all these changes, this was another personal favorite of mine, and yet, its been turned to trash too.<br />     Spiders In The Night: Actually I never heard the version on the 1995 version, but I woudnt be surprised if its better than this one.<br />     One Up The B-Side: This one we will never be able to tell, but by the way this thing sounds alike the rest of the album, id pretty much bet that at least Ozzys voice got tempered.<br />Notice that when I say &quot;Tempered&quot; I mean that without all those ecoes, Ozzy probably tried to better his voice a little with some mixing device among the many they got down at Epic.<BR>So the final question, why 5 stars if so much critics? well I´ve just listened to both Bark At the Moon versions and, though this was meant to be the &quot;clean&quot; versions review, I just had to let it out, so the stars are for the &quot;clean&quot; album not the 2002 &quot;horrible mistake&quot;. Which by the way, if you want to really catch the good Bark... album, the one that got famous, you better hurry, cause sooner or later they will be all depleted, and will have to stand this &quot;tempered&quot; version &lt;:(
0393057658|5.0|I avoided this book for a while because I had heard that Billy Bease came off as very arrogant.  I had even heard that some general managers in baseball this past year were not going to trade with him because of the way he was presented in Moneyball.  I didn't feel that the depiction of Beane was negative.  He is a driven guy who has basically changed baseball-for the good of the game.  He has proved that a team with lesser financial resources can compete.  This book can be used to relate to any area of business or life in general.  Be smart, be prudent, and think and you can be successful although the odds seem to be against you.  I appreciated the discussion of the postseason failings of the team.  Although, I do feel that this will even out eventually.  This team (pitching in particular) is too good to not succeed on a grander scale.  The story of sabermetricians may have been the best part.  Amazing how a bunch of numbers guys can change a sport.  An awesome book about an awesome guy.  Beane deserves to be in the hall of fame one day.
B00009RDG9|2.0|I live right across the river from where this movie was shot and in that regard I enjoyed all the referrences to places I know and have been.  But there are so many plot holes in this movie it was hard for me to recommend it highly.  Both lead characters should have died long before the end of the movie.  I suppose super soldiers have incredible endurance and twice as much blood as most people.  Benicio Del Toro should have drowned when he jumped into the Columbia River.  If the impact didn't kill him the current would have pulled him down.  I know this river personally and the current is incredibly strong.  Tommy Lee Jones character said Benicio could &quot;swim like a fish&quot; but I doubt he could breath like one.  Also, Benicio is being chased by agents and cops so what does he do, he builds a fire and fashions a blade.  Good idea.  Tommy gets stabbed in the leg by a long, sharp stick which apparently only made him angry because he didn't bleed from that wound thereafter. Then he falls onto some rocks on his way down a large waterfall, then pulls himself out and shortly gets into a knife fight with Benicio. It is only near the end that the editing and plot take a back seat to reality.  Am I supposed to believe that Benicio set an elaborate trap of two logs that come smashing together a la &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;?  I realize that he isn't your normal human soldier but hiding might have been a smarter plan.  He is able to blend with the shadows, yes?  Then there is the scene where Tommy is just dripping with water, and only moments later he is completely dry.  Anyway...it wasn't a complete waste of time.  In fact, the fight sequences were enjoyable, albeit bloody.  And there were some other scenes that were fairly well done.  It just didn't make much sense.  Blood-loss usually causes people to feint or go into shock.  I've even heard that some people die from it.  It's true.  I think I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
B0000630BT|2.0|The fact that there are no 3-star reviews should tell you something - you will either love this record or hate it - the last album with Rob Halford on lead vocals.  As a Priest fan since 1978 (yes, that is a \\"7\\"), I would say that if you liked 'Stained Glass' (1978) (another overrated Priest record), then you will probably like this.<br />The only songs I ever liked from that record were \\"Exciter\\" and \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\", and similarly, I have concluded that there are only two worthy tunes on here - \\"Painkiller\\" and \\"A Touch of Evil\\".  While much is made of the musicianship (particularly, of new drummer Scott Travis), speed does not always translate into effective music.  In any case, the lyrics are hopelessly banal.  Whereas previous records were generally limited to just three lyrical topics ((1) mythical beings in post-apocoalyptic scenerios; (2) rough sex; and (3) what a great band JP is), this one is limited to just one.  And while the lyrics are laughable, long gone is the INTENTIONAL sense of humor (e.g., \\"Eat Me Alive\\" from 'Defenders of the Faith' (1984) or \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" from 'Ram It Down' (1988))?  In a way, Priest sold out, spending too much time folding to the Pantera/Slayer-style speed metal trend that was the \\"sincere\\" heavy metal sub-genre in 1990 and not enough time on the lyrics.  What is most ironic is that only one year later, the consumate speed metal band, Metallica, would assume a sound that was more like classic Judas Priest and cash in to tune of 10+ million records.<br />If you are a new fan, I recommend cutting your teeth on these classics (in order):  (1) 'Screaming for Vengeance' (1982); (2) 'Unleashed in the East' (1979); and (3) 'British Steel' (1980).
B00000J7S8|2.0|Quando le note critiche di un disco sono sostituite da suadenti immagini di una ragazzotta bionda, fotografata sulle spiagge coralline di Guadalupe, pu sorgere il dubbio che la registrazione sia priva di spessore.

B000002WYT|5.0|If I were to rank the DMB albums, Crash would come in third (#1 - Before These Crowded Streets, #2 - Lillywhite Sessions).  That should by no means to be taken to imply that this is not an excellent CD, but most of the songs on this CD have to experienced live to be truely appreciated.  Having said that, the production and performances on this CD are top notch, and my favorite song of all time (#41) is contained on this album.  So Much to Say, Too Much, Say Goodbye, Drive In Drive Out, and especially Two Step are always highlights of any live DMB show, and can be found on their live albums as well.  Still, the studio versions are worthy of 5 stars!!
B000002ORL|5.0|First seeing the movie when I was ten, I didn't realize what I know and appreciate now: that the voices and music for JCS depict a time when people in our society were trying to look at life in different ways.  We moved from hippees to Disco, we moved from &quot;Non-White&quot; to Multicultural. Thirty years ago, Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice helped to shape how we must live:  to look at things in a different light, explore new avenues, embrace the joy and passion of a story.<BR>    This isn't the typical Passion story, it's seen through the eyes of Judas.  Yet, isn't that what Weber and Rice wanted us to do, walk in someone else's shoes and see another side- to someoneelse's truth. He didn't say that, but the movie, music and lyrics move us to explore for ourselves.
B000002TPS|5.0|In his pursuit to make Metallica a Number-two-thrash band, Dave Mustaine seemed to overlook the fact that by 1994 neither Metallica, nor his own band had any classic thrash left in their sound.<br />If I had to choose 1 word to characterize this record, that would be &quot;proffessional&quot;. Like those proffessionals who come in, inspect the object (audience), set goals (to please audience), write business-plans (pleasing songs), execute them precisely, grab their cash and leave. This is exactly what Megadeth did here.<br />I don't want to show disrespect to this album, because I like most of its songs, but the fact must be recognized, that from that moment on this was another Megadeth. Having only the name in common with the band that released the groundbreaking &quot;Peace Sells...&quot; or the inspired &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;. The sound here is calculated to the note, but it's done so well, that it caught me, among thousands of other fans.<br />Several tracks are definite filler here, like &quot;Elysian Fields&quot;, &quot;Killing Road&quot; and the cheesy &quot;Blood of Heroes&quot;. While other numbers are really memorable, like the title track, &quot;A Tout le Monde&quot;, &quot;Family Tree&quot; and an attempt at &quot;back to the roots&quot; - &quot;Victory&quot;. I won't say anything about musicianship, because it's veru good, just like it was always expected from this line-up.<br />I'm still biased favourably towards Megadeth, so I give this album 5 stars. While only 4 would really make justice. Choose for yourself.
B00006J3WH|5.0|'Once More With Feeling' was one of the first episodes of the show I ever saw, and I was anticipating it as much as any life-long Buffy fan would, and when it aired, it was wonderfully magnificent.  Then I heard they were releasing a soundtrack for it and I bought it the day it came out.  The songs are very catchy, and I always end up singing them during classes, even if I don't mean to.  I love them all, but the ones that really stick out are 'Under Your Spell' sung by Tara (Amber Benson), 'The Parking Ticket Song' sung wonderfully by Marti Noxon, 'Rest In Peace' by Spike (James Marsters, whose band, Ghost of the Robot are also very good), and Sweet's (Hinton Battle) songs.  I do miss the dialogue, it really helps some of the songs, but I'll just get it when season 6 comes out on DVD.  I really love the scores at the end, especially track 20, from the season 4 finale, 'Restless'.  They help make the CD so much better.  Plus, it's always great to hear Joss Whedon sing; I got a few good laughs out of that.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Dave Mustaine has always had this little intention to top his former mates from &quot;Metallica&quot;. This intention is what finally killed Megadeth, to my mind, and this record was the 1st on Megadeth's way down.<br />Yet, this record is excellent. While being more simple musically, with more accessible melodics and catchier choruses, stil the quality of songs is very high, and band members play their part with highest professionalism. As always, Marty Friedman shines throughout the record with his lightning-fast guitar solos.<BR>Somehow, Dave Mustaine managed to please fans of the original Megadeth, at the same time attracting more mainstream audience. While not as exceptionally perfect as &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, this record is still a very good buy, and highly recommended as a rare example of a successful transition of traditional thrash into the 90's alternative-driven metal-stage.<BR>And this is also the last Megadeth truly great album.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Let's forget about all the crazy(mostly useless)publicity stunts Spears had committed.That's not including the marriage that never was,probably the dumbest thing she's done. You need to calm down,girl.<BR>      Okay,now,her music.She has gotten better artistically,but she's kinda slow at growing into that whole real musical artist thing. She's still you,kinda artificial.This CD is pretty damn hot.The music is probably the best out there today; pop-funk, pop-reggae, southern hip-hop, trance/techno-dance--its ALL HERE. It's just Britney's voice which is about to dissappear on some tracks.Like R.Kelly's OUTRAGEOUS,great beats and chorus is tite,but but here voice gets crappy near the end of the song. (I'VE GOT THAT)BOOM BOOM is a really annoying song,its for Beyonce.YingYang Twins are better off with Lil'Jon. TOUCH OF MY HAND is a quite impressive track,actually its a beautiful song ANother nice ballad is te dancable BREATHE ON ME,really nice,Britneys voice on these two songs is amazing comparable to Janet Jackson. The most dancable songs are SHOWDOWN, THE HOOK UP, the girly but fun digital-rapping BRAVE NEW GIRL, and<BR>TOXIC is a short,fun,over-produced uptempo pop track. EARLY MORNIN is actually a really nice and important Spears song one you get used to it,she sounds like little Madonna in it.Good job Moby. The Matrixs' SHADOW is also a nice ballad,reminds me of Avril's I'M WITH YOU,not the voices! All that's missing is the best stuff from the amazingly-original Neptunes. I cant believe she didn't work with Pharrell and Chad this time!!  Other all she needs is to improve her vocals,sometimes she sounds yucky and scratchy. Other times and on most songs, her voice is strong and sounds like Janet at her best. Britney deserves some credit,this cd is dancable,sultry and she's improving big time. I just wish there were more songs and that they were longer. Otherwise, keep up the amazing work Brit.
B000002IOY|5.0|Overkill knocked me off my feet with this one. Yes, they always were heavy, hateful and powerful. But never were they THIS heavy as hell.<BR>Having obvious Black Sabbath influenceson this record, Overkill managed to improve their dry sound drastically. The rhythm section is tight, and the bass-guitar adds head-crushing heaviness. The guitars are precise and sharp. The vocals are deeper than before, yet still instantly recognizable.<br />The tracks selection is excellent and varied, with not a single one being filler. Highlights are the slow-to-a-crawl and heavy &quot;Skullcrusher&quot;, the fast &quot;Birth of Tension&quot;, epic-sounding &quot;Who Tends the Fire&quot;, and the surprizing melodic, almost balladesque &quot;The Years of Decay&quot;<br />This is definitely Overkill's finest hour, and is a worthy purchase to almost any metalhead.
0142004235|4.0|East of Eden draws from the biblical story of Cain and Abel, reliving the age-old theme of good versus evil.  The similarities between the brothers in this novel and the biblical brothers are numerous.  First, note the \\"C\\" in Cain, Charles and Cal, and the \\"A\\" in Abel, Adam and Aron.  The fathers in the book represent God and Cathy (Kate) plays a very convincing Satan.<BR>   In Genesis Chapter four, Cain and Abel both offer gifts to God, and Abel's is respected and accepted while Cain's is not.  Similarly, in East of Eden, Charles gives his father a knife and Adam gives him a puppy; Cyrus loves the puppy but does not use the knife.  <BR>   Years later, Cal and Aron are in the same situation with their father, Adam.  Adam wants nothing more than the gift of pride that Aron gives him through his scholarly endeavors, and rejects the gift of money from Cal.  There are many similarities between Cal, Charles and Cain, but also one major distinction that sets Cal apart from the other two evil characters.  Cal recognizes the malevolence in himself and hates it.  On that basis, a part of him is as good as Aron, Adam, and Abel.  In the end, Cal is redeemed because he can bring himself to ask for forgiveness.
B000002UUX|5.0|By the time this album was released back in 1990, I've been a 'Deth fan for 2 years. And yet my extremely high expectations for &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; were topped!<BR>This record is the 1st of Megadeth's constant and best line-up, consisting of founders Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson, with newly signed guitar genious Marty Friedman and potent drummer Nick Menza. I don't know what sparks flew between these guys, but all of a sudden everything worked just right. There's not a single wrong second on this CD, all the tracks are classics, and all are among the best Megadeth has ever released. This is highly technical thrash, with lots of shredding solos, clever and intricate basslines and excellent drumming. Dave's vocals, while not the best around, work here just fine and suite the mood of the music.<br />Songs vary from heavy and relatively mid-tempo &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; to melodic speed-fests &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; to Megadeth trade-mark thrash-n-roll &quot;Poison Was the Cure&quot; to a very peculiar number &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot;. In fact, every song has to be mentioned, because the diversity of this album is something very hard to surpass.<br />This is Megadeth's absolutely best, and one of the better thrash-metal you can get your hands on.
076790592X|3.0|never has a book left me feeling conflicted about its main character;  true, this book does inspire one to prioritize what really is important in life--and for that, I have grown.  But I find the book to be a tad morbid. In addition, Morrie seems to be more focused on friends and family, but rarely is his wife and their relationship mentioned in his last days.  Anyway, I am left undecided about this one, but do recommend reading it because life is so short and it really isn't about material posessions or career.
B000001C6M|3.0|I know I'll dissonate to the majority of reviewers here.<BR>Yes, this is one of the 1st documented thrash-metal founding records. Yes, when I first heard it back in 1989, I was immensely impressed. Yes this is the raw sound, unique in a way.<br />But as time flew by, now, 20 years since its release, initial impression has faded away, and in my eyes it's not as interesting as it seemed then. Main reasons for this fact are (1) All band members do not sound very proffessional here yet, and would dramatically improve their performance even the following year, (2) this was just a template for brutal satanic thrash, that would later be developed into full glory in more deserving records, and (3) most of the songs here have countless live versions which are by far better than here in the studio.<br />Thus, recognizing the importance of this album, I give it only 3 stars. The real Slayer started the next year, with &quot;Haunting the Chapel&quot; EP.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|well this cd finnaly had a differnt feel to it compared to her other albu,bs, ya she cant realy sing but the beats are pretty cool, def. music you cna dance to and get ya energetic
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Now this is how to do a comic book movie!!! This film will satistfy almost any movie fan, and leave them wanting more. It's got tons of action, interesting characters, a good storyline and might even make you shead a tear or two. What more can you ask for from a summer blockbuster (even though it came out in May) movie?<br />I enjoyed the first X-Men quite a bit. While it wasn't the best movie I had seen, it was definately the best comic book movie I have seen since the original Superman. Like many others, I was eagerly awaiting a sequal. And it does not disappoint. Not much has changed from the last movie. The focus of the film is still how humans can't accept mutants breathing the same air as them, so they try to wipe them out. X2 just has a different villain &amp; goes about it a different way.<br />The opening scenes of this movie are amazing. They involve the new mutant, Nightcrawler, trying to asassinate the president of the United States. It definately shows off his mutant powers of teleportation, and the special effects will blow your mind. After a great opening like that, you are automatically hooked.<br />The movie then goes with Wolverine as he goes back to the site where he was &quot;made&quot;, so to speak. All he finds is rubble of, what used to be, a scientific lab. He then returns to the X-Men mansion. There you get re-introduced to all of the X-men and some new ones. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm, Rogue &amp; all the rest are here. Iceman plays a much larger role in this picture. He is now Rogue's boyfriend. You are also introduced to a new X-man named Pyro. He is around the same age as Iceman &amp; Rogue, but way more unstable and likes to show off his powers too much for Professor Xavier's liking. <br />After hearing of Nightcrawler's asassination attempt on the president, Xavier sends Jean Grey &amp; Storm to go find the mutant and bring him back to the mansion. Xavier and Cyclops go visit Magneto, who is now being held prisoner in a plastic cage. Wolverine gets to stay home with the kids &amp; babysit. Due to the assination attempt, the president gives Col. William Stryker the o.k. to raid the X-men mansion in hopes of finding the mutant that attacked him. Stryker has his own agenda, however and wants all mutants wiped off the face of the planet.<br />At that point the story &amp; action picks up quite a bit. Bryan Singer (the director) does a great job of seamlessly blending 3-4 storylines together and they are all going on at once. Stryker (played by Brian Cox) is the villain of the film and is trying to make his own cerebro and use Prof. X to kill every mutant on earth. Wolverine has a long &amp; storied past with Stryker. Which I won't get into (might ruin some plot lines), but you learn the origin of Wolverine. Stryker has been holding Magento prisoner for some time now, and he plans a nice escape and teams with the X-men to try to stop Stryker, or so the X-Men think. To make a long story short, it all comes together in the end and it's a very good storyline. The climax of the film is VERY well done and I will bet you at least shed one tear while watching it. This is how you not only do a comic movie, but any movie. It's well acted, well scripted, &amp; well directed. In some other director's hands, this could have been just another action movie involving comic book characters. Brian Singer brings all togther and makes it what it is. I am hoping they make a third film and bring Singer back to complete a trilogy.<br />The DVD is loaded with special features. And they are all quite good, and not useless like some of the Terminator 3 supplements that I just viewed. There are commentaries, behind the scenes, a making of documentary, 11 featurettes, deleted scenes, and trailers. It's quite a good package and if it wasn't the for the Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers Exended Edition DVD, this might be the best DVD of the year.
0553382179|5.0|I love this book. Check out Flylady.net first to see what you think of the system.  I wasn't sure what to think at first, but her system has changed my life and the lives of countless others. The website gives tons of free information and it's actually useful and entertaining information. I bought the book mostly as a guide to keep me from getting sidetracked and to pick up anything not on the website. Marla Cilley has a great way of empowering you to be your best while not expecting you to be perfect.<br />Thank you, Marla. God Bless you.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I want to begin with 'Underworld' is not for everyone. It is hightly specific for a certain kind of audience. The audience that knows the rules and behaviors of Vampires and Werewolves, because they don't go into detail about that in the movie.  Not everyone will love it, but to those people who love vampire, werewolf, myth movies, (myself included), it was great!!!<br />One of the first to combine the unlikely combinations of Vampires vs. Werewolves ( or Lycon as in the movie ).  The story was true to many beliefs (Vampires are stuck-up upper class, and werewolfs are more savage) and explored a plot line that revolves around inter-species connections.<br />It was fanastic, the movie was very well done, with the color palette being a mix of dark blues, and gloomy atmospheres.  It was something out of movies like 'From Hell' and 'Interview from a Vampire'.  The actors were of course not all that good, but hey, what actors are really good in movies now a days? The heroine, Celine was good for the part in looks, and her counterpart, Micheal was not a bad match either.  They seemed compatable, but not to flashy in the romantic department, which was nice for the action-lovers, but a little lacking for a vampire movie.<br />Whatever you are looking for in this movie, its there and i, along with hopefully many other fans, will be looking for a sequel or two to this mysterious and cryptic story.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I'd have to take the greatest possible exception to some of these negative reviews--&quot;Room On Fire&quot; is much better than their first album. It hasn't caused a &quot;stir&quot; because it doesn't need to. No one really thought (or at least I didn't) that The Strokes were the &quot;next big thing&quot; to begin with--instead what I thought was that it was such a relief to see a decent rock 'n roll band in the mainstream spotlight. And as far as The Strokes standing on the shoulders of their predeccessors, which of the new groups aren't doing the same? Interpol steals from The Psychadelic Furs and Echo and the Bunnymen...The White Stripes steal from...The Pixies and The Sonics...is this where we are in rock when groups cannot create a new style all their own? Well...that doesn't make me a Strokes-hater like a lot of people.  Check out this album--don't be afraid of more &quot;esoteric&quot; (and often elitist-minded musical snobs) giving you the cold shoulder because you like probably the best rock/pop group on the planet right now...it's okay
B0000VCZKM|1.0|Everyone else has already said it, what more can I add? How could you even think about remixing this wonderful soundtrack in 5.1 Dolby AND DTS and then pan & scan it??? Why not just mix it down to mono for pairing with 1.33:1. I have the laserdisc and I guess it's gonna stay that way. Sorry Columbia, you lost my $20 and a lot of others. Well, I guess you'll make up for it with all the mothers of 10 year olds.
0061015725|3.0|Michael Crichton's book, Prey, was quite odd, but that's what you expect from this talented author. The best part about Prey is the fact that the field of nano-biotechnology actually does exist. Therefore, facts are taken and added into the storyline.<BR> While the story itself was quite predictable, the facts that are tied into it make it very intriguing. Not only that, but it's always fun to see your predictions come into play.<BR> If you enjoy Michael Crichton novels, this is probably one worth reading. I don't think it's any match to Timeline, but it is definitely an interesting and enjoyable novel.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is by far, hands down, my favorite Madonna album and how I yearn for the day when Madonna will do another album with William Orbit.  On this work, Madonna blends perfectly spiritual meaningful lyrics with techo beats and succeeds on every level where a lot of other performers/groups who tried the same thing failed.  The self reflective discovery in &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love.&quot;  The danceable pace of &quot;Ray of Light,&quot;  the unrequited love and yearning for another in both &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;To Have and Not to Hold.&quot; The universal messages found in &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; and in &quot;The Power of Goodbye.&quot;<br />I grew up listening to Madonna and yes, I am a big fan.  Still when I first heard this album it was such a departure from the great sugary pop songs that I grew up and danced to that I didn't know what to feel about this work,  I didn't want Madonna to grow up and stretch her artistry. Still as I have grown older and more spiritually aware of the world around me I see what a great album this is and how Madonna really outdid  herself with this album and how I want more of Madonna like this.
0140067477|1.0|This must be the first time I've given a book a rating of one star, but this one REALLY deserves it. I am sickened by the thought that people might read it and think this actually has anything to do with Taoism.<br />After reading this book, one concludes that Taoism means being intolerant, looking down on other people and other ways of living, and judging people. Which, of course, is about as far from Taoism as one can get. Benjamin Hoff writes about what happens when you try to fit round pegs in square holes, yet this is exactly what HE does. He doesn't accept Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger and Owl as they are, instead he describes Owl as `the dried-up Western descendant of the Confucianist Dedicated Scholar' (not the only place in the book where he bashes Confucius and his followers) and `one who studies Knowledge for the sake of Knowledge, and who keeps what he learns to himself or to his own small group, writing pompous and pretentious papers that no one else can understand, rather than working for the Enlightenment of others'. Sounds like accepting everyone as they are, doesn't it?<br />I wanted to give this book two stars - for being another reason to re-read `Winnie-the-Pooh' and for the few popular quotations of Eastern thinkers. However, the author's attempts to write in the simple, yet brilliant style of Milne and failing miserably really is the last straw. <br />Therefore, instead of reading about `Nearsighted Science' etc., just go and re-read `Winnie-the-Pooh'. You'll understand Taoism a hundred times better by doing that (or doing nothing special at all) than by reading `The Tao Of Pooh'.
0385504209|5.0|Suspense/thriller is not my normal genre.  I generally prefer historical fiction, but with all the buzz surrounding The DaVinci Code, I Had topick it up for a test read.  That was on a Friday night.  By Sunday morning, I had gotten only a handful of hours' sleep, had neglected all weekend chores except doing laundy (easily done while reading) and was finished with this incredible thrill ride!<br />It opens with a murder in the Louvre, and the experts have been called in.  Needless to say, sparks fly between them,much as the sparks fly throughout Europe as you fly through the pages of The DaVinci Code.  The search for the Sacred Feminine, the Knights Templar, even the Freemasons all take a place in this outstanding novel.<br />Better not start reading this until Friday.  You won't be back in the real world all weekend.  Trust me.  Buy this, read it and be prepared to pass it along, it seems as though eveyone loves The DaVinci Code.  Follow it up with Angels &amp; Demons for another thrill ride.  Have fun!!
B000001E7V|3.0|The flow of the piece itself expelled alot of talent, and Im sure took alot of time and energy.  Though to completely glorify this album at all, would not be my own doing.  Tricky's work has been compared to Massive Attack and Portishead.  Maybe MA has a flow like Trickys recent work, but cant be even be compared to an album like Portisheads' &quot;Dummy&quot; album.  This album, Maxin-something or another, has alot of work to do. Maybe a good remix, or maybe ten of them, would help.  I only give it three stars, because I couldnt do what he does, but I think Im just in a polite mood tonight. So if you like a good sensual electronic flow, MA and Portishead will have to do you.  Tricky is too wanna-be Deltron3030 mixed with a bad breakbeat/trance album.
B00008EYA5|5.0|A recent letter to the editors of Entertainment Weekly challenged Colin Farrell's ranking on their annual &quot;Power List.&quot; Some guy from Illinois claimed that the Irish heartthrob didn't even have enough power to make him see one of Colin's movies.<br />This person also took swipes at &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;<br />I took that as a challenge--and having sat through BOTH films, have to say that EW was indeed incorrect.<br />They should have put Colin Ferrel at NUMBER ONE on that list!<br />&quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; is rip-roaring, non-stop, pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat action from beginning to end. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since &quot;Minority Report,&quot; which ALSO starred Mr. Farrell.<br />Plus, you get the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson, who adds class to any and every film.<br />If you want to see one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER, get a copy of &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; You'll become an instant Colin Farrell fan!<br />Take THAT, Mr. Letter-Writing-Guy.
B000006045|5.0|A meaningful composure of ecstacy and fluid-like rythym's, this album puts itself in its very own enviroment.  Its emotionally and physically stimulating sound, keeps the blood flowing and your body slightly hypmotized.  Massive Attacks new album &quot;Mezzanine&quot; remains to be sensual, erotic, and delightfully mesmorizing.  A beat only compared to Portisheads work, it takes ahold a new feature in audio development.  Its almost edible...
B000002SE0|5.0|The Amazon-Customer who has already made a fool of himself by writing crap on Callas now shows thaz he has no taste at all! What a horrid comment on the death of probably the most fantastic dramatic tenor of the last fifty years! Nilsson would be ashamed to read such proof of fanatism! Corelli sang roles from Bellini to Verdi and more, he deserves more appreciation.<br />This recording is fabulous! Buy it, you won't regret it!<br />R.I.P. Franco Corelli ~ We love you!
B000002MP2|1.0|Why do the masses discover good music 10 years after it's gone?  Why do they desecrate the graves of those they have never known?  For the sake of profit, the media always chases down the people that never wanted to be part of pop culture and steals their art.  The media takes the art, waters it down, takes the edges off for consumer safety, and then parades it as if were their own.  Its just more torture by the masses to those that try to turn their backs on it all.  First Nirvana, and then Green Day led the masses to a lifestyle they would never understand.<BR>Green Day started out recording for one of the most anti-corporate record labels, Lookout Records, and then recorded for a corporation.  They were part of a sub-culture that hated hippies and then they earned their fame from a concert performance at the revival of Woodstock.  Green Day's success was just as ironic, as it was disgusting.<BR>\\"Dookie\\" was pop punk with extra emphasis on pop.  Punk was an attitude that could be heard in the music, but it didn't come through on this album.  Instead, you find a hip slacker attitude with lyrics about trying to overcome alienation, rather than embracing it.  There's also a celebration of marijuana present in the lyrics, which makes it a type of party album and that has always appealed to the masses who seek mind numbing rather than confronting life.<BR>The music on \\"Dookie\\" has a bouncy, uplifting feeling that could be described as cheesy.  The simplicity of the music is not a bad thing, but the way Green Day plays it is very forgettable.  The sound maybe pleasing the first few times, but the shine becomes dull quickly and then becomes irritating.  \\"Basket Case\\" was put into heavy rotation on MTV and it insantly became everyone's favorite song.  <BR>I remember all the jocks showing up at the punk shows that thought the mosh pit was good football practice and went in to hurt people.  At one time, if a person fell in the mosh pit, other people would pick you up beforeyou even hit the ground.  Now, if you fall in the mosh pit you're sure to get trampled.  Stage diving use to be about trust and fun.  Now it's about the whole \\"look at me\\" thing.  Thanks Green Day, for bringing the masses to the underground.  It's a much better place now.
0316666343|1.0|I opted to read &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; simply because it has received so much attention, being on the best seller's list, being compared to classics such as &quot;To Kill A Mocking Bird&quot;, etc.  I was completely disappointed in the book itself and the fact that it has received so much praise.  While the book does raise some thought provoking questions about death, the whole concept of the book is very dark and for lack of better words, weird.  The only reason I continued to turn the pages until the end was because I wanted to know how it was all going to be tied together and that turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all.  I honestly don't know why I even continued to read it after the first chapter was so graphic in the details of Susie's rape and brutal murder.  I found her heaven to be a very lonely place, not at all like one would hope Heaven to actually be.  And I found Ray's and Ruth's obsession with her death pretty unnatural.  I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone who doesn't care to read about the rape and murder of a child, a disappointing heaven, a sick and twisted killer, and a totally ridiculous ending.  Very disappointing!  A classic, definitely not!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I went to one of Gavin's Concerts and was blown away. Not only was the concert one of the best I've been to in a long time. I got the chance like everyone else that night to say hello to him. He is the most Humble and Ginuine person in this business I have ever met. Thumbs up for this album. Every song is good and not many albums are like that now a days.
0385508417|4.0|Saw this book last year but never got around to reading it. Our Women's Club decided to do a book club sort of meeting this month so picked up a copy and read it this morning. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Mr. Grisham's humor is right up my alley. I laughed aloud several times and cried at the end at a very poignant moment. Seems to me the negative reviews came from readers who either didn't get the point, took it too seriously, or just felt cheated because the story is not a courtroom drama. I thought it was extremely funny and I recognized many of the characters and practices in the &quot;real world&quot;. Kudos Mr. Grisham. When a reader expresses physical emotions from the written word, the writer has succeeded and it's gratifying to see an author branch out from his &quot;niche&quot; from time to time.  Thanks for a very good time!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This CD is the BEST CD i own. I am usually a fan of pop, hip hop, and world music, but this is by far my favorite CD ever. I listen to it constantly on repeat and never get sick of it. Badelt deserves an oscar for this one.. its an AMAZING score.. it makes you happy! It's totally wort buying.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Any criticism of this album for &quot;not being Beck&quot; is not only totally unfounded, but actually ridiculous.  How is Midnight Vultures &quot;Beck&quot; if Mutations is also &quot;Beck?&quot;  Those two albums seem as different to me as any other two you could name, yet both are Beck, and both are brilliant.  As is &quot;Sea Change.&quot;<br />If you don't like it, say so; don't blame it on it 'not being Beck.'  Morons.<br />That said, this album is one of the greatest, most touching pieces of work by any artist, bar none, that I have ever experienced.  The sheer beauty of the background tracks lulls the mind into a reseptive state, and locks it into the spirit of Beck's poignant lyrics.  The pain in his voice, which is uncharacteristically raspy in this presentation, is palpable, and contagious.  Listening to this record is a cathartic experience for both audience and performer.<br />Aside from anything else, the music is beautiful, and filled with emotion.  The arrangements are good.  The lyrics are catchy, yet subtle and thoughtful.  It is everything that makes a good album.<br />Buy it.  You'll be glad you did, once the tears dry.
B00003OSTV|4.0|This 1951 film was based on an 1896 novel, and adapted for modern audiences. It shows the all-powerful and all-corrupt court of the divine emperor Nero. There is a love story between a conquering general and a conquered hostage. There is a new religion being taught among the Roman subjects that is subversive to the Roman way of life. There are the eternal conflicts from the quirks of human personalities. We see Nero's pioneering efforts in urban renewal, opposed by the many who suffer from these policies. [Did the blaze remind Europeans of firestorms and bombings? Did the love story symbolize Europe's conquest? What about the old married couple facing execution?<br />Victims were needed to blame for the fires. Nero decrees the Christians are to blame; this secretive sect must be guilty because they don't adore the Roman gods! A witch hunt follows to capture and punish them, using the barbaric tortures Rome was famous for. No trials are needed since the government said they're guilty. An oppressed population is always ready to oppress a lower-status group since it gives them temporary relief from their own pain and suffering. Wouldn't such spectacles draw a huge audience on television today?<br />Peter Ustinov portrays the emperor as one possessed with growing madness. [Was this his greatest role?] The film really doesn't show the horror of this psychopath (matricide, wife killer, pervert); you have to read the history books. The \\"glory of Rome\\" was all moonshine; it was a slave-owning aristocracy that had to continually expand and attack more countries to capture cheap labor and goods. [Does this remind you of modern times?] The film ends with a popular revolt by the people and General Galba. Nero commits suicide. But General Galba was soon given an early retirement by the Praetorian Guard, and another ruler popped up. Let's hope that \\"it can't happen here\\".
0393312836|5.0|I found this book to be one of my most favorites yet. Though for the some the English slang used will be a bit hard to understand, they will grow to love it. The main picture is something a bit dememented, but interesting nonetheless. It could very well change your views on what society today will label the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad.&quot; The movie doesn't compare to the book, so I suggest you read it now.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Ah, sweet anticipation. That is what I have felt for almost a year before its release. After they released the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING-EXTENDED EDITION I was amazed at what they could do with a bunch of extra scenes. Almost everything they added was for fans of the  books, which I am proud to number as one of.<br />  So obviously I was excited about the TWO TOWERS EXTENDED, especially after seeing the theatrical version.  A beautifully rendered movie, but there was a lot that didn't sit well with me. Much dissapointment. But the extended tied up a lot of loose ends (&amp; loose cuts), pulling the story a lot closer to the book than before, most notably with the new Boromir And Faramir scenes explaning the family dynamics and showing Faramir's true character. And once again there were a lot of new scenes just for the fans. ( did I mention that I'm one of them?)<br />  But still P.J. had a lot to answer for (at least to me) with the changes. And answer he did. The 2 appedix disks ( which I think were brilliant ideas to use, just calling them appendixes makes it feel Tolkien), are again chock full of interviews and info on how the movies were made. But still Pete had better have something to say for himself. This isn't a silly old question of &quot;where's Bombadil?&quot; or &quot;why's the pointy eared lady on Glorifindel's horse?&quot;. No, I want to know why Faramir is a big meany taking them to Osgiliath of all places, and why Gollum looks and acts better than both hobbits he plays next to?!?!<br />  These and many more questions are answered, but it was really awesome to see David Wenham (Faramir) talk about his role. It was cool to see him having never read the books before imerse himself in them, and then reading the script and seeing how different the character was from the one in the book. Realising the fans would not be happy with this, he went to P.J. to see what was up. Now thats what I call integrity.  With some directors that might not go over to well but he did it any way. This is just one of the many examples of how committed cast and crew are to these films, Peter Jackson being among the most committed of them all. It has to be a hard job to fit the whole story into three films, and keep everyone happy.<br />  Getting back to the movie itself, my personal favorite scene is seeing Gandalf fighting the Balrog. An amazing scene that perfecly captures the stunning fall into a pit that had no recorded bottom.<br />  This is a movie that I would highly recomend to anyone who loves a great epic, nad even though this movie deviates from the book more so than the other two I think most fans of the books will enjoy as well.it any way.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This is the best movie by far. Though Ed (David) doesn't seem to exactly get the credit he deserves, he makes up for it. I don't think there is one thing about this movie I don't like. Every character is great. So many good quotes and such a good movie. This is one movie that I don't believe anybody can truly say they don't like.
B00006RINF|4.0|I got this as a Christmas present after asking for Comalies (it was accompanied with all their other releases that I hadn't asked for, too).  It's been in my car for the past few days.  From what I've seen I must be a misfit of sorts because I think AEON is a great, beautiful song.  I don't know what everyone's gripe is about.  (Probably that it's not your standard heavy song... so what.)  Christina's voice is stand out throughout the CD.  Heaven's a Lie is of course their radio single which is what got me interested in them in the first place.  Overall, a very good release... cool CD insert too.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|One note to make: get this movie on DVD to get the full fledge advantage because the action is FAR SUPERIOR than on VHS! Can I say that it is better than the first? It is kind of hard to tell, but it is good. The story takes place in Europe, and there is a super-vampire out there wiping out the orginial vampire, and now Blade (who's real name is Eric) and Whisler are back! Blade, Whisler and the vampires then decide to join forces and take out the super-vampire for good, but this is only temporaly. <BR> The action is good, but like I said, get this movie on DVD and get the full fledge advantage of the action. Good movie though.
0446677450|5.0|I just finished reading &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; and I am very happy with the new views it has given me.  As a college student, it's not too late to begin implementing this books lessons.  If you read into the text and don't just listen to the simple messages, you can really pull a lot out of this book.  I wish I had read it before I left for college... it is a good way to gain a new perspective on your education and life goals.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Ok some people may not like the CD, but it is not bad. A friend got this for me a while back, and yes Fred does say the 'f' word a lot on this album, especially on the second track: 42 'f's on there, believe me I counted. <BR> The album is a more personal experience for Fred as you get deeper into the album, it is good, but not great. The album consists of held up emotion and a lot of cursing, and this is not an album for any little kid to listen to. There are a couple of good tracks; Rollin, Life in the Fast Lane, and the last couple of tracks on the album. This is not Three Dollar Bill Yall with the screaming and mosh pit themes, no. This is a more bring out your lighter and blaze for Fred while he talks about heartbreak or whatever is on his mind kind of album. If you want that feel of Three Dollar Bill Yall, then get that, but if you like something just to mellow out to, then this is a good album to do it too. Some good tracks, but not great.
B000005DQR|5.0|As you've most likely read time and time again, fans of music all over the world have rated DJ Shadow with 5 stars consistently across this board.  I could rave and rant about the depth, complexity, and pure beauty of his genre-breaking and genre-fusing songs, but you've already read about that.  What I will tell you is a personal account of how DJ Shadow's music has given me hope in my darkest hour.  How it has uplifted me from the depths of depression when I felt there was no reason left to go on.  My life had been falling apart uncontrollably and I was constantly at a loss of words as to how depressed and miserable I was down to the very last fiber of my being.  Life was cold, lonely and completely unfair.  I was at the bottom of the gutter.  As almost a last testament and tribute to the horrid life I had led up to that point I decided to let some DJ Shadow flow through my headphones one last time.  There I lay in my bed, completely lost in my ever-increasing haze of darkness when the first few notes of Changeling echoed from the headphones into my ears.  As the music continued I could feel my soul being being touched as emotional waves flowed throughout my body.  How could I end my life when there is such beautiful music in the world?  DJ Shadow has the ability to produce music that reflects the true beauty of that which is human.  His music has allowed to me appreciate beauty in everything and respect the opportunity I have of just being alive and breathing.  Pure bliss is the only way to describe how I feel when I put his albums on.  As long as there are people like DJ Shadow in the world, I want to be here too.
0385504209|3.0|If you're looking for a fast, easy, entertaining read, this book's for you. If you are looking for substance, characterization and plain ole good writing, it's not.<br />I don't know what Dan Brown was trying to accomplish but I felt as if I was reading an Encyclopedia Brown book.<br />Honestly, that's how the chapters ended, each with a fantastical cliffhanger that hampered the book's credibility.<br />Good plot, is all I can say.
B000002L75|5.0|Beth Bessmer completely misses the Blasphemous Rumours message by focussing on the anger instead of the question/message in the song. It is not anti-religious, but the age-old search for meaning. A girl spends time wasting her life away and tries to commit suicide, then finds the &quot;right&quot; path, becomes a devout Christian, and is promptly killed in a car accident. Martin throws out the question in anger as to why life happens this way, and feels he has the right to be pssd off.<br />The album is brittle and dark during the majesty of Stories of Old and Lie to Me, but gets loud and in-your face in People are People and Master and Servant. Blasphemous Rumours conveys anger and confusion; It Doesn't Matter and If You Want depict a sense of hope within hopelessness, while Somebody finds DM in the throngs of a powerful, self-effacing ballad<br />Overall the album winds it's way through it's self-titled theme, &quot;The world we live in and life in general&quot;, and it does so very well and completely apart from anything else out there. In 1984, nobody was doing this stuff the way DM did, if at all, and Some Great Reward personifies their iconoclastic character.<br />Lie to Me and Stories of Old spearhead DM's direction forward from this album. This is a must have for any DM fan, or anyone looking for something different and pioneering.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Although i was not too thrilled about the movie from its theatrical preview, I ended up having to see it with friends.  It was so hilarious.  I did not stop laughing from beginning to the end.  The movie is about 2 older people who find love.  One is a divorcee who has not been out on a date for a very long time and therefore who is out of touch with going out, the other is a womanizer who goes out with women half his age.  Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson have such a chemistry.  I definitely recommend this movie.  If you are looking for a good laugh and a fun movie, this is definitely the one to see.  I ended up taking my parents to see it the very next day!
B00005JM02|5.0|The premise of Finding Nemo is, like many good stories, quite simple: an over-protective, worrying father searching for his prodigal son. In this case, the father happens to be a fish, a clown fish to be precise. As voiced by Albert Brooks, Marlin the clown fish is both a sad and sympathetic figure.<br />When his son, Nemo, is snatched by a scuba diver, Marlin ventures off into the great unknown to rescue him. Along the way he is joined by a blue tang named Dory. While trying to be helpful, Dory is seriously impeded by her lack of short term memory (we're talking Memento for the under 10s here).<br />Together, this unlikely duo brave the perils of the open sea, including sharks, whales and jellyfish. On the verge of despair, Marlin and Dory are picked up by some sea turtles led by Crush, the quintessential surf dude, who points them in the right direction. Through these adventures, Marlin learns a parent's hardest lesson: how to let go of your kids and let them grow up.<br />Finding Nemo has a great deal of heart and is told with much humour. Thankfully, the filmmakers show some respect for their audience, both kids and adults, treating us with a measure of intelligence rarely found in Hollywood `family' fare. All of which makes for a very satisfying movie. This is one you'll watch again and again. Years from now, you'll put it on for the grandkids and still realize how good it is; a timeless classic.
B0000CAQ27|3.0|Being a fan of Pink, I instantly picked up this album. The thing I noticed, though, is that she tries to change direction on every album. And that's not always necessarily a good thing.<br />I'm not saying the album is garbage, but for every good song, there are about two songs that are just weird. For every \\"Trouble\\", there's a \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\" and a \\"Last To Know\\". For every \\"God Is A DJ\\", there's a \\"Tonight's The Night\\" (whose lyrics sound like a weak continuation of \\"Get The Party Started\\") and an \\"Unwind\\". And what is up with that bonus track?<br />Still, there are some other good songs to be found, like \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\". \\"Oh My God\\" is okay, but the rap, supplied by someone named Peaches, will have you saying just that. All in all, this album is uneven. If you want to really, REALLY enjoy Pink, pick up M!ssundaztood if you haven't already.<br />Anthony Rupert

B0000TB01Y|4.0|As a fan of the book, and anything else written by Gregory Maguire, and of musical theater, I was very excited to see this come to Broadway.  Unfortunately, I'm too far away to make it there myself and so I bought the soundtrack.  As with anything, there are things to be excited about and things that were disappointing.  <br />Some of the songs are extremely &quot;run of the mill,&quot; though, at least they are singable.  The lyrics are indded very disappointing, think Wizard of Oz written by Doctor Seuss.  That said, there are enough redeeming characteristics to make this CD worth buying.  First is a fairly talented cast led by two exceptionally talented women, Kristen Chenoweth and Idina Menzel.  Both are excellent vocal actresses with a true sense of style to their singing.  There are also plenty of numbers that make the show worth listening to, &quot;defying gravity,&quot; &quot;For Good,&quot; and &quot;The Wizard and I&quot; being some examples.   And, despite the comic book lyrics, I feel that the message of the book still manage to get across to the audience; look below the surface, the weak have strength, be true to yourself.<br />Though the show may be flawed, I remain a fan and will plan on seeing it live as soon as I get the chance, and recommend that you listen and judge for yourself.

B000002KO3|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this album. A friend of mine had invited me over for a listen immediately following its release. &quot;You gotta hear this!&quot;, he said and he was clearly excited. He skipped the first two songs and started with what I now know to be &quot;The Great Curve&quot;. Before I go any further, let me say that I just read an old review elsewhere on the Net (a professional, editorial review no less) and while the writer gave the album high marks for the most part, he took the time to say that &quot;The Great Curve&quot; was annoying and effectively &quot;garbage&quot;. To anyone investigating this album, let me say that I LOVE the entire work---there are NO bad cuts on it at all. However, &quot;The Great Curve&quot; was the reason I fell in love with this recording. And for a variety of reasons. First of all, very few pieces of modern music employ &quot;polyphonics&quot; (performers singing completely different lyrics simotaneously). This song does it and with a chilling effect that I love. I also like it because it's a very powerful, high-energy song, but not for the purpose of being brash in the anti-establishment style of many hard rock songs. It's tight and controlled and, yet the conga (or bongo) drums fills one with the excitement of a wild chase through the jungle! Frankly, the whole album is probably the most original collection of works that I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Granted, being original doesn't neccessarily make music great. But in this case it IS great! I could sit here and write a book on my praises for each of the tracks on &quot;Remain in Light&quot;, but I'm afraid it would surpass the 1000 word limit imposed here. Besides...Night must fall now, darker...darker. In any case, thanks for letting me state my case for an album I have long obsessed over.

B0000CEB62|5.0|I consider Depeche Mode's 101 to be one of the greatest concert films of all time, up there with &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; and &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;.  I owned the original VHS release (as well as the CD), and had been waiting patiently for this to be released on DVD.  I was not dissapointed.  In addition to relieving the experience with a better sound and quality, you also get some great interviews.  This DVD brought back some great memories of lost high school days.<br />Maybe the nostalgia clouts my review, but I do feel that those reviewers giving this DVD a low rating were not around when the film was first release.  I actually get the feeling some feel it is a brand new release.  The reason why this DVD could not be done in a &quot;One Night in Paris&quot; style is that it was released well over a dozen years before that concert!!! Plus, I find 101 so much more interesting.  You get to see not just the concert (regardless of what the young'ems say, Depeche Mode were at the top of their game during the Music for the Masses tour) but also a glimpse into the lives of devoted DM fans, and just your normal everyday backstage stuff that goes on.<br />Normally, one would not expect &quot;electronic&quot; music to be particularly captivating live.  Play the tape, dance around.  However, Depeche Mode inject a vigor into their live performances that differentiates their live performances from their recorded output.  This film is a great testament to that.
B000002A46|4.0|i do not know or understand how people can slate this CD. Mariah is, was and always will be a legend. you have no right to slate this CD. it is the best CD of 1994. i only recently bought it in November 03 and my Dad owned it in 1994. my Dad was 28 in 1994 and he loved it then. i was 15 when i bought it and i loved it and my brother is 11 and he loves it too. the way Mariah adds her sparkle to O Holy Night sends shivers up my spine. it is not possiuble to slate Mariah Carey!
6301942647|5.0|The ageing creator of classics like Roshomon, Ran, The Seven Samaurai, and Throne of blood, treats us to a tour de force of directorial virtuosity. This visually stunning masterpiece consists of eight dreams with an environmental sub plot. The last of these, The Village of Watermills is one of the most moving pieces of art I have ever encountered. Everything about this film is perfect The costumes the colour balance, the forms and the music. Akira Kurasawa demonstrates why he is one of the greatest artists of all time
B00005JM20|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever. I just could not stop laughing throughout the movie. Rowan Atkinson has done it again. Cant wait for the DVD. Highly recommended for everyone who loves British humour.
6305127689|3.0|The movie &quot;Top Gun,&quot; inspired by Topgun (a.k.a. the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School) air combat maneuvering training that made air combat survivable for fighter pilots over Vietnam and has churned out highly-skilled aviators ever since, had a lot of potential.  But unfortunately, they picked actors that all the teenage girls would get all &quot;ooh-ahh&quot;-ish over and all the guys would think were cool so they could market it to an audience that is generally indifferent toward military aviation, other than saying &quot;hey that's a cool-looking jet.&quot;  The thing that saved this film was the F-14 Tomcat.  Since they didn't use any computer simulations, all the flight scenes were real.  Great air combat scenes, although painting F-5s up with red stars on the tail isn't convincing for those of us who know a little something about aviation!  Heck, they should've just asked to borrow one of those MiGs we bought from the Moldovans!  Wait... that was after this movie.  Anyway, it can be a good movie if you drown out the STUPID fairytale love story.  Tom Cruise is a bad actor, he always has been and always will be and is in the business for the same reason Britney Spears is in the music industry... profitability.  Kilmer is no better either.  They bring people to the theater, and in turn, put $ in the pockets of the filmmakers, so they make a two-hour movie that has a lot of potential but ends up turning into background noise for the ol' midday nap.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album is by far one of the best I've ever heard in my life. I am a huge SOAD fan, and their sophomore effort is definitely great. They debuted in 1998 with their Self Titled album, and 3 years later, the still unknown SOAD came out with Toxicity. It is sheer genius.<BR>1. Prison Song - A strong opener that criticizes the prison system of the US. The opening guitar chords ar eunforgettable as Serj whispers, \\"They're tryin to build a prison.\\"<BR>2. Needles - One of my all-time favorites. A cool intro leads to heavy basses, guitars, and drums. Very awesome.<BR>3. Deer Dance - Intense intro that builds up to a sliding guitar with very fast drumming in the background. AWESOME.<BR>4. Jet Pilot - Underrated brilliance. A Metaphor for jealousy. The songs begins so loud, it'll knock you over. This leads to a quiter, sweet verese.<BR>5. X - Short and sweet. Fast guiatr and drums in the beginning lead to a dominant verse. It's fast and to the point, a favorite of any SOAD fan.<BR>6. Chop Suey! - the first single, and one of the best songs on the album. The start-stop action of the verses is unforgettable and the climax at the end with pianos in the background it godly. <BR>7. Bounce - Funny song about an orgy. It might also be about how sex is becoming more of something one does with anyone (All players no names...) Intense song, with a cool ending.<BR>8. Forest - Great Song with a cool guitar riff playing over the verses. Then the crushing chrous roars in. Its simply awesome.<BR>9. ATWA - Air Trees Water Animals. Soft intro that leads to a chrous that's anything but. Its a roaring classic.<BR>10. Science - awesome intro, verse, and chorus. Towards the end of the song, Arto comes in and plays some really cool stuff. Its a greatr song.<BR>11. Shimmy - a classic made famous by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. It features a sweet intro and fast paced verses and choruses.<BR>12. Toxicity - My personal favorite. The cool intro leads up to the heavy chorus, and then dives back into the verses. The little guitar solo towards the end is godly.<BR>13. Psycho - funny song about being on the road awhile. It has a vicious chorus and at the end, an awesome solo where Daron seems to make the guiatr \\"cry\\"<BR>14. Aerials - the 3rd single. a ballad-esque song that features a classic SOAD riff. It leads up to a vicious chorus at the end.<BR>(Hidden) Arto - An Armernian folk song usually played at funerals. Its pretty cool<br />So basically to warp this thang up I'll say this:<BR>Go Out And Buy This Album Right Now! Then get their 3rd album ....
0446608955|5.0|Nichloas Sparks has done it again, with his book a Walk To Remember. A great book full of romance and comedy, a book filled with mixed emotions. Like most of Sparks other books this one takes place in a small town in North Carolina in 1997. When Landon, a rebel fall in love with Jamie, the preachers daughter. The love beteen the two young lovers grow when Jamie's condition  outs a dent in the relationship.  The book is easy to follow, it like you're one of the chacaters in the story. You'll start to  hate and love some on the characters in the book. Sparks is very descriptive and he leaves out nothing, it like you're really in North Carolina in 1997. The dialog is also very to follow along to, you understand what the charcaters are trying to say and in what way they are saying it. This book is for anyone that has a big heart, who enjoys a  good cry and a good laugh. A walk to Remember is guaranteed to stir up all the emotions you have you won't be able to stop turning the page. Like most of Sparks other books there's a moral, the only way you'll find it is if you read in between the lines. The moral I found was don't judge anyone until you have gotten to know them. Give everyone in your life that you have met and know than them right way don't judge.You'll be very amazeed you they turn out to be. This book is one of New Yorks's best sellers, I read the book  a day I couldn't stop reading.  Everyone with a big heart will enjoy this book, it was meant for all ages. The movie is equally as good but give the book a chance. It's one of my all time favorites let it become one of yours. Read A Walk TO Remember by  Nichloas Sparks, just be preapre for a good cry!
B00001OH7U|5.0|What could I possibly add to the other reviews that point out the greatness of this album?  All I can say is that I regret not checking it out years ago.  It's just flawless.  The epic title track is easily one of the best tracks ever recorded by anyone (the section where he sings, \\"It's too late...to be hateful...\\" just stops me in my tracks).  The rest of the tracks are just about as great, with \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" particularly heartfelt, just gorgeous - I've actually heard Nina Simone's original, and no disrespect, but David's brilliant take is peerless and heartwrenching. The production by Bowie and Harry Maslin is also seamless.  To think this was originally released in 1976 is astonishing - all the more since it sounds absolutely fresh, if not ahead, in 2005.  \\"Low\\" was more innovative (and tends to receive the bulk of \\"best Bowie album\\" praise, probably due to Eno's involvement) and is great in its own right.  But if you want to hear an artist at the very peak of his powers, start here.  A true testament to an artist at the very edge of self-destruction somehow managing to create an amazing work of dark beauty.  One of the true perfect albums.
B0000041TD|5.0|This is my favorite recording of my favorite opera.
B00005MP58|3.0|I loved the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice.  The cast was perfect, it brought the characters I loved from the book alive, and as I wrote in my VHS review, my husband (a military man who wouldn't be caught dead watching a period film about marriage and without guns, grisly deaths, and explosions) sat through this from beginning to end in one sitting.  By the 4th tape, he was yelling at me to pop the next tape in; thus is the power of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  Now, I have my brother- a 16 year old gamer who's never read a piece of classical literature of his own will- to add to that list of people who thought they'd never like it, but in the end, couldn't wait to see if Elizabeth and Darcy get together!    I won't bore with the details, since so many people here have so very deservingly praised this production.  So, instead of reviewing the acting, performances, and the production in general, I'll be contributing a review about the special edition DVD's quality.    Color quality is really lacking.  They aren't unbearable or intolerable, but noticable if you've seen the VHS.  I'm not saying it's just a little noticable, it's very noticable.  The VHS offered a warm and rich viewing of P&P, something I miss while watching the DVD.  It isn't, however, unbearable.  It's not ghastly to the point where people are the same color as the walls (like I've heard some people say).  I'm a P&P nut, so I'll still choose my VHS set over the DVD when I want to just sit down and enjoy P&P- if you love the lovely flushed, warm faces of the VHS and the broadcast (especially the rosey cheeks of Jennifer Ehle), then stick with the VHS.  Everybody looks very fair (read: pale) in the DVD.  Other reviewers aren't kidding when they say colors are washed out.  Lighter colored clothes all sort of blend into the same sort of off-white color.  You see the most drastic gap in quality between the VHS and the DVD when you compare the Bingley sisters and Lady Catherine, who all wear vibrant colored silks.  On the DVD, their clothes are nothing but a shade of what it was on the VHS.    Worse off than the color is the contrast.  Some things (like Darcy's hat when he steps out of the carriage with the Bingleys and Hursts) have no outline or definition if it's dark on dark backgrounds.    The worst, I think, is the blurring.  On this transfer there are a LOT of motion artifacts.  Grass blurs when shots are panning, backgrounds blur even when people move in some shots!  This, I can safely say, was not a problem on the VHS, but it's a big problem on the DVD.  (Again, not ghastly to the point where you can't watch it, but definitely noticable.)    Some people like to nitpick every little problem, and will make a situation out of nothing.  I'm sorry to say the complaints lodged against the special edition DVD release of P&P weren't made by such people, and, rather, made by sound and sane consumers.  But it isn't so bad to the point where it's unwatchable or too detracting (unless you must absolutely have the best, best, best!).    Though I love my (now ever more precious) VHS set, the changing of tapes and rewinding gets tiresome.  What the DVD offered was relief from the opening, the credits, the rewinding, the forwarding, and the getting up and changing of tapes.  The special features were nice, but nothing spectacular.  Only a few secondary characters are interviewed (only Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennett, and perhaps one other secondary character, I believe), but none of the lead characters, which was very, very disappointing.  I was hoping for a glimpse of Jennifer Ehle or the actresses who play Jane, Charlotte, and Lydia out of their period costumes, but, alas, that didn't happen.    I'm glad it's widescreen, I'm glad it's in DVD format, I'm glad I only need to get up and change the disc once, but I'm definitely disappointed with the transfer quality.  I'm waiting for a re-release that will do the series justice.  It's just an awful, awful shame, but still decent enough... for now.  These complaints are all superflous, however, and centered around the quality of the release itself.  The genius of Austen, the charm of the story, and the liveliness and talent of the cast are still fully captured and well presented in this edition... just a teensy bit blurrier and whiter than usual!    EDIT:    ADDED:     DISCUSSION ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE \\"10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION\\" AND THE \\"SPECIAL EDITION.\\"    The 10th Anniversary Edition release of Pride and Prejudice is essentially the same as the original special edition DVD set with a few added extras.  The extras are: The Making of Pride and Prejudice book and an additional third bonus disc.     Now, if you already own the first DVD release, the big question is, \\"is the 10th anniversary edition worth buying?\\"  Well, the only thing that is exclusive to the \\"10th...\\" edition is the third bonus disc, which includes interviews with the producer, composer, and the actors who played Mary Bennett, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Wickham, Mr. Collins, and Mr. Bingley.  There is definitely some good stuff in the interviews, and the bonuses go into a lot of aspects of production, including wardrobe, food, casting, music, and the balls.  Unfortunately, neither of the leads (Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth) participated.       The book, on the other hand, can be purchased separately.  It is titled \\"The Making of Pride and Prejudice,\\" written by Sue Birtwistle and Susie Conklin--Amazon carries it in stock.  Therefore, whether or not the set is worth the repurchase relies entirely upon the appeal of the bonus disc.  Being an avid fan myself, I had to have it (I also have the VHS set).  I don't regret the purchase, myself, because the interviews reveal a lot about backstage antics that occurred during filming.  However, if you're a casual fan who isn't interested in repurchasing the entire movie, it may be better to just consider the book.    This is a fantastic option for people who haven't bought the special edition set (the first DVD release).  I would definitely, definitely recommend the \\"10th...\\" set over the other simply because you get more for your money--the book and bonus disc are a bargain for the extra $12 (the book itself sells for $14!).  The bonuses that were included on the original DVD set are still there on the \\"10th...\\" edition, so you're not missing out on anything.    The cons, however, are:    - The flaws that I discuss in my original review about the first DVD set are still there.  Like I said, this is essentially a re-release of the original DVDs.  Thus, the color and contrast is still inferior to the original VHS release, and the issue with the motion artifacts (blurring) is still present.  Film quality has not improved since the first DVD release.      - Packaging is a problem.  The DVDs are slid into cardboard sleeves, which makes me nervous whenever I slide them out because I'm afraid of scratching them.  For an ultra-special edition, packaging the discs in sleeves seems cheap.  The size of the slipcase is huge compared to other DVD cases, which can be a problem to fit on media shelves.  It basically is the size of the book, which comes tucked inside the slipcase.  However, though it's big, it does make a handsome present.  (I guess what I'm saying is that it's impressive to gift, but potentially annoying if you're the one who has to find a way to store it.)    All in all, I'm not wowed by this set, but I certainly don't regret the purchase; though, I should add that I didn't already have the book.  (However, if you already own the book as well as the first DVD release, I would recommend thinking twice before plunking down the money for, essentially, just the bonus disc.)  This would make a lovely gift for people who don't already own the miniseries, and is definitely the recommended choice for first-time purchasers.
0156027321|1.0|After being exposed to all the hype for some time, I fell to the trap and bought this book. It left me sick at the end with a bad taste in the mouth.<BR>First of all, I found Martel's writing style laborious. I struggled to keep the pages turning. His writing about India is what you would expect from the eye lense of a typical backpacker/hippie who has travelled in India for a few weeks. I hate this superficial arrogance which boasts of having found the essence of India. Even Indians after living a life time in India don't make such tall statements.<BR>The basic story, that of a boy and a tiger surviving together on a life boat after their ship sinks is highly unbelievable to start with. Now I know this is fiction and all make believe. But Martel simply doesn't cut it. I simply can not imagine an Indian family naming their son as Piscine Molitor Patel! Yes that's the name of the boy apparently named so after some stupid swimming pool in Paris! Give me a break!<BR>I simply can not understand why this book got the Booker prize. Anyway after reading another book that got the same prize (God of small things), I suspect to win this prize your book has to have some disgusting things oozing with the ''Bibhatsa rasa''. For example the hints to cannibalism in this book.<BR>Recommendation: Skip it!<BR>PS: I am going to try and find out if I can return this book to the bookstore.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I don't understand how some of you people can say that this is not a good album.  All the songs are original, I personally don't think that anyone else in the world can rap like Eminem.  He has his own style that will never be duplicated...See he even has you in his back pocket just like the rest of the world.  He is on top and he will be for a long time.
B000005RFH|5.0|Here's my review of one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.<BR>1. Black Sabbath- Awesome track about the evils of satanism. 5/5<BR>2. The Wizard- good bluesy track, and great harmonica playing 5/5<BR>3. Behind the Wall of Sleep-This song is awesome, and has cool lyrics that boil down to a story about death 5/5<BR>4. N.I.B-1. This DOES NOT stand for Nativity In Black as stated in another review, it is actually a hint at a nickname Ozzy gave Bill, because his beard looked like a pin nib. Ozzy said this all in the video The Last Supper 2. This is the best song on the album. Awesome lyrics about the devil falling in love. 5/5<BR>5. Evil Woman-cool song 5/5<BR>6. Sleeping Village- cool song, very creepy music 5/5<BR>7. The Warning- alot of people don't like this song cause of the length, but I like it, in fact I like it alot 5/5<BR>Hope my review helps<BR>Bottom Line: BUY THIS ALBUM!!! IT IS WORTH IT!!!
B000000OU6|3.0|This album is not as bad as some might say.  There's blues...it's for the rockin depressed...who's in a dark hole, who's looking to get out, who's got questions...perhaps Slash and Co. were lookin to ease that pain.  To give some sort of light.  This album in my opinion, is great, great sounding and grreat in the way it moves me...so let it move you...close your mind, open your heart and ears..then listen...it's music..let it be music.
B000063DI9|3.0|This album follows Somewhere in Time by being another Somewhere in Time in that, just like it, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is a concept album. Instead of releasing the best songs they could create, they put together the best group of songs, trying to make them larger than they were. This is not to say that there are no great songs here. No way! Infinite Dreams and Clairvoyant are some of my favourites. But songs like Can I Play With Madness and The Evil That Men Do just seem too fitting in the mix. Like they were trying to have them fitting too much instead of letting them take whatever shape they should. I still love listening to this album and I`ve just fallen in love with Seventh Son of a Seventh Son after about 12 years not being too crazy about it. I always found the keyboards ANTI-Maiden but I`m starting to see why it might have been okay to use them in this song particularly. Up the Irons!!
B00005JMFO|3.0|When you go into a Richard Curtis movie (and this time he's director as well) you know exactly what to expect, just as you do when you enter a Hugh Grant movie, and seen as the two names have become somewhat synonymous Love Actually has come under a lot of criticism for predictability.  Attempting a Robert Altman-type tapestry of stories is a brave move, but unfortunately Curtis doesn't pull it off as well as PT Anderson did with Magnolia.<br />This time Grant is (unconvincingly) playing a newly elected Prime Minister who falls in love with his tea-lady Martine McCutcheon, who's perky enthusiasm is past its sell-by-date.  There's also Liam Neesom, trying to teach his 10 year-old to play the drums to catch the eye of his first love, a young girl with the voice of Mariah Carey.  The story is sickly enough, and you can't help but feel Curtis felt this to be prime area for 'hilarous' banter about a 10 year-old in love and the confused but hip step-fater overcoming the death of his wife.  Keira Knightly again proves that she's a rising star in the movies after her stint in Pirate of the Caribbean, an undeniably beautiful screen presence despite her rather wooden acting abilities.  It's a shame then that her story feels like it was lifted straight out of any number of Curtis movies when her husband's best friend decides to tell her he loves her with a set of picture cards on her front doorstep on Christmas Eve.  How perfect is that?  Given the fact that there are such monotonous and sickly moments in the film, it's a big plus that Curtis can still pull off a cracker of a story in other sectors.  Most impressive of the bunch, predictably, is old hand Emma Thompson.  The moment when she realised her husband is having an affair, crying in her room and listening to Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now' is the real heart of the movie, and Alan Rickman is clearly having a ball as the man wanting to relive his youth with his secretary.  Laura Linney gives a fantastically memorable supporting turn as the woman in love with her handsome co-worker but bound to her mentally disabled brother.  The fact that she can turn the comedy (her dance of triumph when she invites her crush inside) and the sadness of her situation proves that she deserves a big movie of her own.  There's also a hilarious subplot involving a geeky lad travelling across to the States convinced that American girls will be crawling over him because of his 'sexy' accent is brilliant.  And of course, Firth is playing Firth only as he knows how in the only truly touching love story of the lot with his hesitant affection for his Portuguese cleaning lady.<br />The fact that Love Actually has so many brilliant sections to it only goes to make the bad parts all the more unfortunate.  Nothing could ever really come close to Four Weddings and a Funeral, but overall this is probably better than Notting Hill and on a par with Bridget Jones's Diary.  Curtis has made the quirky sense of British humour his trademark, and Love Actually was a brave move, which he pulls off in part, and that part's immensely enjoyable.  It's just a shame that there's a fair share of dross to sift through to get to it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I was a ¨heavy metal¨ fan until the ¨Load¨ album from Metallica destroyed everything. I then went ¨alternative¨. Then by mistake I picked up the ¨Accident of Birth¨ album from Dickenson and was blown away. I got his ¨Best of¨ and again, couldn`t wait till more came out. Now I see Dickenson is back with Maiden and POW:<BR>       I`m a Maiden Fan again!!!<br />Dance of Death (if you disregard the cover) is some of the best piece of music put together in a long time (for me anyway). The cover song got me started with its perfect harmony with so many guitars going at once (keyboards too). It`s just great. Then, ¨Gates of Tomorrow¨ became my favourite. This was when Janick Gers blew me away. Then ¨New Frontier¨, ¨Paschendale¨ and ¨Monségur¨ followed. Now, ¨Face in the Sand¨ and the rest of them seem to gain in quality with each listening. ¨Rainmaker¨ is probably my least favourite but I wouldn`t be surprised if it grew on me too.<BR>     This definitely is my favourite Maiden album yet, beating ¨Powerslave¨ which had a few weak songs and even Dickenson`s ¨Accident of Birth¨.<BR>     I hear ¨Brave New World¨ is even better but I`ll have to hear to believe. Till them, up the irons!
0316666343|4.0|For those who think that this is a slick genre thriller or a great whodunit need to look elsewhere. Or if you were like me, stick with it find yourself pleasantly surprised. I picked this up, like most, from strong word of mouth and a moderately original premise. A girl who is brutally killed tells her story watches her friends and family from heaven.<BR>While the premise is violent, the book is not. It's about a family, community and the victim itself impacted by seemingly senseless act of violence. Both sides coping with loss and struggling to let go. I found myself wading through the first seventy five pages or so and I realized two things. This book was not what I thought it was and I really enjoy reading about these characters.<BR> Those who say that this is a classic might be speaking a little to soon. You don't uncork a bottle of wine that has not aged properly. But the book does resonate and I would love to see where this is in fifteen years or so.<BR> Profound and evocative, this is one of the few &quot;popular fiction&quot; novels that live up to it's hype. Just be aware that it's more Thorton Wilder and Russel Banks than John Sanford and Patricia Cornwell. Highly recommended.
0345440900|5.0|I found this book to be very helpful, and it was especially refreshing to see an unbiased perspective on feeding.  Not every woman is able to breastfeed for personal and/or medical reasons (e.g., women with breast cancer), and not every baby takes well to breastfeeding.  I am not sure what kind of formula is available in Canada, but formula in the US has all of the RDA that infants need and is better than ever.  I am not discounting the benefits of breast milk, but women who choose to bottlefeed should be supported as well.  My child has had both breast milk and formula and is thriving, and I was exclusively bottlefed and am none the worse for it.  Also, speaking as someone with a Ph.D. in clinical child psychology, the research is mixed regarding brain development/IQ and breast milk.  Incidentally, there IS research that suggests that depression/stress in mothers does adversely affect infant brain development and attachment, so if a woman is pressured into breastfeeding and is unhappy or stressed as a result or has an extremely difficult time with breastfeeding, the relief brought to mother and child by formula may outweigh the benefits of breastmilk.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Why does this talentless Pepsi vendor still have a recording contract? She cannot hold a candle to her peers such as Christina. The whole packaging of the 'new Britney' is a blatent, desperate attempt to avoid ending up on an episode of VH1's where are they now!
0345440900|5.0|I thought this book was extremely helpful and comforting as a first-time mom.  I have to say I got a little indignant reading Brandon's Mom's write up about the \\"risks associated with formula-feeding.\\"  Not everyone can breastfeed for a variety of reasons (both personal and medical--e.g., women with breast cancer), and formula is a perfectly safe and viable alternative in which infants are provided with the RDA they need.  My baby got both and is thriving, and I was exclusively formula-fed and am none the worse for it.  I thought it was great that Tracy Hogg gave such an unbiased perspective on both types of feeding.<BR>Oh-and by the way, speaking as someone with a Ph.D. in clinical child psychology, the research is definitely mixed regarding breastfed babies having higher IQ's.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Williams does a terrific job in resurrecting and giving great tribute to some smart and fun swing from days gone by.  The numbers vary from toe tapping to slow and mellow, but all of them are worth listening to over and over.  Play this one for a teenager near you and introduce them to the music that entertained earlier generations.<BR>One more note: there is an &quot;Easter egg&quot; on the last track...let it keep playing after the song is finished; it will play nothing for 15 minutes or so, and then you'll hear some studio chatter, including snippets of coversation between Nicole Kidman and Williams.
6305508550|5.0|...and I've never been more ashamed of anything in my whole entire life!<br />I'm a huge Mike Judge fan and lined up (figuratively, this movie didn't do much in the box office) to see it.  To this day I don't know what was wrong with me.  I've now seen it over 30 times (rivaled only by &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; as a comedy)!  And it hasn't worn out at all.  It has all the trappings of a cult classic.<br />Maybe it was funny overload?  Very possible considering how just about every 3 seconds something funny is happening.  I'm like a lunatic evangalist for this movie.
0385484518|5.0|Inciteful, compassionate, profound.  This is a book everyone should read and then pass along to someone they care about.  Also makes a great gift!!
0812550706|5.0|Even the most ADD prone reader will cut through this book like a knife through butter!<br />I didn't plan on doing a review for this, however, in reading what some others had to say I was compelled to register my opinion.  Lets start with what this book is:<br />1.  A very fun read (remember those, so few books are more fun to read than a great movie)!<br />2.  An interesting commentary on human nature (almost like a futuristic Lord of the Flies).<br />3.  A prophetic detail of futuristic warfare.<br />What it's not:<br />1.  Hamlet, Hobbit, or even Snow Crash (it is very approachable by all reader skill levels, both in word and meaning).<br />Just my opinion.<br />Enjoy...
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie inspired me to learn more things about the Titanic. <BR>I think James Cameron did the best work I have seen him do. But the weird thing is that he didn't put any extras. Whatz up with that?But anyways I would really recommend this movie. It is really sad especially when............, well you'll figure out.  Watch the movie and you'll extremely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345457684|5.0|Not satisfied with dominating my time, conversations, and musings while reading it, it's been 3 months since I finished this book and I'm still thinking about it all the time.  WARNING: the hangover from this book is extreme!<br />A murder mystery set in an age when death is largely optional, this book completely reworked my thinking as it relates to murder and mortality.  There is enough information out there on the content of this book so I won't delve any deeper into that.  I will say however that this book is my favorite piece of Science Fiction since Snow Crash.  I look very forward to the sequel!<br />Just my opinion.  Hope it helps.<br />Enjoy...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't get to see too many episodes on TV, maybe three, and I almost wish that I did see them now as to improve their ratings.  Watching these DVDs I enjoy them 150% as Joss Whedon does it again creating a team of unique individuals.  If you like the X-Men, give Firefly a try!  The only disappointment is that after you watch them all, you are craving more.  I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who is a fan of Buffy and Angel, as well as anyone that has an appreciation for creative writing.
6305603847|5.0|PINK FLOYD THE WALL is a great music movies. I enjoyed the album so I thought I should see the movie. The first time I saw it I was blown away, just the visuals in the movie were just outstanding. The 2 major thing I wonder when I saw the movie is why didn't they release a soundtrack and why haven't they released the wall perfomances on DVD yet, they got the all star wall concert but not the pink floyd one. Bob Geldof did a great job performing PINK, I do wonder thought why they picked him. I did enjoy the animation in though. The best part is the music though.<br />DVD: Good DVD, I was dissapointed though about the commentary, I wish they had one with the band, director, and some of the cast. I also wished they did kind of a documentary on the album its self cause I think that would be intresting to see. The sound is good and the picture is good, this movie is better viewed in the widescreen format and being a widescreen fanatic I am this a better viewed in widescreen.
B0000028VT|5.0|This album is one of my favourite ones!!!!! When I listen to the songs I get calmer.. There are so many wise and actual things that when listennig to it you see your own life more or less..When I'm feeling down I use to get this cd gone on and on! It helps to get a desire to live the full life!!!!!!!<BR>I adore Mariah Carey!!!!!
6304383827|3.0|This is a masterpiece of English literature fashioned into a good Hollywood romantic comedy.  This is fine if one remembers that much of Jane Austen is lost in the translation, such as depth of characterization and lines added which were not in the original.  The filming is beautiful and the story is enjoyable but it's not Jane Austen.  Emma is not merely a bumbling matchmaker, and Harriet Smith is not a clutz as she is portrayed here.  Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse, is a more comical character in the book than in this movie. Mr. Knightley, as Emma's older mentor and ideal mate, needs more development.  For a better idea of Jane Austen's book catch the BBC production.
B00000JXVK|5.0|This is a good video by Bruce Brown Films. I Purchased this because I was allready getting into motorcycles and recently purchased a Honda Shadow. Music was a bit out-dated, but strangely enough, I now hum some of the musical themes from the movie.  (Very Carpenderish type 70's music).  I enjoyed the movie and found myself replaying it over 10 times and it is always nice to come back to it again. I especially liked the last bit at the end where all three bikers are riding around what appears to be a desert area near the coast of California.  The music meshed nicely with this part and that old Hammond B3 Organ.  The video is a good history account of racing in late 60's early 70's.  The theme of the movie appears to be that Motorcycles are both fun and dangerous, and shows the variety of racing approaches to the sport.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Hey it's the Beateles....I really liked this album anyway..nude or with the &quot;George Martin&quot; treatment. You either like the Beatles or you don't...if you don't...this woun't change anybody's mind. But i do really like hearing songs like Let It Be &amp; Long and Winding Road without strings. The remainder of the CD isn't really much different. This was never one of their most popular albums--but it's always been my favorite. It's full of what they did best..good old rock&amp;roll spiced with humor and poignancy the like of which has never been matched. Every group of kids with a hank of hair and a guitar tried (and still tries) to match them but didn't (don't) even come close.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth is one of my favorite bands. I own all of their cd's. This cd is without a doubt one of my favorite ones. <br />\\"Wreath\\" is such a great opening song it is unbelievable.Smadhing drums and guitars through the whole song. It also has bongos added into it, a little over half way through this 11 minute song.<BR>\\"Deliverance\\" is the best song on this cd, and one of my favorite songs of all time. It starts loud, but quickly gets slow into a great part.Then comes more bone-crushing music through the whole song. It gets slower as Akerfeldt whispers \\"Deliverance,thrown back at me.\\" Followed by my favorite end to any song that I have ever heard. A stunning 4-minute session of great guitars,bass, and drums.<BR>\\"A Fair Judgement\\" is another great song. Before I heard this song I thought that \\"To bid you farewell\\" off of the Morningrise cd was the best opeth slower song. This blows that song out of the water. Great vocals throughout the whole song. The guitar solos are also so awesome.<BR>\\"For absent Friends\\" is a cool little 2-minute instrumental that warms you up for the next 2 songs.<BR>\\"Masters Apprentice\\" is probably the loudest song on the cd.It is great and has some devilish vocals in it. It slows down a little bit. Then the growls shoot back at you, out of nowhere. It really caught me off guard the first time that I heard it.<BR>\\"By the pain I see in others\\" is my second favorite song on the cd, next to the title-track.It starts out with some great guitar work. Then the most evil vocals that I have ever heard comes. After all that the evil carnival music starts off, and the song only gets better from there.
B00005JMTN|3.0|-There is absolutely no evolution from the father we see in the numerous flashbacks (I forget his name) to the father reliving his youth through his fantastic fables.  In fact, I found it very hard to in any way relate the young, open minded, naive adventurer to the stubborn cancer patient he supposedly grows into.  This should be a vital part to this story and it's absence is devestating.<br />-In fact, I disliked the old version of the father quite a bit.  Actually, dislike is too tame a word, I despised him.  Even on a movie screen, where characters exxagerations are usually their charm, I found his personality irritating and obnoxious.  Here he is, dying, and his only son wants to have a heart to heart conversation with the father he never really knew.  And what does his father do?  He shoves out story after story, each one more unbelievable than the last, and gets angry when his son asks him to cut it out in favor of some honesty.  By the end I was kindof hoping he'd hurry up and kick the bucket.<br />-The ending I liked.  That is until the voice over came on with the proclomation that the father was in fact the stories he had always loved so much to tell, and that he relived them and thus became immortal.  How cheap.  How insulting.  Anyone reading this who's seen the film and was as moved as I was by the son's attempt to ease his father into death the right way will agree.  The symbolism of the shoes thrown up on the string, and the uncatchable fish ending up being the father's wife....the stupid voice over doesn't mesh with any of this and feels tacked on to please the viewers in the audience who are too lazy to think about the plot and come up with their own conclusion.  Very dissapointing.<br />These are a few of the blemishes that stopped me from enjoying an otherwise well made film.
0767020308|3.0|I enjoyed all the characters except the main character.  She came across as mean spirited, bigoted, immature and self-centered. There was nothing &quot;heroic&quot; about this heroine.  The ending was nice but not sufficiently developed.  <br />After seeing (and thoroughly enjoying Pride and Prejudice), my expectations were great.<br />I was disappointed -- not so much with the adaptation but with the character development.  There was little that was likable about this characer.  Maybe if this was a 2 dvd set as was Pride and Prejudice, the more positive characteristics of Emma would have been better developed and exhibited.<br />This was a pale &quot;copy&quot; of Pride and Prejudice or even Sense and Sensabilty.<br />Now, I'll be forced to view GP's version.
B000059XUO|5.0|Tragically, this film has been dismissed by many critics as an excessively violent movie designed to play to an audience of teenage Goths and vampire wannabees harboring a morbid fascination with death.  Equally tragic is the fact that the star of the film never got to see the completed picture, as he died in an on-set accident near the end of principal photography.   With his widow's consent, the filmmakers persevered and completed the film, intercutting doubles and digital reinsertions of Brandon Lee into the film.<br />Based on James O'Barr's graphic novel, the film was a groundbreaking entry into the realm of adult \\"comic book\\" fiction, using a non-traditional superhero (in many ways, an anti-hero) as its protagonist.   This dark film showed studio execs the power and profit waiting to be mined from graphic novel/comic book fiction.  Without the overwhelming success of The Crow, the dark heroes in Spawn, Blade, Road to Perdition, LXG, and the forthcoming Constantine and Hellboy might never have made it to the silver screen.<br />The film has always had the following aspects I found appealing:<br />1. The delicious characterization of the antagonists in the film.   Although some border on caricature, the villans are all uniquely evil, and all receive retribution commensurate for their crimes.  Particularly juicy are David Patrick Kelly's Milton-quoting \\"T-Bird\\" and Michael Wincott's \\"Top Dollar,\\" who has it all but wants even more.<br />2. The poetic justice of the villans (usually) having their own vices turned against them.    Particularly impressive is the death of T-Bird, whose tendencies toward arson are rewarded with his incendiary demise behind the wheel of his eponymous vehicle, and the Crow's subsequent \\"signature,\\" left in flaming accelerant at the scene of the crime.<br />3. The unique way in which a theme that has been done frequently (love is stronger than death) is handled throughout the film.<br />4. The stunning incorporation of music.   Alex Proyas has been unfairly criticized for turning the film into one long music video.  Certainly, the combination of Proyas' visual sense with the dark, nihilistic music of NIN, STP, The Cure, Rollins Band, Helmet, and Violent Femmes (just to name a few) displays his roots in directing music videos, but the film seamlessly oscillates between Graeme Revell's tender, melodic score and the film's heavy, alternative soundtrack at just the right moments.<br />Although the ill-advised sequels failed to live up to the visual (or box office) power of the original, The Crow offers a mournfully tragic, yet redeeming story if the viewer can look past the violence and strong language to the beauty of the story of eternal love and justice that lies beneath.
B00005JMCW|4.0|The premise of &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; has been done before - a magic spell causes two characters to switch bodies and thus perspectives - but this film is a ton of fun anyway.  Psychiatrist Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) are constantly at war.  Tess is days away from remarrying, and Anna feels the acute pain of having lost her father.  Anna has found refuge in her music, but her mother fails to see the importance of it, pulling the plug (literally) on Anna's big break.  When a well-meaning Chinese woman ensures that they will be forced to understand each other's lives, the comedy begins full-force.  The two wake up trapped in the body (and the daily life) of the other.  The script is smart and punchy, with twists that are not as formulaic as the premise might suggest.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are hilarious in their interpretations of the generation gap.  While I expected such a performance from Curtis, Lohan was a wonderful surprise.  Without the chemistry and talent between these two actresses, the film could have been lackluster.  The other actors, most notably bland Mark Harmon, cannot sustain the energy Curtis and Lohan create.  With animated aplomb, they even manage to overcome a few missteps in the screenplay.<br />This film provides some hearty laughs and, in the tradition of such films, sentimental tears at the end.  It's a great film for both adolescents and parents, with jabs at both - and neither will be embarrassed by watching it with the other.
6305508550|5.0|Despite its status as a modern \\"cult classic\\" and its frequent replays on cable TV, many people have still not seen Office Space, one of the funniest movies of the 1990s.  Written by Mike Judge (best known for his television work on Beavis &amp; Butthead and King of the Hill), Office Space is a spot-on spoof of what it is like to work in corporate America at the end of the twentieth century.   Ron Livingston plays a Peter Gibboons, a young professional at a software company who is utterly drained by his Dilbert-like existence.   During a hypnotherapy session, he expresses a phrase which crystallizes the work-life of hundreds of thousands of Americans: \\"ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's on the worst day of my life.\\"<br />In notable supporting roles are: Jennifer Aniston as Peter Gibbons' girlfriend who works as a waitress in a vaguely familiar restaurant where \\"flair\\" is more important than service; Stephen Root as Milton, the useless, overlooked, middle-aged employee who no one has the guts to fire; Gary Cole as passive-aggressive VP Bill Lumbergh, whom Livingston's Gibbons rightly declares \\"represents all that is soulless and wrong;\\" Diedrich Bader as Lawrence, Livingston's crude, simple next door neighbor that ultimately shows Gibbons the path to self-fulfillment; and John C. McGinley as one of the Bobs, consultants who have been called in to put a band-aid on the company's problems by doing a time and labor study.  <br />Some of the film's cruder moments with Lawrence &amp; office colleague Drew hearken back to Judge's B&amp;B days, but overall, this is an insightful &amp; wildly entertaining movie that manages to crystallize into 89 minutes the dehumanizing effect corporate America has had on American culture around the turn of the millennium.   Not only does the film speak satirical volumes about corporate America, but it also has great insight into the way human beings respond when they are marginalized and subjugated, particularly the liberation that retaliation brings.<br />As for the DVD itself, one can only hope that Fox will someday release this masterpiece in a better edition.  The opening menu pops up with an error message that your computer has a virus, a joke that is not funny under any circumstances.  The only special feature on the disc is the theatrical trailer.   Most blatantly absent is a commentary track from the mastermind, director, and uncredited actor in this comedic tour de force.  Fox execs need to give Mike Judge's masterpiece the treatment it deserves and give its many fans the goodies they desire.
B000005IS1|5.0|Most people know punk officially started with The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. Before those bands, there was a form of proto-punk called garage rock (And, no, I'm not talking about The Strokes or The Hives). These bands included The Monks, The Stooges, The New York Dolls, and MC5. MC5 remain to be the best of all these bands, with this politically-charged masterpeice. Music hadn't been this political since 1966's \\"Black Monk Time\\" by the Monks, and wouldn't be more political until The Clash's self-titled album. Well, enough with the history lesson, and a reveiw of the album.<br />1. \\"Rambilin' Rose\\" 10/10: The opening speech is amazing, and you can feel the excitement.<br />2. \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" 11/10: The classic of the album, legendary for the controversial opening line \\"Kick Out the Jams MOTHAF*CKA!\\". One of the best songs of the 60's, and certainly an anarchy anthem.<br />3. \\"Come Together\\" 10/10: Another classic on this album.<br />4. \\"Rocket Reducer No. 62 (Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa)\\" 9/10: Not my favorite on the album, but good anyways.<br />5. \\"Borderline\\" 8/10: It's good, but no classic.<br />6. \\"Motor City Is Burning\\" 6/10: My least-favorite song on the album. A little bit slower than the other songs.<br />7. \\"I Want You Right Now\\" 10/10: The album picks up after a slight slump. Of course this is nothing compared to the next track....<br />8. \\"Starship\\" 10/10: A memorable weirdout cover of Sun Ra (!). Words cannot describe this avant-garde classic.<br />Like so many other political bands of the past (Dead Kennedys, Millions of Dead Cops), the politics slightly date. However, just like it is with Dead Kennedys and MDC, the music certainly doesn't. Go and spend the $10, it's worth it.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Not nearly as entertaining as its predecessor, Full Throttle relies heavily upon admittedly dazzling CG special effects to compensate for the fact that the plot is thoroughly underdeveloped.  Demi Moore's return to the big screen is largely wasted, as her character seems more interested in showing skin than making any meaningful contribution to the plot.   And no, boys and girls, that's not why this is an \\"unrated\\" version.  Frankly, I'm even not sure what footage makes the Unrated version \\"unrated.\\"  Perhaps there were a few scenes that had to be cut or shortened to retain the PG-13 rating, but the \\"unrated\\" label amounts to a mere marketing ploy since &quot;unrated&quot; DVDs are all the rage these days.<br />Another grossly underutilized character in the film is Crispin Glover's \\"Thin Man,\\" who is the only character who is remotely interesting beyond the eye candy level.  Finally, Bernie Mac as Bosley lacks any of the qualities that Bill Murray brought to the first film, which was at least more tolerable than this piece of cinematic refuse.<br />I understand that this film was intended to be a \\"popcorn movie,\\" but even popcorn movies can only ask the viewer to suspend their disbelief so far.   Full Throttle clearly crosses this line in the first five minutes of the film, and then proceeds to new heights of absurdity.  Sure, a certain amount of \\"camp\\" was inherent in the adaptation from 1970s TV, but McG sends the viewer directly to Camp Ludicrous.<br />\\"McG\\" should go back to making McMusic videos for Smashmouth and Sugar Ray.  Unlike music videos, in a feature film one cannot substitute style for substance and call it anything but what it is: a B-movie marketed as a blockbuster.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This is not a review of the album,..only a review of the re-master.  If you don't already know the importance of this album then I feel sorry for you and the waste of ears God put on your head.<br />Look I know the record companies have been screwing us for years with this &quot;how many times can I purchase the same CD in a new box&quot; routine. First we bought it on vinyl, then tape, then CD and now the re-master- and all along we keep paying the same copyright charge over and over again. It is no wonder that people took a liking to the  old NAPSTER and the like, ...but I do have to say...This re-mastered copy of FRAGILE is phenomenal.  <br />There is finally silence in certain areas, and an overall crispness to the highs and lows.  This is an overwhelming addition to the drums and bass lines.  If you thought heart of the sunrise and the fish were incredible before wait till you get a load of this!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|After the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought perhaps that I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately, the film's first reel contains the best footage (which was mined thoroughly for the trailer), and the final hour and a half lead the viewer through a somewhat convoluted history of the blood feud between the vampire clan and the lycans.   The filmmakers clearly had a vision here, but they waited too long to introduce the exposition as to why the feud exists in the first place, and by the time they did, I had largely lost interest.  At one point, I looked at the counter on my DVD player and realized that, after 45 minutes, I still did not have a clear idea of what motivated these two supernatural clans to go after each other.  At that point, I began to question my own motivation for watching the film...<br />Unlike other movies in the vampire tradition where vampires are being hunted for the sake of human survival (e.g., Blade), we do not learn until much later in the film why it is that these two groups hate each other so much.  Sadly, by the time we find out, we don't really care.   <br />The only redemption for this movie is that Kate Beckinsale is stunning as the vampire death-dealer Selene.  Her presence is the only thing that keeps this from being completely unwatchable.  If only she wasn't burdened by such a pedestrian vehicle as this film...
0156027321|2.0|The plot of the Life of Pi has much potential for an exciting novel.  Unfortunately, it is a laborious read, except for portions where the author just writes the story without any tangents and unnecessary stream of consciousness episodes that serve no purpose.  There is too much telling of irrelevant details and thoughts and too little showing the reader entertaining action.  The action that does occur in the book is intriguing--the ship sinking, Pi and some animals in the lifeboat, their subsequent interactions, and his quest for survival.  There is a plethora of opportunity here to write more creatively, but the writer attempts to stimulate us with droll talk of religion and mundane information.<br />The book ends with attempts at profundities but just left me wondering what it was all about.  I think I have a decent sense for spiritually significant writing, but I did not catch any meaningful insights from this book.  Maybe I missed it.<br />I think there are some real inconsistencies with the main character Pi.  I know this is a story of a child being told by the child as an adult, but Pi is like a small child in one scene and next thing you know he is lecturing about religious ideas.  He is familiar with the nature of animals from growing up in a zoo, but then he weeps over a fish he has to kill to eat.  <br />The interaction with the tiger and the other animals was entertaining and imaginative and may make the book worth reading--there just isn't enough of it and it tends to become filled with minutia rather than action.<br />The high expectations generated by the introductory chapters never came full circle.<br />You might enjoy this book, but it is one I was disappointed with throughout as my expectations were let down.
B000050FEN|5.0|There are only a handful of films that are good enough for me to benchmark the experience of seeing them in the theater.  Se7en is one of those movies.  I saw the film for the first time with a group of friends on a college trip.  We went into the film laughing and joking, and when we emerged, we were all totally silent for at least fifteen minutes.   We were still recovering from the shock of this film, the benchmark by which I have since judged all suspense thrillers. <br />The film is exceptionally well-written, merging classical elements of the ars praedicandi (the ancient teaching texts to which Freeman's character refers in the film), with Dante's Inferno, and Milton's Paradise Lost with a serial murder investigation in a modern metro area.   While the exact location is nondescript, the location is simultaneously nowhere and everywhere, thus making this \\"everycity\\" that much more disturbing.<br />Freeman is brilliantly cast as the aging, jaded Detective Somerset, ready to retire, while Brad Pitt makes the perfect brash foil to Freeman's Somerset.  A character study in contrast, Pitt's impulsive irreverence keeps the viewer engaged and entertained, while Freeman's brooding Somerset provides necessary exposition and grounds the story with his shrewd, patient omniscience.<BR> <BR>Kevin Spacey's John Doe is one of the most frightening villans to have ever graced the screen, not merely because of the horrible murders the character commits, but because of the character's cool amorality regarding his own actions.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Leland Orser also make appearances in gut-wrenching supporting roles.<br />Not intended for those who are pregnant or nursing or for those who have heart or kidney conditions, this film will grab your viscera and twist them until you want to beg for mercy, then make you want to come back for more.  This is more than just another genre film.   It redefines the suspense/thriller genre, and its brutal ending becomes only marginally less upsetting on subsequent viewings.  <br />The Platinum Edition DVD is a must in this case.  With digitally enhanced negative transfer, digitally remastered surround sound, and loads of special features, the film finally looks and sounds like the masterpiece it is.   If you only saw this movie in the theater, you have not seen this film the way Fincher intended it to be seen. <br />Fincher's commentary track is, like the commentary on Fight Club, thoroughly entertaining and enlightening, and he has gone into the vault to provide us with an alternate opening sequence, as well as a coda-less ending, and a vastly different storyboarded ending that was never filmed.  Only special feature that could have easily been omitted is Morgan Freeman's whiny, self-absorbed commentary track.  I respect Freeman immensely as an actor, but he's rather annoying when allowed to ramble on unscripted.  <br />Another one of the best films of the 1990s, the Platinum Series version of Se7en is a must for any DVD collection!
0790731452|4.0|This is a great release from Tim Burton. The film is wall to wall with cameos and parodys of characters. Particular stand outs are Sarah Jessica Parker, Glenn Close and of course Jack Nicholson. <BR>Compared to his other works, this film doesn't quite reach the emotional depths of Scissorhands or the intellectual wit of 'Nightmare' but still a great film!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Viewed under the right conditions by the right person, this movie is an absolute treat.  Viewed by the wrong person or by someone not in the right frame of mind, the movie's darkly comedic undertones can easily be missed amidst the brutal violence and coarse language.  That said, I viewed this movie under optimal conditions and with an open mind.  As a result, I stumbled upon one of my favorite films of all-time.<br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton really strut their comedic stuff in this movie, as both are brilliant in their roles.  Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf also manage to steal scenes throughout this perfectly cast film.  The entire cast walks the comedic line brilliantly without ever becoming campy, a feat for which David Fincher can take a significant amount of the credit.<br />In Fight Club, Fincher truly shows his directorial genius in distilling Chuck Palahniuk's great but somewhat disjointed novel into a compelling, hilarious, and coherent storyline.  Although Fincher's version neglects some of Palahniuk's fundamental vision (the ultimate futility of nihilism, in particular), he captures the overall spirit of the noval and makes the story linear enough that movie audiences can follow the character from IKEA-loving corporate drone to anarchistic mastermind.  With the blackest of humor, Fincher decries everything that is wrong with modern society, from corporate America's cornflower-blue ties and action items to the emasculation and isolation of the American male to the evils of consumerism.  All important messages for people in the oft targeted 18-49 demographic.<br />I have viewed the film with a number of other people, and my observation has been that people under 40 tend to view the film as brilliant and visionary, while people over 40 tend to take it too literally.  That is why I titled this review: the first rule of fight club is, don't take Fight Club too seriously.  Revel in the main character's insomnia and schizophrenia, and try to get Palahniuk&amp; Fincher's serious messages at the same time, understanding that those messages are conveyed through extreme hyperbole.<br />Finally, if you have the opportunity, be sure to listen to the Fincher commentary on the film, as it is probably one of the most insightful commentary tracks on any DVD currently on the market.  Fincher gives tremendous insight into the details of making this film that are interesting and pertinent enough to captivate anyone, from the most serious film student to the most casual viewer of films.  Watch this and enjoy!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Not one to buy &quot;popular&quot; music very much, imagine my surprise when after purchasing this CD based on a review I read that it has become one of my favorite pieces of music.<br />This young lady has more talent in her right hand than I have heard in a very long time.  Her voice is amazing and her talent on the keyboards is astounding.<br />Beyonce can get the accolades and the others can take turns seeing who can show the most skin in their videos but talent, true talent, trumps all.  Alicia Keys is true unadulterated and amazingly wonderful talent.<br />Buy this CD. You will be rewarded with an amazing piece of work.
B00005JLT5|4.0|Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this film.  I heard the reviews and Oscar nominations, but I had no idea what I was going to experience when I popped this into my DVD player.<br />What makes the film so oddly compelling is Adrien Brody's silent performance.  There are long sections of the film that smoulder on the screen with an eerily noisy silence.  Combined with the constant uncertainty of what will happen next, the film places the viewer unnervinngly on edge...for two and a half hours!  While it was undoubtedly the director's intent to convey the sense of imminent danger to the audience, much of the film involves Adrien Brody crawlingly silently through the rubble of ruined buildings. I can't help but to wonder if the film could have been shortened considerably with some careful editing of some of these long pauses, which ultimately do not provide much in the way of exposition or character development.<br />Also interesting to me as a music lover was the subtext of music transcending race and nationality, even between a Nazi and a Jew.  A commendable piece of filmmaking, although ultimately not quite as powerful as Schindler's List.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I use to really hate Christina, i never liked her image and thought her music was horrible, but this CD has totally changed my mind. Christina has a beautiful voice that you really get to hear in this cd, especially in the song A Voice Within...she has really put alot of work in expressing herself in this new album, it has many upbeat and slow songs that make this album equally great! I was never a Christina Fan, but now i'm the biggest!! She may have the best voice of this time...

When he gets there he realizes it's basically a wild goose chase, trying to find Rachel Lane who is a missionary there.<br />I think that this book is very good.  This book snatches you from the beginning. When Troy Phelan does something so bizarre that you will never believe it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I think this album may be her best...I feel she has gotten out of singing the bubblegum pop song and doing different kind of stuff, she adds rap in Boom Boom with the Ying Yang twins and a little techno even...i love this cd, Toxic is definitly the best song on this album, it has a cool beat with a sexy attiude, it has to be my favorite cd of hers...definitly a good buy, even if you're not a big britney fan!
B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac appeared as the all time best rapper.... and I can see why. Each of his albums sold great, he was the most realest gangster ever... he was just an awesome guy. He and his enemy, The Notorious B.I.G., were just the most awesome people in the thug history. They both started out in the early days,and didn't live the long lifes they should of. They were awesome. This album, All Eyez On Me, probably sold as the best selling rap album. Many songs &quot;2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;How Do You Want It&quot; &quot;all about u&quot; made there way to blazing hits, and theye were unforgettable songs, and still are, eventhough 2pac is dead now. And it includes [the remix] of 2Pac's biggest hit &quot;California Love&quot; which the normail version was only released on 2Pac's greatest hits, which [might] of sold better than this one. But to the point, after the two kings of rap left this world, rap was just not the same. Rap IS still awesome, but just not the same. Those two really kept the game real, and I will always remember them. I hope everyone does. Even if there are some new kings of the rap game, forget them! keep 2pac and biggie in your heart! theye are the REAL kings. &quot;hit Em' Up&quot; [which is not on this album] really made me sad/mad. Why couldn't the two best rappers in the game get along. Which in the beggining of the game theye were. Did concerts together, but since Biggie copied 2Pac's stuff, theye were never the friends that theye were before.Puff daddy, and the whole BadBoy Records crew, were all enemys of 2Pac.It was a big rap battle. Later, in 1996, after 2Pac's death, Biggie Smalls was getting interviewedalot. More later, owner of death row records, Suge Knight, hired someone to kill Biggie. After that, the whole rap game was never like it was before. There is no one, as gifted as 2pac. His mother should be proud of what such talent her son was gifted with. He is just an awesome person. No one can match him. So, people, listen to what Isaid, take it to heart,  that no matter what, 2pac will be in are hearts.
B00005R2M3|3.0|This woman just fell off the face of the earth didn't she? She must be shaking in her boots seeing how Enrique's latest cd bombed,(and rightly so), and Ricky Martin had already seen his day in the American market when this album came out. &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; makes my ass shake!! I LOVE that song! &quot;Fool&quot; is really nice, as is &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; no matter how absurd that title is. I wish that there were no Spanish language songs on this album...I don't think it's fair that I have to pay money to hear someone speak a language that I can't understand. Sorry that's how I feel. No matter how un-PC it is. I'm not talking about the Spanish version of &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; I'm talking about the other 2 spanish songs that are on the cd. So next time out for Shakira here is my advice , IMHO of course...<BR>1. Drop the Spanish songs on American albums!<BR>2. Lose the silly song titles &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;..what??? <BR>3. Keep it up beat..really it sounds like you have a hard time   singing ballads!!!<BR>4. More songs like &quot;Whenever...&quot; and &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...THIS IS THE BEST SCI-FI SHOW SINCE TNG AND DS9 - And the sad thing is, it's actually better than anything done with the Star-Trek universe, of which I'm a hardcore fan. And I wouldv'e slapped someone had they said THAT to me. But IT'S TRUE!!!!<br />DO NOT MISS FIREFLY IF YOU LOVE SCI-FI!!!!! <br />You'll thank me.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Thank God for Pink. She actually broke away from what her record label was telling her to do and she came out with this exhilarating album! From start to finish this cd this cd rocks and rocks and rocks!!! I was not a fan of &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; when it came out, and to tell you the truth still not. But songs like &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot;, &quot;18 Wheeler&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; are just wonderful artistic expressions! This girl just does not care and it is refreshing!!! The message of &quot;18 Wheeler&quot; is so freeing!!! She tells us no matter how hard we get beat down, we can still get back up and better then ever!!! Coming out after 9/11 that was a message that we could not get enough of. &quot;Numb&quot; is another great song!! &quot;Misery&quot; w/Steven Tyler could have been a huge hit! Nice and bluesy as is &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;! &quot;Family Portrait&quot; delves into Pink's troubled childhood, and we know that we are the better for having Pink &quot;suffered&quot;! We get all this wonderful music! I'm sorry to see that her latest album &quot;Try This&quot; got lost in the &quot;Spankin New Music&quot; hoopla that is the month of November. It deserves to be as big as this album was. Check this album out!!!
0312995423|3.0|My least favorite of his books.
B000084T18|2.0|I really am not a fan of the rap music. I mean, here is somebody that has been shot at 9 times (supposedly), has openly copped to dealing drugs and being involved in gang violence. But he is making millions of dollars, while people like me who are honest and hardworking are scrapping to get by. So, since I really hate rap music (2 stars for the music...) I will review the brotha's chest. OMG...he is built like a brick ....house!!! He is hot!!!
B0000640VN|5.0|I loved this movie because Hugh Jackman's elegant kind hearted english voice gave it a twist for all the people who only have seen his X-Men films. This movie show how good he really is  on stage. Meg Ryan was also very awesome in this movie. The Chemistry between them both keeps your eyes gluded to the tv. This movie has a lot of comedy as well. You could classify this one comedy Romance. I recommend you rent this DVD or if you see it for under ten buck buy it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM!!!
B000089RVR|1.0|I don't usually get worked up about music and pretty much have a live and let live attitude. I can live with teenie stuff like Busted and Britney as it's clear that they're aimed squarely at kids. But Dido? This is classic coffee table music for the bland and the passionless. If it was a colour it would be beige. It's music for accountants.<br />Some reviewers have called it a great/fine 'sophomore' effort. Soporific more like.  Dido is the one female artist who makes the Corrs sound like L7 her music is that insipid.
B00005JKN9|4.0|This movie was very interesting &amp; had a outstanding cast. I was a little irritated that they threw a nude scene in the movie though. That's the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Leonardo was awesome in this movie. Liam Nieson also was in th movie for a short period in the begining. This was a great New York Movie!  I RECOMMEND YOU SEE!!!
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Demi Moore is a housewife who goes to Vegas with her husband and loses all their money at the casino. A rich tycoon (Redford) offers a proposal. One night in bed with the man's wife (Demi) for a big wad of money. She accepts...however, after the smoke clears, the husband suspects that his wife is still seeing the tycoon &amp; ends up divorcing her. She runs to the tycoon to start a new relationship. Will money buy her the happiness she seeks? Find out for yourself!
B00003CY6M|5.0|Ok, this movie is ovbiously a very good movie for John Cusack fan's or even a romance or date movie to rent. I really enjoyed the chemistry between both of these fine actors. the winter time of the year really made the backroud astounding &amp; beautiful. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
B00005JMGL|5.0|J.M. Barrie would be proud of this film. The characters were portrayed perfectly. Great cast, Great script, Great movie!
0688156819|4.0|I read this all in one sitting and thought it was a wonderful, twisted blast of sardonic fun.  I've always appreciated Burton's odd and dark sense of humor, so I felt perfectly at home within the pages of this little book.  It's a bit pricey for the length, but I got over it. <br />However, unless your kids are as weird as I was as a kid, I probably wouldn't make it bed-time fare for the young'uns.  If you're a fan of calming hysterical children freaked out by dreams about the boy with nails in his eyes, then by all means...
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|So I think the only reason i gave this cd more than the minimum 1 star is because i really loved Mer de Noms and I really like Weak and Powerless . . however since that first cd and said song are not at all representative of the 13th step 2 stars was the furthest I could go. <br />What is it that I don't like about this cd? Perhaps its the fact that I can barely hear Maynard's willowly, whisper throughout most of the songs. Maybe its because nearly every song sounds alike. Maybe its because even the songs that don't sound nearly identical to the one before it is still something without melody, passion or power. No wonder there's strife in the Perfect Circle camp. For some strange reason Maynard wants things to be soft and light and incoherant while certain other band members actually prefering some structure and melody (and covers without slugs on em) . I hope that this phase passes but realistically, it probably ain't gonna so i guess now i'm just hoping they break up and leave us in peace.
0345457684|5.0|On the advice of my father, who I feel has impeccable taste in SciFi, I picked this book up sometime last year and probably ended up reading it through within a day or two of its receipt.  It's an incredibly fun and perilously vivid read.  The other reviews do a good job of pecking on the details, but I just wanted to add my two cents.  <br />Great time.  Can't wait for more Kovacs.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel, an 18 year old girl from the old kingdom, recieves news that her father, the abhorsen, is in danger. So on a periless mission she sets out to find him. It's a story of danger, defiance, death, destiny and love, as Sabriel meets up with a free magic being called Mogget, and a long lost Prince called Touchstone.<br />This is a fantastic book and the characters and places are brought to life superbly. Sabriel has to grow up fast and finds herself falling in love with the servile Touchstone, who is trying to regain his memory.<br />But the best character is Mogget. He's sarcastic, sardonic and sly, you just know he's up to something
B000089RVX|5.0|I must admit &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; causes me to sit up and pay attention to this band... I'm scared of heavy rock.... But when I reached &quot;My Immortal&quot;, I knew I have to get this CD for whatever the excuses I may come up with. One thing I like about this album is the MOOD.... the theme is so consistent... - dark and operatic! Superb album and the Grammy nominations are so well deserved!
0425170349|5.0|If you want to talk about a page turner, this is it.  I would lock my self in my room so I could get through a whole scene.  Clancy goes into so much detail about what is going on at that moment.  Not so much as to bore you.  This is a great book to start out with if you are just starting to read Tom Clancy's books.
B000094DUP|4.0|Well how can you not be skeptical? Her name just sounds tacky, she plays the piano and writes her \\"own\\" songs like 100 other young singers, and also she comes from the soap \\"Neighbours\\" notoriously know for cashing-in on pop music with their young actors. Reminder: 2002's Holly Valance. <br />Well... that was before I discovered what a real musician she actually is, definitely a musician before an actress. Her astonishing debut album \\"Innocent Eyes\\" is a breath of fresh air; pop music that isn't fabricated, a voice that's pure, strong and with range which reminiscence Celine's, and songwriting credits more creditable that Jennifer Lopez or Britney Spears. <br />The album is heavily full of ballads backed with a piano melody, with some faster mid-tempo piano/guitar backed tracks -think Celine. And that's what I love about her, she sticks to what she's good at/capable of. She won't do something wild just to raise her popularity, like for example, her voice is diva-toned/strong, but she won't sing ballads that stress her voice just to prove what a songstress she is. The album is produced by UK Pop music fanatics Gary Barlow, Eliot Kennedy, Vince Pizzinga, Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate, Kara DioGuardi and one cut by Delta Goodrem. <br />The album's intro is \\"Born To Try\\", her first single produced by pop music expert Ric Wake. It reached #1 with its uplifting chords and lyrics: <br />\\"All that you see is me/And all I truly believe/I was born to try\\" <br />Her second single, \\"Lost Without You\\" is a heartbroken ballad that is all about me, me and me! Bizarrely enough the track doesn't end up being too mushy. The other heartbroken ballad is \\"Not Me, Not I\\", the track which was inspired by her own affecting experience. <br />The title track has been described as autobiographic, sounding like Tori Amos. The song also displays the uniquness, strength and range of her vocals, especially in the chorus. \\"Predictable\\" the fifth release from the album is a faster song with a killer piano intro, here Delta tells that boy to stop 'cos he's too predictably going to break her heart. <br />All the tracks mentioned above, have all peaked at #1 on the Australian Singles Chart. Blatantly because her music is graceful pop music, and that she's a grateful, kind and generous person who treats her fans will respect -take note Britney! <br />Besides the singles, there are simple but soaring ballads: \\"Butterfly\\" and self-written reflective \\"In My Own Time\\". The up-tempo songs don't meet the caliber of Delta's ballads, but \\"This Is Not Me\\", \\"Longer\\" and \\"Throw It Away\\" are unique in their own righteous way. But one song which shouldn't be overlooked is the album's conclusion, Delta self-written and self produced \\"Will You Fall For Me\\". <br />There's nothing innovative or ground breaking here, except the success it's achieved: five consecutive Number 1 singles. With her third single, Delta climbed into the record books as the only Australian female artist to have three consecutive #1s. She has also won 7 A.R.I.A. Awards (think Australian Grammy's). (Sony has produced one CD with a Gold layer representing its millionth sale in Australia.) But what this album does include is solid pop songs with some variety, depth and soul -a bit like Idol's Will Young and Spice Girls' Melanie C. This album has established her as an artist - more like Australia's most successful female artist, and will lead her onto bigger things. <br />She was diagnosed with cancerous Hodgkin's disease in August '03, but her treatment has been completed and results are in waiting. And you don't need to know or have met her to see the injustice in that. But the experience has been a growth period for her, compelling emotional and darker songs. <br />You know what's so appealing about Delta Goodrem to me? It is her Scorpio character. A definite good role model for pre-pubescent girls (and boys). Also check out her \\"Predictable\\" single, which includes A-Side John Lennon festive classic: \\"Merry X-Mas (War Is Over)\\" -very emotional considering the artist's circumstance. It also includes the B-Side \\"Here I Am\\" remix, which was on her official debut \\"I Don't Care\\", a mediocre pop song -Sony's attempt to turn Delta into a Britney-esque artist. <br />Oh yeah: There's also the \\"Delta\\" DVD, for fans who really wanna get to know who she is.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This film was far better than the other Sci-Fi/Fantasy &quot;blockbuster&quot; that came out this past year.(The Leaque of Extraordinary Gentlemen) While it did play with some of the classic rules of Vamps and Lycans everyone needs to take a breath and realize that this is all fiction! Vamps aren't real and neither are Lycans and even if they were this is just a movie! Why do so many people nitpick stuff just because they didn't follow the classic rules? Who cares it isn't a remake of Dracula or any of the shlockey 1950's werewolf films it is its own creation and so they used what they wanted to use and made up new ideas that were creative and exciting. <BR>If this were a remake of a classic book or movie then I could understand all the criticisim but get real folks, or perhaps I should say get unreal! LOL You are all taking a piece of fiction way too seriously and need to relax and enjoy the new ideas that these excellent filmamakers devloped for this film. <BR>If everything always followed the rules set down by earlier writers/myths then nothing new would ever be written or filmed!!!<BR>Now as for the film the acting was quite good and I really enjoyed Kate Bekinsale taking on a new role so different from all the Jane Austen and Shakespeare she had been doing.
B0000640SA|5.0|First things first:<br />The movie:<br />Memento is an ingenious film center on the life of Leonard Shelby, a brain-damaged widower who obstensibly lost his ability to form new long-term memories when his wife was raped and presumably murdered. The caveats in that previous sentence are result of the film's storytelling which do not allow a viewer to take ANYTHING presented onscreen for granted. The movie immediately sets you in Leonard's world as it is presented in a succession of 5-10 minute flashbacks, which chop your own knowledge of events into segments like Leonard lives. It is this unusual presentation that drives the movie. What would otherwise be a relatively dull plot is brilliantly revealed in turns and twists in this presentation. The distortion of time becomes the primary narrative device, rather than a cheap gimmick, and truly makes Memento a better movie. The acting in the film is good though not brilliant, with the best work coming from those around an above-average Guy Pierce.<br />Generally viewers either love or despise this film's ultimate plot, but no one disputes it's creativity. This film's heart is black at best, and takes a decidedly bleak and utilitarian outlook. While it will not change anyone's life, it does deal a massive narrative twist, the biggest in a long series of reverses and shifted angles. <br />Ultimately, though, if you see the movie once, you will want and need to see it again, and likely again. It is simply impossible to take everything in on the first viewing, because you simply don't learn enough to catch the import of every detail. Which is why one would want the DVD.<br />Which brings us to this very unusual disc. The packaging itself, which mimic a patient's file at a mental hospital, sheds light on the enigmatic Leonard Shelby and his past.  The package also provide some hidden instructions for viewing the first disc. The menus on the disc are presented as a series of slides from a mental competence exam, but an extremely strange one whose questions are not always answerable. The first disc has a few hints that point at the various sub-menus. This brings us to the second disc.<br />The second disc is similar to the first, with the same moving slides of the exam, but is completely without instructions or even hints of any kind. The viewer is forced to paw around confusedly looking to see what special features they might stumble upon. This is an artistic decision that borders on cruel, but fits with the overall ethos of the film. Hidden among the many unanswerable questions is a version of the film with all the scenes in chronological order, which does much to deepen your understanding of the film, should you find it (or, like me, look up how to get there on the Internet)<br />While the second disc fits the overall artist approach of the film, it is frankly an unacceptible case of viewer torture. The features are worth finding, but not worth the huge investment it would take to do so. But I am sure Chris Nolan loves that I react so strongly to it. Because it is a tremendous movie, and the special features are unique and very good, I give the disc the 5-star rating, but ONLY because the needless complexity of the second disc can be beaten by an Internet connection.
6304765231|5.0|This is a wonderful film. Make sure you check out the comic book that inspired it. It's fantastic too.
0393057658|4.0|Michael Lewis attempts to address what should be the wildly anomalous winning of the bargain-basement Oakland A's. While it is an open secret that Billy Beane relies on new-wave objective analysis, his past, his motivations, and the extent to which he uses it was not widely known. Lewis takes an adoring look at the A's organization, Billy Beane, the growth of sabermetrics, and baseball as he recounts a meandering tale that brought us the current edition of the A's. <br />Michael Lewis in unabashed in his admiration for Beane, and spares little time to give Beane's critics voice. (Even then, he does so in the weakest form, by quoting the less-than-geniuslike Joe Morgan, and even then giving Billy Beane the last word) Many reviewers have chosen to take Beane to task for the A's lack of postseason success, which is not relevant to this book. Instead Lewis tells a story charmingly and brimming with lightweight, character-revealing anecdotes. Lewis's prose is very down-to-earth, and he conveys ideas with tremendous clarity, and especially excels at introducing new concepts, contrasting them well with the previous line of thought.<br />Moneyball is a fun read that gives a terrific look inside the front offices of baseball that is very accessible to the casual reader. While the author's perspective does color the tale, this does not alter the fact that the book is very enjoyable and even worth a reread.
B0000024UF|2.0|I don't know what to say; I really don't.  Ordinarily, I delight in having contrarian opinions (but only when I feel they're warranted, thankyouverymuch), but here...what can I say?  I'm a big Cohen fan; I have all his stuff, and his first album may well be my favorite CD ever.  But...geez.  No matter HOW many times I listen to this, I simply CANNOT get into it.  It's my least favorite of his albums, by far.  That is not, of course, to say there's nothing I like here; indeed 'Story of Isaac' is very possibly my favorite Cohen song--it's simply an incredible piece of music.  &quot;Thought I saw an eagle/but it might have heen a vulture&quot; just sends chills down my spine every time.  Along with a number of other parts.  Furthermore, okay--'...Nancy,' 'The Partisan,' and 'Tonight will be Fine' aren't bad (I almost feel obligated to include 'Bird on a Wire' in that list, but I'm just not feeling it--it would almost certainly be my least favorite track on any given Cohen 'best of').  The REST though--my god, it gives new meaning to the word 'bland.'  And even the lyrics--which, at least, are usually a high point even in a bad Cohen song--seem pretty monochromatic.  Or maybe not--when I see them written out, I think, okay, that's not bad, but in the context of the songs...there just ain't no life in them.  A shame. <br />Out of ten songs, one classic, three 'okays,' and six that might as well have been left off.  Thus, two out of five.  Though I want to emphasize again that I'm not happy to have this opinion.  It's just that...well, what can I say?  Would it make up for it if I noted that I think Death of a Ladies' Man is a great, underrated album?  Probably not, eh?  Well, it's true.  I'd buy that one before this, although 'Story of Isaac' alone makes it ultimately worth the purchase for the committed.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|One of the marks of a great musician is the influence he or she has over current and future generations of listeners and musicians, in particular the latter.  With Highway 61 Revisited, Bob Dylan knocked the socks off of the listening public as well as the elite musicians of the era.  When one considers the revolutionary evolution of popular music in the 60's Bob was one of the leading poets and these songs were among his best ever.  Many musicians back then learned to play these tunes, but few had the guts to play them before a live audience.  Spin forward to the summer of '67 at Monterey, where Jimi Hendrix played an incredible varsion of Like a Rolling Stone.  Now THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is an example of influence in action.  And it was and is truly essential.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|listening to billy boyd's song always brings tears to my eyes.<BR>howard shore and sir james galway are geniuses.
B0000C8AV3|5.0|OK, I'm in huge disagreement with Mr. T's review - to each his own.  To me, this is one of the great Dylan albums, solid front to back, great singing, great playing.  There is variety in the attitude of the tunes, from the rollicking Neighborhood Bully to the subtle lovesick call of Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight.  And it doesn't appear that Bob was just sitting back and cruising here - he's stretching out, being challenged.  When I think of Dylan's great protest songs of the 60's, I believe License to Kill holds its own quite well.  And if Bob were any more cynical than he was on Man of Peace, he probably would have ended up in Frank Zappa's band!<br />This is a coherent album, with masterful flow within each song and in the fit of each song within the whole.  I've lived in the streets these songs describe, and I'm willing to bet you have too.  These tunes paint everyday pictures - images we take for granted and maybe don't take the time to fully understand.  No problem, because Bob's done a fine job of fleshing the dense stuff out for us.  Just belley up and have a taste.
0062502182|2.0|A very good friend recommended this book to me as a life-changer.  Yeh I could see the value of it, maybe moreso when I read it again.  However the night before I finished it I read a story to my kids about a guy named John Chapman, the peddlar of Swaffham, an English legend of sorts from the 15th century.  The next night, I finished the alchemist and was pretty disgusted to find that the conclusion was nothing but an exact rip off of the legend.  This book's supposed to be a stand-out, and as such you expect quality and moreso, *originality* throughout.  Overall its probably a reasonably good read, but in the end I feel completely cheated by such a blatant piece of plagarism.
B000083E79|5.0|Who cares what a stupid person from nowhere (oops i mean New Zealand) has to say about Cher, She is the BEST! You are a nobody, so..... a recomendation... get yourself a brain. CHER ROCKS!!! You and your questions SUCK! ^_^ The very best of Cher is a great album and a must have for everyone.
B000002TQV|5.0|I'm not going to pick a favorate Radiohead album....you can't make me.  It would be unfair.  Each is like a differnet story; a completely different sound.  This is a disc that hasn't strayed far from my cd player since it's intitial purchase however many years ago.  It does, like many great albums, require a few listens through.  Track picks are (if I must) Planet Talex, High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, and Bulletproof. Anyway, you can't really go wrong with any Radiohead record...especially this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never heard of this series until recently. After watching &quot;Firefly - The Complete Series,&quot; I can only say that this is a excellent series! The episodes are very well written and the story line is solid. The interaction by the cast is extraordinary and makes each episode enjoyable to watch. <br />Warning! Some of the episodes in this DVD set have scenes and situations which are not suitable for children and maybe a little extreme for others. Be aware of this before purchasing.
B00004Z459|5.0|being linkin parks biggest fan i can tell you that this is one of their best CDs ever....and if u think other wise than u probley like justin timberlake...these are my favorite songs<BR>~~CRAWLING - this is one of my fav songs because i can some what relate to it ..and it has a very catchy beat.<BR>~~ONE STEP CLOSER- this is another one of my fav song because it is really tru to life song...another catchy beat.<BR>~~IN THE END- the is another one of my favorite songs because this was the song that made me like linkin park...and this is yet another catchy beat.<BR>so in other words: buy this cd cuz u won't regreat it because this is the all time best cd...its worth your 13.99
B000022TSV|4.0|The visuals of the film is very good and atmospheric, except for the bullfighting scenes which are too gory. As for the singings, Placido Domingo does an excellent job, but not so Julia Migenes. Sometimes I can't tell whether it is just her singing style or she is out of breath. She may not ruin the film but she is not very pleasant to hear. Having a sexing acting Carmen may appeal to a lot of people, but this is not the reason I listen to opera.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I know this cd has been out for quite some time now, but really--how did I miss it?!  This cd is incredible--honestly, my friends haven't heard me shut up about it for a week.  Jack is on a completely different wavelength than so many of the artists out there right now.  This is an album that will still be a great album in 30 years.<br />I love the fact that this is such a great ALBUM, not just a bunch of individually great tracks. I put it in &amp; actually listen to it all the way through, instead of jumping between tracks that I like.  This has made me see how the art of a great album is such a dying trend...mostly due to the current popularity of single tracks of music, made popular by the piracy of music on the internet.<br />If you decide to take Jack Johnson home with you today, you definitely won't be disappointed.
B000089RVX|1.0|Apparently this is metal, apparently this is original, apparently this about a metal band with singing, apparently this is metal.<br />forgive my ignorance but I truly do not understand how the lay public consider this metal.  let us take a look at the reasons why: -<br />1) Solos.  if I play Iron Maiden, Pantera, hell even Chimaira in my cd player.  I am rewarded with a nice solo with layered harmonies, a great starting riff and a good ending melody.  On this there are either no solo's at all or even worse solo's so slapdash that a blind five year old could do better.  Let us take 'Going Under' as an example. This song is meant to be hardcore as it is a defiant diatribe against being pampered by media and has this horrnedous four second long solo where the guitarist merely randomly slashes the strings.  it is so bad it makes a solo by Kerry King  (For the lay public who have no idea who this is he is in the thrash band 'Slayer') sound like something by Joe Satriani (God of guitar playing)<br />2) Lyrics; - I don't know what it is about nu-metal that means that they have to do this \\"We hate\\" or \\"We're not broken\\" and so on.  There is more to life than complaining about such superficial things as self popularity.<br />3) Soul: - i have read tons of reviews on this site and they are full of things like 'Such raw passion', 'Snarling aggression of an angel's voice' and stuff like that.  To me it sounds boring, Amy Lee for a start doesn't suit the music, she is awful live (I suffered a two-second snippet of their donington performance before seeing metallica on the hidden stage!) and contrary to belief is not a good singer.  Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford and Angela Gossow (most people won't have a clue who they are) are far better.<br />This album to me is the perfect example of a band wanting the sales and success of a pop album, while pampering to an audience of 12 year olds.  This is an album that is exactly the reason why since 2000 the music scene has been awful.  Inthat time we have seen Limp Bizkit, Good Charlotte, HIM, Linkin park, Sum 41 and Papa Roach become huge.  All of them have no versatility, no originality, no soul and no point.<br />Do yourselves a favour and research exactly what it means to play guitar, to sing dark gothic music and to write lyrics.  Go and listen to some proper music, but pleas stay away from this.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Big Fish is one of those movies everyone should see. We can all relate to it somehow and Time Burton has given himself another hit movie.<br />Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom's life. Young Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and old Bloom by Albert Finney. He is on his deathbed and his son Edward who is played by Billy Crudup has come to make his reconciliation with his dad. He's tired of his dad's stories and wants the truth from him. He feels like he doesn't know his dad, and he knows time is runnig out.<br />Ewan McGreggor is awesome. His fans will argue this as his best performance ever and I think it is. He is enchanting in the movie. He does a great job faking the accent and he just takes the role and runs with it. I wish he could get really get academy consideration for his role. It's really that great and an Oscar nomination should go his way. He's just as good as Depp in Pirates and Penn in Mystic River. This could be the best performance of his young carear. Ewan won't disappoint you.<br />I liked Billy Crudup in the movie. His character isn't a real lively one and has a lot of mixed emotions about his father. Crudup plays with the emotions well. He's a good actor and I hope to see more of his work in the future.<br />You also have to love Albert Finney in the movie. His character is loveable and he displays a spark that just makes you smile. He's a loveable old guy and his performacne will and can draw tears.<br />Tim Burton has just made a simply fantastic film. I really wish I could just shake his hand. He's a great director and has always made original and fun films. They've always been a little werid, but it's always made them special.<br />Big Fish is a great film. Take the family to see it. It's an enchanting and fun tale full of stories and memorable characters. Come see one of the most memorable characters you'll ever see a movie. Big Fish is just simply fantastic and is something everybody should see.
B00008LDPV|4.0|....First of all , i'm writing this review cuz i did enjoy that movie..and certainly that means i'd recommend it for you people to see . <BR>so, The Animatrix was released parallel to the Matrix Reloaded ...it's an Animation movie made of 9 Chapters All separated from each other.each has it's own style of drawings and animation .Except for 2 chapters..<BR>THe Plot or the motive for the events of the Matrix reloaded is found in the Animatrix's first chapter..(the last flight of osiris )..as the machines are found to be digging 4000 meters above Zion ( the home of revolutionists ) to reach them..and it happened that Osiris which is another Craft like that in matrix ( nubukhadnasser ) has reported it before it crashes..which leads us to matrix reloaded..also a young man who newly appears in matrix reloaded , you'd find his story in chapter 9 ( a kid's story )<BR>...but all the above doesn't mean that The two movies completes each other..<BR>more you'd find in the Animatrix.. a historical archive about the reason of the Matrix..the reasons that led to Machines overtaking Earth and demolishing people's awareness of life..<BR>you'll find explaining some paranormal phenomenon like Ghosts on the behalf of the philosophy of the Matrix (in the chapter : Beyond )..Trinity's tries to find Neo ( a detective's story )..
0345452577|3.0|The Conspiracy Club started slowly, but kept my interest and turned into a page-turner through an exciting and surprising ending. Kellerman takes a break from familiar characters and the L.A. scene to introduce a new protaganist, who is a psychologist on the staff of a hospital in an unidentified city. There is a lot of potential for a new series here. Many times I felt as if I was reading a tale of a young Alex Delaware. However, I found the lack of real city with familiar streets and landmarks very disorienting. Secondly, Conspiracy Club, reminds me of a new house that has not developed any character. Kellerman's writing style seemed distant and shallow (like a lesser writer) particularly in the first half of the book. Basically, the protaganist has to analyze a series of clues, provided by a shadowy character who leaves the scene early in the book, in order to solve the puzzle of the identity of a serial killer. This is very interesting, but the number of hoops he has to go through seems very far-fetched and silly at times. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and recommend it to others. At the end of the day, Kellerman has written a solid mystery that would have been a great first effort by a new writer.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|This DVD set kicks ass. I think if you put the alien in the same ring with the predator - the alien would kick his sorry ass.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|A great adaption of a great comic series.  The story line does not completely follow the comic book but what changes are done don't affect the story.<br />It is a rarity where the sequal is better then the original and that is what you have here.  The cast pretty well fits the comic characters well I don't care for Hally but that is just me.  Hugh has the wolverine down perfect!  Nightcrawler is an excelent addition to the story line and I can't wait for see what they do when Jean becomes the Phoenix.  You are also introduced to Collosus!  The only wrong thing that may have happened is the fact he sounded American.<br />You don't have to worry about not seeing the first movie as you get follow the basic plot.  There are a couple references but it is not enough to leave you confused.<br />Overall it is a fun film and you won't get bored watching it again and again....<br />The extras on the DVD are ok.<br />Can't wait for the next movie!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have watched this whole 10 hour seris twice, and I am 2 hours into watching it a third time. It's that good. Matter fact, if I were to classify this as a movie, it would be, by far, the best movie I have ever seen. This series is 10 episodes, roughly and hour each, telling the TRUE story of the soldiers of Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airbourne. From paratrooper training with a useless commanding officer, a D-Day jump out of aircraft that were literally being blown out of the sky, fighting through France, Belguim and Holland, freezing but holding off constant German attacks at Bastogne, and being the first to get to Hitler's Eagle Nest, these men went through hell, together. It is an unflinching look at WWII through the eyes of several of the men in the company. Produced by Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks, it has the Saving Private Ryan Feel and covers the story of Private Ryan's (Matt Damon) unit. But make no mistake, this is 10 hours of the greatest cinema I have ever seen. You will follow several main charecters throught the war, some episode will be told through the eyes of a specific charecter. Others will be in third person, but there is not a single episode which I do not like. The acting is amazing, all the way around. The production is top notch, the special effects, camers and sound effects are flawless, this series is a masterpiece. It also has 80 minutes of interviews by the actual people how performed these heroic deeds. Look at all the other reviews and you will find that no one has a bad thing to say.
B00008PW2D|2.0|Since when does 8 episodes equal a season?  Way overpriced for what you get.  I actually had to check the case to see if it was defective.  What a total ripoff!
B00008OWZC|5.0|For those like me who were a tad to young to catch Zep live, this is a must have. It smokes the previous live release, &quot;the song remains the same&quot;. <BR>I actually read a review on here that simply said, &quot;This CD sucks, listen to good music like creed&quot;. Yeah, ok lamebrain, and while I am at it, I'll get out Coldplay, LimpBiscuit and all the other weak acts posing as musicians these days. Boy, they really rock. I think not. Creed isn't even talented enough to open for Dread Zeppelin, let alone the real deal. So now that you got your reaction, you can go back to bed cause your up way past ZEP time! <BR>The version of &quot;stairway to heaven&quot; found here features the band at its tightest, Pages guitar just takes you away to another place. The Bron-yr-Aur stomp even gets a new identity as John Paul Jones brings his mighty bass to new lows. Dazed and Confused never sounded better and to think these guys did this live. I can't think of an act today that could improvise for 10 minutes let alone 25. I found each song captured me in its own way. Theres an energy to these tracks that even surpases their studio counterparts. The mix is excellent with the entire soundscape filled with sonic bliss. <BR>If you always lamented the fact you never got to see these guys live, lament no longer. This is as close as you are going to get to the front row of a Zeppelin show. Enjoy.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|If you're looking for gritty, old-school rock and roll, buy this record.  Early AC/DC meets the Stones with a dash of late Beatles.  It sounds nuts, but it works.  If you're looking for pretentious, avant-garde poser crap, go buy another Strokes record and let it bore you to sleep.  So many of these new rock and roll revival bands are too busy trying to put a progressive spin on the music.  They forget the key ingredient.  Make it rock or get out of the way!  It's alive!  All the industry weasles and Justin Timberlakes can't kill it!  Rock and ... roll is alive!
B0000DD7LC|5.0|She is pure quality.  Her style is unique and very special. She is an artist that I would buy and recommend to other listeners who enjoy a variety, not too much hip and not enough hop!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I can't really lump this in with all the Matrix reviews because there's so much more to the plot in this one that it makes you forget the fact that there is some Matrix-type fight scenes in it. To put it straight to the point: if you loved The Crow, but thought of how much more could have been in that Goth classic, then get into this right away. <BR> Yeah, almost everyone had black trenchcoats on, there's a constant gloomy atmosphere (which I loved), and although Kate Beckinsale looks killer sexy in the black latex ..., she is a much better female hero of the movie than say, Angelina Jolie runnning around in the Tomb Raider movies. <BR> The effect as far as the battle between vampires and werewolves was excellent. Top notch special effects here-be sure to watch the bonus features to see the making of the werewolves-and the plot unwinds at a good pace, actually making you wait until the end to have it all reveal itself to you as you're caught up in all the action, horror, and fast paced scenes. <BR> Anyone into anything Gothic, horror related, and even action fans, don't let this one slip by you. It's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I bought it the day after renting it. <BR> And again, another plus to Kate Beckinsale for being the sexiest woman in tight latex, kicking ass with not one, but two guns! (And yes, the ending does hint at a sequel? I hope.)<BR> 5 STAR ESSENTIAL RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF DVD's.
6305232660|5.0|I thought Deep Impact was a great movie.  The storyline was so realistic and compelling.  The fact that Earth could actually be in Danger of that sort of catastrophe is really scary. The characters in the movie were so brave, bold, and couragous it made the film that much better. I never knew that Elijah Wood could act in any character other that Frodo in the Lord of the rings, but this movie proves that wrong. The movie was awewsome to watch and cry at.
0783235666|5.0|Very good movie. Superb. Alfred Hitchcock really made it good when he made this movie. I saw this when I was nine. When I saw the ending I was like, \\"What a rip off\\". But then I realized, since it was such a good horror movie, most horror movies are ruined by the ending. This one was just best left alone.<br />Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is a mistaken woman who has a lot of spare time on her hands. Maybe too much. Though she may be one for pranks, she decides to make a special delivery to Mitchell Brenner (Rod Taylor) with a present at hand for his sister who's birthday is coming up. Things start to become a little strange around the sleepy little town of Bodega Bay once she arrives. A gull swoops down and hits her for no reason. Crows are gathering around childrens playgrounds, and they even invade houses trying to kill people. Nothing seems to be adding up. Why the sudden change in the birds activity. What could possibly be going on that is making them go against humans? Maybe it was the humans in the first place.<br />The plot was really exciting in this one. When the birds attacked, it was just out in the open. There was no music which made it even stranger on account of you never really knew the mood of the present time until it happened. You weren't sure when they were, or weren't going to attack either. It took over 3 years to make this film with of all the trick photography at hand. For those of you who have seen this movie, the birds was supposed to have an alternate ending where the four survivers drive into San Fransisco and find it invaded with Birds. But Alfred hitchcock decided to cut it thinking it would give too much away. I would recommend The Birds II: Lands End also, because it was more of a make of the book instead of a sequel.
B00008OWZC|4.0|The problem with Led Zeppelin is that it can be repititious. I mean, we all know that Jimmy Page is a good guitarist, but sometimes you get the feeling that he doesn't stretch himself on most of hte studio tracks. Unlike, say Ritche Blackmore of Deep Purle (who is a much better guitarist by the way,) Page focuses more on riffing and less on soloing. This, to me, can be boring, especially if the writing is below par, as it sometimes is in Led Zeppelin's music.<br />On this two-disc set you get new versions of the Zeppelin's old songs which actually sound like Page is trying hard! Some songs sound better than those on the studio albums (although not Stairway to Heaven) and its worth listing if you like the band. Also, there are some cover tracks of old rock and roll and blues standards which Zeppelin play extremely well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After years of repeated sci-fi plots, ever present plastic wrap aliens, and the guys in the red suits always getting killed, a great Sci-fi show was once again spawned. Unlike star trek, which started goo, but is now mindless dribble in its.... Im not even sure what-th season, Firefly is innovative, and new.<BR>And Cancelled.<BR>It makes me wonder what kind if netwarok could even think of cancelling this show (and for that matter that superier John Doe in the same season.) It doesnt re use old clices, breaks them, and in the mean time makes other scifi look like, well you know that word. There are no aliens. There are lazers, but hteir so rare and expensive we pretty much never see them at all (twice. Only one of them works, and its batterys run out very fast! which makes sense, lazers are powerfulls, but how much energy do they take?<br />Firefly Is great, and for 11 hours of entertainment, very cheap. I remember the good old days, coming home from school and sitting down to watch some firefly and John Doe back to back... at least Firefly is on DVD, I can watch it any time... Ah bliss!<br />Now If only fox would put their other good (and cancelled) shows on DVD<br />cuz other then the simpsons and Malcom in the midle, they aint got nothin anymore!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let It Be was always my least favourite of the later Beatles albums and it was mainly because of the ochestration. It sounds different than George Martin's orchestration, which seemed somehow tighter and fit in better with the rock music. Phil Spector's orchestration seems more detatched from the main music and more echoey.<br />I think that most people who don't like this album say so out of nostalgia. After all, if you've listened to one version of a song, its usually difficult even to get into a live rendition or even the original version of a cover version.<br />This is the first time that For You Blue sounded good for me. The other songs also all sound good with the exception of I Me Mine, wherre the orchestration somehow worked, and perhaps Let it Be.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is defeniatley one of my favorites. I'm usually not one for subtitles, but it was worth it. Reading the subtitles was almost unnoiticible, and didn't distract from the movie's charm. Amelie is a hilarious movie about a 20-something girl who decides one day to become a regular good-doer, to help mankind. The film then takes you on an adventure through Amelie's puzzling love life, friendships, and her random acts of kindness. The message of the movie: Don't take life's simple pleasures for granted.<BR>The DVD included great, helpful extras as well as the disc. The best part of the movie was by far how beautiful it was to watch. The cinematography was excellet, every take could have been a bright, beautiful picture. The shots are so creative and cool, it ads so much to the already wonderful film! This movie is funny, cute, charming and I would reccomend it!

0679436391|5.0|This is Dickens at his best.  But your add said this was for ages 4-8.  As this does not appear to be an abridged addition, 4-8 years old is way too young.

B00005JL2O|3.0|Finally, the law of diminishing return has caught up with Austen's latest offering.  This movie is rather short compared with the earlier two movies.  It concluded at a mere 1 hour 24 minutes.  The tirade old jokes seemed to be running out of puff.  Whereas in the earlier offerings, we would be laughing our heads' off, in this instance, we might chuckle here & there.  There were many unexpected delightful cameo appearances & you could have mistaken the opening sequence to a John Woo's action movie.  I guess it's the charisma of Mike Myers that carried the whole movie.  The supporting cast was stunning particularly Michael Caine who showed his depth & versatility in acting.  I always fancied Roach's direction as his light-hearted & casual approach seemed to motivate the cast to improvise in their actings.  We have seen all the jokes & gags before.  Otherwise, this movie would be a blast.  I'm not surprised that this is the grand finale of this trilogy.  This DVD package is great as it offered many deleted scenes (on the hindsight, those scenes really don't add anything to the movie), documentaries about the production team, cast, choreography team, stunt team, vehicles sourcing team, special effects team, commentaries from Mike Myers, Director, Producer.  Even though this movie is mediocre, it's still a worthwhile movie to watch for a laugh.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a compelling book about a girl who risks her life to save her father.  Along the way she encounters many evil perils that force her to look inside herself and discover her true destiny.  This book is one of my favorites because it took me into a world of rich fantasy and breathtaking danger.  The world that Garth Nix created is extraordinary and lets your imagination run wild.  The plot is very captivating and keeps the reader transfixed for hours at a time.  As I look back on the book I do not recall ever being disappointed by any aspect of it.  I really enjoy fantasy books and have read many in the past, but I would have to admit that this is one of my favorites.  The book was astonishing and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure or fantasy books.

B00003CXV4|4.0|Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are reunited in this chick-flick. It's great to see them starring alongside each other again, after igniting the screen during Devil's Advocate. It's a similar situation to Devil's Advocate, but a different storyline, just extremely similar characters. Keanu and Charlize have a great terrific chemistry, and when you see them behind the scenes in the extras, they seem to get on well together. They're almost the next Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.<br />This isn't really a date film, a film you would go see with your boyfriend, as they would most likely end up slagging off Keanu's performance and then drooling over Charlize. This is a film you would go see with your girlfriends, or sit at home and watch alone, so you don't have to be ashamed of crying!<br />Both actors are great in this film, and both don't really have to stretch themselves much, as they've played these characters in the past. Some people will slag off Keanu's performance, but these people are just jealous.<br />There are a few very nice topless shots of Keanu, showing off his infamous scar on his torso and since it was around the same time as Matrix, he's still very much muscular and bulked up - gorgeous. Although not quite as bulked up as he was for Speed, just lots of definition.<br />It's not obvious to start with that Sarah (Charlize's character) is ill - sorry to spoil it, but if you've heard about this film, you'll know it's a tearjerker. She seems scatterbrained, and extremely dizzy, and likes dogs. As the film progresses, you notice little bits and pieces, and her face looking more and more drawn, before it gets discovered, by Nelson (Keanu's character). This film must have been hard for Keanu to film, as it's about cancer and a terminal illness. Any Keanu fan will know one of his sisters has had cancer on and off for the past few years, and although she was in remission, the cancer reappeared around the time of the Matrix films. So this film may have hit a chord with Keanu, he probably would have agreed to do it, just because of that, and not because it's a big Hollywood blockbuster.<br />The brilliant Enya backs some of the most romantic and poignant scenes in the film, and it really sets the tone of the film. I used to be a fan of hers when I was young, as the music is so peaceful and always makes me teary. I think I'll have to dig out my old album of hers - or buy the soundtrack to this!<br />This tops even Devil's Advocate, and both stars positively shine in this - just don't let your boyfriend see it, cos he WILL sit there slagging it off!ith Keanu, he probably would have agreed to do it, just because of that, and not because it's a big Hollywood blockbuster.<br />The brilliant Enya backs some of the most romantic and poignant scenes in the film, and it really sets the tone of the film.

B00004Z400|5.0|This album is nearly perfect. It's so good, in fact, that even the weak moments are interesting. So let's get those two weak moments out of the way. First, this album was re-issued about 6 months after its initial release with the first track (Back to School) added. Back to School is a rap/rock version of the (superior) final track. It works, in a way, because the tempo change and new lyrics emphasize the strengths of both songs. But it's also a cynical marketing plan that needlessly tested the patience of fans --- they already bought The White Pony the week it came out, so the re-release makes them buy it again for just one (not so) new song.<br />Second, this album is a little too long. Almost every listener will find one song that doesn't quite work. For me, it's Passenger, a duet with Tool's Maynard James Keenan. It should be amazing, but it's a little flat and uninspired. Other listeners will want to axe Teenager (very different from the rest of the CD), or Elite (which is packed with screams, a pure heavy metal track). (Personally, Elite is one of the best hardcore songs I've ever heard. It's so thick, it almost sounds like funk.)<br />With those exceptions, this is a flawless album. The Deftones  picked up where Jane's Addiction left off, comfortably working in the &quot;art metal&quot; genre without apology. In fact, these guys probably couldn't do it any other way --- they're too talented to be squished into the rap/rock straightjacket. Chino Moreno is best known for screaming like a lunatic, but if you pay attention, you'll notice that he spends most of the album whispering and singing beautifully. He's in the same league as Mike Patton, using his voice in unpredictable ways, adding drama to every song.<br />If you only have room for one Deftones album, make it this one. It's full of brilliant songwriting, veering back and forth between all-out noise and introspective beauty. I bought it over a year ago and it still sits close to my CD player, ready to gofour or five times a week.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a longtime Buffy/ Angel fan, I bought this DVD more out of curiosity than anything else since few sci-fi series have ever held my attention beyond an episode or three.  The first couple of episodes (pilot) of Firefly left me a bit cool -- this was OK, but barely snapping at the heels of Buffy in terms of cleverness and sense of mischievous fun. Once the warm-up over though, the series really kicks in and rewards generously. It's often laugh-out-loud funny and always perfectly judged, the characters are a joy each and every one and interact beautifully, the cast are spot-on, and there's not a single ludicrous rubber alien mask to be seen. With only four episodes to go, I'm completely hooked -- and there's the rub. These are characters that I want to continue to discover and accompany on their journey -- and yet it's not to be (unless the movie gets made and/or by some miracle the series gets recommissioned by somebody else). Instead, along with Futurama, the only other consistenly entertaining and intelligent sci-fi show to have graced our TV screens these last few years, it's gone out in a blaze. This is a series that would most likely have found its feet in the long run, attracting a large crowd of faithfuls like Buffy and Angel. Shame on the Fox honchos who didn't have the necessary faith in it.
B000002NIW|4.0|The Deftones' second album is a mix of good and bad. The worst thing about the album is the decision to make the final song, Damone, a hidden track. After the final listed song, MX, you have to wait 20 minutes for Damone to kick in. Both songs are great, but I don't have any interest in listening to 20 minutes of silence --- especially when I play the CD on random.<br />The remaining songs are either amazing art-rock or generic late 1990s heavy metal. Lotion, Dai the Flu, Lhabia, and Headup are okay, but they are far too generic. My Own Summer, Mascara, Rickets, Around the Fur, and Be Quiet and Drive are very good. Be Quiet and Drive is so good, in fact, that it's the kind of song that sends a band like this in a whole new direction. I wouldn't be surprised if they made a whole album like this song.<br />If you haven't heard the Deftones yet, you should start with The White Pony. But then come back to this one, just to hear the best half of this CD. You'll be glad you did.
0807282375|2.0|perhaps there was too much expectation after the first two great books but my feeling is that there were too many loose ends that weren't tied up.<br />The very complex issue of religion was always going to be hard and I feel it was handled badly.

Never happened in history just seemed a bit lame.<br />It really seemed to me like the author had written the book and then gone back through formulaically and inserted intriguing snippets that he could then close off towards the end.
B0000C8AUO|4.0|On reality Bowie is writing a record much like Earthling, that smacks withlive band feel, however, unlike Earthling, or most of his 90's music since Outside, this record has been produced to an almost 80's extent, little synth noises pop out at the listener along with annoying riffs which eventually bubble into the background, thankfully.  However the record has very strong songs, my favorites being Looking For Water and Fall Dog Bombs the moon, allthough most fo the rest of the sogns re very good as well.  the worst songs to my ears are Never Get Old, the title track and the final track, Bring me the Disco King, which I think really isn't the best track he's recorded in a long time, it really isn't.<BR>Now a few gripes about fans reactions to this and Heathen.  Most fans don't seem to be able to understand that these aren't his comeback records, Outside was his comeback album, and his best record in the past 10 years to boot.  heathen and Reality are almost throwbacks, records which sound like they were made to appeal to his fans, to get them to realise that he was makign good music again.  But really their not as good as Outside, they retreat from the edge, where Bowie truely is best, and go back to an almost 80sish comfort level, nothing is shocking or really difficult, it all seems very contrived and controled.  But at times greatness really shines through, on Slip Away and the title track of the last record, and on the ebst tracks on here, Bowie shows that he isn't getting old, he is most definatly making good music, but what he really needs is another young collabator like Trent Renzor or Suede or Placebo, and someone to say, let's not layer 10 synths at once and etc.  But this is all hearsay, I believe Bowie understands what he is doing, the final thing he played at Live by Request was I'm afraid of americans, and unlikely choice in a show dominated by the hits, but his choice, and reflective of his stance that his fans have to adapt with him.  Now one finalnote, listen to the maligned Tongith and Never Let me Down records, and listen to the the guitar sounds and Bowie's vocals, and then listen to Reality, and you'll be amazed, Bowie seems to have adapted the sound from Tonight, to try to make what are very good sounds and songs and idea, killed by production and boredom, and on this record make them new, and it works, the vocals and soudns and songs on this record are for the most part amazingly done, and to tell teh truth, I like the record alot, more than Heathen in many ways, the songs are stronger.  Anyways, this is a good record, no matter what weaknessess there may be.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Yes, you're right definitely Sean Penn should've had an oscar to his name. 'Dead Man Walking' proves it. Susan Sarandon is simply brilliant, it just makes you cry at the end. The way she holds out her hand at the time of execution, the way she looks at Matthew (Penn), are all simply brilliant. she certainly deserved an Oscar.
B000002JSN|5.0|Containing some of Zeppelin's very best tracks, \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is definitely worth the price of two discs. Like most double albums, it can get a little excessive... but if you've purchased their first 4 albums and still can't get enough, this is a must have! \\"Kashmir\\" is essential by itself and possibly the best song the group ever recorded... a majestic epic that fuses rock, blues, and middle eastern influnces... all the things Zep is known to do best!  Then there's the blistering \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" which has one of Page's best riffs of all time and a funky clavinet played by the multi-talented John Paul Jones. Plant is in top form on the spiritual catharsis of \\"In My Time of Dying\\" with John Bonham providing the raw energy all the way through. <br />Disc one is more consistent, but disc two offers a wide variety of gems such as the building ballad \\"Ten Years Gone\\" which offers some of Robert's best lyrics to date, the fun old-timey feel of \\"Boogie With Stu\\", the countrified acoustic track \\"Black Country Woman\\", and the wild \\"Wanton Song\\". Many of these tracks have the feel of b-sides (which is essentially what they were) and makes them even more fun to listen to. <br />One of the few double LPs to truly be worth purchasing (along with the Beatles White Album, Stevie Wonder's Songs In the Key of Life, George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, and Pink Floyd's The Wall), Physical Graffiti is the high water mark of Led Zeppelin's career.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|As the first few weeks of 2004 are upon us, and I'm sure Michael Jackson will be hoping that this year will bring him better luck than 2003 did. Despite dominating the tabloids with his appearance, the baby-dangling incident and THAT Martin Bashir interview, Michael Jackson still remains the King of Pop. There's some people who are famous. There are some people who are superstars. There are some people who are icons - and then there's Michael Jackson. Arguably the most famous entertainer alive, Jackson's 30 years reign on the charts is unchallenged.<br />So that's precisely why Michael's latest release, \\"Number Ones,\\" is essential for all fans of brilliant music. Since the early 1980's Jackson has captivated the world with his music. We've had fun dancing to his music and cried to his emotional ballads, and that's why he's the greatest male performer ever. His talent is undeniable, and even though he's gone a bit off the rails in recent years, the world and his die-hard fans have never forgotten the music which is what matters the most.<br />First off, Number Ones is a title that tricks the buyer somewhat. There are eighteen songs on this album, and Jackson has had no where near eighteen US No.1 hits. He's had a total of 13 US No.1 singles, and his last was in 1995. Michael has had 7 UK No.1 hit singles, and his last was in 1997. His first UK No.1 hit was in May 1981 with \\"One Day In Your Life,\\" which isn't included on here strangely enough. Michael's sixth US No.1 \\"Say Say Say\\" is also not included, and I have the UK version which includes \\"Human Nature\\" instead of \\"Man In The Mirror.\\" Silly different regions and record companies! What is the point? Why not just have a complete tracklisting?! Also, \\"Ben,\\" Michael's first ever US No.1, is included on the US version, but not on the UK version. Instead the UK gets \\"Blood On The Dancefloor,\\" Michael's last UK No.1 single.<br />Apart from these minor hiccups, all of Michael's biggest and most popular hits are included here. The album opens with \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" and \\"Rock With You.\\" Both songs are from Michael's debut album Off The Wall and both hit the US top spot. \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\" are up next and all from Thriller, Michael's signature album. 50 million copies shifted worldwide, and nothing's going to take over it any time soon! Up next, we have six songs from the follow up to Thriller. Bad was Michael's third album, released in 1987 and sold 25 million copies as well. The songs from Bad on here are \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You,\\" \\"Bad,\\" \\"Smooth Criminal,\\" \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" \\"Man In The Mirror\\" and \\"Dirty Diana.\\" All these songs were huge hits and all were US No.1's, apart from Smooth Criminal.<br />After this we get \\"Black Or White,\\" which was a huge US and UK No.1 hit. It's the only song on this compilation album from Michael's fourth album - 1991's Dangerous. \\"You Are Not Alone\\" was one of Michael's biggest hits ever, and is next on here, followed by Michael's biggest selling UK single, \\"Earth Song.\\" No.1 for six weeks and shifting more than 1 million copies this masterpiece is a perfect world peace anthem. Michael's 2001 comeback single \\"You Rock My World\\" follows. It wasn't a No.1, so by rights it shouldn't be included here, but it's a great track, so why not? \\"Break Of Dawn\\" wasn't even released as a single, so it's got no excuse to be here! It's from Michael's trans-atlantic chart topping Invincible album from 2001. \\"One More Chance\\" is Michael's latest single, and will not top the charts by my 'expert' predictions. \\"Ben\\" closes the album, which goes back to the very beginning of his career.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 8/10<br />I think it was a wise move for Michael Jackson to release Number Ones. It provides new fans in their teens a chance to get to know Michael's best music, for those who were too young to be digging it when 1995's \\"HIStory\\" was released, because let's face it, even people in their early teens love Michael's music! I think some minor adjustments could have been made to the tracklisting to improve this album, but it's still not a bad collection and definitely worth the money. Upon its release this album didn't even crack the US Top 10 - Britney stormed to No.1 that week, but in the UK, Number Ones did just that, and went straight to the top of the charts! All in all a brilliant record to add to any Michael Jackson collection.c!

B0000VCZKM|5.0|God I was born when this movie first came out to theaters and I remember when my mom rented Annie for me when I was little and I was just like WOW by how great this movie was. When I was in school we put Annie the play on and no girls tryed out so I got the part of Annie so they changed it to Andy and I tought everyone the lyrics to TOMARROW-HARD KNOCK LIFE-SANDY  and meny other of the great songs this is sure to be the best DVD to own fun for all ages I should now I'm now 21 and I still love watching this movie
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album is uninteresting, unoriginal, unaesthetic.  This album is the audio version of her recent publicity - distasteful, erratic, and simply unimpressive.  Spend your money elsewhere.
B000001OAA|5.0|Too bad Garbage's music started leaning a little too much into the Britney Spears sphere for my tastes after this album (musically that is - as in plasticky dance-pop). I hardly ever listen to VERSION 2.0 although BEAUTIFUL GARBAGE does have some good songs on it.<br /><br />This self-titled debut, however, is the real deal. GARBAGE is edgy even when the music's soft. Shirley Manson is downright menacing. Her persona is generally not one you want to mess with. \\"Vow\\" is positively venomous. She sounds like a spurned lover or a psycho that's been burned, bent on revenge and as relentless as the Terminator - \\"I can't use what I can't abuse/ and I can't stop when it comes to you.\\" \\"Not My Idea\\" (\\"of a good time\\") is another female revenge scenerio (\\"You thought I was a little girl/ You thought I was a little mouse/ You thought you'd take me by surprise/ Now I'm here burning down your house\\"). It's one of the best and the music can really take you to high places.<br /><br />\\"Supervixen\\" and \\"Queer\\" are snakey and sexy, \\"Queer\\" being the big hit and very dancable. I always skip \\"Stupid Girl\\" and (old?) \\"Dog New Tricks.\\" Take these 2 out and this is a 5-star album no question.<br /><br />GARBAGE has a distinct negative bent, but by the end Manson is \\"afraid she'll never get to Heaven\\" and makes a half-hearted attempt to change on \\"Fix Me Now\\" (\\"Things don't have to be this way\\") but she wants someone else to change for her. \\"Milk,\\" the last cut, finally immerses the listener into a sensual world where Manson waits for  . . . . . you, actually.
0613624688|5.0|\\"Lirael\\" is neither the beginning nor the end (thank goodness) of this remarkable fantasy series by Garth Nix.  If you haven't already read \\"Sabriel\\", you might want to put \\"Lirael\\" aside and begin at the beginning.  The middle book could stand alone, especially the story of Lirael herself, but you will miss nuances of the Philosophy and Geography of Death if you don't start with \\"Sabriel\\".  The only work I can compare this series to is Philip Pullman's \\"Golden Compass\\" trilogy, although I prefer Nix's magical world-building.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles his immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br />One fault should be noted. The two main characters spend too much text feeling sorry for themselves.  Lirael pursues an impossible dream, while Prince Sameth tries to escape from an impossible nightmare.  I think the author's editor must have read \\"Sabriel\\" and said, \\"Garth, this is a great fantasy but your heroine, Sabriel is pretty darn self-sufficient.  Readers can't relate to that.  You need to make your characters more vulnerable.\\"  So that's exactly what Nix did in Volume Two.  Vulnerability often shades over into self-pity in \\"Lirael\\"---too often for my liking.  It's not enough of an annoyance to bypass this fantasy.  Hopefully, in the yet-to-be-published &quot;Abhorsen&quot;, Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.<br />Garth, I advise you to stop listening to your editor.  You were pitch-perfect in \\"Sabriel\\". Retune `Astarael, the Sorrowful' that \\"casts all who hear it deep into Death\\" and finish this marvelous trilogy the way you began it.take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.

B00000DG1R|4.0|Back in the 80's I went through a period where I shunned Duran Duran for being a wimpy \\"teeny-bopper\\" band. But that was mostly an image I projected. Secretly I was entranced with the \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" video and the slinky, sexy \\"Union of the Snake.\\" By the time the equally slinky & sexy \\"Notorious\\" came out, I realized these dudes were actually good musicians, if very pretty ones. Certainly not virtuosos, they still could (can?) craft great dance/pop songs (and I have the NOTORIOUS album which is a step toward a more mature sound and quite good).<br /><br />So I picked up GREATEST this year because I actually started to crave hearing these songs again. Putting it on the stereo was truly a guilty pleasure. I realized these songs have kitsch appeal which I can appreciate. The kitschiest song of the bunch has to be \\"Wild Boys,\\" a song that felt like an affront to my blossoming manhood at the time it came out. Now it's a riot. \\"A View to a Kill\\" is still exciting. They captured the feel of a James Bond track deliciously on that one. \\"New Moon on Monday\\" is another favorite in which Simon Le Bon apes Bowie before launching into his trademark soaring vocals. And even a jealous punk kid like me could feel and understand why the girls melted when they heard \\"Save a Prayer.\\"<br /><br />Some tracks from their more recent output don't quite measure up. \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\" could've been handed to Madonna for her LIKE A VIRGIN album, while \\"All She Wants Is\\" and \\"Electric Barbarella\\" amount to chilly disco. But that's not really so bad and the tracks do maintain a certain 80's sound. OK, \\"Serious\\" is pretty bad, but their early 90's comeback singles \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone\\" are excellent and will surely stake their place on FM radio for years to come.<br /><br />And we can't forget they were as freakin' hot as the models they routinely dated (lucky devils). Their whole package - the videos, the music, the lifestyle - was enticing.
0451204530|1.0|Not worth the paper it is printed on<br />One of the worst books I have ever read...and I read a lot.  The author uses a well-worn plot: spies from Russia against the spies from US.  Yet he cannot make any of it credible.  Everything in this book conforms to your worst expectations. Shallow characters, stereotypical actions, simple plot.. The plot is easy to enough see from the beginning of the book...It has short sentences and a fluent writing style that make it an easy read...Still what a waste of time....I was interested in this book because of its context in late 50's space exploration....but I learned almost nothing on it from this book....<br />If you want to read a good spy book, read John Carre.  If you want to read a good book, read Hemingway or other equally great writers.  Don't waste your time on this book.
B00005JMFO|5.0|The film was truly excellent.  I laughed, I cried, I felt warm and fuzzy all over.  I don't want to ruine any of the twists this film takes for you so I won't go into too much detail but near the end they do something incredible with all the characters.  It was an honest to goodness feel good movie with some rather interesting characters and events.  I have been into and around Heathrow Airport more times than I care to remember and never saw it quite the way this film made me see it now.
B00008H2LB|4.0|When the Hybrid Theory CD was released, I was really impressed with its completely new and different sound.  Meteora, Linkin Park's 2003 release, is exactly what I was hoping for from LP....another vesion of Hybrid Theory.  <br />I know people say that bands should change, that they need to \\"grow\\" musically, and I think that's usually true for the most part.  But right now, I wanted more of the same from LP, and got it.  <br />After listening to this entire CD many times, I find that I give 3 songs the most airplay in my car.  From the first time I heard the album, \\"Don't Stay\\" is my favorite song on the CD.  Nice heavy riffs.  \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is probably the best written song.  I think the ending is terrific (I'm glad LP decided to keep their 30th iteration of the song's end).  My newest favorite is \\"Lying From You\\", as I find myself playing this song in my head at work all day long.  Again, great riffs in the chorus.<br />Good tracks throughout the whole album. Highly recommended if you liked Hybrid Theory.<br />\\"Erase all the pain 'till it's gone\\"

B000006CCG|5.0|There were hair bands and then there was WASP! This CD in particluar was one of the first i ever bought, there really is no bad song on it, all the songs are killer from start to finish. Highlights include &quot;B.A.D.&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be Somebody&quot;, &quot;The Flame&quot; and one of my favorties &quot;Hellion&quot; which includes the the lyric; &quot;the gods you worship are steel, at the altar of rock n roll you kneel&quot; Truly W.A.S.P is one of the best and most underated metal bands of the 1980's. They are the reason Tipper Gore will never sleep well again.
0375432302|3.0|First, the good news: this is a really enjoyable book to read.  I found it to be so much fun that I read the whole thing in less than twenty hours (including breaks for sleeping and meals).  If you're looking for some light, entertaining suspense, you won't be disappointed.<br />If, however, you're interested in questions about theology, biblical criticism, and the like -- read with caution!  This novel might as well be subtitled &quot;Literary Adventures of the Jesus Seminar.&quot;  You'd do well to read Lee Strobel's &quot;The Case for Christ&quot; as a companion volume, and you'd do even better to read &quot;Jesus under Fire,&quot; edited by J.P. Moreland and M. Wilkins, before and after picking up this novel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is one big premise that you have to swallow in order to like this show. If you can't cope with it, you won't like it, because it will smack you in the face in every episode.<br />It is like the James Bond movies, if you don't accept, as a premise, that Bond, James Bond, can do everything, fly, drive, shoot, use *every* piece of machinery on the planet, that he can shoot better than all his advesaries (who all miss, all the time) and gets *all* the babes, if you don't accept this, you have to hate James Bond movies, because they are ridiculous. We talk about suspense of disbelief.<br />The one thing you have to swallow, without thinking about it, is, that in this particular science fiction universe, the future looks like this:<br />You have core planets, which are like one would imagine future worlds: Big, beautiful buildings, hight tech gadgets, spaceships and shuttles, modern weapons (some that don't kill by using some kind of sonic boom), flat displays, a modern, digital credit system instead of localised currency, a totally diverse people influenced by every imaginable culture, heavily influenced by the chinese society, the only remaining superpower besides the USA and so forth.<br />But, and this is a capitalized BUT: There are also the outer rim planets. They don't have a developed infrastructure and such. Settlers are dumped on planets with next to nothing, exploited to recover raw materials, used as cheap labor, trying to survive. Still sounds reasonable, no? The catch is: all these outer rim worlds look like you have been thrown into a cheap spaghetti WESTERN movie.<br />They trade cows, they use old revolvers, drive horses and dress in western-style garments. You have little, old, dirty small villages with a saloon and stuff. These outer rim planets, out of reach of the civilised Alliance, are a no-mans-land, with superstitious, uneducated fools, where the strong fist rules - if you have the most men and guns behind you, you are the law. The poor grunt is like the cowboy in a typical western movie.<br />Hard to accept? Partially yes, of course. But there is logic in almost everything: there are future references everywhere! Real food (as opposed to synthesized proteins) is a rare commodity, the RICH guys have laser guns or state of the art display devices. <br />And - they stay true to this premise throughout the show, which is a rare thing in today's entertainment.<br />But apart from this (for some) hard to accept premise, this show is the most entertaining, clever, realistic(!), funny, imaginative, creative, thrilling piece of entertainment I had the pleasure of viewing (by downloading it from the internet) in years (don't get me wrong: I downloaded it because I live in Germany and the show was never aired here, and I asked my brother, who lives in the USA, to get me the DVD as a christmas present - and he did)<br />As for realism: Why do they still use guns to kill people, why not lasers like in Star Trek (which i am avid fan of)? I say: guns kill people, bullets are cheap. Guns get the killing done. (And there are modern (bullet) guns and lasers in the show, they exist, they are simply not widespread and only available to the rich.<br />No sound in space -  a little thing with big impact. Not only is it realistic, but it adds to the atmosphere. Instead of ridiculous sound effects the scenes in space are underlaid with vivid music, only emphasising the vastness and nothingness of space.<br />The basics of the universe comply with our world. In the outer rim, where modern civilization hasn't gotten a foothold yet, things - which are to us - common, are valuable merchandise! Just imagine the third world... How much worth are medicine, guns, food there? There are (to us) barbaric customs in uncivilised areas of the world and all this is being portrayed in the show.<br />The Plots are great, not like in Enterprise where you seem to have seen everything somewhere before, these plots are unique, thrilling and exciting. I have seen episodes where I thought \\"ok, I get it\\" and then *wham* the story turns into a totally different direction. Surprises at every corner. <br />The show is so refreshingly politically incorrect, I don't want to give away plot details, but there are situations you know from your movie/series experience and think OMG there we go again (Hostage situations someone?) and then*boom* - the protagonist does EXACTLY what WE would wish to do but which every movie/series is afraid of doing because it is not PC.<br />The characters are three dimensional and so well laid out. This \\"family\\" on board a little spaceship, a confined space(!), with all their motivations, quirks and problems, trying to get along and achieve their goals, are so believable and make for a hell of a ride.<br />The creators of this show have, in the first 14 episodes, established plots, characters and atmosphere that other science fiction series have only managed to achieve - if ever - in the last seasons of their time on air.<br />Such a pity that most American viewers couldn't see behing a bold, unique, hilarious - if difficult to accept at first glance - premise... and see the beautiful gem of a show behind it.
B000001GK9|5.0|I own this recording since several years, and have continuously compared against others: Bernstein, Zander, Abbado, Walter, Barbirolli, to name a few. And man, no matter how I twist and turn it, I ALWAYS come back to this one. And each time just to realize: This IS the BEST out there. Period.<br />I have reviewed this recording already before (&quot;For eternity&quot;, see below), and it is unusual for me to write a second review (actually, it is the first time). But this recording is different, and demands an exception. <BR>I once heard Sir Simon Rattle say that everything about Mahler should be seen as being totally Viennese. And here I re-listen to this recording, only to suddeny realize: This IS the difference. Sir Simon is right! This recording, it's energy, it's rhythms, it's movements, the underlying &quot;waltzing&quot;, it's entire style and attitude, it's fragility (1st movement), burleske (Laendler, 3rd movement) and shining optimism (4th movement) (Karajan was Austrian anyway) ARE totally Viennese, from the first bar to the last. It is as if Karajan listened to Rattle (How is that possible?), or vice versa?<br />Anyway, as mentioned. Now, with some more experience,&quot;for Viennese eternity&quot;.
B00005JMCT|2.0|In this third and final installment in the &#34;American Pie&#34; trilogy, Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are planning to get married. Jim, still as disaster-prone as ever, must convince Michelle's parents that he is worthy of their daughter's hand and go to great lengths to give his bride the wedding of her dreams. Stifler (Seann William Scott) plans a raunchy bachelor party, while he and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) both try to woo Michelle's younger sister Cadence (January Jones), who is in town for the wedding.<br /><br />&#34;American Wedding&#34; was directed by Jesse Dylan, who is new to the &#34;American Pie&#34; franchise. It was written by Adam Herz, who created the characters and wrote the original &#34;American Pie &#34;  movie. So it's a little surprising that &#34; American Wedding&#34; possesses none of the charm that the first film did. &#34;American Pie&#34; succeeded, not only because it was funny, but because the characters were lovable and their plight sympathetic. Jim, Finch, Stifler, Kevin, and Michelle are back for this film, but their characters are barely written. If they convey anything at all, it is pathological self-importance. Stifler was always an egomaniacal jerk who had an inflated opinion of himself, and that was funny. In &#34;American Wedding&#34; he is too obnoxious for words and comes across as actually being mentally ill, which isn't funny. The jokes are forced. The situations are less believable and consequently less entertaining than in &#34;American Pie&#34; or &#34;American Pie 2&#34;. There's nothing in &#34;American Wedding&#34; that will strike a chord with the audience as being an authentic, if exaggerated, take on the emotional or social experiences of young people today. It's just bad writing. Eugene Levy, who added so much to the first two &#34;American Pie&#34; films, is wasted on this one. His lines aren't funny. The unrated version of the film contains extra footage from Jim's bachelor party. More boobs, essentially. How can you have a bunch of young men and two barely-clad women in a room and.... nothing funny? Lots of cleavage, little writing. Recommended as a rental only if you've seen the first two and don't want to be left ignorant of the conclusion.<br /><br />The DVD: On the downside, there are 3 previews which cannot be avoided. Happily, both the R-rated theatrical version of the film and the unrated version are on the same disc. Bonus features include: deleted scenes, blooper reel, a featurette on &#34;Stifler Speak&#34;, a featurette on the making of &#34;The Bachelor Party&#34; scenes, a &#34;making of&#34; Jim's grooming scene. And there are two commentaries, one by director Jesse Dylan and actor Seann William Scott, and the other by actors Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kay thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas. If you really like Stifler, you might enjoy the &#34;Stifler Speak&#34; featurette. And there are more boobs in &#34;The Bachelor Party&#34; piece. But, truthfully, these are appropriately uninteresting bonus features for an unfortunately uninteresting movie.ially.

If you really like Stifler, you might enjoy the &#34;Stifler Speak&#34; featurette. And there are more boobs in &#34;The Bachelor Party&#34; piece. But, truthfully, these are appropriately uninteresting bonus features for an unfortunately uninteresting movie.
B00005JLCE|5.0|This movie is such a fun ride.  The songs are great, the situations and jokes are hilarious and Madonna is both cute and crazy. Also, there is a cougar named Murray that adds to the fun. I wonder what it would be like to pal around with Nikki Finn for a day...??  Well, atleast you can pal around with her for the hour and a half of this movie.  This storyline is somewhat based on the film \\"Bringing Up Baby\\"(1938)starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant.  I love both movies.  I totally disagree with anyone who bad mouths this movie (including those crusty critics).  Not everyone wants to watch a \\"Gone with the Wind\\" epic-type film that will win Oscars.  You should know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch this, in other words if you can't stand Madonna then don't watch it.  I, on the other hand love her and this movie is one of the main reasons why I do.
B000000OU4|4.0|This is as close as Pat Metheny and his group ever came to easy-listening or background music. Yes, the best Metheny CD to play in your car. Of course, that does not diminish the album's quality -- improvisation reaches climactic heights of &quot;To the End of the World&quot; and the pounding title track could well serve as a dramatic score for a great figure-skating showpiece. Lyle Mays' composition &quot;Episode d'Azur&quot; is most probable to satisfy jazz purists among the album's listeners and riveting closer &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; surely won't send you to sleep. Yet, the predominant mood here is a groovy, almost r&amp;b-like drive -- witness the peacefully subtle &quot;And Then I Knew&quot; and almost poppy &quot;Something to Remind You&quot;. A very interesting feature of the booklet is a list of personal favourites for all members of the PMG line-up. &quot;We Live Here&quot; was at least the seventh Metheny's album to receive a Grammy, awarded for Best Contemporary Jazz Performance of 1995.
0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill by John Grisham is truly a 5-star book.  Grisham tells the story of a young lawyer fighting for the life of a man who murdered his daughter's rapists.  Being a unique story line, any reader could be grabbed by a description but the book itself is what truly shines.  Every detail is crisp and accurate.  Grisham's characters are incredibly life-like and he makes you pray for their best resolution.  Every page makes you want to read the next.  Every chapter brings you closer to the resolution but doubles the suspense.  Once I started reading this book I could not put it down.  Grisham truly shows that he is a master of courtroom suspense and that he knows what he's talking about.  Along with having an incredible plot, Grisham also sends a great message with this book.  He reminds people that even though slavery has been abolished in the U.S., racism still exists all over the world.  Jake, the lawyer defending Carl Lee, sets out not only to get a boost in his career, but also to prove that a black man can recieve a fair trial in a predjudiced court.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|It seems that most people write the reviews based on whether they like Britney of not. First I would like to point out that reviews are meant to give another person an idea of how the item was like after using it. It is NOT whether you like the artist or not. Because of those people the ratings become highly inaccurate. I would like to try my best to write a review based soley on whether this album is good or not.<br />I really liked this album. It has a variety of songs in it. Best Britney album yet. I loved all the songs, so it's hard to pinpoint, but I liked toxic, touch of my hand, shadow and every time. I think she could have done without brave new girl and the remix. They are more like filler materials. Brave new girl is the kind of the song you would expect on her 1st album. Overall, I liked this album. You should add it to you collection too!
0385504209|4.0|I am not one to sit down and read a 400+ page book, but I was indeed possessed to do so and I picked it up and read page one - then I was hooked!<br />It is a fasciniating murder mystery that gripped me from the git-go. I found it to be written well - an easy read, yet it engaged my intellect. The book is well researched. I can't even begin to imagine the amount of time and effort that went into researching and writing this book!<br />I will also tell you I loved the ending. It wasn't corny or sappy, but it felt real. It ended in a way that I was satisfied and not left wishing for a different ending. It felt good when I was done.<br />Mr. Brown did an excellent job on this masterpiece. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an interesting and gripping read.
B000002J6F|5.0|I bought this album in 1972 and have listened to it almost weekly ever since.  It is the best cruising music ever made.
0767818040|4.0|Lord, yes, it has problems, but get real, you wannabe filmmakers who never dared pick up a camera or risk your own money: there is nothing around better in American film than the wonderful/comic/goofy/ecstactic moment when Craig Wasson and Deborah Shelton suck each other into  that 360 moment at Marina Del Rey with Pino Donaggios' wonderfully over-the-top synthesizers crackling like sparklers. Yes I love my Ozu and Welles and Shrader and Bertolucci, but for all of DePalma's weaknesses, he knows a good image and he understands obsession. And had sense enough to hire a good composer.
0345440757|5.0|My children are 14 months apart and are now 3 1/2 and 27 months.  This book was just out right before my 2 year old was born.  My friends and I (19 children under age 4) all wish we had this when our first ones were born.  She does not judge you, she helps you.  The sleeping through the night recommendations are child and parent friendly (read 5 sleep researcher books in addition to this one).  The breast vs. bottle feeding combination actually works and the only place I have ever seen it.  No matter what get the page where it tells you what physical actions could indicate what conditions.  For example, pulling legs up to stomach and high pitched scream, check for gas!!!  Considering I have the un-grandma as my mother, I really needed this.  It was as if I had a wise old grandmother at my side.  Highly recommmend it.
B00003CXSM|1.0|Another example of art imitating life! Why do these dumb men keep falling for JLo stank tail?
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have previously never been a fan of Britney Spears- I personally don't like pop music, &amp; from what I'd noticed, all of her old songs had no real edge or uniqueness. But I listened to a few of her new songs and was amazed at how much her music ability has changed. I still don't think she has the best vocal range, however she's experimented a lot on this album and it has had a great turnout I think. &quot;BREATH ON ME&quot; is a wonderfully haunting song that is easy to dance to and her vocals on this song are great. &quot;EVERYTIME&quot; can be compared to other pop-love ballads, however it has a chilling undertone to it. &quot;TOXIC&quot; is another great dance tune with good beats and different ranges throughout the song. I give this album a thumbs up and I hope she continues to get better each year, to prove the skeptics wrong.
B00005JMCT|1.0|The gross outs were fun in the first film, the second was ok but this one just reeks! Nothing new here &amp; half the cast is missing. It just came off very awkward &amp; very tired.
0385504209|1.0|This book was an easy read, thankfully, or I would have given up. It so is full of such nonsense presented as &quot;researched, documented, historical fact&quot; that it was really hard to stomach. The anti-Catholic bias of this nonsense reaches ridiculous proportions. I mean, come on: for the last five centuries we have been taught that the Catholic Church was evil precisely because it had PERPETUATED goddess worship in the form of the cult of Mary and the saints. Now we are supposed to believe that the Catholic Church is evil for exactly the opposite reason, that it SUPPRESSED goddess worship? I guess any stick will do, when the game at hand is Catholic-bashing. But the most disturbing thing about all this is the book's popularity! Thanks to Dan Brown, psychiatrists in North America can look forward to to treating yet another generation of &quot;the Catholics are out to get me&quot; paranoid delusionals.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Carol Burnett really steals the show as a crazy drunk who runs an orphanage! This wacky lush tries to bed every man she comes in contact with &amp; it is hilarious! The lil girl playing Annie is ugly, but it is cool that Lex Luthor adopts her and the mangy mutt.
B000002GQE|5.0|Most people first heard of the The Moody Blues in 1972, when \\"Nights In White Satin\\" received a lot of airplay on the radio.  However, this album was released at the end of 1967, but did not receive the glowing reviews it got until years later when it was accidently discovered.<br />The album has musically euphoric high points (Tuesday Afternoon) and depressingly sad low points (Nights In White Satin), but there is a lot in between.  I think that this is an album that you will remember exactly where you were when you first heard it, and you will have memories of your own life at the time you first heard it that come to vivid life when you listen to it again and again.<br />Each of the five band members that made up The Moody Blues at the time contribute something to this album.  Graeme Edge's meditative poetry at the beginning and the ending of this album, Mike Pinder's slow and forlorn songs (Dawn Is A Feeling, The Sun Set), Ray Thomas's happy and whimsical songs (Another Morning, Twilight Time), John Lodge's rock and roll songs (Peak Hour, Evening Time To Get Away), and Justin Hayward's songs that made the album a hit (Tuesday Afternoon, Nights In White Satin).  Also, the orchestral interludes that are in between each song are what I think are some of the best parts of the album.<br />It does seem strange that this album did not become a hit for The Moody Blues until they had released The Seventh Sojourn, but this seven album period was musically their very best
B0000A1RJI|5.0|The music that Klaus Badelt has created for this movie is as amazing as the movie itself.  He manages to capture the mystery, romance, suspense, and humor into a moving, flowing score.  His use of meter and dynamics create an emotionally intense musical atmosphere, and while the order of the songs may be a little off, the music itself is enough to bring to mind the best scenes.  This is a definite must have for any fan of instrumental music.
B000002LEU|5.0|When I was a little girl, my Dad would always listen to Joy Division. At the time I was kind of freaked out and I really did not enjoy the music. As I grew older I appreciated the music more and more. The best music evokes memories, be it painful or wonderful. Whenever I hear \\"She's Lost Control\\" I am always reminded of one of my close friends and her problems. However the creme de la creme of my Joy Division experience will always be \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart.\\" As a small child I had no idea how love could tear someone apart and as I grew older, and experienced love for the first time, I finally understood what Ian Curtis was trying to say. What I love about the song was that it could be sung by a man or a woman and have the same emotional power. As a writer I find it interesting how different writing styles between the sexes is so apparent. However the song is so raw and heartfelt I can never listen to it without crying. This review is very biased towards my childhood but I would highly recommend this CD to people who are looking for raw emotion and powerful lyrics.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is a quick read about a man who is condemned by the fact that he is different.  The society around him, and unfortunately many who simply read the book, do not even try to understand him.  <br />He appears to be an emotionles man without morals, yet upon closer inspection it is seen that it is not that he has no morals or emotions, it is just that his interpretation of the world is different. <br />Though he commited a murder, the trial ends up being more about him as an individual, and in this respect it is unjust.  They refuse to try to understand him, even though he tries repeatedly to explain himself.   In a rampage toward the chaplain, Meursault wonders, \\"Couldn't he see?\\"<br />This is a sad story about the narrowmindedness of society and the unfortunate individual who gets caught up in it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let It Be... Naked, is one the Beatles best albums.  Phil Specters's version wasn't up to snuff in my opinion.  This version sounds way better than the first.  Don't really expect much out of the second disc because it is about 25 minutes of cuts from other jams in the studio.  This album is definetly one their better ones, so this a must for new beatle fans.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm really getting sick of all you reviewers who can't do it properly.  We don't want, &quot;Linkin Park's the best band ever!!!&quot; and no details.  And we don't want, &quot;If you want real rock, go get... and if you want real rap, go get...&quot;  All bands sound alike if you use that philosophy.  Hybrid Theory is the first and best by Linkin Park, with hits like Crawling, One Step Closer, In The End, Papercut, and Place For My Head.  Yes, most of the songs take a rap approach.  However, if you REALLY search for &quot;good music&quot; you would listen to all the songs and not say that Linkin Park is crap with no talent.  Linkin Park introduced a new variation of rock... many other bands have a lot of rap too, and I don't hear you talking about them.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|That may sound like a contradiction, but I got the feeling that this just-out-of-the-club album was the direction she really wants her sound to go in.  And, for that sound, it's a great album.  <br />The only weak songs on the album are the ones that go against that sound, the ballads.  \\"Shadow\\" is particularly weak, a watered-down Aerosmith ballad from 1988.  Another weak one, \\"Outrageous,\\" I expected to be a lot better, based on the R.Kelly production, but it was just a tribute to excessive living and spending.  More than that, it went against the \\"I'm just a normal girl\\" vibe that I got from the rest of the album, as well as her previous ones.  \\"Brave New Girl\\" sounds more like Hillary Duff than Britney, but as pop-lite, it's not bad.<br />Her strong songs are much more impressive.  \\"Toxic\\" is fantastic, catchy, edgy, and fun.  I've heard that that's the next single and it's a good choice.  \\"Me Against the Music\\" isn't as strong as \\"Slave 4 U\\" from the \\"Britney\\" album, but it's got a harder edge than the earlier singles and a very strong club beat.  I don't think Madonna's presence made it any better than it would have been otherwise, but she was okay.  The remix (also featured on the album) wasn't great, just not different enough to justify being a second song.  \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\" has become one of my favorites on the album.  Fun, funky, sexy, and though it sometimes sounds like the Ying Yang Twins' song (who, frankly, sound like Ludacris), rather than Britney's, it's really good.  \\"Breathe On Me\\" is a great slower dance song, as is \\"Early Mornin',\\" which benefits from Moby's production.<br />This is a very interesting album, and fun besides.  I painted my apartment to it and it was perfect for that.  Bouncy, sexy, not too deep.  If this is where Britney is going and she can get a cohesive production team next time around, I look forward to hearing it.
B00005QW5X|5.0|With a soundtrack to match, this film has touched my heart to the core.  Not just another cut-and-paste medly of the old familiar George Clooney and J.Lo romantic comedy antics, this film takes cinema to a new level.  What happens when a person is physically incapable of experiencing love?  After a botched sex-change operation, Hedwig is an example of strength and and beauty.  This song is an anthem for anyone and everyone who has ever wanted anything more than the average middle-American white lifestyle.  Simply beautiful.  Simply breath-taking.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|can't tell you how much i loved this series.  humorous, witty, intelligent, and NOT A REALITY TV SHOW!
B00004Z4SD|4.0|The film is a real look at what it is like in middle america.  The People more than anything want to succeed, and they will do whatever it takes to make it to their goal.  The Main Charactrer goes through anything that he can to get to see his brother.  It causes you to look back at your life and see if you are working hard to do things you need to or if you are blowing them off.  I am giving it 4 stars only because there is a ton of slow moving scenes in the film, but otherwise it is great.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album rocks!  Period.  My Immortal is now a favorite, even if it is a Ballad.  Amy Lee has a great Voice. I could go on and on.  If you like rock.  Then buy this cd.
B000002MJC|5.0|I guess very few people really understood this slow-digestion piece of art. It has a perfect combination between the message they're trying to transmit and the music envolved in every step of the album. As the tracks go forwards, you can feel the suffering in different levels... and after several times of listening the entire work, you finally understand why the title &quot;songs of faith and devotion&quot;. I'm not trying to depreciate any other album, nor any opposite opinion, but I've listened to all of DM (From Speak&amp;Spell all the way even through a tango Version of &quot;Told You So&quot;... )and I still believe that this is the deepest, most touching and revealing work they've ever done. I put my faith in it...
