B0000029AL|5.0|AEROSMITH (1973) was released to little fanfare and publicity, but it undoubtedly did wonders for Aerosmith in the long run - even if you just credit the band's success to one really popular song.<br />Many hungry, young bands had problems getting their feet off the ground in the 70s (of course that's even the case today), especially a group whose lead singer was labeled as a Mick Jaggar wannabe. Funny, too, because even though this album failed to catch fire in 1973, Aerosmith - led by faux Mick Jaggar - went on to become the greatest American rock & roll band of all time. Now, 30 years after the release of their debut album, Aerosmith is going back to its roots with their March 2004 release, HONKIN ON BOBO. HONKIN ON BOBO will sound a lot like AEROSMITH - bluesy. Aerosmith always has considered themselves a blues band of some kind, and AEROSMITH proves just that.<br />The opening track, \\"Make It\\", tells you everything you need to know about these young upstarts. What's fascinating is that \\"Make It\\" honestly was the band's birth song. Just listen to Steven Tyler in the opening lyrics. He says, \\"Good evening people welcome to the show/got something here I want you all to know.\\" Funny, ain't it? 30 years later, and we're still welcomed to the shows.<br />\\"Dream On\\" is obviously the one song every music listener identifies the band with. Surprisingly, the song had to be re-released in 1975 after Aerosmith finally made it big with their third album, TOYS IN THE ATTIC. \\"Dream On\\" was the band's first-ever single, but it simply never really got much airtime on the radio. Of course, when it appeared as a single the second time, it became a smashing success.<br />\\"Mama Kin\\" has one of those riffs that is something of a measuring stick for those aspiring guitar players out there. It's still one of the band's most popular songs when played in concert. \\"Somebody\\" is another gem - bluesy (there's that word again), just like \\"Wag The Dog\\", a Rufus Thomas cover. \\"Write Me A Letter\\" and \\"One Way Street\\" also follow that same bluesy theme. Sure, you can say the band was trying to find its sound and that Steven Tyler's voice didn't have the same veraciousness as it does as he got older, but you cannot deny the true raw sounding, shake-your-butt grooves this album sets off. \\"Movin Out,\\" perhaps the lone, hard rock song of this album is also the first song ever written together by Tyler and Joe Perry. Hearing this song for the first time will blow you away.<br />Some may not agree, but I recommend this album to anyone. More casual listeners will be familar with the band's commercial success - that is anything from 1987 until now. But AEROSMITH is a must-have for any fan of rock and roll. And if you love Aerosmith's music, even if you don't own any of their music, you have to purchase their debut album. Simply put, you have to appreciate the band's legendary status, and to do that, you need to own this CD. AEROSMITH is a treasure.<br />*Make sure to remember my name when searching for Aerosmith music. I do consider myself an Aerosmith historian, and I assure you that you'll find some great reviews posted by me before you make the decision to buy an Aerosmith CD*
B00005JMFR|5.0|I give the movie and the series 5 stars.  I will not elaborate on any of the other 5 star reviews, I will simply emphasize a previously made point.<BR>In order to understand why this movie and series is worthy of 5 stars, you MUST see the Animatrix and play Enter the Matrix.  These other media types contain information central to the main plot.  Unfortunately it is that simple.  If you do not see/play these other items, you cannot possibly understand some of the main points in the movies.
0345451325|5.0|I purchased &quot;The Fall of Reach&quot; two years ago now, yet somehow didn't read it until these last three days. And that's as long as it took to finish it. I read about 100 pages a day (which is a lot for me, take my word for it). I have beaten the game many times and always felt that something was missing. I wanted more information on the characters, the Covenant, and Halo itself. I am pleased to say that Nylund's novel does an excellent job of conveying this information. I was deeply enthralled with the character of Captain Keyes, who plays a much bigger role in the book than he does in the game. Similarly, learning about the creation (and imminent doom) of the AI Cortana was beyond interesting. Despite the fact that I knew the Master Chief was the only Spartan who would survive, I still felt surprised and sad when the other Spartans fell. Nylund uses an excellent narrative voice for this genre, the vast Naval spaceship battles between the Human and Covenant fleets are told with a level of detail that keeps your eyes frantically focussed inches away from the page, constantly anticipating the next word. After finishing this book, I felt empty: I was disappointed that it was over. Don't get me wrong, though, this is a good feeling to have; it means it was a damn good book.<br />As good as it is, there are a few things to note. Though this is a petty, insignificant complaint, I found many typos throughout the book, sometimes forcing me to stop and think it through to find out what it was really supposed to be. However, this does not degrade the overall experience of reading the book. Also, it is doubtful that this book will be half as interesting to a non-fan of the game. For any Halo fan, however, this book should be required reading.
B0000A1RJI|1.0|I'm going to make a list of all of the soundtracks that Klaus Badelt blatantly ripped off of with Pirates. If I forgot any, notify me and I'll add it:<br />First off, the most obvious:<BR>Gladiator -  this one is at the top because the main theme is almost an exact copy of the one from Gladiator.<BR>The Rock - same as above.<BR>Drop Zone<br />Now, the less obvious:<BR>Crimson Tide<BR>Shrek<BR>Black Hawk Down<br />Any more? Please tell me<BR>Alan Silvestri was much more qualified for the job than this theif. But now that I mention it, he wasn't the ONLY ONE involved in this now was he? NO! Just about every Media Ventures student was involved in this massive load of crap (the inserts read like a yearbook), including Zimmer himself, who HAPPENS to have written Gladiator and alot of the Rock! What happened to ORIGINALITY?! Do I smell another James \\"Self-Ripoff\\" Horner? Time will tell.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I am- or perhaps I should really say I used to be- a big fan of Britney's, but after shelling out for this crapfest I am a bit sick of her. It doesn't seem that she's getting any more talented, she's just losing more clothes. Sure Christina Aguilera is no where near the squeaky-clean Genie in a Bottle days, but she has the vocals and songs with somewhat of a message to back up her metamorphasis. Of the songs that had any redeeming quality to them, I couldn't help but think they would've been better if someone was singing them (one-Breathe on Me- was more suited to Kylie Minogue and I swear another-Brave New Girl- would've been better for Hilary Duff- how scary is that) . . .am I the only one who finds her voice really annoying these days? Oh yeah, and Madonna- what the heck were you thinking? Seriously- with all the money and power behind this thing they couldn't come up with anything better than the idiotic and pointless cameo she had? It seems to me less of a coming together of musical genuises as much as two people who are brilliant marketers/self-promoters, talent-be-damned.
B000063DIH|5.0|From what I've read of other peoples thoughts on this album i was pretty disappointed to read that so called &quot;die hard fans&quot; didn't like this album. I would like to think that i am a die hard fan of maiden and i personally loved this album. TRue, it doesnt measure up to Number or powerslave but it is still not one to be overlooked. Here is a track by track line up and what i thought.<BR> Be Quick Or Be Dead- , Heavy ,Hard hitting, Maiden on top form!<br /> From Here to Eternity- The fourth song in the charlotte series has kinda anthem qualities  with the way that pretty soon you'll find yourself singing the chorus for days afterwards.<br /> AFraid to Shoot Strangers- INCREDIBLE. HAS TO BE HEARD TO BE BELEIVED WORTH BUYING THE ALBUM FOR ALONE.<BR> <BR> Fear is the Key- Kinda iffy song but still pretty cool.<br /> Childhoods end- Love this song very serious meaning but is stil damn cool.<BR> <BR> Wasting Love- I usually skip this song dont know why though its actually pretty good. NIce melodic guitars.<br /> The Fugitive- Love the drumming here and like &quot;here to eternity&quot; the chorus will stick. Another great song.<br /> Chains of Misery- This song is wicked. Extremely overlooked, unfortunately though compared to the real standouts on this album it isnt anything really. Put this on another metal album and it wouldve stole the show.<BR> <BR> The Apparition- I really really REALLY hate this song. Its one of those long ones where nothing much happens and the tones dont vary and theres nothing new all the way through. Lyrics are really good though shouldve done this one like Rime of the ancient mariner on powerslave.<br /> Judas Be My Guide- One of my favourites on this one. The lyrics, the timing, the guitars, the chorus, everything is amazing on this song.<BR> <BR> Weekend Warrior- This is a really cool song dont skip through it to get to fear of the dark has another catchy chorus on it like &quot;eternity&quot; and &quot;fugitive&quot;.<br /> Fear ofthe Dark- Way too Publicised but stil an amazing song. Sounds weird when it isnt live like on all other albums with it on.<BR> <BR>  For those of you who thought Bayleys time in maiden was useless. Give his Silicon Messiah a try and see that he is actually a very talented singer and if you havent already buy powerslave and number of the beast they ROCK.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|Okay, I think that you can stand the fumbling bumblings of Hugh Grant in this movie.  This movie is sweet and has a feel good message.  I found it pretty enjoyable.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I dont have HBO so i have to rely on the seasons coming out on DVD and i was disappointed on how many episodes were on each disc. I asked for the set for Christmas and felt bad for my boyfriend for spending so much money on almost nothing. I love Sex and the City but not for 40 bucks. I agree they are worth renting, not buying. Not much really happened and i would have been better off saving money and waiting until the 6th season comes out.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|The album isn't terrible, but it's not all that good either.  It seems being The Strokes has proven to be a terrible burden for the boys who sound tired and bored on this album.  They haven't developed as a band and a fan's fears have been realized.  This album sounds like a collection of songs wisely omitted from 'Is This It?'  Now cliched musings on how fast life is moving figure in successive tracks on the album so the boys aren't even bothering to mask the album's unoriginality.  If you like that Strokes sound, check out The Buzzcocks.  Far better to listen to The Strokes' inspiration than The Strokes without it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Thought this was quite a lovely film, certainly the best of last year (liked 28 Days Later too, to show you where my tastes are). True, the Japanese stereotypes (esp. in the first half) are a bit jarring, but you can, if generous, dismiss them as there to highlight the Bill Murray & Scarlett Johansson characters' cultural confusion. Other than the two's exploration of downtown Tokyo, nothing much happens. We watch as they gradually find themselves approaching some appoximation of lovers. If you want a conventional 'plot' or 'lovestory' it's best to avoid this film. Get the latest Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan vehicle (or an appoximation thereof) instead. If you're willing to explore a little (as Bill & Scarlett's characters eventually are) then please watch this film. As a long time fan, FINALLY  the worthy use of the mighty Mary Chain (RIP)'s music in film.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Personally,I had heard about 7 of these songs before I bought the album. I know that everyone says that Britney can't sing and Britney has no range,but I still think this album rocks. This album is full of great dance and pop songs. My personal favorites were: Slave 4 U,Overprotected,Anticipating,Cinderella,Boys(though I liked the Co-ed remix better),and Bombastic Love. The only songs I don't like are I'm not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman and I Love Rock and Roll. Even with those two tracks,this CD still deserves 5 stars because the music is catchy and fun If you read the whole  thing, thank you!!! and I really hope this review was helpful! :) :)
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist has not aged well, mostly because the special effects in this movie look extremely dated because of its 1973 heritage, however the story is still solid, the acting on top form and the dialogue is one hundred percent satisfactory.<br />If you want to learn a lot about the making of this film then I highly recommend a book called The Exorcist by Mark Kermode which is part of the BFI Modern Classics prints which is almost like reading a 100 paged review of the film. Certainly fans will enjoy that. The film is based on the book The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty which itself is based on a true story of demonic possession. Those of you who like this film should read the book if you can. The book is also just as scary and maybe even more so.<br />The premise is quite cerebral. A young girl starts to exhibit violent fits and her actress mother watches slowly in horror as her daughter becomes possessed by an evil spirit. Doctors can not cure her and so instead turn to the Catholic Church for help. A local Jesuit priest who is also a psychiatrist is having a crisis of faith. He goes to study the girl and discovers something diabolical at work. An older experienced exorcist is appointed to perform an exorcism which will leave the viewer reeling long after the credits come to a close.<br />Mostly this version of the film is a re-edit of the original with several restored \\"lost\\" scenes and some restored cut scenes. A new scene is restored at the start featuring the home at Georgetown where Regan, the possessed girl is living. The music has also been altered here. There is additional music added to Father Merrin looking at the statue at the start of this film. Most of the University movie scenes included re-recorded new dialogue. A new scene where Regan meets a doctor for the first time has been included. The phone call scene to Chris's husband is now missing the swearing. Regan's scene during the party has been cut - she no longer laughs in that scene. The infamous X-ray scene has more background dialogue of doctors talking to Regan. The scene where Father Karras lies in bed drunk has had the dialogue reedited. The nut grabbing scene has an extra facial demon effect inserted along with new sound. Just before Chris discovers that Burke Dennings has been murdered there are several demon statues seen about the house (the stove, door and Regan's wall). Chris's reaction to Dennings death has been swapped for a new cut. The infamous \\"Spider Walk\\" scene has been restored for this version. A long period of blackness is added to the film after this scene. New music had been added to conversations between Kinderman and Karras. A long shot of Karras's sermon in church has been added. The tape recording sequence has some additional scenes of Karras listening to the tape. When Merrin receives the telegram, new music has been added. More scenes have been added to Merrin's arrival at the house and the preparation for the exorcism. More conversations between Merrin and Karras about the demon have been added. The exorcism scene has been mostly reedited with additional sound effects and special effects. The medallion scene has been altered so that Dyer gives the medallion back. Regan also waves goodbye to him. Dyer and Kinderman have a new reedited conversation in the end.<br />In short this is a whole new version of the Exorcist and is certainly worth watching. Just make sure that you read the book too!us X-ray scene has more background dialogue of doctors talking to Regan. The scene where Father Karras lies in bed drunk has had the dialogue reedited.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD really surprised me. I bought it thinking it would be \\"pretty good\\",but not superb. MAN,WAS I WRONG!!!!!!!! This CD is an amazing CD that is my absolute favorite! I enjoy all the songs on this album. Just listening to Walk Away gives me chills. Her voice is superb and she sounds MUCH MUCH MUCH better than she did on  her debut album.  If you want an amazing CD,buy this NOW! It's worth every penny. I promise you, you will listen to this more than once! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO BUY IT!!!!
B000002KKS|5.0|Wow. This album, I mean CD, brings me back to 1980. I was a huge Sabbath fan at the time. I loved everyhting they did. I remember seeing this in the New Release section of the record store and was psyched. Then I flipped the album over to look at the names of the songs and was shocked to see no Ozzy! How could there be a Sabbath without Ozzy? Oh well, I thought. They were a good band while they lasted. Then a friend of mine bought the album and called me up to tell me how good it was. He was a casual Sabbath listener and I thought it was only for those who &quot;kind of&quot; liked Sabbath. Boy, was I wrong! He brought it up and I was totally blown away. Yeah, Ozzy's voice was missing, but here was a new, vibrant, heavy, youthful sounding Sabbath. I couldn't believe my ears. Fast, full throttle rockers, slow churning, heavy rockers, melodic interludes, and the signature Sabbath crunch of Tony Iommi's guitar. (By the way, I believe some of his best work is on here) It took a while to get used to Ronnie James Dio's vocals in the mix, but it was worth the wait. As for the lyrics, Ronnie brought in a bit of mythological mysticism with enough dark undertones to make for some exciting new songs.<BR> I will always love this album. It heralded in a new, albeit short-lived chapter of Black Sabbath history. It was sad that the line-up didn't remain because I believe they would have been the biggest act of the decade, even eclipse Ozzy's success (which was sadly due only to his drug and drink influenced behavior and not his new musical direction. Sorry Ozz, but it's true) Anyway, this IS Sabbath, like it or not. It rang in a new decade of heavy metal music and was THE album that broke the floodgates open for the NWOBHM that was to follow. Buy it, enjoy it. It's great heavy metal and it's great Sabbath.
B0000027RL|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I don't consider Pearl Jam grunge. They're just from Seattle and they came out in the early 90's and had a heavy alternative sound. I don't see any relationship between Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Anyway, this is a great album. \\"Jeremy\\" is a song that has a very important story behind it that always makes me cry. In fact, most of Eddie Vedder's songs have stories behind them and the way he sings them and the lyrics that are written for them are great. A lot of people don't like Eddie Vedder's voice, but I don't care. This is a great album. Give it a listen if you're getting into alternative music...
B00006RIO7|5.0|Love the CD, Love the Movie, Loved it all
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This is seriously the best CD I have.. I love it so much... there isn't a song on here I don't like and it is so relaxing to listen to. I can't count how many times I have listened to this CD and everyone should buy it!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|When you watch this you will be hooked. the performance of pacino is as if tony montana himself would be on your screen. many go in it for the violence and the drugs. however what many fail to see is that this film is great because of pacino and nothing else. you forget he is pacino during the film. thats how good it is. i recomend it and suggest you watch it with different perspective.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The most romantic relaxing music I've ever heard.  Norah Jones calm soothing voice combined with wonderful lyrics to hold that special someone close and lose yourself.
B00000JGHM|5.0|For the first time in cinematic history, two of americas most elctrifying actors collide in HEAT. Pacino, Deniro, and director Michael Mann make this film unforgetable. A detective hunts down a master scoresman and his expert crew who will take on anything from stock info in armored cars, metals from deposits, and even banks in broad daylight. dont make a mistake. deniro isn't mr nice guy, but you cant stop rootin for him.<br /><br /> some of the best directed action scenes and the best chemistry on stage between Pacino and Deniro. plus a truckload of other actors like val kilmer, tom seizemore adn ashley judd, which make this film even better.<br /><br /> the ending will surprise you, but you cant help but like it.<br /><br /> Dont get this movie wrong. its not any action movie. its a wondefully directed and acted masterpiece about A Los Angeles Crime Saga.<br /><br /> 5 stars
B00003CXB2|5.0|This spectacular DVD release of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is the first edition to do true justice to this masterpiece of the cinema. Not only do we get the fully restored Director's Cut, complete with the full orchestral introduction &amp; entre'act, letterboxed to view the full magnificence of the picture, the sound has been remastered wonderfully, &amp; the picture itself is sharp, vivid &amp; alive.<br />David Lean's remarkable film gamble starred two complete unknowns, Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, &amp; Omar Sharif as Ali. His gamble payed off big; O'Toole inhabits the role of Lawrence so completely that he even resembles the &quot;real&quot; Lawrence quite closely. Sharif's Ali is introduced in one of cinema's most famous scenes, an endless long shot across the desert.<br />There are many fine reviews of this film, most of which are much better than I can write. This collection though, is worth mentioning. The additional features are excellent, although sometimes redundant; the archival &quot;shorts&quot; that were used as advertising in 1960/1 are extensively recycled through the hour long documentary on the restoration of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; Still, they are fun to watch. The documentary itself is quite good and very informative.<br />This film is one of the greatest ever made. This edition is the best yet. No home that owns a DVD player should be without &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;!
0783225792|5.0|Very good follow up. Not the same as Goodfellas.    Deniro never dissapoints in movies with scorcese.   Pesci plays a great follow up charater too.    Deniro though is what makes this movie great.    i reccomend it 100%
B0000A98ZP|3.0|The Breakfast Club is a damn enjoyable film. It stands out as a classic of its genre, the '80s teen movie, the &quot;brat pack&quot; flicks exemplified in the films of John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). In Hughes's world, the grown-ups are exposed as morons, and here it is Paul Gleason as high school Principal Richard Vernon (&quot;Does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe?&quot;) as the token object of humiliation.<br />In The Breakfast Club, five students find themselves thrown together for a Saturday detention. Throughout the course of the day they fight, they cause mischief, they laugh, they cry, they get high, and they wind up discovering that as different as they are from each other on the surface -- the rich kid, the geek, the troublemaker -- underneath they're the same ordinary kids going through the same ordinary struggles.<br />You may have to ignore some of the amoral implications of the story to appreciate it. And you will have to find it in your heart to forgive the cheesiness as Hughes presents every cliche of his era one by one. Overlook some of the utter implausibilities and absurdities the film throws at us. This is good fun that puts adults in their place for a while and reminds us that &quot;kids&quot; are human, too.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Deserved the Oscar Nomination it received. the real life story of police officer Frank Serpico who was never corrupted, not only shows drama in the everyday life of this man, but shows Pacino at almost his best collaboration with Lumet. almost as good as in Dog Day Afternoon. if a Pacino fan or just a movie lover, you cannot miss this film.
0810945797|5.0|I just happen to own the original 1985 copy of The Dark Crystal.  To be honest I never knew it's value for content and that it went right out of print.

B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein caught my attention from the song &quot;Du Hast&quot; and i started listening to them.  Herzeleid is a pretty bold sounding album, but its still one of the best cds in my collection.  They have sort of a metal-classy music, and it sounds really great when they go together.  Buy this CD and just listen away.  The first song &quot;Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen?&quot; is kind of ...weird at the beginning, but after that the songs blow you away.  If i could i would give them 10 damn stars...
078401213X|5.0|PI - Darren Aronofsky's 1ST Feature Film / U.S. 1998 (4 STARS) <BR>November 2003: I truly enjoyed this B&amp;W film - symbolic of Film Noir from the 50's (Touch of Evil and The Trial), but more technically savvy. It is a masterpiece in control, and a director's ability to create mood - in the true spirit of independent cinema style, in display with all it glory (and gratuitousness).<BR>* Mise-en-scene: The figure behavior of Max Cohen appealed to me - strange, erratic and inconsistent - it furthered the narrative to establish a man truly on the edge.<BR>* While I did not feel personally for Cohen's character, I enjoyed being a voyeur and following his track to see where he would end up.  My goal was very narrative driven and I don't think the director's aim was for us to empathize with the character - it was more to get us interested in him -which we do quite acutely.<BR>* I did not particularly care for the gangster angle, but I guess it was important to keep the less-artsy crowd hooked on and to drive the narrative forward in a linear fashion.<BR>* Cinematography: The mood was built both by the choice of wide angled lenses used at very close distances to distort the images and give the `crazy world' feel. Camera height is used effectively to convey an impending feeling of something waiting to happen or lurking around the corner.<BR>* Sound &amp; Editing: The director's total skill and control on these two stylistic elements is what makes this film an imperfect masterpiece. I so enjoyed the complimenting of the sound bridges to give the impending feeling of foreboding. Yet the sound was hip and a departure from earlier noir works where it created only mood. The editing was totally maverick and the mixing of superimpositions with quick and flash cuts gave a more music-video feel which was fast and slick - thoroughly enjoyable in the end.
B00008PW2D|1.0|This is a joke.  I still do not understand why HBO didn't combine season 5 with season 4 and have it be a 4 disc collection.  To charge $30 + for this abbreviated season is a complete scam.  I think I will wait until they release the box set to get season 5 on DVD - I recorded it and can watch the video if I feel I need to see these forgettable episodes again.
B0000057C5|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD SO MUCH I TRY NOT TO TOUCH MYSELF.  BEST RAMMSTEIN CD EVER.  A MUST BUY!
0385512104|2.0|A lot of the reviews here seem to confuse the ability to portray the life of an autistic with the ability to write a compelling novel. I appreciate the skill it took to do the former, but the _story_ itself is weak. Without giving too much away, your average reader should figure the plot out pretty quickly, and the novel becomes a drag soon afterword.
B000001EEN|2.0|Great songs, too bad the recording quality is poor.
B00008PW2D|2.0|HBO has found a cash cow with these girls, which I think is why it released this pathetic attempt at a season for the same price as a regular length season.  These scant 8 episodes are not engrossing and the writing is rather poor.  The full bodied wit and the quality of the first four seasons is conspicuously absent here.  I don't know if the writers are burned out or what, but each of these episodes is just, well, &quot;off&quot; for some reason.  Overall, this box set (if you can even call it that) is not a good value, even if you are a fan of the series (which I am).
B00005JLRT|2.0|When watching this film at the theater I almost walked out. It really seamed not to be a Star Trek film and certainly not one of the Star Trek The Next Generation films. Something there is missing, the now classic characters seemed bored and very boring. As with Generations I didn't care for the lighting which gives the Federation ship a very dark look. The film was promotted as the film with the vilian as good as Kahn, should be because he was a carbon copy. When are they going to just release a good story that doesn't have a vilian?
B000060MMI|4.0|This is a very good cd. Flogging Molly, a group similar to Dropkick Murphys, the Real Mckenzies, and The Tossers is NOT what you guys are saying &quot;Celtic Punk.&quot; There's no such thing. It's Boston Irish Punk. Keep in mind they're not directly from Ireland.
B000069AUI|5.0|Deep soulful lyrics, haunting melodies and incredible instrumentation.<BR>  Coldplay blends the sounds of U2, Oasis, Dave Matthews and Radiohead and turns out wicked track after wicked track, of one of the best new albums I have ever heard in a long, long time.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I have to say I'm rather disappointed by this production. Maybe it works well in the theatre (I didn't see it at the Metropolitan). However, it doesn't work too well on video. Both the production and stage direction are stodgey and the acting is of the elementary kind. I don't think the singing is too inspiring. Maybe Wagner isn't that suitable for me, but this production definitely fails to arouse my interest in Wagner's music and drama. It doesn't work for me.

Susie Salmon watches her family fall apart, her true love as he tries to cope, and her murderer covering up his tracks.  At first I thought this would be a murder mystery, told from a different view, but a murder mystery nonetheless.  No one could have prepared me for the raw emotion rolling through the pages.  I am sure Sebold's experience in rape added to the heartrending tale.  This is a book that will certainly cause you to consider the good things in your life.  As some would complain, the ending does come together nicely, but I was struck by the irony of the neighbor's murder.  I think Sebold goes further than many authors would dare to go, not being afraid of the cruel events that people try to avoid.  The message Lovely Bones portrays will stay with you forever.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who is ready for a 'lovely' yet harsh novel.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|After the first Listen to Say You Will... I fell in love. It is definitely different, compared to most Fleetwood Mac albums (with the exception being TUSK). I was so impressed, that I insisted on seeing them on tour this past fall. Despite the absence of Christine McVie, the group isn't struggling by any means. They are more hard rocking, a more masculine sound, but without losing the beautiful ethereal quality of some songs, and keeping the amazing instrumentals... Lindsey is a guitar God!
0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown uses the research of others and passes it off as is own.<br />This book is nothing but a murder mystery weeved into the Holy Grail myth already written in \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" That book came out 20 years ago! Brown makes no mention of this book in interviews nor is it featured on his own website, because it would hurt his own book's business.<br />Someone called Brown a charlatan on one of the reviews. I think that sums up his characther very well.  So he's getting rich off the work of Richard Leigh and others who put their life into research of the Grail and the Ancient Scrolls.<br />The murder mystery is terrible and just shows that when Brown is not rehashing the research of others that he is incapable of fabricating a credible fictional plot or characthers.<br />I give this book 2 stars only because its the kind of book to recommend to those who do not read and they will like. It also serves as an inspiration to others that ANYONE can write a bestseller.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|I absolutely Love this CD set! A must have for any Fleetwood Mac Fan!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is definately her best album ever.  It's very different from her others I think and it's gotten away from some of that teeny-bopper dribble.  Her voice is also pretty good on it too. I have a friend who absolutely hates Britney but got this cd for a present and listened to it and she actually likes it.  <BR>Toxic is one of the best songs on it. Its very cool and upbeat and sounds a little bit from the 60's. Breathe On Me sounds like a good club song. Shadow showcases Britney's voice amazingly. It shows she does have some range on her. Brave Girl has a good beat and is kinda funky. Everytime is one of the best songs. It is very beautiful w/ just her, the piano, and a string arrangement. She did an awesome job writing this cd!! These songs make you want to get up and dance actually. This is definatly her best cd. So if you like any of her others, you'll love this one.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|As Soon as I walked out of the theatre, after seeing POTC, I was in love. The soundtrack is gorgeous! I knew I was getting it for a Xmas gift, so I had to wait forever to listen to it again... and when I did, I fell in love all over again! Klaus Badelt is amazing...
0440234743|5.0|I had seen John Grisham's work put onto screen, in A Time to Kill, which was a very moving story.  I decided to grab The Testament out of the school library. I never put it down after that.  The first chapter hooked me, with the old man killing himself leaving elven billion dollars to an mysterious unknown heir.  I kept turning page after page, amazed myself of how fast I was going through the book.  After every chapter I would read the first line of the next chapter only to find that i couldn't stop. As Mr. O'Riley was trying to find Rachel Lane, the greedy childre, ex-wives, and lawyers were becoming more and more anxious to find where the money was being placed. I think the end was a well needed twist and top it off just perfectly, with everything turning out just right.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|I am a lover of all things Beatles. However, my preference is for McCartney and nothing else- as far as solo career's go. However, this was a Christmas gift and I am very surprised and thrilled at the gift. This program was so well planned, thanks to Eric Clapton and Olivia. I was very appauled at the quality of the tribute for John that Yoko and Sean did. This would make the &quot;shy&quot; one very proud. The talent that was on stage was amazing. A must have for any Beatle FAN!
B000000WF0|5.0|I heard the song Bittersweet Symphony on the radio and I was hooked. I got the CD as a gift and I was hoping all of the tracks would be as good (as bittersweet symphony) and I was not dissapointed. The only song I don't particularly like is Sonnet, it was a little slow for me but everything else is brilliant. I especially like Catching the Butterfly and Rolling People. This is a must-have CD if you enjoy melancholy/touching alternative music.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is the best of the three Lord of the Rings soundtracks.  Howard Shore surpasses his previous work, interweaving familiar themes with complex new sounds.  The music for Minas Tirith is awesome and Shelob's Tunnel is a great reminder of Peter Jackson's experience with horror movies.  Of course, Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen enrich the experience.   I keep this one in my car to keep me going on those long trips.  By far one of the best soundtracks this year.
B000065V9Y|5.0|This album is just amazing.<br /> Comoing off the heights of his previous album &quot;SO&quot; Gabriel pulls off a great follow-up album with lots of African drums and dark exotic rhythms.<br /> My favorite songs are &quot;Digging In The Dirt&quot;, &quot;Blood of Eden&quot;, &quot;Only Us&quot; and &quot;Secret Woorldd&quot;.<br /> Whoa, this album is just amazing. I love every song on here.<br /> Buy this CD 2 Day!
B000000OQF|5.0|Its easy to slam GNR these days, i mean they're just a washed up hairband that nobody cares about. But when it comes down to it very few bands have made pure rock n roll in the last 20 years as well as GnR has. After spinning this baby it will be hard to get Axl's melodic screeching and Slash's juicy solo's out of your head for atleast a few days. Appetite for Destruction is the epitome of empowering balls-to-the-wall rock music.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I too received this DVD as a Christmas (I think many people did) and was very impressed with both the audio and video. The love everyone on stage had and still has for George is evident. Clapton acoustic guitar work with Ravi's orchestra is unbelievable, and Billy Preston's rendition of My Sweet Lord is moving and brings the crowd to it's feet. For Harrison and Beatles fans this concert is not merely viewed but is experienced. Excellent, kudos to Clapton for putting this event together.
1401200613|4.0|The average comic fan struggles between trying to \\"look\\" mature and giving in to their childhood fantasies. Having said all that, the average comic fan is actually far more intelligent than most people think. I mean, the world is only now discovering things like the \\"Matrix\\" films and these are things that comic readers have taken for granted for years. <br />I, and many like me, have been \\"seduced\\" by the intellectually satisfying and literary rich writings of post-modern comic scribes like Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison and Warren Ellis. These masters of deconstructionist, post-modern writing always seem to come up with new ways of reinventing the entire comic genre. However, all that said, there is still that part of me that is a lot less cerebral and a lot more visceral... or more romantic. It's that part of me that gasp with bated breath when Green Lantern takes his oath or when the Batman swoops down unto the roof of the GCPD in answer to Commissioner Gordon's call. And for that, I turn to Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's \\"Batman : Hush\\".<br />Jeph Loeb doesn't pretend to be what he's not. He's not from the fraternity of \\"2000 A.D.\\" British writers who deconstructs superheroes to show them for the fascists they really are. Jeph Loeb is a romantic - of the \\"Casablanca\\" sort. He loves superheroes and it shows in his works (check out \\"Superman For All Seasons\\" and his Marvel \\"color\\" books for further evidence). And here in \\"Hush\\", we have Loeb writing a story that I believe he himself wanted to read. All the best writers write for themselves... for their own pleasure rather than for the approval of a board of critics. In short, Loeb writes as a fellow fan to fellow fans who want to see a great Batman-Superman bout, a Batman-Catwoman romance, a Batman-Joker fight-to-the-death, etc. - you get the point! More than that, he writes for the artist. In this case, Jim Lee. Jeph Loeb is as much a fan of Lee as many of us. So he writes the scenes that he himself (and mostof us) wants to see Jim bring to glorious life with his pencils. For example, who doesn't want to see Poison Ivy drawn by Jim Lee? <br />That brings us to the artist. Need I tell you that Jim Lee is the creator of the highest-selling comicbook of all time (X-Men #1)? Need I tell you that Jim Lee is the founder of Wildstorm? But more important than that, we respect the man for his art - which can be summed up as merely a strong sense of the human figure and tight, super-detailed backgrounds. Having grown up with his work on X-Men and Punisher, I must say that he has improved greatly here on Batman, giving us (dare I say it) the most definitive Batman since Neal Adams in the 1970s. All that is brought to glorious life by the tight inking work of frequent collaborator Scott Williams and colorist Alex Sinclair.<br />This first of two volumes collects the first five parts of the Hush storyline along with an introductory \\"origin\\" of Batman told from Alfred's perspective. Jeph Loeb provides the foreword himself and the book includes biographies of the creators. I gave it four stars instead of five because the paper is awfully thin. Seeing that this is a hardcover collection of the highest-selling comic of 2003, D.C. should have used a heavier paper-stock - like they did on the wonderful Green Arrow hardcovers. <br />All in all, I recommend this book for those who grew up with Batman and those who would like a taste of the \\"real\\" Batman apart from the awful movies.
0446608955|5.0|This story is marvelous!  It's actually based on the author's sister's life. Part of it is about &quot;not judging a book by its cover&quot;, only it's more touching! If you cry easily reading books, grab tissues.  Sit back, relax and prepare to be heart-warmed, touched and enjoy the ride Nicholas Sparks takes you on.  Totally worth it!
B00006RU5B|3.0|Audioslave is a grand band....but i am a HUGE Rage fan  and i nearly killed myself when i found out that they broke up, for now. This Cd is a very good one, but now what i expected totally. In my opinion it is an OK CD. Great guitar work....
B0000640VN|2.0|This was an OK movie. It was not bad by any means, but the film seemed to drag quite a bit and I thought that it could have ended sooner than it did. The storyline was cute, and the actors did a nice job with the film, but overall I guess that I just was not that impressed with the film...sorry!
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido has outdone herself with this album.  She has topped &quot;No Angel&quot;.  I am awaiting her next album.  She has a very soothing voice and her lyrics are very real &amp; meaningful
B00005JLRT|3.0|Remember the Star Trek - Next Generation episode in which the crew discovered, trapped on a remote installation, a &quot;double&quot; of Will Riker?  And this individual actually WAS Will Riker, who eight years previous had been on a mission there, and unknowingly had encountered some sort of ray that split him into two individuals, both the exact same person.  One Riker returned to the Enterprise and continued his career, and the other stayed trapped at the installation.<br />Eight years later, the Enterprise crew discovered him.  Effectively on vacation for eight years, he had not really grown any.  His career was in suspense -- while the other Riker had continued upward, and was now first mate of the Enterprise.  The relationship between Riker #1 and Deanna had cooled, but Riker #2 still cared for her, and proposed to her... but she refused, since her feelings for Will (either of them) had changed in eight years.  Riker #2 departed, and took up his middle name (Thomas) to distinguish himself from Riker #1 (Will).<br />Now, in this final Star Trek movie, Will Riker marries Deanna.   Don't you have to know that Riker #2 Thomas, still out there in the Federation somewhere, had to be majorly hacked off when he heard about that?  Riker #2 was the one whose feelings for Deanna had NOT changed, yet old Riker #1 ended up getting the girl.<br />If there was strife between the two Rikers at family reunions before, one can only imagine (with horror) what things are like now.
B000092Q7O|5.0|Why live in a make believe world when the real world is so much more intriguing?<br />This film tells the story of a pianist who struggled for survival during the Warsaw Getto Uprising in WWII.  I was glued to my seat.  The book from which this film was adapted is more of a journal than a novel.  It was written just after the event, so the memories depicted are fresh.<br />The bonus menu is also strong.  The film peaked my interest to learn more and the bonus specials filled in the missing gaps, complete with shots of the main character in old age and film clips and photos from the Warsaw uprising.<br />This is not a \\"feel good\\" movie.  You won't smile, but you will come away a little richer.
B000001E7T|5.0|My favorite album from my favorite artist. I've been bewitched and bewildered by this woman and this record for a long time now, and hardly know where to begin. Given these circumstances, it calls for me to say something utterly profound I know, but I probably won't. Too much eloquence has already been spoken here, not to mention that I don't perform very well under such pressure. Nonetheless, I will feebly fumble for something insightful to say.<BR> <BR>To those unfamiliar with this album, I want to tell you that this album is a little odd in that some people consider it more accessible than most of her other records, and yet others consider it her most difficult record. <br />Both would be correct.<br />'C'mon Billy', 'Send His Love to Me', are fairly accessible and there are a few other songs that, at least on a surface musical level, can be considered \\"catchy\\" too. Lyrically and vocally however, much of the album is dense and difficult. Not much is easily digested here, but still, it's awfully fun to attempt the chewing!  <br />Even as you may wonder what this woman is carrying-on about, you can't help but be drawn in by her voodoo spell. Your mind reels, hoping to pin down meaning from this record as if you were grasping at a fish with bare hands. You will try in earnest, but this album won't allow you to grasp it completely. It reveals itselfs only on a temporary basis , as if lying still in your hands for a short while before slipping away again, disappearing back into deep, dark and murky recesses.<br />For those who like there music easily digestible, this may not be the best record for you. For those who like a little mystery, a little desperation, something that won't go down nice and easy.. this record may well speak to you.<br />I love the sound of PJs vocals on this record. Raspy, divine, sinister, pleading, disturbed, transcendent. It's as if God has sent his sweetest singing angel and Satan has summoned his most discordant demon to do battle in the form of one female body.<br />There is much more that I could say about this record, but I've already tossed out too many words as it is. Is this a perfect record? Not necessarily, but what it is is perfectly ambitious. It has intrigued me and compelled me for several years now. <br />I only wish I could go back to the first 30 or so times I played this album when it was so intoxicatingly fresh and consuming. But even the memory of that time and the very work itself sustain enough power for me to endorse it to you wholeheartedly.<br />I just hope that I and the other reviewers here haven't set you up for disappointment with all the sycophantic glee we've spewed.<br />Oh, so what. Get your hands on this record anyway. Even if there were to be any initial disappointment, eventually Polly Jean will win you over, sweeping you off your feet and plunging you into her sweetly salted desert swamp.
B00007CVSH|5.0|I love Trovatore and this DVD is very satisfying. Casted by grat star singers who are exellent actors as well. Especially Cura and Hvorostovsky are great Verdi singers. I would like more Verdi opera in DVD by them like Don Carlo.
B000002BMV|3.0|Not being a big fan of Journey (at least since my early teen years.. more on that later), I've been swayed ever so slightly by the passionate pleas of the Journey fans here and will begrudgingly give the boys a little more respect from now on. <br />Yes, I can agree that these are talented musicians and they've made some solid popular songs here. No more, no less. However, that's where my praise must end. 5 star ratings for this, or any Journey album for that matter?? Uhh.. no. <br />I'll liken a band such as Journey to a television program I've seen where a painter paints a picture within the confines of a half-hour show, instructing the viewer along the way as he demonstrates the techniques used to create the scenic painting. The finished product, usually a vase of flowers or some other pleasant scenic picture, is well executed and pleasing to look at. <br />Well crafted.. yes.<BR>Great art?.. hardly.<br />Much like the picture created by this artistic craftsman, Journey doesn't make great art, but they do make pleasant songs that are easy to enjoy, requiring very little effort by the listener. There's very little nuance, complexity of emotion, lyrical or musical originality on display here.. it all goes down pretty easy. The best art should, at least to some degree,  mirror the complexities  and ambivalences of life. Journey is incapable of doing that, and as a result, will never get much respect from critics. <br />While I'll certainly agree that not every song or artist should be aiming for the high heavens of artistic legitimacy, one must at least be capable of making such distinctions. By the level of enthusiastic reviews here, it's evident that most are not. <br />Many reviewers here have found meaning and are genuinely moved by this album, and that's what's great about the power of music in general, no matter what other people may think. Detractors may find the music of Journey too simplistic or unsatisfying in some other way, and find much greater pleasureelsewhere. Journey fans may not be ready to or even capable of recognizing true artistic greatness, and are perfectly contented with what a band like Journey can provide them, never caring enough to dig deeper.<br />When I was in 13 or 14, I bought the Infinity record when it first came out, proud of being in on the ground floor of what I thought was a great band before anybody else knew about them. As the years went by, I explored a lot more, challenging myself to listen to other rock artists that weren't as easily digestible as Journey. I found much greater satisfaction and more meaning elsewhere than I found with Journey and bands of their type. Now, I still retain some nostalgic appreciation for the Styx &amp; REO Speedwagons &amp; Journeys of this world as they provided the soundtrack for my teen years, but understand how much more Rock music is capable of.<br />Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest, go ahead rate my review as unhelpful as I'm sure most of you will. ;-)
B00007CVSH|5.0|This DVD is aimed at visual affect as Hollywood version. I had some problem with Moshinsky's direction who is a Verdi specialist. But all casts were impressively well acted as well as great singing. As Cura and Hvorostovsky were saying during the rehearsals, it's extremely difficult to sing while swashbuckling. This was 1st act's great ending trio. Normally they just stood still to forcused on singing, but this time they made great effort to making it believable connection to 2nd act by Manrico had a chance to kill Count di Luna but hesitated and the Count took advantage to hurt Manrico instead. I have to give 5 stars just for that. Trovatore is a everybody's all time favorite Verdi opera. I'd say the best Manrico was late Franco Corelli and the best Count di Luna was Ettore Bastianini. I don't think any other singers can surpass them but Cura and Hvorostovsky came pretty close. Though their cabaletta(Il balen and Di quella Pira)were cut short. I wouldn't trade Hvorostovsky's Count di Luna for any other but it's hard to believe Leonora mistaking him for Cura's Manrico even in the dark. They don't hardly resemble to be the blood brothers. The time setting is in the middle of 19th Century instead of original medieval time, so the powdered gun was used to execute Manrico. One scene I resented was assault on Azucena in 3rd act. It was disturbing and unnessesary for the great singing of ensemble scene but I still give 5 stars. This is my favorite Trovatore. Extra features of interviews and back ground parts are interesting as well.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Howard Shore is sure making a name for himself with his work on \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.  Shore came from virtual obscurity to become one of the most popular composers today.  \\"The Fellowship\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\" were both stunningly beautiful scores, earning Shore an Oscar.  Yet both scores were rather similar to each other, as if they belonged on a single CD.  <br />Good news to all film score buffs, the \\"Return of the King\\" is quite different than the previous two scores.  Shore creates new themes (and uses some of our old favorites such as \\"The Fellowship\\" theme), a darker tone, uses diverse instruments, and expertly blends delicate vocals from Renee Fleming, Viggo Mortensen, Sir James Galaway, Ben del Maestro, and Billy Boyd into the music.  All of these elements combine flawlessly to make an emotionally powerful and involving symphony on such a grand and epic scale that it literally takes your breath away.  Listening to this music helps you to relive the wondrous film experience and, I warn you, it will bring tears to your eyes!<br />Annie Lennox's \\"Into the West\\" at first seems out of place in a fantasy film, with a guitar strumming in the background.  Fortunately, it actually ends up working beautifully in the film when it plays during the credits.  The lyrics fit the film perfectly; I'm guessing that the song was, indeed, written for the film.<br />Some of my personal favorites on this CD are \\"Hope and Memory\\", \\"The Steward of Gondor\\" (Billy Boyd's vocals are astounding), \\"The Return of the King\\", \\"The Grey Havens\\" and \\"Into the West\\", though all are simply divine!  Unlike most scores nowadays, you can actually listen to the whole CD all the way through without skipping a song because of the high caliber of the music.  <br />Bottom line: the best score of 2003; a phenomenal achievement in cinema music!
B0000TB050|5.0|Awesome sound (DTS), the right songs, amazing sound/ picture quality..... one word WOW!!!! This is by far the best DVD purchase, I have made this year! <br />My ears still hurts ;o) I would highly recommend this one to all of you U2 fans out there, like myself... <br />Cheers.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Even before anyone had heard a single note of The Beatles `Let It Be...Naked', (their revamped, or should that be devamped re-release), it was stirring up a minor storm. Pop historians and Beatle obsessives have been getting their anoraks in a twist over the rights and wrongs of this project. Was it a piece of McCartney revisionism, a cynical money making ploy or just a chance to hear it as originally intended?<br />Enough! Whatever the arguments, `Let It Be...Naked' is here, so what do we get for our money?<br />The songs have been stripped of Phil Spector's sledgehammer production and sickly arrangements to reveal them as they were originally recorded; live by five musicians in 1969, Billy Preston joined the band for these sessions, without overdubs or any production trickery.  These rudimentary recordings have then been digitally cleaned and polished using 2003 technology.<br />The track listing has been re-jigged and we lose two fillers; Maggie Mae and Dig It, and Don't Let Me Down, one of their best b-sides, is added. <BR>But what really strikes you is the freshness of the recordings and the definition between each instrument. This is a CD that is not afraid of space or the odd bit of silence, and it's all the better for it.<br />All of the tracks benefit from being disrobed of Spector's production but deserving of special mentions are Across the Universe and Two of Us, whose acoustic intimacy is greatly enhanced.        <br />So, revisionist? Yes. Money grabbing? Certainly. But is it any good? Definitely.  `Let It Be' was never one of their best albums, and although `Naked' is an improvement, it doesn't change that. What it does do is give you a chance to listen to The Beatles as they really sounded, and you know what? They're not bad, not bad at all.

0784011680|5.0|Charles Chaplin was one of the pioneers in film who brought us classics such as The Kid (1921), Gold Rush (1925), Modern Times (1936), and Great Dictator (1940).  His many successes are still to this day considered masterpieces which he created, acted, directed, and edited.  He had a brilliant eye for what the human mind was observing and he could make comedy out of almost anything.  However, despite Chaplin's great sense of humor the recurrent theme in his life seems to be surrounded by sadness and loss where his escape was to help others feel a sense of joy.  Chaplin is a brilliant cinematic story that has a fantastic cast and where the lead as Chaplin is managed brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr..  In addition, the story weaves in moments out of Chaplin's life where he got his ideas in an ingenious manner which displays the superb directing in the story.  When the audience sees everything put together they will experience a dazzling cinematic experience.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This musical was amazing. THe music was oustanding. I loved it! 5 stars *****!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 is the sequel to X-Men where the strong fear of mutants resurfaces through an attack on the president of the United States by a mutant with extraordinary powers.  This  leads to a public outcry for Mutant Registration and a covert operation by special forces that has been approved by the president against the school for the gifted.  The attack leads to a joint operation between both sides of the mutants, since a dark future seems to lie ahead if the problem is not solved.  As in the predecessor, this film has several subplots that are built up around the general storyline that offers something for all viewers, which generates a terrific cinematic experience.
6304884419|4.0|Casting for this movie was amazing. The plot was amazing. The biker scene was one of the best things i have ever seen in a movie. but then &quot;jane&quot; came into the picture...i dunno her real name because i really don't care...she can't act at all. she sounded like she was reading right off the script. Colugero and Jane's &quot;Romance&quot; seemed forced. Other then that...this is one of the best movies i have ever seen
B00000K19E|4.0|Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), alias Neo, is a computer programmer by day and a hacker by night who is not getting much sleep due to troubled thoughts.  One evening Neo receives a message on his computer and later a strange phone call from a different hacker who goes by the name Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  This is the beginning of a complete turmoil related to Neo's existence and he is thrown into an adventure unlike no other ever created, no pun intended.  Matrix is a clever science fiction story that triggers reflection in regards to our existence and values, which can be experienced through fast paced action packed entertainment.
B00004TL21|5.0|Anyone who judges books/CDs by their covers will find their method seriously lacking when they pick up White Pony.  For Deftones' masterpiece is neither monochromatic nor stark and simple, though the cover is beautiful for just these reasons.  Musically, Deftones have reached the ground that only the greats can reach: Tool may own the promised land, but Deftones have every right to rent from them.<br />I can't even pick out a high spot; everything is so good that it defies description, and while Deftones don't write perfect endings to their songs (a la Tool's &quot;Lateralis&quot;), they get all other parts down solid.  Though many point to &quot;Passenger&quot; as the highlight of the album, I disagree; I suggest &quot;Change&quot; and &quot;pink maggit&quot; at the end would be my nomination for their best work, but there are times when I prefer &quot;Digital Bath&quot; instead.<br />The key to realizing what's going on here is to understand that this is a phenomenal album because it combines the most important elements of any great rock album: superb songwriting, fantastic performance, and excellent production.  Amorphous a concept as millenia are, this may be the first great album of the 2000 era.  A necessary collection that both nu-metallers and old-school metallers alike will revere.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|In Matrix Reloaded the struggle for mankind continues where Neo (Keanu Reeves) has been elevated to a more divine position by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his followers.  This time they are short on time, since they only have 72 hours until a massive number of probes will reach the underground city of Zion.  Before this Neo must get into the Matrix where some strange occurrences have been observed by the crew on the Nebuchadnezzar, the hovercraft, which leads to some visually stunning scenes.  In the Matrix Neo seeks out the Oracle in order to find some answers to some questions that they have; however, the answers lead to further questions which turn into a maze of problems.  Matrix Reloaded uses some amazing special effects that cost a fortune to produce, however, the beginning of the film has some troubling transitions and scenes that causes awkwardness in the storyline.  These clumsy cinematic moments are temporarily saved by the special effects, but in the long run the film suffers from a cinematically congested introduction that is full of inelegant transitions between scenes and characters. In the end, the audience is presented with a story that offers some valuable lessons and quick paced entertainment, but it does not measure up with the forerunning story.

B0000C7PSW|4.0|I am as big a Rufus fan as anyone else reviewing this album, but I have to admit that I am slightly disappointed with his third solo effort.  Really I would have given it three and a half stars...because it's Rufus I rounded up.<br />This album still has the lush melodies, interesting harmonies, etc. that I prized in his two previous albums.  But although excess is one of the reasons I enjoy listening to Rufus so much, I think he chose it as a defining part of his musicianship, and allowed that decision to overtake the tongue-in-cheek subtlety of Rufus Wainwright and Poses.  Want One is almost overindulgent, like a really rich cheesecake with a cup of fudge poured over the top.  I was also disappointed in it lyrically.  Please....my phone's on vibrate?  Dancing to Britney Spears?  Dated and a bit trite.  Maybe it's my loathing for the latter &quot;singer&quot; that leads me to this conclusion, but I can't help feeling that it lacks the poetry of his other albums.<br />But even with all this...I give it four stars.  Why??  Simply because Rufus Wainwright can almost do no wrong in my eyes.  His voice kicks the derrieres of 98% of all rock and pop voices out there (only the like of Jeff Buckley and the late Freddy Mercury topping him).  And MOST of the songs on the albums are still very very good.  Not great or brilliant perhaps...but very very good.<br />If you're a fan, go ahead and buy it.  If you're not, I suggest getting the other two first to see if you'll become one.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is a very good edition for a collector. The extended scenes in the movie are over 32 minutes plus 12 minutes of fan club cridets. The additional scenes are very informative and makes it like watching a whole new movie.<br />It's a must have in every collection
B000005RTR|5.0|I bought this album with very little by way of expectations. A live Whitesnake album without &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; on it? Is this a misprint?<br />I know all about Mr. Coverdale's history, both with Deep Purple and beyond. I had no idea this live album was recorded before they enjoyed the huge success they did in the mid 80's. But, I do want to make a remark here.<br />Producing a song that people like is not &quot;selling out.&quot; I'm getting really tired of hearing such a blanket statement. Selling out is going from being a hard rock band to being a pathetic pop band and changing the songs you already wrote to fit your pop turn, see Bon Jovi in 2003. But, the idea that a good rock album is only a real album if it's an import is pathetic. Some bands, like Whitesnake, received air play because they made good music that people wanted to hear and could relate to. So, put that &quot;sell out&quot; line away because it does not apply to Whitesnake.<br />This is a good album even without material that the mainstream wasn't fortunate enough to know. I love David Coverdale's voice, though. It had that blues sound that all real rockers love and the party sound for live concert. Basically, you feel the emotion in every note. That's why I surround myself in Mr. Coverdale's music. He's a rock God.<br />Whitesnake music runs through my veins. I'm 22 years old. This album was recorded before I was born. Tell me something, does this prove to you that true rock and roll, when performed right, can stand the test of time? I think so. So, take my word for it and check it out. You'll be glad you did!

0064407667|5.0|Ever read a children's book that combines humor, unfortunate events, an elusive author, and an interesting plot all in one? Unless you've read the A Series Of Unfortunate Events books, I doubt you can say that. These books chronicle the lives of three smart and clever orphans who must deal with bad, strange situations in each story. And it all starts off with just one fire...<br />Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire were taking a walk on the beach one day, little knowing that soon, their life would be taking a drastic change. The three Baudelaire children were comfortably growing up in a large mansion. Sunny, the youngest, loved to bite things, Klaus loved to read books, and Violet was one of the best inventors around. On that fateful day, Mr. Poe, a banker and friend of the Baudelaires, approached them and told them that their parents had died in a fire that had destroyed their entire house and had killed their parents. Mr. Poe informed them that they would be staying with a relative named Count Olaf, who lived not too far away. Sunny, Klaus, and Violet immediately know upon arrival at Count Olaf's house that he was no ordinary man. First of all, his house was full of paintings of eyes that seemed to be staring straight back at you. Second, he was an actor and had a whole theater troupe full of strange actors, including a man with hooks for hands, two women that had completely white faces, and other strange characters. Third, Count Olaf's house was filthy and disgusting. Violet, Sunny, and Klaus were given one small room with filthy curtains, a lumpy bed, a cardboard box to use as a closet, a pile of rocks to play with instead of toys, and of course, a painting of an eye. Count Olaf made each child do chores every day, such as making dinner for his troupe or cutting up firewood for no apparent reason in the yard. A couple days after the three children arrive, Count Olaf announces that he will be doing a play in which Violet, Sunny, and Klaus would have parts in. Inthe play, titled \\"The Marvelous Marriage,\\" Violet would be the bride, Count Olaf would be the husband, and Sunny and Klaus would be two of the people invited to the wedding ceremony. Justice Strauss, Count Olaf's neighbor, would be the judge. The three children suspected that this play might be part of a plan, so Klaus and Violet borrowed some books about marriage and law from Justice Strauss' library. Klaus finally discovers that Count Olaf's play was all a plan to get the Baudelaire fortune by marrying her using an official document from City Hall, being in front of a judge (Justice Strauss), and having witnesses. Since Count Olaf was Violet's legal guardian, he had permission to allow her to marry, and once a husband had married his wife, all her money would be in Count Olaf's control. Violet, Sunny, and Klaus would have to find a way to stop Count Olaf from ruining their lives forever. The book ends at sort of a cliffhanger; so read the next book \\"The Reptile Room\\" to find out what's next in the Baudelaire's woeful lives.
0195067142|5.0|That Mr. Sledge's book is a classic, among the best of war memoires, is widely acknowledged. It is about time it also was fully admitted into the canon of American literature. This book should be mandatory reading in college level American lit surveys. Mr. Sledge is an unpretentious storyteller, but an utterly masterful one. He has a consistent eye for the perfect detail. And it is not just the horror and the pity that grabs you, but the moral and intellectual honesty, above all the decency of spirit that informs his desperate attempt to make sense of his experience.<br />The book nicely divides itself into two parts: the first, Peleliu, deals with the narrator's experience of fear and confusion; the second, Okinawa, deals with his revulsion and disgust, the first part takes place on burning hot coral, the second in cold mud. But the whole book is characterized, more than anything, by a Mr. Sledge's love: for life, his fellows, for a special commander, and for his corps and country. You want authenticity? Real authenticity, not the fake &quot;authentiticy&quot; served up by so much of the literature of confessionalism? Read Mr. Sledge.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of this show even though I have been known to watch Angel and Buffy on occasion. I actually heard about this from an friend who was visiting from Australia. I purchased it and was stunned at the rich character portrayals. How sad to find out that such an enjoyable show was so quickly canceled. I think that this will be a surprise to anyone who enjoys the science fiction television.
B000005JA8|5.0|So, we've established that 'Trout Mask Replica' is a &quot;difficult&quot; record.  There's nothing here that a fan of conventional pop music will recognize as pretty, engaging, compelling, etc.  For clarification, let me add that the definition of pop music I'm working from includes pretty much anything recorded since the mid-50's that isn't in the European Classical or jazz traditions.  Using that definition, I think it's fair to lump, say, Pink Floyd alongside, say, Celine Dion as &quot;conventional pop music&quot; -- and by that I only me that, in the braodest possible sense, Floyd and Celine sound similar.  I'm not trying to make any statements about the artistic merits of either (or slight Floyd) with this comparison; the point is, both have fairly similar ideas about things like melody, meter, and dynamics.  Enlarge the field a little: Floyd and Celine Dion share some fundamental conceptions about what music should sound like with pretty much every other recording artist you've ever heard of, Captain Beefheart included.  It's just that Beefheart is a little less interested in accepted definitions of &quot;good&quot; pop music than some other folks.<br />In other words, 'Trout Mask Replica' is, in part, weird for the sake of being weird -- so what?  So was 'Sgt. Pepper,' so was 'Blonde on Blonde.'  Those albums both defied the understood limits of what you could do in pop music.  Innovation begins when people seek out and wilfully violate established standards of decency, although real innovation demands more than just defiance.  Anybody can be weird: listen to the Godz, the Fugs, the Silver Apples, and you'll hear what weridness sounded like when the Magic Band was recording 'Trout Mask Replica.'  Those guys were all &quot;out there&quot; when being out there was in.  By and large, those other bands suck.  They're fun to listen to a couple times, but once the novelty wears off they cease to be interesting.  'Trout Mask Replica' stands apart because it's not *just* some freaked-out counterculture-type's cracked version of pop music (I mean, it *is* a freaky hippy version of pop music, but there's more to it than that).<br />'Trout Mask Replica' isn't as overtly bluesy as earlier Beefheart recordings (and those records are definitely bluesy -- remember Ry Cooder was in this band), but thinking of Beefheart as a blues singer sheds some light on things.  Thinking of Beefheart as a psychidelic comic book version of a blues singer helps even more.  I listen to the good Captain's singing like I listen to an Albert Ayler record: what's important is tone and timbre, not melody.  Plain and simple, the guy's just having fun with his voice.  If you start to wish you weren't too uptight to enjoy a good howl, it's working.  Once you can deal with the voice, the rest of the band isn't so hard to deal with.  Langdon Winner described the songs on 'Trout Mask Replica' as being like delicate dune buggies driven way too fast by blind men, or something like that.  They stop and they start and they heave and they definitely don't get down and boogie, but there's a unifying ethic in there somewhere.  I can't hear it every time I listen to this record.  But on those occasions when I can find it, it's immensely rewarding, like hearing the whole history of blues and pop and jazz turned inside out and filtered through an R. Crumb comic.<br />So, I hope this helps anybody who's listening to 'Trout Mask Replica' and trying vainly to find something recognizeable to grab on to.  If the record leaves you shocked and dismayed, keep listening -- you're halfway there.

078401213X|3.0|The Untied States has a long and probably singular contempt for intellectual pursuit, stemming mostly from its Puritan roots.  In fact, this film could easily have been premised on the biblical verse: &quot;Of the making of many books there is no end and much study is weariness to the flesh.&quot;<br />The film concerns a mathematician's (Max Cohen's) quest to find an underlying structure to all reality that can be expressed mathematically.  Of course, his quest is cast as an obsession that makes him somewhat antisocial and gives him extreme debilitating migraines that he attempts to palliate through various drugs.  He hopes to discover this underlying mathematical structure for noble purposes like predicting outcomes in the stock market.  In the Puritan worldview, people given to intellectual pursuits cannot be motivated by worthwhile concerns.  His pursuit comes to the attention of corporate gangsters and Jewish mystics.  The former want to use his formula to plot their investments, while the latter want it in order to find the mathematical expression that can be translated into the (lost) secret name of God.  Both groups strong-arm Max, indicating that there is no real spiritual difference between them.  I found the parallel of greed with Jews disturbing.<br />In the end, Max lobotomizes himself by drilling a hole in his head.  He can no longer do relatively simple computations and has all the docile pleasantness of Forrest Gump, the American ideal.  Ignorance is bliss.  The entire movie turns on this clich&eacute;.<br />Ironically, the choice of black and white was appropriate for the film.  It parallels nicely the false dilemma the film presents: either we live with a tortured dysfunctional intelligence or a tranquil ignorance.  The acting was superb and the special effects were quite good for a low-budget film.  The film is worth seeing, but it really says nothing we haven't heard many times before.

B0000C9ZLD|2.0|I TRIED to like this band, really.  The rock critics kept telling me how great they were, so I bought the first album and found it pleasant enough, but spent little time in my CD player.  Then the follow-up and more hysterical orgasmic moans from the music press, so I caved in and discovered... ROOM ON FIRE.  Yawn.  Another reviewer mentioned the vocal distortion device, which left me wondering, &quot;can this guy really sing?&quot;  The band sounds mechanical and devoid of passion.  The best word I can use is &quot;underwhelming&quot;... not really bad, just competent.  Do not buy this album... if you want to steal or burn a copy, it might function okay as background music, but don't believe the hype.  This band will not be remembered in ten years, except as a footnote.
B00009TB5G|5.0|For those of you who didn't get the whole bit about Aragorn and the blonde girl, you need to watch this film.  For those who were so bloody angry about the Elves going to Helm's Deep and not the Trees, well, then this is for you, too.  And it's even for those ardent Tom Bobadil fans who just need the writers to throw them a bone.  This film is just better and it is the film that Peter Jackson would rather put his name on...it's his film.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll understand a lot more, especially when you get set to watch The Return of the King.<BR>One piece of advice, though...if you haven't seen the Extended Edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, you need to pick that one up first.  The two EE's really flow together well.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii is one of the greatest concert films of all time, perhaps even the single best live performance ever put to film.  While I could appreciate the director's intent with this new version, his creative vision has past its prime and we're left with a rather uninspired spinoff of the original.<br />The director's cut features a few extra bits of footage thrown in, but they don't add anything special to the film.  What disappoints me is not so much that this footage was included, as it is used to &quot;cover&quot; bits of the original the director wasn't totally proud of.  For example, one of my favorite sequences in the original is the arrival and setup of all the equipment in the ampitheater.  That's been replaced by shots of cheap computer animations of planets with rough, geometric edges, obviously digital and saturated colors seeming to drift through space much too quickly.  Other additions include stock footage of the Saturn V rocket launch and the first moon landing.<br />I find it hard not to enjoy the film anyway, but that's strictly because of the music.  Fortunately, none of the music itself has been altered and the original cut of the concert footage is included as special feature, so I don't feel like I've been ripped off.  The other extras on the disc are satisfying, but not entirely up to the standard of quality I've come to expect from Pink Floyd releases.<br />If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, I'd highly recommend checking this out if you haven't already in spite of the changes.  If you're a purist though, you may be a little bit disappointed.
0783239955|3.0|I agree: there are some good laughs in this film, especially as it warms up after the first half hour. That said, it left me with a quibble and with a slight off taste. <br />First, the quibble -- unlikely to have bothered most people. The premise is that the snobs invite an idiot to dinner each week, but the film has a bit of an odd notion of where to look for idiots. Why does Pignon get picked? Because he has an obsession -- just like the boomerang man in one of the opening scenes. In Pignon's case, the obsession is making meticulous scale models of bridges, buildings, the Eiffel Tower... out of matchsticks. But weird hobbies and peculiar obsessions aren't the same as stupidity.<br />As it turns out, Pignon doesn't disappoint. Not only is he obsessed; he's also clueless. But that's where the off taste comes in. We don't have any sympathy for Pierre, the snob who invites Pignon to his house, but nonetheless, the movie puts the audience in the place of the would-have-been dinner guests: we get our laughs as much at Pignon's expense as from looking down on his host. There's one brief moment of humanity at the very end, but the screenplay immediately takes it back. <br />The reply, I suppose, is that it's a comedy, for heaven's sake! True enough; we aren't watching it to be edified. But the film would be cleverer if the audience got its own come-uppance.

0312995423|1.0|A sad example of an author who has achieved success with a later work (Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons) succumbing to his agent's plea to dig through his rejected stuff for anything remotely marketable on the tail of his or her new found reputation. Yes there are early works that were rejected through bad timing or some arbitrary glitch and whose publication is a positive contribution to an author's body of work; Digital Fortress is not one of those. Those editors that rejected this rough draft in the nineties (note the1998 copyright date) were right that Digital fortress did not deserve to see the light of day: too light, too clichéd, just way too first draft. Dan; you really shouldn't have listened to your greedy agent (apologies for the redundancy).<br />As I suspect was the plot, I bought this title on the strengths of his later published titles, especially Angels and Demons, please do not make the same mistake. If you simply must read everything a favored author publishes buy this one used or as a remainder as it is merely a very good example of the fact people can vastly improve writing over time (or more vigorous editing).  For those who do bother I'd suggest treating it like those early studio tracks we get on a CD boxed set: simply appreciate how far the artist has come!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|firstly, it is a good cd. it has a great intro; urban beat piano etc....karma, heartburn and if i was your woman are all really great songs...i really like heartburn's beats in the background.

FAVE SONG: &quot;If I Aint' Got You&quot; This is a really beautiful song...so to speak. It is really a great song and has good piano Then there is diary another good song which leads the biggest dud i have heard yet. I HATE Dragon Days. It is just so wierd... I mean the tune is great the message dunno but the lyrics are just wierd and i dunno about the symbolism..if it is sumbolism. But so simple, wake up, slow down and samsonite man are all really good. The interlude has a jazzy feel; fun. But sorta wierd how she says &quot;Myabe I'm invisibile&quot; lol is she? <BR>In general this is CD is really good with one unbearable song..the dud..haha..maybe others like it..but i don't..If you don't think it is a good CD look at the sales. in 4 weeks it sold i think 1.7 million..i think dunno..but it's good
6303407188|5.0|There was a time when I regarded Johnny Depp as being basically another young pretty-boy actor, and let's face it --- there was a time when he was marketed as being exactly that.  When an actor is marketed on the basis of his good looks, rather than his talent, it becomes hard to take him seriously at his craft.<br />Then Johnny Depp appeared in this bizarre hommage to naive optimism abd true committment to one's craft.  As Ed Wood, Depp touchingly portrays a man who is amazingly unaware of his own breath-taking incompetence.  One is left with the image of a man who had the heart &amp; soul of an artist, albeit an artist with no corresponding talent whatsoever.<br />One would think you should be feeling sorry for Ed Wood, because he really really sucked at what he loved doing most, but if this portrayal is to be believed, he was so committed to his craft that he spent little time feeling sorry for himself.  Strangely enough, that strikes me as being truly heroic &amp; admirable.<br />I had never seen Depp play a role such as this before, and it gave me a new respect for the man's talents as an actor.  He has played some off-the-wall characters since that time, and one cannot help but see a hint of Ed Wood in Depp's rather unconventional turn as Captain Jack Sparrow in last year's &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean.&quot;  But unlike the pirate flick, this movie leaves feeling truly touched and moved by the subject matter.  Truly this is not a movie to be missed.
0062512919|2.0|There are two reasons why I chose this book to read.  Reason number one is because Paulo Coelho wrote it, and I became a fan of his work when I read &quot;The Alchemist.&quot;  The second reason is because I first heard of the Valkyries on a televison show.  I had hoped to sit down to a reading of immense enjoyment.  I was disappointed.<br />I believe in order to fully understand and enjoy &quot;The Valkyries&quot;, you must be on a different level of spiritual enlightment and be open to strange expressions of faith and of hope and of love.  Paulo writes of his experiences in the Mojave Desert searching for his angel through first a young man and then leather wearing, biker running women.  Will you find love, faith, and hope with these types of elements?  I have no idea.  For each person, I suppose it is different.<br />For me this novel left unexplainable ideals.  I wanted more of a description of the channeling, the rituals.  What were they feeling?  Describe what the second mind is in more detail.  Is it the conscious, is it deeper, did I miss the description all together?  I didn't find it fullfilling, and I was extremely disappointed.<br />I will add this, the &quot;The Valkyries&quot; is a true story according to Paulo Coelho.  He admits to adding two fictional details in his accounts, but overall it is a true story.  If you like to read about soul searching journies, this will do it.<br />Joy.
0446310786|1.0|Well if this is a classic then so could the Charlies Angel's movies.  All the book consists of is a middle-class family in the south with a few weird neighbors.  I mean come on. Who really cares about a little girl that goes around the neighborhood doing things like spying on her albino neighbor.  If that makes a book a classic, shame on you.  Atticus against all odds is always fair and never makes anyone mad.  He deals with all disputes perfectly.  A wee bit too good to be true.  Don't you think?  Finishing this book felt like the equivalent of fighting in World War II with nothing but an army of G.I. Joes.  If you have been given this book as a present I give you my deepest condolences.

B000099T2L|1.0|I liked her radio hit 'Crazy In Love' enough to try out the album. It turned out to be the only track worth listening to more than once, but be warned that the version of 'Crazy In Love' on this album is ruined by some guy (Jay Z) trying to rap in the background. I would recommend trying out a few of her other tunes before spending your money on this album, and if you only want it for 'Crazy In Love' you're better off going with the single.
B00005JLR6|5.0|IN AMERICA has heart, extraordinary writing, superb acting, admirable cinematography by Declan Quinn, and, in short, everything that \\"small films\\" attempt for, in abundance.  Based on autobiographical material this screenplay was written by Jim Sheridan (who also directs with great sensitivity) and his two daughters.  The story is that of an Irish family - a man and wife and thier two daughters - who swallow their recent loss of their only son and emigrate from Canada to America.  The story is related through the tender eyes of the older daughter, who in the manner Irish holds three wishes bestowed by her brother's death.  How she uses those wishes in the Americanization of the Sullivan family forms the story line.  Against all the odds that so often impale immigrants to this country - inability to find decent housing, work, friends etc - this warm family's plight is magnified by the fact that they must learn to exist in a sleazy tenement building.  Father is a wannabe actor who ends up driving a cab at night, the girls struggle with the new way of language and living, and the mother longs for another pregnancy to help fill the void of her lost child.  They are befriended (mutually) by an African artist who lives below them and who eventually becomes a significant part of their extended family.  To tell more would be unfair, as it is the tragedy and how it turns that makes the movie glow.<br />Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine as the parents are as fine as actors can get. The daughters are played with impeccable grace and skill by Sarah and Emma Bolger, and Mateo (their new fried) is the creation of the beautiful actor Djimon Hounsou who shines in this pivotal role.  This story is related with underplayed sensitivity and heartwarming tenderness.  Rarely has a film found an audience that is almost uniformly moved to quiet tears during the credits.  Would that there could be more honest, thoughtful, touching films like IN AMERICA to tend to the bruised psyches of us all.  Kudos to Jim Sheridan and his enormously gifted cast and crew - and to his courage to pursue this project.all.

B0000AMRJC|4.0|The 20th Anniversary release of SCARFACE reminds us that our movies of today that deal with violence have not grown more intense than the older films like THE GODFATHER for Italian organized crime and SCARFACE for Cuban/Colombian organized crime.  It is difficult to watch this well made movie because of its ultravivid bloodshed, but once past this obstacle there are reasons to revisit Brian DePalma's interpretation of Oliver Stone's screenplay.  Al Pacino gives a mighty performance as the title character, managing for most of the film to maintain a Cuban accent adequately.  His comrade Manolo is well acted by Steven Bauer, and F. Murray Abraham and Robert Loggia are terrific.  It is a joy to see Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastranotonio is such daring roles (they are both even more beautiful and more talented now).  If grit and exploitation of the underworld are your cup of tea, then look no further.  The new &quot;additives&quot; seem just that - added, but not contributory.

In addition to the story line presented in this part two of LOTR it displays true courage and friendship among various people which is seldom seen in any film these days.  In this version of \\"The Two Towers\\" Frodo and Sam are separated from the rest of the Fellowship.  They continue their journey to Mordor in the hopes of destroying the ring with the guidance of Gollum a former Hobbit.  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli continue their search of Pippin and Merry who were taken by the Orcs.  To the surprise of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli Gandalf returns to help them in the preparation of a battle with the people of Rohan against the Orcs at Helms Deep a fortress in the mountains.  The battle scene is one of the best ever made.  The special effects in creating Gollum are unsurpassed.

Those who felt that Daredevil was not enough like Spiderman are right, but I prefer it when Daredevil is much more than just a clone of Spidey. Stan Lee may have made Daredevil very similar to Spiderman when the character was introduced, but as the years have passed various writers have made DD his own man.<BR>  Daredevil's origin has been altered in the film so that things are not as simple or clear cut as in the original Lee origin. Some complain that since Matt doesn't become blinded while saving somebody it reduces him as a hero, but Spiderman getting bit by a spider isn't a heroic act and there are so many other examples where super hero's gain their powers and then evolve into the hero they become and Daredevil is all about evolution. One evolving character is Jack Murdock who is a much more complicated character in the film and reflects the more complex nature of characters from the last two decades of the Daredevil comics. The irony of Matt saving a blind man only to become blind has been replaced with the more moving irony of Jack becoming a better man after his behavior played a role in Matt becoming blind and being killed because of his rediscovered morality. I thought that was a nice touch which echoed throughout the film as DD struggled with his own morality and the choices he made.<BR>  The number of elements in the film directly inspired from the comic are astounding although it seems it was a struggle to use the DD suit in the movie and I applaud the director and those who fought for a suit that was very close to the one in the comic. Also Bullseye's appearance is different from the comic, but then so is Wolverine's costume in the X-Men films and I personally think Bullseye's look in the film is great and he's been portrayed that way in the comic book lately. One reviewer on here is unhappy that the Kingpin is African American in the film, but where in the comic does it say he belongs to the Mafia and has to be white? I'll never forget complaints about Mystique looking different in X-Men so you can't please everybody.<BR>If you are not a stickler for minute details these changes will not interfere with your enjoyment of the film and similar differences can be found in the X-Men or Spiderman films from their comic roots. It's not easy distilling decades of a comic book story into a feature film, but Daredevil does a great job. It makes Daredevil a more complex character than Lee first presented, but he's grown and changed a lot over the years and the film tries to convey that to an audience who may not be familiar with the comic while staying true to an astounding number of elements from it's source of inspiration and obviously being made by a fan of the comics for other Daredevil fans.
B00005JME0|5.0|I saw a screening of this movie and as much as I expected to be non-plussed at best, it was amazing.  Like a cross between Memento and a dark It's A Wonderful Life, the movie plays with time, reality, and the greatest \\"What if?\\" that there's ever been.<br />Ashton Kutcher plays Evan, a college student who can relive gnarly past events and in doing so, change the present.  The outcome is always a surprising set of consequences.  I don't want to say too much about the movie because I sincerely believe this is one of those few movies where you shouldn't know too much.  While a number of movies have played with time travel (Terminator, Back to the Future, Etc...) this one does it with a gritty slickness that is truly different and very unpredictable.  <br />People will definately be surprised at Kutcher's performance and this movie is an inarguable breakthrough for him as a dramatic actor.  Amy Smart shows her dramatic chops as well, after doing comedic roles in Rat Race and Road Trip.  It's kind of a dream role, in that she gets to play four characters in one movie, each one multi-dimensional and vastly diverse from the previous ones.  I read that Eldon Henson, dropped and gained 30 pounds for his various roles as well.  I think it demonstrates the dedication that the actors put into the project and it certainly pays off on screen.<br />It's an incredibly thought provoking concept with all these cool set ups and payoffs along the way.  I was surprised by how violent it was at times, but it worked for the story and I'm not turned off by that kinda thing.  By far one of the best movies I've seen this year and deserves some sort of critical acclaim even though it comes out at a time of year when movies are for the most part forgotten. <br />See this movie and you'll get your money's worth.  I'm probably going to have to see it again because, like films like The Sixth Sense, it should be even cooler the second time around when you know the secrets.
0375432302|3.0|It captured my interest from the first pages.  Fast paced. Some of the problem solving was a bit too convenient.<br />Readers need to realize that not only are his characters and story fictional, but also the \\"facts\\" that his characters provide.  The distortions are rampant, and the selective history lessons are misguided at best.  The uneducated and uninitiated reader can come away with a seriously damaged understanding of the early church.  I suggest readers who are really interested in the history of Jesus and the early churn see John Meier's excellent series entitled \\"The Marginal Jew\\".  Those who are interested in how loosely Dan Brown plays with the truth will want to visit: [...]<br />If you like good fiction it's fun.  If you like good history it's the wrong place to look!
B00005R87Q|4.0|One man carries this film, Vin Diesel. Take a bow sir, you are a scholar and a gentleman.
0064407667|1.0|I cannot believe this book was recommended to people who liked Harry Potter!  It's an outrage.  The writing is terrible and condescending.  The plot is juvenile and, well, stupid.  I gave it only one star because I didn't have the option to give a negative number to counter the 4 star rating displayed on this web-site.  I would discourage any one from reading such garbage.  What a waste.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|This film seriously lacks the prescence of Vin Diesel. It gets by without him, but most of the coolness that was Fast and Furious is gone. Paul Walker can't carry the film, and Tyrese is a substandard Diesel replacement, he's okay is his part, gets a few laughs, but he's got nowhere near the presence, nor the wry smile.<br />The plot, well it's just a silly drug runners and cops story that becomes ridiculous by the end, heck even Tyrese said as much in the outtakes.<br />The cars - They suck, I'm sorry but the Supra in no.1 kicked [rear] over the big Mitsubishi product placement that is 2Fast 2Furious... I mean the Lancer EVO 7??? hardly gets the blood running, it looks like a compact family car.<br />The girls - There is a well freaky looking chick in this film that drives the Honda S2000, sigh, where is Michel Rodrigues, she was kewl (and a great match of Vin).<br />Anyway, it's still ok, but they should have just paid Vin whatever he wanted, it would have been a better film for it.
B0000959N0|4.0|I've sat through poorly made comic book movies and from the negative reviews of this one I expected it to miss the mark the same way the Captain America movie did, but Daredevil is surprisingly on target. This one got slammed hard because it's not Spider-man, and people are sick of Affleck after being force fed JLO and Ben on every channel and magazine cover, but this is a great comic movie and it surprised me how much it captured the spirit of the comic book. It may not be cool to admit it, but Affleck is a fan of the comic and his understanding of the character shows. If you think he's cardboard in this one you need to watch it again. He captured both the lawyer side and the vigilante side of the character very well. Who else in the current Hollywood scene fits the character? He's quite good here and the rest of the cast are excellent too. There are so many moments in this one that are clearly inspired by the comic and the director's vision is also that of a fan of the comic. When all is said and done, Daredevil isn't Spider-man and it stars Ben Affleck and it may not be 'cool' to admit you like it, but this is a damn good comic book movie.
B00005JL78|2.0|What has happened to Steven Spielberg? Ever since he 'went serious' he's produced pretentious, bloated and strangely vapid films like this. The plot is ridiculous. There is a simply horrid scene with a Russian doctor and nurse with a giant mole... I mean c'mon why focus on the giant mole? Is this what watching too much Kubrick does to otherwise competent directors??? To think this guy once made Indiana Jones.<br />Spielberg is a one-dimensional and not particularly artistic director, he should not endeavour to make 'edgier' films because the result is stuff like this, neither edgy nor entertaining, just self-involved, overlong and ultimately, boring, which cinematically speaking, is just about the worst crime you could commit.
B00008DDXB|2.0|Acting and set improved since Sorcerer's Stone where the real petrification occurred.<br />Cast for Chambers:<BR>Myrtle, Ron, Snape, Vernon - know how to act.<BR>Brannagh - real acting.<BR>Tom - \\"I'll show you acting, Potter!\\"<BR>Dumbledore - Zzzzz.  <BR>Fake snake - fake.<BR>Fawkes - fake savior against fake snake.<BR>Ginny & Potter - weird Oedipal resemblance to Lily and James.<br />As usual, suspending belief is essential to understanding the story.  Adults have no sense and only the Potter gangsters can bring salvation.  So why isn't Professor McGonagall taking lessons from Potter?  In a world where snooping is heroism, the tale of two misfits continues, either Harry or Tom will crack, for neither can live while the other fails at acting.
B00006LJ72|4.0|The collection speaks for itself!  The debatable thing about this is &quot;Does Enya Deserve Box Set Treatment?&quot;.  She made her United States debut 17 years ago with her &quot;The Celts&quot; album!  Is that long enough?  Maybe 17 years from now, there will be a SECOND Box Set to supplement this!
1400031362|4.0|Mma Precious Ramotswe, the only lady private investigator in the nation of Botswana, finds that being engaged isn't all it's cracked up to be in this third installment in Smith's series (you definitely need to have read the first two in order to understand the references).  Her fiance, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, the heretofore devoted and successful owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and foster father to two Bushman orphans, proves to be suffering from depression and must be subtly tricked into seeking medical help.  Meanwhile, her assistant, Mma Makutsi, discovers unsuspected talents when they move the Agency offices to share the garage premises and she finds herself riding herd on Mr. Matekoni's notoriously lazy and inept apprentices.  Mystery is provided by the possible ongoing poisoning of the brother of an important Government official, who suspects his sister-in-law, and the discovery in the bush of a naked boy who &quot;smells of lions&quot; (anyone who has read Kipling's Mowgli stories will immediately guess at his past, though nothing canonical is established about it).  The title arises from Mma Makutsi's efforts to learn which (if any) of four finalists in the Miss Glamorous Botswana contest are morally suited to the title.  Smith, as always, conveys much of the spirit, flavor, and customs of the African nation he knows so well, and leaves us wanting to know how the cases of Mr. Maketoni's depression and the mysterious bush boy will turn out.  Highly recommended for readers of the series.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden has really out done themselves with Dance of Death (DoD).  I have every Maiden CD out there, including their live CD's.  DoD will end up ranking high with all their loyal fans.  Their musical talent continues to expand and is capable of taking you to a whole other realm.  The music is not only soothing, with a hint of classical undertones, but rocks with the best of them.  People will say, they hit their marker with Seventh Son of the Seventh Son, but I will argue DoD has reached further musically.  <br />For a song by song list... here you go...<BR>1. Wildest Dreams 6/10 - the weakest song on the album, its still good, but not a true Maiden classic.<BR>2. Rainmaker 8/10 - at first I was not real sure, but it has continued to grow on me and is becoming one of my favorites. <BR>3. No More Lies 10/10 - true classic, the lyrics combinded with the over all musical qualitity is definitve Maiden at their best. <BR>4. Montsigur 8/10 - maybe its because its between No More Lies and DoD, this song gets over looked, but you will definately enjoy. <BR>5. Dance of Death 10/10 - another classic and my favorite by far, song as a story you actually can follow along in your head and see the whole picture.  A truly amazing work of art. <BR>6. Gates of Tomorrow 7/10 - A good song, but will be one of those that you will not hear about in the future from fans.  Kinda like To Tame A Land off the Powerslave CD.  Good song, not rememberable.<BR>7. New Frontier 8/10 - powerful song that just sucks you in <BR>8. Paschendale 9/10 - the only reason it is not a 10 is because I think it actually could be a little better, don't get me wrong, I love this song, but there are a couple of points where I think a slight change would have made it a classic <BR>9. Face in the Sand  10/10 - One fans may not speak much about as Dod or No More Lies will hog all the talk, but this song simply rocks and is a definate classic with the Iron Maiden sound<BR>10. Age of Innocence 9/10 - another greatsong which gets you prepared for the Journeyman. <BR>11. Journeyman 10/10 - the lyrics are amazing in this song as is the musical notes.  A very heart touching melody that grips at you and forces you to sing a long.  About at close to a ballad you will ever get with Maiden, but still gets to the core of traditional Heavy Metal.<br />Like I said, if your a Maiden fan, you must get this CD, it is one of their best and they have had so many.  I can't wait for the next CD.  MAIDEN IS BACK!!!
B0000033TE|5.0|Karn Evil 9 1st Impression is restored on this remastered CD: there is no longer the break between the 1st and 2nd half (which was where the record had to be turned over).  The song still spans two tracks, but without a fade-down and fade-up.<br />There are a decent amount of liner notes, a bonus interview at the end of the disc which is nice, and a cool holographic cover which hopefully is still being used.<br />&quot;Still.... You Turn Me On&quot; remains the only love song I know of about a corpse(!), which I guess is in line with the imagery of the cover and the concept of cyborgs.
B0000959N0|5.0|The director of Daredevil got it right! The respect that he has for the character is obvious and this is clearly a labor of love which rocks! Great cast, great action, and despite some less than stellar digital moments it's far better than many critics would have you believe. Daredevil isn't flawless, but then that's the beauty of the hero and the movie.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|An 80's spin on slapstick this movie takes the viewers on a rollercoaster ride of laughs with two hapless homeowners trying to live the American dream with little success. This is another one of those movies that has been and will continue to be a favorite for years to come. Sit back and enjoy.
B0000041Q3|5.0|As a Callas-Fan I GLADLY admit that this is the very best Turandot along with a live-recording featuring Nilsson and Corelli. Callas should have recorded it in 1949 (Her Turandot-excerpts from that year are BRILLIANT), Caballe is better as Liu than as Turandot... So who remains? Shrill Marton, miscast Ricciarelli, dull Eaglen etc. etc. Only one singer could have done it even better: EVA TURNER! She is THE Turandot in my book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DYJM6|4.0|THIS IS A MASTERPIECE! Every Pearl Jam fan should own this collection! If you don't own it buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!  You wont be dissapointed! =)
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Crap. Plain and simple. Long speeches, cardboard characters, unfathomable plot twists. YUK. I'm sure there are those out there ready to crucify me but come on....I guess the new Star Wars films are good, too? The original Matrix is a fantastic, fresh, sci-fi romp. Little or none of that made it to part two. Those that absolutely LOVED the 1st film will no doubt enjoy this mess. Of course, they also bought that hideous video game....but the rest of us will yawn and say &quot;Why was this such a great franchise?&quot;.
B0000DD79B|1.0|First of all, don't be fooled by the &quot;live&quot; recordings that the back cover shows: they are no prev. unreleased material, they're songs from the &quot;Live from New York City, 1967&quot; CD (Sony, 2002).<BR>So why would Sony release yet another Greatest hits album with material from just 8 months ago? Simply because S&amp;G are on tour. So if you want a good S&amp;G hits album, buy the one with the 2 guys walking on the beach at dusk. If you want an average live recording album, buy the one from last year. And if you want some really good material, then get The Columbia Studio Recordings 1964-1970 [BOX SET]. Of course you can always buy some unofficial wonderful records elsewhere... But that's another story.
0553212737|4.0|Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily.  It didn't.  I had to work to read Emma.<br />For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning.  She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all.  But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book.  So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl.  I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).<br />The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine.  More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax.  The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.<br />It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book.

B000001FAW|4.0|Not that I'm one to disagree with the Brothers Gibb  Children of The World is their smash 1976 release. The boys step up their success for Main Course with this album, what fans in the know consider to be their true `disco' album.<br />Again, disco isn't my favorite style, but sometimes you are just in the mood to dance.  Naturally, COTW's lead of track You Should Be Dancing fits the bill. Not one to listen to over and over in my opinion, but sometimes this song will come on the radio and you can almost forget that Travolta dance routine. Almost.<br />You Stepped Into My Life is the second track. Despite all this dance hype, Barry, Robin, and Maurice still manage to make their songs lyrically relevant. You Stepped Into My Life has some great words to it, if you can understand the falsetto! Love So Right continues this textbook Gibb ballad sound. The lyrics and arrangement are perfect. Even falsetto naysayers have to like this one. A Bee Gee staple.<br />Lovers is one of the songs on COTW I can play over and over and not get tired of it.  Barry and Robin combine several of their singing styles and it's a real treat to listen to. Can't Keep A Good Man Down is another Bee Gee song with an air of mischievousness about it. Robin sings what I swear is only his second fast lead prior to 1980. The music can annoy me sometimes, but the chorus in this song can really get you smiling and giggly.<br />Boogie Child was the flip side of Lovers, but I think it could have gone either way. Again you need to listen with mood. Boogie is a tad on the raunchy side!  Love Me, however, is a great song to cry to. My mother hates when I'm in a rut and listen to it over and over.  Children of the World seems to be well balanced between ballads and power dance tracks. Take your pick.<br />Subway is similar is style to Lovers, and I don't quite see what so special about going to the subway but hey! I always say to each his own when interpreting lyrics! The Way It Was returns to tear jerker mode, and will choke you up if your not careful.<br />The title track Children of The World is the last on the album. Again one of the songs I could take or leave. It seems to want to combine both the ballad style and dance rhythms. Although it has some great lyrics, it's not a daily listen for me. But one should never let the disco stigma stop you from listening. Children of the World is a great example of some serious and meaningful songs disguised as dance tracks. It's very versatile. Listen alone with your headphones or play it in the background at your next party. I guarantee people will dance and ask you who it is!mode, and will choke you up if your not careful. <br />The title track Children of The World is the last on the album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those of you who continually hold fast to the &quot;I'm upset, so I'm boycotting&quot; strategy of days gone by, look at Family Guy.  A cancelled show that, due to the unexpectedly overwhelming dvd sales observed by the network, brought a contract to resurrect the series.  While that's easier with the cartoon medium, it isn't too late for every show.  Give that a thought next time you observe a wrongly cancelled tv show go available for sale in the dvd format.  Cast your vote, before too much time passes.
B000001FNL|5.0|The Bee Gees launched their second career with this 1975 release. The brothers had changed their sound, and did not appear on the album cover. (I had a tough time explaining to my niece why the cover picture is a naked lady in a spoon!  )<br />Nights On Broadway was a hit, and brought about the birth of Barry's falsetto sound. It's excellently arranged and lyrically spectacular. Who hasn't been inspired by those gosh darn sappy love songs and dopey romance movies?!  Nights On Broadway perfectly captures that moment.<br />Now as much praise as I have for Broadway, Jive Talkin' is not one of my favorite songs.  In fact, it is one of three I nearly loathe. When this monster hit climbed the charts no one could believe it was the `Broken Hearted Bee Gees'. I was born after the Fever craze and had to almost relearn there was such a thing as the broken hearted sound. Jive is one of those songs that has probably been played to death. It's a shame, it isn't that bad, I suppose. To me the beat and voice arrangement seem at odds. You listen and decide<br />Wind of Change is the first song the brothers wrote for the album, indicating they were ready for a change. Main Course varies in style, and some dismiss it as a poorly constructed,uneven album. I disagree. There is something for everyone here. As much as I loathe the disco overkill, I like Wind of Change's heartfelt lyrics and disco sound. The brothers could have literally picked which style with which they wanted to continue.<br />My case in point is in the fourth track, Songbird. It's in the singer songwriter vein, similar to Elton John. Perhaps that's its one fault, but the verses are masterful. Each has subtle changes so it never sounds the same twice. Redundant in their lack of redundancy! Fanny Be Tender With My Love masters this idea. Each chorus is slightly different in arrangement, and you are just completely hooked and can't wait to hear what they do next. The one issue I have with Main Course is, like Mr. Natural before, there is no Maurice lead.  That being said, this may be the definitive Maurice album. Barry and Robin masterfully do Fanny's lead, but Mo owns the echoes and harmony this album.<br />All This Making Love is another style change. The brothers go back to their Beatle roots a bit. A bit of Gibby humor is evident here as well. The brothers' country roots, however, appear on Country Lanes and the subsequent Come on Over. Both Robin leads, the country style here fits his quavering sound perfectly.  Again we don't hear him much, but Country Lanes is made by Maurice's vocal addition. Come on Over's is lyrically excellent and was covered by Olivia Newton-John.<br />Edge of The Universe I take as the 'fun' song of the album. The brothers claim it's just about an alien and his dog, but I suspect something more mischievous!  It's also unusual at this time to hear Robin sing a more upbeat song. The lyrics are hysterical in their wackiness, and they will get stuck in your head.<br />As happy as Edge is, Baby As You Turn Away is a cleverly disguised sorrowful song.  Barry and Maurice lead this the final song on Main Course. The arrangement is masterful, and it's my favorite song on the album. Not every song on Main Course is for everyone, but it is a must in the budding fan's collection.ral before, there is no Maurice lead.  That being said, this may be the definitive Maurice album.

B00005QZWI|5.0|This cd is inspiring to every facet of one's creativity. I personaly listen to it when i am writing. There are distinct themes for the hobbits, elves, men and so on... each different but able to tie together, just like the Fellowship did in the book and in the movies. This soundtrack blended perfectly with the film. You would notice it but it wouldn't be distracting. It does what a good soundtrack should do... it tells the story in music along with the visual and speaking aspects of movies. You could listen to this soundtrack and picture the story in your mind, even if you haven't seen the film... mood is conveyed excellently in this cd... I recommend this to everyone. It's truly beautiful
0446310786|5.0|and I have read a lot of books.  The writing in this book is so delicious I could just bite off a chunk of the pages!  Scout is insightful looking back on her life as the daughter of a man willing to stand up against everything and still not necessarily win.  This book makes you a stronger person if you read it and realize that sometimes doing what's difficult is the best even if you get absolutely nothing from it.  Read this book and read it over and over all the years of your life.
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC, one of the only artists still out there today that still writes songs about getting some from a woman, drinking till you pass out and good old rock n roll.  On BACK IN BLACK (considered the best record in rock history), they sing about what every rock band should be singing about.  Album opener HELLS BELLS is a classic song with pure guitar rage and the bell they have in the beggining sets the stage for how powerful and heavy the album is going to be. BACK IN BLACK is one of the best songs in rock history.  Describing what rock artists do when they're off the stage and with lead guitarist Angus Young supplying one heck of a solo, shows the greatness they're are known for in their music.  Rock Ballad YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG is one of those songs that is considered a power ballad but you know in your rock-corrupted mind that it's pure rock.  To anyone who wants to listen to good old fashion rock n roll and just think about what the rock bands of today should be singing about, go get this cd. OR YOUR NOT ROCK N ROLL!!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This film is one of the most magnificent musicals ever to grace the big screen!  I am not going to repeat what most viewers have said about the wonderful story line, acting, choreography, and musical score.  Everything comes together perfectly, and the film's lesson on prejudice and violence applies even in these modern times more than ever.  This film should be in everyone's collection.  Even Leonard Maltin in his Movie Guide, gave this the top rating of 4 stars, and everyone knows that Maltin does not give out too many 4 star movies in his reviews.  My only gripe about the DVD (and many DVD's in general) has nothing to do with the film, but everything to do with the packaging.  When will these companies stop packaging these DVD's as if they contain the Hope Diamond inside?  It is annoying to have to scratch and peel off 3 sides of security tape in trying to pry open the case to get to the DVD!!!  It is a major inconvenience, and oftentimes, you can't help but damage or seriously scratch the case as you try and peel off all of that annoying tape.
B000002GJH|4.0|If you are checking this album out because you heard that the members of pearl jam and chris cornell of sound garden did it together before they got famous and want to give it a try, then you shall be satisfied with your findings.  this album is not able to rival ten, vitalogy, or vs. in the pearl jam catolog or batmotorfinger, superunknown, or down on the upside from the soundgarden catolog, but then again those albums are all classic.  this album is only darn close to classic.  when you listen to this album at length you will find that hungerstrike will easily get stuck in your head.  it is the albums gem.  say hello to heven, though, is also a very good song, and as you listen the album a couple of times, other tracks start sticking out, too, but those are the two best songs and the ones to remember . if you don't like hungerstrike don't buy this album, you will have wasted your money.  in that sentence alone i have summed up the whole album.  don't get me wrong, i love this album, and if you like pearljam you  will too, but hungerstrike is the main track. if you were expecting a lot of singing from vedder than you will be dissapointed, chris cornell sings lead on everything but hungerstrike, and eddie only sings back up on about three other tracks.  The majority of the material is written solely by cornell, although gosard and ament contribute on three tracks.  this is a very important album, though.  It was made as a memorial to andrew wood the deceased singer of motherlovebone from which ament and gossard came from.  Wood was also the roommate of cornell. they got together after his overdose on heroin and made this album.  if your wondering how vedder fits in, it's kinda a lucky break how he got here.  he got a hold of a demo of gossard and ament's, dubbed his vocals over it, and sent it to them, and they liked it, thus pearljam was born after the temple of the dog sessions. anways, this is a good album all in all. i payed twenty dollars for it(at the mall), and while that's more than i usually pay for a cd it is worth it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is my favourite singer because she is individual, and she is able to be herself no matter what people say. She also has the best singing voice.<br />Her first self titled album was good, but 'Stripped' is alot more better because she put all her heart into her songs like this cd is her personal diary.<BR>She sings so many different types of songs with different emotions on this album, from her first raunchy single 'Dirrty' to her emotional number 1 hit 'Beautiful'. In her other hits 'Fighter', 'Can't hold us down' and 'the Voice Within' and every other song on the 'Stripped' album shows us who the real Christina is, and not only that, many girls like me can relate to her songs and we discover that we are not alone.<BR>Another good thing about this album is that she doesn't pretend to be something that she isn't. I also went to her 'Stripped' tour in Australia and it was the best concert I've ever been to.<BR>I hope you will buy this album because it is worth it and it will be one of your favourite albums of all time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My daughter received the dvd for the holidays. None of us had seen it when it aired on Fox. We watched the pilot and then had a marathon watching the rest of the season.  It is funny, character driven, moving, and full of surprises that had us laughing outloud. How could anyone have let this show get away?<BR>I want more, more, more!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the broadway place twice and LOVED it.  It is my new favorite musical.  It is definitely one of the better plays on broadway.  The soundtrack is fantastic.  Both lead women have powerful voices.  Different styles that compliment each other very nicely.  This is a soundtrack that will keep you humming the tunes.  My daugter, 11, also loved the play and the soundtrack.  I highly recommend seeing the play and buying the soundtrack.
B00009RDG9|1.0|You'd think with two major stars (Tommy Lee Jones &amp; Benicio Del Toro) this movie would work, but these two guys have absolutely no on screen chemistry whatsoever.  But, they are not totally too blame.  The plot is very weak, meandering, and basically nonsensical.  The chase scenes are typical Hollywood action cliches.  This movie was billed as a suspense drama, but the only suspense I encountered was when it was going to end.  Thankfully, Benicio Del Toro can be forgiven for this movie after seeing his marvelous performance in 21 grams.  The same can be said for Tommy Lee Jones, as he did a good job in The Missing.  As for William Friedkin, a once brilliant Director has now been involved in two stinkers in a row.  Hopefully, his next project will be indicitive of the William Friedkin of the past.
0385512104|5.0|This is half mystery, half coming-of-age story, except it's for someone who *can't* come of age in the usual ways: Christopher Boone is autistic and the book is quite clear that he's not going to ever be normal, go through the rituals of adolescence and adulthood, connect. Christopher discovers the neighbor's dog impaled on her front lawn with a garden fork, and determines to get to the bottom of the mystery. (He greatly admires Sherlock Holmes for his logical cast of mind, and likes mystery stories because they obey definite rules. Christopher is all about rules.) The entire book is told from Christopher's point-of-view, in a flat clear logical style: it is often very, very funny and sometimes very, very sad. It's clear how difficult and heartbreaking it is to live with an autistic person, with someone who will never respond to or offer affection in normal ways; I held my breath in a few places, afraid of a happy Disney ending, but Haddon never falters once.
B000002UDB|2.0|There is a maximum of 3 or 4 good songs on this album and it is generally recognized as being one of the Beatles' weakest.  Anyone who thinks that all of the tracks are good needs to listen to some more music!
B00005R5G9|3.0|Meschach Taylor, known to millions as \\"Anthony\\" on the old \\"Designing Women\\" show takes control of every scene in which he is featured.  Of course, the part is stereotypical but most Hollywood productions rarely stray from their preconceived notions of how people behave, be they straight, gay, foreign, rural, or even urban.  His role simply reflects what the \\"men in the suits\\" felt was appropriate for a window dresser.<br />The film is mindless and was not intended to be an Oscar contender.<br />It should be seen as part of a double bill with another Andrew McCarthy opus: \\"Weekend at Bernie's\\".<br />Both are entertaining fare, nothing more and nothing less.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I honestly like all DT albums pretty much the same and this is no differient. If your more of a fan of there Rush-like progressive stuff, you probably won't be into this album. If your into real in-your-face metal. You'll love this album. This a Deam Theater that is raw and agressive. That having been said. There is still plenty of guitar solos, awesome drumming, bass playing, and keybeord work buy the band. This is not &quot;slick&quot; production wise but its not crappy like Metallica's St. Anger album. I can make out some parallels to old school Metallica and even some of the newer metal out there today but the thing is that is still plenty of guitar solos and individual vertuosity by the band. Not to mention that the guitars although detuned, ARE STILL IN TUNE. As differient as this album is, you can still make out that its Dream Theater. Listen to the sound clips and you'll get a good overall feel for the album.
B00005N5S5|5.0|5 Stars for originality, story, effects and action!  The DVD is solid too, with a fair amount of extras.<br />Some of you may remember when we all feared the Ruskies would nuke us any day -- this film capitalized on that fear and introduced us all to a new terror -- the evils of machines rising up against mankind.  Plot revolves around deadly battle/chase to stop a cyborg sent back thru time.  Many other reviewers will relate every detail, but I suggest you watch the movie.  Keep in mind this was the one that started it, before the matrix and all the others.  Film has a dark tone that is compelling.  Lots of action, weapons, and some Sci-Fi but not too much.  Man vs his creation in a sci-fi tech nightmare.  That theme has since been redone several times since in many ways.  The Terminator set the bar for Tech Noir films, and is the best of the series of three (T2 Judgement Day and T3 Rise of the Machines).  Ironic that after all the Hollywood destruction now the Terminator \\"runs\\" California. . . Rise of the Machine?  This movie is the role that defined Schwarzenagger's career more than any other.  See the DVD and you'll know what I mean.<br />The Special Edition Terminator DVD is worth the price!  Quality of sound and video is excellent, bearing in mind that it is almost 20 years old now.  Effects are awesome for the 80's.  But Cameron's original Terminator was made without a major budget, and before Arnold was a big star.  Still they pulled it off nicely!  Not as much as later version, but the Extras (artwork, trailers, deleted scenes, & a sort of screenplay) on this DVD are worthy of the $15 price.  I just watched it again, go get yours.  This version (special ed) is worthy of a place in your collection too, although a boxed set may be coming out with all three sometime.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I heard that Josh Whedon was coming out with a space sci-fi show, I got really excited.  When I heard it described as &quot;Wagontrain in space&quot;, I got worried.  Once I show the first show, I was hooked.<br />Stop and ask yourself why &quot;Star Wars&quot; was a hit.  Then ask yourself why the prequels stink.  <br />This show has fully developed characters ... and they are interesting!  You want to know more about them.  You fall in love with some, you hate some, but you will have an emotional reaction to each and every one.  *THAT* is good writing.<br />The premise is cool, even if the western theme gets a little corny at times.  Still, it works!  <br />If this show had gotten a better timeslot, better marketing and not cost as much per episode, everyone would be reading about (and watching) the new run-away hit &quot;Firefly&quot;.  <br />If you like &quot;old school&quot; sci-fi and/or space opera, this is your show.  If you like a show with cool characters that suck you into the plot, this is your show.  Get it, watch it, and long for the Firefly movie that is coming.

B00008EY9G|5.0|This is just the type of movie I want to see when I hire a thriller.  Plenty of action, plenty of atmosphere, good actors and an unguessable plot.  Ten strangers seek refuge in a seedy motel to escape a storm and one by one they start being knocked off.  Who or what is responsible and why have they been brought together?  The plot sounds pretty cliched, but is it? or is something else at foot here?  This movie isn't particularly frightening or suspenseful, but it does have its more disturbing moments, particularly towards the finale.  <br />Overall, this is an enjoyable suspense movie that saves its best till last.  Identity is well directed and manages to maintain a high tempo plot while creating an uneasy atmospheric quality.  The actors are all well cast and the chemistry between them works well.  Everyone seems at home in their roles and this makes the movie very enjoyable.  I walked away from this feeling very satisfied that I had got value for my money.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Once again mainstream music has proven itself to be complete garbage. The lyrics are simple and dull and the sound is repetitive and boring. Similar, equally untalented, and media hyped bands include the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Strokes, Bowling for Soup, and the Hives. If you want real music with real, complex, and thought provoking lyrics check out Thrice, Thursday. Also recommend Senses Fail, Saosin, A Static Lullaby, Rufio, Yellowcard, Brand New, Dogwood, and Funeral For A Friend. <BR>Look into drive thru records if you want good pop punk. Just stay away from the White Stripes and clones like them.
0767840135|5.0|This is definitely the best Cirque DVD there is.<BR> <BR>Let's start with the video quality:<BR>It is so good for a minute, I thought I was in Amsterdam, (Which is where it was filmed.)<br />The sound is so exellent I think it was better than the Big Top.<br />I have seen Varekai (Live and not live.), Mystere, (Live), Dralion (Not Live), Quidam (Not Live), Saltimbanco (Not live), Nouvelle Experence (Not Live and Cirque Reinvente (Not live.)<br />So out of all of the ones I haven't seen live, I think Quidam is the best.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad was the book that started it all for me. Now I realize that a house is not the asset I thought it was. I realize that my [former] boss was not the great guy I thought he was nor was the company that I worked for doing me any special favors either.<br />I always had a dream to be my own boss and when I read Rich Dad Poor Dad, I felt that Rich Dad was talking directly to me. I had been brainwashed by the educational system and then corporate America. It is a rat race out there and I felt like a rat.<br />What a pleasure it is now to own my life. To own my own business. To be in control. And to be able to share what I know with friends via the Rich Dad series of books. <br />Over the holidays, our family enjoyed a educational experience with the Rich Dad Board Game's. We also bought the childrens version for our three daughters. What a way to start them on the road to financial freedom!<br />Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki for sharing the knowledge that your Rich Dad shared with you. We are looking forward to a great 2004 and a great rest of our lives. Before being Kiyosaki-ized we had a lot of doubts.<br />Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
0385504209|2.0|As a lapsed Catholic, I couldn't help but find the premise of this book somewhat intriguing.  I didn't know much about it beyond some references to &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and some secret involving the role of women in the early Church, but it all sounded like good historical fun.  The book, however, is a disappointment.  The first problem is that all the characters are essentially looking for a trunk full of &quot;secret&quot; documents, the contents of which are already public knowledge.  To build suspense, Brown sets up a series of implausible events, none of which are really necessary beyond their mechanistic contribution to the plot.  The codes and puzzles are obvious, and the fact that you as the reader can figure them out well in advance of the characters, who are allegedly experts at this sort of thing, makes you wonder why you should care about such transparently obtuse people. There's quite a bit of simplistic wordplay and a series of final &quot;surprises&quot; that are neither surprising or especially clever.  Brown is such a poor mystery writer that he telegraphs everything many pages ahead.  It does not help that Brown has no ear for the English language.  His style is awkward and leaden, and his characters say truly awful things no human being would ever say in real life, unless he or she were reading this book aloud.  There is also a great deal of empty-headed posturing about the &quot;sacred feminine,&quot; in a first-year Women's Studies class kind of way.  Tiresome.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|its on schedule. Look, its heavy, kinda dark in some places.  Yes, its a much different sound for DT than many of us are used to.  I give them credit for trying something new.  I actually like the disk.  'Honor Thy Father' and 'Stream' are nice songs...even the high-speed keys/guitar sync solos are done well.  But, think about this.<BR>DT are allowed to put out a less than perfect disk.  Actually, its right on time.  Look at it this way: Images and Words = Scences from a Memory; Awake = 6DoIT and; Train of Thought = Falling into Infinity (which we all know was a poor effort).  So...whats next you ask?  Late 2004/ early 2005, a double-live cd (just life Once in a LT)OR a double DVD.  I know my DT.  Later
0452282152|4.0|I read this book in 2 days and really had a hard time putting it down.  I found the character of Griet interesting.  It was a nice insight to the life in Holland in the 1660's.  Vermeer was a talented artist and this story takes a look of the possibility behind the identity of the girl in the portrait.  However, I did wish more time was actually spent with the artist than in the laundry room.<br />The pregnant wife of Vermeer was nasty and if she was truly like that, I wonder if he would have gotten her pregnant so often. (They had 11 children.)  She didn't seem to understand her own husband and the pairing was unbelievable, especially when the story indicated at the underlying attraction between the maid Griet and the artist.<br />It will be interesting to see this book turned into a movie with Colin Firth as Johannes Vermeer.  I just hope they give him more screentime than the book indicated.
B00009MGGI|5.0|Ian Richardson, who is always superb, reaches his highest level yet with his portrayal of Francis Urquhart in this trilogy about the rise and fall of a British Prime Minister.<br />In House of Cards we meet Francis Urquhart (FU to his friends and enemies alike) as the Tory Chief Whip in a House of Commons led by a nice but ineffectual Conservative Prime Minister.  At first FU seems to be giving us a friendly tour of the British governmental process with a sympathetic eye for the troubles of his PM, but then slowly but surely, he reveals the knives he proceeds to plunge into the backs of all his rivals.  He's charming but brutally direct as he takes step after step, including a couple of murders, towards 10 Downing Street.<br />To Play The King is my favorite of the series.  FU has to deal with an idealistic young king who disapproves of his hardline conservative policies.  Even though we know FU will win in the end, we hope for his downfall while simultaneously cheering his audacity.  FU is as charming as ever, even when he's at his vilest and most murderous.<br />The Final Cut is the weakest of the three because FU is more of a victim than a villain during most of it.  At the end we are sorry to see FU go even while we are relieved that his murderous ways are at last at an end.  And, most intriguingly, we see his successor, supposedly a reformer but possibly already taking on the FU mold. (Unfortunately no one seems to have considered carrying on the story by chronicling his successor's PMship.<br />An interesting footnote to this series has to do with the books they were based upon.  Only the third series actually faithfully follows the book.  In the first two series the books actually have FU coming to a well deserved end.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|How do i begin...first and foremost i have to congratulate Gavin Degraw for his soulful voice, profound lyrics, and great music.  I have love for pop and all sorts of music but i have an extremely high standard for the male singer and song-writers.  I had bought John Mayor's latest CD and I wasn't extremely impressed.  But with Gavin's music, I just can't get enough of it.  Standout tracks are &quot;Follow through&quot;, &quot;Just Friends&quot;, &quot;Chariot&quot;, &quot;I Don't Wanna Be&quot; (theme song of One Tree Hill), &quot;Chemical Party&quot;, and &quot;Belief&quot;.  Basically, the whole CD is a masterpiece.  Gavin Degraw provides the freshness, soul, and intensity that many male singer and song-writers lack.
B00007AJIT|4.0|This is a strikingly original film that is part science fiction, part love triangle romance, and part comedy with an undercurrent of psychological insight into human relationships, marred slightly by some familiar elements in the resolution.  Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script, and Spike Jonze who directed, are to be commended for being so daring and free with the usual notions of reality while callously demonstrating just how selfish human relationships can be.  To analyze this film is very much beside the point, but I'm going to do a little bit of that anyway.<br />John Cusack stars as an out of work puppeteer with a cheating heart.  Cameron Diaz is his hard-working mousey little wife who supports him and a menagerie of animals including a chimpanzee ensconced in their New York apartment.  An early scene shows her going off to work while Cusack rolls over and goes back to sleep.  Catherine Keener enters the scene with her big smile and long legs as a supremely confident amoral user of people and quickly becomes the focus of the triangle as both Cusack and Diaz fall in madly in love with her.  She, however, is not so enamored.  She is not attracted to Cusack at all and tells him so, and finds Diaz interesting but only after seeing her adoring eyes inside the eyes of John Malkovich, who plays himself.<br />Offbeat enough?  Not yet.  Cusack has met Keener through his new job as a fast-fingered file clerk at a data storage firm with offices on the seventh and a half floor in a New York high rise.  The floor is just about four and a half feet high (low overhead!) so that everybody has to bend over whenever they stand up.  Orson Bean plays the head of the firm who is 110 years old or so with Mary Kay Place as his annoying secretary.  While filing Cusack drops a folder behind a filing cabinet.  He pulls out the cabinet and lo and behold discovers a little Alice in Wonderland door.  He opens it and crawls forward in the dark and swoosh! is drawn into the person of actor John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life.  Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing.  He is BEING John Malkovich!<br />Okay, we have our strikingly original premise.  Where the film goes from here is the tough part.  It includes some funny shtick and some intriguing ideas about identity, a prospect for immortality, Malkovich being turned into a puppet, some unusual sex games, a couple of appearances by Charlie Sheen as his contemporary self and later as a balding middle aged man, ending with the resolution of the triangle and a hint of a possible sequel.  I was entertained mainly because of the strong performances by Keener, Cusack, Malkovich and Diaz.  I was somewhat disappointed that the last part of the film did not live up to the beginning in terms of originality.  The old people waiting for rebirth reminded me of something out of Cocoons (1985).  But Cusack's prospective life as a little girl was a chuckle to contemplate, and I couldn't help but applaud Keener's sly triumph.  But enough of these beguiling hints about what happens.  See it for yourself.r John Malkovich, who is going about his daily life.  Cusack looks out and sees what John is seeing, hears what John is hearing, experiences what John is experiencing.

B000001FGG|5.0|Wheels Of Fire would be Cream's 3rd and final album released while they were still together. This was issued in 1968 when many rock bands, starting with the Beatles, would become more experimental with their studio releases. This would also be the first album to showcase their phenomenal live act.<br />Disc 1 is the studio disc and it's here where producer Felix Pappalardi would become almost as important to Cream as producer George Martin was to the Beatles. His use of many stringed instruments on tracks such as \\"Passing The Time\\", \\"Those Were The Days\\", and \\"Pressed Rat And Warthog\\" added a diversity that wasn't present on their first two releases. Although the songs here aren't as catchy as on Disraeli Gears, the haunting \\"As You Said\\", the driving \\"Deserted Cities Of The Heart\\", and especially the huge hit single \\"White Room\\" are among the best tracks they ever recorded. Their blues roots are still present here on the strong tracks \\"Sitting On Top Of The World\\", \\"Politician\\", and their killer version of Albert King's \\"Born Under A Bad Sign.\\" Upon listening to this disc, it's apparent that Cream were clearly becoming Jack Bruce's band as his excellent vocals and bass playing are clearly the highlight here. Ginger Baker and especially Eric Clapton's playing here is more restrained when compared to their previous albums.<br />But Disc 2 is where the entire band shines like the sun. Cream were the first to take the improvisation of jazz and combine it with rock music and the results here are stunning. \\"Crossroads\\" has become synonymous with Clapton and his playing on this track, particularly his second solo, is among his most intense. Bruce's \\"Traintime\\" features some of the most fiery harmonica playing ever recorded. Then there's Baker's tour-de-force \\"Toad\\", which despite its 16-minute length, is creative throughout and shows why he is one of the best drummers ever. But the best track here is their version of \\"Spoonful\\" which truly shows the band at the peak of its powers and features some of the best jamming you'll ever hear. 35 years later this track still sounds amazing. While Disraeli Gears is a more consistent album overall, Wheels Of Fire is a better representation of what Cream were all about. Highly recommended.ts powers and features some of the best jamming you'll ever hear. 35 years later this track still sounds amazing.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's hard to understand why a series like &quot;Firefly&quot; is still not on the air, but thank goodness for DVD- now the world can watch all the episodes of this very satisfying series without the mindless pressure of &quot;ratings&quot; and lowest common denominator appeal to dilute what is a very thoughtful and well produced show. Each character is well drawn, well acted and the series mythology is deep and resonant with attributes of pop culture excepting the ususal science fiction cliches. There are no aliens on &quot;Firefly&quot; but there are wonderful values that I find perfect from the first frame to the last.
B00004BZ16|4.0|There is a lot of garbage on this album, but all will be forgiven when you hear songs like, the Magnificent Seven, Junco Partner, Something About England, Somebody Got Murdered, Corner Soul, Police On My Back, Washington Bullets, and Charlie Don't Surf. Those aren't the only ones but you get the point.<BR>This album will make you angry because you will see all the greatness shining through the mess. This could have been an amazing double album, maybe better than London Calling. Some of it is so bizarre that I advise you not to listen to it late at night when you are alone. <BR>Overindulgent but great, I would take this over the very similar, yet more celebrated (but in my opinion grossly overrated) White Album by the grossly overrated Beatles.

B0000648WZ|4.0|Starship Troopers -- a chameleon of a movie if there ever was one.  Is it a B-Grade sci-fi action flick?  A story of young love?  A harrowing vision of a negative utopia -- a society equating fascistic, militristic conformity with freedom and citizenship?  A criticism of the xenophobic militaristic rhetoric, reducing \\"enemies\\" to mindless animals?  <br />I guess the movie is all those things.  And it accomplishes many of them very well.  In fact, upon repeated viewings 90% of the film can be read as a damning social critique, that is until the clumsy, poorly scripted ending unravels the social commentary, creating confusion.  Is this movie really a condemnation of cultural homogenization and racism?  Or is it a Boo-Ya gorefest that ultimately reinforces the notion that white, westernized human beings are the pre-ordained rulers of civilization?  <br />One thing is for sure, this movie is not simply an action flick.  Like Robocop, Verhoven is attempting to explore the darker side of modern civilization, cleverly couching that commentary in a bright, color soaked, sterile world where even the horrifying results of war appear to be fake.  <br />This movie could've been brilliant, but fails to tie up loose ends necessary to the movie's impact.

HTTT, although a tad glumy hopefully marks the return of Radiohead to writing some of the greatest rock songs ever.  This album seems to be a mix of Amnesiac/Kid A and Bends/OKComp.  Give this a couple of listens bc it will definitely grow on you and slowly take over your CD player.  Hail to the Thief certainly lives up to its name.
B00013RC66|4.0|Debra Winger plays a detective who is on the trail of a psychopathic woman. She quickly meets, \\"falls in love\\" and then marries her man, but soon kills him before moving onto the next man repeating the process all over again. When the detective finally locates her in Hawaii, she meets her and the two become friends. As she investigates the woman's web of lies and murder, the woman becomes suspicious of her. When she finally discovers that her friend is a detective, it becomes a deadly rollercoaster ride as she repeatedly tries to kill her. Some of the best scenes were... poisoning the wine scene, the scuba-diving scene, the scalding shower scene, and the end scene.
B00008J4P5|3.0|The success of this band, and their legions of drooling fans, leads me to believe that too many people have not been educated, music-wise, that is.  Pick up some early 70s proto-punk, mix it with some traditional blues music, toss in some minimalistic post-punk music, and pour on a generous helping of advertising and you get, voila:  the White Stripes.  Perhaps the most overrated band of the last twenty years.  <br />The album itself is, IMO, unremarkable.  There's nothing more inherently exciting about Jack White's lyrics or playing, than what you would find in any number of more innovative, and less obnoxious, albums.  Let's hope the hype dies down soon.
6303257844|1.0|This movie is excellent - if you don't realise that it is supposed to be serious. If you think that it is a parody of action movies then it is great. Reeves' over the top deep macho voice is hilarious, and the women all cry and panic whilst the men all say &quot;grrr&quot; and make smart-alec quips - think Brad and Janet in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. The characters are extremely shallow and unbelievable - one minute Bullock is freaking out, and the next she is coyly flirting with Reeves. If you want intentional hilarious parody then I'd recommend &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; instead.
B0000025D0|5.0|That would be a gross understatement.<BR>This is the single greatest creation of all time.<BR>Dylan may be better than Springsteen but he never made Darkness on The Edge of Town.
B00008US8R|5.0|If only classical music always sounded this good or...if only rock music always sounded this pleasant. Anyways, Amy Lee's goddess of a voice and the industrial/grunge band make for one hell of a musical oddysey.
B0000A36J1|5.0|I loved the theatrical version of this movie, but the additions in the Special Extended Edition take this film to a whole new level.  While the plot flows fine without them, they add new depth to the characters.  I thought the additions for Merry and Pippin especially were hilarious, adding, among other material, a fight over the Entwater and over which one is taller, as well as a brief allusion to the missing Old Man Willow.  Gollum, meanwhile, has expanded scenes showing his insane lust for the Ring, which make him seem both more treacherous and more pitiable.  While most of the additions are fairly minor scenes, an entire segment has been added at the end, which makes the connection from the end of this movie to the start of the Return of the King flow much better.<br />Furthermore, while I am not typically a fan of Widescreen format, I have to say that it is nearly essential here.  The cinematography of this film is absolutely beautiful, and the modified format really loses a great deal of the epic grandeur.  <br />With an extra 43 minutes it is getting slightly long for viewing in one sitting (although the two tape VHS division does make a convenient breakpoint), but I would still definitely recommend the Special Extended Version.
B00009Y3S9|4.0|What does it take for a woman director to get an Oscar nomination these days? I'm an artist and was blown away by director Julie Taymor's sumptuous lighting and photography and quick editing which made the story flow smoothly without the story stopping in its tracks. She has directed rings around male directors who get Oscar noms for a whole lot less effect! Girls, ya gotta break up the &quot;good ol' boys (hacks) club&quot; in Hollywood so that you can start getting some of these well-deserved awards.<br />Anyway, I was completely swept into the story, not knowing a whole lot about Frida except for the life long consequences of her accident and philandering husband. The screenplay was excellent and didn't leave too many open questions about her life. I only wish there had been more about painting than about her love life, but I think this was so the story would appeal more to the masses.<br />Salma Hayek did an extremely competent acting job as she always does (as far as acting, looks and class goes, she leaves the &quot;attention junkie&quot; J-Lo in the B-movie bin where she belongs! Can you say &quot;Gigli&quot;?!)She should be very proud of this quality film that she fought to bring to the screen. I rented it, watched it several times and even had dreams about it all night. If you're looking for intelligent fare, this is it.
B000002LQR|5.0|If you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers then this CD is a must.  It is a classic.  I think that this CD is the most definative CD for the band.  It includes every aspect of their very original sound.  There are the funky rock songs that we all know and love like \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and \\"Give It Away\\", but this was also when they started experimenting with a slower more emotional sound with songs like \\"Could Have Lied\\" and \\"Under The Bridge.\\" There are also songs that don't leave a whole lot to the imagination, which only build on the reputation they started with the whole sock thing. they aren't hinting at anything with \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\".  But over all it's a great album and one of the Red Hot Chili Peppers best.  A must have, even if your not a fan.
B000002UDB|4.0|For starters, the best songs on here are I Am The Walrus, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and maybe Fool On The Hill.  Baby Your A Rich Man and Hello Goodbye are very solid pop-psychedelic tunes as well. Magical Mystery Tour and All You Need Is Love seem simply silly and outdated. The rest of the songs that haven't been mentioned do not strike the listener as much. This album was patched together from Pepper outtakes and singles from the 1967 era.  People seem to think that anything the Beatles touched turned to gold.  Magical Mystery tour is proof (as well as Help, For Sale, and Pepper) that the Beatles made quite a few uneven albums that have not stood the test of time very well.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love Actually is a great romantic comedy and one of the best films of the year! This film is so rich with great characters, love stories and laughs to make it one of the best and most original romantic comedies made in a long while. There are at least 12 main characters whose stories are interwoven together to make a great love story or love stories. Hugh Grant as London's prime minister is a great fit and his story is probably the funniest. Grant makes every role better with his witty personality and seeing him dance around his house to the Pointer Sisters is hilarious. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman's story provides the most heartwrenching arch of the story as a comfortably married couple who gets shaken by infidelity. Emma Thompson is especially wonderful as the adoring mother and wife shocked by her husband's actions, yet strong enough to deal with it. Colin Firth's story line is the most sweet as a cuckhold who moves to a secluded place and falls for his Portugese maid. The most heartwarming part of the story goes to Liam Neeson, who plays a widow helping with his stepson's love life. Keira Knightley, Laura Linney and Rowan Atkinson also have parts in the story, as well as two porn stand-ins who fall in love while working together and a horny British guy who goes to America to find women. The porn stand-ins are great because they fall in love because they genuinely like eachother's personality, and people should stop complaining about it. They are probably the sweetest characters in this film. Bill Nighy steals the film as a has been rock star who sings a very cheesy Christmas song that is heard throughout the film. The movie's message of love comes through loud and clear and should not be taken lightly. Love Actually is actually a great film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|OK, I have always had a guilty pleasure of listening to the Miss Britney Spears, but around my town, it's not something you want to bump around in your system.  I finally have to hand it to Britney.  Even though I've always been a HUGE fan, I have to say this is by far her best album!  Not only did she make a great breakthrough with the Queen of pop herself ( Madonna ), but she finally put some hip-hop and r&amp;b groove into her beats, while managing to stay true to her pop roots - and her southern roots I might add, with track # 2 featuring the Ying Yang Twins. Track 3- Showdown and track 6- Toxic, in my opinion are going to be pretty big hits along with any other single she decides to come out with from this album.  The reggae song (track 9 i think??)isn't all that great, but hey- she tried. It's good for a club.  And the remix for Me against The Music could have been better.And oh my God! Did she sing about masturbating? I love it! You rock girl! The background music to that song is great  (the violin). Keep 'em comin' Britney!
B00000J7JO|5.0|After problems with band members throughout the 1990's, the Red Hot Chili Peppers saw the decade out in 1999 with their now-classic seventh studio album &quot;Californication.&quot; Many people call this album a masterpiece - but it is so much more. The first Chili Peppers album I bought was 2002's &quot;By The Way,&quot; which I absolutely adored. It was my second favourite album of the year, and is still my favourite album by this band. Over time though Californication could change all that.<br />This album was a huge success upon its initial release and went multi-platinum all over the world. The music from the Chili Peppers had evolved slightly. They were no longer young twenty-something guys, but in their thirties and a changed was inevitable. This is reflected in their music and the way it is performed more so than before. From the opening song on the album you're taken on a roller coaster ride of funk rock-pop. The guitars are as loud as before, but the melodies just carry on getting better forming some real classics along the way.<br />&quot;All Around The World&quot; is the perfect opening to an album. A loud shout and hectic guitars make way for the funky rapping before the harmonic chorus and backing vocals. Anthony Kiedis' vocals are on top form on this explosive album highlight. &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; continues the funky trend with a high-octane bass and a fuzzy distorted chorus. It's not only an album highlight, but a career highlight as it's different to anything they've ever done before. &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; changes the pace dramatically. This hit single is a beautiful, calming and wonderfully melodic rock ballad. The vocals are soft and understated, and the beat just sways. My only complaint is that it's a bit too short. &quot;Otherside&quot; is another album highlight. The chorus is instantly ear-catching and the beat is incredibly strong and driving. It's the kind of song you can listen to over and over.<br />&quot;Get On Top&quot; returns us out of that soft and atmospheric nature of the last two songs, with driving guitars and funky beats. The funk on this album being different to all their other albums is clearly evident here, as it has a superbly melancholy tone. &quot;Californication,&quot; the album's title track, is nothing short of a masterpiece. The guitars and drums on this song give it such a visual and atmospheric feel to it. It's so ethereal and majestic, with soaring vocals and the computer-game video was so amazing. &quot;Easily&quot; picks up on the rock feel once more, and is a stand out because it's so simple and addictive at the same time. &quot;Porcelain&quot; is probably the most hated song on this album by a lot of fans, but I like it a lot. It's the most simple and subdued song on the album, and also one of the shortest. Shows a diverse side to the Chili Peppers.<br />&quot;Emit Remmus&quot; is another superb song on the album, with a superb and stand out chorus. All the choruses on this album just stand out, and the one on this song is no exception. &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; picks up the funk trend once more, but is different to most of the other songs on this album. It's not the best song on the album and somewhat of a disappointment being surrounded by all these amazing songs. &quot;This Velvet Glove&quot; has some amazing lyrics, that are so simple yet extremely thought-provoking. The Chili Peppers create a mid-tempo rock classic here. It's an album highlight and one of my favourites. &quot;Savior&quot; is a song written clearly about John Frusciante re-joining the band. The song has a different variation to the rest of the songs and ends wonderfully.<br />&quot;Purple Stain&quot; has a great bass and the melody is incredibly memorable. I don't like the lyrics much, but the guitars make up for it. &quot;Right On Time&quot; is a pretty light-hearted song with a fair bass and some very funky lyrics. You can't even understand what Kiedis is singing about unless you read the lyrics on the inlay, but the song is so short at under two minutes that it doesn't really matter. After the abrupt ending of the last track, &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; picks it up. This is a slow and soothing song which is very vivid and has some great melodies. It's a great song to end such a superb album.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br />The release of By The Way in 2002 saw many new fans embrace the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I was one of them. I knew who they were before, but just didn't seem exposed to them enough. As you grow older your musical taste changes and for me, a following of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' music was to be expected. I bought Californication a few weeks back, and I adore it. I knew most of the songs before because I listened to my friend's copy for ages, so I knew I would love it. This album is always sitting rather high in people's all-time favourite lists, and I'm sure that it'll be in yours if you buy it today! An essential purchase.rics on the inlay, but the song is so short at under two minutes that it doesn't really matter. After the abrupt ending of the last track, &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; picks it up.

B000002MTR|5.0|This Album was a different turn for the Peppers.  But I believe it was an important one.  This CD is by far the bands darkest, but with good reason.  At the time John Frusciante was about to die, from his battle with herione and the rest of the boys were having trouble getting adjusted to the new guitarist.  Dave Navarro did a great job though, he stepped up to bat, and in my mind hit a home run.  The great thing about this album is how it fits in with the rest of Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog. Their albums are almost biographical.  You can tell what the band is going through with each different album, even from their very first one.  This was a landmark step for them in their evolution as a band.  If your a fan, you should appreciate this album (regardless of the fact that they had a new guitarist) but if your not a fan, this album may be a little too experimental for you.
B0000TB014|3.0|My contribution to the Michael Jackson legal defense fund.  I found it lacking.  I was happy to see the particular songs included, but for the DVD vs. the CD, I think they should have given us more.  &quot;Bad&quot; is the short version, as if you're suddenly just dropped into the middle of the video.  &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is the frenetic version, with the entire video speeding along like a picture of star-tracking.  I was sorely disappointed in this in particular, because I love this stylish video.  Oh, and for the last reviewer, Michael IS in &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, right near the end in the shot with the little kids in, I assume, Africa.  Watch it again, it's very brief.  I also thought the quality in the earlier videos was really grainy; they must have been able to do SOMETHING to clean it up a bit.  It looked amateurish.  That all having been said, it is a great collection of MTV versions of his videos, but I'll stick with his History DVDs for the long versions, which are always better.  I was also disappointed that they didn't include &quot;Ghosts&quot; on here, or &quot;Say, Say, Say&quot;, which I can't find on any of his DVDs.
B00005JMFI|4.0|Elf is a wonderful holiday film starring Will Ferrell, who hits a home run as Buddy, a man raised by elves on the North Pole who decides to go to New York City to find his father. Watching Buddy discover NYC is the best part of the film and Ferrell does a great job of showing Buddy's innocence and joy at seeing this city. These scenes should make even the grumpiest person laugh aloud. While the film is very formulatic, it still delivers because of the freshness that Ferrell brings and it will be a holiday classic for years to come.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I was a casual Coldplay fan.  That is, what I knew of them was from the radio.  I had always thought that the songs I heard were pretty good.  After reading the reviews, I decided, &quot;What the heck, I'll go ahead and check it out&quot;.  Thank goodness I did.  What a great concert DVD!<br />Concerning bad sound quality: I didn't hear anything that stood out noticibly.  It sounded great to me.  Concerning 'artsy' camera work:  I could see it taking some people a bit to get used to.  The camera definitely does not stay put for more than 4 seconds, but the effect it creates is really cool I thought.  I really enjoyed it.  It seemed as if there were 20+ angles used on each song.  But, if you're not expecting this and want the camera to just stay put, you might be irked.  Overall, I love watching the concert.  Each song could literally be put out as a video.  I have watched it about 5 times over the past 2 months and love turning it on when it's late and I'm in the mood to crank the music.  It's a very dark concert and the effect is complete with the camerawork.  Wow, if you are looking for a live concert DVD and you enjoy Coldplay even casually, buy this for your collection.  You won't be disappointed.  Thank you Coldplay!
0316096199|5.0|&quot;Lucky&quot;, by Alice Sebold is a wonderful book from the viewpoint of a rape victim and how it affected her in her daily life. This is an important read for all adults. An honest opinion from Sebold, helps us understand the process and aftermath of any rape victim. It's very pleasurable to read and I reccomend it.

Get it, you will not regret it
B00006CXSS|5.0|Word really cannot convey what I think of this masterpiece.  This is THE BEST film on World War II that I have seen to date and I have seen many.  The actors are perfectly casted -- all of them did a superb job in portraying the HEROES of Easy Company.  You can feel the ambiance of the 1940s, see what the men went through and be proud of the Greatest Generation ever!  Watching this film was a very humbling experience.  If you have never seen a war movie or have been deterred by watching any of them because of the violence, this is the one to see!  Yes, there is some violent scenes in this movie, but most of all, it is the amazing true story of the Heroes of Easy Company who fought one of the most important wars ever and it is important for us to remember and honor their sacrifice for our country.  If it were not for men like them, I can't imagine how we would have won World War II.  I am simply in awe of the Heroes from Easy Company and the Greatest Generation of men ever.  The documentary is also superb and best of all, you get to see the real life Heroes recollect their war experience.  I also recommend that you read the book by Steven Ambrose.  I give this movie and Steve Ambrose's book a FIVE STARS+  See it and get to know why the 1940s generation was the greatest.  Thank you Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for producing this superb film! Nobody could have done it better!
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Something's Gotta Give is one of the year's best films and best comedies as it teams up Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, who seemed to love every minute they shared onscreen. Nicholson plays a man who only dates girls under 30 and is shocked to find he can fall in love with a woman his own age, played by Diane Keaton, who has never looked better. She gives her best performance since she won an Oscar for Annie Hall and should be on her way to another as a very career sucessful woman who has no confidence with men. It is great to see her reaction to both Nicholson's and Keanu Reeves' character. Nicholson and Keaton light up the screen with every scene they are in and Amanada Peet and Reeves do very well in their supporting role, as does the underused Frances McDormand as Keaton's sister. Nancy Meyers, who had a huge hit with What Women Want, does a much better job here and makes for a great adult romantic comedy featuring actors over 50. A great film that will be remembered.
0792844882|5.0|I had the great pleasure of seeing this film on January 1, 2004, at our friends' annual New Year's Day party. What a combo to ring in 2004: the Rose Parade followed by Showgirls! From the first few moments, you realize you are in the presence of a &quot;masterpiece of bad,&quot; a category saved for the likes of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and a few other classics.  From a plot that is a mixture of Lifetime TV, soap opera, 42nd Street and Gypsy, to acting and writing that should drive any lover of film to question his entire belief system, not to mention the meaning of life, this classic misses the mark each and every time. . . thank goodness for that. And, from the DVD extra on the making of this film, you'd think you were watching Ingmar Bergman and his cast discussing Wild Strawberries. I urge you to rent or buy this film today, open a nice bottle of cheap chianti, order a pizza, and spend 2 hours and 11 minutes watching this. You'll realize that only in America could so much money be spent on something this bad without everyone involved being imprisoned or executed at dawn.  If that doesn't give us hope for the New Year, what will?
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This is the ultimate dvd for any Cher fan of any age. i also have had the privelege to see it live. This is the best show in the world. Many extravagant costumes and the best music. Any must have for a die-hard Cehr fan.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is truly fascinating from beginning to end and will leave you wishing it would just keep going indefinitely. It's so odd to see Jimmy Page answering questions in the interview at the end, having never heard him speak before! He's so shy and quiet that the 'rampaging Vikings' image gets a bit of a knock. Is it fun watching the band 'live' for four and a half hours? Yes, it is.  At the Albert Hall the performances are very strong, and there's a sense of the band still in a state of shock at the energy source that they have mysteriously tapped into. I think they look pretty silly after that, with Plant's absurd macho posturing, but the music is wonderful. It's interesting to see the change at Nebworth, two years after the full fury of Punk kicked in. Plant has toned his image down, making it more enjoyable to watch him, and Page plays it straight with no flares+dragons etc. In fact, the four of them each look as though they should be in different bands. But it was so great to see these performances, and sad that this was effectively the end. They are absolutely red-hot, with an amazing synchronisation between the drums and guitar on 'Achilles' Last Stand'. I can remember reading reviews of the Nebworth shows at the time, when Led Zeppelin were in the uncomfortable position of being one of Punk-rock's main targets. But with the benefit of hindsight, and thanks in part to this moving DVD, their musical brilliance can be properly appreciated.
B00006879E|5.0|Finally, a CD that I can listen to the whole way though without skipping only to the songs that have been given radio play.  I bought the cd because of the 1st single, decided to let it play all the way through, and honestly loved the whole thing.  I appreciate any band that is not banking on a couple of songs to sell their album, but instead makes an entire album that is as good as the singles released from it.  Two thumbs WAY up!!!
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Almost in spite of myself -- because I am really not much of a Quentin Tarantino fan -- I HIGHLY enjoyed this movie!  And one of the things I particularly liked about it was the marvelous soundtrack.<br />So, naturally, I rushed to buy it.<br />There are some incredible songs on this CD.  Nancy Sinatra's &quot;Bang Bang&quot; is so haunting that I keep singing it; &quot;The Grand Duel&quot; makes me just want to see the movie all over again, as does &quot;Run Fay Run&quot; (both of which are played in the anime sequence that cuts into the film, the background of Oren Ishii); &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; creeps me out deliciously; I love &quot;Green Hornet&quot;; &quot;Battle Without Honor or Humanity&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, and &quot;Crane/White Lightning&quot; are three of my favorites, though I almost wish that there WERE no words to &quot;Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; because it's so great with just the music!; &quot;Woo Hoo&quot; is funky and fun, even if it is a bit repetitive and strange; &quot;The Flower of Carnage&quot; is also wonderful, as is &quot;The Lonely Shepherd,&quot; both of which (especially the latter) really remind me a lot of the Japanese culture; and I'm glad they included the little excerpt, &quot;Ironside.&quot;<br />That's a lot of tracks to be impressed with.  However, there were also some disappointments.  I wish they had included a few MORE tracks, in particular the one (which I don't know the name of) where Oren Ishii first sees Uma Thurman in the restaurant -- in the movie, it cuts into &quot;Woo Hoo.&quot;  I was looking for that track!  It's got a great sound, and I wish they had included it.  There were a couple of the other tracks during the massive fight scene at the end that I wish they had included on this.<br />And as for a few of the other ones that they DID include...the most disappointing one was &quot;Ode to Oren Ishii.&quot;  I absolutely ADORED that particular music in the movie, and then theywent and superimposed this awful rap garbage over it, which in my opinion totally ruined it.  Ordinarily, I don't mind rap all that much, and sometimes I even enjoy it, but NOT when it interferes with something else I'm trying to listen to!  And this particular rap I thought was frankly lousy.<br />There are several extra tracks -- most of them under 10 seconds -- that are not actually included in the track listings on the back of the CD.  (Though I notice that amazon actually DOES list them all.)  I thought they were fairly unnecessary, but they don't really bother me too much, they mostly just seem superfluous and I think they should have taken that time used for those tracks and instead put something else there -- like that song where Oren first sees Uma.  ;-)<br />It should be noted, there IS a parental advisory on this soundtrack, and with good reason.  There are a couple of excerpts from the actual film, and the &quot;Queen of the Crime Council&quot; in particular is rather offensive and involves a nasty bit of language -- which personally I think is rather annoying for a soundtrack.  There are plenty of people who might enjoy this soundtrack, even if they WOULDN'T have enjoyed the movie, and this track might ensure that some people won't even buy the soundtrack.<br />Overall, I do enjoy this CD, in spite of its weaknesses.  The tracks I like more than make up for the tracks I do NOT like, and maybe some of the tracks I'm missing will appear on the second volume, who knows.  :-)  I would still recommend this as a good album to purchase -- just skip those tracks that don't appeal to you, and enjoy the rest of them.
0345413377|5.0|The Harry Potter books are way over-hyped. People seem to think that JK Rowling's cornered the market on good children's fiction. If all her faithful readers would just try something else, they would find that many other authors are capable of crafting rich, vibrant worlds suitable for young and old alike. I have had greater enjoyment reading His Dark Materials. <br />These books are certainly darker than usual Hogwarts fare, with mutilation, torture and death in plentiful supply. It also wrestles with complex concepts like religion and love (But bear in mind that we've been underestimating the ability of children to handle heavy issues for far too long). The characters are also far more complex than the staple gang of witches and wizards in training. Pullman's people refuse to be pigeonholed and display ever more intricate motivations and emotions.<br />The plot seems a little rushed, with Pullman scrambling to tie up all the loose ends. Scenes like the epic war with heaven that's been building up over the trilogy have been given short shrift. That said though, the book is a touching capstone to the odyssey of two children and displays incredible insights into growing up and the end of childhood innocence.
B00005JMCN|1.0|Animal abuse is the least of this movie's problems.  It's slow, boring, and overrated.  Basically, it's another silly movie with &quot;Oscar bait&quot; written on its face.  There's no substance.  Tobey Maguire was awesome in &quot;Spiderman,&quot; but he ain't working in this flick.  Skip this self-important turkey and rent &quot;Gigli&quot; instead.
0385504209|5.0|This book was a good read. It keeps you turning the pages until you finish it. It is provocative and raps many historical facts around its fast-pace. I won't give it away, but the ending is a little weird. Nonetheless, it's a fun read all the way through.

B00008DDSC|1.0|The mostly stellar reviews that this movie received, and my love of independent movies over summer blockbusters made this movie a must see on my list. When I started to watch this movie I immediately felt that it would be of those that would polarize its audience due to the subject matter and execution thereof, but I hoped that I would be on the side of those who liked it.<br />I was shocked only by how bored I was by watching this movie. The movie was marketed as a walk on the wildside of sorts and I kept waiting for it to get going. After watching half of it, I simply could not waste another minute.<br />The only positive thing that this movie accomplished was to allow Maggie Gyllenhaal the room to give a deeply immersed, credibly transitional performance as Lee, a fragile, frumpy, self-mutilating psychiatric patient recently released from a mental hospital. Her performance has to be considered a true breakthrough as she managed to give some humanity and believability to a heavy-handed yet underwritten script.<br />Other actors don't come out nearly as well. James Spader, who plays Lee's boss seems to be phoning in his performance as he is no different here than he is in the television show titled \\"The Practice\\". Spader's acting works very well in the series as he is part of an ensemble and his character has brought life to a series that was getting stale. Here he just annoys. Also, does the director not know that casting Leslie Ann Warren alsmost guarantees a dud. She unfortunately is an actress who like Spader seems to be playing the same angry victim every time she appears in a movie. This role may say a lot about the opportunities that are out there for mature women, but she does nothing to make it her own.<br />Although the director has a visual flair, the pacing of the movie killed it for me. The multiple scenes involving self-mutilation were treated frivolously and Lee's submission into the sadomasochistic relationship did not ring true to me. Although I like quirky movies, the repeated spankings seemed way out of place and the movie would have benefitted from a more restrained approach. I believe that it could have worked much better if it had taken the time to seduce the audience into seeing how Lee could be attracted by what was about to come. The execution could have benefited by creating a sense of mystery and not being so in your face with what seemed to be very violent spankings for the sake of being provocative.<br />Most will probably disagree with my views about this movie, but I owe my peers the courtesy of putting my two cents to balance the decisions of those who discover movies in this great site. Also, some may say that only seeing half the movie does not allow for a thorough review, but it got to the point when I was too bored and uninterested to watch. This is huge when you consider that I have only walked out of two movies in my whole life.<br />In a nutshell, this movie seems to be asking us to view the lead characters' kinkiness not as some innocuous behavioural difference but as a profoundly liberating statement. The statement is too bold and the movie in no way reaches the heights it intends too. Maybe this would work better as a documentary, but this film is a waste of time and money.ke quirky movies, the repeated spankings seemed way out of place and the movie would have benefitted from a more restrained approach.

B0000DZEE3|5.0|Now I've seen a lot of concerts and a lot of concert DVDs, but of all of the ones I own, the Peppers' Live at Slane is a perfect production from beginning to end, and doesn't give you a minute in it's hour-and-a-half span to calm down.<br />I'm not sure if this was stated in another review, but John Frusciante is arguably the star of the show. Don't get me wrong, Flea is at his normal peak of playing and performing, and Anthony and Chad do a perfect job, but the songs in the show are filled with the normal guitar hooks, but when it comes to the solos, John didn't fail to make me stare in awe. In songs like &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, you can even see the other members of the band smiling in John's direction, also awestruck with his skill. For the Flea fans, however, though he doesn't have as many crazy parts like in the previous DVD releases, there's always &quot;throw Away Your Television&quot;, not to mention a number of improv pieces.<br />They play in front of over 80,000 people, and don't let up for a second. My personal favorites include &quot;Around The World&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, and &quot;Venice Queen&quot;. You'll also be treated to their rendition of the Ramones' &quot;Havana Affair&quot;. Another great thing is the tunes they play in between songs, and the jams between Flea and John. One particular high for me was their halfway-cover of &quot;London Calling&quot;. You can also see Mr. Frusciante with a doo-wop song, somewhere within the few three songs. Also, the lines they play to open the show starts the show off right.<br />There aren't too many &quot;old-school&quot; Peppers songs, the older of which probably being from Blood Sugar, but the emotion they all put into their newer material proves they love what they're doing. It has the staples of the Peppers of the late 90's to today, with just about all of the singles, like &quot;By The Way&quot;, &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Under The Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Californication&quot;.<br />The mood of the show is incredible, as well. As the show goes on, you'll see the day quickly go from bright and sunny, to sunset, and to night, and the boys seem to play along with the atmosphere. The 18 song setlist is well worth the pricetag, but add in the unsurpassable performace (John's face during his solos, Anthony's always physical singing, and Flea kicking his feet and jumping around like a caffeine-filled kangaroo), and not to mention perfect video and sound quality, and you've got yourself one of the greatest concert DVDs ever. I've watched it about 4 or 5 times through, and I'm far from stopping. Thanks!

6304913176|1.0|Starship Troopers is the poster child of so many of Hollywood's sewage that it produces year after year after year.  In 1997, this film took the cake as a huge flop.  Despite harsh criticism I heard prior to seeing it, and the warnings of others, I went ahead and saw it.  I can see why some people think this is a good film: it's got all the carnal entertainment.  It has pretty boys and girls, one-liners, great special effects, tons of senseless gore, cuss words, and predictable plot elements.<br />Forget about a quality movie, with an awesome plot with likeable and original characters.  Nevermind storytelling, let's just cut to the action and have people's limbs sliced and diced with plenty of blood splashing on the camera lens.  Forgo intelligence, we just want guns and blood.  Let's not focus on great acting, let's make it a satire that's only funny if you have a hatred for the military and/or love morbid movies. This is probably the method behind the madness of this film in the mind of the sick director who created this.<br />What I have read from other reviewers is extremely disheartning.  My, how far have we come in the human race after all?  With reviewers who think this is a \\"fun\\" movie because people get ripped to shreds or a reviewer who thinks this is some kind of pop icon because it combines satire with a political message of anti-military, I would have to conclude that we've taken a step back in the long ladder of evolution or progression in being civil creatures.<br />You're probably wondering if I'm reviewing a film or preaching ethics.  Truth is, I've drawn a line and I was disappointed to find that most other reviewers did not draw a similar line as well.  It's not that hard to use your common sense while watching this movie and come to the immediate conclusion \\"gee, this really is a sick movie.\\"  Because it is, no doubt about it.<br />No you say?  So what do you call a film that's about a bunch of mindless bugs, scurrying about on a planet(s), breaking off asteroids and smashing cities on our planet?  What do you call a film where every minute is about somebody getting cut in half, beheaded, torn to shreds, stabbed, shot to pieces, burnt, and has their brains sucked out?  What the hell do you call that other than demented entertainment?<br />This film didn't try to create a realistic future, like Aliens or Blade Runner.  This film didn't try to tell a story of the troopers because most of them get killed off or there's so much blood and guts no development is attempted.  This film isn't even about the war with the bugs.  It's about morbid entertainment while dumbing you down with propaganda about the military which is extremely corny and perverse.<br />While watching this film, and watching all the fights with the troopers and bugs, a giant question kept filtering into my mind: where's the tanks?  Surely, the director must know that modern and I imagine future military infantry is escorted by a mechanized outfit.  But you can't have tanks in this film.  Why you ask?  Because the war wouldn't be much of a war, and there wouldn't be any troopers to get cut up.  You can't have tanks or else you have no gore, or in this case the extremity of gore.<br />In summary, the film's a waste of time.  If you have any kind of moral fiber, you'll walk away from this movie disturbed at how much useless violence and how horribly acted this film really was.  I suppose for some, cheap thrills and gore is all that matters in films.  For serious movie watchers who want a film to remember and cherish, Starship Troopers is the opposite of films we want.  I don't know, maybe I have high standards that Hollywood can't meet anymore because they're too concerned with their carnal entertainment because that's what gets people into the theaters.<br />Satire or no satire, this film tampers with death and horrindous killings and tries to make them either fun or cool.  It turns out, it just makes them corny and very disturbing because I frankly don't understand the director's blood thirst.  It makes me wonder if this director, who directed Robocop (surprise, surprise), is some sort of vampire or lover of blood because that's the impression I got from this film.<br />I'm not one that's against violence in films, only when it is excessive and brainless.  I can watch a film like Saving Private Ryan because it combines death and violence with drama and it has a point.  This film cuts people up as if they're onions or something, disregarding the drama in human life as if it has no meaning.<br />I don't recommend this movie, it's an awful and pitiful excuse of film making.  The acting is terrible and the gore is over done.  Not to mention everything is extremely cheesy and predictable.  I don't understand those who defend this film or those who continue to make it other than classify them with the old verse, \\"If it makes them smile, they'll consume it...even if its rotting their brain.\\"<br />Grade: F

With all of the reality tv (no offense to anyone who likes these shows) it was fantastic to finally have something worth watching AND on a Friday night. We had actually stopped hunting reruns and rewatching movies we own to watch Firefly. Do the people in charge ever listen? At least I have the DVD to watch on Friday's now.

B000089RVR|4.0|While looking over the \\"Best of the Year\\" Top 10<BR>lists from various music critics, I kept noticing<BR>\\"Life For Rent\\" by British singer Dido (Armstrong) showing up over and over again. In fact, one writer compared her voice to Dusty Springfield's, which immediately aroused my interest.<BR>Having seen it on the Billboard charts, I had been aware that the album was a million-selling hit, but never paid much attention to it previously. (I guess I had figured that Dido was another flavor-of-the-month pop star, who was destined to turn out a couple of Top 40 hits and then fade away.) But<BR>then I started to read all of the favorable reviews - and decided to investigate further. <BR>   Having now heard Dido's CD, I can  see why<BR>the critics like her. It's exactly what they always<BR>like - intimate, understated, warm, gentle music<BR>marked by subtlety and intelligence, from an<BR>unassuming  singer who doesn't indulge in histrionics<BR>or \\"over-singing\\".<BR>   Dido's voice is indeed reminiscent of Dusty<BR>Springfield (it has some of that same \\"husky\\"<BR>quality), but she's no candidate for operatic stardom.<BR>She doesn't have the \\"big voice\\" of many contemporary pop divas and glamour queens, and can't belt out power ballads or pile on the melismas like they do. But she doesn't appear to have<BR>any desire to do that anyway.<BR>  I think some fans of the  Norah Jones/Melissa Errico<BR>school of adult-contemporary music will like \\"Life For<BR>Rent\\". To be sure, the style is different. The album<BR>has a modern, synthesizer-assisted \\"electronic\\" sound, and Dido's musical background is evidently in the  contemporary<BR>folk singer/songwriter genre rather than jazz and pop-standard music. But the intimate quality and understated style of performance are the same. As critic Elysa Gardner wrote in USA Today, Dido's \\"cool grace is the ideal balm for top 40-chafed ears\\". In other words, a breath of fresh air!
0375432302|1.0|.<br />Remember Cliff from Cheers - the guy who spouted off a number of obscure facts and tried to establish a hypothesis from them?... how the ancient Greeks, for example, invented the toilet roll by trying to make scrolls pocket-sized...;-) That is what this book reminds me of...<br />Perhaps that's unfair... Cliff could have written a better book.<br />I like what someone said earlier, Brown is really a writer for Scooby Doo cartoons!  It has all the makings of the same plot.<br />The 'mysteries' are disappointing grade school material (apple?, come on!) and the 'experts' are pure schlock... Brown's own characters were embarrassed by the 'scientific' explanations and his 'hack' of other peoples work and agendas.  Even the most far-fetched theories are immediately accepted as fact, because they are so ridiculous... (Gasp! I guess they MUST be true).  Great technique, have your own characters scoff or say they were 'originally skeptic' -- I guess that gives it 'academic' credibility... (not)<br />And secret societies... mysterious albino giant?  escaped from prison because of an earthquake?  Age of Aquarius?  Is it any surprise that Brown is smirking on the cover photo... maybe Leonardo was trying to warn people from buying the book when he is quoted... 'awake mere mortals from the deception' (or some such dribble).  That is a more plausible message from the past than what Brown is spouting.<br />This is an obvious attempt by Brown to submit an idea for a movie.  It has all the substance of a hour and a half 'B-thriller'.  Hopefully, any prospective studios will read these reviews and see what a waste of time this would be on the screen...<br />Unless, of course, it starred Cliff as Langdon and Scooby Doo as his sidekick... then you'd have something...
B00008H2LB|3.0|Ok, let's start by saying I am and will always be a big Linkin Park fan. When I first bought Meteora, I listened to the tracks from top to bottom without skipping any (Believe me, I hardly ever do that). At first, the CD was great! But after a while, after listening to the CD over and over again, the words of the songs start to sink in and you just realise that they are just basically repeating the same words, the same message over over and again from song to song, that is, &quot;Some person hurt them or took advantage of them and they have to get back at that person.&quot; Come on LP, we got your message the first time around in Hybrid Theory!! In a nutshell, the majority of the songs, with the exception of the hit &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot;, are just the same words of anger and bitterness but differently arranged and masked behind a catchy beat. I don't regret buying Meteora since I like most of the songs. But I soon got a bit bored of hearing the same message and their constant rage and bitterness repeated in every song. If you are a devout LP fan, by all means, buy it! But if you like originality and get bored of things quickly, try something else.
B00005AR3G|5.0|Don't be stupid and waste your time reading this and just buy this movie. by far my favorite and funniest movie made by disney to date. I've seen it many times and it just keeps getting better. Whoever gave this movie a 3-star review was just using big words and trying to sound smart, so don't listen. This movie isn't a &quot;oh one line was funny&quot; movie, it's a &quot;My god I can't remember all the times I was laughing movie&quot;. I won't explain the plot because you should have already bought it by now and you'll be seeing it soon. what makes this so great is the fact that all the scenes are funny and get funnier as the movie goes on (last scene will stick in your head for a long time). If none of this has made since to you, it's because it's hard the write well when you're still laughing...
B000065V1V|5.0|While I have been impressed and inspired by Bowie for years, I have to admit that I can't truly consider myself a *huge* fan because I only have several of his albums - most being from the last ten years (_Outside_, _Earthling_, _Reality_, etc.).  His work from the 60s, 70s, and 80s I know primarily from a best-of collection, radio, and MTV/VH1.  That said, _Heathen_ blew me away when I first heard it.<br />I can't think of another artist that has been around as long as Bowie that keeps writing and recording new material that sounds fresh, energetic, and urgent.  _Heathen_ contains some chilling songs - songs that are so emotional and hit you in such a place inside that you have to listen to them over and over again.  When he sings: &quot;There's fear overhead, there's fear overground...&quot; and &quot;But who are we/So small in times such as these,&quot; one cannot help but think that these lyrics relate to 9/11.  However, Bowie has stated that the material for _Heathen_ was written before 9/11 - which actually makes the lyrics throughout the album even more bonechilling.  On &quot;Better Future&quot; he sings: &quot;Please don't tear this world asunder/Please take back this fear we're under/I demand a better future.&quot;  There are beautiful lyrics like these throughout _Heathen_, as well as very good covers of &quot;Cactus&quot; and Neil Young's &quot;I've Been Waiting For You.&quot;  My favorite song on the album is &quot;Everyone Says 'Hi'&quot; - just about as perfect as a little pop song can get.  With a simple arrangement, the song is a beautiful sentiment with the line that we should all make it a point to remember: &quot;Don't stay in a sad place where they don't care how you are.&quot;<br />Listening to this album made me really wonder if any other artist in their 40s and 50s has remained as artistically satisfying as Bowie continues to prove he is.  Bowie has not softened with age and each song has the feeling that he is out to prove something.  Many artists lose this feeling as they get older and begin to coast on proven formulas (Sting immediately comes to mind).  Pick this album up!

0375823360|5.0|Pullman has written a series to rival both his predecessors and his contemporaries. His symbolism, character evolution and ideologies are wrapped up in a drama that attracts both the young and the young at heart.  <br />This book was recommended to me by a man in his 40s (I am in my 30s). When I saw &quot;teen&quot; written on the box, I started to worry that I would be reading other Harry Potter - entertaining and engaging, but without tremendous moral or philosophical depth. (Please don't get me wrong - I'll be first in line for the next HP installment.) As a lifetime SF/fantasy junkie, I still needed a fix. That fix led to a marathon reading of all three books over the Christmas holidays.  <br />Good and evil, right and wrong, love and duty, are all interwoven with references to theology, physics, mythology that many readers will perhaps not grasp until their university years or later.  Pullman creates a world where black and white merge into all shades of grey, one where villain and hero are not as clear-cut as they may seem.  Without revealing the ending, it is one that is both heart wrenching, yet morally true to Pullman's reluctance for absolutes.  <br />While you may not agree with it, HDM presents extremely interesting, even controversial viewpoints on our own tiny universe.  But never forget that speculative fiction serves to expand the mind and Pullman does not disappoint. I am proud to display His Dark Materials in my library next to books from treasured authors and modern-day literati.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|My title is a cliche but in this case it's the only phrase to use.  The version of this movie available now, with its extra disc full of great bonus material, is an example of how to bring DVD format to its highest potential.  First of course there's the movie, and its director Sergio Leone.  Every Leone movie I've seen--Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good Bad and Ugly, Once Upon a Time in America--is wonderful, but this tops them all.  Imagine the year 1969: what a great time to be a western film lover.  You had this, and Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch in the same year.  Incredible.  Anyway, it's impossible to list all the great scenes, so I'll stick with the first.  If you love the credit sequence you'll love the movie; it's not for everybody, however.  So those credits, mostly silent except for a windmill creaking, which Leone somehow makes sinister, and one of the minimal details he uses to establish authentic mood, are the litmus test.  You'll either love the movie or hate it.  The scene is built on a genius contradiction: it's so tense that you want it to end, but it's so beautifully done, so built on image and gesture and glance, that you also hope it never ends.  The whole movie is that delicious.  And the cast--wow.  Everyone is at top form, but check out Henry Fonda as the leanest meanest bastard imaginable, but also someone you can't avoid enjoying because it is the GREAT Mr. Fonda, with Leone getting maximum mileage out of close ups of Fonda's ice-blue eyes, as unforgiving as a western sky, generally acting like the amiable stalwart figure he always plays, until he shoots little kids and fat lackeys whom he doesn't trust because they wear both suspenders and belts: and as Fonda says, how can you trust a man who can't even trust his own pants?  As the heroine, Claudia Cardinale isn't just gorgeous she's luscious, lust-us.  And tough.  Watch for the scene where she looks at herself in the mirror when she's all alone in her house. whose previous residents, her family, have been killed by Fonda and his thugs.  Charles Bronson--what an underrated actor.  Dangerous yet entirely sympathetic here.  He finds wit in his role, knows exactly what the unique Leone's up to and gets in sync with the vision.  Jason Robards is incapable of giving a performance less than brilliant, and this is another highlight in the film.  As Cheyenne he is funny and tough and smart, maybe the most complex performance in the movie.  There's so much more, too--the finest Ennio Morricone soundtrack, killer dialogue, extraordinary cinematography.  This DVD is put together so well it's even a pleasure to look at the menus--you'll see what I mean.  And all this for under FIFTEEN U.S. DOLLARS.  What are you waiting for?
B00004U2G1|2.0|I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers was excellent (in my opinion, best movie of 2002). With the quality of movie-making behind this franchise, it's no small surprise the stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor is outstanding. Many people agree that specific cut scenes were absolutely vital to giving certain characters more depth and I applaud Peter Jackson for putting on, what, 43 more minutes? If you haven't read the books, then the extended version is what you need. I guess for pacing and time constraints, they cut what they needed to, but on DVD, neither of these things hamper the original cut. Also, I'm not aware of another movie franchise that puts so much extra/special features onto their DVDs (maybe because so much went into making the movies). They are great fun to watch (well--most of them anyway) because they aren't just thrown together for marketing like so many other movies do. I highly recommend the Extended Edition of the Two Towers.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is a concept album: the concept of fencing creativity in the realms of pure metal (though still 'progressive'). You wouldn't always eat caviar and salmon, sometimes you need to get a burger. This is a spicy-burger-album.<br />There is nothing that catches you immediately, except for the brutal sound, all earlier pathos gone. But give it some more runs! There is a hidden beauty to it. There are indeed some musical phrases that creep around in my head now, after I dismissed the album already.<br />Nonetheless, there are some flaws. Just like the sound, the composition is rawer and appears not as carefully designed as in earlier albums. Simpler melody lines, simpler chord progressions, acceptable considering the pure metal approach. May it be intentional - sometimes there are plain beadings of incoherent parts in a song, just to make it lengthy? Disturbingly spiritless, these parts. Fade that out mentally and you have a good album.<br />I can't keep my mouth shut: Some reviewers here complain about Jordan Rudess missing in the sound. Some seem to be unable to distinguish between a guitar-like synth sound and a guitar :) He wrote most of the songs. Some throw a &quot;NU METAL!!!&quot; at the album just like an invective (do you really think DT sounds like Korn, Limp Bizkit, POD or whatever the protagonists may be?). Face it, it's the sound du jour. 'Progressive' may be hard to define, but it's certainly NOT defined as &quot;sticking to the sound of ancient times&quot;. I rather think the old DT sound was slightly outdated, now it's up to date.
0385504209|3.0|I agree that this book is chalk full of great little tidbits of historical info and teasers, as well as some controversal ones (both fact and fiction) however it's definitely not a well written piece (as far as the form of writing goes). But it is definitely a page turner.  It's almost written as a screenplay and I'm sure they had their sights on a movie deal shortly after. As many people have mentioned, the plot devices can be seen coming a mile away and the writing style doesn't help to improve it much. It is, still, a page turner with suspense/murder/cryptology/conspiracy theories/art history/secret societies and of course the Catholic Church.<br />The main characters are the vehicle for the reader to learn all this great info--and little more. They don't really have much depth themselves. I believe this is coming out in paperback soon, so if you've held off long enough from buying this, I would wait to get it in paperback.<br />I'm sure you could also just wait for the movie too (maybe next fall?).
0385504209|5.0|When I first laid my eyes on the Davinci Code I had my doubts.  I wasn't interested in reading a book in the adult category.  I'm only 14 after all.  When I started reading it though, I literally couldn't put it down.  There was adventure, mystery, riddles, interesting facts and even romance.  I was stunned that an author could actually put all of that into one book and make it work. The Davinci Code most importantly, raised questions that before I didn't bother thinking about.  I know that I couldn't possibly know if the questions raised were valid or correct.  All I know is that the book caused people to look at new options and ideas, even when their religion compelled them not to.  If a book can accomplish that, cause people to think about explanations they had just taken for granted, then that book is really something.  It's up to the readers to think what that something is.  So I thank Dan Brown for a new perspective, a fresh way of thinking.
B000001A3H|5.0|First, most all the guitar riffs on &quot;Blues For The Red Sun&quot; are very Sabbath, no doubt about it.  However, for people like me who think that Ozzy's voice ruined Black Sabbath and don't like to buy music that was made before the 80's, Kyuss is a perfect stoner rock album to start with.  Fans of Danzig and old Metallica will be in heaven when they listen to this one.<BR>The first five tracks on &quot;Blues For The Red Sun&quot; are the most energetic; they have monster grooves backed by a fierce punk energy.  &quot;Thumb&quot; and &quot;Green Machine&quot; establish a pace that allows Kyuss to smoothly transition into druggy, epic sounding songs.  &quot;Molten Song&quot; and &quot;50 Million Year Trip&quot; are like the after effects of an overwhelming rush that leaves a person in a daze.  &quot;Thong Song&quot; is like coming back to a reality with a blast of euphoric energy.  The first 5 tracks remind me of the song &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; by Metallica where they go off into a druggy episode right in the middle.<BR>For some reason, Kyuss' sound matches the feeling of the desert so well, but I can't put my finger on exactly what is.  The second half of the album makes you feel is if you were sitting in a shady spot in the middle of a blistering hot desert.  No place to go, but no worries either.<BR>&quot;Blues For The Red Sun&quot; could've been a major mainstream hit and I'm glad it wasn't.  In '92 the music industry was turned on its head by the breakout of grunge and this one somehow overlooked (thank god).  The album would be right in home on a classic rock radio station, but that will never happen.
B00006IUL7|4.0|The film certainly bears its name well because the last thing you'll want to do while watching it is to fall asleep.  In fact, the tension runs so high that even after the credits roll by, the last thing you'll be thinking about is your bed.  Most likely, what you will be doing is trying to remember the last time you saw a thriller this good, this exciting and this effective at putting you inside the uncomfortable position of its main character.  Christopher Nolan's follow-up to the fantastic MEMENTO is as tight a production as they come, featuring three Academy Award winners, an out-of-sight landscape, and a story that will tingle and scrape at more of you nerve endings than a visit to a bad dentist.<br />Pacino and Hilary Swank display tremendous chemistry as the veteran cop and the youngster who admires him, pairing up to solve both the initial murder and another more mysterious crime that comes along and blows the case wide open.  Thankfully, Pacino plays a more subdued character than his usually more agitated self and as for Swank, it was nice to see her with some meat on her bones, looking good and putting up a great performance.  Whilst I hardly consider myself a fan of Robin Williams, even I have to say that he was perfect as an offbeat author from a neighboring town.  It's a very character and plot driven movie and these three drove it home in style. The surrounding cast also followed their lead in playing the local cops and townspeople, with a special nod going to the delightful Maura Tierney who plays the town hotelier.<br />It was pretty cool to see Pacino in this setting. We're not used to seeing him in a small town with snow and grass since he's usually playing characters in New York or LA.  which was another northern murder mystery featuring cops dealing in environments in which they were not familiar.  It was actually quite refreshing and very satisfying to see this perspective on Pacino. Overall, the film is definitely worth the look and a great useof a couple of hours as solid entertainment and lots of gritting of teeth. A success through and through
B00005JM02|5.0|I absolutely almost always hate animated movies, but every so often one will catch my eye (Shrek and now Nemo) and I'll have to watch. I must say...hats off to the Disney and Pixar studios who put this one together because you did a fantastic job! This film is filled with lovable characters (the turtles, Dory, Marlin, Bruce, and of course Nemo) and witty dialogue that is great for all ages. The plot keeps us strumming along as we follow an uptight and very nervous father on his journey with the hilarious Dory on their search for a little clown fish named Nemo. Highly enjoyable and great fun for the whole family!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Oh yes, this sprawling 9 disc set covers just about anything and everything about the ALIEN series and a must for any serious fan of the movies. A theatrical and an alternate version (with extended and deleted scenes, especially with the second, third and fourth movies) of the four films are included. Commentary from the director, film crew and cast members are included on the alternate audio tracks. Each film have a separate disc chock full of background materials. A ninth disc contain even more supplementary materials for the first film, and trailers and promos for the other three.<br />ALIEN - The very first one remain my personal favorite. While it seems many fans prefer the sequel, one should be reminded there wouldn't be a sequel without the groundbreaking and often imitated but never surpassed original. The Director's Cut of ALIEN have some new scenes in it (Lambert plotting the course to the planetoid, Lambert slapping Ripey, the cocooned sequence), but there were other cuts in the film so in end it was a couple of minutes shorter than the original.<br />The cast and crew commentary and the background materials on ALIEN was everything a fan could hope for, almost everybody was involved: Ridley Scott, all the cast member (yes, even Sigourney Weaver) except Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto, Jerry Goldsmith, and even the reclusive HR Giger (who seems to be morphing into the likeness of his work).<br />Material from the Laserdisc release of ALIEN was also included, which made for a fascinating read when it comes into the genesis of the script and the structure of the film, inlcuding pages from O'Bannon's original screenplay which featured 6 male crew members.<br />Many of the background featurettes include alternate shots and other footages of the film never seen before (the alien's tail about to stab Brett's back, Kane actually being hauled into the ship, Veronica Cartwright falling on her butt after being sprayed with \\"blood\\", actor Jon Finch as Kane before being replaced by John Hurt). There are even more alternate deleted and extended scenes not included in ALIEN's 25th anniversary DvD release. <br />The 25th anniverary release have two alternate audio tracks which featured Goldsmith's original entire score for the film, but it is not included here.<br />ALIENS - Although I like this film a lot, ultimately, the stereotypical gung-ho attitude and over the top performance of the actors who portrayed the ill fated space marines made ALIENS a bit uncomfortable to watch at times. In any case, there is no comparing ALIENS and its predecessor: both films are in completely different genres. ALIEN is a masterpiece in suspense and horror while ALIENS is a wild shoot 'em up action flick. <br />Once again, the deleted scenes added depth and scope to the film. However, the scene where Ripley discovered a cocooned Burke was not included in the film, or anywhere else in the extras, which was a disappointment.<br />ALIEN 3- I particularly dislike this film because it made everything that happened in ALIENS totally pointless. ALIEN3 is also a bit famous (or infamous) for the epic battles that David Fincher supposedly fought with the Powers That Be at FOX. The liner notes did some attempt at damage control; but the fact that Fincher did not participate in the release (the only director from the 4 films to do so), and other reviewers' opinions to the contrary of what the liner notes claimed, one can argued that ALIEN3 WAS an artistically compromise project. Of the four films, ALIEN3 has the most in terms of extended scenes. But extended or not, the deaths of Newt, Hicks, the android Bishop and Ripley made ALIEN3 a rather depressing film to watch....and you'd think in the future, there would be an Asian who can speak unaccented English!<br />ALIEN RESURRECTION: A slight improvement over ALIEN3, by the time this film came along, we have known too much about the Aliens already and are no longer afraid of them. So we end up with a particularly nauseating monster made from the genes of humans and Aliens (which met an equally nauseating end). The extended version has a totally different title sequence that was almost comedic, and alternate ending had Ripley #8 and Call on Earth (won't spoil you on where they landed).<br />Speaking of Call, Winona Ryder was totally miscasted as the dimunitive tough talking android.<br />In any case, this collection has basically almost everything you want to know about the Alien series. The bonus material on the first two films are worth the price themselves. The extended scenes on the last two films made them better and improves on them.<br />BTW, the original ALIEN's running time was close to 3 to 4 hours. I wonder if THAT would be released for its 40th anniversary.
B000005J56|5.0|This is an instant classic. I remember back in 1997 when these gentlemen (and woman) created quite a stir and wound up winning a Grammy for this fine piece of artistry. Unforgettable performances by Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer, Eliades Ochoa, <BR>Barabarito Torres, Omara Portuondo, Ruben Gonzalez and Ry Cooder himself makes this CD a collector's item. One of the best CD's of all times, (well for me anyway). Strongly Recommended.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|I enjoyed the movie so much on so many different levels I had (and am still having) a tough time figuring out what I wanted to say.  I won't try to get too eloquent or elaborate and I'll try to keep things simple.The film, as many Cameron Crowe films are, is about many things.  On the surface it's about music and love, but dig deeper and you'll find so much more. I originally thought that I enjoyed the film so much because as a pseudo-journalist myself, I could relate to a lot of the issues as a film.  But really, this is a film that everyone can relate to. If it's not one thing, it's another. Kate Hudson does a terrific job of playing the &quot;one who got away&quot; - the first love that everyone's got and everyone thinks back to over a warm beer on a boring day.  Frances McDormand was robbed of an Oscar for her role as the loving yet overprotective mother who only wants her kids to grow up right but has them both leaving home at early ages. The scene where she's one the phone with William in the kitchen and after he hangs up she throws the phone to the floor is classic.  In fact, there are so many scenes in this movie that are classic - Penny Lane dancing to Cat Stevens in an empty concert hall; a late night conversation between William and Lester Bangs about the perils of being &quot;uncool&quot;; William revealing to Penny how she was &quot;traded&quot; from Stillwater to another band I could go on and on, but I'll spare you.
B00005JMCW|4.0|I watched this the other night and literally fell out of my chair from laughing. Although the entire movie is not always hilarious...the whole thing is sugar-coated which makes for a sweet delight to those just wanting a good 'ole family flick. Lindsey Lohan is awesome and absolutely the best in the movie. Watch it for the laughs and pure enjoyment.
B000092ZYY|4.0|Okay, people, listen up. Anyone reviewing this album and telling others to go buy Justin or Britney is definately missing the point. This isn't a dance album! Beck's &quot;Midnight Vultures&quot; (the songwriter's 180 degree turn from hard-rockers and loser-anthems) is more dance than this. Electronic sounds do not instantly imply dance. I've never heard Justin rock like this (scrath that... period), and I've never heard such an ambiguous or insightful lyric come from the mouth of Britney (even if by chance it did, she didn't write it).<br />Anyone telling others to go buy [enter nu-metal or emo band here] is also missing the point. This isn't nu-metal or emo-rock! Radiohead doesn't push it over the edge emotionally like so many bands do today. (Picture some kid with hair over his eyes, a bottle of beer, crying into a microphone. Or some guy trying to prove how angst-ridden he is by turning the distortion up as high as it goes and screaming as loud as he can.) Anyone complaining about the &quot;downer&quot; aspect of this album is obviously completely unfamiliar with the band because that's what Thom Yorke is.<br />Finally, to the old-school art rockers who think that nothing truly creative has come out since Pink Floyd or King Crimson, I must retort that making music sounding exactly like the 60's or 70's wouldn't be very creative now would it? Granted, the market is is very against anyone who doesn't fall into the status quo, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And Radiohead is one of the few bands that have managed to break through that philosophy. Because even as Coldplay and Travis start to do it, Radiohead is ahead of the game, evolved again into something different.<br />Anyway, just wanted to clear up anyone bashing this band/CD by comparison to others. Because really there is none.
B00008YLV2|5.0|I was reading some of the one-star reviews and i came across a great number of reviews claiming that the movie portrays the Somalians as &quot;maniacal, inhuman, the bad guys&quot;. i highly disagree.<br />For one thing, although unmentioned in the movie but instead in the included documentary of the excellent 3 disc deluxe edition, the militia in somalia chew a type of drug called &quot;cot&quot; that makes them highly aggressive and violent on a daily basis. The &quot;angry shouting Somalians&quot; were most likely just that when they fought the americans in 1993; angry and shouting. <br />When i finished viewing the movie, i was surprised to see the stark difference in american casualties and somalian casualties, but the movie did not leave me with the feeling that the somalians were a group of heartless monsters. Instead, there were many instances in the movie which showed the human aspect of the indigenous people (for instance, there is a very painful scene involving a child soldier), and it amazes me as to how these people go off and just ignore these sequences. There really is nothing that is blatantly propaganda-like in this movie, at least in terms of portraying the indigenous people who suffered the most. <br />In fact, i thought the movie was portraying the AMERICANS as the bad guy of the event, as the &quot;interveners&quot; of a domestic affair. But the film does state the histoical reason as to why the americans were there in the first place: the &quot;starvation&quot; tactic used by Warlord Aidid in the civil war had claimed the lives of 300,000 somalian civilians. WHen the UN sent aid, Aidid forcefully took control of the major cities/harbors and claimed all the food aid for himself, giving no food to the neighboring, opposing, starving factions whose people were dying. 20,000 marines and a UN army were able gain control of the cities and distribute the food to those who needed it, but once the marines left somalia Aidid took control right back. TheRangers and Delta Force Units were sent to find and stop Aidid so that food could be fairly distributed. And this is smeared off as &quot;Unnecessary American Intervention, causing 10,000 somali deaths&quot;. A little off topic here, but it truly makes me mad to hear these people shout &quot;Unnecessary American Intervention&quot; when they would be shouting about how America was greedy and selfish had THEY NOT intervened. I can envision a whole crowd of college students claiming how hundreds of thousands in somalia starve while the US gov't is busy building up its arms for the war on iraq. If you actually cared about these people, you wouldve noticed the 300,000 dead from a stravation tactic used by a ruthless warlord. so please, shut your anti-american rants, please.<br />Its true, this movie DOES get very confusing with the large cast and many events going on. and it does not really have a &quot;plot&quot;. all of these are sacrificed for an authentic feeling to the event. i would recommend watching this movie 2 or 3 times to get a good understanding of everything that happens, and to put the subtitles on so that the names of the characters are more recognizeable. While the gore and confusion may seem overwhelming at first, this movie is a real inspriring gem if you give it the chance to be seen a few times. <br />Oh, and the last thing this is, is &quot;Bloody gory entertainment&quot;. that never was the intention of the makers. if you want bloody gory entertainment, go watch something like &quot;ichi the killer&quot;
B00006G8G4|5.0|I'm a long time fan of the Spider-Man comics, so I went into this film with cautious optimism. I'd been burned by comic movies many times before. I'm pleased to say I wasn't disappointed. This was an excellent adaptation of the comics! In fact, I'd say this is one of the best comic movies ever made. I personally feel it's in the class of the first Superman and Batman movies. I loved the X-Men movie, but I think Spider-Man surpassed it. I'm so happy they got it right. They got the perfect mixture of romance, action, humor, and drama in the film. It's a rare thing to see it all come together so well, but they pulled it off. You feel like you're a friend of Peter Parker's and you're following him on this incredible journey.<br />I had several favorite scenes. The first of which was when he first discovered his powers. There's like a 20-minute stretch where you're just laughing and amazed at the same time. As he discovered his power to stick to things and shoot webs, it's really hilarious. His confrontation with Flash is fun and cool. There's nothing better than seeing the geek triumph. And Peter's first attempts to actually shoot a web and swing on it were classic. &quot;Up, up, and away, web! Shazam!!&quot; I know some people hate the organic web shooters, but I think they turned out perfect in the film. It was a good move to change it from the comic and it not only added some funny moments, but it made Spider-Man more like a spider.<br />Another awesome scene is when Peter pursues the burglar in the movie. If you've read the comics, you know what an emotional moment this is. It's even more powerful and exciting on the big screen. When this happens, Peter has yet to perfect his powers. As he tries to chase down a car, he stumbles, fumbles, and almost gets killed multiple times. He's not yet the graceful superhero that he eventually becomes. But his anger, determination, and thirst for revenge drive him, and it makes the chase all the more desperate. It's one of the best action scenes ever in a comic movie. By the time it's over, you really understand his motivations for becoming a superhero.<br />My third favorite scene is the final battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. It's a brutal knock down, drag out fight that is very impressive. While Spider-Man has been a dominant force throughout the film, he pretty much has his backside handed to him by the Green Goblin. It's his first real fight for simple survival, and it really feels like it. And the ending is faithful to the comics, too. It really sets things up for the sequel.<br />What sets Spider-Man apart from bad comic movies is the characterization. For every action scene, there are two scenes of simple conversation between characters. Sam Raimi goes to great pains to make you care for ALL of the characters before he gets into the action. You feel sorry for Peter when he's picked on. You sympathize with Mary Jane's as she goes from one abusive relationship to another. You understand the tension and love between Harry and his father Norman. You really care for Aunt May and Uncle Ben. So when these extraordinary events start taking place, you have an emotional attachment to the characters. You really feel what they feel.<br />Tobey Maguire is a great Peter Parker. He's shy and geeky in school, yet smart-mouthed and confident as Spider-Man. He was a questionable choice early on when casting the role, but he really proved himself. Kirsten Dunst is great as the girl next door. Just like the comic character, her happy exterior hides an unhappy soul. Dunst makes it easy to see why she'd start feeling attracted to Peter. Willem Dafoe was a perfect Green Goblin. Then again, he's always been good at playing psychos. Dafoe is successful at making the Green Goblin both evil and sympathetic at the same time. He also dances along the line of being over-the-top without ever quite going over it like a lot of the Batman villains did. Finally, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is absolutely hilarious. He's actually the one that goes over-the-top and it's perfect. He's cheap, rude, and a loudmouth. You can't ask for anything more.<br />Overall, Spider-Man is a wonderful moviegoing experience for people who love the comic and those who have no idea what &quot;Excelsior!&quot; means. Oh, and watch for cameos by Xena's Lucy Lawless as a punk rocker, Stan Lee saving a little girl, Bruce Campbell as the ring<BR>announcer, and more.have to echo some of the gripes of other people who have reviewed this movie. The first is the soundtrack by Danny Elfman. The music is pretty good for this film, but there is no definitive Spider-Man theme. Batman had a great one. Superman had a fantastic one. Spider-Man got nothing. The music is rather unmemorable. I hate saying this in light of the fact that I generally love Elfman's work.<br />My second gripe is the effects. They ranged from jaw-droppingly amazing to very, very fake. I thought the effects worked best when the camera was either sitting still or moving slowly. It was times like that which you could appreciate the gracefulness of Spidey and what he was doing. The rest of the time the camera was moving, twisting, and turning so wildly that it was hard to figure out what was happening. It made for more dynamic scenes, but all you could see was a blue and red blur wiggling on the screen. If it's between decent effects or a great story, I'd take the great story. But it would be nice to have both.<br />My final complaint is that the movie felt like it skipped a beat in the middle. Peter goes from graduating from high school and being semi-competent with his powers to being a full-fledged superhero in New York. The only thing that bridges the two is a montage of scenes where New Yorkers talk about Spidey's exploits and we see flashes of him in action. It's fun, but it felt like something was missing. I wanted to see more scenes of Spidey fighting crime. I suppose it had to be shortened in the interest of time, butI would have liked to have seen more.<br />'Nuff said.
B000099T2L|2.0|I wanted to give this album 2 and a half, but since that isnt possible, I only gave it 2.<br />When I heard &quot;Crazy in love&quot; I knew the album had to be tight, boy was I wrong. THIS CD IS SO BORING! The only good songs on here are &quot;Crazy in love&quot;, &quot;Baby boy&quot;, &quot;Me, myself and I&quot; and &quot;Be with you&quot;. This album has to many slow songs. I like slow songs, but the ones on Beyonce's album are boring. <br />I have tried to listen to this album over and over to see if my mind would change, but it hasnt.<BR> THIS IS THE MOST OVERRATED CD OF THE YEAR!<BR>I am so glad i bought this cd on the street for $4, instead of paying $18 for it. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME B!
0064407667|5.0|Dear less than fortunate book reader,<br />If you are reading this review under your own free will, please stop immediately. Alternatively, if you are reading this because someone has threatened to make you eat various flavors of oddly shaped candy if you don't read this, it is even more urgent that you stop. It would be much more pleasant to read a book about horses, or maybe The Littlest Elf.<br />I will ask you to pay no attention to the five-star rating I must have given this book when I was not thinking. While the thirteen chapters of The Bad Beginning may be printed on nice paper and be grammatically correct, the story it tells of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire is quite unpleasant.<br />Why, just last evening, I overheard a gentleman, whose name I do not recall, call The Bad Beginning, \\"A wonderful book about three orphans and the evil Count Olaf, who schemes to steal the fortune their parents left behind. But the three children stick together through it all and always find a solution to any trouble that Olaf sends their direction.\\" Even worse than the gentleman whose name I do not recall, was the lady I overheard whose name I recall less who said,  \\"The Bad Beginning is a book that people of all ages may enjoy, and takes a refreshing new approach for being funny.\\"<br />Please, I beg you, do not make the same mistake that children and adults of all ages have made, who seemed to think that this was one of the best books they ever read, by looking at this book further. I urge you to turn off your computer this instant and get as far away from it as possible.<br />With all due respect,<BR>Michael Strickland

B00004KD11|5.0|All I have been listening to for the last week is the song &quot;Hush&quot; by Deep Purple.  I first heard it on one of the Music Choice channels offered by our local cable company.  When I first heard it, I thought: &quot;This is Deep Purple?&quot;  The music sounded 360 degrees different from their later major hit &quot;Smoke On The Water&quot;.  Wow!  This one song alone is so great...I am really hoping the rest of the album follows suit (have not purchased the album yet).  &quot;Hush&quot; is so psychedelic and ahead of its time....no wonder it's a classic!  This is a definite must-have for any respectable CD collection....and don't worry...I will be buying my copy soon (as I can find one)!
B000006NXP|5.0|Lately, the more I listen to this recording, the better it gets (or rather, my appreciation of it grows...the CD remains the same); but, as I said in the title of this review, I initially thought it missed something or other (despite my trying to define 'what exactly', I couldn't place my finger on it). Maybe it was subconscious doubt as to whether a better Brahms 4th could be found.<br />Now I do not search very hard for a substitute: you may have gathered that I've grown very fond indeed of this CD.<br />Anyway, I penned this down because I thought people might run into a similar situation like mine; and in my vanity I also hoped one additional positive Amazon Reviewer might switch people's minds in such a way so that they give this CD a shot, or a second evaluation.<br />Now I think it should get a respected place in any collection of classical music.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I received the DVD for Christmas, and it brought back all of the sadness we felt over the cancellation of this outstanding program. To know that the requiem music composed for the funeral scene was also a &quot;goodbye&quot; to the show made it nearly unbearable to hear. So much love was poured into this project--so much of the heart and soul of every person involved in its creation. Then it got pooped on by the network. I will never understand what Fox was thinking. This show was never given a fair chance.

B00005J6SZ|1.0|It's bad enough if you like Madonna. But this cd is OLD Madonna songs, remastered. Let me just say that those who still cling to old music truly suck, maybe even as much as Madonna. Besides, if you do like Madonna, you probably shouldn't admit it, because people will usually either hate you or laugh at you. Even online.
0345452577|5.0|I love the Delaware books, but was pleasantly surprised by this change of character.  It was intellectually stimulating, and once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  Kellerman really seemed to be writing about subject matter he is obviously well-versed in, without making it too banal or over my head.  I cannot understand some of the negative reviews, but to each his own.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B00005JKJA|4.0|I came to MULHOLLAND DRIVE with extreme reluctance.  Although I've seen most of Lynch's work, it has been more by accident than by design, and I had no expectation of great interest in the film.  For Lynch is an extremely divisive director: you either like his work or you do not, and by and large I fall into the latter category.  So I sympathize with those who loathe everything about the film--but at the same time I am surprised by how much I myself admired it.<br /><br />Opening with an attempted murder thwarted by an unexpected car-crash, the film presents us with a beautiful woman (Laura Harring) who stumbles into Los Angeles in shock and suffering from amnesia.  Using the name &#34;Rita,&#34; she crosses paths with pert and pretty Betty Elms (Naomi Watts), new to the city and in search of a film career.  Betty quickly decides to shelter Rita, and the two women begin to search for Rita's true identity.<br /><br />A number of subplots, seemingly random incidents, and bizarre events complicate the basic premise; even so, I think most viewers will be able to buy into the film and find themselves extremely curious about the film's approaching conclusion.  But therein lies the rub, for it is exactly at this point that the film suddenly deconstructs and forces you to completely reevaluate everything you've previously seen.<br />A number of recent films, including the extremely popular SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS, have used a similar device, a sudden twist that spins your basic perception of the overall story.  In both cases, however, these were logical extensions of the basic plot; the device in MULHOLLAND DRIVE, however, is not, and it does not so much spin perception as it completely overturns and then completely reinterprets the entire film up to that point.  And there are only two possible reactions: jaw-dropping astonishment or a savage disgust with the whole thing.<br /><br />There have been endless interpretations and analyses of this film, and many people complain that they don't understand it.  I may be running against the tide here, but I have to say that you shouldn't try to &#34;understand&#34; MULHOLLAND DRIVE; instead, accept it as a journey into an extremely disturbed mind as it plays games with itself.  For with this film, Lynch essentially takes us inside madness itself, an insanity that dreams Hollywood dreams grown into monsters of the subconscious.<br /><br />Yes, I do think there is much to admire here in spite of several very obvious flaws--not the least of which is a distinct difference in tone as the film shifts between portions originally planned for television and portions filmed when Lynch realized he could salvage the project as a feature film.  But at the same time, admiring is not necessarily liking: MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a very dark place, and for myself one visit was enough.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerI may be running against the tide here, but I have to say that you shouldn't try to &#34;understand&#34; MULHOLLAND DRIVE; instead, accept it as a journey into an extremely disturbed mind as it plays games with itself.

B0000C6E4D|5.0|I am a recent Sarah fan. I lucked out and saw her in concert at Baltimore's Lyric Opera house on Dec 17 -- alternately playing a baby grand piano and her guitar.  Pure and unadulterated beauty!!! Few artists express themselves as passionately as this one, in person and in recordings.  Now that I have purchased ALL of her albums and listened to them all repeatedly, I see that Afterglow is more &quot;reserved&quot; perhaps, than others.  Her music has matured as she has, and I think it's a lovely and eloquent album, and best listened to alone through good headphones. Thank you, Ms. McLachlan!
0446677450|1.0|Let me begin by saying the positive aspects of the book.  If you are completely and thoroughly financially illiterate, then this book should at least get you thinking and going in the right direction.<br />Sadly, that's the limit of my positive aspects.  There are two huge problems with this book - first, the author suggests you do illegal things, and two, the author's past is incredibly dubious.<br />I don't know much about real-estate (I've read that there are legality issues, as well as poor recommendations in general, about some of his real-estate investments and his corporation), but I know my share about stocks.  Why is Martha Stewart in hot-water?  Insider trading.  Kiyosaki suggests that you get tips from your broker and friends (he asks, why have rich friends? Well, according to him, it's so that one can get inside information - &quot;the sooner you know, the better are your chances  for... minimal risk&quot;).  Even if it wasn't illegal, it's a very low reason for having friends.<br />Also, who is this rich dad of his?  Critics have been asking for years who he is, and Smart Money magazine asked the same thing.  His frustrated response was that rich dad was a conglomerate of a few different personalities.  To quote Kiyosaki, \\"Is Harry Potter real? Why don't you let Rich Dad be a myth, like Harry Potter?\\"  Yet, he also claims to have taken companies public.  According to SEC law, owners of a company with more than 5% of outstanding shares are recorded on various financial statements and documents, yet Kiyosaki is not listed on any of these.<br />Also, his net worth is a big secret, yet he once said that it is &quot;between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000, depending on the day.&quot; I feel very bad for a person whose net worth gets slashed that much on a day-to-day basis.  Infer what you want.<br />Nearly all of this is referencing to John T. Reed's excellent and thorough write-up about Kisoyaki: [...]  It's through his and his readers' research that I have come across this material.<br />I've wasted money on these books. I suggest you don't do the same.  A very, very big disappointment.

B000068QVN|5.0|During 1970 and 1971, the Power Trio \\"Grand Funk Railroad\\" (Mark Farner, Don Brewer, and Mel Schacher) under the management of Terry Knight set out to become the biggest Rock 'n' Roll Band in America. Not only did they succeed, but they even surpassed their own expectations. In the two years they released five albums.  `On Time' (an amazingly impressive, but raw debut album), `Grand Funk' (the consolidating second album), 'Closer to Home' (the first really Classic Album with the epic 'I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home'), and the Landmark `Live Album', which was released as a Warts and All exercise with no over dubs but just the music the way it was played on the night, a very brave thing to do at the time. It would have been so much easier and safer to have taken the tapes away and polished them up in the studio as most bands did, replacing bum notes and off key singing. But in true Yankee style,it was 'damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead'. In my opinion the idea worked. What you lost in perfection on that album you certainly made up for in excitement. The fourth studio album and fifth album all told 'Survival' was released just before the main part of this concert was recorded at Shea Stadium, New York, on the 7th of September 1971.<br />By this time Grand Funk Railroad had reached their aim and was the biggest band in the land.  They probably peaked at Shea Stadium that year, but there was still plenty of life left in the tracks. Soon they were to have two #1 singles in America - with a cover of Carole King's `Locomotion' (first a hit for `one-hit-wonder' \\"Little Eva\\", who at the time of her brief moment of fame was actually Carole King's babysitter!) and Drummer Don Brewer's first attempt at writing a song, which turned into the rock classic `We're an American Band', which was a hit all over the world and has since been covered by almost every American band you can think of. Although Grand Funk Railroad have lost Mark Farner through wear and tear over the years, Don Brewer and Mel Schacher have kept the band going to this day, and are still one of the hottest acts on the American concert circuit.<br />Although Shea Stadium was a peak for 'Grand Funk Railroad', a year later they fell out with Manager Terry Knight and spent more time in court than on the stage or the recording studio for the next couple of years. So a certain amount of momentum was lost. But at the time of these recordings they were bigger than 'Led Zeppelin', 'Black Sabbath', or even 'Cream' and had sold out Shea Stadium faster than 'The Beatles'.<br />The Shea Stadium concert was to be recorded for a full length feature movie, but before this could happen, band and management went their separate ways, and the whole thing was put up on the shelf.<br />Fortunately the tapes were dug out in 2002 and Capital Records realized what a little gold mine they were sitting on. Even better news was discovered when complete tapes of the concerts in Chicago and Detroit from two months before the Shea Stadium gig were found in perfect condition.<br />All these tapes were handed over to David. K. Tedds, who has done a marvelous job of seamlessly putting together an entire show from that hot summer of '71 and leaving it in its original running order with all the stage announcements, crowd cheering, and atmosphere of a good old Seventies Rock 'n' Roll concert.<br />The music starts out with the intro music taken from '2001' - a marvelous way of getting the audience on their feet, followed by Grand Funk Railroad's traditional opener \\"Are You Ready\\", which keeps the audience on their feet and rockin'. Grand Funk Railroad obviously had a lot of dog in them as they grab their followers by the scruff of the neck and just keep on shaking until they beg for forgiveness. The band storms through a set of all the highlights from their first five albums, and even includes one new song, the soon to be classic 'Footstompin' Music', which wasn't officially to be released for a few more months on their next album 'E Pluribus Funk'.<br />The medley of 'I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home/Hooked on Love/Get it Together' in the center of the set is the true work of artists playing at their peak of their powers as they showed at Shea Stadium.  The version of T.N.U.C. is seventeen minutes long and allows every member of the band space to stretch out and show their skills. Mark Farner was the obvious focal point of the band playing lead guitar, most of the lead vocals, keyboards, and at the time wrote all the songs. So he was the obvious person to get all the attention. But during T.N.U.C. Mel Schacher got to show off his dexterous bass playing, and Don Brewer takes a 10-minute drum solo that even listening to on audio, manages to keep interesting. (You can hear on the record that he certainly had the Detroit audience on his side).<br />After this strenuous workout you would forgive the band for taking a quick breather, but instead we get two cover versions to bring the set proper (before encore time) to a rousing conclusion. First we have a 15-minute version of 'The Animals' song, 'Inside Looking Out' written by Eric Burden and future Jimi Hendrix Manager Chas Chandler. Grand Funk Railroad take it apart and then smack it back together again in their own style with some wonderfully sprawling guitar solos and plenty of pathos in Mark Farner's endeavors to sing Eric Burdon's words. You even get another short Brewer drum solo just in case you had not had enough in T.N.U.C.<br />Then with the introduction from Mark Farner of `This Song is our Generation's National Anthem' the band screams into a powerful version of the Stones' `Gimmie Shelter', which may not have the light and shade of the Stones' original, but what it lacks in grace it more than makes up for in power and enthusiasm. Also proving how much effect the Brit invasion of the mid-sixties was still having on American Rock 'n' Roll.<br />After this there is only one song Grand Funk Railroad could possibly finish with - `Into The Sun'. (In those days seeing Grand Funk Railroad without them playing `Into The Sun' would be a bit like seeing Lynard Skynard without them doing `Freebird', or Deep Purple without `Smoke on the Water'.) `Into the Sun' starts off with the main lick played over softly until the first sung verse, where from this point onwards it builds and builds from guitar breaks to heavier drumming to Mel Schacher ringing every note out of the bass guitar until it reaches a thunderous climax. This version from Detroit (Motor City) is by far the most exciting ever officially released and worth the price of the album on it own.<br />To get yourself a little slice of the American Rock 'n' Roll dream, go out and get yourself a copy of Grand Funk Railroad's 'Live. The 1971 Tour', put it in your CD player, turn it up to 11, and enjoy.<br /><br />Mott the Dog.months on their next album 'E Pluribus Funk'. <br />The medley of 'I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home/Hooked on Love/Get it Together' in the center of the set is the true work of artists playing at their peak of their powers as they showed at Shea Stadium.

0380789035|3.0|Quite honestly, I am not sure.  Gaiman's premise sparks with imagination---as I am unfamiliar with most of the writers that he thanks in his Acknowledgements---as to whether or not it is his own imagination or that of others, I am not sure.  The main character, ex-con,Shadow, seems like a nice enough guy who reads Heroditus and has garnered quite a few other literary allusions even though we are told that his education is basic.  On the eve of his release from prison, he discovers his wife has died in a car accident, a little later on in the story he learns that she died in the company of her lover, Shadow's friend.  With this crushing truth weighing down upon him, Shadow meets and accepts a job with Mr. Wednesday, a man who seems to turn up when you least expect him and knows a little too much about Shadow's life.  Suddenly, Shadow finds himself immersed in a battle royal in which Wednesday and an assortment of odd characters struggle to maintain some hold on an America they were forced to voyage to while in the believing minds of Old Country immigrants.  Wednesday and his cronies are the old gods---Odin, Bast, and a cast of others---old, cranky and disillusioned by their diminished presence in American life as they are rapidly replaced by new gods of technology, wealth and power.  Wednesday tells Shadow that \\"a war is coming\\"--a war in which the two will battle for supremacy.<br /><br />Sounds great, doesn't it?  Well, it is in parts.  I found Shadow's sojourn into the small lakeside town in Michigan throughly entertaining--in fact if Gaiman had concentrated his efforts on making that his major plot, I think he could have successfully spun off all of his major themes in a more concise and precise manner that would not have left the reader scratching his head at major points in the story.  Not being that well-versed with some of the gods and legends that Gaiman alludes to, I would have found an appendix detailing some of the minor aspects of this lore paramount to my understanding and enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />After reading this nearly 600 pager, I regret to say that I don't think that there was much to ponder over, other than the rather obvious message that American life is consummed with immediate success and gratification rather than those which are founded on ritual and tradition. Shadow's role is never fully defined; other than his experience on the tree, he is very American; voyeur rather than participator---he may feel more alive, but what he does with that life, the story never defines.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Many of the other reviewers claim that Gaiman is a better comic book writer than a novelist.  I have not read his Sandman series, but I have read some good graphic novels that promote conversations and make good observations on modern and not-so-modern life in an entertaining way.  On a whole this book, does not do this.  A good premise basically goes wasted.  The tale of Hinklemann and the one untainted town in Michigan should have been given a little more detail and basically the same story could have been told with more impact. Recommended to those who want to read a 600 page book with aspirations to compare it with \\"The Stand\\".understanding and enjoyment of the story.  <BR><BR>After reading this nearly 600 pager, I regret to say that I don't think that there was much to ponder over, other than the rather obvious message that American life is consummed with immediate success and gratification rather than those which are founded on ritual and tradition.

B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. is a movie that demands something new from its audience, but it is does not mean you have to be a brain surgeon to figure this movie out.  This movie is obviously split into two parts.  In the first half, Naomi Watts' character is an aspiring actress and her life seems to play out like a dream.  Everything seems sublimely perfect -- in one scene it is almost histerically perfect.  When she steps off of the airplane in Los Angeles for the first time with the elderly couple, the scene reminds you of the type of over-the-top happy scene you would find in a movie from the 1950s.  It is done intentionally.  Later Watts' character finds herself slowly becoming a star in Hollywood -- her luck is almost too perfect.  But, it's not perfect.  Under this facade there are monsters lurking -- as is illustrated visually by the man scared of the monster behind the diner.  When Laura Harring's character is first introduced, she is in need of help and Watts gets to be the hero.  But as the second half of the movie emerges you realize that Watts is the one who needs help.  She watches as Harring becomes a star and everything about Hollywood now follows the path of the negative things we here about the town.  People become prostitutes and waitresses and ruin their lives.  What Lynch doesn't say is which one is real and which one isn't -- I guess neither is really true or false.  It depends on your perspective, but since it's all really a dream anyway then parts of both are true.  Lynch's movie is like poetry -- what you see is really a metaphor for something else.  The crux in understanding Mullholland Drive lies in watching it without expecting a linear plot line like you would in your normal Hollywood fare.  It is a poetry on film -- brilliant.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Even though she should have written a couple of more songs, it's still no. 1 in my book. I love EB, her shows are fabulous, her style is awesome, her voice is unique, her vibe is like whoa--The sista can't be sampled, duplicated, nor be compared to another female artist. She has her own style of creativity.
B00006879E|5.0|I can't begin to explain Maroon5's sound. It's... bizarre in a great way. Like many new artists nowadays, it's quite refreshing, and the music is certainly quite catchy. I can always get my mood up a few notches by simply listening to this CD on max volume while staring at the cieling.<br />The lyrics are both fun and captivating. There isn't a single song that stands out more than another.
078322608X|5.0|Some folks don't appreciate Terry Gilliam, and for good reason.  His dark vision can be troubling, in the same way that a lot of King Crimson's music can seem jarring, dissonant, and uncomfortable.  In part, it's because Gilliam's sensibilities are certainly outside of the mainstream.  He doesn't follow the typical chord progressions of mainstream film, even when his work is studio-funded.  He has an epic sense of the ideal, but also a dark, bitter sense of mankind.  It's as if Gilliam wishes that we could be redeemed, but knows it's all a sad fantasy.<br />Twelve Monkeys is, on its surface, a fascinating time travel story.  A violent, perhaps pathological, man from the future is repeatedly propelled into the past to collect information.  It seems the past is immutable, but it can still be studied.  (Indeed, in the final moments of the film, the futility of changing anything becomes clear--or does it?)<br />Bruce Willis, in a performance that shattered my instinctive dislike for him, struggles with a task that is extraordinarily difficult.  He both wants to save mankind, but also to lose himself in a better place.  The past, which isn't even his own past in one major respect, is like the prisoner's dream of heaven.  And Willis' character is, indeed, a prisoner.  He comes from a future where mankind has been all but wiped out by a bio-engineered virus, and the last vestiges of humanity are forced to live underground for fear that they, too, will be infected an die.<br />Like all of Gilliam's films, there is symbolism aplenty, as well as a rather neat tie in to apocalyptic visions throughout history--as if people from thousands of years ago somehow knew the future, as if it has already been written, and that even the Book of Revelations fortells the plague of 1996.  (It could be that the obvious problems with time travel have sent folks like Willis--and their knowledge of man's impending doom--throughout history, or that the past, present, and future exist simultaneously.)<br />This is film that is fun to watch time and time again.  With each viewing, there is more to see, are more clues to detect, are more fascinating discussions to be triggered.  Like a philosophical and artistic Rubic's Cube, 12 Monkeys is a delightfully dark fantasy that stimulates both the mind and the eyes.ously.)<br />This is film that is fun to watch time and time again.

0804106304|4.0|I was required to read this for my Honors English class freshman year. It was definitely interesting, but I found it hard to relate to on some levels because it is for such a female-oriented audience, and I wasn't able to identify with the foreign alienation that comes with being a Chinese immigrant.<br />The story is brisk at some times, yet scathingly slow in a couple parts. Nevertheless, the characters are all interesting and provide something different for every reader, and for every time you read it.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I recently purchased Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Soundtrack and was absolutely entranced by the music in it. Each song brought me further into a world of curses and secrets. I did find the layout of the songs to be slightly confusing, but I was pleased with it none the less. Klaus Baudelt truly captured the magic of pirates. I have always loved instrumentals, and I found this to be a classic. By purchasing this soundtrack, you are throwing yourself into a world where pirate ship flags wave in a mist of shadows. Bravo!

I'm looking forward to more releases from this band. <br />My favorite track, by the way, is Oblivion.

I haven't read a fairy tale in ages, and this one ranks as one of the best I've ever come across. The characters are hella hilarious, romantic, and all are either hateable or loveable. I highly recommend this to all readers, and hope you guys read it over again as much as I did.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I wish there's an option for 0 stars. This is one of the worst albums ever made...an artist that capitalizes on sex to hide the fact that she cannot sing. The awkwardness of some of these songs just makes you want to put your hands over your ears and scream no more! Don't waste your time or money on this!!!
0671027344|5.0|This book changed me. Being a sophomore in high school, it made me take a look at things and I realized how accurate the book is. People say high school is all about cliques, sex, drugs, rocknroll, and academics.<br />This book made me realize how much more there is to high school than that. It's the effects of these things that make the book so much deeper than the others in its specific drama. I've never looked at people in my school the same way again. And that's a good thing.
B00005JLR6|4.0|\\"In America\\" is Jim Sheridan's semi-autobiographical film of an Irish family who emigrate to America, partly to forget the pain of the loss of their young son.  This is an unforgettable film that touches the heart and demostrates the power of love to heal.  Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine are wonderful as the mon and dad who bravely struggle to raise their two adorable young daughters in their run-down tenement apartment in New York. There they meet a lonely, brooding and bitter artist from Africa, Mateo, who is dying of AIDS.  Almost magically, Mateo changes theirs and his own life in unexpected ways.  Although I feel that Sheridan sometimes tries a little too hard to tug at the heart strings, \\"In America\\" is a loving and touching film that truly moved me.
B000089RVX|5.0|Sure, Evanescene is mainstream. But they are GOOD mainstream. The vocals by Amy Lee are beautiful, and I would not be surprised if she released a solo CD. The back up vocalist brings the anger to the album, where Lee brings anger's undefineable beauty.<br />The lyrics, though depressing, all have something that one can relate to. It sounds cliche, but it's true. This nu-metal band simply has what it takes to go big. I'm glad they did.<br />Makes me wonder though, why did they break up? *sobs*
B0000062Y2|5.0|Amazing music, amazing cast.  This colloboration is, in my opinion, the best ever.  Barry Dennen is a decidedly twisted Pilate, and is potentially the best actor/singer in this version.
0425152251|5.0|This book is certainly imforative on the &quot;history of philsophy&quot;. I learned a lot about philosophy and European history from reading this weird novel. I have to admit, because of the translation some of the philosphy is really complicated and hard to understand until you've read the paragraph or two a few times over. <br />The story is also so far-fetched that once it developed, I was simply befuddled. I asked myself things such as &quot;where the heck did that come from?&quot;, among other things. The premise is creative once you discover it, but the last 100 pages or so are very... arbitrary and far-fetched. <br />Once the philsophy hits dialogue form instead of letter form (you'll understand it when you read the book), it becomes harder to follow, but it's still interesting all the same.<br />Recommended for sure.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is truly one of the greatest bands out there. Some people may not like the vocals, but no one out there can say they know better instruments. MY GOD MAN! they kick so much a$$ that they are in regular rotation in my car, my house, and all of my friends houses. They blend together punk, metal, 80's rock, and there own mixture so well, that i think they are one of the greatest bands ever. I love the lyrics, the music, and the singing. easily one of the best CD's within the last 15 years.
B0000508U6|5.0|There isn't a non-notable song on this album. Coldplay will go far in the business. British Rock doesn't get any better than this.<br />The songs are perfect for soothing yourself, chilling, hanging out, trying to calm yourself, get yourself motivated, or uplift your spirit. Nothing quite like it, in my honest opinion.

It has a lesson, humor, biblical allusion, and creativity.<br />The characters that interact all have the most subtle nuances, which isn't expected from a Kevin Smith film, but it really works. The religious humor is exponentially more funny to me because I know a huge amount of theology and much about Church History. Highly recommended.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC's first CD, Mer De Noms, was an incredbile derivative from Tool, involving a more surreal sound, more interesting lyrics, and a different style of vocals. In the first album, though, you still felt like you were listening to Tool.<br />It is in this album that APC finds their own sound. It is very surreal, chilling, and addicting. You no longer feel like you're listening to Tool. It's simply a new sound, unlike anything I've heard before.<br />Did I mention that the lyrics are creepy?
B00005JKES|5.0|Loved it...great set.  But it's just not right without the second season!
B0000027I6|2.0|Fans of Pink Floyd cannot ignore Roger Waters, and do so at their own peril. Very much the brains behind much of Pink Floyd's titanic efforts of the 1970s, it is very natural to seek the same quality from his solo efforts. My first piece of advice to listeners is to do nothing of the sort! Give Roger Waters a listen, but do so as if you never heard Pink Floyd, since this is the only fair way to judge it.<br />For me, the album features a wonderful lyrical layout. Even where we don't find Waters's lyrics, we can find moving word themes, such as in the &quot;Ballad of Bill Hubbard&quot;. The lyrics on this album will no doubt challenge the listener to question the dominant media culture that smothers us today. Roger Waters has always been a masterful songwriter, and none of this is suprising to me.<br />On the downside, is the music itself. The most positive comment is to call it minimalist, but this would only be covering up what I truly think. Despite the presence of great musicians such as Jeff Beck on the album, there is little here to show for it. There are occasional bright spots, but the music otherwise tends to drag down the quality of the listening experience.<br />Much has been said of Waters's vocals on this album, and to me they lack the passion and depth of which I know him capable. His vocals are tired and nearly whispered, and do little to carry these lyrics, which deserve better.<br />I would love to have seen a better emphasis on the music and vocals, to carry what could have otherwise been a masterpiece.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I've been reading some of the other reviews of this CD, and I have to say I'm a bit puzzled by them. Yes, it's true that some of the things that made the original release fun have been eliminated here (at least from the main disc), but in my opinion those things were the only things that made the original issue arguably more enjoyable than this version. The rest of that album was depressingly overdone. Phil Spector adding his typical production qualities to these songs was the musical equivalent of tossing an anvil to someone who, while maybe not drowning, was doing not much more than treading water. In my opinion (again), anything that could be done to reverse that damage is welcome. I don't think many would argue that a lot of the material here is thinner than earlier efforts (and in the case of &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; technically later efforts as well). Because of that, I think it takes a &quot;clean&quot; listening to these songs to allow their inherent charm to come through. No matter how these guys were or weren't getting along, they appear to genuinely enjoy playing together, and that's a quality you can now hear on this CD. And it's a rare quality in any recording, by any artist.<br />In all fairness to Phil Spector, he really gave some of the songs a relatively, though uncharacteristically light touch, and the &quot;new&quot; versions of those don't seem too different beyond the overall improvement in sonics. But stripping away the overblown production work on &quot;Let It Be&quot; and especially &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (the latter of which I never really liked until now) has left those numbers exposed as the fragile beauties they really are. And at the very least, the cleaner remastering of all of the material allows you to hear &quot;into&quot; the songs so much better that you find yourself noticing things you may never have noticed before. You become more involved in the music, and in my book, that's an improvement. One example that comesto mind is &quot;For You Blue,&quot; in which the tiny little pizzicato high-pitched plucking of strings (now in the left channel when it was originally in the right - go figure) drew me into the song in a completely new way. It reminded me of the sound you get when you pick strings between the bridge and the tailpiece of the guitar (if your guitar has that kind of setup). For all I know that may be what we're hearing. I used to play around like that with my banjo occasionally and hearing it in this kind of<br />12-bar-blues/pickup-band sort of piece is really charming. You think, &quot;I could be playing that,&quot; and I don't mean that in a bad way.<br />Get this CD and listen closely to it. I guarantee you'll find yourself more immersed in the music than you've ever been with the original. And if you're still among those who wail lamentations over the elimination of the between-song patter and humorous introductions (or even the sequencing, for god's sake), no one is telling you to get rid of your copy of the original album. You can own both, you know.
B0000CNY27|4.0|When I was an 11 year old kid, there was no one cooler than Snake Plissken. Even Indiana Jones didn't have a chance. This movie has always been one of my favorites, but in a hokey, fun way. Much like Waterworld was a strong end-of-the-world concept with a weak film production, this movie is what it is: A low budget, campy B movie with some memorable, colorful characters. Carpenter can be criticized for using the same actors over and over again in his movies. As is mentioned in the commentary: \\"Both of our ex-wives are in this movie.\\" Then he tarnished the original film by producing a forgettable sequel.   <br />I always thought the weapons that they gave Snake were cool but bad choices for rescuing a man from a prison. Why is there a scope on a Mac 10? How stealthy is a chrome plated pistol? Can you really kill someone with a throwing star? The silliest action sequence has to be when Snake wastes a whole clip of ammo to shoot a hole through that super thin wall. This scene is shown too many times in the trailer etc. Snake's finest moment belongs in a Zucker Brothers (Airplane) movie. Why is the MAC 10 still loud even with the silencer on it? Some people don't know that Jim Cameron worked on this movie as as special effects guy. His attention to detail is evident. <br />Has Carpenter \\"dumbed down\\" this movie too much? All of the graphics showing the wall around the city, the historical references to the crime rate rising in 1988 and the city being converted into a prison in 1991. Carpenter says during his commentary that this was all necessary because people didn't understand the setting of the story. Maybe that \\"small group of people\\" who previewed the movie should have been a little larger or smarter? I agree that the opening bank robbery sequence is too long and it softens the Snake character too much. Some of the best post-apocalyptic movies I've seen don't reference a specific year (The Road Warrior, Waterworld). The dates make this movie less timeless now. <br/>I enjoyed the commentaries but was disappointed when Kurt says \\"that was 14 years ago.\\". That was when I knew that the commentary from the mid-90's laserdisc edition had simply been lifted and put on this new DVD release. I anxiously awaited some sort of comment on the World Trade Center/ 9/11, but that happened years after this laserdisc commentary was made. A plane was crashed into a building and the WTC was a key landmark in the movie. I couldn't help but wonder why this subject was ignored. Debra Hill's commentary was done in 2001, but obviously prior to 9/11. Kurt is a fun guy and I also enjoyed his commentary on Used Cars. <br />The new documentary that revisits the movie was good. I enjoyed seeing all the faces again, even though it made me feel old. The packaging is gorgeous but it ripped on one of the folds when I was trying to dig the comic book out of its pocket. <br />I still say that Jerry and David Zucker could make a funny movie spoofing the classic futuristic post-apocalyptic films. Snake Plissken would need to be in it though.
6305291446|5.0|this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life
B00008NG5V|5.0|I've seen Jack Johnson live in San Diego more times than I can count, and trust me, he always keeps you coming back for more. His sophomore album does nothing less than sparkle, and keeps close to his roots following his debut, Brushfire Fairytales. <BR>  &quot;Rodeo Clowns&quot; and the &quot;Horizion Has Been Defeated&quot; gives in to that playful side, but he generally keeps the mood relaxed. Although some songs are a bit serious (Traffic in the Sky) and some are downright depressing (Cocoon), he keeps the heavier subjects light with his mellow voice and soft guitar. But what I TRULY love about this album is that in almost every track you can kick back and feel an ocean breeze and a beach feel that only he creates.
B00005JMCN|4.0|When I first heard about this movie, I thought that it would be the best movie I have ever seen.  Then, when I finally watched it, I found that it was a little bit dragged out and wasn't really focused pn the horse, but more of the jokey and it's owner's lives.  It was still a good movie, just not as good as they are advertising it to be.
B00004HYLF|5.0|Along with The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return To Forever were one of the few major jazz-fusion/rock bands to gain popularity, and bring jazz to a wider audience, albeit in a rock context. These fusion bands generally created a more accessible form of jazz: by filtering it through large doses of the aforementioned rock aesthetic.<br />While this album has received everlasting praise from critics and fans alike, I was quite disappointed with this on the first few listens. The turn-offs at the time? The slickness of it all. While I found the musicianship quite accomplished, I found it to be quite cold, dry, over-manufactured and plastic-sounding, which gave me a feeling of the music coming off as quite soulless. The synthesizer effects in many of the songs sounded flavorless and insubstantial, and the drum sonics sounded quite dry and plastic as well. As far as synthesizers go, I'll be the first to disagree with the many who say that they produce little or no emotional substance, but here, this was the first time I was ever compelled to agree with the many detractors.<br />Most importantly, I was disappointed in this because everything mentioned above that bothered me seemed to be the very things that go against what I assumed are/were the very principles of jazz and/or jazz-fusion; the music needs feeling, it needs soul, it needs fire, it needs purposeful, authentic expression. A highly respected friend and pal of mine -- if he reads this review, he will know exactly who he is -- doesn't enjoy this album for the exact reasons listed above, and it's safe to say that I fully understand why. Only difference between us regarding our opinion of the album? He still doesn't enjoy the album, while my opinion has changed, and I now enjoy it.<br />One thing I like to think that I've learned is that you shouldn't always place expectations on what should be, and what shouldn't. If you place a great deal of expectation on things, you are more than likely setting yourself up for disappointment. Sometimes it's best to leave your preconceptions and expectations behind, and be prepared for anything.<br />Now, shouldn't I be trying to describe the music on here? Yes! That's right!<br />Musicians Chick Corea (keyboards), Al DiMeola (guitars), Lenny White (drums) and Stanley Clarke (basses) create some highly enjoyable, utterly infectious music, which is also quite fun to listen to as well. The music still has a certain slickness to it, but this one-time aggravating aspect has dissolved into an indescribable charm, albeit a quirky one.<br />\\"Medieval Overture\\" starts off with some twinkling synthesizer taps, which combine with other synth textures to create an ethereal, spiraling, and seemingly labyrinthine atmosphere. It propels forth an ambience: at once encircling, while penetrating the mind; in both peripheral and primal areas. Lenny White in particular shows off his flamboyant drumming, and you get the sense that Lenny was quite a flamboyant character when listening to this. The title of this song resembles that of a classic progressive rock track, and while many mention that this offering shares much in common with bands like Yes, ELP and King Crimson -- and in some ways, it does -- it doesn't necessarily sound too much like either of those bands to me, nor does it sound much like prog-rock in general.<br />\\"Sorceress\\" is a funkified jam written by drummer Lenny White. It doesn't mix things up too much in the rhythm for the duration of the track, which is sometimes frustrating. This bothered me on the first few listens, but, now, I've come to appreciate the extended grooves. The jazzy piano chords, and their elegant-sounding arpeggios, the multi-dimensional basslines, and the drumming; particularly in the way the cymbals are used here. Utterly romantic and sensual.<br />The title track shares a kinship with the previous track; in the sense that the rhythm stays pretty much the same throughout. Mid-tempo and relatively relaxed, the seemingly straightforward rhythm kept by Lenny White on the drums is something of a container for the other musicians to exhibit their respective strengths: Al DiMeola gives us some lightning-fast, yet polished and seemingly effortless soloing, Chick Corea gives us elaborate, yet restrained and atmospheric sprinkles of piano, and Clarke, as usual delivers some impressive basslines.<br />\\"Majestic Dance\\" is the closest thing to a typical hard rock song on this album - excepting the quirky, virtuosic instrumental passages played in unison. This shouldn't be too much of a surprise, since it was written by guitarist Al DiMeola. Features melodic, yet fiery solos, and virtuosic flights between guitars, bass and keys that are very precise and impressive.<br />\\"The Magician\\" is my favorite track on here. This track features elements that resemble prog-rock more closely than any other track on the album. Written by Stanley Clarke, the dynamics and motifs are quite mercurial and chameleonic; even including Renaissance and Baroque elements (which resemble Gentle Giant a bit.) A quirky mixture of impressive virtuosic flights (the bass playing on here impresses me the most), utter bombast, and whimsy: there's even the sound of an alarm clock going off to close out the song, which is credited under one of Lenny White's instrumental contributions.<br />\\"Duel of The Jester and The Tyrant\\" may run in a close second to the previous track in resembling the attributes of classic *prog* rock. The first part features chord phrasing which impressed me highly, and the virtuosic basslines from Clarke are what I soak up the most here. The second half is probably my favorite part of the track: features a main descending line which exhibits galactic, skyscraping bombast which perfectly evokes the image of an arena battle, so to speak. The synthesizer lines in particular, take this image even further, to evoke that of a video game.<br />Give this one a shot if you have any interest in fusion. Skilled musicianship combines with accessibility, infectiousness and quirkiness. Sounds like a great combination to me.traightforward rhythm kept by Lenny White on the drums is something of a container for the other musicians to exhibit their respective strengths: Al DiMeola gives us some lightning-fast, yet polished and seemingly effortless soloing, Chick Corea gives us elaborate, yet restrained and atmospheric sprinkles of piano, and Clarke, as usual delivers some impressive basslines.<br />\\"Majestic Dance\\" is the closest thing to a typical hard rock song on this album - excepting the quirky, virtuosic instrumental passages played in unison.

B00005JKZV|5.0|I was too young to see any of the Star Wars films and too old to care for the Harry Potter films, but I am completely in awe of this beautiful film. It was the prospect of the dvd with all its extras which formed the entire reason I even bought a dvd player! I absolutely love it! I can die happy having seen it.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This was one of the best star trek movies... I totally recomend.
6305128952|4.0|This is a richly acted and beautifully photographed film about wounded psyches of both the human and animal kind. The disturbing horse/vehicle accident at the beginning of the film is realistic and even painful to watch but is essential in establishing the depth of the emotional torment that followed in its tragic and inevitable wake. Physically maimed for life, young Grace MacLean had a great deal of physical and emotional healing in her immediate future. I cannot say enough about the superb acting of young Scarlett Johansson in bringing a certain depth and sensitivity to this demanding role. She was simply brilliant in a quiet and understated way. Both Grace and her beloved horse \\"Pilgrim\\" who narrowly avoided being put down as a result of his awful trauma injuries are both destined to begin a slow emotional healing process even more painful than the setting of mere bone and scarred flesh. The restorative process leads Grace's high achieving mother Annie (Kristin Scott-Thomas) to take Grace and Pilgrim on a cross country motor journey to distant Montana to seek out the services of noted \\"horse whisperer\\" Tom Booker.  Robert Redford was at his acting best in this role and in a minimalist way he quietly defined a serene and hard working rancher whose unique gift was an almost otherworldly understanding of animals.  Annie had personal issues of her own to deal with that transcended the focus of the trip and she too had to sort through a complex stew of emotional feelings laid bare as a result of the experience. As the process of healing plays itself out over time at the Booker ranch, all too human emotional baggage attached to everyone involved is inevitably exposed, aided no doubt by a close and personal proximity. This is where Redford positively shined as director. He never forced issues, always allowing individual moments of epiphany to unfold in a naturally relaxed way. The film ends in a bittersweet but profoundly sober manner, not unlike the way life often unfolds for those with holes in their heart. Bring a handkerchief to this one, you'll not be disappointed. Whether you shed a tear of joy or sorrow matters not. You'll be richer for the experience.
078401213X|5.0|A crasy movie, takes a crasy mind to undestand. Watch this movie, if you can handle it!!!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|SCARFACE is one of the greatest movies of all time. I have heard from countless people that this is a good movie and from seeing previews and reading reviews it looked good so I watched it. After seeing for the for the first time, I was blown away by the movie and the somewhat realistic feel the movie had. Al Pacino was excellent in this movie, I have never seen a good Pacino movie {ex: Dick Tracy}. This movie is without a doubt a classic movie, when I say \\"classic movie\\" I mean a movie that you can quote constantly, a movie you can't stop talking about, and a movie that you own.<br />THE DVD: This DVD is a great DVD for any collection or collector. This DVD has no left overs just new stuff. The intresting thing besides the featurettes was the \\"TV VERISON MONTAGE\\", that was so funny and intresting cause I don't think people realize the moron things they edit a movie and it goes to cable, i'd like to see that on more special edition DVD's. I own the boxset and its a must for anyone who loves this movie.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This is the biggest load of crud I have ever listened to. I made the mistake of listen to the reviews here. These guys couldn't hold Pink Floyd's jock. At least U2 know how to make a melody. Even pearl Jam once in awhile put a chorus in their songs. I believe people like this garbage because it makes them feel indie. Your all a bunch of sheep!!!
B00005NB8K|4.0|THE DOORS is a great movie but I would have giving it 5 stars but if movie was based on real accounts. For one instant Jim didn't quit film school he actually graduated and made a couple of films but thats all I will say about that aspect. The movie was excellent, the acting was great espically the actors who played The Doors were excellent. This is one of those \\"semi-Biographical\\" flicks done right, I mean the doors in the movie actually look like the real doors. I thought Val Kilmer did a excellent job playing Morrison, he looked and sounded like him. Of course the soundtrack is excellent cause most of it is Doors music. If your aren't a Doors fan or just becoming one then I highly recommend it.<br />THE DVD: The DVD is alright, The only thing I didn't like about the DVD was it was a reprint of the laserdisc version of it. Besides for the deleted scenes and orignal featurette I was kinda of hoping for a new documentary on the movie. Other than that the picture and sound is great. If you enjoyed this movie then its a must to own on DVD.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This is an amazing album. Can't find one song on it that isn't easy on the ears. Main songs include &quot;12:51&quot;, &quot;Reptilia&quot;, &quot;I Can't Win&quot;, and &quot;Under Control&quot;. Under Control is an very different song from where the Strokes usual are. Very Mature. Reptilia is an awesome fast paced rock song. I Can't Win is fun, and 1251 (1st single) is a very catch song. I've seen the strokes twice this year on tour and can't get enough of them. Can't wait for a new album, it keeps getting better.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is easily the most refreshing and imaginative release in quite some time.  The singles were enough to make me venture out to the record store (a place I try to avoid), but the strength of the albumn has compelled me to write this review.  This albumn should be bought and not downloaded because the artist deserves every penny for this solid disc.  It is worth its weight in gold.<br />The riffs are sufficently heavy and are sharply contrasted by Amy Lee's amazing voice.  She delivers the lyrics with a power and grace that will blow your hair back.  There are also some imaginative string and choral arrangments.  Guitar solos (a lost art) even make their way onto this albumn!!! When's the last time you heard a new band solo??  Did Korn or even Metallica solo on their recent releases?? Nope. In addition, you can detect a bit of a hip hot beat at points to compliment the percussion.  Another plus is you can almost taste the Iron Maiden influence on some tracks (this alone makes it a winner in my book).  The albumn is an engaging and enjoyable listen as a result.  <br />My only issue with this recording is the use of effects on Amy Lee's voice.  Her voice is so strong that they are completely unnecessary.  But they are used sparingly enough to make it a minor fault and warrent the five star rating.  <br />Its painfully obvious, although maybe not so to critics of this albumn, that a lot of thought went into this production.  I read through some of the reviews and I think most of the critics are the victims of their own conspiracy theories.  Just because an albmun is mainstream does not mean its bad.  This release was not the concoction of some pop tart or record executive attempting to predict what would best appeal to the masses.  Sadly, this make Evanesence the exception rather than the rule.  The market has been saturated with bad, boaring and shallow music for so long that many may dismiss this mainstream success as unworthy of praise as a result.  However, good music is good music and if good music appeals to the mainstream, then that's a step in the right direction.  Evanesance's Fallen is not good but great music.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This was well ahead of it's time and even if a new band released something similar now, it would still rock.  Eddie VH more or less re-invented the guitar and influenced hundreds of thousands of players.  Simply awesome.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|As an owner of Britney's 3 previous studio CDs (no hater here), I have to say I was completely disappointed with In The Zone. I've heard it labeled as a &quot;fun party CD&quot; to excuse the pathetic lack of depth or growth on the album ... but it can't even measure up to a guilty pleasure pop-party disc.<br />I've had the CD since the day it came out and I wanted to wait awhile before reviewing to give it a fair chance ...<br />Me Against The Music - One of the worst songs she's ever released. Completely unoriginal and the use of Madonna is wasted on a track that would *never* make it on one of her decent albums. 2/5<br />(I've Got That) Boom Boom - Typical Britney with more of a hip-hop feel. Too bad the incessant whining of the Ying Yang Twins put a damper on good, clean, get-up-and-dance fun. Not bad. 3/5<br />Showdown - Completely different than any other Britney song, unfortunately also completely boring. The song is easy to tire of and her voice sounds as nasaly and computer generated as ever. 2/5<br />Breathe On Me - Decent. Obviously used for the shock value of the subject matter, but nonetheless it's a pretty catchy song. It sounds like Kylie Minogue and she could probably sing it better. 3.5/5<br />Early Mornin' - A clone of Showdown. Boring, boring, boring. Even Moby can't save this one. 2/5<br />Toxic - The much-hyped fan fave of the CD ... it's actually pretty good. Different, with a James Bond/Secret Spy feel. More of a British Pop sounding song, it probably won't do as well on the American airwaves as it should. 4.5/5<br />Outrageous - Garbage. R. Kelly can make some great stuff, but this doesn't merit a slot on either his nor Britney's CDs. Albeit, the beat is catchy ... if you can get past the hokey lyrics. 2/5<br />Touch of My Hand - It took me a little bit to get used to this song, but I find it one of the best on the CD. The subject matter is dealt in a mature manner (no moans and annoying ad-libs from Britney a la &quot;Boom Boom&quot;) and the Asian beats are something fresh and different. 4/5<br />The Hook Up - Catchy hip-hop, also took me awhile to like. Definitely makes you want to dance. 4.5/5<br />Shadow - Simply a cute pop ballad. No thought-provoking lyrics or exceptional vocals, but the melody carries the song just fine. 3.5/5<br />Brave New Girl - Too synthesized and too cheesy. The vocals are horrendous and the beat is seriously lacking. 2/5<br />Everytime - A childish, sweet ballad obviously about a certain someone. Not that bad, not that great either. The lyrics, while simple, are obviously heartfelt. A much needed step-up from the awful &quot;Dear Diary&quot;. 3.5/5<br />Again, very disappointed by Britney's 4th disc. Justin Timberlake's &quot;Justified&quot; is the CD I'd choose if you really want the party disc, and Christina Aguilera's &quot;Stripped&quot; has the vocal and lyrical maturity that Britney's &quot;In The Zone&quot; should have had.
B00008PW2D|4.0|Despite the shortness of the season I still found this to be one great season! <br />I had the impression it was more of a recollection of all the previous seasons. Nothing really significant in the movie apart from Bradie's birth. <br />The rest well.... It is nice ( like Carrie getting published ) but I felt it more like a culmination of life goals in the girls lives. Reaching that high ( or low depending on your point of view ) point in life.<br />Fearing to sound a bit contradictive, this season reflects of the deepest joy as well as the biggest despair. The girls becoming to some extent content with their fate and letting it all go.<br />In some specific details I found Miranda to be insanely sexy despite her rounded body ;) .. Charlotte going wild with \\"hairy\\" ... Samantha and the cantelope breakdown totally losing it! .. and Carrie starved \\"Big\\" time.<br />Hands down more worth it then season 3 and 4. <br />Defenitely a season I'll be watching repeteadly ( like I do for season 1 and 2 .. and not 3 / 4 cause they just .. well .. no comment ).<br />Oh and lastly, I don't know if it's just my misperception but I did find this season to be a little to \\"grainy\\" at times, but some shots and camera traveling was much more studied then previous seasons which I highly enjoyed. ( Sorry about the little boring technical details ;) )
B00005JM02|4.0|Finding Nemo was an excellent movie for children of all ages.  I am at a stage right now where I cannot fully appreciate &quot;children's movies&quot; anymore.  I know there was a lot of work put into this, and I did enjoy it, but it just wasn't one of my favorite movies.  I think that I am just outgrowing the &quot;children's movies&quot; because I am more interested in action-type movies.  But all in all it is still a great movie, that I am sure I will absolutely love when I am an adult (I know my mother does.)
B00005JMGL|1.0|I read the book about two weeks before I saw the movie. Let me tell you, If it wasn't for the same basic plot and some of the characters being the same I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be the same. Added characters, added scenes, and changed scenes. What was the screen writer thinking? Maybe if I had never read the book it would have been a good movie. The only good thing about the movie was some of the children's reactions in the theatre. It was a lot darker than previous pan movies. One child exclaimed \\"They can't do that\\" as peter was slammed onto the rock by hook. Save your money and make it a rental unless you havn't read the book or you're sure it won't bother you if everything is kinda off.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw this on Broadway last week, bought the CD during the break between the two acts, and have been listening to it almost constantly since.  Both the musical and it's music are simply one of the most awesome things to come out of Broadway in years.<br />The CD starts off, like the play, with the somewhat discordant &quot;No One Mourns the Wicked&quot;, which took me quite some time to warm up to -- it's a strange piece introducing everything, and while perfectly fitting setup for the story to come, it's hard to like.  &quot;Dear Old Shiz&quot; is a mostly forgettable &quot;school song&quot; piece returning the story back in time to when Galinda (the future Glinda) and Elphaba (the future Wicked Witch) first met at school.<br />The first real hint of greatness comes with the third track, &quot;The Wizard and I&quot;, which is, on the surface, a nice song about Elphaba's hopes and dreams for the future, but underneath contains delightful irony. &quot;What is this Feeling&quot; follows up with a fairly funny and entertaining telling of Galinda and Elphaba's initial feelings toward each other, while &quot;Something Bad&quot; provides the listener the only real hint on the CD about the underlying conflict (&quot;Animals should be seen and not heard&quot;) which drives the plot.  &quot;Dancing through Life&quot; introduces Fiyero, and has some entertaining bits, but is mostly fluff.  <br />It's when Kristin Chenoweth (Galinda) sings &quot;Popular&quot; that you get hooked.  This is an incredibly funny song, sung exquisitely by Kristen.  Despite it's humor, it drives home an important theme of the show - it isn't how you look, or what you are that's important, it's how others perceive you to be.  From this point on, every song is chock full of meaning, and almost all the remaining tracks are awesome, with only a few exceptions.<br />&quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot; is a simple, moving song about love that can't be, and &quot;One Short Day&quot; is an extravaganza introducing the Emerald City which, at least to me, evoked a Disney theme park right from the start, and also slyly plays with your perceptions of things.  &quot;A Sentimental Man&quot; is Joel Grey's (The Wizard) first full song, and isn't really much by itself without getting the context of the rest of the musical, including things the audience hasn't yet seen.  (In that context, or if you read the book, it's incredibly ironic...)<br />&quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is the Act 1 ending, and it's an incredibly awesome and satisfying showstopper -- Idina Menzel (Elphaba) gives a performance that has to be heard to be believed.  This is the turning point of the show, and worth buying the CD for just this one track.<br />&quot;Thank Goodness&quot; opens Act 2, and Kristen's performance here clearly shows how her character has changed by the events ending Act 1.  Along with &quot;Wonderful&quot;, which follows it, they drive the theme of how people are perceived right out into the open.<br />&quot;As Long as You're Mine&quot; is a nice song between Elphaba and Fiyero that builds up that love relationship and sets the stage for the next song, &quot;No Good Deed&quot;, where Idina once again shows how incredible a performer she is.  &quot;The March of the Witch Hunters&quot; is more a stage piece than anything else - it advances the story a great deal, but a lot of it assumes you know things which happened in-between the songs.<br />&quot;For Good&quot; is a touching and beautiful song reconciling Glinda and Elphaba before the end, and is reprised in part by the &quot;Finale&quot;, which is a bit disappointing musically, but is another one of those pieces which needs to be seen on stage for the best impact.<br />The biggest flaw in the CD is that it would have been nice for those who have NOT seen the show if there were some notes about the context of the songs, even though that might reveal some plot twists (and there are quite a few of those...).   But while this may not be perfect, it's still a great CD and worth listening to if you like Broadway musicals.  Highly recommended.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The movie was great. This special edition has a lot on it.<br />You know what the movie's synopsis is. The cool thing about the extended eddition is that almost every extra scene is put in perfectly. If you were to watch this without ever seeing the theatrical version you would probably not be able to see where they added in the new scenes. The first disc has a lot of extra scenes with orcs. There is also one about Pippin growing. The second disc has the bulk I would say. There are a lot of enjoyable new segments. A great addition is the Boromir scene which was sadly cut from the theatrical release.<br />The commentary is brilliant. Well, the actor's commentary is. I haven't watched the others yet. The actor's all have storys to tell, and there are quite a few good ones. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum tend to argue a lot. Sam always has to tell you how extroadinary or amazing something was using his huge vocabulary. They are sadly boring. The highlight of the commentary is Merry and Pippin. They own disc one. The second disc they don't get to do that much except the few ending scenes where they get some words in. Theodin owns disc 2 with hilarious stories every time he talks. He has a lot of stories that will make you crack up. Also, he uses some curse words but they beep them out.<br />I love the movie. The extras are great though. The one about tolkien is kind of interesting but I think they already did that on the Fellowship special eddition. The additions are highly entertaining though and the reason to buy this dvd.
B00005JKJA|4.0|A film by David Lynch<br />The first thing to mention is that this was a confusing movie.  I knew that I was watching a quality film, but as the movie went on, I was less and less sure about exactly what it was that I was seeing.  After it was over, I had no idea what just happened, but I enjoyed the time spent (2 and a half hours).<br />A woman is in a car wreck.  She appears to be the only survivor and she stumbles away from the scene of the accident until she makes her way outside an apartment complex (a fairly nice one, at that).  She falls asleep behind some bushes, and when daylight comes, she sneaks in to one of the apartment and stays there.  A woman named Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives at that same apartment to take residence there.  Betty discovers the woman, who calls herself Rita (Laura Harring), but Rita has amnesia and does not even remember her own name.  Betty befriends Rita, and tries to help Rita figure out what happened to her.  This part is fairly straight forward, but as the film progresses there are little things thrown in that do not make much sense even though we think that it may be important.  I do not want to reveal what these are for fear of spoiling some of the enjoyment of trying to unravel this movie.  Even with the semi-confusing stuff, the movie mostly makes sense until close to the end where there is a twist (not your typical plot twist, but rather one that changes how you look at the whole movie) and this confused me more than anything else in the movie.  I understood what happened, but I didn't get it.  Someone explained the movie to me later, and I'm still not quite sure it makes sense.<br />This is a strange movie, but good.  The acting was good with Naomi Watts and Laura Harring impressing.  I can't really comment on the Lynch's directing because that depends on how much the movie really made sense and connected together.  I enjoyed it, but this is the kind of film that takes multiple viewings to truly make sense of it.

B00008DDXC|4.0|A film by Chris Columbus<br />This is the second Harry Potter film and is the sequel to 2001's &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;.  Like the first film, this one is also based on the book of the same title by J.K. Rowling.  Also like the first film, this movie adaptation is faithful to the novel.  This movie is set during Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />Like the previous movie, this one begins before school starts and Harry is still staying with his aunt and uncle.  He has not heard from his friends all summer, and he is forbidden to send out his owl to send letters to his friends.  It seems like a typical summer for Harry, except when a house elf named Dobby (Tony Jones, voice) appears and tries to convince Harry not to return to Hogwarts.  Naturally, Harry is going to go back, it is the only place of happiness that he knows.  But this is the set up and lets us know from the start that something is going, and we just don't know what it is yet.<br />When school begins, Harry is reunited with his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).  Of course, they have several adventures even before the main story truly begins.  There is a new teacher at the school, Professor Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), the professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.  He is a preening, pompous, self-absorbed fool, but all of the female students love him.<br />The story truly begins when a student turns up petrified and there is a note written on a wall saying &quot;The Chamber of Secrets has been opened&quot;.  This sets the school abuzz with rumors of what the Chamber is and what happened the last time the Chamber was opened.  This is, of course, the beginning of the adventure for Harry, Hermione, and Ron, as they strive to discover what is happening and who is behind it, and how to stop it.<br />&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was just as good as the first movie, and has a similar feel to it (which makes sense since both films have the same director).  It was an enjoyable movie, if a little long for children's movie.  The movie captures the events and look of the novels, but like the first film, it lacks the tone and joy of reading the books.  The novels have such a fast paced, wonderful tone that the movies simply cannot recreate.  I find enjoyment in the movies because I have read the books, but I'm not sure if that same enjoyment would come across to those who have not read the books.feel to it (which makes sense since both films have the same director).

6305603847|5.0|I believe that people who rated this film as bad did not understand it or pink floyd's music for that matter. This film is a masterpiece and has so many concepts that one should watch it more than twice to get a grasp of it's wisdom. The music is unbelievable and combined with the images created for this film, it is one of the best things ever put on tape/dvd. Watch it if you appreciate pink floyd's music. If you don't wait until you do and then watch it. roger waters is god.

6305949980|5.0|This movie is truly a masterpiece.  I have never seen any other movie like it.  The claymation is original, and fascinating for the eyes.  The songs are catchy, and the storyline is as well.  The characters are unforgettable.  Jack, Sally, and the rest of the gang are perhaps some of film's most unique and original characters.  Tim Burton is a mastermind, who has delivered a flawless movie.  It respectably can be considered a timeless classic.  I recommend this movie to anyone who admires Burton's other works.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first heard that the boys from Rage were teaming up with Chris Cornell, my first reaction was of disappointment. Did they honestly expect to replicate Rage Against the Machine's well, rage? The awesome guitar riffs? They were even making the album self-titled, just like Rage Against the Machine by RATM. This would surely be a bomb. I would however give them a chance.<BR>  When the box from amazon bearing Audioslave arrived, I opened it warily and put on the CD, bracing for the worst. I then proceeded to eat my shoe, which it isn't to bad with a nice dose of ketchup. Audioslave is one of the few CDs that I can listen to all the way through, ranking up there with Ten by Pearl Jam.<BR>  They weren't try to replicate the sounds of old, but reinventing themselves. Surrounded by hip-hop music, if it qualifies, terrible pop-rock, and pop music like Britney Spears, this was a much needed relief. Tom Morello is a musical genius, and Chris's voice and lyrics tie in the music like no one else could ever do. This is a CD that I will enjoy listening to over and over again until Audioslave's next album comes out. This is a won over Audioslave fan signing out.
0452282152|1.0|This book is sentimental clap-trap from an amateurish historical imagination addicted to forced and ill-considered metaphors. <br />It's the first book I've ever actually thrown in the garbage.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I found this album in the racks at Best Buy the week after Christmas.  Until then, I didn't know DT had a new CD out.  That's sad, since I used to keep up with them religiously.  I picked it up and have been listening to it for a few days in my car.<br />Some history: I became a DT fan after seeing them and hearing them for the first time live at an outdoor concert in Detroit Lakes, MN.  They were the headline act at some Fargo rock station's 25th anniversary bash.  I hadn't heard a note of their stuff, and was blown away!  That would have been around the time &quot;Images and Words&quot; came out.  Pull Me Under was the &quot;big&quot; single.<br />Now, on to the review:<br />Being a fan (perhaps too strong of a word) of some nu metal stuff, I immediately noticed the similarities.  At one point, after leaving the car, then getting back in several hours later, I thought I had left Disturbed in the CD player.<br />My personal favorite's by DT include &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; (for personal reasons), &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; [ducking for cover] and the first half of &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.&quot;  These are the discs that moved me, what true prog should do.  I loved the artsiness and skill required to pull off &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot; and pull it out quite frequently as well.<br />I admit that I'm getting tired of the wacky, effected, &quot;telephone&quot; vocals.  Please, James, just sing.  And where's John Myung?  The stuff he's done with Ty Tabor is inspiring, and I want more from him in DT's sound.  He's there, mopping the floor, but not shining.<br />These guys seem to be suffering from the same &quot;we can do it ourselves&quot; disease that has ravaged King's X (my personal faves) in recent years.  I respect all of you as musicians, and you all have moved me at various times.  That said, please, please(!), get new producers for your next projects.  Someone NOT in the band!

0385504209|5.0|I love learning about the subject discussed in Da Vinci Code.  This is definetely a typical page-turner/suspense filled book, but the setting and plot that is packed in here makes it a step above the rest.  I bought the book, read it, and passed it on to many other people in my family.  They, too, enjoyed it as much as I did.
0440241413|4.0|I'm now pretty much sick and tired of Chick Lit, but for those of you aren't yet: if you're looking for a bit of light reading, try this book. Rebecca, &quot;Becky,&quot; Bloomwood is the professed shopaholic, and she is a bloody nutter. She does stupid things, i.e. borrow money from a virtual stranger so that she can buy a scarf, and lie on her resume about speaking Finnish (?!) fluently. That said, she also possesses a certain charm. I laughed out loud at a couple of her escapades. Few people (I hope) are as pathetic with money as her, but we all have our moments, right? Anyway, if you don't think you can empathize with her insanity even a little, don't waste your money on this book. If you can, it's a worthwhile read. (If you can but are broke, borrow it from a friend or the library.)
0156027321|2.0|I found this tale to be an interesting and believable tale, up to about 3/4th of the way thru the book.  Then it became unbelievable, and quite frankly, stupid.  The ending was particularly poor.

B0000648WZ|1.0|&quot;What was that?&quot;  My exact words after leaving the theater after sitting through Starship Troopers.  I don't know if the writers actually read the book, or just pulled a few character names out and threw something together after reading the back.<br />  Sure, if I hadn't read the book, this would have been a fine action movie, but I ruined it for myself and read Starship Troopers before seeing the movie.  Whereas the book can be set alongside the same lines as &quot;All Quiet on The Western Front,&quot; with feelings of nationalism and the &quot;War is Hell&quot; oddessy; the movie pretty much was Rambo with a bigger cast.<br />  If you're looking for a decent action movie, this is it.  However if you've read the book...you are in for a REAL dissapointment.  If you want a less tacky &quot;War is Hell&quot; I'll recremend &quot;All Quiet on The Western Front,&quot; better script...I can't say anything about the actors because I'm sure they did the best they could with the materiel they had.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It is impossible to understate the beauty and refined elegance of this magnificent CD. The lyrics and styling harken to a simpler day when music was more beautiful and less violent. Not a caustic or belligerant track to be fonud.<br />Norah's melifluous voice floats across the air with whimsy and youthful verve. Its plush and sanguine..the arraingements are curious and gifted..each song presented like a fine jewel in a solid gold crown of the best craftsmanship.<br />Her music is both relaxing and envigorating..its both throw-back and progressive. Its solid,  sincere and tantilizing. Its music to make love by, music to wax nostalgic.<br />Norah Jones has given me faith that wonderful music  and &quot;old standards&quot; can be made today..GET THIS CD!
0688170528|5.0|Assuming that this was another \\"chick novel\\", I would not have ordinarily picked this book to read. But since a friend had recommended it to me, I dived into it with low expectations. As I read, I became increasingly engrossed with the realistically-drawn characters and well-crafted plot. The novel is great for book discussion groups as it raises lots of questions: Can the legal system ever adjudicate the real truth, or is truth so relative that it can never be legally defined? Can one give onself over to another too completely? Is suicide ever a reasonable answer to life's challenges? This book is indeed a \\"chick novel\\" in the sense that it is primarily about interpersonal relationships. But it is more than just a light, entertaining read. Those who appreciated the movie \\"Ordinary People\\" will find in this novel a similarly sophisticated treatment of the despair that can attend adolescence and the impact it can have on families and communities.
1891252089|5.0|I recently started practicing The Primary Series, and although there are some really good books out there (Julie Pegram, Berly Bender Birch, Richard Freeman, etc.) I must say this is the best.  This book gives a lot of what alot of the other books give (History, Sanskrit Terminology, The entire Primary Series, some or all of the Intermediate Series, modifications to postures, etc.), but this book goes a little beyond.  A prime example of this concept is the abbreviated workouts (aka &quot;Short Forms&quot;).  The Short Forms range from 15-45 minutes.  I can speak from personal experience on how well even a 15 minute Short Form can improve your overall wellness.  In addition David Swenson's breaking down of how to properly perform a half vinyasa (the Up Dog, Down Dog, jump through after every seated posture) is unparalled, a very detailed step-by-step analysis that makes this impossible display of dexterity seem attainable.  Any person with at least a base understanding of Ashtanga Yoga, or Yoga in general, could benefit from this book.  In fact, anybody interested in developing an at home practice could benefit from what this book has to offer.  What else can I say, this book is really that good.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Luckily, I had the good fortune of listening to the entire album on the MTV website before I had the chance to purchase this album and thank God I did!!!  Britney claims that this album is a reflection of her own personal growth and maturity but what she really means is, I'm legal now so I can talk about sex (...)all I want to!  The subject matter of the album is all about staying out late, partying at clubs and sex.  And while I'm not dissing these things, there is a lot more to life and I'm sure there is a lot more to Britney, but she is sure as heck not going to show it with the exception of the song, \\"Everytime\\".  Aside from the subject matter on the CD, the actual music is pretty bad.  The beats tend to drone on and on and her voice is weak, nasally and baby-like (but this is nothing new!) There is no real stand out song on this album and strangely enough my favorite song was \\"Everytime\\", the only ballad on the whole CD (although as I listened to this song I kept thinking how Christina, Jessica or Mariah could have done much more justice to this song!)  If you like pop, I would suggest buying Alicia Key's or Nelly Furtado's new CD instead of this one.  These are two young women who can sing, play their own instruments and address a range of subjects in their songs.

B0000C6E4D|2.0|I wanted to listen to this album many times before I offered a review, since Surfacing took quite a few listens for me to appreciate its finer points.  Alas, while Surfacing brought me fully around after digesting it, Afterglow simply hasn't.<br />To be fair, there aren't many totally bad songs on this album.  The notable exception to me is Push.  This song should have been left off of the album; it should have been buried in a closet and forgotten.  Someone here described it as saccharine and embarassing.  I don't really have anything to add to that.  On the flip side of that, I find my favorite track to be Answer, not for any greatness of the track, but for the emotions it evokes.  Of course, they nearly ruined it with completely out-of-place percussion, but those parts are short and unobtrusive enough to ignore.<br />I guess, overall, I find the album listenable.  But it's lyrically weak, and musically lacking.  What's more, there were some really bad musical and production decisions made on more than one track.  It's also short, given the quality of the material that was actually chosen to be on the album.<br />For Sarah, it's mediocre.  I expected more, and I believe it's fair to have done so.  It's been, what, six years since Surfacing?  Sarah is better than this album.
0156027321|4.0|I found the book to be an ode to survival in all its forms which is often and necessarily fraught with grisliness and gore.  To endure the psychological devastation alone inspired awe.  To endure the physical torments which is beyond even the imagining of most was nothing less than heroic.  Pi is drawn as a very likable person who makes strong arguments for the captivity of animals in zoos.  He is a vegetarian because his family follows the vegetarian tradition of Hinduism.  Also, he has devoted himself to three divergent religions which I particularly liked about him.<br />Is Pi's story compelling enough to change people's opinions of zoology, not eating meat, or the existence of God?  Probably not, but if nothing else, it adds depth to the consideration of these issues.

B00006IU73|4.0|Either Wilson's the son of British proggers or he's a genius at assimilating late 60's-early 70's prog influences.  Never mind that the album's serial-killer &quot;concept&quot; isn't filled out very well.  _In Absentia_ pushes plenty of buttons:  it has a whimsical/tortured vocal quality reminiscent of a young Syd Barrett, a sweet melodicism reminiscent of Beatles and early Crimson (&quot;Gravity Eyelids,&quot; &quot;Collapse . . .,&quot;), the edginess of the best prog metal (&quot;Blackest Eyes,&quot; &quot;The Creator . . .&quot;), a psychedelic-pop sensibility reminiscent of Floyd's _Atom Heart Mother_ or _Obscured by Clouds_, the darkness of Sabbath in places, and the trippiness of 70's dead, middle Floyd, or Tangerine Dream.  But this is finally anything but derivative music.  Perhaps the key to originality in our or any culture is the ability to assimilate a huge amount of material and still come up with something of your own.  Wilson is an ace at synthesizing past and present musics and, with the help of some very professional musicianship (Barbieri, Edwin, Harrison, his own), creating a genuine musical statement that seems to stand apart.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw \\"Firefly\\" when it was aired on Fox.  I knew it was there.  I WANTED to see it (Joss Whedon is an amazing amazing creator of stories), but never got around to.  Then a friend of mine showed me an episode.  Then a second..  long story short, I own the DVDs now.<br />We all know the storyline and how well the writers crafted a space western, but it's the characters of Firefly that make this show as top notch as it is.  Every actor has developed a person who is unique, who breathes on the screen, who brings life to the stories.  And, really, isn't that what we want in our TV and movies - characters whose stories and their endings are important to us because we care?  Someone else mentioned \\"Star Wars\\" and how the prequels sucked.  Why?  Because no one cared about the characters.<br />The writers of Firefly have also created a unique culture of the future, even down the nuances of language.  The intermittent use of Chinese which flows naturally into conversations (watch it with the CC on, there are NO translations..  everyone has to use context to figure out what's being said.  Brilliant!) and the vocabulary - \\"a reader\\" for \\"psychic\\", \\"sly\\" for \\"gay\\", \\"shepherd\\" for \\"priest\\" - create an environment that is alien and yet familiar.  We are disoriented because we are forced to wade through their culture and make a place for oureselves there.  Luckily, there are enough welcoming images that it's easy to get comfoprtable and start enjoying.  <br />Joss Whedon and his team made a product that I shamefully ignored, and that got cancelled before its time.<br />Hopefully, we'll get that movie soon.
0061040967|5.0|At the end of &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, the last book to feature Cohen the Barbarian and the Silver Horde, the decrepit warriors had conquered the Agatean Empire. Unfortunately, and not very surprisingly, it seems they got a little bored.  Remembering that a hero should die in battle, they have now decided to pick the right enemies and attack Dunmanifestin. To put it another way, a band of very old barbarians led by the world's greatest hero are going to invade the Discworld's Home of the Gods and blow it up. They've even brought along a bard to write the saga of their last, greatest and most glorious assault.<br />Unsurprisingly, word of this latest development has reached the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork. This news has caused no little amount of panic, as the destruction of Dunmanifestin and the Gods will lead to the end of the world. So, as the Gods sit back, throw dice and have some fun, Lord Vetinari sends out a team to try and stop Cohen and his cohorts. Supported by the head wizards of the Unseen University - including the newly appointed Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic, Ponder Stibbons - Rincewind, Leonard of Quirm, Captain Carrot and a certain hairy stowaway take a trip few Ankh-Morporkians have ever taken.<br />While &quot;The Last Hero&quot; may be shorter than most of the Discworld novels, it's still well worth reading. The new \\"villain\\" Evil Harry Dread, The Evil Dark Lord, would be an asset to any future book and Paul Kidby's illustrations are a superb addition. While it may be better to have read a couple of the Discworld books previous to this -just to \\"know\\" the characters a little better -  I'm not sure it would be any great disadvantage if you hadn't. Pratchett's books are simply fantastic, and this matches anything he has written.
0066214122|3.0|This was a mildly enjoyable read, but certainly not compelling or breathtaking story (as the flap synopsis would have you believe).  The plot is contrived, the characters are not well developed, and there are character imponderables not explained.  There is suspense and a fast pace, but they are not well molded.  And while there is a plot twist towards the end that is interesting, the story ends abruptly, like a steam engine that just runs out of heat.  Not what you would expect from someone of Crichton's caliber.<br />The story revolves around a nanotechnology project in the Nevada desert.  A small research firm is working a Department of Defense contract to develop a battlefield intelligence-gathering system based on a cloud of nanocomponents.  These would act in concert, forming a composite lens and communications system that would have a high degree of survivability against conventional enemy countermeasures.  To complicate things, \\"The nanoparticles in the cloud had to be endowed with a rudimentary intelligence, so that they could interface with each other to form a flock that wheeled in the air.\\" (pg. 125)  The flocking capability would enhance usefulness as well as survivability.  Unfortunately emergence theory came into play during testing and development, which led to rapid evolution towards self-awareness and a survival instinct.  <br />Crichton does a reasonable job of explaining the technical basis underlying the plot.  He takes us through nanotechnology, artificial distributed intelligence, flocking behavior, and so forth.  This is what saves the book.  It's worth reading, but really only for the science in it.
B000006SGT|5.0|There are many Animals compilations out there, some of which are good and others that are awful, but this one is quite possibly the best one.  By getting this compilation you are essentially getting the band's first two albums, \\"The Animals\\" and \\"Animal Tracks\\" and a whole bunch of bonus tracks at a fraction of the cost of getting all the material seperately.<BR>Considering the remastering job is from 1990, the sound quality is impressive.  Many other compilations have poorly transferred versions of these songs.  The sound quality sets apart the Animals stylistically from their other British counterparts (the Kinks, the Who, the Yardbirds).  The vocals and drums are especially clear, while the keyboard parts waver a bit here and there and the guitar is mixed up pretty high in places.  Nothing that bothered me, however (I can accept the distortion on the last note of House of the Rising Sun).<BR>The tracks here include every legitimate recording produced by Mickie Most and original keyboard player Alan Price is present on every single track with the exception of \\"It's My Life\\" - which is done by a Price-less lineup (no pun intended).  Almost every song is a cover version; original material was not the Animals strong suit at this time.  Stuff like \\"Inside Looking Out\\" and \\"See See Rider\\" are not present here because this collection focuses exclusively on the Mickie Most recordings instead of overextending itself by attempting a truly \\"complete\\" collection.<BR>Almost immediately after the last session featured on this compilation the band would head for new creative fields with new personnel in tow.  Two years later, the Animals would be a completely different band with the exception of singer Eric Burdon.  For those who choose to continue the story of the Animals (and you should), track down \\"Animalisms\\" (\\"Animalization\\" was the US title), and the confusingly titled \\"Animalism\\" which is actually a wholly different album featuring new drummer Barry Jenkins.  Some of the later material is nearly impossible to find on CD, but it's out there.  Hopefully somebody will wise up and give a similar treatment to the later years of the Animals that this compilation has done with the band's first two years.<BR>(Addendum: You get the full length versions of every song.  No single-edit hackjobs to be found here!)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is by far one of the best that have come out in recent history. It has good story, character that are well rounded, very well cast and strangly believable. It puts a remarkably human twist on the space frontier.  I wish I had seen it during it run, and that it will continue.
B0000AWEL8|5.0|****************************************************************<BR>There is [and undoubtedly will continue to be] a fair degree of criticism of this album.<BR>It has been deemed to be too 'repetitive', 'dull' and 'boring'. <br />Such broad, sweeping charges should cause us to cast a more discerning and critical<BR>eye on both this and other Kraftwerk projects. Take for example, 'Trans Europa Express'<BR>[the German version]. On that album there are 3 sequential variations of the title track;<BR>and the last track offers a brief variation or 'reprise' of the first. Again, two tracks on one<BR>of the most influential concept albums of all time are variants on a singular general theme -<BR>'Computer World' and 'Computerworld 2'. Are you aware that the word 'Computer'<BR> appears in 4 of the 7 track titles; and another includes the word 'Compute'. But this fact<BR> does nothing to demote the undisputed important landmark classic status of the whole. <br />If you look and listen hard enough then you will also discover that these conceptual <BR>developmental themes are not uncommon in the classical music world either. So it<BR>should come as no great surprise to find two classically trained musicians namely -<BR>Ralph Hutter and Florian Schneider - composing alternate and similar formations of<BR>musical scores. Therefore, TDF soundtracks contains character traits in common with<BR>the aforementioned titles, because although thematically and musically some of the tracks<BR>appear the same, there are in them some notable differences in both sound and musical<BR>arrangements. <br />To cast off TDF Soundtracks as dull, repetitive and boring after one or two hearings is a<BR>very valid but equally unfair critical misunderstanding of what I consider to be great originality.<BR>The album attempts to convey to us the overall grandeur and excitement associated with<BR>participating in the Tour De France. There is also a sense in which the length, variation<BR>and merging of thetracks [especially 2-5] actually serves to convey both the overall fluidity<BR>of the race, and the huge distances and challenges that each participating cyclist must endure<BR>throughout. <br />From the outset, the TDF Soundtracks 2003 takes us to the starting line of this famous<BR>cycling competition. The 'prologue' is if you like, an opening push into the start of the race.<BR>And if you have ever ridden a bicycle, then maybe you will appreciate the gradual transition<BR>from a stationary position to a smooth progression of pace as you work through the lower<BR>gears. Imagine as you listen through the TDF variations, the enthusiastic exhilaration of<BR>peddling along roads, around mountains, through villages and countryside; speeding up;<BR>slowing down; controlled breathing. Consider the physical exertion associated with a hill<BR>climb - and as a result both feeling and hearing the heartbeat pounding in your mouth;<BR>sweating, dehydrating and drinking juice from a bottle. Consider the joy, the pain -<BR>the competitive strain - the freedom! It actually works very well, even more so for the<BR>initiated. <br />There are a few hidden, distant musical shades of 'Computer World' and other works<BR>throughout the whole adventure, and although sometimes very subtle they are well<BR>worth listening out for. There is a clever, genial simplicity in many of the lyrical scores -<BR>which certainly only Kraftwerk could produce - alongside some truly refreshing musical<BR>brilliance. 'Vitamin' and 'Aero Dynamik' are beautifully crafted, and their meaning <BR>and connection to the main theme should be plain, even to a glancing non-participant.<BR>The heart beating introduction and overall rhythm in 'Elektro kardiogramm' is quite<BR>simply and truly breathtaking. 'La Forme' opens with a quiet solo rhythmic beat which<BR>bursts into a bright electronic crescendo of sound, almost as if you can see beyond the<BR>pain barriers and gruelling exercises of the event, towards the finishing line ahead in<BR>the distance. \\"Nearly there; I've almost made it; the yellow shirt is mine for the taking!\\" <br />And what more fitting end, what better and more logically brisk way to complete the<BR>'Tour De France' than with the words \\"Sprint final à l'arrivée\\" from an invigorating new,<BR>soft and subtle variant of the original title song? This is a very special 12th track for fans<BR>who in a sense have waited, not '13' nor even '17' years for the new album [as some say],<BR>but about 20 years. For in my humble opinion, with this crowning glory, 'Techno Pop'<BR>has finally arrived. For just as 'Tour De France' is a track that would have been on the<BR>album that never was; so also like a great consolation, Tour De France Soundtracks is<BR>the finest follow-up concept album that Kraftwerk SHOULD have released next after<BR>Computer World. <br />Put aside for a moment if you will, the negative criticism and enjoy the race -<BR>From 'Start' to 'Finish' TDF Soundtracks is a 'breath of fresh air' for cyclists<BR>and non-cyclists alike! <br />And jolly well worth the long wait!<br />IMPORT BONUS: <BR>As a little extra, the Japanese import version contains a superb CDROM of the accompanying <BR>video to the TDF2003 single. And on the inside of an additional good quality paper lyric sheet<BR> [in Japanese, of course!], is a great poster like advert for the album containing the 4 cyclists in <BR>greyscale -as depicted on the CD cover - along with a track listing with comments in Japanese. <BR>A Kraftwerk collectors item in waiting perhaps?
B00013F35I|5.0|Well, what can you say? I bought this DVD expecting it to be similar to the NYC one. That it isn't. If you're a Springsteen fan, you will already have this. If you are not, go and buy it!!!<BR>This concert is just excellent, even the flaws. (yes, even the boss makes mistakes - check out Bruce forgetting the words to Spirit in the night).<BR>This is just excellent. Pity the star system doesn't allow for 10 star rating because that's what it deserves.<BR>The man is still the BOSS!
B00005B534|5.0|I bought Sanctus Ignis because everyone who was into the same bands as me seemed to enjoy it.  I wasn't disappointed - the album is spectacular.  The influences are pretty apparent (Yngwie, early Symphony X, Bach, and a few more that are listed in the liner notes), but it's a very unique sound.  Excellent musicianship and vocals, the songs are great.  If you like neoclassical metal with a touch of prog, check this out.
0783226845|5.0|This is the best movie of all time Top 10 for sure. The Acting was amazing.Al was at his best best and O'Donnell was good.A must see for any Pacino fan.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Dear Radiohead fans. yes Thom has said he will totally change the Radiohead sound as we all know it. but how.... this album is a last glance at their rock music. the whole band has amazing ability. johnny just came out with a solo album BODYSONG and thom and jonny recently started using some new keyboars in this album. they used an Onde martenot and jonny now has some amazing new synths and a M400 the organ used by the beatles in 'strawberry feilds&quot;. i think their new sound will be closer to a sigur ros sound or more like what they did on KID A with Motion Picture soundtrack, or LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE. but what ever it is it will be good. so keep listening cuz it will only get better.
0312263120|2.0|This book makes me positive that I can work for the NSA. I am working on my resume right now. If people like Susan Fletcher can be the bright star of the NSA, then I know I can work next to her (and help her along when things don't connect inside her head, which was often).<br />I like a protaganist that tries to figure things out. In this book, things just happen to Susan. She doesn't &quot;do&quot; anything. She doesn't use her noodle for anything other than for the male characters to say &quot;oooh, she's pretty&quot; (which happens frequently in this book).<br />The climax was a disaster. I'm not the brightest street lamp on the avenue, but I can usually figure out what's going to happen in a book a little before it happens. But in this book, for the climax, I broke the &quot;code&quot; about 8 pages before the NSA experts broke the code. <br />I also read this after reading The Da Vinci Code, which was much better. As much as reading The Da Vinci Code made me want to read another Dan Brown book, this one makes me NOT want to read another Dan Brown book. <br />Even the cute little &quot;code&quot; on the last page of the book was embarrassingly easy to figure out. Brown should have made *something* in this book challenging for the reader, but instead it's maddening to scream at the characters in the book to make the most obvious connections.<br />It might be true that &quot;WE ARE WATCHING YOU&quot;, but it is also true that &quot;I AM DONE WITH DAN BROWN'S BOOKS&quot;.
B00008OE4W|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was expecting something completely different.  Being a software developer, I was expecting the standard stereotype of eccentric not-in-touch-with-reality radical leftist computer nerds.  What I got instead was a bunch of really fun characters that I thoroughly identified with and who covered the gamut of personality types.  The plot was somewhat believable (the core plot device notwithstanding) and the choices the characters made to come out on top were also fairly enjoyable, such as the sightless gentleman driving the van down a steep embankment to save his buddies with only radioed instructions to keep him on track.  What few persons have mentioned, however, in these reviews is that the movie also has a winning soundtrack.  Its theme is quite catchy and emminently memorable.  Pay no attention to the gentleman who says the movie isn't worth anything.  This movie was meant to be a cut above the rest and it succeeded.  If someone was unable to enjoy it, then I unashamedly chalk it up to his small mind.
B00004RFFI|3.0|&quot;Twister&quot; is a remake of the 1940 Cary Grant/Rosalind Russell classic &quot;His Girl Friday,&quot; with the estranged couple playing tornado-hunting meteorologists instead of aggressive newspaper reporters.  The emphasis of this film, not surprisingly, is more on the special effects than the dynamic between the two leads.  Jami Gertz takes on the role of the &quot;third wheel&quot; in the relationship, the part played by Ralph Bellamy 60 years ago.<br />The special effects are good, and more importantly, it's an entertaining movie.  Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief a few times, but it's worth seeing if you're looking for an interesting diversion that doesn't get too deep.
B0000UJL96|5.0|In 1991 under the brilliant direction of Nicholas Meyer, the last of the \\"Star Trek\\" films was produced that featured the entire cast from the original \\"Star Trek\\" television series, which was originally broadcast between 1966 and 1969 and was the creation of the beloved writer Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991).  This sixth film in the series, entitled \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\", is, in my opinion, one of the best \\"Star Trek\\" films ever produced in large part because of Nicholas Meyer, who had previously directed what is often regarded to be finest \\"Star Trek\\" film ever made, \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn\\".  Also, this film benefited from the writing of Leonard Nimoy (who also portrays Captain Spock), Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal.  The title of the film and some of the film's dialog was quoted directly from William Shakespeare's (1564-1616) immortal play \\"Hamlet\\".<br />This sixth film begins with a horrific explosion on the Klingon moon known as Praxis that resulted from an industrial accident.  Praxis is very nearly destroyed, and the shockwave is felt for many light-years, including by the Federation Starship Excelsior, which is under the command of the promoted Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), who for many years languished as the navigator onboard the Starship Enterprise.  With their home world in jeopardy, the chancellor of the Klingon Empire, Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner), makes the unprecedented decision to establish a peace treaty between the Klingon Empire and the Federation.  Many Federation officers are, of course, highly skeptical of the Klingon's motives, including Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who blames the Klingons for the death of his son (which occurred in the film \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\").  So, when Captain Spock \\"volunteers\\" Captain Kirk to escort the Chancellor Gorkon's ship to Earth, Captain Kirk is more than a little miffed.  However, unforeseen events unfold that allow Captain Kirk and Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999) to be accused of committing a horrific act that threatens the establishment of the peace treaty.<br />Memorable scenes in the film include the explosion on Praxis, the effects to the Excelsior, the Federation meeting, the Enterprise meeting Chancellor Gorkon's ship, the dinner and the events that immediately follow, the trial, the search onboard the Enterprise, Cmdr. Nyota Uhuru (Nichelle Nichols) trying to speak Klingon, the events on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, discussions between Spock and Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall), the battle with General Chang (Christopher Plummer) and the closing scenes.  Other memorable characters include Cmdr. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Capt. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard), Cmdr. Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney), Adm. Cartwright (Brock Peters), the Federation president (Kurtwood Smith), Azetbur (Rosanna DeSoto), Klingon defense attorney Col. Worf (Michael Dorn, of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation fame), Klingon judge (Robert Easton), Klingon commander of Rura Penthe (William Morgan Sheppard) and Martia (Iman).<br />Being the final film featuring the original \\"Star Trek\\" cast, the closing credits are unique by featuring their signatures. \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\" was, without doubt, a very fitting tribute and final farewell to the original cast.  Overall, I rate the film with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Many thanks go to Nicholas Meyer for directing such an excellent \\"Star Trek\\" film, and many thanks go to \\"Star Trek\\" creator Gene Roddenberry for creating such an enduring legacy of stories that will continue to influence science fiction writing for many years to come.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre.  It was so boring that quite a few people in the theatre got up and left in the middle of the movie.  I considered it a challenge to see if I could actually sit through the entire thing.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!  This movie was about as exciting as watching carpet rot.  The acting was excellent, but everything else about the movie dragged.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I had a very enjoyable time listening and reviewing this album. Not one time did I get bored or distracted by something as I have done many times with new records. Lindsey is the shining star of the first half of the CD. Stevie is the over-taker of the second half. <br />Lindsey really broke out to try new and demanding things with his guitar-work, musical instrumentation, arrangements, lyrics, and vocals. With the exception of &quot;Come&quot;, this all seemed to work extremely well for him. This is the best I've ever heard of Lindsey. <br />Stevie wasn't quite as outstanding as Lindsey this time, which is certainly something I've never said before! But before any judgments, take a look at what &quot;outstanding&quot; really means: standing out; conspicuous. By &quot;outstanding&quot; I mean that Lindsey definitely made himself stand out on this record with all his flamboyant new tricks and ideas. This does not mean that Stevie's work doesn't equal the brilliance of Lindsey's. She just achieved the praise by taking a subtler, harder-to-find route. Her brilliance is not as obvious and &quot;outstanding&quot; as Lindsey's. Dig a little deeper here! Stevie's writing is different in that she's a storyteller and an emotion quencher. She uses imagery and riveting words to create images in the listener's mind. For every spectacular and innovative guitar move Lindsey makes, Stevie surpasses it with her gorgeous melodies and vivid use of words. <br />I can't tell you who dominated this record. For the first time I am torn! Stevie has always been my #1 for anything Fleetwood Mac gave us in the past. Now for the first time I have recognized how talented and essential Lindsey is to this band. Without him, Stevie's mystic mood and lyrics would get daunting. Without her, Lindsey would come off sounding arrogant, egotistical, and a baffoon for thinking he could go nuts with his obsession with &quot;new sounds&quot;. These two balance each other out completely. This is why I simply cannot choose. <br />This record is a journey that needs your full attention to really appreciate, even if that means listening to it again and again and again...and again, again, again. I'm so proud of Fleetwood Mac. With the addition of Buckingham and Nicks in 1975, this band has been going strong for 35 years [Just nevermind the long breaks, as I like to call them]. Even without Christine, Fleetwood Mac is still Fleetwood Mac. As long as Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are there to keep things grounded, Fleetwood Mac will always be Fleetwood Mac. GO LISTEN TO THIS AMAZING BAND!! NOW!! I don't care if &quot;Don't Stop&quot; ruined it all for you when Clinton decided to use it as the theme for his whole damn campaign. Some things just need to be forgiven and forgotten. <br />****1/2
0440237688|5.0|This is a completly original story that hasn't been though from a writer in ages. Lois created a utopia in the life of perfect. But, is the life of perfect worth many sacrifices? Without pleasure or serious pain, is life really life? With this, Lois played the role of God, made a world, and slowly observe from one character to add life slowly into life. Five stars for him!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This CD is perfect. All the hits are there plus the mesmerizing &quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Go Insane&quot;, and &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; from 97's The Dance. <br />I wanted this CD first for the enhanced goodies. I popped the disk in my computer on Christmas Day and got nothing but a page that &quot;cannot be found&quot; when clicking for the Vaults. If anyone is having this same problem or knows what to do, please contact me: reginafilangie88@aol.com.
0151008116|5.0|I found this book at borders one day and read the summary of it. Yes, it was hilarious at some part of the story and sooner it came into a more serious plot. The story is so intense that it like a survival of the fittest, except add a ocean and the boat and the tiger. What grab me was the Tiger, I love tigers, they dumbfound me. You need to read the book all the way to the end, if you don't, then your missing out. The end is a really twisted something.
0446608955|5.0|When I first saw the movie, I wanted to watch it again and again. For Christmas I got &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; DVD along with the book by Nicholas Sparks. (So far I've seen it nine times.) I read the book and it truly was the best book I've ever read. It inspires me, it taught me to apperciate life more, and not to take anything for granted. After reading &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, I immediatley wanted to read all of Mr. Sparks books! I just love this one and it will be the one I tell my kids, grandkids, etc. I totally recommed this book to anyone!
B000002UVX|4.0|I remember when this lp first came out; my baby-sitter used to play it on the stereo all the time. So nice to hear it mastered on CD. 'Band Of Gypsys' is a 6 song / 45 minute live performance that was recorded on New Year's Eve 1969-70. It's line-up is not to be missed: Hendrix on guitar & vocals, Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums. I specially dug &#34;Who Knows&#34;, the nicely flowing &#34;Power Of Love&#34;, and the two Miles compositions &#34;Changes&#34; and &#34;We Gotta Live Together&#34;. If anything, this disc -proves- there'll never be another Hendrix. A really memorable listening experience.
B000084T18|1.0|This is some of the worst rapping I've ever heard. Honestly. The rhymes are kindergarten level, and he sounds like he is trying to rap with a mouth full of ice cubes. The beats aren't all that great either. Do yourself a favor and buy an album from a rapper who can rap.
B000002H33|5.0|This is a great CD. I am a HUGE Metallica fan and to me this is there second best CD behind ....And Justice For All. Battery kicks the CD off and the song really gets ya pumped up when you hear those fast guitar riffs and with James on vocals it just adds to the experience. My favorite song on the CD would have to be Battery. Metallica really let loose on this album and didn't hold anything back. Although i was dissapointed with the track (The Thing That Should Not Be) because it is very slow and you can't really get into. This CD really kicks ass and i suggest you purchase it.
0440180295|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful. In words, ideas, in character, sad, pensive, beautiful. Billy Pilgrim is the aloof soundboard through which the readers uniquely experience (and Vonnegut expresses) the firebombing of Dresden and the comical tragedies of war. <br />I repeated the word \\"beautiful\\" because Vonnegut's diction is so simple and transparent like a clear crystal. He has a gift for depicting the fantastic with what is fantastic. For instance, the implicit tragedy of horrendous Dresden burning is counterbalanced by the preceding hilarity of English prisoners of war, and the fantastical abduction of Billy by aliens. Yet, uses the resulting mental jolts to emphasize the tragedy of the war, rather than debase the topic into a light farce.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|To date, 350+ positive reviews out of 362 total reviews have been written about this show, now out on DVD.  There's little I can add to what other people have written so specifically about how excellent this show is, except the following:<br />From the reviews of Firefly here it is clear that this show has had a significant impact despite its short exposure on TV.  What you can do if you like the show, and are an Amazon.com customer, is go to other products and recommend Firefly in addition to/instead of that other product, as long as there is some relevancy.  You'll need Firefly's ASIN#, which is B0000AQS0F.<br />And if you've already bought the DVD and want to support the show further, buy the DVD set as a gift to others, or as a gift to your local library, etc...  There's even one internet site, fireflymovie, raising money to buy copies to send to U.S. troops around the world.  Any way you do it, it makes a great gift.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This is one of the best,if not the best Wu-Tang member solo project.GZA is obviously one of the more underated Wu members and goes all out on this CD. A must have for any Wu fan.<br />My highest recomendation goes to this cd.<BR>* Chexk out &quot;Swordsman&quot; it's an amazing song.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This Cd is off tha chain! Alicia has taken soul music to a whole nother level. You can't compare Songs In A Minor to this CD, because they are very different from each other. You can see how the things she's experienced and the other cultures that she's been influenced by shine through this cd. Alicia's vocals are a lot stronger and the songs on here are on fiyah. My favorite songs from this album are Diary, If I Ain't Got You, If I Was Your Woman, Karma, and You Don't Know My Name.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Anyone who gave this CD obviously doesnt respesct hip hop in one of its purest forms. All tracks deliver pure satisfaction and Its another must have wu clan member must have<br />WU TANG FOREVER
B0000DD7LB|1.0|OK, someone should tell her that her &quot;sell-by&quot; date has expired. This album is utter trash! If she's smart, she'll peel off another layer of clothing to continue masking the fact that, like her new friend Madonna, she cannot sing but sure does look good half-naked!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I looked forward to 2 albums last year, this one and Metallica's St.Anger. I have to tell you this one was a masterpiece, and St.Anger was a dissapointment. Billy and Maynard picked great musicians to back them up(Smasing Pumpkin's James Iha, Marilyn Manson's Jeordie White or commonly known as Twiggy Ramirez, and Josh Freese)this was a remarkable album, I especially liked The Package and Halo. Also there is a Tool album due out this year and when it comes out I suggest you buy that too.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought this album for my niece, not really wanting to, but when she played this CD on Christmas (and during the subsequent days following) I realized my money was well spent. The girl has an enormous, flawless voice and it really shines through on a few select songs. Songs like \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Loving Me for Me\\" really helped me understand that this girl doesn't belong in the pop genre from which she came and that her voice is so much more mature than any of her peers. Now if only someone would tell her that she doesn't have to dress like a street walker. She doesn't have to hide behind synthesizers, vocoders nor does she have to waste everyone's time by coming out onstage and lip-synching! She has way too much talent to sell herself out like that.

Cant get any better then that. A while back, I purchased S&H on VHS thru Colombia House. They are great, but nothing beats seeing the candy apple red Ford Grand Torino tearing up the streets in digital format. Awesome, cant wait. I have been waiting a long time for this. Finally....
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is a pure and simple &quot;monster movie&quot; and it does quite well what it sets out to do: scare you with ideas and imagery that monsters do indeed exist and that you ought not go poking around where they live.<br />Overall, if you appreciate monster movies like Creature from the Black Lagoon, Gargoyles, The Wolfman, The Relic, The Thing, Pumpkinhead, et al, then you'll most likely enjoy Jeepers Creepers.<br />On the other hand, if you get easily hung-up on minor plot quibbles or if you're looking for a &quot;teen slasher&quot; or, most importantly, if you have trouble suspending disbelief (&quot;This movie is stupid--there's no such thing as monsters!!&quot;) then you may want to look elsewhere for your scares.<br />In a nutshell, Jeepers Creepers is about a monster that lives in an old, abandoned church in the countryside. Every now and then it gets to come out and feed upon locals and unlucky motorists travelling along the road which happens to run right past its lair. Fortunately for us, a pair of college students are on their way home and have decided to take the scenic route....
0553277472|5.0|Pirsig's ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE and Kerouac's ON THE ROAD inspired me to hit the highways in this great country.  I camped around the U.S. for several months, spent time with people from all walks of life.  Along the way, I helped others and others helped me.  Pirsig's book encourages healthy introspection, while Kerouac's book promotes extroverted self-exploration.  Regardless of your age, if you are independent, read these books and hit the road.  You will be delighted with what you discover about yourself and reassured in what you experience with others.  When you get home...write about your experiences...there may be a book in there somewhere. Robert John Estko - author of the suspense thriller, EVIL, BE GONE (available on Amazon.com)
0800196767|5.0|&quot;Matilda&quot; is a must-watch for anyone with a sweet-tooth for funny movies (like, for instance, myself).  The adaptation, while perhaps not entirely faithful to Roald Dahl's book, works perfectly.  The screenwriter(s?), whose name(s) I unfortunately cannot remember, did a superb job of turning Harry and Zinnia Wormwood from British idiots to American idiots.<br />The acting is great from all parties.  Real-life couple Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman are the perfect Harry and Zinnia (which I mean as a compliment...).  The title role is well portrayed by Mara Wilson, and by Sara Magdalin as the younger Matilda.  Embeth Davidtz is the ideal Miss Honey, and Pam Ferris is unforgettable as The Trunchbull.<br />I've seen several film adaptations of Roald Dahl stories - &quot;The Witches&quot; and &quot;The BFG&quot; to name a couple - but this is by far the best one, and you will more than likely want to watch it lots of times.
B00000JPH6|3.0|I bought this DVD off ebay a year or so ago, I was so happy to get it since it was a movie I cherished when I was a child. The only problem is I'm not a child anymore, the movie didn't do for me today what it did years ago, it was hard for me to follow the story. Most of the characters seem creepy now, and I couldn't make head or tails of what most of the characters were saying, although I remember everything making perfect sense to me when I was a child. It kind of makes me wish I would have left it in my memories as this wonderful visualy stunning movie I remembered from my childhood, rather than the way I view it now as an adult.
0385504209|2.0|I rarely read books with so much media hype surrounding them, but the premise of this book piqued my interest. As an art lover and a spiritual person, I was looking forward to an interesting read.<br />I was incredibly disappointed.<br />I hope no one finds offense in this next statement, but this book was written for the masses.  The writing is... obvious. No thinking required. It's a good book to take on vacation, or to read while on break from grad school, like I am. It is not an intellectual endeavor, by any means! With that said, it was certainly entertaining, and I'm wondering if the movie is already in the works. Robert Langdon is likened to Harrison Ford early in the story, and I don't think this was an accident. The reader is stuck with the mental image of Ford as Langdon. (not such a bad thing, of course, but it adds to the Hollywood movie feel of the book!)<br />The potential in this book is endless, and I believe it could have been a masterpiece.  Sadly, the claims on the jacket are simply hype... Nelson DeMille claims the work of &quot;pure genius&quot; lies within the pages of this book, but I fail to see it!<br />Every single symbol is explained and explained again, in case you forgot the first explanation. This certainly takes the fun out of symbolism, if you ask me. Every chapter is written with this cliffhanger, Hollywood-esque style, which keeps you turning pages in the beginning but gets tiresome after a while.<br />I love the theories surrounding the Holy Grail and Mary Magdalene, and I find the beliefs in the sacred feminine incredibly intriguing. I find it funny when devout Roman Catholics denounce this fictional book as heresy... these closed-minded reviews just add to the controversy and help support opposing theories. In my opinion, Roman Catholicism is the nuttiest and most corrupt religion out there.  More people should examine the ancient beliefs in the sacred feminine, something that has been sadly eradicated from the Catholic Church. This idealogy is explored in The da Vinci Code, and I found the history quite interesting.<br />One last thing, in response to some of the reviews I've read - it's difficult to take people's reviews seriously when they can't even keep the story straight. Sophie Neveu was Sauniere's granddaughter in the book, not his daughter, as I have read too many people say.  It's an important detail, as the reader finds at the very end of the story. Speaking of the end, that was my favorite part of the book. I saw it coming and was annoyed to have the writer present it as such an amazing revelation, but Sophie's reunion with her family members help tie the story together and add a little depth to otherwise incredibly shallow characters. The end was also my favorite part of the book because, well, I could finally stop reading it! Throughout the story, I kept waiting for Brown to redeem himself as a writer but it never happened.<br />All in all, I feel it could have been a great book but it was mediocre at best. Some of the historical stories and symbols have grabbed my attention though, and I look forward to reading more about these intriguing topics.This idealogy is explored in The da Vinci Code, and I found the history quite interesting. <br />One last thing, in response to some of the reviews I've read - it's difficult to take people's reviews seriously when they can't even keep the story straight.

0783117523|4.0|&quot;Gia&quot; is quite simply the haunting but well told story of Gia Marie Carangi.  Truth be told, I was not drawn to this movie at first because of the story, what drew me and I'm sure many others to it is the star Angelina Jolie.  After her success in the Tomb Raider movies, I thought it would be interesting to see some of her past work, thus this movie became very interesting!<br />Angelina Jolie performs admirably and brilliantly in this film, almost to perfection in what I'm sure is an even greater range in her talents.  The depth of the character she portrays does compel you to the character despite already knowing the tragic outcome.  Praise goes to Faye Dunaway and Mercedes Ruehl for their efforts in this film as well.<br />This true life sad story is told well in the film; however, the director, Michael Cristofer, chose an almost cryptic style in which to tell the tragic story of Gia's life which, at times, detracts from the overall telling of the story.  The score for the film does do well in what it's designed to do, augment the overall feel of the movie.<br />The Premise:<br />&quot;Gia&quot; is the overly tragic story of Gia Marie Carangi; a young and extremely beautiful woman from Philadelphia who suffered the break up of her parents at a young age and then in her late teens, a photographer stumbles upon her and not long thereafter the life of a supermodel overwhelms her.  Incapable of dealing with separation of any form, she turns to drugs!<br />What follows from there is a heart wrenching and very telling true life tragedy of what happened to this beautiful young woman.<br />I would definitely recommend this HBO movie; one for the story itself and two for the exceptional performance by Angelina Jolie in this heartrending tale.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Cast &amp; Crew Bios<BR>-Photo Gallery
0393317552|1.0|I was recently assigned by my professor to read &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; by Jared Diamond.  My classmates informed me that the book leaned to the boring side, as I expected an assigned book to be, but aside from boring it was also extremely biased.  Of course its ok for authors to bias their books, but to assign an obviously biased book for reading is completely out of the question.  It was completely anti-west and anti-globalization, as well as regarding Americans in a negative tone.  In one chapter, Diamond rants on about how the primitive new Guineans who still live in huts are in fact smarter than the Europeans who settled North America.  He says that since they can live off the land, they are superior to Americans and Europeans, who cannot.  His thesis is correct, but it stands alone in the category of correctness.  Its bad enough that he uses qualitative analyses (if not completely made up) to base his observations upon, but he goes on and just keeps repeating the same thing over and over again.  It gets even worse:  he rants on for nearly 500 pages.  The only things that kept this horrible book alive were the diagram, because a diagram on a page meant there was no ranting on that page.  Indicated above is my rating: 1 star, but I only put that since there wasn't a space for a 0 stars, which is what I really give it.  Nothing personal, Jared, but why don't you stick to lecturing classes.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Imagine ten characters mostly unknown to each other, and they are trapped in a local motel because of the hard rain falling.  Then suddenly, they start to vanish one after another leaving only a room key numbered 10, 9, 8....  Is this a clue, or a message.  If message, from whom?<br />These travellers include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay.  One is a policeman; another a chauffer; another his employer (and a has-been star).  Inspite of their varied personal background, they seem to have something in common, which is to be revealed sooner or later.         <br />If you are a total stranger to the genre, you might not notice it, but this idea is clearly borrowed from Agatha Christie novels.  But &quot;Identity&quot; gives an unexpected twist ... which is provided by the 11th character.  That is a crucial point, but some of you will detect the plot device, one of the pivotical point of &quot;Identity,&quot; in the middle of the story.  If so, just keep on watching, because another big surprise is waiting for you.<br />And that is also the weakness of the film, too.  As the plot unravels, the mysterious atmosphere gets thinner.  That is inevitable, considering the nature of the film.   Still, if you see the opening of the film which has a tense, sinister feeling all around, you might well regret the loss of it.  <br />Director James Mangold's foray into thriller is pretty successful, even though what he does is actually recycled from old classic films of the genre.  But he does it very competently, and it is certain that you get thrills especially from the first part of the film. <br />But the most memorable contribution to &quot;Identity&quot; is done from its production designer Mark Friedberg and its photographer Phedon Papamichael.  And like his previous &quot;Girl, Interrupted,&quot; James Mangold is endowed with talented cast.  Kudos to these great cast and crew, and &quot;Identity&quot; is a fairly good thriller though we ALMOST want to see it again to check in this motel.  Shame that there is no Norman here.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|Science fiction suffers from a lack of sound and color.  I love old sf films -- but I have to agree with Stanley Kubrick (as quoted by Arthur C. Clarke in The Making of 2001 -- A Space Odyssey).  Most science fiction before 2001 -- A Space Odyssey is awful.  My love of Metropolis and Things to Come and Destination Moon is a result of nostalgia -- an 80 year old man may still love an 80 year old woman, but he can hardly expect a young man to see her in the same light.  The only reason for a young person to watch old (pre-Kubrick) sf films is to learn about the history of the science fiction film.  If you do want to learn about the history of film sf, Metropolis is the place to start, and despite some valid and informative objections from purists, this version comes the closest to making sense.
0786867973|4.0|I received this book as a Christmas present one year ago, because I had recently begun to develop an interest in cooking.  I am a college student with little &quot;true&quot; cooking experience, however I found this book to be fairly easy to follow and have had a lot of success with the recipes I have tried so far.  I would describe this book as &quot;beginner gourmet&quot; in that some of the recipes are a bit fancy and require longer preparation time, yet others are easier and simpler to make.  Today I made the London cheesecake, which turned out to be incredible.  I have made the Espresso cupcakes several times of which they have always turned out really well.  The Molten Chocolate Babycakes was the very first recipe I made from this book, which was also very good (highly recommend for chocolate lovers).  I had a bit of difficulty with the cheese blintzes because they were pretty tedious for an inexperienced cook to make; however for a first try they did turn out pretty good.  In the future I would love to make the peanut butter/chocolate squares, the rocky road and the easy almond cake. This book contains several full color photographs of the recipes, which helps me know what the recipes are supposed to look like.  The book is well organized into sections such as; chocolate, children (contains simpler recipes such as cupcakes, birthday cake, the rocky road, etc...)cakes, cookies scones and muffins, bread, Christmas, etc... The only complaint that I have regards the accessability to some of the ingredients in some of the more complicated (yet very appealing) recipes.  For example, I would love to attempt the Torta Alla Gianduia (the photo is a definite seller), however it calls for Nutella, a rich chocolate hazelnut spread of which I do not know where to find it.  I must also mention that while this book focuses on deserts, it is not soley exclusive to them.  There are recipes for bagels, pizza, jam and bread.  Some of the recipes do not sound very appealing to me such as Figs in Rum Syrup, Muscat Jelly (of which I don't know what muscat is), pickled plums, Gin and Tonic Gelatin Mold, and mincemeat pie, but this is purely opinion.  Overall I rate this book as excellent, especially for those of you wishing to learn more about cooking, as well as experienced chefs.  I think this book is a happy medium for people at all levels and I highly recommend it.
B00005JM0B|3.0|The Third Terminator has been creating at the end of 2002, its mean close to Schwarzenegger election for mayor of California. The story line not as good as second Terminator. The story line start with the machine come to current time form the future time to protect John Connor as a leader of Mutineer at the future that will save the world from the dirty Government. In the same time the killing machine T-X (Kristanna Loken) send by dirty government have an obligation to kill Connors.<br />Same with the previous terminator the fighting between two machines one is to protect and the others is to kill Connor. The fighting occur form the various location from the pet clinic to the military base station. Terminator looks like too old to fight with the new model machine. Event finally terminator success to protect Connors but he has to pay with his life.<br />The end of the story Connors and his couple trapped at the US government bunker while the nuclear war occurs.<br />The Schwarzenegger action too slow in his age its make this movie not so surprise. It's a good for the family entertainment.

B0000DZ3EA|5.0|I can't really fault Peter's focus on his more recent material and virtual exclusion of his first two albums. After all, he is trying to reach a modern audience, and his old stuff, as good as a lot of it is, belongs to a different era, when he was still searching for his identity as an artist (much like with U2's first two LPs). Towards the end of releasing a collection that modern casual listeners can embrace, I think he succeeds. Nearly all of his recognizable radio hits are covered (including &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, finally!), along with strong selections from his newest album and recent side projects. If I were to burn a two disc &quot;intro to PG&quot; set for a friend, my track choices would be nearly the same (aside from the eight or so songs I didn't have in my CD collection). No, it's not a collection that comprehensively covers his whole career, but since this isn't a boxed set, that really isn't the point.<br />For people who are already Peter Gabriel fans, a lot of this collection will probably be redundant, but if you are missing one his more recent albums, like Us or Up, the representative material, along with the previously unreleased or hard-to-find tracks (which I think are all pretty good) may make this collection worth getting for you. I can't comment on the remixed tracks vs. the originals, since I haven't really done a side-by-side comparison, but the shortened versions worked for me, anyway. The track ordering seems to flow well, too (though, admittedly, I listen more often on &quot;shuffle&quot;).<br />I'm glad this package came out. Hopefully, it will renew interest in this vital and interesting artist as well as bring him some new fans, at a time when it seems like he's rediscovering his creativity. And hopefully that will help inspire Peter himself to not delay his next album for too long!

B000066NW0|5.0|Ummm... why do people even care about their personal attitudes and lives? They're musicians. That's all they do. Make music. So why can't people just shut up and not buy the CD if they don't like it? Please. So what if it's computerized or reformed? If Avril Lavigne's CD sounds great, then buy it! If it doesn't, then don't. Gosh, these people aren't open-minded at all.<br />I personally think that Avril Lavigne has great songs, and yes, I've listened to variety of music, so please don't go saying &quot;I'm just hanging onto a fad&quot;. I'm not. People always go against major people - Queen, as a prime example. Avril Lavigne never claimed herself as a punk, her music sounds great - fresh and new and catchy to me. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that you have to degrade that person completely. <br />If I was talking to a friend, I would recommend her to buy this CD. In a high-traffic and a high-stress community that I live in, this kind of sound is welcome and stress-relieving; it relieves the want of destroying something utterly. <br />People all should focus on what the jobs are.

0446608955|4.0|Nicholas Sparks has never failed me when it comes to his fiction.  I loved this book as I have loved his others.  The feelings between these two teenagers is believable, genuine, and heart-warming.  Don't bother with the movie.  Although Mandy Moore does a good job, the movie is so skewed from the book, its not worth it.  I don't know about other readers, but this had me in tears.
0385504209|1.0|Now HERE is a really bad book, sorry to say, even though it was the best-selling 'mystery' novel of 2003. I'm all for conspiracy theories as a sub-genre, recall being caught up in the Illuminati Trilogy of the 1970s, etc., but this is just over the top. I am not in favor of organized religion of any kind -- it is strictly a personal thing and nobody has the right to condemn or persecute anybody else for whatever they stand for -- but even so I can hardly believe that the Roman Catholic Church has been one giant conspiracy for the past 1000 years, murdering for the sake of suppressing worship of the mother goddess. Yes, there are indeed secret societies, but more along the lines of old-boy networks, Masons, the Bar Associations, Big Business, and the like. And yes, they are out to rip us off. As are politicians, bosses, capitalists, socialists, you name it -- all of those meddlers who think they know how the rest of us should live our lives. But there is nothing Satanic about this, it is just human nature. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is just plain silly, and even its vaunted scholarship is nonsense.<br />As a quick read, it's OK in an improbable way, like the James Bonds, but not halfway as stylish.
B00003CX9W|3.0|Originally conceived as an elaborate Mickey Mouse short (only to blossom into a 2-hour feature film), Fantasia is one of the most ambitious movies ever, animated or otherwise, with its perfect marriage of classical music and animation (something that began with Disney's Silly Symphonies in 1929 and would continue to appear in Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons well after Fantasia's release in 1940). However, the film was a commercial and critical failure for the Disney studio, not picking up steam until the '60s, when it was a popular choice for college students (via 16mm prints) as a &quot;head&quot; film.<br />However, the film hasn't been treated well at all despite being popular for the past 30-40 years. Firstly, the film's dynamic &quot;Fantasound&quot; soundtrack (which was an optical surround-sound soundtrack printed on a separate 35mm reel from the actual video portion of the film) quickly deteriorated, and was eventually transferred to a vastly inferior magnetic tape (which has become garbled as that too has begun to decay). Additionally, Fantasia was re-edited after the initial roadshow version had run its course in an effort to increase the film's popularity with filmgoers in 1940. And finally, the Pastorale Sequence was sloppily edited in the late '60s in order to remove the black centaurettes who serve their white companions.<br />With this in mind, there was much hope in 2000 for a fully restored Fantasia for the film's 60th Anniversary (and the release of the sequel, the excellent Fantasia 2000). Hyped as being fully restored and uncut, it seemed as if Fantasia would finally be seen as it was supposed to be once again.<br />However, the Pastorale sequence remained edited, and the Deems Taylor segments were redubbed by veteran voice actor Corey Burton. While the latter change is understandable (since the audio for the expanded segments has come up missing), the former is quite disturbing, particularly since Fantasia is best viewed in an academic environment-which is also the perfect place to discuss the (thankfully outdated) social stereotypes involved in the Pastorale sequence. Given this editing, it's impossible to ecommend this DVD. However, given that Fantasia is such a vital part of Walt Disney's legacy (and also about to return to the studio vaults until as late as 2010), it's hard to imagine that anyone could hold off from buying this altered version of Fantasia before it gets discontinued.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I purchased this CD a few months ago.  I am a huge Opeth fan, and is one of the few metal bands I will even listen to these days.  First off, this CD will have a few people scratching their heads.  If you are under the assumption that Opeth is a metal band, then this album will confuse you.<BR>  This album is a collection of slow songs.  Gone are power chords and distorted vocals.  The songs on this album utilize clear vocals, with melodic guitars, and mesmorizing baselines.  The excution is perfect.  There is absolutly no evidence of metal in this album.  <BR>  Opeth creates an atmosphere of sandness and doom in this albums.  Its quite ominous from start to finish.  Its the most ideal album to listen to on a rainy day.  My favorite song on this album has to be track 5.  Its very melodic and Mikel Alkerfeldt vocals convey a message of sadness and loss. <BR>   The lyrics are another story.  The album would be perfectly fine as a collection of instrumentals.  While the composition of lyrics stress to you loss and pain, they get tiring after some time.  They certainly aren't the calibur lyrics found in Still Life or Morning Rise.  They often get repetitive, but overall don't distract from the overall perfection of the album.<BR>   Other micellaneous detail of this album is the artwork in the insert and on the cover.  Like Deliverances, it is basically silohoutted rooms with blury images of people.  Its amazing hown the album gives you the atmosphere found on the cover art.  A big thumbs up for Opeth on this one.  Creating artwork that correspond with the mood of the album isn't easy, but they make it look effortless.<BR>   This album is a must buy for any Opeth fan out there.  If you are new to the band, and want to discover them for the first time, then I have two responses.  If you aren't a metal fan, and is a bit leary of a band who goes under the lable of Death Metal, then this album is a perfect starter.  However, if you are a metal fan and want to know what all the fuss is about, I suggest starting with Morning Rise, move into Still Life, and get Blackwater Park.  Those album should be listened to chronologically in the way I instructed.  Either way, Opeth is certainly a thinking man's metal band, and you will do yourself a grave miservice to pass them up
B00003CY6M|5.0|Great movie and good job by the director, but my complaint is where is all the stuff First: director commentary track with peter chelsom. And the deleted seens.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought Gavin's cd based on what I heard on One Tree Hill's theme song. I liked it and spent 10 bucks to get the cd. Wow. The Cd is made up of 11 songs.. and each are great. I was blown away at how fast I got addicted to these songs.The CD starts off with &quot;follow through&quot; and I think it was a great way to start. The song starts off slowly and starts to build up. That worked very well with this song. The lyrics, music, and overall production is perfect. The next 3 songs, &quot;chariot&quot; &quot;Just friends&quot; and &quot;Nice to meet you (anyway)&quot; are all very well produced. It has many similarities in the songs but each has it's on uniqueness too. Chemical Party is very different from those 4 songs because it's more guitar-driven and very raw sounding. Track 8, &quot;i don't want to be&quot; is also a favorite on this cd. It's the One Tree Hill Theme song.. but hearing the full song is so much more powerful than the small clip on tv. &quot;meaning&quot; and &quot;more than anyone&quot; have very good lyrics. the last track &quot; Overrated&quot; fits perfectly as a closer. It's mellow and progresses just like &quot;follow through&quot;.<BR>You should definately check out his cd... It's only like 10 bucks? I bought it without knowing much about his music and I love his cd. Hope this review helps.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I am so tired of &quot;sophisticated&quot; people who refuse to listen to anything &quot;popular or mainstream,&quot; ughh, how can it be quality music if it's not all emo and indie and special, they ask? I find glorious music from the corners of classical to gratuitous hip hop - the genre shouldn't matter, really. My roomates have played this cd enough times for it's suprising rage-rock beauty to fulfill a need in my ears and even - soul! Incubus can sound rageful at first, but who isn't rageful to some extent? Morning view allows you to purge your unhealthy disappointments and gripes ( &quot;...i don't want to talk to you anymore - I'm afraid of what I might say...) and still find hope and wonder through idealistic (but reality based)lyrics and aching melodies. The drummer kicks ass - talk about changing things up. This album is highly satisfying on levels of hard rocking to extreme musical sensitivity.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|::Possible spoilers for those who havent seen RotK::         This soundtrack is absolutely amazing! I have heard a lot of soundtracks and this is the best by far. If you were teary-eyed at the end of Return of the King you will definitely be teary-eyed at the end of the soundtrack. It is the most moving soundtrack I've ever heard. Some of the highlights of it are: #2 (Hope and Memory). This is in Rohan, when Gandalf takes Pippin to Minas Tirith. Number 2 ends with a Shadowfax theme where (in the movie) Gandalf and Pippin are racing through beautiful New Zealand countryside. Also I like the end of #4 (The White Tree). It has the Gondor theme with violins in the backround. In the movie, this is where it shows all the mountains and the beacons being lit. I also like #8 (Twilight and Shadow), which is an Arwen part. The music is really sad in that one. Number 11, Shelob's Lair, is really spooky with many sudden tempo changes. Number 13 (The Fields of Pelennor) sort of goes back to The Prophecy in the FotR soundtrack and shows how the two battles, Dagorlad and the Pelennor Fields, are connected. Number 15 (The Black Gate Opens) goes back and forth between the battle at the Black Gate, and Frodo and Sam on the side of Mount Doom talking about the Shire. #15 leads up to #16, The End of All Things (when the Ring is destroyed), where there are a lot of choral parts. Number 17, The Return of the King, is over 10 minutes long but one of the most beautiful tracks on this cd. It has the crowning and wedding of Aragorn, the part where the hobbits go back and ride past grumpy hobbit, and Sam's and Rosie's wedding. Number 18 (The Grey Havens) is where the elves, Gandalf, Bilbo, and Frodo leave and go to the Undying Lands. It is the saddest, most touching one on here, and puts together a lot of the previous themes from the 3 soundtracks. Those are my favorite ones. I definitely recommend buying this soundtrack.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I credited the limmted edition, at 5 stars, but to cut it short, You Cher MADONNA hater fans need to really back of Madonna.  I like Cher, I stated once and I will state again Madonna put the (D) IN DIVA, No offense to cher or her die hard fans, but face it Madonna is just bigger than Cher. Its took 40 years with long gaps for cher to be where she at (NOW)since 1998. Since then she's been more popular than ever before. Madonna since 1983 has remained huge with out a dout.  WHAT..
B0000AUHOH|2.0|With the record smashing success of Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, Paramount thought it had reached a crossover audience for the Trek franchise, and the studio handed the reigns for the fifth film to William Shatner.  The production started optimistically, but was fraught with cost overruns and delays.<br />From just about any standpoint, this is not a good film. But the problem isn't the directing. William Shatner clearly knows how to handle a camera and draws fine performances from the cast (especially DeForest Kelley).  The problem with Star Trek V centers on the script. There is an old Broadway saying, \\"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.\\" The failure of this movie proves the validity of that truism. Since Shatner is listed as one of the persons behind the story here, he must bear his fair share of the responsibility for the problems with this story. Creating a script about the search for a tangible God, even if it winds up being a false God, sets the viewer up for disappointment. No matter how spectacularly the Almighty is presented on film, it can't live up to the real thing. In this film, He comes across as a latter day Wizard of Oz. Compounded with that are the problems with continuity within the Trek \\"universe,\\" and overall tone: introducing Sybok as Spock's half-brother, and the use of the cast for slapstick humor, do not help an already implausible story. Small wonder Gene Roddenberry did not consider this film to be canonical Trek.<br />The special effects, which are crude and amateurish, do not help matters. The special effects during the original series were often sub-par, yet the old shows continue to satisfy even in today's CGI era. (Anyone with any doubts about that should simply check how well the Original Series DVDs have been selling on Amazon.) Here, the anemic visuals merely add to the problems because they are coupled to a weak script.  About the most charitable thing one can say about this film is that it features a wonderful score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. But that is not enough to save this uninspiring quest.<br />Apparently, for this DVD version William Shatner asked Paramount for additional funding to create a director's edition similar to Robert Wise's edition for Star Trek The Motion Picture, and the visuals would have been addressed here.  Paramount turned him down, and his commentary track (with his daughter) only emphasizes that that 15 years later, Shatner still doesn't get it.  The problem with this film is not the special effects (bad as they are), it's the script.  No amount of GCI can fix groan inducing moments like Scotty bumping into a bulkhead or the bathroom humor.<br /><br />The DVD special collectors edition has a few interesting features.  Most significant are the deleted scenes, and the case can be made that one of the scenes (an extension of the Sulu/Chekhov \\"lost in the woods\\" scene showing the 23rd Century Mount Rushmore) should have made it to the final cut.  Cosmic Thoughts looks at spirituality in the Star Trek Universe, and A Green Future addresses environmental concerns in the present day and their impact in the future.<br />Recommended for completists only.e from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith.

B00005RHGK|3.0|Let me tell you folks, this is the most difficult review I've ever written.  Why?  Personal politics about director Victor Salva.  I won't rehash the reasons since so many reviews here tell the story, but let it be said that I feel he's a detestable human being.  But I'm trying to put those feelings aside(it's difficult though) and just review the film itself.  After all, I learned to do it with Woody Allen's films.  Most of the bad reviews of this film are bashing it for all the wrong reasons.  They're most likely written by &quot;Scream&quot; generation horror fans looking for the same kind of thing.  Well, in Jeepers Creepers you won't be getting that, but instead a throwback to the 70s/80s school of bizarre, grindhouse horror flicks.  Very much like the style of Rob Zombie's House of 1,000 Corpses.  This style is more appreciated by the fans of obscure horror films of glory days past.  I'm not defending Jeepers Creepers 100% coz it certainly has it's flaws.  The biggest flaw is an overdose of the &quot;Creeper.&quot;  It was much more effective to see him from a distance in his attire.  Even as we get closer to him and see what he looks like, it still isn't bad.  Once he sheds his clothes, revealing a silvery, bird-like body, he ceases to be the least bit mysterious or creepy from then on.  They should have kept it simple.  Simplicity with this kind of formula works wonders.  Yes, I agree the main characters are annoying.  The frightened expression that the leading man wears throughout 90% of the film is fake looking and comical.  Reviewers bash this coz all their questions regarding the monster weren't answered.  Does everybody need explanations spoon fed to them?  I thought horror lied within what we don't fully understand;  The unknown.  The current trend in horror films is to have an explanation for EVERYTHING!  That's why older horror films are so much better.  A director had a crazy idea and went with it.  Many classics were made this way.  No one liked the ending.  I don't think the ending could have been any better.  Hero dies and monster gets away.  That's the way a horror film should end if you ask me.  Why make it fluffy and Disney?  Doesn't really belong in horror.  If you want that kind of closure, watch a romance film or a Bruckheimer action flick.  Basically three stars is the best route to go considering it's pretty much Even Steven.  I will say that when you avoid the personal politics, this film does entertain quite well in that nostalgic, midnight &quot;B&quot; movie way.e ending.

0792165020|5.0|Merely watching the film, you might think this is a &quot;very good&quot; effort, at best.  Thanks to the added features of the DVD (plus it helps if you're familiar with Patricia Highsmith's RIPLEY series), there is the added insight to make this a particularly enjoyable and informative viewing experience.  You will come away from this with an appreciation for the artistry of the cast &amp; crew (esp. music &amp; cinematography) and wonder why the director couldn't have made a better adaptaion of COLD MOUNTAIN.  Well...maybe when the DVD comes out!
B0000089GM|5.0|Well, to get this over with, I think everyone should chek out both [...] and [...] Type in Du hast at dict.leo.org, and it will show you what that means. The point in keeping the confusion was so that the double meaning could shine through. Obviously it's confused a lot of people who don't want to do their research.<br />But the real point here is that this is a great album. I adore each and every last song on it. I can't pick a favorite song on here, though I've tried. It's very good for people who like Evanesence, Metallica, Depeche Mode, or even Disturbed. I completely recommend it. Pick it up and enjoy!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I have enjoyed Sarah's music for some years and was fortunate enough to see her in her Lilith Fair days.  She is a stellar musician and sings songs with heart.  However, I didn't find any of that on this CD.  I found this depressing and boring.  To her credit, it sounds from the songs as though she has had a lot of conflict and chaos in her life during her 5 year hiatus and perhaps this hindered her creativity and spirit.  I will still look forward to her next CD, but can't recommend this one.
B00004TDTO|5.0|A beautiful dvd version of both the image and the sound clarifies what's great about the film.  Jaws hit like a bomb in 1975 because it's the perfect fusion of old-style Hollywood suspense story-telling (with Hitchcock's Birds and Psycho being important models - e.g. the opening scene with the nightswimming gal combines elements of Psycho's shower scene with Tippi Hedren's \\"trapped in the upstairs bedroom\\" scene from the Birds) and all the new ideas flowing in from Altman and others.  The overlapping dialogue in and apparently loose framing of various early town and pier scenes really anchors the whole tale in (something like) reality, and it's pure Altman.  Great.  The other tellingly (then) new  Hollywood thing is just how much of Jaws was shot on location (which is usefully clarified by the \\"Making of\\" extra).  Where Hitchcock would have shot, say, the beach scenes in a studio.... here the Easy Rider ethos of just getting out on location rules.  And yet DP Bill Butler and Spielberg get control over the frame and color, e.g., while shooting from the water-line a hundred yards off-shore, that Hitchcock would have been proud of.  Genius.  And finally, obviously there's *that* score by John Williams.  <br />Jaws was a film that changed the game in Hollywood but not always in good ways or for the right reasons - I've heard Alan Rudolph say (with some plausibility) that Jaws killed off dialogue in American movies: that Jaws \\"ate the words\\".  This dvd clarifies that for all its regrettable influence, Jaws itself is nearly perfect, and will for all sorts of good reasons be watched and studied for as long as people still like to watch films or aspire to make films themselves.
B00008EYA5|3.0|S.W.A.T. is better than most of the cop movies of recently. In Bad Boys 2, Will Smith and Martin Lawence chase the bad guys without even caring about innocent civilians getting hurt. Meanwhile in S.W.A.T. Colin Farrell's partner shoots a hostage and he doesn't want anything to do with him after that. If Will Smith shot a hostage in Bad Boys 2 in order to shoot the bad guy Martin Lawence would congradulate him on a job well done.<br />  Sure S.W.A.T. does have some brainless summer movie action but it still manages to be smarter and more realistic than Bad Boys 2. It's also smart how it doesn't over-due playing the theme song from the tv show.  That could've been a annoying and a bad movie based on a tv show would play the theme song through the whole movie. Colin Farrell and Samual L. Jackson have good chemestry as well. I would've liked to have seen the Colin Farrell and Michelle Rodriguez character get together though. They have good chemestry but the script doesn't let them  act on that.<br />  I liked how the bad guy gets other people even cops to be bad by offering a million dollars to who ever breaks him out. When I first heard that was the plot, I found it silly but it actually works. You don't know when someone is going to attack the S.W.A.T. inorder to rescue the bad guy and get the money. You don't even know who will either. So I found that cool. The movie doesn't depend on a bunch of big explosions like most  action movies these days seem to depend on. So it shows that action movies don't need non-stop explosions to be good, it's a nice change.
B00009V7RF|1.0|i had high hopes for bep album after listnin to songs like shut up and where is the love but wen i brought the album i was like why is evry1 saying this is a good album its crap. i wasted money on this album when i could of done something better like spend money on bog role.   <BR>this must be the worst album yet from bep and probly the crappest album of the year. where is the love and shut up are the only good songs out of the album  dont waste your money ive warned u
B00008EYA5|5.0|Easly one on my top ten list. The way this movie unfolded was amazing, the storyline, the effects, and ofcourse the kick ass cast including Colin Farrel (Phone Booth, American Outlaws) LL Cool J (Deep Blue Sea, Halloween H2O) Michelle Rodriguez (Resident Evil) and ofcourse the kickass Samuel L Jackson (Shaft). <BR>       This is an action packed movie that keeps you wanting more. With a cast like this and and story line so mind blowing I (already have) would jump on the movie AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh's voice is simply breathtaking!  I was overwhelmed by his first album, but this one takes me away - beyond my provencial day-to-day life.  These arrangements are enrapturing and romantic.  Though I do not understand the words to the foreign language songs, I am awed and moved by each piece, and absolutely enthralled by his passion.  Oh, he is so lucky to have such a gift!  Thank you, thank you!  More, please!

B000089RVX|1.0|I've heard this band beiong compared to Linkin Park many times, and I thought to myself &quot;Hey, Linkin Park isn't that bad of a band. I think I'll listen to this Evanescence album&quot;. Sadly, I found out that this really didn't sound like a Linkin Park album one bit.<br />The main problem that I had with this album is that every song sounded the same to me. And the thing is, that song sounded like crap to me. So this whole album felt like an hour-long crappy song to me.<br />I give it 1 star<BR>*
0446677450|3.0|Although the book, in theory, is practical, it's not actually very useful because it only gives you the theory not the how-to, and many people, including myself don't know how to put their knowledge from the book to use.  The whole thing is inarticulate and it seemed like a bunch of ideas were randomly jumbled together, but don't get me wrong, I didn't actually dislike it, I'm just a little frustrated because I know that the sooner you start the better and I don't know how to and am to lazy to figure it out.  And, I also liked how it suggested that school and a &quot;good education&quot; is overrated because that's what I've been saying all along.
B000084T18|2.0|50 Cent has to be one of the most overrated artists to come around in the past 10 years. It seems that both media hip-pop fans and underground hip-hop fans love this guy. I just can't understand why. First off, let me list off some reasons why I feel he sucks:<br />-He has no flow<br />-He shows absolutely no emotion. He has the same boring, monotone vocals in each song.<br />-He's another rapper who tries to get by on good beats, rather than lyrical talent.<br />-On the song, &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot;, Eminem embarasses the man on his own track. You can obviously tell who the better lyricist is here.<br />-All he talks about is how he's going to kill people.<br />-He has an annoying slur.<br />The only good songs on &quot;Get Rich Or Die Tryin'&quot; are &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; (which is good only because of Eminem), &quot;21 Questions&quot; (Nate Dogg saves this one from sucking), and &quot;Life's On The Line&quot; (A hidden track which was made before he got shot and gained that annoying slur).
B00005JMFR|5.0|This movie, in my opinion, is just as involved emotionally as the first one, and the visuals are unbelievable.  But, I am a die-hard Matrix fan (You know, one of those who memorizes the scripts, wathes each one 2 and 3 times in a row and like it as much each time).  So, I probablly have a bigger love for it, as one reviewer said, all the die hard fans will enjoy this movie
6305313687|5.0|Strong, powerful, emotional, and interesting. These are just a few words to describe the film \\"American History X\\", starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.<br />I found the plot to be very entertaining and something I haven't seen from Hollywood in awhile. The acting was excellent, as you'd expect from these great actors.<br />The DVD itself features three deleted scenes, Cast & Crew profiles, and a Theatrical trailer. The only thing out of those that really held my interest were the Deleted scenes, which were so good that they should have been kept in the movie.<br />I give American History X five stars<BR>*****
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I've never been very fond of the album, Let It Be--not compared to the other records that make up the last chunk of the Beatles' remarkable eight-year run. This remixing of that album reveals some of the beauty that had been obscured beneath the veneer of Phil Spector's famous (and infamous) 'wall of sound' production.<br /><br />The three songs that bore Spector's imprint most are the ones that benefit to the greatest, most obvious extent: Let It Be, Across the Universe, and The Long and Winding Road, all of which were overproduced to the point of near pomposity, are now stripped of choirs and orchestras and the focus is shifted to the singer and the song, rather than the producer and the arrangement. This is true, too, of songs that had been less overblown in the original release. The mix has been changed in songs like Get Back, I Me Mine, Love You Blue, I Dig a Pony (which I like MUCH better here, which isn't saying much, since I'd always been rather annoyed by the Spector-produced rendition), and my favorite song on the album, Two of Us. Now, instead of the instruments nearly drowning out the singers' voices, the accompaniment is toned down, and the lyrics and the singers' voices (especially those of the late, lamented George and John) ring through beautifully.<br /><br />I tend to be a minimalist, so it's not surprising that I prefer this album. It's still second-tier Beatles, not quite on the level of Sgt. Peppers, Abbey Road, or Revolver, but even second-tier Beatles is better than just about anyone else.
B00005JMTN|4.0|A delightful afternoon of fantasy that touches the imagination in all of us. This film has charm and fantasy and that is a combination that works (for me).

B00001NFCY|4.0|Creed lightened up just a little bit on their second album, &quot;Human Clay.&quot; That also meant the songwriting was a little more consistent. Songs like &quot;Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Higher&quot; and &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; gave view to a much broader sense of spiritual-self than on the frequently claustrophobic trapped sense given off by &quot;My Own Prison.&quot; Perhaps that album's runaway success gave Scott Stapp the courage to explore his Christian testimonial tendencies (don't forget, rock was his escape from a particularly repressive religious upbringing), and it works for most of the record. For those who belittle Stapp for making those beliefs an integral part of his music, it seemed to be an invaluable wellspring for the likes of U2, Live and POD, not to mention Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Johnny Cash.<br />Besides, there's nothing like a new kid in the family to pull a great song out of a man. &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; is for more graceful a song than most post-grungers ever managed to write. If Stapp would rather work his Eddie Vedder/Jim Morrison voice around a lyric like &quot;there's a peace inside us all&quot; (from &quot;Wash Away Those Years&quot;), more power to him. Better that than more songs about murder and mayhem. Like the cover art's portrait of a man struggling at a crossroads, Creed sought to take a chance with a road less traveled with &quot;Human Clay.&quot;
B0000AQS0F|5.0|An excellent show, good writing, Emmy-winning Special Visual Effects that look amazing in progressive scan widescreen.<br />The characters are deep, the dialog is witty, the plots are alternately amusing and frightening.<br />The 3 unaired episodes are among the best of the series.  Commentary is present for about 1/3 of the episodes providing those who are already fans with background details and trivia, and providing a glimpse of the camraderie behind the scenes.  The other features were also worthwhile.<br />Star Trek covered the world of the best crews of the Federation; Firefly covers the other guys, the ones scratching out a living on the edge with what equipment and crew they can scrounge.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Not enough can be said about the greatest animator to come along in the last 40 years.  Writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki, is responsible for animated classics such as \\"My Neighbor Totoro,\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service.\\"  That's not to also mention perhaps the greatest animated feat since Disney's \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Princess Mononoke.\\"  At the 2003 Academy Awards his movie \\"Spirited Away\\" received the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, with help from well over 100 top-ten lists from some of today's most well known critics.<br />Chihiro is the typical ten-year-old; especially when it comes to moving to a new house and a new way of life.  Already frightened and unsure about the future Chihiro is confronted with a new challenge when her father misses the turnoff to their new home and winds up at the entrance of a seemingly abandon theme park.<br />\\"It's an abandon theme park . . . they built them everywhere in the early nineties.  Then the economy went bad, and they all went bankrupt.  This must be one of them . . .\\"<br />Dusk approaches as Chihiro's parents decide to investigate.  They cross a long field of grass and soon pickup on the scent of food lingering in the air.  After several minutes of looking they find several steaming dishes of food at a counter. Chihiro's parents decide to help themselves, even at the requests of Chihiro to leave.  Paying no attention to her Chihiro decides to go for a walk and shortly after runs into the mysterious young character, Haku, who hastily insists that she leave before dark.  But it is too late.  Large, ghostlike shadows begin to appear out of encroaching dusk.  Chihiro runs to where her parents are eating only to find two enormous pigs where her parents once sat.  Horrified, Chihiro calls out their names to no avail.  She tries to run away, only to find the field she had crossed earlier, is now a lake.<br />It is here that Chihiro encounters an enchanting new world that will test her own abilities, and make light of the ones within her.<br />I know most folks are thinking this is another one of them \\"coming of age\\" stories.  And maybe you're right.  But you're wrong to grade \\"Spirited Away\\" by same criteria as the Hollywood same-old-same-old.  Yes, the movie is animated, which probably sends most people's thoughts of the movie straight to the \\"kiddie realm,\\" and I'd have to say you're wrong again.  Hayao Miyazaki is heavily credited for re-inventing the definition of animation.  Though his characters are drawn, the essence they encapsulate is so much more than people give credit for.  His stories are deep, enthralling, and touching.  They strike at the very chord of human imagination, and all its capacities.<br />After the first five minutes of this movie, I forgot I was watching \\"cartoon\\" characters and began to see them as real people; which ironically happens in just about all of Miyazaki's films.  Miyazaki redefines the genre of animation by giving thought into every aspect of his work.  The backgrounds are rich in detail and deep in soul. Every shot has been specifically placed to tell the story in its amazing entirety.  In fact Miyazaki personally checks and re-checks every drawing that will be placed in the final cut. Animation allows the plot to shine and Miyazaki's original concepts to surface in a way that has never been done before.  This is a man that takes pride in his work, and it is a fact that is strongly evident in every epic he creates.<br />Although the movie places a strong emphasis on entertaining the younger crowd, several subtle messages are placed in various points throughout the film.  One example would be that of the character No Face who offers those in the bathhouse with gold.  We later find that No Face is actuality a monster who eats other spirits.  I believe this is representative of opportunities that are too good to be true.  If you're not careful they'll take you down with them.  Also, Kamaji, the boiler room man, at first tries to dissuade Chihiro fromgetting a job by proclaiming that there are none left.  However, we find that Chihiro's adherent persistence eventually gets her a job.  And perhaps the most evident is that of Chihiro signing away her name to the witch Yubaba for a job.  Yubaba gives her the name Sen, and as we work our way through the film we find that Chihiro begins to forget her old name until she is helped by Haku.  In this way symbolizing the thought that we must never forget who we are, regardless of circumstance.<br />With this movie Hayao Miyazaki has again teamed up with famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi.  Hisaishi does a great job at articulating screen to sheet; every note resonates with the essence of the movie.  I heartily believe that the movie could not have reached its full potential without the musical direction of Mr. Hisaishi. <br />This is an excellent DVD set worthy of any cinematic collection that strives for greatness.  By far this is the best-marketed and extra-featured DVD that any of Miyazaki's movies have enjoyed in the states.<br />But perhaps the most enjoyable feature is the Nippon Television Special - The Making of The Film (Spirited Away) on the bonus disc.  The television special shows the inner workings of the Studio Ghibli animation company.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound gives a more lifelike feel to the film, and the included original Japanese language track is always on the checklist for hardcore anime fans.<br />The only downside of the DVD set is the \\"Spirited Away\\" introduction by John Lasseter at the beginning of the movie.  Disney's last hope in taking some credit for Hayao Miyazaki's work.  Ah, but I digress the movie speaks for more than itself and is one of the finer things in life that make it so enjoyable.<br />Miyazaki San, you never cease to amaze . . .
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is a lot like the John Wayne Western, \\"The Searchers\\".     Travis has 2 choices, Kill the Presidential Candidate or Save the Girl. His first choice is to Kill the Candidate... That says a lot about Travis.  For as much as we cheer when he blows them away, for Travis this was his 2nd choice.    Why does Travis want to kill Palantine? Is it because he wants revenge? He wants to Kill the thing Betsy loves most, which is her cause? Is it because Travis sees the phoniness of politicians is just as bad as the Pimps and Prostitutes on the streets. Is it because HE wants the fame?     It's probably a little bit of everything. \\"Here is a man who could not take it anymore\\". Travis rises up!    It is also interesting to note a chilling similarity to \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" in Taxi Driver. Just as we see the Angela Landsbury is the controller of her own son as an assassin through brain washing, we are blinded to the fact that Janet Leigh is Frank Sinatra's operator, (Note the strange conversation in the train car, \\"Would you like a cigarette?\\").    Anyway, it always amazes me how many people have seen this movie countless times, but have never noticed that it's Palantine in the Taxi with the Hooker in the opening minutes. There is no question about it, Palantine IS trash. That explains a lot... but you just don't put it together if your not watchng closely enough.       I especially like the bit with the kids throwing cans and rocks at the taxi (Booing the heel for not saving Iris from Sport). Very cool, you just don't see craft like this anymore.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie, being a remake of the first movie starring Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris is charming and almost cunning.  This is the version starring Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween H20) and Lindsay Lohan (The Parent Trap).  I loved this movie from the moment it started.  It has some corney parts and some almost funny while being part of reality.  Of course, trading places can't really happen in real life!  Or can it??  If you love Jamie in the Halloween series and Lindsay in The Parent Trap, this is the movie for you!!  Enjoy!!  Check out my other reviews!!<br />~~XoXoXo Treybaby~~
B0000A1RJI|5.0|this is an excelent CD.  if you enjoied the movie, you are sure to enjoy the CD, too.  it captures all the moments of the movie, and when i listen to it, i can close my eyes and watch the movie in my head with the sound.
B00006JKOL|3.0|This is pretty much Jethro Tull's swan song. <br />In the first place, with Jeffrey Hammond's subsequent departure, every following Tull is not really a Tull. That needs a bit of explaining: It is true technically that from &quot;This Was&quot; to &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; every Jethro Tull album involved a change in membership, but it isn't true in spirit because, with the exception of Martin Barre, all the new members (Evan, Hammond, Barlow) were really OLD members, members of the pre-recording group, and Barre joined just at the time (&quot;Stand Up&quot;) the recording group came in to its own.<br />In the second place, this was the next-to-last creative gasp of the group, or something resembling the group (the last creative gasp--from something resembling the group--was &quot;Songs From the Wood&quot;). It's superior to the records that flank it (&quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Too Old To Rock And Roll&quot;), superior to all Tulls (or Tull pretenders) subsequent to &quot;Songs From The Wood&quot; and inferior to all Tulls preceding &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;.<br />Buy it for sentiment's sake.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Wow, what a great collection of songs by Shania and husband Mutt Lange.  Her happy music makes you get up and sing along with her.  Her clear enunciation allows you to understand the lyrics.  I believe in the theory K.I.S.S. (Keep it Simple, Stupid), and Shania's music is fun, exhiliarating, and uncomplicated, each with its own special message.  Her very talented band provides an impressive background to her performance.  Whether she sings country or pop, Shania is unsurpassed in voice and presentation.  This DVD abounds with her beautiful songs, and it is presented flawlessly by this very gifted woman with her abundant energy and unique, exotic voice.  Keep your beautiful music coming, Shania!  I plan to have a front-row seat when your tour visits my city.
B000008H1U|1.0|Needless to say, there's nothing happening here. The songwriter has nothing to say; the singer (one and the same) can't sing. I was particularly dismayed at the quantity of robot music here, though. We have several songs with lifelessly programmed drum machines and (probably sequenced) cheesy synthesizers. A-V-O-I-D.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I couldn't wait to get season five.  Got it in, and expected at least 12 episodes.  I saw only 2 dics and thought there must be another one somewhere!  How disappointing!!  You would think that they would at least charge less for this DVD than all the others, considering there is less on it.  With only 8 episodes to watch, I feel very shorted.  This season just didn't do it for me, how long till season 6??!
B00003CXB4|5.0|You've haven't seen &quot;The Lion King&quot;until you've seen it on DVD!I love because of the enhanced sound and picture-James Earl Jones'voice will make your TV vibrate!The music and songs have never sounded better.I also love the behind-the-scenes info and the &quot;Circle of Life&quot;video featuring Hillary Duff,Raven Simone and other stars of Disney Channel series.Of course I love the great story!If you like Disney animation,a good plot and great music stop lion around and buy this 2-disc set!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|What an amazing collection! As the other reviews note, everyone has favorites that are bound to be missing (in my case that would be 10th Avenue Freeze-Out and Prove It all Night), but everything here is great and truly essential. Add the third disc of bonus tracks and look at the price - it's the biggest bargain in music you'll find this season. Rosalita and The Rising in the same collection - how can anyone complain?
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers Extended Edition is actually better than the theatrical version simply because it adds more depth to every aspect of the film..Settings, Characters, and most importantly, the story. The Two Towers Extended Edition clocks in at 3 hours and 43 minutes, yea, some would say &quot;Ohh thats too long&quot;, but true Lord of the Rings fans like myself, love every second of it! The additional 43 minutes covers all new and extended scenes which give the viewer a better understanding of the 2nd chapter in this epic trilogy. Bottom line, If you have the theatrical version of The Two Towers on DVD, go ahead and purchase the Extended Edition. Not to mention, it's a 4 disc set...Discs 1 and 2 contain the movie itself, and Discs 3 and 4 contain hours of awesome special features such as doctumentaries, featurettes, etc. LOTR fans, trust me, you won't be dissapointed!
B0000TB014|4.0|I just completed watching the promotion of this DVD on network TV and now plan to purchase Michael's latest work.The one thing that has impressed me most was the awe inspiring work of Michael Jackson and the electrifing effect that he has had on millions of people.I personally feel that we all have spiritual gifts that we bring to earth, a soul mission or a purpose that we were meant to share with others. Michael found his at the peak of his career and this DVD helps us to remember that he was lucky enough to find his gift and to share it with millions.We know when our soul mission is found when everything we do or touch is electrifing and we instill a feeling of awe and amazment in other people.Michael has done that and this DVD is a reminder to us of that part of our time in history that we were able to share with someone fortunate enough to find their soul mission. I personally believe that Michael's fall was his failure to accept or appreciate his gift and to think that he had to consistently improve himself through artifical means when his magic was always from the inside.That is the point when Michael's life changed, in my opinion, and that is the tradgey that we all feel after viewing such an magical time as this DVD reminds us of.We are all very fortunated to have been on earth at this time to hear and see how someone's soul mission can be fulfilled with what appears to be an seemly effortlessly ability on his part and that is where the magic comes from.<BR>This DVD keeps that magic alive....
078401115X|5.0|\\" Angel Heart\\" is a truly terrifying and suspenseful murder/mystery film set in the 1940's. Harry Angel ( Mickey Rourke) is a private investigator about to go on a job that will bring him to the edge of insanity. He is approached by a mysterious and evil looking man named Louis Cyphre ( Robert De Niro). Apparantly a singer named Johnny Favorite has something of his, and he wants him tracked down. Harry agrees to take the case but has no idea what he is getting himself into. The case leads from the streets of New York to the swamps of the Louisana Bayou. Frustrated and running low on clues, he runs into Epiphany Proudfoot ( Lisa Bonet) who is a high voodoo priestess. She introduces Harry to the dark and mysterious world of voodoo. As the two get closer, so does Harry to the truth of where Johnny is, and who he really is. But the truth that Harry is looking for, could be too much for him to handle... <br />\\"Angel Heart\\" is an outstanding mystery film that provides for endless amounts of terror and suspense. You will be on the edge of your seat while watching this film. The script is great and provides for awesome dialogue and tons of twists and turns. The ending is shocking, and will force you to pick your jaw up off the floor. The background, set pieces, and costume designs really give the film its sense of authenticity. It is a shame that not more people know about this film, because it is truly one of the most original and frightening horror films available. <br />The performances are outstanding. Mickey Rourke does the best job with Harry Angel. We see Harry go from confident P.I. on a routine missing persons, to a paranoid and frightened man on the brink of losing his mind. It is great to watch as the case becomes more personal, and becomes less random. Lisa Bonet prooves that she can do more than be one of the Cosby's. She is extremely sexy and does a great job with the role. The infamous love scene between Harry and her may shock you. Robert De Niro's Louis Cyphre is extremely powerful and scary for the limited amount of screen time he has. Before the film ends, you will probably be able to guess his true identity, but you are still shocked and scared when you finally find out. Charloette Rampling is great as Margaret Krusemark. She plays a fortune teller who is into black magic and helps Harry on the case. Watching her go from a sweet woman, to the evil witch she really is well freak you out! <br />Overall, Angel Heart is truly a great horror film. The mystery is well done and hides the truth very well. The ending is one of the most shocking I have ever seen. The story itself offers endless amounts of terror and nail biting suspense. The actors are all great. This is deffinately a must see movie that you will enjoy. The DVD is great because it has a featurette that shows the making of the film.
B000002BBY|5.0|My god. This CD is an instant classic. Every utterance of sound eminating from my speakers as this glorious compact disk plays makes me feel twice as good as the second before. Songs like Hello, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, and Champagne Supernova top my favorite list. It is essential for any music lover to spend the 13ish dollars on this CD. As for iTunes users, sorry but it isnt on the database. I give this album 5 stars, easily.
6305313687|5.0|Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) loses his father Dennis (William Russ), who is a firefighter , that died putting out a firefighter in a crack house. Ever since then, Derek has been filled with hate, rage, violence, and racism. He joins up with Cameron Alexander ( Stacey Keach) who is the leader of the Nazi movement in Los Angeles. One night Derek catches three African American men breaking into his car, and he kills them. Derek is sent to prison for six years. While inside, Derek reluctantly becomes friends with an African American prisoner named Lamont (Guy Torry). Over time, Lamont causes Derek to realize that all his hate and anger never made his life any better. Now he is out and a changed man. Unfortunately , his brother Danny ( Edward Furlong) is headed in the exact same direction Derek was, and loves the life of a Nazi. Now it is up to Derek to save his brother and teach him the true meaning of redemption. <br />\\"American History X\\" is one of the best films that I have ever seen. The story is amazing, all the actors are outstanding, and the script provides for shocking scenes and great dialogue overall. The film takes an extremely controversial look at racism and shows just how damaging it can be. Watching the film unfold will leave you in awe. The parts dealing with Derek's past are shot in black and white to give them more of an ominous appeal. The present is shot in color to give the appearance of hope. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard. He plays both sides of the character great. He is very convincing as a skinhead, and after prison shows that redemption is possible. Edward Furlong in my opinion did the best job in the movie. Furlong supplies extremely realistic emotion to let the audience know the inner conflict that his character is dealing with. The reason the character has such an impact on the film is because he is only trying to be like his brother. The rest of the cast was filled with excellent actors that include Stacey Keach, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Beverly De Angelo, and Fairuza Balk.<br />\\"American History X\\" is a highly controversial and disturbing film. It has shocking scenes and a realistic look at racism. But the story and characters are emotionally driven, and Derek's fight towards retribution is inspriring! It is an entertaining film, but an important one as well. A truly memorable classic.
B0000C2IXO|1.0|Cameron Diaz(Charlies Angels), Lucy Liu(Charlies Angels) and Drew Barrymore(Charlies Angels) reprise their roles as the three lovable angels from the 2000 hit movie..but this one is plaing dumb, 1 in a half star for me..becuase theres some funny parts in this movie....and some cameos. cameos include, Olsen Twins(tv's Full House), Eve(XXX), Eric Bogosian(Gossip) and Bruce Willis(Bandits)...well because his ex Demi Moore(St. Elmos Fire) is in this one...terrible dialouge with lots of stupid action set pieces makes this a crappy sequel...damn you McG(tv's Fastlane) for making this junk..other stars include Andrew Wilson(Royal Tenenbaums), his brother Luke Wilson(Blue Streak), Matt LeBlanc(Lost In Space), Robert Patrick(Die Hard 2:Die Harder), Justin Theroux(Mulholland Dr.), John Cleese(Die Another Day), Crispin Glover(Like Mike), Carrie Fisher(Drop Dead Fred), Nick Cassevettes(Face/Off),  Shai LeBeouf(Tv's Even STevens), John Forsythe(Charlie from the tv show Charlies Angels) and Bernie Mac(Head OF State, he has like 3 funny moments, when he is playing Clue, when hes a crossing guard and when hes explaining hes Irish), pure crap
B00008PX8P|5.0|Never before has such a good DVD been released.  I got this a little unsure about the package but lemme tell you something, it's worth the money and more.  It even turned me on to my new fave Zeppelin song (Misty Mountain Hop, the 1972 version is awesome!) The Moby Dick drum solo (speaking as a drummer) is mind blowing.  The whole DVD is mindblowing!  A++++ (if that's even possible).
0385504209|2.0|Although the premise is intriguing, author Brown's prologue statement that, with few stated exceptions, all facts are accurate is somewhat misleading.<br />I think that Brown's idea of &quot;accuracy&quot; is somewhat similar to the way Oliver Stone treated &quot;history&quot; in his film &quot;J.F.K.&quot;<br />If the reader is less interested in complete accuracy than an interesting story, this is a fine book. The characters are one-dimensional and, at times, the writing seems workmanlike. Nevertheless, the premise keeps the fires of this story stoked until the very last pages.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Unfortunately Jaws has not aged that well, thanks to a prop that looks like a great big hunk of painted gum with teeth. Even Speilberg has pretty much said in interviews that the shark pained him and working on the beast was a nightmare. He is rumoured to even have consulted with ILM on a CGI make-over for a new edition of the movie. Thank God that the shark does not actually appear in close-up until the end of the film and when it is on the screen it is only there for a few moments and the actors manage to perform circles around it so that we are never fully concerned about the quality of the giant swimming condom. If it wasn't for them, this would be B-Movie hokum for sure and the Berg would probably just be any other director looking to making it big.<br />No, even the film transcends its central eight ton human killing prophylactic to bring us a story that is just so much more about the people and their social issues than the monster on the loose. Let's face it - Brody is a depressing lazy ass cop who is pretty inept in every department except for that Last Shot. Quinn IS certifiable and Hooper is a ladies man with an inferiority complex. When you put them together in a boat for days out at sea then there is going to be plenty of half-witted power playing to keep us all tuned in... but let's back up a bit.<br />Even before they get together for that second part of the film, back on shore the town of Amity has its own problems. Girls get beaming drunk and go swimming as if it is a good thang to do! Their lovers take twenty minutes to get undressed and usually just collapse into a sleep in the process. Hell, I want to go to Amity! The local doctor squirms at the sight of blood. The town mayor is a defunct corrupt fifties swinger who is mostly surrounded by ambulance chasers. Brody's deputy is far from bright and the local gang of fishermen have just appeared out of the movie Deliverance with boxes on TNT - sixty men to a five foot boat too! Amity is Sharkville for good reason. Then we have a marine biologist who knows more about pathology than the Doc and who thinks it is a great idea to take a dip in the water at night with a big shark swimming around. Brody's kids even sit in boats two inches away from the water during the height of the attacks. Man have they got it commin'! The inbred population of Amity have an IQ of a dead slug on fire. When you couple the dummies stupidity with a monster on the loose you got yourself heaps of suspense! How could anything not go wrong!<br />Yes the Berg pretty much got it right on all counts. Jaws is essentially akin to throwing a cat into a room full of rats and watching the mayhem that will ensue. Here the Berg gives the rats' great dialogue to play with and shoots the whole sequence of events from quite savoury angles. Which all ends up with...<br />A fantastic summer blockbuster movie about a town called &quot;Stupid&quot; being eaten up a &quot;dangerous rubber johnny&quot;!!good reason.

1586210661|4.0|Summary:<BR>The book is a collection of short stories, all of which I believe are based on the author's actual experiences.  Some of the stories are about Sedaris's childhood and his life just before leaving for France, but the majority about his time spent in France. <br />My Comments:<BR>All of the stories are well-written, engaging, and entertaining.  As is the case with 'Holidays On Ice', the author never reveals when a story is fictitious or not, but I was inclined to believe that all of these were non-fiction (though there might be an embellishment here or there).<br />I'm also not sure what, if anything, I missed because I listened to this book on CD, but the live recordings for some reason were even more funny than his normal writings.  Listening to them live is definitely a boon for the CD version.<br />I was impressed by the author's candor about his personal life.  To be willing to reveal one's quirks and even poke fun at them takes either a lot of money or a lot of self-security.  I'm not sure which is Sedaris's motivation, but whatever it is, it's nice to hear someone being frank about life.  <br />Though the stories jump all over the place and don't really seem to have a common thread, I don't think anyone can argue that Sedaris has a gift for telling poignant and humorous short stories.  The stories are a bit outlandish and the author is blunt, meaning they probably aren't for everyone, but I would definitely recommend this book.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, is due to be remastered in 2004, along with several other discs in the collection.  Hey You will be part of the Box Set due out the end of January.  All that aside, this CD is one of the best albums in the Cure's history and can show the wide range of their musical talents and moods within one record.  Anyone that knows anything about The Cure, puts this album in the top five, without a doubt.  The style and feeling of this album is The Cure in its glory, with many albums having a piece of Kiss Me in them.  If you do not like this album, you do not like The Cure
0743244249|4.0|As a novel it fails in every possible way: plot, characterization, dialogue etc.<BR>If you consider Cosmopolis a prose poem it works a lot better. DeLillo should have gone all the way and write directly in verse. Cosmopolis could have been compared to The Dunciad, The Age of Anxiety, the 'dramatic monologues' of Robert Browning, The Vanity of Human Wishes, The Prelude, Byron.<BR>In poetry the greatest possible meaning has to be expressed in the smallest possible space, and I think it works (to a point) in Cosmopolis.<BR>The dialogues don't have to be naturalistic - just meaningful. The characters don't be to well rounded - they are just human types. The plot doesn't have to hang togheter - it has to illustrate the morality of the story.<BR>The writing of DeLillo, in this way, is quite beatiful and his description of the effects that ridicolous wealth and power can have on people (both the rich, the hangers-on, the others) feels right.<BR>And I don't really think that Cosmopolis is dated. A lot of things have changed after 9/11: among them not the lives of people like Eric Packer. Frankly I don't understand people who thinks that people like him are uninteresting or not important. Rich and powerful people are always interesting and important and no, they don't have to be sympathetic or human to command obedience, respect and even affection.<BR>Of course, a real novel would have been better. Underworld is much better and important. Cosmopolis is an interesting attempt.
0062502182|4.0|I thought this was a very well written book in terms of the way PC wove and micro-managed the book's details. But wasn't sure about the content, which seemed to me to be a wide collection of material gathered together from sources you're sort of familiar with, yet can't quite put your finger on, as to where you heard or read it before. <br />PC is a good writer, but, at the end of the day, I can't really see what the fuss is about.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I was reading several reviews of people concerned that some tracks (ex. &quot;Love is all around&quot; and &quot;All I want for Christmas&quot;) were not on the soundtrack.  They are.  Amazon just lists 14 tracks out of 17 included in the CD and these are precisely the tracks missing from Amazon's list.  So don't be fooled- they're all here.  <BR>The soundtrack is great and very very enjoyable- you can actually find yourself remembering the exact scenes and laughing out loud.  Nevertheless, it does lack some of the feel of the movie sometimes,and it probably doesn't make much sense to buy it unless you see the movie first (which by the way is outstanding).  <BR>Summary: Highly recommended- but only after you see the movie!
B00005JKC3|5.0|The director of Hulk, And Lee, has made the most expensive art house movie ever, making this the most original (and ballsiest) film in recent times and should be embraced as such.<BR>Ang had all the right ingredients to make easy cash for the studio. He had the rights to the Incredible Hulk. He had a $160 million budget (is that right? I can't remember). He had ILM doing the CGI. He could have easily given into the enormous pressure and made an hour and a half of destruction and chaos, but he was given something else... creative control. He produced a visually captivating cinematic experience like no other before it, with in depth characters, a complex (for a comic book adaptation) story, a  touching love story and, most importantly, kick-ass action delivered in frequent, explosive, adrenaline charged, and yet still wholly original, doses. Despite it's many character development scenes, Ang has used an inspired (and entirely appropriate) technique to keep the pace flowing like an air to Hulk missile. The narrative flow of the film is as if from the pages of a comic book, with picture in picture scenes giving multiple angles of any given situation to allow for maximum information intake or simply to get things moving along, which, accompanied with Danny Elfman's [restrained] score, makes the Hulks' 2 hour plus running time a breeze.<BR>This movie is accompanied with a great second disc that reveals what is already apparent on the screen, that making this movie was indeed a labor of love for all parties. <BR>So, if you like your action movies with its balls as big as its brains, smash this into your shopping cart. NOW!
B00005JM0B|1.0|There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said before about this maggot-infested pile of dung parading as a movie.  As has been said before, it totally undid and contradicted the first two films.  The story line was pathetic, the &quot;twist&quot; ending a joke, and Arnold looked more like a well-preserved senior citizen than a killer robot.  Add in the tacky, lame attempts at humor like the sunglasses scene outside the bar, and you have a worthless film that should never have been made.  Have I made it clear that I hated it?
B000002JNJ|5.0|I make the comparison because even though this is a great album, they are sharpening the knives;Vulgar Display of Power is better written, played and more diverse, much like Metallica was doing with Kill 'Em All, which preceeded Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets and And Justice For All. Speaking of And Justice For All, you can hear the influence of that album with the off center production, pounding double bass drum, wincing rhythms and punk influenced speed. Though James Hetfield is a better lyricist than Phil Anselmo, he isn't a better singer than Phil. While once again, this is a great album, it's merely a starting point to bigger and better things.
B00006690G|4.0|OK the &quot;MARSHALL MATHERS&quot; was a stupid rap album ever. But this one ain't that bad. <BR>Some songs I like are:<BR>White America<BR>Without me<BR>Superman<BR>Sing for the moment (MY FAVOURITE)<br />COP THIS ONE
B000002JOH|5.0|It's 1992. With hardcore metal becoming more mainstream(mostly due to Metallica; no comment) and the rise of grunge and hip hop(much to my delight), what would be the fate of the genre? Fear not, fellow headbangers! Pantera, who had already relased the delightfully energetic Cowboys From Hell two years earlier, would excrete their measure of revenge on the music world. Vulgar Display Of Power is the best metal and second best rock album of 1992, after Alice In Chains &quot;Dirt&quot;.The influences of Metallica,Motorhead, Rush, Lynyrd Skynyrd and even some Bad Brains are prevelant, and the lyrics and musicianship are top notch. Track for track there is no let up on the kick ass Texas rock; I use to listen to &quot;Mouth For War&quot; &quot;F****n Hostile&quot; and &quot;Walk&quot; all the time, because I bought the album for those songs, but my favorite songs are &quot;Rise&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Hollow&quot;. What really suprised me was the song &quot;No Good&quot;, where the band sounds like a heavier version of Faith No More, and Phil Anselmo's rapping(if that's what he's doing)is pretty good. It's sad that they've broken up, because metal needs them; but never say never.......
B0000025C0|5.0|All the songs are GREAT and usually you hear the same boston songs (more than a feeling,dont look back,long time foreply) on the radio but I think that their best song of all that you never here on the radio could be (A Man I'll Never Be) and also a lot of their songs from THIRD STAGE are also great but you never here them either. Boston is just a great group.
0385504209|5.0|An amazing read!<br />I can barely come up with words that would adequately describe what I felt while reading this book. At just about every turn of the page, I gasped in awe. Every time I gasped, my husband would come running and ask me to read aloud what I had just read.  I now have a waiting list on people who want to read my book including my mother, husband and best friend.  I even got my coworkers, boss and hair stylist in on it.<br />Even though this book is &quot;fiction&quot;, the theories behind modern christianity and all that is related will shake you to the core.<br />Although it upended everything I was ever taught, it all made perfect sense.  If you like to be challenged and like to learn then this is the book for you
B00005JM0B|4.0|I did not have high expect ions to REALLY like this film, frankly I was not thrilled with T2.  Sometimes MORE is not better.  The original film had something T2 never achieved - HEART.  The focus in T2 was the special effects.  For that it was superior to the smaller budget sleeper Terminator.  But flash does not equate to substance, so in T2, I was like WOW - but is that all there is?  I expected more of T2 flash in T3, and there is that.  Buckle up, baby, it's about to get bumpy is a lot of the film.  So it provided the flash.  But T3 does something T2 did not, it tries to draw on it's roots of the first film, giving John connor something of his mother \\"who didn't ask for any of this\\" into his character. Nick Stahl does very well as making you believe he could be Sara Connor's son.  Claire Danes does what she could with the role, but it's a bit limited to \\"screaming let me out\\". Kristanna Loken does well as the non-stoppable Female Terminator - but, hey I often wonder if machines really would be machines that look sexy?  But, guess we are not supposed to worry about things like that.<br />Arnold is very well toned, but his performance is same old same old.  I has so many concerns, that I was surprised just how much I did enjoy it.  Mind bubblegum, but great fun anyway.<br />Connor is now in his twenties - the great Apocalypse has not come about and he is a drifter going from place to place.  Dane's Character Kate Brewster is a vet, planning on marriage and the daughter of the man responsible for pushing the button on the Sky Net Defence that permits the Machines to take over.<br />Connor breaks into her vet's office, but she catches him.  But before the police arrive the Terminators arrive and it's non-stop action.<br />It's mindless fun, but good fun.  So kick back and enjoy.  The goodies on the DVD seems rather rushed and half-hearted.  As with any time travel film: don't ask, just accept.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I ussually don't go to cinema to see films like this - big movies with millions of dollars (or pounds) behind them. But \\"Love actually\\" - commercial as it was - had much stronger impact on me than all dramas I used to watch. Made me feel optimistic and realize that love is still the most important thing although many years passed since St. Paul's Song of Love.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|It seems improbable for a live concert to have the depth and clarity of this one.  Even though the majority of the music is Harrison's, the breadth of the performers is absolutely staggering, and their covers of his music are riveting.  This album has haunted my thoughts through the day and my dreams at night.  I do not remember the last time I heard a musical display so intense and so beautiful.  The overall determination of the musicians to get the music right for their compatriot shows with each bar of music played, each lyric sung out, each song performed.  The oddest part is that I never really followed much of Harrison's early music, but now I'm a believer(sorry Monkees' fans).
B000001E7L|5.0|Quite simply put, this is the best CD I have ever owned.  I fell in love with this CD when I bought it four years ago, and it has remained my favorite ever since.  <BR>Dreaming my Dreams, Empty, Daffodil Lament and No Need to Argue are some of the best songs by the Cranberries that were never released as singles, and all can be found on this cd.  And of course, the singles that came off of it--Ode to My Family, Zombie, I Can't Be With You and Ridiculous Thoughts are all amazing, as well.<BR>Although basically any album by the Cranberries is totally worth listening to, this one is arguably their best.<br />Hard to believe this CD is actually ten years old.  I guess good music never gets old.
B00001IVOF|5.0|When I first heard about Mobb Deep in 7th grade all I had to do was listen once and immediately notice that Mobb Deep is a New York version of Outkast. Havoc knows how to make a name for himself by his sound and his flow, while Prodigy raps perfectly on every track along with Havoc and other New Yorkers. Not only is Prodigy a great MC but somehow the guest rappers always shine on their track. On \\"Extortion\\" Method Man simply gives you one his best flow since the TICAL CD. Same goes with \\"Nighttime Vultures,\\" when another Wu-Tang member Raekwon the Chef also break the mic in half. On \\"Give It Up Fast\\" they collabo with Queensboro neighbor Nas, and as always ESCOBAR shines. On the Infamous album Prodigy showed he has lyrics and can compete with the best in the city that never sleeps. On Hell On Earth he shows the world that he's grown up in his lyrics. After listening to \\"Apostle's Warning\\" Havoc proved to me that he can make another complete LP with murderous beats. This is by far on the best Hip-Hop album to ever come out next to Enter The 36 Chambers, Life After Death, Liquid Swords, Ironman, and Only Built For Cuban Linx. I think it compares to these CD's because it just won't disappoint you from begining to end. (No matter how many times you listen to it.)
B0000DCGT0|1.0|This was the worst piece of you know what I have ever watched! 45 min into the film there was still no mention of &quot;the&quot; horse. It was extremely boring until the horse came into the picture and then it was only so-so. My family and I had a hard time keeping track of the characters due to the fact that the film jumped around so much. I would have turned it off after the first hour but felt obligated to watch it at least once since we shelled out the money. Don't waste your time!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|i didnt buy the first alicia keys album but i wish i had now! From hearing just &quot;you dont know my name&quot; i knew i had 2 have it and that one song that made me buy the album didnt do it justice!<br />My personal favourites on this album are &quot;diary&quot;, &quot;if i was your woman&quot; and &quot;so simple&quot; which are instant classics. Im not saying there arent any &quot;skip&quot; tracks on this album because i feel there are, albeit only a few. The songs that i feel are a bit of a let down are &quot;dragon days&quot;, &quot;streets of new york&quot; and &quot;heartburn&quot; but i feel the rest of the album is so exceedingly good that this album still deserves the rating i gave it. <br />If you love music to unwind to then this is the album for you, its totally worth the money, i cant stop playing it!
B00005JKNF|2.0|It's always nice to see a book or DVD hotly contested in its praise or in its criticism. Those who enjoyed it call it &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;artistic.&quot; Those who did not enjoy it call it &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;tedious.&quot; And the reviews of those of the latter group, regardless of how well they are written, seem to fall under the sword of the former with 5 out of 19's and 1 out of 13's in the &quot;did this review help you?&quot;<br />This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. And the giveaway, if you will, that those who &quot;loved&quot; it feel the haunting presence that the naysayers 'might be right,'is that there are any number of &quot;loved it&quot; reviews who acknowledge that they had to see it twice.<br />Golly. I don't want to see a movie twice. I don't want to read a book twice. Perhaps I am in a minority but I think that the quid pro quo of my paying money to the investors of the effort by seeing it or reading it is that I ought to be able to 'get it' the first time.<br />In Hollywood (I don't know, I have to imagine) we make excellent, powerful movies that (a) are palatable to the public (art); and (b) make money for the investors. These movies are American movies.<br />At the risk of sounding xenophobic, what we don't do well is make French movies. Or Swedish movies. Or movies about Danish teenagers. And we don't make movies about the British class system very well at all.<br />Everything about the movie is true. Maggie Smith is a delight. The photogrophy is lush. The music is enthralling.<br />Regretably, the other things are true as well. If we had to wait any longer for Michael Gambon to die, the poor bloke would have died of old age. The dialogue, when it can be understood, doesn't carry any meaning. It doesn't make sense. Literally, who cares? This is a murder mystery. Purportedly, Michael did a naughty and he's going to pay for it. Let's off the bugger and be on with it.<br />Bloody awful!
B00005JLWN|4.0|In the future, a majority has been taught that emotions are the root to all evil and they now must be eradicated by the government through a police force lead by the Clerics.  Anything that can cause emotion is to be exterminated or taken in for investigation such as art, books, music, and people with knowledge of feelings.  The people are controlled by Prozium, a mind-numbing medication that controls emotions.  However, when Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) loses his partner and repressed memories begin to haunt his sleep, he decides to see what happens if he does not take the Prozium.  Equilibrium is a dark film about a possible future that promotes thoughts about our current freedoms in the western world; however, it also offers some action packed sequences that will keep the sleepy awake.  In the end, Equilibrium offers a solid cinematic experience.
0385504209|3.0|The book as a whole is well written but on the first page of the book, Mr. Brown implies that all material research is truthful and highly accurate.  After researching several of the organizations and  researching the Gospel of Mary Magdelene and researching the Da Vinci picture of the Last Supper, I found that Mr. Brown had taken an immense amount of Artistic License with little fact about the actual organizations.  Especially if the organizations were related to the Catholic Faith.  I also have found after reading several of Mr. Browns books that he seems to have a personal vendetta against the Catholic Church that comes through all of his books that I have read to date.  If Mr. Brown had not implied that the research done on this book was truthful and accurate, I would have recommended that anybody read the book as an enjoyable read of fiction.  I just can't recommend the book knowing that people will believe what He says about the organizations in the book.  I won't get into a debate about the implication that Jesus had descendants or that the Holy Grail are his descendents.  If you  could stomach the movie \\"The last temptation of christ\\", you will probably stomach this book.  Just keep in mind that as inaccurate as \\"The last temptation of Christ\\" is, so is this book.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I can't bear to listen to this band anymore, much as I like their overall thing, and what used to be their approach to music.  They have stopped growing, and their music has become cliche and boring.   I have every one of their albums and have seen them live many times, but I think it is over for them.   I thought when Jordan Rudess joined they would have a resurgence in creativity, but alas, they are going backwards/sideways to some place that is not good for me at least.  <br />Scenes and part of Degrees was bordering on brilliance, but the rest of Degrees started the downward decay toward shredding for shredding's sake.   Petrucci is a fantastic player, but he no longer tries, and Portnoy has become so eccentric (OSI was pathetic) that his bass drumming has taken over his life. And LaBrie simply cannot sing live, it takes a studio to cover the awefulness of his screaching.  If they let Jordan play and write some more, maybe they might come back to making real music, but in general, I am done with these guys.<br />Stale is not the word... this album is simply aweful.  These guys have gone from the most influential music makers in the progressive genre to shear noisemakers and thrashers.  They have become producers of product, instead of feelers of music.   Oh well....  it was fun while it lasted
055357342X|2.0|I had as many other readers great expectations regarding the development of the plot. Only I have come to realize that besides more murder and hopelessness there has been little advance in the story considering the large amount of pages! <BR>I fear the author started with a great idea that could have made a true piece of literature but that finally has become a product.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Peter Gabriel's new 2-CD retrospective, &quot;Hit,&quot; is certainly a great collection, spanning Gabriel's solo career from 1977 to the present. Many classic Gabriel cuts are here: &quot;Solsbury Hill,&quot; &quot;Games Without Frontiers,&quot; &quot;Shock The Monkey,&quot; &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; &quot;Digging In The Dirt,&quot; &quot;Growing Up,&quot; and many others. There's also one previously unreleased song, the great rocker &quot;Burn You Up Burn You Down&quot; (a leftover track from the &quot;Up&quot; sessions), the awesome &quot;Lovetown&quot; (from the &quot;Philadelphia&quot; movie soundtrack), and three songs from Gabriel's import-only release, &quot;OVO&quot;---&quot;The Tower That Ate People,&quot; &quot;Father, Son,&quot; and a live rendition of &quot;Downside Up&quot; (featuring Gabriel in a duet with his daughter, Melanie). There's even the lovely track, &quot;Cloudless,&quot; from Gabriel's &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; movie soundtrack. A very good, more-than-satisfying Gabriel retrospective, to be sure. But NO songs at all from Gabriel's 2nd album (which just so happens to be my favorite Gabriel disc)? This is now the second time that Gabriel has snubbed his second album, as nothing from it was included on his earlier greatest hits CD, &quot;Shaking The Tree.&quot; I tell you, folks, if I knew how to contact Peter Gabriel directly, I'd get him on the horn right now and say to him, &quot;Look, Peter, you really need to stop ignoring your second album. It's a wonderful album, man, so be proud of it!&quot; Also, nothing from Gabriel's soundtracks to the films &quot;Birdy&quot; or &quot;The Last Temptation Of Christ&quot; is represented, either, which is another unfortunate oversight.Nevertheless, &quot;Hit&quot; is stuffed full of magnificent Peter Gabriel music, clocking in at about 2 1/2 hours total, which is nothing to sneeze at. Whether you're a casual Gabriel fan or a diehard, this set is definitely worth purchasing. But what we Gabriel fans could *really* use right about now is a BOX SET, and one that features songs from ALL of Peter's albums, including the sorely overlooked second album. Peter certainly deserves a box set, and think of all those B-sides and rarities that would be on it, too...(*sigh*)...Well, until then, &quot;Hit&quot; will do for now.
B000002H6C|5.0|What can i say about this cd thats hasn't been said before it is a true piece of art. Eye of the beholders and One are the two most mind blowing song i have ever heard the cd captures you and takes you into this dark world. if you listen to it with headphone or with speakers totally blasted it gives you a sureal sound. i live the solo on one and the lryics are up there with fading to black.This cd is the best metallica cd ever made and it wont be topped. if you are not a metal head and want to discover what metal should really be like stop now pick up this cd NOW
B000000HRP|5.0|Brand X is the progressive jazz/rock fusion group that Phil Collins played drums for in the late 70's during his breaks from Genesis. Although there's no question about Phil's awesome drumming with Genesis, Brand X allowed Phil to *really* cut loose on the drumkit, free-form style. In fact, Phil felt that he had so much freedom playing with Brand X, that he momentarily considered leaving Genesis. As Phil himself put it, &quot;Genesis was the wife, and Brand X was the mistress, and I just wanted to take my clothes off and live a bit!&quot; However, Genesis started to loosen up musically around the late 70's, toning down their art-rock leanings and going more towards the rock mainstream, which ultimately convinced Phil to stay with the wife and say goodbye to the mistress.But Phil did record four studio albums (plus a live album) with Brand X between 1976 and 1980, and he also toured with the band in 1979 (though Brand X would carry on, off and on, through 1997). The group's first album, &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour,&quot; is a stunning debut disc. Phil, guitarist John Goodsall, bassist Percy Jones, and keyboardist Robin Lumley have musical chemistry that's simply explosive. &quot;Nuclear Burn&quot; is just as barnburning as it's title suggests, &quot;Euthanasia Waltz&quot; is a sparkling laid-back jam, and &quot;Born Ugly&quot; is funky with a capital F. Also groovy are &quot;Smacks Of Euphoric Hysteria&quot; &amp; &quot;Running On Three,&quot; the title track is a steady, assured rocker, and the closing &quot;Touch Wood&quot; is a samba-flavored beauty. Goodsall delivers some fiery guitarwork, Jones is a monster on the bass, Lumley's keyboard-playing is superb, and, of course, what needs to be said about Phil's drumming---he's fantastic. I wish more people knew about Phil's work with this outstanding fusion band. Like I've always said, Phil Collins is first and foremost a *drummer*, and if Genesis and Phil's solo work can't convince his detractors of this, then his astonishing playing with Brand X most certainly can. Not only that, but Brand X---Goodsall, Jones, Lumley, and Collins---were simply an awesome band. &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot; is a terrific debut album from one of music's best-kept-secret groups. Definitely start your Brand X collection with this one!tonishing playing with Brand X most certainly can. Not only that, but Brand X---Goodsall, Jones, Lumley, and Collins---were simply an awesome band. &quot;Unorthodox Behaviour&quot; is a terrific debut album from one of music's best-kept-secret groups. Definitely start your Brand X collection with this one!
B00000ILDE|5.0|This version of a classic sci-fi action movie is the perfect example of a &quot;special edition&quot; version done right.  It adds small, key scenes throughout the movie adding to the emotional attachments to certain characters and better developing the plot.  If you liked Aliens in its original version, you'll LOVE the Special Edition.  If you loved the original, you'll spend hours questioning why the special edition version wasn't theatrically released like it should have been.<br />Bottom Line:  BUY THIS MOVIE!!
0385335482|4.0|Hi, I am a young, yet avid reader. My mother originally bought this book for herself, but I ended up reading it before her.<BR>Now tell me, why is it that most of the one-star reviews are so...SHORT? Probably because there aren't many bad points in this book. The worst part is probably a few boring paragraphs that I found while reading. And let's face it. BECKY BLOOMWOOD IN DEFINATLY NO ROLE MODEL. The absurdity of her lies make the phrase 'The moon is made of green cheese' sound perfectly true.<br />Becky is in debt. Large debt. She is a financial journolist who doesn't know a thing about finace, she just copies phrases off finance brochures when writing an article. Becky also loves to shop. Clothes, Shoes, makeup. Everything. Her soon-to-be boyfriend isn't very helpful, as he is the one who introduces her to luggage. Something which she has never paid that much attention to before.<BR>There isn't a deep plot in this book. Yet, it is a delightfully interesting novel just the same. This book is unlike the others. It kept me interested til the end. I didn't read half of it and then lost interest. I stuck with it and had a exceptional ride.<BR>This is a funny, book which I adore. I greatly recommended it all.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|I first saw this movie not long after it was released at around the age of 12.  All I can say is that over the next couple of years, it haunted me in my sleep...literally!  I had nightmares about it for a LONG time.<br />Later in my teens, I saw it again, finally.  Didn't scare me as it did when i was younger, but I still appreciated it's raw gore and attempt to simply catch you off-guard for a good jump-from-your-seat scare effect.<br />Now, at 30, I had to order this on DVD.  You can bet I'm going to show it to my kids when they hit the age I was when I first saw it.  Will it have the same effect?  I HOPE SO!  If not, at least they'll see what scared the hell out of dad at their age and that's good enough for me.<br />I'll agree it has plenty of bad acting, a silly story-line and plenty of &quot;fake&quot; fake blood, but man, it is what it is...a horror film.  To me, this is just one of those pure horror movies that doesn't need anything other than what you see to freak you out.  Raimi did alot with a little in this one.  Late at night with the lights off and the sound up...only way to see this one!
B00005JMCN|5.0|One of the most inspirational and uplifting films in years.  Without all the blood and violence of most current films, it manages to capture both your imagination and heart.  And, it is a true story that has kept pretty faithful to the facts.  Seeing this film makes you understand why this underrated horse (who was written off as a loser) enthralled millions of Americans during the Depression.  Seabiscuit was the Prozac of his time, helping to make people feel good without the side effects.  The actors are all outstanding and the music is typically great Randy Newman.  This is one film you can watch over and over again when you need an emotional boost.  It is a real winner!
0792839730|5.0|War movies have come and gone by the dozens since this one, but few do what epics as this one did...go all the way.<br />Today's war movies are full of special effects, closeups and camera tricks that please the eye, but none seem to go to the grand scale that movies such as this and The Longest Day did with their thousands of bodies, tanks, trucks, planes, etc. on the screen...at one time!  The blood, guts, gore and pyrotechnics may not be as refined as they are now, but that is nowhere as breathtaking as seeing the thousands of parachutes and planes dot the skies as the operation begins to unfold, as previously stated.  Today's films will just give you a few at a time, albeit in greater detail, but it's just not the same.<br />Aside from all of that, there are plenty of top-notch actors in this movie, easily recognized as it's still not an &quot;old&quot; film, a very good story (it's history folks!) and several focal points so you're never bored with the same settings.<br />It's a pretty long ride start to finish (3 hours), but was never dull to me.  I felt it had a good balance between what went on while on the battlefield, as well as in the command's offices.<br />If you're a WWII history or movie buff, this one can't be missed.  If you just like war movies in general, you won't be disappointed...get it!
B000002UZ1|5.0|This album contains the best of the Beatles best years. Covering all the albums from Sgt. Pepper to Let It Be, this album is fantastic. All their #1s from the period are here, with all the classics. All four of them contributed to the album. This is a must buy for any BEatles fan.
B00005QCVY|5.0|&quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; is simply the best movie that has ever been made. Nothing else needs to be said.
0684801558|3.0|+ It's well-written, well-paced and a fairly exciting read.<BR>+ The atmosphere of a decadent upper class is captured quite well.<BR>- The plot is familiar, and the characters are mostly unmemorable. The girl is probably the best of the lot, but she's over-drawn. The guy (Anthony Patch) is too bloodless to be sympathetic. Everyone else is a stick.<br />So overall it's a good read, but not worth re-reading.
B00005O3VD|5.0|What a tour de force!!! Barbra's first movie is AMAZING!!!<BR>I think Babs was born to play Fanny Brice.  What a wonderful and<BR>beautiful portrayal of a young woman struggling to try to &quot;fit&quot;<BR>onstage and then &quot;makes it big&quot;  Of course Barbra's singing is<BR>just too perfect and her acting is amazing.  I think it is her<BR>best movie.  Her comedic timing in this movie is so natural that<BR>she should have done standup. Her comedy movies of the 70's<BR>definately showcase her comedic gifts.  One sad note, of course,<BR>is Barbra's character &quot;Fanny&quot; just loves Nicky Awnstein too much.<BR>He knows he isn't good for her and lets her go.  He really broke<BR>her heart. So, if you want a movie with vintage style from the 20's, Fabulous Singing, Dancing, Wonderful Costumes, and a great<BR>story, then please watch this movie.  It is #1 on my list.<BR>Enjoy.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. It is funny and adorable at the same time. My friends and I have seen it 5 times in the past week and a half; we can't get enough of it. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! The best part is Mark's signs! OMG that is so cute. And I love the Billy Mack song. I love everything in the movie! Everyone should go see it- numerous times.
B00005JKG7|4.0|This movie had the right idea, but something is missing. Its not as good as the classic &quot;Halloween&quot;, but I still enjoyed this movie and I feel its worth watching. One of the reasons why this movie still holds up is, there's no blood and there's excellent story-telling. However near the end of the movie, it feels rushed. But this horror movie is hella lot better than most of the Friday 13th movies.
B0000025HU|5.0|There are over 100 reviews on this album so I don't have too much to add to what has been said, so to add my two cents, this is a great album, one I play over and over and over
0316666343|5.0|i got this book for christmas and at first, i didnt think it would be an ok book but nothing special. You have probobly already read the discription of the book so i will tell of my opinion. It captures your attention from the first page and is very hard to stop reading the book as you get further and further. You may not notice the unique way the writer writes and how different yet good it really is until the end of the book. It doesn't tell you about her life because thats not the point of the book, but to show you what happens to those of who she loves. The ending ties a little bit too well but in ways it doesnt.The only thing to say is that, to read this book, you have to really understand it and the right age, like 9th grade and up. to find out if you like ti or not, you are just going to to have to read it.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said that this album was mediocre and to quickly go out and find the late great Eva Cassidy's work instead.  After reading the reviews, I wonder if the popularity of this music is less a vote FOR Norah Jones' collection of music or a misguided reaction TO the current music that is forced upon us by the music industry.<br />For those of us who play &amp; seek out this genre of music prior to Norah Jones coming onto the scene...we see this collection as OK but - believe it or not - overproduced, lacking a soul, &amp; flat.  To the uninitiated it seems like a break from current popular music BUT, in reality, it is still strategically produced, corporate music.  The music industry recognized the amazing, grass roots phenomena of the late Eva Cassidy's recordings - saw dollar signs - and simply went out and found someone with a &quot;similar&quot; sound.  Unfortunately, Norah Jones is talented but NOT Eva Cassidy vocally.  That would be like comparing everyday jug wine with a fine bordeaux.<br />My recommendation therefore is to initiate yourself and by all means listen to Norah Jones...but when you begin to tire of it &amp; Norah Jones fades away...go out and buy the late Eva Cassidy's live album to hear the original and the best.  You will pull her CD out time and time again for years to come.
0385121679|5.0|I started reading The Shining in 03 and finished in 04 and I think it is the best book i have or will read in both years and im an avid reader.there are parts in the book where I couldn't put the book down and read for hours and hours even when i had school the next morning.The book was brilliantly put together. I had stopped reasing the book for a week and when I started reading again I remembered everything that had happened. If u are not a big fan of reading u will still love this book if you dont then put the book down no harm no foul. This is a great peice of literature and it earned its place on my shelf. this book a psychological thriller is the best Stephen King book ive read so far but pet cemetary is next. So readers beware u will be scared!!!

0393316041|5.0|Richard Feynman is able to describe his unique view of many critical events of the the turbulent twentieth century.  From a Physics Nobel prize, to his work on the atomic bomb, his voracious quest for knowledge is patterned on his engaging personality and indelible pursuit of truth.<br />His descriptive vignettes are at time hilariously funny, at other times intellectually stimulating.  Scientists are not generally known for their ability to connect their personal<BR>characteristics with their professional interests, but Feynman<BR>is able to with a hearty aplomb.  This book should be interesting to scientists and laymen alike.
B00005JMFR|5.0|There's a reason that the Matrix sequels have failed to become widely-beloved movies, and it has very little to do with the quality of the movies themselves.  It really depends on what you thought of the first movie in the trilogy.<br />So, rather than do a traditional review of this movie, I'm going to list all the reasons that you, personally, would or would not like it.  (My own opinion should be obvious already from the 5-star rating, so I'm not going to go on and on about how mind-blowing and fun this movie is.)<br />You would probably NOT like this movie if...<br />1) You watch a lot of anime and hate it when Hollywood incorporates (\\"borrows\\") elements from it.  Specifically if you watch a lot of Dragon Ball Z--you will probably end up feeling like \\"The Matrix\\" is just a rehash of old ideas.<br />2) You felt that the original Matrix movie was the most intelligent movie of the last twenty years and merits its own religion.<br />3) You felt that the original Matrix was very unique and original and you believed that there was a lot of intellectual subtext that made it brilliant.<br />4) You don't like action movies, or are not in the mood for an action movie.<br />You probably WILL like this movie if...<br />1) You felt that the original Matrix was a success because it was a good action movie with enough style to be different.<br />2) You can get into a very traditional good-versus-evil story quite easily.<br />3) You feel that the intellectual subtext to any of the Matrix movies was really just a side dish and not the main course.<br />4) Fire + guns = good.<br />I've described \\"Revolutions\\" to friends as being the most loyal sequel I have ever seen; it pays off all the mysteries that the prequels set up, it uses the exact same formula that \\"The Matrix\\" used, and it is written/directed/acted in the exact same way.  Yet this loyalty is the ultimate cause of the movie's failure.  It's like trying to distribute your love--you only have a limited amount, and if yougive the original Matrix all of it, then you have none left for the sequels (especially \\"Revolutions\\").
B000002BYA|5.0|I always wanted this CD live at the carnegie hall. I just bought it today for a great deal. This CD features many other musicians like Jimmie Vaughan, Dr.John, Roomful Of Blues Horns, and Angela Strehli. The crowd is very loud its almost like being at the concert. This includes most of all his hits like Love Struck Baby, Cold Shot, and Pride And Joy. This CD has everything a music fan could want great music, and great musicians. 5 stars know go add this to your CD collection!
B00005JMF6|4.0|Gothika, the new thriller from French actor/director Mattheiu Kassovitz entertains for the most part.  It's stylish and sort of a \\"Sixth Sense\\" wannabe.  Halle Berry delivers a fine performance as a psychologist, who has a good relationship with her husband (Charles S. Dutton, oddly cast).  After a car accident and encounter with an estranged girl on a road, Berry becomes a patient in her own hospital.  Berry is accused of murdering her husband.  She has no recollection of the event, and her friend (Robert Downey, Jr.) is now her doctor trying to help her.<BR>    Gothika has its moments.  It does deliver quite a few creepy scenes, ones which you might not expect in fact.  Berry's performance is nicely done, giving the perfect touch to her character.  The film which was panned by critics, performaned slightly above average at the box-office.  <BR>    GOthika is rated R for Violence, Nudity and Brief Language. <BR>The violence is fair, nothing especially graphic or gruesoming.<BR>Not a bad pick.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The sequel to X-Men is awesome! I love this movie it is much better than X-Men. I especially like the Phoenix Storyline, it fully kicks in this movie. Jean Grey gets a heck of a lot of screentime, their are a lot of Phoenix references in this movie. The action sequences are cool, and the edge-of-your-seat surprising ending is great. To those who haven't seen this movie: you are missing out! Get the movie!
B00008PW2D|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the first four seasons of SATC, but I think people are being much too harsh with the fifth season.  I thought it was refreshing to see the women somewhat less focused on finding men and more intensely exploring their single selves.  Instead of seeing the series as flat and dull, as so many seem to, I feel like it's really growing up and coming into its own.  Miranda's new motherhood is fascinating to me (granted, I'm pregnant with my first child,) and seeing Samantha actually embarrassed by one of her indiscretions gives me a new respect for her character.  Actually BEING ALONE is an important part of being single, and I'm glad the writers, producers, or whomever, chose to include some focus on that part of the women's lives.<BR>Yes, the season was abbreviated, which is indeed disappointing, but if that's problem for you, either rent it or buy it at Target.  I only paid $29.99 there.

067144901X|5.0|Our son loves this book. We started reading it to him at 8 months and at 14 months he can tell us what all of the animals say.  He can't say \\"cow\\" or \\"sheep\\" just yet, but he can say \\"moo\\", \\"baa\\", \\"neigh\\" and the other animal sounds. I highly recommend this to new parents as one of the first board books to buy and read to babies and toddlers.
0312983867|1.0|I have read 1 thru 7. Thats enough! Its not funny anymore, the plot is weak and this adult woman can't seem to make up her mind whether she is in love or not and with whom. Grandma isn't funny anymore  either. Was that a Joe Pesci clone for the lawyer, as in Lethal Weapon? JE you can do better, just crank em out now that people buy them.
B000089RVX|5.0|Whoever says this cd is overrated is crazy.  Anyone besides me sick of finding a cd with only 1 or 2 good songs?  I happen to really like every single track on this cd.  Sure, Evanescence is a bit goth, but they're good.  I like their intensity a lot.  If you've paid $15 or so for a few good songs and a bunch of crappy ones, try paying $15 or so for this cd which is full of good songs.  It's worth it, trust me.
1400034779|4.0|This isn't your typical woman detective novel. You won't find the complexities of Nevada Barr or Sue Grafton. Instead, you get a charming, overweight, lovable woman in Africa who solves common, every day cases. From the case of a woman who thinks her husband is messing around to the case of a missing child, Mma Ramotswa gets the jobs done.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Many of the user reviews have stated that a lot of the instrumental work came from APC's current (i.e. live touring line-up) members. That is not the case however, as any person capable of reading the liner notes of the album will notice.<br />Maynard and Billy (Billy being the heart of APC, despite what many others think) are the two core members, aside from the &quot;one man drum machine&quot; Josh Freese that are leftovers from the debut album &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;. During the production/recording of this album, the original bassist, Paz Lenchantin, went on to form the band Zwan with former Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corrigan.<br />Jeordie White, stepping in after answering a newspaper ad the band had placed, took over the bassist duties. Most people who were fans of his during his days with Marilyn Manson wouldn't recognize his look now, but his talent is as fresh as it ever was.<br />Before James Iha, former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist, joined the band shortly before this albums' release, and their eventual Lollapalooza touring slot... the original guitarist from the first album, stuck around to contribute.<br />Before he too eventually moved on to tour with another popular band, Troy Van Leeuwen (guitarist on the first album, toured with Queens of the Stone Age for the latter half of 2003 on the same Lollapalooza bill that APC would share) added his guitar ability to the songs &quot;Gravity, Vanishing and Package&quot;.<br />Any fan of Nine Inch Nails, at least to the line-up that many have seen during their live shows, will recognize the talent of none other than Danny Lohner... who also remixed songs for both this album and &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, filling in on for quite possibly the breakout hit song on this album, &quot;The Noose&quot;. His guitar talent lends itself well to a song, along with a few others on the album, that he helped produce.<br />Many who read the liner notes will also notice that the ending track, &quot;Gravity&quot;, was written by all the original band members, circa the debut album. I've often wondered if maybe that track was convieniently left off of &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; while they planned to do a follow-up, before the rumors arose that the band had eventually dissolved... but only they'll know for certain.<br />Lyric writing credits for all other songs are attributed to both Maynard James Keenan (whose personal struggles shine through, especially on &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;), and Billy Howerdel.<br />One last point of interest to many fans of Maynard James Keenan, who might know a little about his personal history... I believe his son, Devo, was brought in to sing backing vocals on the song &quot;Pet&quot;. I could be wrong, but the credits in the liner notes don't seem like they'd be referring to the same group who gave the world the song with the lyrics: &quot;Whip it! Whip it good!!&quot;<br />Overall, any fan of the talented group A Perfect Circle, or the other members who stepped in to keep the band a cohesive unit, would be hard pressed not to at least give this album a &quot;trial listen&quot; even if they don't plan on buying it. The sound is almost unparalleled, and comparing it to anything musically (like others have deemed it &quot;Tool-esque&quot;) is giving it boundaries and understating something ingenious. The lyric composition, with the exception of delving into Maynard's personal struggles more in-depth than the Tool lyrics lean toward, is comparative to the near &quot;epical poetry&quot; found on most of the Tool albums. But without the music to tie it all together, you'd have no superb melody, no riff, basically nothing to separate this album from that of a poet reading his/her works' on a spoken word album/CD.<br />For any person yearning for something completely 'different', you may want to give at least one track from this album a listen, and see if it sates your appetite. With the exception of two &quot;album filler&quot; tracks, there is hardly a disappointing song on this entire album. Don't dismiss it as 'all heavy metal, or all alt. rock' simply because that's what you may hear from word of mouth.<br />Use your own listening ability, and determine if you enjoy what was presented so generously for your audiophilic pleasures.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Probably the best sitcom, ever!! Let's face it....we love Seinfeld so much because many of us can relate to so many of the episodes, right? I hate sitcoms but this is the one and only I will watch because it is so reality based!! Life is waiting in traffic because of a Parade; it is being snubbed at a Chinese restaurant; it is not being the one getting the very last marble rye; and, of course, loud, obnoxious face painters at sporting events.  Please don't make us wait any longer for the DVD's!!! Hey, waiting for these to come out, all of us feeling the horrible frustation, well, is like one of our favorite episodes!! PLEASE RELEASE SOON AND SUPPORT THE TEAM OF SEINFELD FANS!!!!! you 'gotta support the team!'
B000002NJS|5.0|THE SONGS IN THIS CD SIMPLY SOUNDS GOOD! EVEN LIKE FROZEN ETC.THE SONG FROZEN WAS WRITTEN BY MADONNA AND BY SOMEONE ELSE. SHE IS TALENTED TO WRITE HER OWN MUSIC. USA FANS LOVES YA!...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Anyone who has a love of science fiction and great character development will cherish this series.  There isn't one weak episode among the 14 provided here and this show's cast must surely go down in history as one of the most finely tuned ensembles ever to grace the small screen.  Each character bounces and resonates off another in widely differing ways.  The end result is a cacophony of dissonant perspectives that magically transform into a brilliant harmonic whole by the series end.  I want more!!!
B0000AXM3N|5.0|If you liked APC's previous work, this cd has a much more different sound. So please don't say this cd sucks until you actually understand why the sound is different, so don't really expect the same sound from mer de noms... some songs are up beat but not many.<br />Anyways heres what i thought...<br />The Package - 8.5/10 this song is slow at first then speeds up.<br />Weak and Powerless - 8/10 bad first single i think, but its still agreat song<br />The Noose - 9/10 very moving song<br />Blue - 7/10 I can't really say... didn't listen to it that much<br />Vanishing - 8/10 same as Blue...<br />A stranger - 7/10 I can't really say...i cant remember... sorry.<br />The Outsider - 10/10 this song kicks ass,its a must listen if you get the cd<br />Crimes - 7/10 its more of a filler then anything<br />The Nurse Who Loved Me - 6/10 ....wtf was maynard thinking when he thought up this song... its unique... i think its more a filler<br />Pet- 10/10 Another kick ass song you must listen to.<br />Lullaby - 8/10 its one of beginnings to a song...  but it leads into the last song... i am think.<br />Gravity - 9/10 also another moving and soft song, its a good end track.<br />In conclusion, good cd.
B000005IU2|5.0|No need to write a thesis here, kiddos.<BR>We don't need to be given analysis after analysis on why this band changed the world.<br />It just blows everything else away.  Any band after this album that didn't literally bleed for their audience was just trite.  That's how incredible this album is.<br />Think of your favorite band.  That band's favorite album is probably this.  I give it a 95% chance.<br />Once you hear Iggy's blood-curdling shriek on &quot;Tv Eye&quot;, you'll believe.  <br />It happened to me.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I was appalled when I found out that Britney made a new album. I was even more appalled after I listened to it. This album had absolutely no real music in it. Just some catchy dance beats with a chick attempting to sing. Britney seems to lose more and more talent after every album. Mabey she should just make videos for now on because the only way she'll make any money is by taking of her clothes in her videos like she normally does. This album is a waste of money.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|The best offereing coming from little miss perfect Britney Spears, In the Zone is worth a listen. IT DOESN'T HAVE THOSE MAX MARTIN CRAP SONGS HER PREVIOUS ALBUMS WERE FILLED WITH. It has a good range of musical genres accompanied by Britney's almost non-existent, untalented, squished, &quot;un-improving&quot; vocal abilities. There is still room for improvement especially in the tracks I've listed below.<br />Showdown- THis is the worst track in the CD. With a weak chorus and Britney's almost hoarse moaning, I recommend listeners to skip to track four and ignore this horrible song.<br />Brave New Girl- I must admit this song is quite addicting, but its too overproduced. Its cheesy and so &quot;Britney&quot;-like--edgeless. Its too electronic and lacks rawness. Overcooked.<br />I've Got That Boom Boom- A &quot; comformist&quot; track, trying to be hip hop rap. Prissy, little miss perfect Britney is too vanilla for a song like this.<br />The rest of the tracks are okay. My fave is Touch of My Hand. Over all, this album is good, but there are hints of Britney trying too hard. Her voice almost breaks in some parts because she's too ambitious in her singing when her range can't give that impressive belting. On the good side, we can see Britney beginning to be a true artist.
B00005JMTN|5.0|Based on what I saw in the trailers, I thought this movie might just be silly (for instance, the scene of the car underwater). I am SO glad we went anyway.  This movie is one of a kind, and has important things to say about life and love.  I truly didn't want it to end.  Treat yourself to a very special movie as soon as you can.
B00003CXA6|5.0|After seeing the movie & reading several reviews, it is obvious that the problems that resulted in the Civil War have not been resolved, & need to be addressed. I thought the movie was an excellent attempt to historical accuracy, while still making a small profit for the investors, on a limited budget. Massive sets would have been costly & would not have added that much to the movie. First time I have heard of 'extras' being 5000 volunteers & unpaid. Heresy in Hollywood. Although wordy, much of the dialog was gleaned from the letters written & saved from the time, & people did & do speak as they write. But by being less bloody & gory, its makes the film viewable by the very young, who truly need to be the ones to learn he 'lessons' of the civil war. The remaining problems still need to be resolved, & we must learn to forgive both the North & South for the transgressions of the other, & move on as a stronger, more powerful nation, respecting the views of each. This movie is certainly worth seeing, & investing in a copy for ones own home library, along with Gods & Generals, The Last Full Measure & the PBS series \\"The Civil War\\", recognizing that we can only gather as much information as possible, & each one make our own decisions.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I have long wanted to add this silly movie to our growing DVD collection of classic and cult films.  Thanks to all the reviews posted, I'll know to stay far away from this one.  One of the added major advantages to viewing DVD vs. VHS is the (usual) absence of ads and previews.  Being FORCED to watch them would cause my husband to blow a gasket.  I hadn't noticed the pattern being specific to Universal products in particular, but now that I see it here in print, I think back and I certainly concur.
B00008J4P5|2.0|I'll give anything a good try.  I often ask friends who they like, challenge them to name the artist's best album, then go buy it.  Each album gets plenty of undistracted listening time while driving.  IMO good music can be found in every style and era.  Any thread in our musical tapestry can be made special in the hands of a passionate, intelligent, and skilled artist.  <br />Unfortunately, Elephant doesn't make the grade.  It has its moments, but overall I don't think it or The White Stripes are worth all the notice they've attracted.  I've played enough guitar to know that several kids on your block can work a six string as well as Jack White.  I've tried to find simple profundity in the lyrics, but the water's pretty shallow.  There are a few sharp phrases, but most of the lyrics read like freshman poetry writing assignments.<br />My comments are just technical drivel though, searching for reasons behind the fact that most of the tracks simply leave me cold.  None make me smile, shudder, sigh, gasp, or react in any way.  Most of my CDs contain a few tracks that make me pause after parking the car to finish before stepping out.  Tracks for which halfway through I punch the repeat button.  There isn't a single track on Elephant so far that has yet struck me that profoundly.  So loud yet so thin and hollow.<br />I'll give it another few runs through.  Maybe it will grow on me.  Doubtful, but I'll post again if it does.  Sometimes a garage band is just a garage band.  Move on quietly folks, nothing to see here.
B000002LQR|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been together for 20 years now, and their career has been amazingly influential to the development of music. They have managed to blend Punk Rock, Funky beats and sounds, Heavy Metal and Classic Rock and made their own unique and totally beautiful sound. I have bought all of their albums but one, and I can tell that each one has had a great impact on me. I've worn each CD to bloody pulps, listening to them, and re-listening. Blood Sugar Sex Magik is their best album to date. <BR>Blood Sugar Sex Magik is indeed what the title indicates. Its filled with effort and hard work. Each song owns funky beats and great sounds. The album is hyper in a way, and uniquely \\"magiKal\\". Every song is work of art. Anthony Kiedis singing is amazing and his voice really shines through on songs like \\"Under the Bridge\\" and his mellow raspiness in \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\\" His song writing is usually serious, but often humorous, as in \\"Sir Psycho Sexy.\\" Flea is a great bassist, and his bass playing really shines in songs like \\"Righteous and the Wicked\\" and \\"Give it Away.\\" Chad Smith's drumming rocks, especially on tracks like \\"Give it Away.\\" John Frusciante sounds great on guitar, and \\"Under the Bridge\\" and \\"I Could Have Lied\\" are proof on his soft and soulful playing. <BR>By all means, I recommend this album. I love rock, and have records and albums from the 50's with Elvis, the 60's and the Beatles, the 70's. and Jimi Hendrix the 80's and Guns n' Roses, and the 90's and Nirvana. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are prodigies of rock and Blood Sugar Sex Magik is at the forefront of their work.
B0000U0X1G|4.0|This was a very action-packed movie. With a lot of amazing actors with the pleasant surprise of James Todd Smith known as LL Cool J who was great. While the plot was simplistic the  casting of the role of the bad guy Oliver Martinez was amazing foresight he was amazing to watch. This is a great DVD to add to your collection.
0385508417|1.0|Either John Grisham has taken leave of his senses or since writing his nunerous best sellers, this is what he now imagines &quot;the little people do&quot; at Christmas time.<br />The title captured my attention as I try to &quot;skip&quot; Christmas every year (with varying success). The characters are hollow and unpleasant with very little to say. There seems to be very little Christmas spirit and far too much oneupmanship.  But the most upsetting part of this sad tale is the totally dysfunctional relationship the Kranks have with their absent daughter. If my relationship with my grown children were as empty as the Kranks is with their daughter,Blair, I guess I too would see the &quot;charm&quot; that some of the other reviewers have referred to. I found no charm.<br />A total waste of time and money and i begrudgingly award this one star although had no stars been an option that's what Skipping Christmas would get from this very dissatisfied reader.
1869504917|5.0|We were in New Zealand last February when we found the version that preceded this one. It was a WONDERFUL book because it was concise, yet full of details. Each of the major sites was described with pictures, text, maps, directions, and even GPS coordinates. We went to about a half dozen of the sites, and loved the book as a companion to our travels. The sites are, in general, not marked, and we would have found them only by using this book. For &quot;Lord of the Ring&quot; aficionados traveling to New Zealand, this is &quot;must have&quot; book!
B00005JLT5|2.0|Even though I'm simply echoing stuff that a lot of other negative reviewers have said, I feel I must help counter all the mysteriously great reviews this film got!  Adrien Brody TOTALLY didn't deserve the Oscar for this -- hell, he hardly even has any lines, and spends most of the movie hiding like a rat, with an expressionless face, watching Nazi atrocities out of his window!  And (though this is not Brody's fault) his character is totally unsympathetic and cares for no one but himself.  All the Nazi brutalities have been shown ad nauseam in other, far-better movies like \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Life is Beautiful.\\"  As someone else said, I think this movie (and Brody) did well because 1) it's a Polanski film (whoopee), and 2) it's about a politically correct subject.  Frankly, I don't need any more movies about the Holocaust unless they have something new to say about it -- and this film definitely doesn't.
B00004Z459|5.0|No matter what anybody else says, Linkin Park is the best band ever. The way in which they can combine rock and rap is amazing! There is not ONE song that i don't like. And the best part is that even though they scream and yell in almost all their songs they do not curse in any song. They truly have a gift of being able to create such an incredible piece of music, especially in Hybrid Theory. They sing loud and fast that it makes you want to jump around or sing along with them. It is also amazing how Chester Bennington can continue screaming in the songs without stopping, he obviously has an incredible voice, and Mike Shinoda's rapping and rhyming makes you wonder how he can remember all those lines without commiting an error. The best part is the words always go with the music, and it's always cool. Each song is different from the other and special in a way. So no matter what anybody says Linkin Park IS the best band ever, they ROCK!!!!!!!!!
B000002U8G|4.0|This is a Brilliant Album. Very underheard by Floyd's casual fan's. This should have been their first BIG hit, instead of DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. While not as good as DSOTM, it's still excellent, and, really, what person could consider themselves a Floyd fan without owning \\"Echoes?\\"    It helps that the rest of the album is pretty darn good too. \\"Fearless\\" a very good song that I very much doubt anyone but the die-hard fans has heard. \\"One of These Days\\" is a fantastic way to begin an album, but really sets you up for a different album than the one you get. Heck, I even get a kick out of \\"Seamus\\". Who'd think that the band that performed THE WALL would let a dog sing a blues tune? For some rather inexplicable reason, \\"San Tropez\\" is also a favorite of mine. Very good for doing lawn work to.
B0000584V3|5.0|As an obsessive music fan searching for the perfect album, song, riff, whatever, i doubt whether anything will ever surpass this masterpiece. The gap between Opeth and every other great band is massive... they're in a league of their own. Your average metal band will use maybe four riffs in every song - Opeth will use at minimum ten stunningly complex riffs each song, effortlessly blended together. Add to this the alternately brutal and heavenly vocals of Mikael Akerfeldt and the virtuoso drumming of Martin Lopez. <br />The Drapery Falls is my favourite song ever...it never fails to send shivers down my spine. Opener 'The Leper Affinity' uses some of the most epic riffs you will ever hear and an acoustic interlude to die for. 'Harvest' is probably the most standard verse/chorus song Opeth have ever written but it is uplifting and depressing at the same time. <br />The only criticism I could make would be the bass playing of Martin Mendez...it doesn't live up to the standards of the other band members. What happened to Johann de Farfalla, the awesome bassist from their Morningrise album?
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one of those cd's that i could not take out of the cd player. Many people ask me whether i like this cd more than Hybrid Theory, and i can't answer that, i enjoy listenning to this one more now because i listened the other one to death. This cd just confirmes that LP is my fav group, followed by Evanescence then Finger Eleven. This is what i think of the songs on the cd:<br />1.Foreward: just a short intro<br />2.Don't Stay (7.5/10): this is probably my least fav song on the cd, the chorus doesn't do it for me, buti still don't skip it when i listen to this cd.<br />3.Somewhere I Belong (8.5/10): when i first heard this song, i didn't think it was a good choise for a first single, but have grown to love it since, very original song for LP.<br />4.Lying From You (11/10): THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD!!! you will not like this song to the max until u listen to it turned up to the max, TRUST ME!!!<br />5.Hit The Floor (8.5/10): a very good song, maybe the most rock song on the cd.<br />6.Easier To Run (8/10): this is the cd's slow song, if u can call it a slow song, i this the chorus ruins it a bit. The rest of the song kind of reminds me of &quot;My December&quot;.<br />7.Faint (10/10): EVERYONE knows this song! Amazing words, amazing beat, amazing song!<br />8.Figure .09 (9/10): another AMAZING song. It has a very crazy part similar to the one heard in &quot;One Step Closer&quot; (SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!).<br />9.Breaking The Habit (9.5/10): Exteremly touching song, even more original than &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, totally different sound, and was in the works for EIGHT YEARS by Mike!<br />10.From The Inside (9/10): This is their new single, and it deserves it, very hard song, good lyrics, and the video has a dbz resembling scene.<br />11.Nobody's Listening (9.5/10): used to be my fav song, this is the most hip-hop song on the cd, and the vocals by Chester in the chorus make the song complete!<br />12.Session (6/10): the only disapointment onthe cd. Doesn't even remotely compare to &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;. this is a pure scratching song.<br />13.Numb (9.5/10): used to be my fav song (along with &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;). A perfect mix of soft and hard rock made this song.<br />I understand that this cd won't apeal to everyone because everyone has different taste, there is nothing i can tell u to encourage u to get this cd, because if u heard the singles, and the singles of the last 2 cd's, and didn't like them, then don't bother getting this cd. But if u even remotely like rock (ex. Evanescence, Finger Eleven, Trapt, etc.) then GET THIS CD!!!
B00005U122|4.0|J'ai bien aim ce DVD. Waters nous fait revivre beaucoup de moment de Pink Floyd, avec comme arrire plan les pochette de disque des pices qu'il performe. Un peu spcial avec les choristes, son lead guitariste nerve un peu avec sa gomme dans la bouche qu'il mche comme une vache espagnole! Mais il interprte bien les notes  Gilmour. C'est sr que ce n'est pas Pink Floyd mais pour les fans je trouve ce DVD trs acceptable. Le film sur la tourne est  aussi trs intressant. Personnelement je recommande ce DVD au amoureux de Pink Floyd; l'audio est  son meilleur, et le visuel est trs bien. Il enfile plusieurs bonne pices de Pink Floyd...vous ne serez pas du car il faut se le dire c'est Waters en spectacle!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|let it be naked versus let it be<BR>the plus:<BR>-mucho better sound quality (guitars crisper, bass clean & sharp, harmonies more distinct)<BR>-includes 'don't let me down'<BR>-bonus disc \\"fly on wall\\" demonstrates how hard it was to be \\"a Beatle\\"<br />the minus:<BR>-erases all the hilarious spoken intros & outros  (wasn't this the 'original' intent?) (beatles 'live' in studio)<BR>-missing the sublunary \\"maggie may\\"<BR>-sequencing 'feels' funny<BR>- why no other outtakes? (i.e. child of nature etc)<BR>- wildly unimaginative cover<BR>- the 2 missing  Beatles really didn't have a say about all this
B00008H2LB|5.0|Amazingly Linkin Park has been able to keep it's fire going with their 2nd album \\"Meteora\\". The tittle even sounds strong. But the real fire is inside, inside the music, each song has a strong message for the listener, about emotions,feelings. That's what Linkin Park focuses on in it's songs. For example, in \\"Somewhere i belong\\", \\"Faint\\", or in \\"Numb\\", they all focus in emotions and feelings, not that that's bad, it's really good! Many may think that if you sing about feelings it may be a ... song, but NO! Linkin Park is able to express their messages by turning it into Rock/Rap, with wonderful rhyming words and Chester Bennington's yelling and screaming adds a whole new twist to the song. You can't get bored of LP, there music makes you want to jump around or sing along. It is amazingly a Cd full of excitement, and although they express it in rage or anger they never lose the music's touch. It is incredible how Chester can keep screaming without loosing his voice, without doubt he is the best singer in the world, and how Mike Shinoda can do all that rhyming and rapping without slowing down is just amazing. Linkin Park IS, and always will be the best band Ever!!! So buy their cd Meteora or Hybrid Theory, you wont regret it!!!!!!1
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A concert performed on November 29th , 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall for the late George Harrison. Terrific concert DVD. It became a special concert after Paul McCartney stepped to the stage and said his words that sort of made everyone refocus on why they were all there. From there on the show became very special.     I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the Monty Python segment feeling a bit out of place. It actually slowed things down a bit but the \\"George's Band\\" musical performances with Clapton , Billy Preston , Dhani Harrison and others came after that and the performances are so superb that it totally makes this 2 disc DVD worth purchasing. One of the best concert DVD's on the market right now.
B000055X3U|5.0|This is the album that got me into melodic doom metal - but this is NOT a metal album. This is 60 minutes of the most emotionally powerful music ever made - is there any band that can claim to ooze so much beauty or sadness in every note? Vincent Cavanagh possesses arguably the best voice in rock/metal. Songwriting duties are shared by the whole band making for a diverse album yet each track contains a similar distinctive sense of melody.     There's dark, haunting tracks like 'Deep' and 'Forgotten Hopes', gentle piano ballads 'Parissienne Moonlight' and '2000 and Gone' and the awesome cathartic epics 'One Last Goodbye' and 'Emotional Winter'. The female vocals on several tracks are a great complement to Vincent's voice. The lyrics are, as noted by several other reviewers, woeful but they sound a lot more respectable coming from Vincent.    It still amazes me how underrated Anathema are - whilst retaining the musical complexity and emotion to appeal to metal fans, I've gotten many friends into this album who don't listen to anything but chart music. It's very accessible to listen to, provided you're not expecting simple, happy songs.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|The songs on this album are ALL about Britney herself. Songs about centering herself in &quot;Me&quot; against the music,  immature and stupid cheat on Justin...WHO CARES about stupid mistakes you made in your life which you constantly denied??!! Britney's fame came from the innocent/sweet image she had, and she's running out of that. I don't know why Britney forgot HOW she got famous in the FIRST Place.  This whole CD has no souls in it. It really makes me sick even listening through it once. This CD will eventually go to your trash can when you clean your room&lt;-- that I can guarantee.  Why do people listen to Britney who's so conceited even produced a CD to worship herself!!!!
B00005JL3A|4.0|...the commentary is even more entertaining than the movie.  Suprisingly, Milla comes off very immature and annoying (\\"can I just say? can I just say?\\"...), which are personality traits that I wouldn't normally associate with the model stereotype.  Because she's a sex symbol, I somehow can't help but be amused by her obnoxiousness (i.e. the \\"gas controversy\\" when she collapses in the shower).  Michelle points out her favorite weapons and \\"sick\\" scenes, while joking about Eric Mabius's pepper and yogurt binging.  The James Purefoy comparison to James Bond is equally funny at the right moments.  Although the commentary group's timing can be off, the facts concerning movie production are also appropriately balanced (i.e. the Alice in Wonderland analogy).  Overall, they just seem like a fun group to make a movie with- you can tell they enjoy eachother's company. There are many memorable lines and scenes that become the joke subjects of the actresses, director, and producer.  If you haven't been a fan of commentary yet than try it out on Resident Evil, where getting drunk on set and nude shots are better than stupid color grading.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I wanted to review this album within the first week of purchasing it, but I waited. Why? I wanted to give a proper, educated review. So, having said that, let me tell you about Dance of Death.<br />This is an amazing album. When I first listened to it, I was a little unsure. It had to grow on me. I couldn't understand why so many people seemed to like Montsegur. Of course, after hearing the album a few times, that changed. In fact, my whole feeling towards the album changed. I like it more and more each time I listen to it. Every time I hear it, I discover something new and exciting that I didn't notice before. <br />Wildest Dreams - Why was this the single? It's a great song, but definitely the weakest on the album. It's so light that it takes away from the majesty of the other songs.<br />Rainmaker - Instant and powerful classic. I love this song, and especially the video. I just wish the lyrics could have been a little... deeper. It starts off really song, but then goes towards the border of being repetitive.<br />No More Lies - Another instant classic. Sometimes I think this is the best song on the album. Only Bruce could do a song like this so well. When he begins to sing &quot;No More Lies&quot;, it just brings more power to the entire album as a whole. <br />Montsegur - Amazing. It grows on you so fast. It's the heaviest song on the album. It took me a little while to get into it, but once I did, I found myself really liking it.<br />Dance of Death - The only thing wrong with this almost perfect song is that it gets a little too fast before it ends. That's a minor complaint though. This is one of the best Maiden songs of all time.<br />Paschendale - Again, this is one of the best Maiden songs of all time. It's an awesome story and I love the lyrics. Bruce sounds amazing on it. <br />Journeyman - Hearing it makes me want an entire album like this! I liked this song right from the first time I heard it. It's slow and it demonstrates why Bruce Dickinson is the greatest and most powerful Rock/Metal singer there has ever been. This song is reason enough to buy the album.<br />Face in the Sand - Another classic. It's a reminder of why Maiden are as great as they are.<br />New Frontier - This song continues to grow on me. I can tell that Nicko had a strong influence on this song, based on the values that it contains. <br />Gates of Tomorrow - This song has parts where Bruce is singing with himself. It does not get better than that. This is another strong, core song on the album. If there weren't so many other amazing songs on this album, Gates of Tomorrow would be a major hit.<br />Age of Innocence - This is a really good song, but it does get a little repetitive as well. Don't get me wrong though, it's still better than pretty much everything else that came out this year!<br />The rest of the album is really amazing. It's a mature, yet raw album. Listening to it, I feel the same sense of excitement that I felt on Number of the Beast. <br />I'm sorry, but I think this is the best Maiden album to date. It's got classic written all over it. The lyrics may not be their best, but the music certainly is. Yes, the bass and drums might be a little less noticeable, but the album itself more than makes up for it. <br />As for people even comparing this to St. Anger... that's like comparing Iron Maiden to Celine Dion. They don't even belong on the same sentence together. I couldn't stand St. Anger. 2 good songs do not make a good album.
B00005JMFO|4.0|this movie seems to remind England's citizens there are reasons to be proud of who they are. I like it. It's good to see english movies for a change and I recomend the movie. I particularly appreciate the Portuguese woman and the young Englishman who flies to America. The prime minister's speech in the press conference is meaningful specially in these days.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys is a true powerhouse in the music biz. Not only does she sing but she writes, produces, and arranges all her songs. I admire an artist whenever they do that. &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys&quot; is truly a musical masterpiece. It is an album that will be remembered for quite some time. The hip-hop/R&amp;B tracks are wicked especially &quot;Karma&quot; which is off the hook. But what draws me to Alicia are her soulful ballads like &quot;Wake Up&quot; and &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;. This is hands down the best album of 2003.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I love every song on this soundtrack ,especially the Top Gun Anthem. It is a great piece of music, and I'm glad it's on the CD. Some of these songs aren't that popular, but once you hear the CD a few times you should love it.  Most of these songs carry so much energy, it makes you feel like you are in the movie.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Congrats to Eric Clayton and all the gang of George Harrisons friends. A job well done, great video and a very good audio. I wished more people would put that much effort into making a concert for we dvd concert heads....KUDO'S to Brits, and the few Yanks for making this tribute video...<br />I really have no negative feed back to give on this dvd,they also kept the crowd noise down, so you hear the songs..<br />Anyone that loves to hear and see 3 sets of traps(drums) working in harmony, and 8 lead guiters working together, it's amazing... BUY IT!!
0385335482|5.0|This is a wonderfully sumputous witty novel. I could't put it down and was sad when I'd finished the series. The only complaint I have is that I often found Becky (the main character) intensly annoying because of her insane shopping and rufusal the acknowledge here mounting credit card bills. Thinking they would just pay themselves. But this does not diminish the fact that this is a wonderful book for everyone. Full Marks!!!!!
B00006RU5B|4.0|I thought this CD was awesome!!! Not one of the ones I couldn't stop listening to (that's why I gave it 4 stars) but a good CD anyway.  I liked the thought out lyrics and the great guitar parts.  I liked the up beat tempo of the music.  I highly recommend this CD to any rock fan.  On the other hand I do think the second CD will be better.
0782008119|4.0|I don't habitually relish watching documentaries, because I've barely found any that I enjoy viewing, that does not include &quot;Hype!&quot; They mention an immense amount of good bands and interesting facts about them in this excellent film. I missed the first fifteen minutes of the movie and don't recall seeing anything about Nirvana in this. It is a satisfying documentary about grunge music, but would probably be tedious to someone not interested in it's roots.
B000059XYL|5.0|This movie is about a shy girl, Violet, who moves away from home in New Jersey and goes to live in New York.  She makes the move to help further her music writing career.  In the process she takes a job at a bar, Coyote Ugly, and sheds her shyness as she sings and dances at the bar.  She meets a boy, Kevin, who helps her to get over her fear of singing in front of others.  The music by Lee Ann Rhimes adds great taste to the movie.  I think it is a great movie because of the characters and excellent plot.  It is definately a movie to watch over and over.
B00009UW0N|4.0|They had their chance to get it right and they blew it. They didn't include the outakes shown in the original TV version! They have the original extended TV version avaible but who wants to buy another DVD or VHS for full price for just an extra 10 minutes and in mono sound? Not me. This 25 anniversary DVD would have been even better if they would have just included the extended version or at least the outake clips. Oh well. Maybe they will release another Special Edition with the outakes. It wouldn't suprise me.
B00005OM4N|4.0|It's really hard to write good descriptions of Britney's CDs. They all have the same up beat, dance floor friendly formula that grows artistically each time. So that would mean that 'Britney' is basically the same formula, only with a bit more maturity. This is her best effort so far. Well, I haven't heard In The Zone and chances are I never will because I'm not buying anything else by this Madonna butt-kissing little sneak. She has sunk to a new low these days and I'm through with her. I just listen to this and her last two CDs. And I very rarely do that. This is how I rate each song:<br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U - TOO SEXUAL. And it isn't that good in every other aspect, either. I dunno why everyone loves this song so much. 2 1/2 stars<br />2. Overprotected - Not too much to say about this one. Loved it at first but the clutter began to bother me. It's still good, though. 4 stars<br />3. Lonely - One of the best songs on the album. 5 stars<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - I think this is her best ballad to date. Plus, this is the only song she can actually sing live! WOW! 5 stars<br />5. Boys - I hate songs with no meaning besides going at it on the dance floor. The worst song on here. 1 star<br />6. Anticipating - My favorite Britney song ever. Great to listen to in the car! 5 stars<br />7. I Love Rock 'n Roll - It's okay. Her overenunciation of some of the words is funny. You always know when someone is singing Britney's version... 3 stars<br />8. Cinderella - I immediately thought \\"Lucky\\" when I heard this song. It has the same vibe. 4 stars<br />9. Let Me Be - One of my favorite Britney songs ever. 5 stars<br />10. Bombastic Love - It's really hard to describe... It's very fun and cute. 4 1/2 stars<br />11. That's Where You Take Me - I immediately thought of NSYNC's The Two Of Us (on Celebrity). It's okay. I usually skip it. 2 1/2 stars<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me - The guy she cheated on, former boyfriend Justin Timberlake, contributes his vocals to this one. The fake rock/r&b element is a little overkill but it's good. 4 stars<br />Let's face it, Britney doesn't have real talent. Her producers are the ones who make her music enjoyable. But this CD is good.this one. The fake rock/r&b element is a little overkill but it's good. 4 stars<br />Let's face it, Britney doesn't have real talent.

B000089RVX|4.0|I really like listening to this CD.  Each song seems to have a different tone to it.  I love Haunted.  It's so creepy sounding like a Haunted house almost.  And the slow melodies of others make you feel sad.  I think the trait of a good composer vs. a great one is one that can make you fell the music.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the lyrics seemed over thought.  Don't get me wrong themes of the songs are deep and meaningful but she try's to hard to fit her words into the songs.  Like she means to say something but doesn't have room so she leaves it out.  All in all I would tell anyone looking for good music to get this CD.
0385504209|5.0|With creativity and artistic flair, Dan Brown, weaves into this novel a mystery that is 2,000 years old and actually much much older, in fact, dating back to the Eygptians and beyond. He combines fact and fiction into a labyrinth that leaves the reader spell-bound and a bit disoriented after the reading experience. Hesitant to read this book, I thought, &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;, sounds too complicated to me. However, I was reassured by friends it was a mystery book, not a cipher text. I took the challenge and read it ...<br />This book turns into a nonstop adventure beginning with a murder in the Louvre, in Paris. It culminates with a visit to Isaac Newton's tomb in West Minster Abbey, and another to Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland ... intriguing places that hold the clues to solving the original mystery. Nicole Neveu, the neice of the murdered curator of the Louvre, and Robert Langdon, a Harvard professor of Religious symbology, are thrown together through an unusual communication left by the deceased, Jacques Sauniere. Very soon they realize the curator brought them together to reveal to them, &quot;the secret&quot; which solely he possessed. However, to prevent the wrong people from discovering &quot;the secret&quot;, he  shrouded it in unusual text, obscure verses, symbolism, and a mysterious box, that contained yet another veiled clue, an encrypted &quot;keystone&quot;. But the Opus Dei, a controversial devout Catholic sect also wanted to unravel the secret ... The clues to the mystery were hidden in Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, within ancient symbols from a goddess cult, and within the architecture of the Knights Templar.<br />This is one book taht will keep you on the edge of your seat guessing &quot;what happens next&quot;. It will twist and turn your mind, as new clues are revealed. You will experience more depths and layers than any other novel ... ever. It is an artistic masterpiece which questions some fundamental human instincts. Erika Borsos (erikab93)
0312319517|5.0|This is Forsyth writing in his genre with the same precision and excitement as The Day of the Jackal. His characters are firmly developed, there are stories within stories and he ties the ending up perfectly. Do not read any reviews, just buy it, clear out an evening or two and read it.
6305972591|5.0|This was a great film based off a short story written by Steven King. I have not seen the sequels( I want to, even if they got bad reviews)but I think this one is better than the rest. It's about some young kids who killed thier parents led by a child named Issac. Meanwile, a a marride cupple goes out on a vacction only to unfrotanoly lose gas in the cornfiled were the chidren<BR>are. Very good movie. Perfect for a Steven King colltion.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|I dont know about all the rest of you people who gave terminator 3 bad reviews but I really liked the movie. Ever since they announced the making of T3 summer of 2002 I couldn't wait to see it, then I read some of the scripts they had in mind it sounded like a joke to me. All I can say Terminator 3 is better than the matrix sequals. I'm looking for action in my sci fi movies the only movie that measured up to terminator 3 was the last release of the star trek movie. You gotta have a plot for a movie in the case of T3 the plot kind of sucks a little bit but there was so much action in the movie you forget about the plot. Did I mention Kristina Loken how I wanna F*CK her... Good job Mostow on making T3 a good sequal.
B000002BE9|5.0|Her voice is very mature and the music has an element of jazz It is a slower CD, her voice is calming and the lyrics are great.  You can tell she has passion in what she talks about without her screaming or whining about things.  She seems like she has been hurt in life and love.  All the songs are great!!  You can feel the music.  It's just to bad she only had one real hit.  She deserves more.
0790729725|5.0|This film is quite frankly a masterpiece of storytelling, and it does an excellent job of explaining how it might be to be on the inside of organized crime.  This is the story of petty gangster Henry Hill, and is based on his actual, true-to-life autobiography.  As Hill explains in the movie &quot;I always wanted to be a gangster.  To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States...&quot;  Now that's ambition!<br />Hill and his fellow gangsters (known among themselves as &quot;wise guys&quot; or &quot;good fellas&quot;) look down at working men and women as schmucks.  Why should anyone slave away and work for a living in a real job when you can make ten times more money (or a hundred times more!) stealing and playing the rackets?  Hill couldn't see one single reason to engage in legitimate work for just this reason.  For a time, for Hill crime paid and paid big.  This film chronicles gangster Hill's initial ascent into the prosperity of being a successful gangster, and his eventual descent into drug dealing, wanton murder and horrific violence, and in the end, poverty, jail, and betrayal.<br />The film is great entertainment, although it has sufficient really bad violence such that this is no movie for young children or even teens under maybe 16 years old.  The violence is pretty graphic, but it is not gratuitous and I will say that it is a necessary part of the story because it shows the terrible price that these gangsters paid in order to keep the easy money rolling in.<br />Ray Liotta is very good in this film as Henry Hill.  Robert De Niro turns in his customary subperb performance as Jimmy &quot;the Gent&quot; Conway.  Joe Pesci is effective as the rabid mobster Tommy DeVito, and Pesci's excellent performance in this film is what really caused his career to ignite. The rest of the supporting cast does extremely well also, making this film one of the really great gangster flicks.  While The Godfather in a sense glorifies organized crime as a modern day Roman Empire (as Tom Hagan refers to it in Godfather II), this film shows the mob's dirty, gritty underbelly of pointless violence, cruelty, and corruption.<br />The film never fails to hold the viewer's interest and entertain.  It is not for young children, however.crime as a modern day Roman Empire (as Tom Hagan refers to it in Godfather II), this film shows the mob's dirty, gritty underbelly of pointless violence, cruelty, and corruption.  <br />The film never fails to hold the viewer's interest and entertain.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|their stuff has a remarkable hint of pop-punk, but their sound oddly reminds me of the ramones, i can't help it. even though these guys are real punks themselves, i can't help but fall in love with this album. i'm so torn.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 is an excellent band that have been able to accomplish what most groups were never able to. they have created a sound so destinctive, so haunting, and so rememberable but, have always been able to keep a huge level of meaning in each one of there songs. this is in all there music but, its held most of all in this legendary album, The Joshua Tree. there are very few records out there that i would consider perfect, and this is one of them. i strongly recommend purchasing this album. you won't regret it.<br />                     10/10
B000065Q5V|2.0|When I heard &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; on the radio, I was hooked. I thought that the song was one of the greatest songs on the radio. I immediatley rushed out to buy &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, and let me tell you, it wasn't really worth the $20.00 I spent on it. &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and &quot;Too Bad&quot; are the best songs on the CD. I don't really listen to the rest of the CD, I just don't find it really good. Some of the songs have good guitar riffs, but the drumming in this band is just boring. I'll let you see what I thought of the songs:<br /> &quot;Never Again&quot; Quite boring. This was the bands third single. The lyrics are okay, but that's all.2/5<br />&quot;How You Remind Me&quot; There we go. A great song with good guitar riffs. Too                  bad the rest of the album isn't as good.5/5<br />&quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; I always skip this song.1/5 <br />&quot;Too Bad&quot; The best song on the album. 5/5<br />&quot;Just For&quot; Same as &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; 1/5<br />&quot;Hollywood&quot; A little improvement. Nothing great though. 2/5<br />&quot;Money Bought&quot; Same as &quot;Hollywood&quot;. 2/5<br />&quot;Where Do I Hide&quot; Another improvement. 3/5<br />&quot;Hangnail&quot; Always skip. 1/5<br />&quot;Good Times Gone&quot; Look at previous song review.<br /> All in all, not a very good album. But hey, maybe &quot;The Long Road&quot; will be half decent. You never know, &quot;Saturday Nights&quot; is a really good song. But then there's &quot;Someday&quot;...
B00005YW4H|2.0|I know I'm going to go against the popular grain here but it seems like the positive reactions to this album are less about its great content than it is about finally hearing something different than what is typically forced upon us by the music industry. For those of us not clued in to this genre before Norah Jones it truly may seem better than what it truly is...quite frankly Norah Jones is certainly talented but this collection of one-note music has been waaay overrated...its like listening to the same song over and over on each cut.      The reality is that record executives saw the incredible, suprising reaction &amp; record sales of the late great Eva Cassidy (from Washington D.C.!). So, they went out and found someone who had a sound similar to hers...that was Norah Jones. So, if you like the sound of Norah Jones you will be thrilled by the original - Eva Cassidy - but it's like comparing jug wine to a vintage cabernet.
0780631684|2.0|When I first saw this film I was looking forward to what I thought would be an interesting new thriller. Although it turned out to be extremnly violent and with an unbelievable story line. Ihis movie starts out wonderfully with the scen at the airport and the dream and then the plane crash.  But after the that its basically a gore fest with blood every 5 minutes.  After a few deaths (which I might ad are extremly random and could rarely occur) Devon Sawa thinks that there is a pattern to which these deaths are occuring, and basically the whole movie is just watching people die then watching people try to escape the death.  Although the movie did try, and the look of the movie is great the overall movie is a mess.  And before watching notice the R Rating this movie drops the F- Bomb thousands of times and many times its pointless.
B000085RTZ|4.0|Good production, good musicianship, good vocals, good story! Actually great story, but I dig fantasy and medieval stuff, so some of you might find this CD cheesy, in that case go back to listen to Creed aka the most uninspiring band of all.<BR>Anyways, for those of you into Blind Guardian, Manowar, Rhapsody, and now the newer awesome Secret Sphere, will love this new CD from Kamelot.<BR>My fave song is Wander, and NO, I'm not skipping through the all the intros, which actually make a better, more enjoyable CD.<BR>That would be too superficial.(someone else who wrote a review actually did that)<BR>I much rather enjoy every single episode of this story, and I wish there was a movie made for the CD.<BR>Classical music is mixed with power and speed metal, good arrangements and decent melodies, some I will be singing over and over in my car, until I'll be able to reach those notes (LOL).
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I have one question for the cast and crew for Matrix Reloaded. Why did you do to the series? The frist one was off the hook, and when heard there was going to be 2 more films I was excited, so I preordered it for 10 bucks. But when i was watching it i was thinking why in Gods name did i buy it, OK the highway seen was good, but the sex part was a waste of time. I just hope the 3rd is a pick better. But DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ARE A HUGE MATRIX FAN.
B00009V7RF|5.0|i come to this album from the perspective of a guy who has NOT heard black eyed peas before, but a guy who listens to pretty much every music genre on the planet, and is a part time musician with a functioning performing world music band. i believe it doesn't matter where a band came from, except in an academic (but no less important) sense in terms of tracking a musical journey. each musical creation speaks for itself, is complete in and of itself. in those terms, i find this album outstanding for the way it blends funk, hip hop, R &amp; B, pop and rock - successfully. I even - after much thought and sitting on the fence - like the faintly retro sound of the Latin tail of Latin Girls.  <br />trust me guys, this is an outstanding musical achievement, enough to make me go out and buy up all the CDs this band has released previously.
B00000IN5G|5.0|One of the best Children of Bodom has released, \\"Hatebreeder\\" is a fast, hard-hitting album. It is faster than their release \\"Follow the Reaper,\\" which was the bands next release after \\"Hatebreeder,\\" as well as their new album \\"Hate Crew Deathroll.\\" I like both \\"Hatebreeder\\" and \\"Follow the Reaper\\" very well for different reasons. \\"Follow the Reaper\\" has more of a haunting, melodic mood to it, whereas \\"Hatebreeder is somewhat brutal. You can't critize this band for lacking diversity, as their albums all have a unique sound. If you like any type of technical metal, Power Metal, Death Metal or Black Metal, you must have this CD. is my second favorite Children of Bodom CD, after \\"Follow the Reaper.\\" Buy this disc, and give these Finns the credit they deserve.
B00005JM02|3.0|At first I thought dis wuz going to be one of those stupid highly antisipated Crappy movies. Then my lil' Bro got it and I thought why not lets give it a chance!

B0000DZEA1|5.0|Okay, so I am a neo-crone nerd old enough to be a youngish grandma, the midlife result of a bookish kid who read and re-read Tolkein and his literary descendents.  You know how some folks cry at the merest hint of sentiment, even a freaking television commercial?  That is NOT me. My husband, my boss, my assistant, sensible types all, cry more readily than I.<br />Howard Shore makes me cry.  I have owned this soundtrack since the day it was released, and listened to it extensively before seeing the movie the first time (I recommend this, unless you truly do not know the story.  I have no idea how one experiences the film without having read the book; I do not know whether to pity or envy you, hmmmm...)  Each time I hear parts of this CD, it chokes me up.  Of course, having seen the movie deepens the listen more.  And vice versa, which is why I am going to see it again this weekend.  (I will be that very cool woman with salt and pepper braid and dusky voice who so intrigues you)<br />Marvelous soundtrack that grows on you with repeated listening and several viewings.  Highlights include Minas Tirith, The White Tree, Twilight and Shadow, the Black Gate Opens, the End of Things, Return of the King...well, I really can't separate bits out; it is a symphony.<br />&quot;The End of Things&quot; is getting far too little notice in these customer reviews.  It is a really remarkable choral-heavy short epictale.  I want the lyrics.  And a translation; I was not THAT much of a geekgirl that I wrote my poetry in Quenya. I did, however, embroider Greek and Latin words on my jeans.  Yes, this is how we kept busy in that wild, webless past.  Also marijuana (that you would not recognize today; my, what a few decades of covert botany can do!).  And we invented garage bands and ren-faires.  I sang with poor resemblages of folkrock, deathmetal and artrock bands (mostly the same guys), and did community theatre in the summer.  Proto-nerd and proud.
6305327041|5.0|Disregard Taube M. Cyrus and his comments about this movie.  He definently wrestled a while with the thesaurus in writing that &quot;review.&quot;  Get the movie, its great.  Nothing more to say.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a well written series with a cast of actors that perform brilliantly.  Firefly is a perfect mix of action and comedy.  It is the best science-fiction show I've even seen.
B0000640VO|5.0|As noted in my title, I would describe Amelie as quirky, fun, and charming.  Like his wacky film Delicatessen, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has assembled a deliciously quirky sensibility that encompasses the story, characters, set design, camera work, etc.  The quirkiness is occasionally surreal, but it is very fitting to the story, the mindset of the main character, and the Parisian neighborhoods that surround the story.  It's hard to frown after watching this movie -- it's a feel good movie, but the emotions it evokes isn't forced or manipulative like its Hollywood brethren.  In this respect, it is refreshing and lacks the vapid shallowness usually found in Hollywood flicks.  Even if you don't like subtitled films, or shy away from European films, Amelie is very accessible to other audiences (e.g., American).  Why?  The performances are very expressive and the humor translates well.  In the end, you will likely be charmed by the film and the lead actress Audrey Tautou, who is utterly delightful.  Very highly recommended.
0156027321|5.0|Widely hyped as a book that will cause you to believe in God, \\"The Life of Pi\\" perhaps is better described as causing a belief in allegory.  On the surface, the novel covers the story of Pi (ironic choice to name a devoutly religious character after a mathematical number once considered heretical), a boy whose belief in multiple religions causes consternation to both religious leaders and his family.<br />During the family's move to North America, Pi's ocean liner sinks, and he is forced onto the lifeboat with a tiger, a jackal and a zebra.  The book is the story of his survival, and eventual landing in America.<br />The book manages several dichotomies.  It is religeous, but agnostic.  It balances humor with sadness, a believability with fancy, and ultimately fact and allegory.<br />The story forces some thoughts about the meaning of religion, and importance and allegory.  (I hate coming back to that word, but it's the only one that will do)  At times I felt as a reader that I was being spoon fed pop-psychology about spirituality being good, and organized religeon being hard-headed.  At other times, I struggled with the deeper meaning in the book.  In the end, I'm not sure I \\"got it all\\" but I got enough to consider the read well worth the time.  Even with it's imperfections, it's a book that can change the reader.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is the best movie ever made!  Al Pacino is the ambitious young Tony Montana and comes to Miami with his best buddy Manny and also with Angel Fernandez.  Tony works his way from a lowely dishwasher to the biggest drug kingpin in Miami.  Tony kills Hector, Frank Lopez, Mel the cop, Manny, and million other people in the film.  Very depressing movie, it in someways reminds me of Titanic.  Both were EXCELLENT 3 hour long movies that both ended on a down note.  Watch Both Scarface and Titanic, two of the greatest and most amazing movies of the 20th century.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Cowboys From Hell is one hell of an album. Phil Anselmo is still kind of stuck in the hairband era with his occasional high pitch squeals, but still gives a damn good performance. Dimebag Darrell or then known Diamond Darrell loads up on some insane guitar work along with his brother Vinnie Paul on drums. Rex is an excellent bassist even though sometimes you cannot hear his instrument through all the chaotic metal of \\"Cowboys From Hell\\", \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\", \\"Domination\\", and \\"The Art Of Shredding\\". To the beautiful metal ballad of \\"Cemetary Gates\\".There is no denying that Cowboys From Hell is a revolutionizing record from a very unique metal band that was only giving us a taste of what was yet to come.

0060523808|5.0|This is the story of IBM's miraculous turnaround in Lou's own words.  I use \\"Lou's own words\\" with intent here, as there was no ghost writer or co-author.  The story of the revival of an American icon is written from the viewpoint of the man picked to do it himself.<br />The book is organized into 4 sections:  Getting Hold, Strategy, Culture, Lessons Learned and Observations.  (ok, so that's 5 sections)<br />Getting Hold covers Gerstner's initial immersion into the new environment, and his analysis of the problems.  He also covers his famous comment that \\"the last thing IBM needs is vision\\" and explains his view in the need for tactics and execution.  This flies in the face of what one might expect from a former consultant, and is consistent with other recent books such as \\"Execution\\" by Charan and Bossidy.<br />Strategy covers how Gerstner came to the belief that IBM should not be broken up.  This was in contrast to the spinoff frenzy of the times, and came from his view as a former customer that the market needed someone to pull all the technology pieces together, and that was IBM's only competitive advantage.  The strategy is covered in business terms accessible to people outside the industry.<br />Perhaps the biggest \\"Aha\\" in the book is the story of Gerstner battling the legendary IBM culture.  This is covered in the Culture section, along with his stories of how he tried to insure that his changes are permanent.  The importance of this culture change is highlighted in Gerstner's pride that his successor is a blue bleeding IBM life.  (Ultimately Lou admits that even after 10 years he was still an outsider)<br />The lessons learned and observations sections are less a narrative of the IBM turnaround, and more lessons on turnarounds in general, and the computing industry.  For students of management, this will hold the most value.<br />There were two downsides of the book.  First is coming to grips with some of the inconsistencies in the methods used to turn around IBM.  For a while, Gerstner rails against processes, instead challenging people to focus on customer needs.  While reading it, one wonders how a complex organization can integrated many businesses without good processes.  Later on Gerstner extols the virtues of his re-engineering project, especially along several key processes vital for turning around IBM.  Makes sense, but contradicts his earlier writing.<br />The other downside is answering why IBM needed an outsider to change it.  Gerstner points out several times that IBM was a great company that just appeared stuck in some bad behaviors.  Current management wisdom holds that insiders are better turnaround artists than outsiders.  Why is this the exception that proves the rule?  Is modesty the answer?  (It is generally left to the reader to assume that a customer's viewpoint was needed)<br />I would not let these detract from what was otherwise an interesting (and overdue) story of one of today's great turnarounds.  The material comes straight from the source (as compared to the story of Ghosn's turnaround of Nissan) and from an individual of much higher personal integrity than Sunbeam's Al Dunlap.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock CDs of all time. All the songs are awesome, deep, and very melodic. Their riffs and distortion, along with the often ghostly singing, blend together to create an experience that will not be forgotten. I prefer the mellower songs, and such, but even the faster tracks are excellent. AQUEOUS TRANSMISSION is hands down the best stoner song ever. You have to feel it to believe it... but you'll never come down. ECHO is probably the next best song on the CD. I also recommend: 11 AM, Are You In, Just a Phase, Warning, and well basically the whole CD.
B000000OUE|5.0|Things all came together for White Zombie on Astro Creep 2000. There were songs of love, destruction, and other synthetic delusions of the Electric Head. This time around though White Zombie sounded more commercial, not  the commercialism of selling out or anything, its just that Astro Creep sounded more like it fits people's idea of what hard rock should sound like in 1995. I was very pleased with every song on here. From &quot;Electric Head Pt.I&quot; to &quot;Super Charger Heaven&quot; to the spooky &quot;Creature Of The Wheel&quot; and &quot;Electric Head Pt II&quot;. White Zombie plays some really appealing songs. The darkest songs on here are &quot;Grease Paint and Monkey Brains&quot;, &quot;El Phantasmo and The Chicken Run&quot; &quot;Blur The Technicolor&quot; and the almost tribal sounding &quot;Blood, Milk, and Sky&quot;. It also contained the hit &quot;More Human Than Human&quot; which had some good slide guitar by J. and all around excellent performances by everybody including new drummer John Tempesta. Astro Creep 2000 is White Zombie in their prime and is their greatest and final studio album (Not counting Supersexy Swinging Sounds). Its too bad Rob Zombie's ego got the best of him with his solo project, because White Zombie were the Rolling Stones of the 90's in my opinion. And Astro Creep 2000 says it all.
B00006879E|5.0|Its been such a  long time since I could just put a cd in and lay down b/c I liked every song on the album! With &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; you can do just that!<br />Great for road trips!
B00008PW2D|2.0|Best:<br />1) Charlotte gets wilder (and even flashes a breast in the very first episode).<BR>2) There's writer/director commentaries on 3 episodes (from two feminine males).<BR>3) Samantha's knowledge of vibrators is absolutely hilarious in episode 6.<br />Worst:<br />1) There were only 8 episodes in this season - enough said.<BR>2) Too much time was spent on dreary emotional issues and forced sentimentality.<BR>3) There was no good nudity or hot sex scenes (and Samantha was just a big tease).<br />Recommendation:<br />The high retail price and low overall amount of humor or sex are big reasons to NOT recommend this season. If you have seasons 1-4 already and you can get this one for LESS than half price (used), consider adding it to the mix ONLY if you're a HUGE Charlotte fan and a complete SATC fanatic. Otherwise, wait until season 6 and don't feel bad.
B0000024RZ|3.0|This album looks and feels like a John Steinbeck novel. I get somewhat depressed just looking at the cover, and the effect increases when actually listening to the album. Dylan writes some solid folk/protest tunes here. It's nowhere near Freewheelin' but it's enjoyabie, although it's my least favorite folky Dylan album. Get this if you already have Freewheelin' and Another Side Of.
B000002JR8|5.0|Far Beyond Driven was Pantera's breakthrough album. It surprised everyone by reaching #1 on the Billboard 200. It starts out with the pulverizing &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot; and &quot;Becoming&quot;. They had a hit with &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot; which had some crazy guitar and drum work by Dimebag and Vinnie Paul. Phil Anselmo has totally lost sight of his hairband sounding yelps for pure insane chaotic screaming, which is a good thing because Phil's voice is a major part of Pantera's sound. &quot;Good Friends and A Bottle Of Pills&quot; is the strangest Pantera song to date. Rex plays some wicked bass and Phil goes into metal histarics. &quot;I'm Broken&quot;, &quot;Slaughtered&quot;, &quot;25 years&quot;, &quot;Use MY Third Arm&quot; and the cover of Black Sabbath's &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; make Far Beyond Driven a must own for any metal fan. It is strictly played in a unique and brutal form that no other metal band has mastered to this day.
0783226063|4.0|Arrakis. Dune. Desert Planet. More than a mere science fiction novel, Dune touches upon a variety of themes: ecology, politics, religion, messiahs, prescience, and ultimately at the core is a detailed study on human nature and how humans deal with larger issues, sometimes leading to unavoidable death and destruction. How to compress it into a 2 hour movie? Well, it has long been touted as folly to even consider doing so. But, David Lynch does create a compelling version within the constricted resources of an early 1980s film.<br />The casting is precise and entirely correct in all aspects. Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck makes for a rousing military commander that most would eagerly follow to whatever end. Brad Dourif (Wormtonge in the Lord of the Rings) is the perfect Piter DeVries in this early career role. Sting as Feyd Rautha Harkonnen, in one of his rare film performances (Sting fans will want to check out his cameo in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen) is deliciously diabolical. Kyle McLachlan is Paul Atreides. McLachlan perfectly captures the feel of the Frank Hebert character in the breadth and depth of his performance. There is not a single actor who is out of place in this film.<br />Likewise the overall mood of this film is entirely on target. This is a dark and dangerous time, the events taking place some millennia in our future. Rules of Assassins are common practice among political leaders and no one is suspect of treachery. Manipulation is the word to live by.<br />The words of Frank Herbert abound in this film. Most of the dialogue is direct quotes from the text of the book, unlike some liberties taken by the SciFi Channel mini-series. And most notable is the presence of the inner thinking of the characters, as we understand so clearly when reading the book. Voiceovers are generally a bad writing style when making films, but without them this movie would be reduced to a strange science fiction fantasy Lynch flick. Of course, for the 2 hour version you will get on DVD, much of the book has been trimmed. The dozens of plot points have been reduced to three or four. The most attention is spent on the first third of the book, constituting more than half of the completed film. That leaves little time for nuances with the remainder of the film. Hardcore Dune fans will feel a bit cheated with the second half. When I saw the film in the theatres in 1984, that was my overall feeling toward the film and it lingers today.<br />Dune fanatics will generally have strong issue with two or three directorial choices of Mr. Lynch. He errs on the grotesque and dark side of the film, making the Baron really twisted, but we know that Lynch likes to darken and twist things as much as possible, so this should be no surprise.<br />The armies are a bit pathetic. The \\"good\\" Atreides army really feels very Gestapo in style, and the Sardaukar in black, full body, neporene lab gear simply will never be a terrifying military force.<br />There is a scene, which is not in the book, where the worms come before Muad'Dib and stop before him. The scene IS in a sequel, The Children of Dune, with Paul's son standing before the worms. It's a great dramatic image, and as a filmmaker, if you are going to get only one chance to make Dune, borrowing from one of the other novels to underline a theme should be permissible.<br />Paul's ability to bring forth rain at the end of the movie, as if he were God, falls along similar lines. It makes a grand visual statement and forebodes how much change is truly on the way. Film can choose to illustrate a novel, and be precise to the letter of the word by being utterly faithful, OR it can do what Lynch has done and make a dramatic statement that clearly fits in with the underlying themes of all six Dune novels.<br />The most heated issue with the film, though, always centers on the \\"weirding devices\\" that amplify vocal sound and transform it into a weapon. These items are not in the book in any remote version or vision. SO, why put them in the movie? Perhaps because the film techniques that have been created recently with The Matrix, computer grphics, and spectacular fight stunts with wires, had not been developed in 1983/4, yet the book describes personal combat style that readers have been imagining, for the last 3 decades, to look, surprisingly, a lot like what we saw for the very first time on film in The Matrix. Perhaps the director didn't feel he had time in a 2 hour movie to go into the details of the prana-bindu training of the Bene Gesserit. The reason becomes irrelevant upon close inspection of the novels: the choice of a weapon that amplifies sound actually does fit into the Duniverse rather well, even if it is a major deviation from the actual book. In a world where laser contact with shields breeds subatomic fusion, and fast moving objects cannot penetrate a shield, perhaps the sound waves turned into a weapon might actually be effective. Perhaps this reviewer is more forgiving of the 1984 film in the light of the prequel novels that take even greater liberties with the Duniverse. By comparison, this film is more faithful to the original story than say, Dune: House Atreides by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.<br />An overview of the different versions: There was the original theatrical limited release, which was about 3 hours long, but got chopped up due to early critical response, becoming the general theatrical release version, which is the one on this DVD at 2 hrs 17 minutes. The Alan Smithee version put back in some of the missing scenes (full scene of Sting torturing Duke Leto, Halleck playing baliset, Halleck providing one of his rousing quotations, etc...), cut out some of the more grotesque moments (Baron pulling heartplug of boy, spitting on Jessica, Reverend Mothers coughing up blood when Paul takes the water of life..), and added a bunch of additional voiceovers. Which is the real Dune? Who knows?<br />Had I reviewed Lynch's Dune in 1984, I would have given this film perhaps one or two stars. Thankfully I have finally matured enough to look at it with new eyes. Twenty years after its theatrical release and this film warrants a solid four stars. If you can find the extended version (on laserdisc credited with Alan Smithee as director and with Japanese subtitles!) ;-) by all means do. The added scenes more than make up for the shortness of this DVD release.r vision. SO, why put them in the movie?

B000088E6D|5.0|This man has a voice and knows how to use it.  To me it is far better than most of the *crap* that comes out trying to pass itself off as music.  My BF likes this Cd and he listes to mostly Rap/Hip Hop. If he lasts or not, we'll see, but I'm hoping that he'll be around for a while.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is an indictment of 21st century television that an imaginative, smart, and stylish program like &quot;Firefly&quot; is left to twist in the wind, while reality shows that exhibit people at their worst seem to not only survive, but thrive. I watched the &quot;Firefly&quot; DVDs in two back-to-back sittings (sore fanny, but worth it), and the characters, script, and situations are humorous, human, and humane. I hope &quot;Firefly&quot; makes a successful transition to film - perhaps then it will be resurrected on the small screen.
B00007LTIB|5.0|This particular remaster of Relayer displays perhaps the greatest improvement over previous editions of any of the Yes CDs I've encountered so far. Finally, that annoying tape hiss at the beginning of &quot;To Be Over&quot; is gone!! Everything sounds so crystal clear, yet full at the same time. The hectic middle part of &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; seems to finally make sense to me as, with this remaster, it has become uncluttered, with each instrument shining through distinctly. &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; has never sounded better! <br />It's been said before but I must confess that listening to this remaster of Relayer is like hearing it for the 1st time. Amazing! Wonderful! Beautiful!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|First off there is no doubt that this album is way different than any of Britney's other albums and like every single ablum some songs are better than others and some songs are worst than others. Have u ever listened to an album and liked every song alike? This is a good album and Britney has worked hard on it. I like every song except for i wish the ballad everytime was more vocal. Who cares what other buyers write in their comments. Every person is different and theres no way to tell if u like this album or not unless u buy it. I am not saying u will like it though and im not saying u wont. But its cool and every song is completley different than the other. I am definatley a britney lover but u dnt have to be. Just spend the lousy 15 bucks or so and try it out.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Even over a decade after its inital release, this movie is still a thrill to watch. It still has kept its suspense and is still freaky and fun to watch. The visual effects are amazing for the time that this was made. Steven Spielberg is a great director. A lot of the scenes are amazing, especially the cup of water rippling, and the raptor looking in the kitchen window. The best scenes are the T-Rex chase and the velociraptors in the building. Although the scientific believability of the movie is iffy, I really don't think that the story is that bad. It's not too in-depth, but enough to keep you interested. The movie draws you in and you feel scared with the characters, and relieved when they finally get off the island. Arguably the best in the series, I really hope they don't kill Jurassic Park with the release of the 4th movie next year. The 3rd movie lacked, and I hope the 4th is better. I highly recommend watching this movie, you'll really enjoy it. Enjoy!!!!!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I see all of these negative reviews re: The Strokes and I feel compelled to share my own ideas. Yes, the Strokes do sound similar most of the time. Yes, their lyrics sometimes leave something to be desired. But I find their music engrossing immediately and it still has me listening X times later. I love the Strokes and Room on Fire only showcases the brilliance Is this It? introduced us to in the first place.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is definitly a must have for any Beatle fan, or any fan of rock music!  You hear the story from the mouths of the Beatles themselves.  From Liverpool to Let It Be.  It even shows music videos for many of their songs, including the new songs &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot;.  This is a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.
0385504209|2.0|Fact or fiction aside, I'm amazed that so many people are raving about this cheesy thriller.  Two and three-page chapters with holes in the logic all the way through -- how irritating.  I know of course that this is fiction -- why even argue the point? -- but what I honestly could barely tolerate in this book was the great big gaps in logic and sense: for instance, why would the Parisian police determine immediately that Robert murdered Jacques?  What would be the motive?  Why would they link the murders of the other 3 Sion members to one another, let alone to Robert?  Why would Robert trust Sophie to the extent that he does, this slightly madcap stranger forcing him to run from a murder scene?  On top of all this, the characters are not developed well (they just happen to be thrown into the same pot of soup) and the dialogue is terrible.  What I did appreciate is the background info, but even that can't be trusted.  Terrifically overrated -- don't expect much higher thinking from 'The Da Vinci Code' -- extra cheese masquerading as higher thinking.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This is in reply to the reviewer who likes Cher, but claims that Madonna put the &quot;D&quot; in Diva.  My friend, you are obviously mis-informed.  You are the kind of Madonna Fanatic who drives me crazy.  Yes, Madonna has remained (relatively) mainstream for the last 20 years--although she has had to stoop below &quot;sewer level&quot; with her ridiculous antics in order to stay there.  Cher is the one who paved the way for Madonna, and all the other Diva-wannabe's out there in music today.  Cher was re-inventing herself TWO DECADES before anyone had even heard of Madonna. Yes, Cher has had her low years too, but she has always been able to bounce back without resorting to open-mouth kissing of the &quot;teeny-bopper-du-jour&quot; in order to jump-start interest in her career.  Even with Cher's relatively subdued (compared to Madonna) lifestyle, Cher has NEVER had a problem getting publicity.<br />I know it is hard to face for the many Madonna Fanatics who believe she is God.  But, hate it as you may, the truth is: Cher is the one who led the way for Madonna to be the superstar she is today.  I've said it before and I will say it again: I will be VERY interested to see, in another 20 years, if Madonna can keep her head above water and remain relevant for &quot;40 frickin' years&quot; like Cher has done.
B000003BEV|3.0|This is one of the Rolling Stones weakest albums from their 63-73 heyday.  The Stones never embraced psychedelia successfully (with the exception of Paint It Black) and this album is valid evidence.  There are a few excellent songs on the album though. In Another Land, 2000 Man, 2000 Light Years From Home, and Citadel are all great psychedelic songs that must be heard.  Shes A Rainbow is a little light weight and airy fairy though. The rest of the tunes such as On With The Show, Gomper, and Sing This All Together are miserable, failed experiments (they are actually pathetic). The Stones were trying to compete with The Beatles, The Kinks, The Small Faces, and current pop trends.  This band was always more successful when they stuck to the blues, hard rock, folk, and country roots as Beggars Banguet proved. This album is worth owning but was basically a stab in the dark.
B00005JMCN|5.0|It took me awhile to get around to watching this, even though I had heard how great it was.  I love horse racing and I had planned on seeing this movie sooner.  The movie was really good and I concur with all the kudos it seems to be receiving.  The story is well told and script is good.  The acting is great and the movie scores as a big film even though it doesn't have the huge special effects or giant battle scenes so common in blockbuster type movies.<br />It probably isn't the kind of film that would appeal to younger audiences, however, and even thought the violence is pretty mild and the sexual content is just mildly suggested, they story itself involves an understanding above the head of most preteens and maybe a good portion of younger teens as well.<br />I mention this because it is a great family movie (with the appropriate ages) because at the heart of the film is a wonderful coming of age story.  It is the story of a boy becoming a man, and because of the plethora of coming of age stories that are more like \\"Spider Man\\" than this film, it is a true treasure.  I highly recommend it and while I haven't read the book and don't have an opinion on the quality of the translation or the historical accuracy of the film, I will enjoy watching this one again.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|My opinion hasn't changed much since I first saw this in Summer 2000. It's still an increasingly tedious no-brainer that has very little in the way of excitement or thrills.<br />I had hopes that it could be a rival to Con Air as Nic Cage and Bruckheimer made good with that movie but with GI60S there are no huge set pieces or ever-escalating chaos. Cage's character is lifeless and is poorly motivated. The villain is probably the most unscariest bad guy since the big rubber shark in Jaws 4. And the rest of the supporting cast are put to no use, included Angelina Jolie who is totally wasted in a role that means nothing. Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi and Vinnie Jones are also put to no use.<br />That's another problem with the movie. There are far, far too many extraneous characters who do nothing to complicate the simple plot in any slight way.<br />Dominic Sena's direction mimics Michael Bay (who was already mimicking the Brothers Scott) and gives us that highly polished Jerry Bruckheimer shine. IE It's always sundown in long beach and when it's not the night is filled with neon signs.<br />Trevor Rabin, who made great music for Con Air and Armageddon, does a very bad job with the score. There are a few moments of what could have been something very cool but he takes the easy way out and scores GI60S with nothing but noises and musical chaos that matches the quick cuts and flashes (that passes for editing) onscreen.<br />The car chases (precious few as there are) do not entertain. The final showdown between Cage and Delroy Lindo (also wasted) quickly induces yawns and glances at the clock. And why did the final stunt have to be CGI? Real stunts would have been so much better.<br />Rent this one.<br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and is in Dolby 5.1.
B000092T6M|3.0|The protagonist of this movie is the Sherriff of Nottingham. Saddled with the task of watching over his kingdom while the King is at war, he defends the land from impetulant son of a Satan-worshiper. This thief is named Robin and slimes his way into forming alliances with several peasants and a noblewoman.<br />A few spoilers follow<br />Unless you were really, really concentrating on the movie or had no foreknowledge of the tale of Robin Hood, this could pass as a servicable summary. Let me get something straight, right off the bat: I love Robin Hood. I've probably read every version from the Great Illustrated Classics to the original. So, I'm probably being more biased than necessary.<br />So, first, what's wrong? I'll give you a hint. It begins with a &quot;K&quot; and ends with &quot;evin Costner&quot;. Don't get me wrong I like-- okay, &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; was good. Everything else of his was rot (except maybe &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, which I keep meaning to see). Like Tom Cruise, he plays the same character in every movie. Some scenes -- like the ones with Will Scarlett -- he handles adequately. Other, he botches. And let's not discuss his &quot;accent&quot;.<br />Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Sadly, while he gives his character a great presence, the writers don't give him much to do except make a point of not fighting and drinking.<br />Plot-wise, this film is lacking. Some parts make little sense (Robin's conversation with the evil priest, etc.). Others are too drawn out (the attack on the Nottingham fort). Some parts don't segue. As for the ending... ah, I'll get to that after I review:<br />What's GOOD<br />Alan. Rickman. Seething malice, practically spitting every word, maniacal and deliciously unpredictable, Rickman is the perfect villain (as proved in many of his other films). His character is (insanely) more likable than Robin! Robin is portrayed as being a whining little rich bully who has an awakening and tries to set things right. In the process, he upsets most fo the villagers' lives. The Sherriff is witty (&quot;Locksley! I'll cut your heart out with a spoon!!), smart, and dangerous. I was rooting for him!<br />The biggest injustice in the film happens at the climax of the film, where Robin and the Sherriff face off. I will warn you, this is a spoiler, but not really if you have any sense of drama. <br />*SPOILER BEGINS*<br />ROBIN CHEATS! In no way would Locksley have won, were it not for Marion's interference. He was an incapable swordsman who got thoroughly owned and would've died twice if Marion hadn't kicked Nottingham and thrown the couch at him. And he used a hidden weapon, something no hero would do. <br />*SPOILER ENDS*<br />Now, I enjoyed the cameos. Everyone knows Sean Connery plays Richard the Lionhearted in a small scene and yes, it's nice to see, but my favorite was Robin's father, played by Brian Blessed. Who's Brian Blessed? Why, he played Richard the IV (this movie's Richard's successor) in Rowan Atkinson's &quot;Black Adder&quot;. A very nice surprise, even if he only had a short scene.<br />Overall, this movie is average, typical Hoolywood fare. Rickman's performance is worth sitting through Costner's tepid acting five times over. A few decent action scenes, some humor, some tripe. If you're looking for a decent Robin Hood, try any of the other ones. The 1938 version is great, the Disney version ais more than acceptable ... I even prefered Mel Brooks's &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; to this. You have Cary Elwes who, despite being in a parody, is the perfect choice for Robin, and Dave Chapelle who is always hilarious. And heck, even the TV Movie &quot;Princess of Thieves&quot; has the succulent Keira Knightley (Rrrrreeaaaaagle! *a la Wayne Campbell*).
B00006HAZG|5.0|I really loved the first half of this movie.  It has a very young Daniel Radcliffe playing the part of David Copperfield.  He does a Superb job. Be sure you have alot of tissues for the first half. Also Maggie Smith as his aunt does a superb job.  &quot; No donkeys, No donkeys&quot;.  The lady who played Madam Hooch from the first Harry Potter movie was also in it.  She played the wicked stepdad's sister.  Some parts in the movie made me cry and some made me laugh.  All in all this is a great movie.  Don't listen to the person with the bad review on Danny and this film.  It was a great film.  Danny's acting in this film made you want to just hug the stuffing out of him.
B00008PW2D|1.0|Same price for fewer episodes and flaky writing.  Bottom line: unless you're a die-hard SATC fan, rent it.
B000094DUP|5.0|This album is sensational! Delta has a beautiful voice and breathtaking songs that will send a shiver up your spine! Apart from her 5 singles, my favourites on the CD are &quot;Throw it away&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Running Away&quot;. Don't miss out on owning this stunning album! Once you have it you will wonder why you didn't buy it sooner; I did!
B000003TAL|4.0|The record that put Sonic Youth firmly among the royalty of alt-rock.  The next record they made blew them wide open to the mainstream and had them opening for Neil Young on tour.  Bathe in this record, ideally while meditating on William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy.  Well accompanied by Red Bull and Stolichnaya.

0140187537|5.0|This is a beautifully written book ~~ and my second Steinbeck book. A friend complained to me recently that she finds Steinbeck a depressing writer ~~ I disagree. He writes realistically of the views that society has on one another and of the world. Steinbeck writes convincingly of people and this book is no exception.<br />The book focuses on Ethan, a descendant from the Pilgrims and of the whaling captains, reduced to semi-poverty by working for an Italian immigrant in the grocery store he used to own. His wife, Mary, complains of not having money to spend as well as his two children. Beset by memories of how it used to be, Ethan begins to look for a way to solve his problems. This book focuses on that attempt. Ethan is a lovable character ~~ he defuses every serious conversations or whining with humor, oftentimes at the expense of his good self-will and pride.<br />It is a journey into one man's soul and it's soul-wrenching as well. It makes you stop and think ~~ and you don't dare to criticize anyone because you're guilty of the same feelings of despair and defeat. Ethan struggles to find a way to deal with those expectations and dreams of his loved ones and still keep his pride. But it comes to a conclusion that he can't have both.<br />This may be a smaller book but one still grabs at your soul and your mind. It's a perfect addition to any serious reader's library.<br />1-3-04
B00006879E|5.0|&quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is an amazing cd!! Every song on this wonderfully written, catchy and entertaining cd is better than best. My favorites are &quot;This Love&quot;, &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Through with You&quot;. I would list everyone song because they are all my faves, but for the sake of space I'm listing only three. &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is a talented fusion of rock, r&amp;b and soul. Singer Adam Levine has a breathtaking voice that can sing any style well. The five guys in the band aren't artifical, Adam Levine(vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael(keyboards), Ryan Dusick(drums), James Valentine(guitar) and Mickey Madden(bass) write all their own lyrics and music and play all their own instruments. On top of being great musicians, the guys are incredibly down to earth, nice and polite. I'm not making it up either! :) I had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with guys recently after their concert. I have seen them perform live twice and I can honestly say they sound as good live as they do recorded. Maroon5 is an amazing new band with a unique sound. I would suggest their album to EVERYONE!!
6304595247|3.0|Peter's Kosminsky's version of Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS is true to the angst-ridden torment that is Heathcliff's life.  In the 1939 version, Heathcliff was played by Sir Lawrence Olivier in a subdued and sympathetic way.  In this 1992 adaption, Heathcliff is Ralph Fiennes, who plays his character as more sadistic than tormented.  Comparisons to Olivier are both unfortunate and illuminating.  Olivier was cruel toward Catherine and Hindley, but his cruelty was tightly focused.  Fiennes' cruelty is more generalized, almost as if he is lashing out at the world of which Catherine and Hindley are but symbols.  Fiennes in his animus is so over the top that he very quickly loses the sympathy of the viewer.  How one sees the development of Heathcliff goes a long way toward determining how one sees the novel or the film.  In the novel, Bronte has pages aplenty to prepare the reader for the many and extended time jumps to account for the rounding of Heathcliff, Catherine, and others.  In the 1939 film, some judicious editing allowed the excising of extraneous material after the death of Catherine, that allowed the focus of that film to remain pure and undiluted.  Unfortunately, the 1992 version is so faithful to the novel that the horrendous nature of Heathcliff's inner demons remain at the forefront at all times.  Unlike Bronte, director Kosminsky does not have the luxury to gradually permit a believable segue from one plot complication to another.  What he does show are confusing time shifts, lack of character development (especially with Hindley and Hareton), and a bottled-up sense of agida that has no place to go to but implode.  Juliet Binoche in a double role of Catherine and Cathy is irritatingly whiny and uncertain of her feelings and motivations.  The primary fault of the 1992 WUTHERING HEIGHTS is that it tries too hard to replicate totally in less than two hours what Emily Bronte more successfully accomplished in nearly three hundred pages.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had the pleasure of hearing Gavin Degraw open for Maroon5 a few months ago and was blown away! I had heard Degraw's single a few times before, but really knew nothing about him. His voice is amazing and his songs are both catchy and intelligent. I love Gavin's sound and would suggest this cd to everyone I know. I would also suggest everyone buy Maroon5's cd &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;!
B000003TA4|1.0|The music industry's in such a sorry state these days. Nevermind has frozen music for the past twelve years. The music industry is stagnant. It ain't going anywhere. That is THE sign that we need something fresh. Everything that comes out nowadays is hawked as &quot;alternative rock&quot; when it's as disgustingly popular and manufactured as Backstreet Boys pop. So-called &quot;alt. rock&quot; isn't alternative when it's the norm. Every kid on the block wishes they were lonely and alienated because that's how MTV tells them to feel. So what's the first step they do after listening to MTV's brainwashing? They go to Tower Records and buy Nirvana's Nevermind on CD for $20. Kurt didn't start a revolution, he started a mass pollution of purposely poorly-produced hate rock. <br />Here's some folksy rock &amp; country albums I recommend instead:<BR>Willie Nelson: The Demo Sessions<BR>Robert Clyne &amp; the Peacemakers: Honky Tonk Union<BR>Melissa Etheridge: Yes I am<BR>The Refreshments: The Bottle &amp; Horses
0385504209|3.0|Most of the reviews I've read have been complimentary about The Da Vinci Code, The critics liked the book and it has become a runaway best seller, so I know I'm in the minority, when I say I thought the book was a bit lame.<br />A book full of references to the Holy Grail, Opus Dei, the Knights Templar, the Priory of Sion, the Golden Ratio and symbology in famous art works should be interesting, and the Da Vinci Code was interesting. However I thought the main characters lacked depth, the wild assumptions and conclusions made by Langdon and Sophie continually stretched credibility and I thought the plot was predictable and started to run out of steam about half way through.<br />I regularly read in reviews that this book is 'well researched', however the constant reference to Sir Leigh Teabing as 'Sir Teabing' rather than the correct (as any commonwealth citizen knows) Sir Leigh, gave me the distinct impression that the research was quick and superficial, or at the very least, the book was in need of some rigorous editing.<br />It's a fast-paced easy read, but I could only give the Da Vinci Code three stars.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I absolutely love the Strokes. Which is one of the reasons I have yet to buy their new CD. In fact, I haven't even heard any song from it except for &quot;12:51.&quot; The reason is because there is no way the Strokes could possibly do better than &quot;Is This It.&quot; The new CD cannot come close to this. So, instead of being extremely dissapointed in a band I adore, I continue to listen to the debut album.<BR>The Strokes have taken more criticism than any rock band out there today. And, when you think about it, it's inevitable really. It had to happen. Any band that gets the reviews and hype such as those recieved by the Strokes will certainly be criticised just as much by people who think they are too cool to listen to music considered good by the general public. But don't blame the Strokes for their popularity. Sometimes the radio really does play good music, and people end up liking it. Imagine that.<BR>One of the things they take criticism on is their image. Forget their goddamn image. That has nothing to do with anything. So what if they're rich kids that try to look hardcore. This is about their music.<BR>And their music is damn good. Yes, I know, they're on MTV. While I will agree that MTV will be the downfall of western civilization, you can't judge a band just because they are popular. &quot;Is This It&quot; is full of the best hooks I've heard in a long time. Every song will get stuck in your head. The one bad song on the entire album is &quot;Last Nite.&quot; Besides that, every song is very well done.<BR>Now lets talk about originality. The Strokes have come under fire for sounding like other bands, particularly The Velvet Underground. Yes, they may sound like other bands, but every band has influences. It's inevitable that there will be similarties between bands. But you can't say that this is unoriginal. Sure, you can detect the inluences of Lou Reed on this album, but you can't say The Strokes copied him. I love Reed, and I don't think the Strokescould ever match his work, but Lou Reed never wrote songs that sounded like this. Saying that they copied The Velvet Underground is an unfair statement made by people who dislike the band just because that's the hip thing to do.<BR>Finally, returning once again to the music, there's Julian Casablanca's voice. He may not be the best singer in the world, but he delivers the lyrics in a way that is appropriate for the music going on behind him. His delivery, the music, and the lyrics themselves blend perfectly.<BR>For those willing to listen, I think you will enjoy this album. For those who care more about impressing their hipster friends, I pity you, because you are no better than those little preteen girls who listen to whatever Carson Daly tells them to.
1400034779|5.0|Botswana is the setting for the first in a series of detective novels by Alexander McCall Smith featuring Mma Precious Ramotswe, a 'traditionally built' women 'blessed with expansive girth rather than height'. When Mma Ramotswe's father dies from lung disease - the result of long years spent working in South African mines - she uses her inheritance to open her own business, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. <br />We follow a progression of cases including the man who had joined a Christian sect and then vanished, a wealthy Indian business man determined to reign in an errant daughter with 'modern ideas', a factory worker suspected of committing insurance fraud, and a boy who may have been kidnapped by a witch-doctor. These delightful vignettes introduce us to a wealth of beautifully detailed characters described with humour, compassion and an obvious love of Africa and its people. <br />The gentle pace of this book perfectly matches the wisdom and insight of Mma Ramotswe as she drives her tiny white van through the shimmering heat of Botswana.

But the only way to break the witch's curse on her is to help a blue fire demon gain his freedom from Howl. But that takes time, and Sophie's has to make sure that the Witch of the Waste doesn't find her first.<br />Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderful, humorous fantasy full of magic and romance. It will keep you guessing what the next page will bring, and all leads up to an explosive ending big enough for two worlds.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The picture is perfect.  The sound is excellent.  The extras great.  And the show is incredible.  I think the critics need to rethink if they've omitted this DVD set off their list.  I got it at Christmas and it was my first introduction to the show and was amazed.  Best present I got....even if I did give it to myself.
B000000HHE|5.0|How can some reviewers only put 4 stars to this hiphop tour de force. Let's make this clear : if &quot;3 feets&quot; doesn't get the 5 stars then i don't see which album is gonna get them as  This is one of the 3 best rap albums of all time and probably the coolest one. Tribe's 3 first albums are all great but i would still rate this one slightly better. 24 tracks, no flaws and something like 7 or 8 potential singles.&quot;the magic numbers&quot;, &quot;eye know&quot;,&quot;tread water&quot;,&quot;say no go&quot; and &quot;potholes in my lawn&quot; all sound effortlessly cool. &quot;3 feets&quot; maybe nearly 15 years old but it still is a breath of fresh air compare to productions of today's rap... It's also by far De La's best record. Go for it, if you like oldschool hiphop you can't go wrong here...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got to see exactly one episode on television.  But I wasn't in the mood and was busy working to really pay much attention.  I never took the time to watch again.  But for Christmas I got some credit and bought the DVD set on a whim.  WOW!  What a great cowboy space drama.  There are some great, true relationships on this show.  It's got something for everyone.  I can't believe so many crap shows endure on and on and on and this WONDERFUL show was cancelled.  I am sad I never got into the show when it was airing.  I doubt it would have stopped the cancelation but it would be nice to say that I was an original fan.  Thank God I'm onboard now.
0385504209|1.0|Newsweek recently described this novel as a \\"blockbuster thriller full of religious mumbo-jumbo and cracker barrel art history.\\" I couldn't agree more. I read this book at the recommendation of my grandmother, who considered it to be a brilliantly crafted work of literature backed by scholarly research. However, I discerned immediately that a novel of such popularity in the masses could not possibly be TOO literary. Our public in general does not like to think. And the book matched my expectations. Brown's prose is utterly graceless and pedestrian, dispelling any pretense of intellect or refinement. Brown does not even make a minor attmept to develop his characters. Langdon and Neveu are cardboard cutouts of \\"good guys,\\" the pathetic caricature of a British twit made me burn with embarrassment for the author, and the stupid albino giant is just plain laughable. The plot, while undeniably a page turner, is full of inconsistencies and at times is just absurd. The (plagiarized) theories that serve as the backbone of the novel are interesting for a moment but quickly lose credibility in Brown's attempt to relate them to everything in the world.  The Little Mermaid as the Sacred Feminine? Give me a break. Brown insists on whacking the reader over the head repeatedly with the same old revelation from a hundred pages ago. And the climax, in which he reveals the least suspicious character to be, in fact, the villain, is so sloppily contrived and cliche that I had to laugh. Dan Brown must truly believe  himself to be writing for an audience of imbeciles. And, given the acclaim and hype that has rushed in from the public, I would have to say that his assumption is correct.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is a great movie for everyone in your family. I own this movie and it is awesome! It's about a little fish, Nemo, who gets lost and has to find his way back home. His dad goes searching for him and they both have many adventures as they find their way back to each other. It's a great family film filled with laughter, adventure, and some mild suspense. I urge everyone from the age of 4 to 104 t buy this movie. The added features on this DVD are great fun, too!

0316666343|5.0|I was deeply moved by this book.  Suzie is murdered at fourteen by a neighborhood monster.  She goes to heaven and watches for years -- and describes in the first person -- how her bereaving family and friends cope with that fact.  That the ultimate denouement is a bit too Hollywoody (as some other reviewers have said) doesn't detract, in my opinion, from the grace and the insight about family relationships and about life's miracles with which the author imbues her story.  When Hollywood brings out the movie, it may turn out to be quintessentially tacky (but I still hope they do!).  But the writing is poignantly beautiful, magically inspired.  A definite must-read.

B00013F35I|3.0|This concert was a love fest between audience and performer(s), but I was disappointed in the DVD. Only after I printed out the lyrics (from the internet) was I able to understand what he was saying, even though I'd heard about half the songs before. Screaming and mumbling, often seemingly intoxicated, he gets by on charisma rather than getting a message across. It will be a long time, if ever, before I play this DVD again.
B0000028TN|5.0|Who were the pop, funk, jazz, or rock musicians playing IN BRAZIL with BRAZILIAN musicians in the late 1970's and early 1980's?  The list isn't that extensive, but you have to put George Duke up there on that list.  This album is outstanding from end to end.  The improvisation is super tight, the songwriting is excellent, the overall playing is impressive, and the spiritual vibe of this project is simply lovely.  A true &quot;labor of love&quot; that works spectacularly well over twenty-years later.<br />Bravo George!
B00008YLV2|3.0|Saw it recently for the second time, and it's a gritty, solid war film, with some intense action scenes, and little sappy melodrama. I won't go at length, so as not to repeat what's already been written here, but it does stand as one of the better American war films, up in the same general group as &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; although not on the same philosophical level. If there's maybe one criticism, it's that the Somalian people are presented as cardboard caricatures, almost like swarms of bugs, that just keep coming and coming, nothing more than throngs of unrelenting &quot;things.&quot; While, as others have pointed out, there are some heart-wrenching scenes made to humanize the Somalian people, those are few and far between. At times, the Somalian militia members come as almost cartoonish in their &quot;thuggishness.&quot; Even the orcs/Uruk-hai in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; received more characterization. The Somalians here are seen, not heard. Understandable that the focus is on the &quot;western&quot; side of this incident, and not essential in this movie to go to &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; lengths to present &quot;both sides,&quot; but nonetheless, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; could have used more dimension in capturing the Somalian people and the Somalian militia and show us their motivations. Perhaps if it were made for a more intelligent audience, it would have been better and the Somalians presented in a more, well-rounded fashion. But as it is, its intense fighting scenes are, sorry for the cliche, nailbiters, and they show how seemingly small errors can compound upon each other, and, mixed with western over-confidence and egotism, how seemingly good intentions can backfire.
B00008PW2D|2.0|The fifth season DVD collection is a lot like sex in the fifth year of marriage...You're only getting half what you used to for the same amount of money, and what you're getting is pretty uninspired.<br />The fifth season is an easily skipped set.  This collection is really only for the diehard fans that must have the entire series complete in their collections (which unfortunately includes me).  Don't waste your money otherwise.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I first heard this album long ago because my Dad (Pappy) was a huge Dylan fan. Probably the biggest Dylan fan in Delaware at the time, which is where we lived. Pappy said this was one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; by Dylan that you couldn't live without (the other two being &quot;Bringing it All Back Home&quot; and &quot;Blonde and Blonde&quot;). But this one was his favorite -- especially the immortal (his words) &quot;Desolation Row&quot; which contains the line: &quot;As lady and I, look out tonight, from Desolation Row.&quot; But who is lady? Try though we did, we could never quite figure that one out. Maybe that's why, whenever I hear the song, I always sing along with it but change the lyrics to &quot;As Pappy and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.&quot; And I invite you to sing along too!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|What happened here? I loved the first Matrix film. Great plot, great acting...spectacular film. Then came the sequel, and, well...Matrix Reloaded was quite a disappointment in comparison to the first film. The entire time I was watching the film I found nothing that really grabbed me as a viewer and made me think &quot;WOW!&quot; Actually, my response was more like an unenthralled &quot;whoa&quot;. Save a few well designed action and fx sequences, I couls barely keep interest in this movie. Perhaps three will be less of a frustrating disappointment than this sequel, but after this one...I'm almost afraid to even try the third. I give this film 2 stars.

B0000640SB|5.0|Pure Praise<br />I was surprised there were not more reviews about this movie. I suppose sarcasm is not everyone's cup of tea -- perhaps because sometimes it delivers a turd in the tea cup -- but this movie is explosive, fast paced, thoughtful, humorous, original, and even at times wise. Don't overlook it as Hollywood ooga booga it is a thoroughly grounded film. The plot is well constructed, the characters are thoroughly developed (there are even some genuinely emotional moments), the topic is zany yet plausible, and the scenery is fantastic. I love movies that make New York look like the city I know. See Spike Lee movies for this (he is, in my opinion, the best). Men in Black does a great job using the armory on Park Ave. and 25th street and the Meat Packing District, Downtown by the Hudson River, Flushing Meadows, the NJ Turnpike, the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel just to name a few key places. It's fun to sightsee while watching an 'alien' movie.<br />Beyond scenery, there is an overwhelming point to this movie also that sometimes gets overlooked. In one brilliant moment right after J (Will Smith) fires his weapon in public, K (Tommy Lee Jones) scolds his rookie partner to be more discreet by saying, &quot;There's always an Archillion battlecruiser or an intergalactic plague threatening to wipe out life on this sorry little planet but the things that keeps people going on with their happy little lives is that they do not know about it.&quot; Tell that to the Republicans using the potential for terror attacks as a campaign tool. There are always and always have been a multitude of threats to every life. That's the emotional starting point from which we can honestly relate to this movie and these two nameless agents. What makes them true heroes is they are not only working for us but they are working without getting any acclaim, well, accept for from this movie.<br />The next thing is chemistry. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great together. They play off each other well. The more you watch this movie the more you will laugh. Like all great things it gets better with time. There are little things like sudden changes in tone &amp; slight raggings, that bring out the humor potential of both actors. The most underrated actor is Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Edgar/the Bug. Between the make-up, the voice, and the bizarre movements he actually becomes a bug. It's unbelievable how believable it is. This is no easy feat.<br />The last thing worth praise, is the music. The music performed by Danny Elfman is sarcastic and inventive to go along perfectly with the other aspects of the movie. He takes the traditional John Williams Star Wars and Indiana Jones riffs of heroism and inverts them and dismantles them to produce some of his own top notch melodies.<br />I think sometimes movies that are funny lack the acclaim they deserve. Just because it is going to make you laugh doesn't mean it isn't saying something. Look at Chris Rock or Kurt Vonnegut for examples of humor meant to tell you something that you couldn't bare to hear if it was told to you straight. Men In Black reminds me of Jonathan Swift's &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; in that way. The movie works on many levels at once. In Swift's story he claims that the Irish should just eat their babies as to not have such a burdensome problem. Really he's attacking the society and the English. In Men in Black you have a very interesting view of society. That is, how much should we know? And how much to we want government to work in secret?<br />Final point, get this movie, you won't be disappointed.r well. The more you watch this movie the more you will laugh.

Look at Chris Rock or Kurt Vonnegut for examples of humor meant to tell you something that you couldn't bare to hear if it was told to you straight. Men In Black reminds me of Jonathan Swift's &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; in that way. The movie works on many levels at once. In Swift's story he claims that the Irish should just eat their babies as to not have such a burdensome problem. Really he's attacking the society and the English. In Men in Black you have a very interesting view of society. That is, how much should we know? And how much to we want government to work in secret? <br />Final point, get this movie, you won't be disappointed.
B00005ATQD|5.0|All you pathetic little \\"Cruise/Kidman\\" fans are the most dense, stupid, senseless, brain-damaged, brain-dead, ret@rded creatures ever. This is not Jerry Maguire. This is not Days of Thunder. This is NOT Moulin Rouge, you stupid rednecks! This is art. This is film. This is cinema. TRUE cinema. I bet all you ret@rds that hated this movie have 'You've Got Mail' and every single Freddie Prinze Jr. movie ever made sitting on your shelves. Oh, how you smile with masturbatory glee when you look upon your commercialized Hollywood junk. Just stay away from intelligent movies like Eyes Wide Shut. You brain-dead zombies obviously lack the brain-cells to even comprehend the message behind it. I know you're all disappointed cuz you were expecting a \\"sizzling, sexy sex-romp\\" of a movie. How inane are you people? You Hollywood brainwashed ret@rds.
B00005OAA6|5.0|This is really a Super CD.  Victoria has real talent and this really is a great CD!  I have always been a big fan of the Spice Girls and love them as a group and as solo artists am really happy to find out that they have individual talent and the ability to make really great music.  Bravo Victoria!  I look forward to your next CD!!!
0451160916|5.0|I read The Shining last year after being sick of hearing how great it was. (Hey! It's just a book!) The last straw was when I saw a Friends episode in which Rachel finds a copy of The Shining in Joey's freezer because he was reading it and got scared. And he says that The Shining is the best book there is. Well I bought it and read it. I found out it really is THAT great! It'll have you looking over your shoulder for a while. Only Stephen King can make you scared of a stupid bathtub. *****
B00009V7RF|5.0|i was pleasantly surprised. this is a really great CD with a ton of variety. many songs are very catchy w/ a good dance beat. each is unique. definately worth buying!!

B00008ADPF|1.0|Once upon a time I was walking down the road and a squirrel of wisdom came up to me, he bade me to kneel down and put my ear to his lips so he could whisper a secret, which I did. Now you would normally think that a magic squirrel would have something unique and astounding to say like how the universe works or something...but you know what he said? LONG ROAD BY NICKELBACK IS THE MOST AWFUL, HORRIBLE PILE OF STEAMING ZEBRA POOH HE HAS EVER HAD THE DISPLEASURE TO LISTEN TO!!!!!!!!, boy and I thought it was just bad!!!!!!!!!
630521610X|5.0|Note that most of the people who called it stupid said they stoped the movie only a few minutes into it.<BR>Hello?! This is an INTELEGENT horror/thriller/suspense movie if I ever saw one!  It plays with your mind, it makes fun of other horror films, and at times it even makes fun of itself.  Having the sense of humor that I do, I find that entertaining.<BR>My one complaint, and this goes for the entire series even, is that there were time during my first veiwing of the films that I was plugging my ears and half closing my eyes, expecting the killer to suddenly jump out of nowhere-yet this never really happens, or at least not often enough to be considered a movie that makes you &quot;Jump out of your seat&quot;, except maybe with laughter.  It did keep me on the edge of my seat, though.  But repeated viewings will probably not do that, since I now know there's really no big &quot;scares&quot;.  However, I now own the trillogy because I find it to be very clever, and it does have all the other horror elements aside from pure sudden scares.<BR>To the guys who think it's stupid, try seeing it ALL THE WAY THROUGH!! They're only making you THINK it's a typical movie for the first few minutes. lol

B00008WG3U|5.0|Nearly 20 years after they formed, NOFX has still got that punk rebellion deep inside their hearts.  &quot;The War on Erroism&quot; is a great attack on the current US government.  The CD booklet even states, &quot;Somewhere in Texas, there is a vilage without its idiot&quot;.  A caricature of George W. Bush as a clown is on the cover.  The cd is filled with catchy punk riffs and great lyrics.  My favorite songs are &quot;The Seperation of Church and Skate&quot;, &quot;The Idiots are Taking Over&quot;, &quot;She's Nubs&quot;, &quot;Mattersville&quot;, &quot;We Got Two Jealous Again&quot;, &quot;13 Stitches&quot;, &quot;Regaining Unconsciousness&quot;, and &quot;Whoops, I OD'd&quot;.  All the songs are great though.  I recomend this for any punk or NOFX fans.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Putting aside the fact that Britney has no talent, the album is okay. The one song that really sticks out is No. 7, Outrageous.  Me Against the Music with Madonna is kind of pointless. You barely hear madonna singing at all, and the song isnt really that great.  One good thing about the album, though is its got some good beats, for dancing and whatnot.  Even though she has a pretty face, Britney just plain out has no talent whatsoever.
0393057658|4.0|Moneyball is a worthwhile read. I found the first half of the book to be very interesting (sabermetrics, Bill James, etc.) However, I found the second half of the book to be insulting- esprcially the way manager Art Howe was portrayed. Michael Lewis made this man with 30 years of baseball experience out to be a puppet and yes-man. I wondered if the book was proof read and edited by Billy Beane himself.<BR>I think Tim Hudson's name is mentioned once while Mark Mulder and Barry Zito never were. If not for these three starting pitchers, the A's would have acheived little success and the book would have no basis for being written. Credit the A's winning directly to these three arms moreso than sabermetrics.<BR>Intersting book but don't believe evrything you read.
B000002L9M|5.0|Black Celebration represents many things for Depeche Mode.  Sonically, we're looking at an evolution of their synthesized, sampled, semi-industrial pop sound -- a little less tinny than Some Great Reward.  Lyrically and thematically, what we have is a full realization of the bleakness DM had been flirting with on songs like \\"Blasphemous Rumours,\\" \\"Love, in Itself,\\" and \\"Shake the Disease.\\"  This is important because it is the final, complete break with the cheerier sound associated with early Depeche Mode albums, and a transformation into the greatest band to emerge from the 1980s.<br />The title track sets the tone for the album very effectively, using a thick layer of menacing bass under twinkling melodic keynotes.  \\"Black Celebration\\" is not quite as dark as most of the other songs on this album; but maybe it's really just that it is a declaration of the need to hang onto whatever happiness we can in the face of all-encompassing misery.  A perfect opening to a near-perfect album.<br />The eerie underlying synth of the first track evolves into the backdrop for the second: \\"Fly on the Windscreen.\\"  This is DM at their gloomiest; a pummeling bass underpins the need for human contact as a reminder that there is such a thing as life.<br />\\"A Question of Lust\\" begins a hat trick of delicate songs sung by Martin Gore.  It's an earnest, airy tale of the needless suspicion of jealousy in a relationship that probably won't last.  A shimmering, sad ballad in an album of despair, yet a nice bounce-back from \\"Windscreen.\\"<br />\\"Sometimes,\\" the next song, is I believe very underrated -- I've seen someone deride it as an ersatz \\"Somebody,\\" which is really not at all accurate.  It employs only Martin's voice, echoed in a strange fashion, over a lazy, very pretty piano piece.  A short and sad little number that fits the album without question.<br />The next track is \\"It Doesn't Matter Two\\" (to be distinguished from \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" on SGW).  I like this song for its use of a choral sample, manipulated almost beyond recognition, as its main rhythm.  Martin sings of lost sexual innocence here, his voice lending a requisite fragility that Dave Gahan's would not.<br />Dave resumes a lead singing role on \\"A Question of Time,\\" with a fast synth beat picking up the pace.  I did not like this song much at first, but in the concert version, Martin whacks a guitar to replace the kazoo-like effect of the synth found here - a definite improvement.<br />\\"Stripped\\" is the centerpiece of BC.  Fragile synth keynotes convey a shared, secret sensuality, while a constant backing hum coats everything in sweaty pheromones.  The muffled rhythm of a train drives the song from start to finish.  Altogether an addictively beautiful song about the search for intimacy in a bleak, black, filthy, distant world.<br />From the escapism without in \\"Stripped,\\" we turn to escapism within in \\"Here is the House.\\"  Acoustic guitar is used well here against a barely danceable beat, creating one of the more obscure, underappreciated DM songs.<br />Martin's last lead singing role is \\"World Full of Nothing,\\" an account of loveless sex as told from an omniscient, third-party perspective.  Haunting, especially with the repeated \\"Though it's not love, it means something.\\"<br />\\"Dressed in Black\\" is the weakest song on BC.  It seems to redeem every tidy cliche about mods that has ever been thrown at them, and consequently feels trite.  It should have traded places with one of the B-sides, \\"Christmas Island.\\"<br />What follows is the pounding, trenchant bass of \\"New Dress,\\" a political statement about the stupid things society values as important.  A very cool song as relevant today as it was in 1986.<br />Black Celebration closes with \\"But Not Tonight\\" - as upbeat as any song gets on this album, though it does not feel out of place.  It is carried by a fast beat and just a hint of optimism in the darkness.  A fitting final chapter in DM's darkest tome.<br />If you like 80s music atall, buy this album.  If you like 80s music and were raised on Moby, NIN, or Orbital, DEFINITELY buy this album.  You will be glad you did.usic at all, buy this album.  If you like 80s music and were raised on Moby, NIN, or Orbital, DEFINITELY buy this album.  You will be glad you did.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly never aired where I live. But the internet helped me to keep up with the works of Joss Whedon. I downloaded and saw each and every episode of FireFly only a couple of days after they aired. And boy was it good! You could realy tell this was a dream come true for Joss... &quot;There's no place I can be, since I found Serenity&quot;. I think this is what Joss was feeling. I also think that's why he has got to make a movie. Let's hope they let him. Let's hope it succeeds and does well. Let's hope they'll make a television show of this movie ;)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|After all these years of not really liking this &quot;album&quot;, I can honestly say after listening to it tonight that I could really feel what was happening to The Beatles as they put this together - the overall sadness of knowing they were at an end and knowing there was nothing they could do to &quot;get back to where they once belonged&quot; (sorry, paraphrasing a little there).  You can feel the anger, the senses of betrayal, the bitterness, and the love/hate they all felt for one another.  Phil Spector totally overproduced this album, making a mess out of what it should have been and now is - a simply beautiful, powerful swan song for, arguably, the best musical group ever.  You probably won't ever regret buying this CD if, like me, you grew up with these guys and loved them from Day One.
B000002IOW|5.0|I really like this CD.  There are so many little memorable melodies spread throughout that just stick in your head.  Sure, it doesn't knock you over like a locomotive, but the performance here is much more subtle and nuanced.  You won't pick these nuances up on your first listen.  But they're there in the form of really cool chord changes or fragments of melody that catch your ear.  Plus, the playing is uniformly strong.  Honestly, I think this CD features some of the band's best songs in terms of composition, tension/release dynamics, and sheer beauty.  For proof, see &quot;The Pass,&quot; &quot;Presto,&quot; &quot;Available Light,&quot; etc.
B00000331V|5.0|hearing this now is just like when i was there for this show at the garden you can still feel the balcony bounce and see it bounce. see the lights flash when wolf says&quot;we are gona blow your face out&quot;and slide right on into house party if you were not there you will feel like you are there. so repuda da buda let down your hair and let me climb up to the lite of your love.
B00008LDPU|5.0|In my collection...I have several anime' films even though I am not a fan of the genre..this by far is the best...and one of the best movies I've seen..if you are a fan of the Matrix you would be missing out by overlooking this film..Animatrix can certainly hold it's own against any other film extant including the &quot;live action&quot; Matrix movies
B00005U2JL|5.0|Footages from different places around the world, from Japan to Russia, and not only in the US...pretty cool.  No reason to not own one for Marilyn Manson fans...and even those who aren't fans, perhaps you may see how Marilyn Manson is admired worldwide by people from even the most different cultures.  Awesome music, live shows....just recommended!
B00008PW2D|4.0|I have read other reviews on here and reluctantly bought this DVD because all \\"Sex and the City\\" fans, pretty much, seem to agree that this season was big fat mess at worst or a waste of time at best.  Although I don't appreciate HBO jacking up the price either, I found this season great.  No there weren't grand dramatic story arcs like usual, but this needed to happen to these characters.  ANd two of the lead actresses were pregnant!!For once, they aren't really dealing with the current guy in their life and focusing on other things.  I have been keeping pace with this show with the DVD releases, so god knows when season 6 will be out, but beyond the extravagant price and annoying lag time between seasons on DVD, I recommend this season wholeheartedly for any true fan.
B00006IUL6|3.0|Its great to see this movie filmed around here in B.C...the film is entertaining..but CANNOT be compared to the original Norwegian version of this thriller.  The location that took place &amp; shot in the Norwegian version, was a real town north of the Arctic Circle, where one can truly experience the 24-hour daylight...where as the American version was shot not too far from the mainland US border!  The US version of the movie took place supposedly in a small town in Alaska... Yet, one cannot really see the midnight sun or experience the true 24-hour daylight north or around the Arctic Circle..yet the movie took place around densely forested regions with towering granite peaks...doesn't sound too much like Northern Alaska to me.  The first second I looked at it reminded me more of B.C.'s natural surroundings or perhaps maybe some place in southern Alaska (which is far from the Arctic Circle) rather than the north.  Definately not as realistic.  And as I recall the name of the town they used in the movie...does exist in real life in AK, but was either abandoned or too tiny of a settlement that looked nothing like the one in the movie.  The town that was shot in the movie, is in real life a fair-sized town close to Vancouver... Sorry that this unimportant information may sound boring to most of you, but for a resident here, and living so close to where the movie was shot, it was just too hard for me to &quot;fall into it&quot; or &quot;believe in it&quot;.  Anyhow, without getting too picky regarding where it was shot, etc...of course, its just a movie!  Its suspensful enough with a different ending (just like any other Hollywood film), but it can't beat the original.  Go for the Norwegian version instead...the less &quot;Hollywood-obvious&quot; version.
0385504209|4.0|I just finished this book last night.  It's extremely captivating and well researched.  It does have anti-Christian overtones however, which aren't well disguised.
0156421178|5.0|If you want to learn about: the spanish civil war, anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, fascist spain, stalinism/communist party, or Orwell's politics, this book is for you.  Orwell, who was a reporter who decided to fight in Spain alongside the anarchists and socialists and communists, gives a realistic, unbiased account of the spanish civil war.  Not only does he provide the reader with knowledge about how the war was fought, but he describes the anarchist held region of catalonia, where, in my opinion, true socialism was achieved.  This book is often referred to by socialists and anarchists for its vivid desrciption of socialism in action.  I suggest you read it.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Well, sort of. Drawing on the influences of Brian May, Uli Roth<BR>and Ritchie Blackmore (among others), Yngwie basically invents Neo-classical shred with this album. While we have seen many great guitarists rise up since this was released in 1984, one gets the feeling that this album has never really been topped- even by Yngwie himself. Possibly the only guitarist to push the boundaries past this point is Uli Jon Roth with his new \\"Metamorphosis\\" album, which is a must for any fan of shred.
0385504209|1.0|This book, which &quot;everybody&quot; is reading, is truly fiction and not good fiction at that.  The author unites fact with semi-fact with fiction to give gullible people a sense that what he writes is all true.  Wrong.  I mean, really:  &quot;Amon-Isis&quot; = &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;?  Please.  The omelette begins with what, for some reason, &quot;everybody&quot; thinks is sinister:  the Pope, the Vatican and Opus Dei.  (Yes, OD really exists but is mostly made up of toothless old men less functional that the Knights of Columbus.)  Read Perez-Reverte (&quot;Seville Communion&quot;) or countless other fictional treatments of the Vatican &quot;secret police&quot; for better entertainment.  Add the myth that keeps coming back, the Holy Grail, and stir in another secret society (that which protects the Grail = descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene) and you have what seems to be a plausible story.  It ain't, folks:  it's fiction.  Read it that way and enjoy it that way.  But DVC is no more authoritative than &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; no matter how much you want to believe it.
1573300403|5.0|Michael Jackson does it again with HIStory on Film: Volume II. This DVD features 14 short films (3 featured on Michael's other DVD) on a two-sided DVD designed to blow you away! Michael Jackson's ability to excite the millions who listen to his music and watch his short films is just magical and mystical, but cool nonetheless.<br />This is the lineup on this DVD:<br />SIDE ONE:<br />1. Program Start - nothing really, just the title screen pretty much.<br />2. Teaser - The promotional video used for the HIStory album features the unveiling of a gigantic statue of Michael Jackson. very cool to watch, and sets you up for the rest of the video.<br />3. Billie Jean (Motown 25 Performance)- The 1983 performance of Michael's hit &quot;Billie Jean&quot; where Michael debuted the most awe-inspiring dance move in history, the Moonwalk. This concert received an Emmy nomination and is the landmark for Michael's ability to perform in front of many. A good performance overall.<br />4. Beat It - Featured on the first HIStory DVD, titled &quot;Video Greatest Hits: HIStory&quot;, this video contains outstanding choreography and excellent dance moves by Michael. A good video for any Michael Jackson fan.<br />5. Liberian Girl - A very rare music video featuring many A-list actors like John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Corey Feldman (huge MJ fan), Dan Akroyd and Steve Guttenberg, as well as musical icons like &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Paula Abdul, and producer Quincy Jones. A great video, a must see.<br />6. Smooth Criminal - The full version taken from the 1988 movie &quot;Moonwalker&quot; features very complex choreography and good music and plot. A very good short film to watch.<br />7. 1995 MTV Video Music Awards Performance -  Michael Jackson performed a 15-minute medley of past and present hits including &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;. This outstanding performance literally stole the show and is forever known as one of the greatest Michael Jackson performances to this date.<br />8. Thriller - Also taken from the first Michael Jackson DVD, this is the masterpiece that made Michael Jackson a household name. Choreography and a plot &quot;to die for&quot; make this a must-see for all people, MJ fans or not.<br />SIDE TWO:<br />1. Scream (Duet With Janet Jackson) - Michael released this music video in 1995. The video features cool dance moves, dazzling special effects and other sweet tidbits, making it one of the most popular (and the most expensive) music video ever made!<br />2. Childhood (Theme from Free Willy 2) - Michael Jackson really touches the heart with this video. Although it seems childish at times (children riding in flying boats, that kind of stuff), this is a side of Michael Jackson that people tend to ignore. A good video and song indeed.<br />3. You Are Not Alone - Michael's most sensitive video in my opinion. Not only does it prove that Michael can be sensitive and calm in his music videos, it also proves that Michael is not afraid to go shirtless (lol). A touching and sensitive video, a must-see.<br />4. Earth Song - One word: MASTERPIECE. No other word can sum up the single most influential, most magnificent, most sensitive video Michael Jackson has ever made. An outstanding song with a more outstanding video. The title seems corny, but a corny video this ain't! See for yourself!<br />5. They Don't Care About Us - Two versions of this video were made. This is the version that takes place in Brazil. This video proves that Michael can do it all. Great moves accompanied by a great beat emphasized by drummers featured in the video. A great video to watch and enjoy.<br />6. Stranger In Moscow - A simple yet solemn video featuring Michael walking down a street in Moscow. The video is purposely in slow motion, so no, it is not a problem with your DVD player. This video is sort of dark, maybe it's the weather in it, but it is a good video that can touch a person's heart.<br />7. Blood On The Dance Floor (Refugee Camp Remix) - By far the worst video on the DVD. I saw the original video, and it was great. Why didn't they use that? oh well. The video's okay, but the song I guess does not fit it. It's just not Michael Jackson I guess.<br />8. Brace Yourself (A Kaleidoscope of Michael Jackson HIStory) - Featured on the first Michael Jackson DVD, this is not a short film, but rather a look into the career of Michael Jackson and the impact he has had on the music industry as well as the world. This puts out the simple message: Brace Yourself.
B000002KIE|5.0|It may sound strange, but I'm only 13 years old and my favorite band is \\"the Sex Pistols!\\"  I had first heard about the band when I was at a party somewhere, and I overheard my Mom talking about them to someone.  At first I thought they were just another stupid classic rock band with a funny name, but I absolutely cannot believe that I dismissed them as that.  Then I purchased \\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4\\" a few years later, which includes \\"Anarchy In the U.K.\\" on it's soundtrack.  When I was scanning the video game's music play list, I paused for a moment at the sight of \\"the Sex Pistols,\\" and, remembering it's highly recognizable name, I remember asking myself, \\"Why would a dumb old classic rock band be on THPS4?\\"  So I played the song, and I tried to not look too blown away by it in front of my brother.  I couldn't believe that it was a wicked awesome punk rock ballad, and not a retarded folk rock song!  Throughout the next year, I became more and more interested in \\"the Sex Pistols,\\" until finally, this December, I received \\"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\\" for Christmas.  The album is extremely well created, highly influential, and very violent.  I listened to the whole album and absolutely loved it, even though I had only heard 2 songs from it.  What even makes the \\"angry\\" music better is Johnny Rotten's sneering vocals of anarchy, hatred, and abortions.  \\"The Sex Pistols\\" are officially the inventors of hardcore punk rock, mostly because of the fact that they have influenced so many hardcore bands around the U.S., even though they only had 1 studio album.  These bands include \\"Black Flag,\\" \\"The Dead Kennedys,\\" \\"The Misfits,\\" and \\"Bad Religion.\\"  Yes, I know, \\"the Ramones\\" released their first album before \\"the Sex Pistols,\\" but \\"the Sex Pistols'\\" music was more chaotic and nihlistic than \\"the Ramones',\\" (no offense to them, they rock!) and that's the way punk rock is supposed to be.  So, even if you're just a little bit interested in the art of punk rock, I highly recommend this album, because your favorite punk rock band of today, may have been influenced by \\"the Sex Pistols...\\"
B0000CDLA7|2.0|The guys brag on the &quot;making of Train of Thought&quot; video that comes with the CD, that it only took 2 weeks to record the album &quot;but don't tell the fans!&quot;<br />Well you don't have to tell the fans.  It shows in one of their worst albums in years.<br />I guess I've really been spoiled by Awake, Metropolis 2, and S.D.I.T.  I suppose they can't all be great albums.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's a shame that Dirty was the first single to be released because it's far from the best song on the disc, and when i heard the song i was ready to write her off as a pop artist that was going in the wrong direction and it made me not want to even hear the rest of the cd. I mistaken judged the whole cd based on the song Dirty and thought that if the rest of the cd was like that, then it wasn't worth my time. Fortunately the rest of the singles released changed my attitude and made me listen. I think Christina is extremely talented, and we all know that she is a much better singer than Britney Spears can ever hope to be.  Christina's voice can be powerful or very subtle and gentle. Britney's vocal range is far too limited and is often helped out by the extensive use of background singers and digital enhancements. I find that in many of Britney's songs, the backup singers are the stars. With Christina there is no need for backup singers, as she can carry the whole tune herself.  The songs Beautiful, Fighter,  and especially The Voice Within are what sold me on the fact that Christina has an amazing talent beyond just being a disposable pop singer.  Her voice is unmistakeable and one-of-a-kind. The Voice Within and Beautiful are very well-written and very moving songs that helped change my original view of the cd. And Fighter is a very personal song. I wasn't that impressed with her first cd to be honest with you. Other than Genie In A Bottle, i didn't find much else that really made me sit up and take notice. Too many of the songs on that cd were too bland and just not memorable enough for me. I'm glad at the new direction Christina has taken with the new cd. It's obvious this is the music she REALLY wanted to do, as she wrote most of the songs on the new cd. Many of the songs are very personal and painful.  The song The Voice Within meant alot to me, as i heard it during a difficult time in my life. Even though i'm a guy, and the song is written for a girl, i changed the pronouns and gender of the song and it fit me perfectly and helped me a lot. The fact that a song can do that and affect someone only prooves how great the power of music is , and if a song or cd can change or help a person's life then that is the measure of a truely great cd. I recommend this cd. It has many different styles on it. Personally i feel Christina's voice shines best when she'd doing ballads more than dance music. Dirty is by far NOT the best cut on the cd.  The video was done so over-the-top on purpose. It's not for everyone, it shocked everyone the first time they saw it,  and definitely is not for young kids to see. I like the video because i &quot;get&quot; the concept. She wanted to get noticed and she wanted to move away from the pre-packaged, carefully crafted image of her first cd. So she deliberately threw in as many shocking things as she could in the video. It's too bad that too many people will judge her based on that song and video. I mistakenly did that, but i gave the other songs a chance and i was able to see past the Dirty song and video and to see she has talent. She'll be here for a long time, it's easy to tell. Britney, on the other hand is losing fans fast, especially with the new cd In The Zone and her choice of songs and musical/image direction. That cd in itself deserves a seperate review. I've yet to do a review for it, but from what i've heard and seen so far of the new Britney, i'm not impressed. Stick with Christina and you'll get a better quality cd.

B000002UAU|5.0|It was 20 years ago... not when Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play, but when I became a serious Beatles fan, having listened to their &quot;Blue&quot; &quot;1967-1970&quot; compilation album and hearing songs that would change my life forever. Amongst those songs were a selection of tracks from the album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. A couple of years later, upon hearing the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; album in it's entirity for the first time, it instantly became my favorite album and made me look at the way albums are produced in a whole new light. Yes, you've probably heard hundreds of times about the groundbreaking songwriting, music and artistry of this album; how it perfectly captured the free-thinking spirit of the psychedelic times it was recorded in, and how the barriers of western culture were moved as a result of all this, but the fact of the matter is this is all true and that is why this incredible album continues to win album poll after album poll almost 40 years on.<br />Nowadays, albums are the main products delivered by bands who then often take to touring to promote their album. The release of a single or two from an album usually serves only for further promotion, but before &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; singles were the big selling point for a band and albums were usually made just to capatalize on the popularity of those singles. The Beatles' first album in England, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was recorded in just one day for this very reason, which gives you some idea of how flippantly albums were regarded back then. But then &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; changed all of that. Suddenly an album was something to be taken seriously. It could be a labor of love and something for people to look upon as a whole piece of art and not just a collection of songs.<br />Paul's enthusiasm is evident throughout (after all, he was the one coming up with most of the ideas at the time, including the one for the concept of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; itself) and John's voice never sounded more beautiful and dreamy. Ringo's drumming on songs like &quot;Good Morning Good Morning&quot; is solid and dependable whilst imaginative on &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;. Overall, the quality of the music on this album is staggering. Listen to some of the Beatles earliest recordings and then listen to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. It's difficult to imagine that this is the same band, let alone the fact only 4 years have elapsed between the recording of their first songs and the recording of this album. It may be a snapshot of it's time but at the same time it sounds as fresh and relevant today as it did back then. We may analyze this album over and over for another 40 years, and probably will, but something that will never change is the significance of this album and the course it lay ahead for the music that followed and the tremors in rock history that are still felt from it today.f) and John's voice never sounded more beautiful and dreamy.

B00004Z459|5.0|The last two people who wrote a review for this album apparently have no taste for good music.  Linkin Park is easily one of the best bands out there!  They have totally original, memorable songs that you can listen to over and over again and with a mixture of rap and rock how can you go wrong?  This album is one of the best albums of all time and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  This album is not a kids album, and unlike rage against the machine you can actually understand what they are saying. Buy this album...now!!
B00005JM0B|5.0|TERMINATOR 3 RISE OF THE MACHINES WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER I'M A HUGE FAN OF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER HIS MOVIES ARE AWESOME LIKE TWINS LAST ACTION HERO TERMINATOR 1 TERMINATOR 2 JUDGEMENT DAY KINDERGARDEN COP JUNIOR AND LAST ACTION HERO
0790740443|4.0|Boy, I'm sure glad I watched this movie _before_ I found out I wasn't supposed to like it. I don't understand the disappointment; this is a well-made and satisfying movie.<br />I've said before that Kurt Russell is an extremely underrated actor, and he proves it again here. This is a demanding role.<br />Sgt. Todd is a genetically-engineered supersoldier, indoctrinated from birth as part of something called the 'Adam Project'. A seasoned combat veteran, Todd is a highly trained killing machine who has never known any other way of life.<br />Yet during the movie, we're supposed to gather that he's starting to feel some 'normal' human emotions and having trouble reconciling his past with his present. Somehow Todd has to put all this across to the audience with a bare minimum of dialogue and an absolutely flat-affect delivery -- rather like Arnold in the _Terminator_ films, with the difference that Todd is _not_ a cyborg or robot, but a human being with a deep inner life that he doesn't know how to express.<br />I don't know who could have played the part other than Russell. I can't think of another actor who could manage to convey so much with an expressionless face and _also_ be believable as a pumped-up supersoldier. (And Russell is seriously pumped up for this film.)<br />The story is well-crafted, too. Written by David Webb Peoples, one of the screenwriters on _Blade Runner_, this film is conceived as something of a sequel to that one and partakes of its darkness and moral ambiguity. But for all that, it zips along nicely under Paul Anderson's direction (despite some overuse of slo-mo).<br />Oh, there's some derivative stuff that we can charitably regard as 'homage' if we like. There's a very heavy nod toward _First Blood_ (and in general a strong evocation of the U.S.'s treatment of Vietnam veterans). And certainly this supersoldier thing has been done before (although _Universal Soldier_, _RoboCop_, and _The Six Million Dollar Man_ were cyborgs rather than genetically engineered Uebermenschen). That just means we're dealing with a very good B movie rather than something breathtakingly new.<br />Some viewers have suggested that Jason Scott Lee isn't very effectively used in this film. I disagree; I think he's downright fearsome in his single-minded lethality. (As you'll learn in the first few minutes of the film, he's one of a team of _super_-supersoldiers that are supposed to render Sgt. Todd and his guys obsolete.)<br />The SF backdrop is interesting and unforced although not terribly well fleshed out. All I can say without spoiling things is that there's a planet in the Arcadia sector that Earth is using as a junkyard, and that there's a human society living on it that nobody on Earth knows about.<br />The rest of the cast does well (including Michael Chiklis). Watch especially for a nice job by Gary Busey. You'll probably also like the Joel McNeely score, which doesn't break any new ground (and certainly doesn't hoist the film to the stratosphere as David Arnold's does _Stargate_) but nevertheless does its job adequately.<br />Oh -- and don't forget to be awed by the hauntingly gorgeous piece of music in Scene 11. It's 'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' by Loreena McKennitt and it's on her CD _The Book of Secrets_.ically engineered Uebermenschen).

B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah has done it again!!!! Brilliant Lyrics accompanied with catchy tunes make this album a must have! Highly reccomended tracks are fallen, world on fire, stupid and Train wreck. This cd is great to put on at anytime. It has high energy tunes but at the same time relaxing lyrics that make you feel great. You can put it on at a party or just before you go to bed. It is truly evident that she has poured herself entirely into Afterglow. With this album Sarah has made me a fan for life!!!! Congratulations to Sarah for making yet another hit album!!!!
B0000648WZ|5.0|So says Paul Verhoeven, who has said (and says again in the commentary on this DVD release) that it's one of the statements made by this morally complex film.<br /><br />I love listening to Verhoeven's commentaries (especially the one he does with Arnold Schwarzenegger on _Total Recall_). Here he shares the task with screenwriter Ed Neumeier, and putting the two of them together was an excellent choice. The commentary is one of the best features of the special edition.<br /><br />The film itself is hard to evaluate. Because it's Verhoeven, it's got sex, gore, and social satire. What it's also got -- and something that was arguably missing from the Robert A. Heinlein novel on which the film is based -- is a high level of moral complexity that doesn't divide everyone neatly into Good Guys and Bad Guys.<br /><br />The effect is odd, and oddly disturbing. On one hand, the film succeeds quite well as a combat shoot-'em-up in the style of the great World War II films. At that level, if we like, we can take the 'bugs' of Klendathu, playing as they do into our 'natural' loathing of insects, as a politically correct version of the sort of enemy Heinlein probably intended. (As long as we don't take the film's incompetent 'military action' too seriously.)<br /><br />On the other hand, the film also contains lots of sly references to the Third Reich, lots of little clues that suggest the 'bugs' didn't start the war, and lots of opportunities for the characters _and_ the audience to conclude that war may not be the best way to approach the problem here at issue.<br /><br />Okay, this latter stuff is a huge departure from Heinlein's novel, which was primarily focused on what makes military folks tick and what it means to be a responsible citizen. Heinlein's civics lesson is duly incorporated into the film, of course: a 'citizen' is one who takes personal responsibility for the safety and well-being of the body politic. But the film doesn't stop there.<br /><br />In fact, it incorporates elements that could have come from two other SF novels that have been read as responses to _Starship Troopers_, namely, Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ and Orson Scott Card's _Ender's Game_. I don't _know_ that Neumeier had either of these novels in mind, but there's an important reference to Mormons in the screenplay that in this context might suggest Card. Be that as it may, Heinlein's civics lesson is here subjected to severe scrutiny and even dark satire.<br /><br />That's okay by me. I regard _Starship Troopers_ as one of RAH's better novels (and as a success in its exploration of the military-man-coming-of-age mindset; I can see why military readers like it so well). Nevertheless there are problems with it that a straightforward screen adaptation wouldn't have been able to address. Neumeier and Verhoeven address those problems precisely by exaggerating them and sometimes openly ridiculing them -- while still managing to remain sensitive to the integrity of the military outlook.<br /><br />Such nuance may unfortunately be lost on much of the film's audience. Heinlein fans may either disapprove of Verhoeven's approach or miss it altogether; viewers who haven't read their Heinlein may not even be aware that there's an argument going on (and mistake this gorefest for nothing more than an earlier version of _Independence Day_).<br /><br />That's too bad, because this well-scripted, special-effects-laden film is a cinematic triumph on several levels -- only one of which is the gut-wrenching battle between humans and bugs. Verhoeven has long been clear that this film is _not_ an endorsement of either war itself or the fascistic society it tends to promote; that this isn't just obvious is a testament to Verhoeven's subtlety and, indeed, his _refusal_ to engage in 'propaganda' of the sort he satirizes.<br /><br />It's an odd film in the sense that, in order to like it properly, you have to dislike it. If you enjoy it too much, you're missing the point its director wanted it to make.
0780626494|5.0|Feel Good Movie....made my day a heck of a lot better!!!!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|1) An intriguing sense of futility.  Yeah, &quot;Firefly&quot; takes the concept of science fiction as a western (&quot;Star Trek&quot; was sold to NBC as &quot;Wagon Train to the stars&quot;) and treats it literally. But what struck me more was the sense of loss, from Simon and River's home to Captain Reynolds' ideals.  American science fiction tends to accentuate the positive, and this darkness made the characters that much more interesting.  In addition, the show made it clear the Alliance, an evil empire that Reynolds fought in a civil war, was there to stay. No one -- not Reynolds, not anyone -- was going to overthrow it.  In that sense, &quot;Firefly&quot; reminded me of &quot;Blake's 7,&quot; a late 70/early 80s British science fiction show where the heroes fought a huge government and won a few victories but never came close to upsetting the underlying order.  Captain Reynolds' motto isn't &quot;Use the Force&quot; or &quot;Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before,&quot; but &quot;Keep Flying,&quot; which is as close to resignation and defeat as you'll get.  But it feels a lot more realistic than other sci-fi aphorisms.<br />2) Great ensemble acting.  The cast was largely full of unkowns (save for &quot;Barney Miller's&quot; Ron Glass) who jelled quickly and shaded their characters effectively.  In particular, the mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin) gets the funniest lines but is probably the darkest person on the ship, one who would -- and nearly does -- sell out the crew if the money is good enough.  It's likely other characters would have blossomed, too, given enough time.<br />3) The story.  &quot;Buffy&quot; fans know Whedon's ability to tell a great yarn (I actually saw all of &quot;Firefly&quot; before a single &quot;Buffy&quot; episode), and there were some brilliant ongoing tales in the show.  The plot on River, a super-intelligent teenager who had been cruelly experimented on, is probably the best, and gradually unrolls over the 13-episode run, showing not only the impact of what had been done to her but the love between her and her brother Simon.  There are some great stand alone stories, too, especially &quot;Jaynestown,&quot; a moving meditation on faith and heroism.  The show wrapped up without leaving too many hanging threads, but the ones that remained (including the relationship between Reynolds and the prostitute Inara) were enough to make you wish the show had continued.<br />4) The likelihood of a &quot;Firefly&quot; movie will increase exponentially if you buy this DVD (the studio is keeping an eye on sales of this set).  Do your part for great art.

THA SAME GUY WHO WROTE MUSIC FOR GLADIATOR HELPED WIT PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, SOO HA!!
1582432678|2.0|It takes me a while, sometimes, to realize why a book bugs me. I'll already be twenty or thirty pages in, and then it hits me: I don't like the characters.<br />In WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN, the narrator is insightful and tries to be honest. But I found her so unlikable and alien and, well, largely despicable. Even among the cast behind Eva--her family--there wasn't a single character I could relate to.<br />I also objected to the construction of the book. It runs the risk of being a stilted form, the novel-in-letters, and it always irks me when you get a line like, &quot;You must remember, dear, we first met Joe Stevens when....&quot; with the author then supplying required information the letter recipient was surely already privy to. This novel was rife with awkward exposition.<br />But I kept reading. And that has to count for something. The subject matter is compelling enough that even without likable characters, and even with passages that made me cringe, I stayed with it until the fairly predictable end.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|It's not about the forced ads (although they didn't help) but the movie itself that I finally got to watch early December. I had seen select seens...(the funny ones) on TV multiple time (like the one where Belushi's character is in the cafeteria spitting food out of his mouth &quot;I'm a zit, get it?!&quot; And I thought judging by those scenes and the &quot;you'll like it&quot; coming from my dad that I would enjoy it and went out and bought it @ blockbuster with a gift card I had just recieved. I swear it was the most god awful thing I'd ever seen, and I don't see how anyone could say that it's a classic! I honestly don't see the humor in a bunch of immature frat boys running around looking up girls ass's and causing trouble. It's pointless, stupid, and a waste of a good gift card. (even with the select few chuckle worthy scenes) I was able to sell it, but not for nearly as much as I paid. Good riddens is all I can say!
B00005JMFR|3.0|Man the first two movies were off the chain.  The third movie was actually very good all the way until the end.  The point was to destroy the matrix but that didn't happen.  The machines still rule over the human race and the machines still call all the shots.  This was one of the dumbest endings to a trilogy ever.  It went from destroy the Matrix to destroy Smith.  Smith is evil and can transform everything he touches to evil.  Neo is good and lets Smith transform himself and all his clones into him transforming everything back to good.  How stupid?  The ending made the first two movies basically irrelevant and all their actions ( and my time )wasted motions.  The point was to get rid of the Matrix.  The Matrix still exists...WHY?...stupid.  Well at least we have the masterpiece that is The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy which they actually accomplished what they set out to do...the ring doesn't exist anymore it is destroyed--exactly what they set out to do in the Fellowship.  This was a bust.  <br />What were they fighting for if the Matrix still exists?  They was gearing up for war and all this and that but guess what nothing was accomplished...all of em died.  And at the end the people's choice was to either stay in the 'Matrix' or be freed.  Well....judging by the conditions the freed live in...keep me in the Matrix...at least I won't be eating mush mush regurgitated refried bean soup and live in rags.  At least I won't get killed believing the Matrix was gonna get destroyed but in reality nothing happened.<br />And another thing...since when can machines talk?  How can Neo see without his eyes in the real world?  How can he destroy machines by just putting his hand up in the real world?  And also the only character worth caring about dies.  We still don't know what happened to Neo...they just raise him up and that's it?  Why would the machines care what happens to the matrix they would still heavily outnumber the human race, slaughter them, and then create a new matrix...so what was the point of inserting Neo back into the matrix in the first place? This latest movie destroyed what could of been a great trilogy. Disappointed...
B00009XITQ|5.0|Unfortunately, this will never make the Top Ten lists of those idiotic snobbish critics. It seems these self-important dunces can't recognize great art if it isn't all wrapped up in a big red bow and stamped with the official seal of academic approval. But great art is what this is, by crackey! Simply because the director, the great Umberto Palladino, chose to work in the reviled genre of Hollywood teen romantic comedies, these pretentious cretins can't see what a truly subversive, revolutionary artistic accomplishment we have before us. When Palladino and his sublime cinematographer Kwong-loi Tan repeatedly hold a long, lingering gaze at Amanda's scantily clad torso, the effect is not, as the clodhopping critics aver, exploitative: It is, rather, as brilliant and daring a satire of mindless American pop culture's fixation on the body as could be wrought. Furthermore, by such bold artistic choices, Palladino and Tan are making a profound postmodernist statement about how ideologies, even so-called progressive liberal ideologies, are written on the body...and also BY the body. The Body--qua body--is ineluctable, inescapable: That is one of the many deep meanings of this inexhaustively inventive film. <br />But, alas, the hoi polloi (including our supposed intellectuals) mistake this profound parodic statement for the &quot;real thing&quot; and either ogle it or decry it. Such obtuseness makes one weep a river of tears for our feeble species, which scorns the truly great artists of our time and only lavishes its accolades when these titanic geniuses are long gone and thus no longer able to profit from them.

B000001FDQ|4.0|I will give this 4 stars because when it came out in 1984 it certainly was different.  The compositions on this album are quite spectacular from a guitar playing point of view.  Unfortunately I don't belive Yngwie actually progressed very far after this.  In fact some of the tracks from his latest album are not as good as some of the compositions on this first album.  Credit has to be given for his influence because when this album did come out, so many other speed pickers and sweepers followed soon afterwards.  Shrapnel records have released an awful lot of these shredders, which unfortunatly always seem to play in the same key so thus sound the same.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I remember the first time i heard this album- i wasnt really a huge fan of metal at the time - i liked it and liked metallica for awhile  before then but i wasnt a big fan of metal. Until i heard this album and was blown away. At the time i didnt think any metal  band could be better than metallica but  boy was i wrong megadeth kicks metallicas ***. After months of listening to almost all of megadeths albums and hearing the amazing thought provoking lyrics of dave mustaine i became one of megadeths biggest fans and eventually met them in 99. Im not your typical metal head type and i think that mustaines lyrics are intelligent and he sings about meaningful things and he plays great guitar. I would recomend this album to anyone who hasnt heard megadeth yet- this is first album to get. Highly Recomended.
B000002JR8|1.0|How can anybody give this album 5 stars?  This is one of the worst albums I bought in the nineties.  The songs are daft, the music is more noise then anything.  This is no Testament or Metalicca.  Just trash.
B000002H6C|4.0|This album is pretty good,but i wouldnt say its the greatest.After all,with the death of bassist Cliff Burton(R.I.P),its evident that the band lost  a little enthusiasm and creativity,according to me,of course.Also,Mustaine didnt wrote any solos for this album,unlike on Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning!Without that,Kirk Hammet didnt wrote mindblowing solos,with the exception of the One song,wich is phenomenal.<BR>But hey,its still agreat record.How can you go wrong with Blackened (my personal favorite),And Justice For All,Dyers Eve,One,Harvester Of Sorrow and To live is to die?The rest of the cd in my opinion is bleh...take it or leave it,but the songs above are great and its worth getting just for that.
B000002H2H|5.0|When this first came out very few people had heard of the band.  But, unlike all the Van Halen type bands at the time this band demonstrated a natural transition from Sabbath and Priest.  The opening track is as heavy as hell and the album flows with tightness and the song writing is excellent.  Ride the Lightning and Creeping Death are a couple of Metalicca's best tracks ever.  It's albums like these that demonstrate what can be done.  Much critism has been made about their most recent stuff, but it has to be said that this is the proper Metalicca that most of the fans want.  Perhaps it's because most of theri earlier material was fuelled by alcohol that now we only hear all the cold turkey stuff.
B000069CWE|2.0|I hate this C.D. Always have always will. It's always been on one of my lists of terrible C.D.s. Every time I've listened to it, I was mad at the incredible lack of originality. I think it is a definate sell out. So why is it so bad? Hybrid Theory's songs, \\"remixed\\" on Reanimation, are almost exactly the same! It's almost as if Linkin Park did a \\"copy and paste\\" and called it a new album. Almost exactly the same vocals, guitars, lyrics, structure, overal sound, etc. The only difference in the songs are the occasional skip or break in voice during singing. Couple this with a couple of really dumb skits (i.e.: a ten second message left on a message machine to one of the members of Linkin Park), a couple new songs, and terrible spelling of those songs' titles, and you have Reanimation.<br />  The reason Reanimation managed to get 2 stars is because of it's decent guest appearances by stars (John Davis from Korn, Aaron Lewis from Staind). If you collect everything by Korn or Staind, download the songs in which they appear. Also, the few new songs, such as My Own December and High Voltage, are for Linkin Park fans only (and I even know some fans who don't like My Own December). Linkin Park used these two tactics as selling points, in order to make the album more interesting.<br />  This album is more techno-rap, less rock. Sometimes it seems as if the guitars are completely left out of the music. LP needed to stop touring and write the new album, Meteora. And, although it may be something to listen to during the down time between Hybrid Theory and Meteora, I still think it was a greedy move to release this C.D. Buy it if you are a big, hardcore Linkin Park fan. Otherwise, do not reward Linkin Park for this. And go ahead, give me the \\"not helpful\\" vote, I'm just warning those who like good music.
B00005RYL2|5.0|This is easily the best film of all the Highlander sequals.  An excellent story and well put together with flash backs of Scotland in the fifteenth century.  None of the sequals to this film were really of the same intensity and deepness.  In fact all the follow ups were very lame.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|&quot;Playing by Heart&quot; is one of those quaint movies that you might never have heard of.  I certainly hadn't until cruising around Amazon one day and following a link for Gillian Anderson.  Being interested in seeing her in a role outside of &quot;The X-Files&quot; I ordered this film but for whatever reasons, this DVD sat on the rack until recently.  Clearly, after watching this, I should've checked it out sooner.<br />&quot;Playing by Heart&quot; is hinged upon a star studded cast and a casually paced but well timed and written script that plays very well emotionally.  One cannot help but think that as an ensemble cast, the majority, if not all of the stars of this film, took a significant cut in pay for doing this film, in effect, showing their shared affections for the script.<br />On to this stellar cast, let's see, in alphabetical order; Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Madeline Stowe, WOW!  As expected, it was extremely wonderful to see Gillian Anderson outside of the &quot;Scully&quot; role and it will be nice to see her in future films.  As is usual with Angelina Jolie, she presents an entirely different character in this film and displays perfectly the range of her acting skills.  Overall kudos goes to the entire cast for their collective performances in this wonderful film about life.<br />High praise goes to Willard Carroll for having written and directed this charming and extremely enjoyable film!  This movie apparently won high critical acclaim when it was in the theaters, and it now deserves as much acclaim as it can from those that count, movie watchers who enjoy well scripted and performed movies!  The score plays perfectly to the film as well.<br />The Premise:<br />&quot;Playing by Heart&quot; is an extremely well told story about life, love and the ups and downs that love brings to those that try to embrace it.  The movie cuts frequently between several different couples who are either struggling through the difficulties of burgeoning love, middle years of marriage or the older couple looking back upon their lives together.  <br />What follows from there is a movie that leads to a wonderful ending that is unfortunately a bit predictable but doesn't detract from the experience in any way and in fact actually enhances the experience.  I highly recommend this film to any and all that are fans of good movies!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />This DVD is all about the movie itself!
B00001NFCY|5.0|What I like about this record is that the songs grow on you.  The sound is different and the lyrics are quite deep.  Not to say that their other material is bad, but this album, at least for me is their best.  There is hardly a weak track on this at all.
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Best movie in a loooong time!  Just excellent!  It'll leave you laughing all the way, and touches you also :)  Such a great romantic comedy. Yes, probaly more of a girl movie, but an excellent one you'll wanna see again and again!  Can't wait until it comes out on DVD! Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are a terrfic pair in this movie!
B00012QLQ4|4.0|I find it interesting that Geneon/Pioneer is trying to pass this off as a special value. This regular edition Akira DVD had a normal list price of the same amount when it was first released in 2001. For shame. If Geneon wants to offer us a value price for this DVD, perhaps they should try a list price of $14.98 instead. That might have made amazon.com's discount price more like $12.98 instead of $16.98.<br />Anyway, Akira is one of the greatest anime films of all time and a science fiction masterpiece. Despite Geneon/Pioneer's price deception, don't miss out on this fantastic film if you haven't yet seen it.<br />Note: I would have given this DVD 5 stars if not for Geneon/Pioneer's price deception.
B00005JM02|1.0|I really didn't enjoy this movie. This movie is only for young kids. I found it boring and so make believish. If you want to watch a film the whole family can enjoy watch Pirates of the Caribbean.
B0000B3B95|2.0|Most of this movie is spent introducing the charcters and leading up to the gamma accident that changes him to the HULK. When he does change things really pick up and the movie has interest but, alas this is few and far between.  Bruce Banner  was a whiney little man all wrapped up in strange thoughts and memories. he aslo treats the beautiful Betty like a dog in the beginnning instead of realizing she loved him so much. but worst of all was the way over the top over acting by nick nolte as Banners daddy. he looked and acted like the mess he was in this overblown far-reaching bust of a movie.

B00008L3U1|5.0|This plot is so original, and you know if Robin Williams is in the movie its gonna be hilarious. It was ! Boy that rapidly grows as he ages. Ha too funny. Great to watch with the whole family. Very light hearted film.
0385504209|3.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about.  This novel is a page turner, no doubt about that, with an intriguing plot.  Since there are so many reviews here which go over the story I won't go into it --  However I have to say as one of those people who can look at a painting and NOT see mysterious symbolism and plots all over the place I took this novel for what it was - a work of fiction that was a fast read and that's all.  I don't think Catholics have to get upset over all the theories this story puts forth, since that's all they are: theories for a work of fiction.<br />Characters are well-drawn and the descriptions are good.  I agree with other reviewers that it reads like a movie treatment - it didn't hurt to compare  Robert Langdon to Harrison Ford early in the story, and I agree it was probably intentional.  Can an option for a movie starring Ford be far behind??
B00005JL96|5.0|Very Funny Film. Great for adults and kids to see, I was pleased to watch this film because it cenetered around Hawaiins, usually cartoons center around white characters. Good change. This film was great, except for the whole aliens coming down to get Stitch back.
0679428895|3.0|I was excited to see this on the shelves, but somewhat disappointed in the overall story.  The story focus is on the water engineer Attilius.  He's been sent by Rome to Pompeii to repair a breach in the aquaduct.  The mysterious disappearance of the local Aquarius, the title for the water engineer, factors into the storyline.<br />I love the history of Pompeii and so I wanted to love this book.  Where I feel this book failed me, at least, as a reader was in trying to build up the suspense of the eruption which we know is coming, know will be devastating and result in burying two entire cities at the expense of developing the characters.  There are only a few characters to follow.  Attilius and Corelia, the daughter of the corrupt rich freed slave Ampliatus.  It seems Ampliatus has rebuilt Pompeii from the devastating earthquake that shook the region years before.  Ampliatus is the bad guy here, but the fact he was a former slave takes away the edge of him being the bad guy, at least for me.  To elevate his status in society he is going to marry his daughter Corelia to his former master's son.  Pliny the elder factors into the story as well.. which is fun because I love the blending of fact and fiction.  Unfortunately, Corelia is thinly drawn and has too little to do in the story - we don't even have the benefit of seeing her emotional attachment to Attilius develop.  This is a shame because I eventually cared more about what happened to Pliny than Corelia!  That's because this takes place 3 days before the eruption.  Very little time to throw Attilius and Corelia together since he's trying to repair an aquaduct in the hills.  In fact Pliny has more to do than the heroine in the story.  The ending was a bit blah as well... I'm not in the habit of ruining plots so I won't mention what happens, but it was a big build up and then... a sketchy epilogue, as if even the author wasn't invested enough emotionally in his characters to give them a proper resolution.  Oh well.  I do have to say the description of the town, how citizens and slaves went about their daily lives were all fabulous.  I can't get enough of Pompeii, and it helps if you've been to the ruins to try to place yourself in the story when a town square is described, the mention of fountains etc. In short, Mr. Harris did a fabulous job of making a doomed ancient city come to life.  His characters on the other hand were left out in the cold.  So, overall, in my humble opinion, it was just okay..

B00003CXSM|5.0|This is my favorite J lo film. The plot was good and the cast was great. Good enough to watch with the whole family. Enjoy.
B0000024RZ|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Bob Dylan.  It takes alot of effort to get into, but after several listens, each song succeeds to grab your attention.  A few of the songs could even be taken as &quot;catchy&quot;, especially The Times They Are A-Changin' and When the Ship Comes In.  With God on Our Side is too long, but if you get bored by the melody, you can always listen to the lyrics, so the song is saved from the hubris.  In a way, the album resembles a cubist painting (a school of art which Dylan's own paintings take their cue from), with each song being a &quot;fractle,&quot; to borrow a word from Robert Fripp.  The songs are uniformly discouraging, and totally bleak.  The statement of purpose hands down is When the Ship Comes In,which shows no lightening up in its hatred.  The theme is revenge, when the Old Testement imagry seeks a vengeful, studied catharsis.  As with this song, the entire album gives no respite, anywhere.  This album shows absolutely no sign of redemption.  Dylan shows no sign of giving the nemesises even a crack of sunlight.  One can only guess how much endurance and suffering a man of twenty-two years could have survived to come up with an album so dreadfully powerful.  Out of Dylan's first five albums, this is by far my favorite.  One obvious reason is that (can you believe it?) his voice is way superior to his first album, where the vocals are so slip-shod as to beg the question if Dylan had swallowed living frogs at the recording session. But the real answer is that the songwriting has hit a high water mark.  The only song that consistently annoys is With God on Our Side, and although his voice/guitar/harmonica sound collage might lack interest with people who need to hear drum beats and a thumping rhythmical bass to keep their interest, each song is carefully written with solid, memorable melodies and the scathing anger of the lyrics give this album an almost unique quality.  I qualify my review with the addage &quot;almost unique&quot; because two other artists have tried this hard to be negative, Lou Reed (on Berlin)and Bruce Springsteen (the new Dylan) on Nebraska.  It is worth noting that Bruce Springsteen's album is titled &quot;Nebraska&quot; because the bleakest song on The Times They Are A'Changin' is &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown,&quot; about a destitute South Dakota farmer who kills himself, his wife, and his five children simply because he can't feed them(I doubt even Dylan could tell the difference between the bad lands of Nebraska from the bad lands of the Dakotas.) So the state is different, but the people and their despiration are all the same. The theme is repeated in North Country Blues, where the characters in the song show a total disability to show any emotion or feeling, except for a stupified acceptance for the futility of their plight.  That's the way this album goes, from one bleak resignation to another, leaving the listener to wonder what the album would be like if Dylan had been able to shriek.<BR>     By the way, my review is based on the vinyl copy, so I don't know about the packaging of the CD.  At least in the vinyl version though, there is the companion to the record with the &quot;11 Outlined Epitaphs&quot;, which are 11 attempts by Dylan to write beat poetry. When you consider his age, he succeeds, occasionally grandly. My favorite is the first, which is transcribed verbatim:<BR>&quot;when will he open up his eyes&quot;<BR>&quot;who  him ?  Doncha know? he's a crazy man<BR>he never opens his eyes&quot;<br />&quot;but he'll surely miss the world go by&quot;<BR>&quot;nah! he lives in his own world&quot;<BR>&quot;my my then he really must be a crazy man&quot;<BR>&quot;yeah he's a crazy man&quot;<br />A few listens to this album will make you wake up, but you might never want to open your eyes again.<br />If you really want to give your teenage kid angst, get him the album for his eleventh birthday.  That's what my parents did for me.
B00005JKDR|2.0|This movie should have been good but it didn't appeal to me at all. It didn't even seem funny. I felt like I wasted money because I believed the hype.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Warner's dvd release of one of the best adventure films ever made is one of the best dvds availble. <BR>65 years old, the picture hasn't dated the way most films have. An extraordinary success of all front the picture is as fun and entertaining as it was 65 years ago. Adventures of robin hood is the first great color film. Few films have made such a glorious use of techicolor. Stunning visuals are created with excellent sets, costumes, locations, and photography. The script is smart and funny with dialogue that holds up well. The production assembled one of the greatest ensembles of supporting players that breathed life into colorfully scripted supporting roles. \\"Adventures\\" is one of the best Hollywood films ever made and arguebly the benchmark for all adventure films.<br />Picture quality on the dvd is a knockout. Having seen the film on scratchy vhs, i was blown away by the dvd print. Sharpness and oh the glorious color is brilliant. Obiviously its not perfect there is some tough grain on some scenes and sometimes the focus is soft, but for a film 65 years old to look this good is a miracle. Watching the dvd for the first time i saw so many things that were rendered invisible in the blur and bleed of vhs. Never did the dvd's color bleed, and rarely have i seen such a marvelous example of color on the dvd. The film is in pre widescreen full frame that perserves the aspect ratio, although many tvs still tend to cut off a bit. In my case one title card had the last letters cut in half. <br />Sound is a little less sucessful, but still clear and clean. The mix is recorded low so you have to crank it up. I thought the voices were a little hard to hear over the score in the opening scenes, but the problem was not noticable later. <br />The extra package is one of the best i've ever seen. First you get a wonderful slipcover of the movie poster.<BR>Disc 1 has among other things a brilliant commentary by historian Rudy Behlmer. The man is a genius, his talk is one of themost comprehensive commentaries i've heard. He covers the history of the robin hood legend and english history, incredibly detailed info about where, when and who shot every scene, and indepth background on the production. He talks from his book, but his manner of speaking is far from reading, but very conversational even if the comments are academic. Also on the first disc is an awesome collection of movie trailers from flynn's career. Obviously not every movie is there, but there are over ten and are a fun watch to see how they hyped films back in the day.<br />Disc 2 starts with an extremely informative documentary on technicolor hosted by angela lansbury that is a must watch for anyone interested in film history. The history of color cinema is a subject rarely discussed in detail unlike the history of sound, so i found the doc very insightful. The great rudy behlmer leads the \\"welcome\\" documentary and gives a great look at the production. Those not wanting to sit through the audio commentary should definately watch this because it provides the entire backstory in an engaging format with photos and interviews. Behlmer hosts an outtake reel \\"cutting room\\" with extremely rare footaging including a blooper of a crew guy popping up in the castle when robin swings up the rope. \\"Through the ages\\" is a fabulous behlmer presentation that shows much of the fairbanks silent robin hood and comparisons are made. It is surprising to find that many scenes were copied for \\"adventures\\". \\"Journey\\" is a less interesting set of home video footage of the production with behlmer talking, his knowledge is stunning because he indentifies most of the crew members. Strangley, head director curtiz only appears very briefly. Other cool extras include vintage shorts on the archer howard hill and a flynn boating trip. Hill's archery tricks are fun and the presentation is funny due to corny narration. A huge photo gallery of production art, on set photos, and historical robin hood art is included, but is hard to navigate because they play as a timed slide shows without any control over changing the image. <br />Adventures of Robin Hood is great entertainment for the whole family that hasn't lost its charm in 65 years. The warner dvd is one of the most complete extra packages i've seen. The beautiful print and bucket load of extras are unheard for a film this old. Ruby behlmer's interviews and commentary present the most indepth look into a film i've seen. Adventures of robin hood my choice for dvd of the year.
B000067J1Y|5.0|Classic 90's film. Charlie Sheen and cast are very funny. Don't try to make sense out of the film, its just one big blunder of mishaps and follies. Enjoy.
B000060P79|3.0|this cd....well maybe should get 4 stars for thos eof the avid listeners of wanna be punk rock but just ends up to be pop punk..<BR>i mean come on...its soo obviously pop with the guitar strings in the background...without the &quot;look&quot; of simple plan, i would mistake them for another one of those boy band, BSB thing.<br />so if you're looking for true punk rock, maybe you should try good charlotte's 2ND CD. not 1st BUT SECOND.<BR>don't try this cd<br />but if you're looking for britney spears' friends in the music business sound...cope this cd..
B00000J7RZ|1.0|The only good song on this cd is waiting for tonight. Other than that, don't bother getting this album, She really CAN'T sing.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have to say, this cd took my breath away!!! This was my first cd of his that I listened to (my aunt gave it to me b/c she had extra copies) and I completely fell in love with his voice. The first cd is also excellent, but I think I like this one more. I think what makes this cd so wonderful is the level of passion that Josh puts in to each and every song. Some of my favorite songs are \\"Oceano\\", \\"My Confession\\", \\"When You Say You Love Me\\", and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" However, my absolute favorite is \\"Mi Mancherai\\" especially with the beautiful violin accompanying it. That song especially has so much passion, you just want to start singing with him! <br />He sings in Italian, Spanish, French, and English, and let me say he sounds like he was born speaking each of these languages. For those that have complained in their reviews that you don't like this cd b/c he doesn't sing in English and you can't understand...maybe you should try exposing yourself to more cultural things. For one, it's not that hard to look up the translations on the internet. Also, even without understanding the words, I can still interpret what he's singing about. Josh has the wonderful ability to convey emotion and passion through his voice and music, he doesn't need the words to do that for him. I still want to laugh or cry when I hear his songs, regardless of whether or not I understand the words. I also think it's great that the other languages help make the cd appeal to other cultures, not just english speaking countries.<br />He wrote the lyrics to \\"Remember When It Rained\\", which is an absolutely stunning piece, and coproduced 2 other songs I believe. I think it's great that he helped with at least a few songs, it shows that he's dedicated to his work. I strongly recommend this cd, it's definitely worth it! I definitely expect to be hearing more from him in the future, he's an incredibly talented young man and I highly recommend this cd!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is so hilarious. Great for adults and Kids. I loved the ending the most when all of Walt Disney World dances. Oh what Fun !!! I love this film and I am not even a kid.
0790729628|3.0|I liked the movie as originally produced.  For those that also do and are afraid to say it; IT'S OKAY TO DISAGREE!  The money maker for this film will be a new release with both adaptations and in widescreen format with enhanced sound.  Some say the new version more closely resembles the original Dick story.  If, by saying that some of the names are the same creates a resemblance, then I suppose that is true.  No mater what version you like, the movie is a classic and a great work for your Harrison Ford collection.
B00005UKKF|3.0|I would give her more stars if she really sang, all she did was lip sync. And the last part of the concert was a total strip tease. Britney and company should have more taste since Kiddies are at her concert.
0780622642|1.0|This movie stunk worse than 99 skunks in a dump. I hated this thing. I don't know what they were talking about. They could have spent all of that money they used to make this movie to cure cancer. Bad movie! AHHH! Change it! Change it!
B00004SCX6|1.0|I am not really sure how anyone can like this crap but if somone can find a good reason please write a review informing me. Her voice is really annoying, the lyrics are laughable and the subject matter is........ In fact I am not sure at times what she is talking about. This album is for ages 7 and under. No one else is supposed to like it and nobody else should like it. So unless you are 7 years or younger DONT BUY THIS!
B00005JMCW|4.0|I honestly enjoyed the new version of Freaky Friday.  The original was a classic from my childhood, but the remake is a more then suitable replacement.<br />The storyline is simple and predictable as a typically self-absorbed teenage girl and her overworked mother switch places to see how the other half lives.  This is thanks to a magic fortune cookie delivered by an elderly Chinese woman who was just trying to help them.  Unfortunately this switch occurs two days before the mother's wedding and the day before her daughter has a major honors test at school.  From the minute this occurs, we know that each character will mature before the end of the show and will help the other in a way they didn't think was possible.  It does happen, but it was sure fun to watch.<br />This is a great movie if you're looking to simply let your mind guy and be entertained.  It succeeds and the lead roles are perfectly acted to make us care what the outcome will be.  I highly recommend this film.  It's one that you can truly enjoy with your family.
B000023VR6|4.0|This is a good rap album but it is not as good as The original Chronic. This cd has some classics like Still Dre, What's The Difference, The Next Episode, and Forgot About Dre. Still Dre sounds like it could be put on the original Chronic. It is so nicely done with the piano beat and the great lyrics. Its greatness almost is like Let Me Ride or, Nuthin But A G Thang. The rest of the songs on here are average or below average. The four tracks that I mentioned gives it 4 stars. Not a classic but still one to be put in your collection.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|I've seen the trailer for this quite a few times. I don't know why I've never gone out and rented the film or something. Mind you, I know nothing about cars, so I was lost for most of this film. And I didn't learn anything either.<br />What was disappointing about this film was that Angelina Jolie didn't exactly have a big role, or as much screen-time as Nicolas Cage or Giovanni Ribsi. She's one of my favourite actresses, and I suppose that was the only reason I wanted to see the film. Although seeing Giovanni Ribsi didn't hurt.<br />It took a long time to start, and the storyline was supposed to be that Nicolas Cage's character (Memphis) had to steal 50 cars in 4 days. By the time the film dragged out, he only had one night to steal them all. And it was so predictable how one of the cars would be \\"late\\" being stolen, or would get held up.<br />Possibly a film for car fans. Not for others.
B00005U18E|5.0|I was not a big Rene Zellweger fan until this movie.  Maybe it's not really her, maybe it's the character I fell in love with.  I, myself am a Briget Jones type person, always saying the wrong thing and saying it badly (like I'm doing here???), always getting into predicaments without even trying, so I identified with her and understood her right away.  Her friends are all whacky but but lovable and who love her too.  Which is what I love so much about this story.  Bridget finds a man who loves her just the way she is...with all her silly faults.
B00005V9IK|4.0|This film paved the way for other world-obliterating movies such as Armageddon and Dante's Peak. OK, I know they're not technically all the same, but they are very similar. Armageddon is one of my favourite movies, and I can see a lot of similarities between that &amp; Independence Day.<br />I don't know why I've only decided to watch this movie nearly eight years after its original release. I will admit to reading the book based on the movie. That could have put me off seeing the movie, as it was mind-numbingly boring. But when I watched the movie, I found myself recognising characters and knowing what was going to happen to them, and recognising the lines too. So obviously the book had some impact on me, despite sending me to sleep most nights.<br />I was shocked to read that this was the biggest box office success of 1996 - you'd think something like that would tempt me to go and see it at the cinema! I saw Titanic twice at the cinema, and watched the video about a zillion more times. Independence Day grossed about $746m around the world, and a mere $306m alone in the USA.<br />There are some spectacular effects in this, including seeing The White House getting blown up, LA/New York etc being reduced to rubble (very Terminator-esque) and some very cute aliens appear in a lab (are they available to buy?)<br />Some great actors appear in this film - Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum being his usual eccentric self, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin and . . . Harry Connick Jnr?! There has to be some mistake there. Will Smith was great in this, although there was a big sigh of disappointment when he got out of the bed wearing boxers. Damn.<br />This must have been great to see at the cinema. The sound is fantastic watching it on DVD with a great sound system. I was fearing for the neighbours next door, as my chair was shuddering beneath me, and took a few minutes before the vibrations stopped! Of course, with a great sound system, whether in the cinema or at home, there were nearly a few accidents. I literally jumped out my skin a couple of times, and to persuade my heart to go back to its usual place in my body, rather than in my throat!<br />If you haven't seen this film, you have to go and see it.

B00005JMCN|5.0|I bought this movie since we got a DVD player for Christmas, and we have 2 horses... even if you are not a horse lover, I think you will like it.  I sat down to only plan watching 20 minutes of it, (going to sleep) and I couldn't stop watching! Great movie!  I will watch again.  Worth the purchase.  People I know who don't even like horses, recommended this movie to me!  Buy it today!
B00005CDNI|5.0|I've been an ABBA fan since 1980 when they released their spanish LP titled \\"Gracias por la Musica\\". My mom had purchased that LP for herself but because the songs were fabulous, I took sole possession of it. The girls sang so beautifully in spanish that for 2 years I thought ABBA was a latin group. Fast forward 2 years later and I saw this album up on a department store glass showcase. A couple of violent tugs at my mom's coat and the record was mine.<br /><br />Many have classified ABBA as pure disco but this is the closest they ever got to that particular music genre. Their other albums were mostly pop with maybe a few disco flavoured tunes thrown in. Whether you're a fan of disco or not, VOULEZ-VOUS is music to the ears. The songs offered are all catchy with exquisite vocals and tight intricate harmonies. Agnetha and Frida never sounded better than on this CD. The contrast between their voices is clearly evident in this album even more so than their other records.<br /><br />Frida's sultry and sexy lower register is at it's vocal best in \\"The King Has Lost His Crown\\" and \\"Lovers(Live a Little Longer)\\". Agnetha's voice is at its most stunning in \\"As Good as New\\". Her high pitched belt is energetic, and lively. Not many singers can belt out those high notes but Agnetha makes it sound easy. Her vocal work in \\"Chiquitita\\" is also outstanding. She starts off softly but really digs in to the chorus and Frida adds her trademark vocals into the harmony. One of my favourite songs on this album is the appealing \\"If it Wasn't for the Nights\\". The song itself is completely over the top in every conceivable way but it's irresistable nontheless. This song is definitely one of the albums highlights and showcases the raw talent of both female singers. Although they're both singing in unison for the most part during the verse, we still get to hear the delightful contrast of their voices. Frida's Mezzo soprano is predominant during the sections \\"Keeping me so busy/All the day through/They're the things that keep me from thinking of you\\"..etc while Agnetha impresses and is predominant during \\"Ohhh baby I miss you so/I know I'm never gonna make it....\\" and during the chorus. This song is outstanding and should have been released as a single. It may have been a little too long for radio play but that could have been easily remedied by skillful editing.<br /><br />VOULEZ-VOUS (the album) did good business internationally. It reached #4 on the Album charts here in Canada, it reached #1 in the UK and made the Top 20 in the US.<br /><br />The song \\"Summer Night City\\" was originally intended for the album but was left out. It is included here as a bonus track. I guess they didn't think the song was good enough. ABBA would make this a habit as \\"Lovelight\\" (also included in this edition as a bonus track) and \\"Dream World\\" (not included) were also recorded but kept off the album (and some wonderful songs would be archived including the now mythic-among-fans \\"Just Like That\\" which can be heard on YOUTUBE BTW in it's various versions). However they still released \\"Summer Night City\\" as a single in 1978 (before the album was released) and it peaked in the Top 5 (UK) and the Top 40 (Canada). It was never released as a single in the US. The singles released from the album also did well. In the UK- \\"Voulez-Vous\\", \\"Angeleyes\\", Chiquitita\\", \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" and \\"I have a Dream\\" all reached the Top 5. Another single released that year, \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" peaked at #3- however that single was not included in the original album.<br /><br />In North America, the songs did fairly well also, \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" reached #8 in Canada and #19 in the US. \\"Chiquitita\\" reached #17 in Canada and #29 in the US. \\"Angeleyes\\" (CAN #39, US #64) & \\"Voulez-Vous\\" (CAN #42, US #80) were both minor hits.<br /><br />VOULEZ-VOUS is one of ABBA's most energetic albums. The songs are fun and melodic but in my opinion, one of the greatest assets to this recording is the wonderful vocals by the girls. ABBA fans may cite other albums such as \\"Super Trouper\\", \\"Arrival\\" or \\"The Visitors\\" as their most accomplished but no other album really showcases the beauty and brilliance of their vocals like this one. It doesn't hurt that the songs they are singing are fantastic.te other albums such as \\"Super Trouper\\", \\"Arrival\\" or \\"The Visitors\\" as their most accomplished but no other album really showcases the beauty and brilliance of their vocals like this one.

B0000E6I1J|5.0|This tribute to George's music and life is an incredibly poignant reminder of how much Mr. Harrison mattered, and how much he is missed.<br />I was brought into this world around the time of 33 &amp; 1/3, so watching &amp; listening to &quot;Concert For George&quot; wasn't, for me, like taking a stroll down nostalgia lane. I feel really fortunate that I was able to discover the Beatles &amp; George's solo work a bit independently of any trend or fashion. And what a discovery!<br />There is no one more qualified than Eric Clapton in spearheading this event. Obviously he &amp; George were great friends, and Clapton's understanding &amp; love for Harrison's music is utterly apparent. Eric gives us gorgeous renditions of &quot;If I Needed Someone,&quot; &quot;Beware Of Darkness,&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot; Clapton's anguished solo on the latter is breathtaking.<br />For me the biggest surprise and delight of the show was the performance of Joe Brown. I had never heard him perform before, and I was blown away by his idiosyncratic voice &amp; dignified renditions of George's songs. Of all the musicians present that evening, Joe Brown's musical approach on these songs most closely resembled George's. His version of &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; follows the original closely, yet still retains an appealing freshness. &quot;That's The Way It Goes&quot; was the most adventurous choice of the show set-list (it wasn't a hit or a Beatles song), but Brown's mandolin textures &amp; soft voice fit this Gone Troppo classic perfectly. This song, along with Browns' moving rendition of &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams&quot;, are in my opinion the highlights of the night, and both brought tears to my eyes.<br />Another moving highlight was the performance of Billy Preston. Preston gives us an incredible &quot;Isn't It A Pity,&quot; and a soulful rendition of &quot;My Sweet Lord.&quot; Gary Brooker gives a rowdy rendition of &quot;Old Brown Shoe,&quot; and the Sam Brown &amp; Jools Holland performance of &quot;Horse To Water&quot; is powerful. Incidentally, this performance is not included on the CD; nor are the Monty Python songs. Michael Palin gives a HILARIOUS &quot;tribute&quot; (which is in the same vein as the &quot;Oh Lord, You Are So Absolutely Huge&quot; prayer in &quot;The Meaning Of Life&quot;) that I'm sure would have brought a broad smile to George's face.<br />Anoushka Shankar's rendition of &quot;The Inner Light&quot; is incredible. Her virtuosity is apparent on &quot;Your Eyes,&quot; and the Ravi Shankar composition is brilliant, of course. &quot;Arpan&quot; captures the essence, in my opinion, of George's spiritual searching and eventual contentment. This piece is both imposing and playful.<br />Ringo's contributions are excellent, and they show the flip side of George's image as a serious mystic. &quot;Photograph&quot; is immaculate pop, and &quot;Honey Don't&quot; is of the country/rockabilly tradition that both George &amp; Ringo loved.<br />Jeff Lynne &amp; Tom Petty were obvious choices for the concert; sadly, their performances are the weakest of the evening. I have never really cared for Jeff Lynne's voice, and he sounds particularly strained on &quot;Wah Wah&quot;. His vocals are much better on &quot;The Inner Light&quot; and &quot;Give Me Love,&quot; but I feel that his voice really isn't suited for these songs. Lynne's crooning of the Roy Orbison parts on &quot;Handle With Care&quot; is excellent. Tom Petty's rendition of &quot;Taxman&quot; seems a little uninspired, and Mr. Petty's singing on &quot;Handle With Care&quot; is not-that-great. His version of &quot;I Need You&quot; is superb, though. Don't get me wrong, I'm really glad that they were there &amp; they are both obviously capable musicians. I just think that maybe they had an off-night.<br />Which brings us to Paul McCartney. He gives a great performance of &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; which is ironic since he &amp; Lennon deemed it unworthy to be on a Beatles' record. McCartney &amp; Clapton deliver a beautiful version of &quot;Something,&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot; is excellent. It must be said though that McCartney seems to have a compulsive need to always be the center of attention. His interrupting Joe Brown to make a joke was irritating, and perhaps in a weird way fitting, since McCartney apparently got under George's skin quite a bit. Tellingly, McCartney's interruption isn't included on the CD.<br />This CD/DVD set is a fantastic tribute, and whatever minor flaws that may exist are completely irrelevant in comparison to the powerful performances given by artists that all loved George Harrison &amp; his great music.it unworthy to be on a Beatles' record.

B0000214F0|5.0|A few years back there was quite a controversy over some shot-on-video garbage called 'Baise Moi' solely on it's inclusion of hardcore pornography (I have a bootleg and believe me it's a mere 30 secs over the total running time of the film). A lot of sheltered mainstream viewers were confused and bewildered, but there was nothing original or daring about 'Baise Moi'. Needless to say all the attention cast a great spotlight on an otherwise worthless film and the people responsible for it made off like bandits. Anyone who was \\"shocked\\" by 'Baise Moi' should definitely stay away from Caligula, which makes the overhyped 'Baise Moi' look PG-13 by comparison!<br />Towards the end of the 70's there was a vibe that pornography would be absorbed into mainstream movies. Not too far fetched considering then X-rated films such as 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Clockwork Orange' were winning awards and critical acclaim, also in Europe there were plenty of horror/exploitation films that blended full blown pornography into the genre for example Joe D'amato's 'Emanuelle in America' 'Erotic Night of the Living Dead' 'Porno Holocaust', Jess Franco's 'Female Vampire' 'Doriana Grey', Jean Rollin had put out a few and there was a fantastic little film called 'Thriller:a Cruel Picture' which should be out on DVD early this year! With this in mind Bob Guccione got the rights to a Gore Vidal screen play, hired top actors Malcom McDowell, Peter O'Tool and Helen Mirren then enlisted the services of Italian director Tinto Brass (who later removed his name after Guccione shot extra scenes) to create the most expensive porno in history.<br />I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed Caligula and genuinely feel it's a great film! A lot of people nit pick small historic anomalies or make unfounded blanket statements such as \\"the acting was bad\\" or \\"the story was pointless\\" to hide the fact that their own prudish tastes and inhibitions won't allow them to accept Caligula as the daring and unique piece of film making that it is. Now I respect the opinions of people who say Caligula is too graphic for them or there were scenes which offended them as make no mistake about it there are scenes in this film which will alienate anyone who isn't familiar with quite sordid pornography. Plenty of intelligent viewers will surely consider this film to be in bad taste, which is perfectly acceptable. However ignore intellectual posers who would have you believe this film is worthless simply because they are not big enough to say \\"personally I did not like it\\". Too many small minded people have the out dated view that all pornography is evil and while it's acceptable that not everybody is into porn, please do take a look where this book burning mentality leads before you endorse the ideals of censorship.<br />If you want to accuse this film of being historically inaccurate, pointless, badly directed and poorly acted, you should go write reviews for 'Titanic' 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Moulin Rouge' first. Caligula has more style and resonance than all of those films put together. For better or worse Caligula would surely get a more powerful reaction from an audience than any film you could see in the cinema today. Let's face it Hollywood has not produced anything vaguely original or challenging in more than a decade.<br />Another thing which irritates me is all these haters who attack Teresa Ann Savoy for her \\"bad acting\\". I feel she is a fine actress, so what if she doesn't mind taking her clothes off. Julia Roberts today gets the fattest paychecks for a female actor and she has done nothing but star in meaningless garbage and is incapable of playing anything but the same shallow character. Savoy is cool, sexy and has great expressiveness. Check out her other Tino Brass film 'Salon Kitty'.<br />Image Entertainment's DVD is good, but for those who are true fans of this film you may want to check out the remastered 2-disc French release available from amazon France. For those who are prudish or sensitive viewers, give Caligula a miss altogether, theres a new 'Troy' movie coming out with Brad Pitt which would better suite you.<br />PS If anybody knows where you can pick up a copy of the mythical 210 minute version, I would greatly appreciate an email!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This tribute to George's music and life is an incredibly poignant reminder of how much Mr. Harrison mattered, and how much he is missed.<br />I was brought into this world around the time of 33 &amp; 1/3, so watching &amp; listening to &quot;Concert For George&quot; wasn't, for me, like taking a stroll down nostalgia lane. I feel really fortunate that I was able to discover the Beatles &amp; George's solo work a bit independently of any trend or fashion. And what a discovery!<br />There is no one more qualified than Eric Clapton in spearheading this event. Obviously he &amp; George were great friends, and Clapton's understanding &amp; love for Harrison's music is utterly apparent.

0385504209|5.0|Great book for women - page turner - Makes me want to help bring the balance between the male and female energy.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I gotta say I am disappointed in some of these reviews attacking Alicia's \\"attitude\\" and lack of talent. Its kinda ridiculous, especially if you really listened to this album. This Cd is soooo good. Its great actually. This album is soulful, sexy, intense, real, unique... Need I say more? The lyrics are so emotional and deep. I love how she takes you through a journey from the 1960s to now with out skipping a beat. She is definitely a talented young lady. She bridges the gap between old soul and new soul allowing our generation to really appreciate older music from that era. <br />My favorite tracks are Karma, Heartburn- So funky and different,please keep a open mind with this song, you will love it. Ofcourse You dont know my name, If I aint got you- I love this song so much, its a beautiful ballad, the emotion of her voice is intoxicating. Diary is really nice laid back song feat Tony Toni Tone, Dragon Days is a sexy sensual song about missing someone, one of my favorites. Wake up is a song that sounds like a straight thowback song of the sixties- very soulful. When you really love someone is like A Womans Worth part 2, yet fresh and nice- I love it. I even love the interlude- Feeling me feeling you- reaaly nice. Slow down sounds more of a radio r&B song but has a great message and still is a great song.<BR> This is a Cd that you sit in the tub with some scented candles and just groove to or listen to while you driving- either way, Its a really good CD. I definitely recommend this to anyone!!!1
B00008ADPF|5.0|this is an amazing album from an amazing band. maybe they are just jealous?
0380789035|3.0|I bought this book amidst critical acclaim and some really great hype.  And maybe that was a bad thing.  It probably made me expect more from American Gods than one should fairly expect from any novel.  Still, I can't change the past, and the fact remains that I found Gaiman's novel to be strictly average in almost every facet.<br />The main plot follows a man named Shadow (ugh) who has recently been released from prison after his wife died in a car accident.  With nothing left in his life, Shadow gains employment under the mysterious Mr. Wednesday and enters into a world of con artists and grizzled old gods.<br />Now, with a plot like that, you'd think the story would write itself and you'd have an excellent novel on your hands.  Well, you would ... if you didn't bog the entire project down with thinly-veiled allegories galore.<br />Don't get me wrong:  I didn't miss the point of the book.  I &quot;got&quot; all there was to get.  But just because a book forces blunt symbolism into its story like jamming a square peg into a circle hole DOESN'T make it a classic.  American Gods will make you think a bit, but its hardly the life-altering tome some of these people are trying to make it out to be.  It probably didn't help that the only likeable people in the story were a few of the supporting characters (primarily Wednesday and Mr. Nancy).<br />All in all, its not going to kill you to read this book.  It isn't what I'd call terrible.  But if you've read anything even remotely similar to it, you'll be wishing it was THAT you were reading instead of this.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|\\"L'Auberge Espanole\\"(\\"The Spanish Apartment\\") is a highly entertaining french film released in 2003.  It was deservingly nominated for six Cesar awards(the french equivalent for the Oscar) and won one.  It explores a college man's, Xavier, unhappiness and the great lengths he'd go to find himself and discover where he belongs.  As an added bonus, it blends many different European cultures(french, spanish, german, italian, and english) as seen especially in the apartment.  Such details give audiences the added viewing interest.  Its combination of comedy and drama offer many twists and turns in various scenes.  During the heavier comedic scenes, the writers add emotional impact in the perfect places.  The plot's creative aspects give added viewing pleasure.  The actors wonderfully add their own theme impact in their roles.  Audrey Tautou's role as Xavier's long distance girlfriend most capitalizes this.  Though her role is small, she has one of the biggest movie impact.  Romain Duris, another big movie impact actor, plays Xavier beautifully.  He proves that he may become a big-name actor in the near future.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.  \\"L'Auberge Espanole\\" is a great movie for those looking for a unique comedy.  This is sure to be an unforgettable experience for many.
0345452577|1.0|I love J Kellerman's books, and couldn't wait to get my hands on the latest one. I didn't mind that it is not part of the Ales Delaware &quot;series&quot; - I very much enjoyed Butcher's Theatre, and Billy Straight. But this latest book is so incredibly longwinded and boring! I cannot get into it, I do not care for any of the characters, and I am now on page 278, and still haven't found anything interesting in this book. I will finish it (sometime), just because it is by Jonathan Kellerman. But I think it will go to the 2nd hand bookshop straight away - and I still have all his previous novels, and reread them again and again. PLEASE - no more Dr Carrier!!
0800141806|5.0|\\"Philadelphia\\", based on a true story, is one of the best releases of 1993, starring Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Mary Steenbergen, Antonio Banderes, and more.  Its production was extra crutial being that during the time of release, many were still severely fearing AIDS.  The producers accomplish every scene wonderfully.  The movie's portrayal of AIDS and its victims is very accurate to reality.  The plot was written beautifully, though sad.  It explores more than just AIDS; it explores discrimination against those who have it and against homosexuals.  Such combination remains ahead of its time.  The plot becomes more interesting as Andy Beckett's lawyer becomes more educated about such issues and begins changing his beliefs about them.  Its emotional impact is intense, never held back for a second.  It forces audiences to feel the events.  The movie is more than entertainment; it's also educational.<br />Tom Hanks's Oscar winning performance as Beckett is heartwrenching.  His every drop of heart and soul was poured through his performance.  His previous hardcore research about the lifestyle, the disease, and the actual events is obvious.  This is one of many movies that proves that Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in history.  Denzel Washington's performance as Beckett's lawyer is beautiful.  His acting skill proves very crutial in his character's personality and point of view.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles wonderfully.  Everyone, including Hanks and Washington, offers their own useful emotional prospective to this movie.<br />Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning song \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\" is a beautiful way to begin the movie.  Its dark theme matches the plot perfectly.  It also offers new prospectives to the movie.  This song will be a classic in the following years.  The original score was also composed beautifully(not by Springsteen), giving the movie more intensity and emotion.<br />The make-up team's research of AIDS and itsvictims proved highly crutial.  Their work on Tom Hanks was highly accurate to reality.  There were no flaws to the physical symptoms, ranging from skin tone, changing hair color, lesions, and eyes.<br />\\"Philadelphia\\" is a great movie for those looking for a powerdrama.  This is sure to please audience for many years to come.
B00005QK3W|4.0|McCartney. Living legend. Ex-Beatle. Probably still more known than Jesus. Anything he records will always be picked apart by critics simply because he is such a famous figure. But at any rate, even when it's McCartney, good is still good...And the Driving Rain album is good! Many people say it's even better than Flaming Pie, but I still find Flaming Pie a more enjoyable listen than Driving Rain. Driving Rain has too many &quot;lesser&quot; (if not lame) songs too similar to Flowers in the Dirt stuff, one of my least favorite Mac albums. The quality is there, of course, but the songs I'm referring to just sound unexciting, if not too long (repetitive) as well. But don't get me wrong, the muscianship rules, and it's still a great album collectively. And I actually like &quot;Riding Into Jaipur&quot; best! It has such a wonderful sound and great musical atmosphere, I love it. Reminds me of why &quot;McCartney&quot; is actually my fav Mac album. I hope Mac continues his trend of musical genious!
B00009TB5G|5.0|THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING seemed unsurpassable.  But it happened!  And that's because now we have THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS, a moviemaking masterpiece second only to three films: THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GODFATHER, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING.  The film deals with the Fellowship after their seperation.  Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to Mt. Doom; at the same time, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) are fighting a vicious battle against the forces of evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).  The effects are astounding, the script 100% absorbing, the direction fantastic and beautiful, and the acting flawless.  Not to mention that the score (by Howard Shore) is perfect.  This is true moviemaking magic.<br />DVD: The Extended Version of the film is awesome!  If such a thing is possible, it's even better than the original version of THE TWO TOWERS!  Not to mention it's loaded with two extra discs of in-depth featurettes and other cool special features.  This is an essential DVD for anyone and everyone.  Even better, Tolkien fans will enjoy it even more!<br />What can I tell you, other than Buy It NOW!!
B00005JLRT|2.0|In more than twenty-five years of watching Trek, from childhood on, I have never been so disillusioned with the series. Never before have I been so ... frankly, bored. The Romulans are my favorite villains and were completely wasted here. I expect some Star Trek fans (the minority who feel it is wrong to criticize any Star Trek story, any time) to therefore find this review \\"unhelpful,\\" which is too bad - I cared very deeply for this series, and for many of the characters, but the actors seem tired.<br />Given time - and by that, I mean time away, with the franchise hibernating for a while, kind of like Disney and their \\"vault\\" for animation releases - Star Trek will probably come back and regain the love and loyalty of both diehard fans and the average person who enjoys these adventures. Star Trek can get away with being goofy or politically incorrect, then too politically *correct* - and still tell a classic tale. Having rewatched \\"First Contact,\\" it still holds up years later, marvelously, and the Borg are if anything more menacing than they were on the TV show. But now the series needs time off.<br />While this will probably antagonize Battlestar Galactica purists, I recommend tracking down some web-based interviews with Ronald D. Moore, who left Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and discussed very candidly the problems accumulating with Voyager, Enterprise and this movie, and how televised science fiction could grow. Even if you hate Moore's version of Galactica, that interview will help you appreciate the tensions that went into the most recent incarnations of Star Trek, and why so many ardent fans have stopped watching. For real entertainment, of course, you could just get \\"First Contact\\" or \\"Wrath of Khan\\".<br />...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love Britney Spears and her music the day she first appeared in the music business. Her songs on this album show her maturity as a women. My absolute favourite song is Toxic. The beat is awesome and is one of the best beats out there. Her voice may not be like other divas but her voice is appealing, pure and high. The worst song is Early mornin. The song is about waking up after a party with a hangover. This is an album that will stay in my cd player for a long time. I never get bored with this cd. I think Britney will be in this music business for a long time just like most divas: Madonna, Celine Dion, Cher, Mariah Carey etc. Buy this album right I'm telling you every penny is worth it. If you don't buy this album you will miss out the beauty of music.
6303347657|5.0|This movie, I think, shows both sides of Jim Carrey.  It shows his well-known Master of Murph, his serious side, his heroic side, and even a bit of a witty side.  Yoiu know, BIOTH of them.  LOL.  Anyhoo, The Mask is a comic delight, for Jim Carrey fans and the people without a sense of humour.
B0000019PA|3.0|The past reviews talked it up like it was the greatest album in the world, so of course I was disappointed when I heard it.  But it's not bad.  Lyrics: good, melodies: wonderful, vocals... eh, not for me.  Hey, you can't please everybody, but I respect this band and this album, and I bought another copy for a friend who I think this album is perfect for.  Just make sure you listen to the sound clips provided before buying it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This would be the best album from linkin park to date. Each song has a unique difference than all the others.. and they did a great jobe of keeping the songs flowing from one another. Overall it is an awsome almub that i would recament to any type of music listener. I will leave you breathless and your finger sore [ repeat ;-) ]  and be sure to look into this.

B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie answers the question, What if it were all real?  It's a hysterical parody of sci-fi convention culture, mixed with the genuine surprise that - Hey, those phasers aren't shooting blanks.  I was a bit skeptical that Tim Allen could pull off the larger than life role of the captain of a starship; but, nobody warned him that it couldn't be done.  It's a movie about rising to meet the expectations of the people who depend on you most.
0385504209|4.0|You know, kids (and I'm speaking here to the many reviewers who found the book unbelievable), you could use the same arguments to insist that James Bond stories are unbelievable, the Hobbits are just &quot;little people,&quot; and that amateur detectives can't solve mysteries better than the police because they don't have the latest hi-tech gear.<br />And if Mr. Brown takes any of it to heart, I'm sure he cries all the way to the bank.<br />If you're going to read *anything!* having to do with Knights Templar, the Grail, the early history of the Church, secret societies, or France in general, you need to just sit back and enjoy the nutty ride.<br />CONS:<br />The &quot;quick-cut, planning for the movie&quot; style does gets old if not done really well (it's done mostly well).  The flashback transitions are kind of crude, especially at the beginning.<br />Some of the plot twists (especially at the end) arise from the author's selective portrayal of events in *our* POV (read &quot;misdirection&quot;), rather than the character POV.  This left me feeling a bit manipulated (I prefer the author to have the decency to hide his/her manipulations of me and leave it to my wife to point it out later).<br />Those familiar with the core backstory elements will find Brown's portrayal of them simplistic, and the novel's experts' acceptance of a sole track of grail lore a bit bothersome.  Those who are unfamiliar with same will find it all very alarming and whacky, especially Christians who've grown up with the &quot;based on historical events&quot; belief set.<br />PROS:<br />It's fun.  I stayed up until 4am the other night reading it, and finished it the next night, and I don't usually do that.  A page-turner is a page-turner and that gets points.<br />Excellent descriptions of place.  People are pretty well-drawn (except Teabing, who comes off as dialog and crutches); but even when you lose track of who is saying or thinking what, they are drawn well enough that you can almost always work it out without back-tracking.<br />Despite my problems with Brown's interpretations of research (and &quot;Hello!&quot; this is a novel), there's been a lot of new research since Holy Grail, Holy Blood was published in the early 80's.  It's probably all bunk, but it's bunk that surrounds the very human creation of the Catholic Church in the 3rd century, which is not well-documented, the events of which very much were shrouded in secrecy, and which goes to the heart of the faith that dominates Western thinking.  I find this fascinating.<br />VERDICT:  A great airplane or beach book.  Whether you want to read it as part of your daily dose of novels will probably depend on personal preferences.  I'm a one novel every month or so kind of guy, and I sucked it down in four days.most always work it out without back-tracking.<br />Despite my problems with Brown's interpretations of research (and &quot;Hello!&quot; this is a novel), there's been a lot of new research since Holy Grail, Holy Blood was published in the early 80's.

0743490304|4.0|I have so far read 3 of Dan Brown's books (Angel & Demons, DaVinci Code and Deception Point) and three features of his writings stand out. First, audacious plotlines; Brown does not believe in small measures but goes out on a limb. The plotlines are over the top but have just that crucial amount of credibility to draw in a reader, even when he knows it is fiction. Second, the pace is mercilessly quick; the entire plot of the book plays out over a few days at most. Last but for me the best of all, his books have a wealth of esoteric information that one would not normally read about. I found myself enthralled by a never ending series of factoids that had me rushing to the Internet for explanation or elaboration.<br />Deception Point is faithful to the above. Set in the midst of the political intrigues of an American presidential campaign, filled with all the stereotypes of corporate fat cats, sex, money and the works, Brown segues brilliantly between the frigid Arctic and mainland USA, from high-tech weaponry and devices to scientific theorizing. An apparent discovery of evidence of extra-terrestrial life seems set to decide the election campaign when disturbing evidence begins to emerge that the \\"find\\" may well be one of the biggest frauds of history. In a race to find the truth, the action moves seamlessly from the Arctic to Washington, to the Atlantic Ocean. It is not hard to identify the villain though and Brown makes little attempt to draw us off track.<br />Brown's characters seem hurriedly sketched to the point of being cardboard cutouts and his endeavor to add a dash of romance is so scripted as to be unbelievable. Yet, this is a good book for all that, engrossing, hard to put down and loaded with interesting tidbits.
0688163173|5.0|U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels has been sent to Shutter Island to find a missing patient. A simple chase down the clues, add them and solve the mystery kind of book.<br />Yeah, right.<br />The premise of this novel is to assume that nothing is as it seems. Teddy Daniels walks into a nightmare that slowly builds intensity like the hurricane descending on Shutter Island. His new partner Chuck is a great side kick, but not much help. Then there is the code of 4 that shows up. (Take a minute and puzzle out what is going on here.)<br />Subtle hint, the number 13 has a lot to do with everything, especially Teddy.<br />To discuss the plot is to ruin the plot. This is a masterful job that will have you looking for more.<br />A must read.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is a nice mystery story that has been read by many.  Although many of his \\"clues\\" were a bit too obvious for me, it always helps the reader to know a little more than the characters within the story.  Brown is effective in his writing style with simultaneous streams of action, moving from one story line to another, finally drawing all the story lines together in a \\"surprise\\" ending.  But, he obviously wanted to do more...<br />The premise of Da Vinci Code is related to the current trend in New Testament study of examining other \\"stories\\" of Jesus led by Elaine Pagels and Bart Ehrman.  Non-canonical Gospels (extra-biblical stories of Jesus) are moving to the forefront of biblical studies.  Sure, there are lots of stories of Jesus besides those that exist in the New Testament canon, but what is one to do with them.  It appears that Brown would have us take the non-biblical traditions of a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene and their resulting children as \\"the\\" story of Jesus.  While this is disturbing to many orthodox Christians (as evidenced by the reviews by the defensive, distressed found here), Brown doesn't succeed in overthrowing traditional Christianity.<br />Da Vinci Code argues that the four New Testament Gospels were selected by a group within Christianity that chose to ignore or omit other writings about Jesus and early Christianity.  This is true.  The mere fact that there were other gospels at the time that the New Testament canon does not elevate the value of those non-selected gospels over Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Those who selected the New Testament canon appear to have some criteria besides establishing themselves as the power brokers in the Christian church.  At least one criterion was use by Christians and Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John appear to surpass other gospels in this regard.  Brown would have his reader toss the New Testament in favor of a god-goddess, male-female religion similar to Greco-Roman religions of the first century C.E.  His argument seems to be, the church rejected the Mary Magdalene story and a \\"sexy\\" Christianity, but not everyone did.  Since some continued to practice a fertility Christianity, it must have been the true story of Jesus and those in the New Testament canon were wrong.  Unfortunately, for Brown, the best argument he can make is that a gospel of Mary Magdalene should have a credibility equal to the New Testament gospels.  He does not develop a case for the outright rejection of the New Testament story.<br />Still, Da Vinci Code is a good read and relates well to what will perhaps be the key topic in biblical studies and theology for the next few years.ons of the first century C.E.

B00005JMGL|5.0|Rarely has an adaptation from a classic childhood story been so seamless, visually stunning, and truly entertaining. Originally written as a novel by J.M Barrie in 1904, and then for the London stage soon after, the legend of The Boy Who Never Grew Up entered American mainstream with the 1953 animated Disney version, which, although popular, failed to accurately capture the at times dark subject matter of the original storyline. Now, in 2003, under the guidance of director P.J. Hogan, Peter Pan has been given a live-action cast, the advances of modern filmmaking, and an overall look that is remarkably refreshing to a much wider age range of watchers. <br />Wendy Darling (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is a bright-eyed, and intelligent London girl who delights in telling captivating stories and sword fighting with her two younger brothers John and Michael (Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell, respectively). But, one day, much to Wendy's dismay, her parents and aunt lay down an ultimatum: It has come time for her to grow up, and leave the nursery and her childhood behind. That night, after Mr. and Mrs. Darling leave for a party and the Darling children are all snug in their beds, a magical boy named Peter Pan enters through their open window and with the help of fairy dust and happy thoughts, whisks them away to Neverland, a magical paradise in which you never grow old, and all the characters from Wendy's stories come to life. From adventures with the pirates of the Jolly Roger, commanded by evil Captain Hook, to Indians and fairies, the delightful story comes to life once again on a grand scale. <br />In the terms of performances, most of the young cast are first-time actors, virtual unknowns in the business until now. As Wendy, Rachel Hurd-Wood sparkles, and has an innocense and hidden strength of a heroine around her. As for Peter Pan, (this version is the first to use a boy in the role) the search for the right person spanned nearly three continents, and ended with the find ofJeremy Sumpter (known for his part in the thriller \\"Frailty\\"), who is without a doubt, perfect for the role. With his perfectly tousled hair and devilish good looks, he has a spark of confidence, charm, and a cocky little smile, (and still manages to convey his wish for a mother) that completely captures the character of Peter Pan. Jason Isaacs, who plays both Mr. Darling and Captain Hook (following the stage tradition) is delightful in his range of talent in both characters; Mr. Darling is an awkward, stuttering man who cares deeply and sacrifices much for his family, and Captain Hook is a seductive menace who terrorizes Neverland. In this version, the fairy Tinkerbell is played by French actress Ludivine Sagnier, who is at times annoying, but overall an interesting and amusing approach to the role. <br />One of the things that truly stands out in this Peter Pan is the visual effects and the sets. The Darling household and London itself are beautifully done, and Neverland is beyond words. From the cotton-candy esque clouds above and the dense jungles with the hideout of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, to the menacing ticking crocodile hunting Captain Hook, \\"Peter Pan\\" never ceases to amaze, as well as in the realms of costumes and makeup. <br />Sprinkled with humor, and with a crackling script, a brilliant director, and extremely wise choices in casting, sets and costuming, and visual effects, \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of the best movies of the year and will continue to delight audiences for years to come.
B00000099Y|5.0|I don't usually write album reviews, as I spend more of my time perusing the reviews of albums I have not yet heard to see if they are worth the money. I did, however, drop by Tool's selections to see if any of them received the full 5 star ratings they deserve. As \\"Aenima\\" is my personal favorite, I could not help but be shocked to learn it had a paltry rating of 4.5 stars. Good for most, certianly. Satisfactory for such an incredible, thought-provoking, complex, virtuosity-filled album? Simply put: NO.<BR>Aenima is an album I have listened to so many times, I have almost the entire record learned by heart. Perhaps the best thing to say about it, and Tool themselves, is the sheer amount of skill all of these individual performers possess, and how brilliantly they coalese into one. Danny Carey is perhaps the most skilled drummer of the 90s, even though his talent is most fully exhibited (in my opinion) on the sonic \\"Lateralus\\". One would not be unfulfilled to listen to this album instrument by individual instrument, of course counting Maynard James Keenan's voice as an instrument all its own, and only afterwards listening to the songs as a sum of their parts. The balance is perfect- what Adam Jones's guitar perhaps lacks in virtuousity he makes up in sheer perfection: the parts are unleashed, perhaps more so than played, as the perfect foils to the absolutely jaw dropping rhythms of Carey's impeccable drumwork.<BR>Certainly in a class all his own is my favorite, Maynard James Keenan. Let's face it, this man can SING. Damn, can he sing. Just attempt, in the quiet of your own home, to hold the final \\"Goodbye\\" of Eulogy as long as he can. If you master that, attempt it once more: but at the pitch and volume that he almost effortlessly does. Lyrically, the album is pure poetry. From songs like 46&2, which speak of a desire to approach a more evolved human being, with an extra set of chromosomes to our present 44&2, to Eulogy, a scathing critique of Christianity  lurkingjust behind the obviousness of Opiate (track 6 on \\"Opiate\\"), to allusians to chakras in Third Eye, to \\"shadows shedding skin\\" in H. Yet for every outcry that this album is \\"too dark\\", Tool fire back by naming a crack at all of their elitist, hypocritical fans (sporting \\"OGT\\" tattoes, yet drinking mass marketed and commercialized soda) Hooker, a tongue in cheek way of reminding us that many who wish to be seen one way may, in fact, have something more lurking under the proverbial skirt.<BR>Tool, and Aenima more specifically, are, in the most generic sense of the word, metal, but they truly defy classification. Though meatheads more inclined to push each other around than listen to the music thickly populate Tool concerts, I tend to remind myself that they just don't get it. One can hear Tool's music without ever thinking about what it all means and get upset that some songs are \\"too long\\" (think 14 minutes) and \\"out of place\\" (the catchy interludes that one comes to relish upon devouring the album as a whole), but relish the sheer loudness of pounding, almost anthems like Stinkfist or Aenema (which, with its barrage of profanity and \\"f**king\\" a town that can seem quite like your own after hearing its description), but please, if this is you, move on. You will still enjoy it, but it is difficult to think that this genius album will go so unappreciated in your stereo. Let someone whose life will be changed by it, much as mine has been, purchase your copy.<BR>On this record, Maynard chooses to live, learn, grow, cry, love, and do what it takes to move through, and after experiencing Aenima and what that has to offer, you would be a fool not to let him. Aenima is Maynard's outreached hand: offering itself to you to grow and expand with him. It is your decision to accept it. I have, and after doing so, simply very few bands can suffice anymore. Tool has broken the mold.

6304240554|5.0|An intense and overlooked horror classic, George A. Romero's &quot;Dawn Of The Dead&quot;, the second and most popular in his Dead trilogy, is probably his most epic tale to date. Regarded by many, including Roger Ebert, as the ultimiate definition in horror films, &quot;Dawn&quot; is truly the thinking man's horror movie. Its horror is far more subtle than that of in-your-face suspense films like &quot;Halloween&quot; or &quot;Exorcist&quot; or for that matter, Romero's first Dead film, &quot;Night&quot;. Where most slasher films provide those quick thrills that make us jump but dissapear from our memory almost as quickly as they appeared, &quot;Dawn&quot; creeps into our fears and shows us a view of our downfall as a civilazation.<br />&quot;Dawn&quot; centers around four survivors, two Philadelphia S.W.A.T. members and a couple from a newstation, who are trying to escape a zombie plague that has engulfed the country. The film opens with chaos ensuing as a handful of newscasters attempt unsuccesfully to put together an emergency broadcast. We move forward to a project house where the tenants are protecting the undead because as one of the central characters explains, &quot;They still believe there is honor in being dead&quot;. Guns blaze as seemingly more humans are taken down than actual zombies courtesy of a SWAT team bigit who goes buckwild but ends up getting his before the smoke clears.<br />As the violence in the city seems to be piling up, our four characters use the local news chopper to escape to the country side where the situation isn't any less of a problem though a handful of trigger-happy rednecks seem to be having a great time with their beers and shotguns. After a brief touchdown at said location where the group runs into a few problems with both the zombies and each other while gassing up their helicopter, they head back up into the sky and eventually land at a shopping center, the film's cental location.<br />Placing the story at a mall makes for not only a unique and creative backdrop but also allows for Romero to provide an intriguing social commentary on the madness of consumerism that seemed to sweep the late 70's. The zombies who try to break into the center are portrayed as people who loved shopping there so much in life that all they want to do is be there after death.<br />Romero and make-up effects wizard, Tom Savini are at the most sadistic during the concluding act of this film as our heroes do battle with another band of survivors, a motorcycle gang who shows up and tries to take over the mall for themselves. The zombies, who prior to this were pretty much an afterthought regain their power because their human counterparts are far too busy with each other to notice that they are regaining control of the place. Savini's graphic make-up effects really make for a great finale.<br />&quot;Dawn Of The Dead&quot; is very much a different film from &quot;Night Of The Living Dead&quot;. &quot;Dawn&quot; takes a far different approach to the &quot;dead taking over the world&quot; concept that George helped create in &quot;Night&quot;. The mall setting is far less clostrophobic than the farmhouse in the original but it is the nightmare outside that our characters must deal with. In &quot;Night&quot;, it was all about getting past the problem that lie in front of them and it's smooth sailing. In &quot;Dawn&quot;, the problem is almost reversed. They are safe inside their location, though their safety is an illusion, and it is the outside world that is coming in. They don't want to get away. The outside world is falling apart and the mall is almost a false symbol of protection.<br />&quot;Dawn&quot; probably will not be an instant overnight favorite. I, myself, was expecting a much different movie than the one I watched. Having caughts bits and pieces of &quot;Day&quot; before I actually sat down to watch it, I was expecting it to have more of the look and feel that I associated with that movie. I honestlydidn't know what to make of the weird clothing, the Smurf-blue make-up effects, and the strange Goblins music that popped up through out the film. Within two weeks of watching it, it had become one of my favorite films. All these weird visuals that I found strange actually kept dragging me in over and over again. Though the film is over 25 years old, I can still honestly say that there are very few films of any genre that resemble it.estly didn't know what to make of the weird clothing, the Smurf-blue make-up effects, and the strange Goblins music that popped up through out the film.

The author has a fantastic sense of humour, and if you only read the chapter on Noahs Ark, you're in for a real treat. Other chapters are a little more hardgoing, but its worth it. Barnes takes myths, stories, paintings and so on as his inspiration and builds on them, adding a really human element to things which are otherwise hard to imagine.<br />It makes you think, but not in an overly challenging way!

B00005JMGL|5.0|the new movie Peter Pan was a brilliant film, P.J Hogan (the director) couldn't have chosen a better cast, although, Rachel Wood (Wendy), wasn't all that convincing, especially compaired to Jeremy Sumpton (Peter), a better Wendy would've been Sarena Sanghera from Briton (UK). Sarena hasn't been in many movies yet but is certainly destened for stardom.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly the show didn't hook me right at 1st. I had to get over the western cowboyish thing. I remember watching it and thinking &quot;This isn't at all like star trek?&quot; Meaning this isn't the type of sci-fi I had grown use to. What can I say to much politically correct Star Trek had made me think the future was sterile, and had problems with time travel continuity oh and alternate universes.<br />The draw of this series for me more than anything else is the character interaction. They had a vibe that just drew me in. The only reason I could see not to get this box set is because when it's over it's like getting halfway into a good book and then reality hits you and you never get to finish that book. The not knowing where it was going grates on me.

B0000067L2|4.0|This is an overrated album.  Everyone says that it's better than the debut, FRESH CREAM.  Well guess what?  They're wrong!  FRESH CREAM was better, and it's version of &quot;Rollin' And Tumblin'&quot; totally blows away anything on this album.<BR>Notwithstanding, DISRAELI GEARS is still a fascinating blend of &quot;psychedelic blues rock&quot;, which may have been the most ubiquitous type of music at the time.<BR>&quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; (with that sensational riff) and &quot;Tales Of Brave Ulysses&quot; (featuring the first ever wah-wah pedal performance) are the radio classics, and all three are great songs.  But there are better songs on here, like &quot;Take It Back&quot; for example.  I mean, the intro ALONE is stunning, with Eric's guitar and Jack's bass pounding away like a musical sledgehammer.  Jack also gets in some wonderful harmonica too.  &quot;World Of Pain&quot; is also an overlooked gem, and lyrically, it's probably the best song the band ever came up with (those lyrics are so very, very poetic).  And check out the tone of Clapton's guitar on this song, too.  Awesome or what?!<BR>&quot;Dance The Night Away&quot; and &quot;We're Going Wrong&quot; are the only bad songs on here, and provide audible proof that ballads were definitely NOT the band's forte.  However, I think that Baker's &quot;Blue Condition&quot; is excellent.  I wouldn't call his voice 'outstanding' or anything, but it's definitely unique and intriguing.  &quot;SWLABR&quot; is one of the band's best rockers ever (incidentally, it stands for 'She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow').  And Clapton responds to Bruce's vocals with some painful guitar howls.  Even better is the sizzling blues tune &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot;, with a spectacular riff and some great double-tracked guitar playing from Slowhand.  And of course, &quot;Mother's Lament&quot; is a total goof.  It's good for a laugh, but that's about it.

I was hoping and expecting this to be a B-grade hilarious clunker. It's far from it.

She articulately and powerfully belts them out, some with the added inspirational power of a gospel choir backing her up.<br /><br />This soundtrack will raise your spirits high.

So when Errol Flynn's Robin Hood finally came out in DVD, I knew I had to get it. I was afraid, like other old movies and TV sitcoms, that the passage of time would not be gentle to Robin Hood. But the movie is a good as ever. Adding the cartoons is also a nice touch in the DVD extra.

0385512104|5.0|2.  I belong to a book club in my neighborhood. When it's<br />your turn to be the host, you get to pick the book everyone<br />will read.  Last year I picked The Gospel According to Jesus<br />Christ by Jose Saramago.  The year before that I picked If on<br />a Winter's Night a Traveler by Italo Calvino.  The year before<br />that I picked Mason &amp; Dixon by Thomas Pynchon.  I could keep<br />going with this list, but Siobhan would say that people<br />wouldn't want to read a list of all of the books I have picked<br />for book club and I could put it in an appendix, but reviews<br />don't have appendices, so I will just stop the list after the<br />first three books.<br />3.  Up until December 9, 2003 I was going to pick Pride and<br />Predudice by Jane Austen for my next book club book because it<br />was the first &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; that I ever<br />read and I was blown away by it even though I thought it was<br />going to be dull and boring.  But then I changed my mind.  Now<br />I am going to pick The Curious Incident of the Dog in the<br />Night-Time by Mark Haddon because I like it more than anything<br />I have read since some of the other books I have picked for<br />book club.  Since I don't know you and I don't know what you<br />like to read, I don't know whether you will like it or not.<br />5.  Christopher would have been confused by my statement that<br />I was blown away by Pride and Prejudice, since blown away is a<br />metaphor.  Christopher says that metaphors should really be<br />called lies because I am still here and I was not blown away<br />by either the wind or some great explosion or anything else.<br />If I had said instead that reading Pride and Predudice made me<br />feel like I did after watching Clueless with Alicia<br />Silverstone, Christopher would not have been confused because<br />this is a simile rather than a metaphor and he says that a<br />simile is not a lie unless it is a bad simile.<br />7.  I'm not autistic, so I have no idea if this book is a lie<br />or not.  I hope it is not because if I were autistic I would<br />like to be like Christopher and solve mysteries and have<br />adventures like he does.<br />11.  Here are a few of the reasons I like The Curious Incident<br />of the Dog in the Night-Time.  For the same reason that I cut<br />my list of books short in chapter 2, I will not list all of my<br />reasons in this one.<br />  a. Christopher uses logic and intellect and courage to<br />solve mysteries and find his way in a confusing and sometimes<br />overwhelming world.<br />  b. Christopher's favorite detective is Sherlock Holmes<br />and he knows the difference between a real clue and a Red<br />Herring.<br />  c. I laughed and almost cried and was thoroughly amazed<br />by the creativity of Mark Haddon's writing.<br />  d. I learned how to find a landmark in a strange city by<br />walking in an outward spiral.<br />  e. I learned how to prove that a traingle with sides that<br />can be written in the form n-squared + 1, n-squared -1, and 2n<br />(where n &gt; 1) is right angled, even if I did have to read the<br />appendix.<br />13.  Everything I have written in this review is true.I have no idea if this book is a lie <BR>or not.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Did I miss something?  To read the other reviews offered, it would seem DT took a step back to their &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; period.  I thought this album was terrific from start to finish.  I walked around humming &quot;In The Name Of God&quot; for about ten minutes after it had concluded.  But perhaps there's a lesson here:  if you're expecting Metropolis Part 3 or 6 More Degrees Of Inner Turbulence, prepare for a letdown.  The band has moved on.  One quibble, however:  what's up with that cover, guys?
B00005LQ04|5.0|The only thing scarier than the first ninety minutes of this movie are the last ten! Suspiria is a film that I have been holding back on for some time now. The first reason is that I believed it could not live up to the hype. The second is that I have been recently disappointed by some of Dario Argento's latest works. I picked up the guts to go and watch it and this movie was sheer hell for me from start to finish. I was behind the sofa for most of it, howling. I am a grown man and I screamed and screamed! Grown men are not supposed to do that now are they?<br />Suspiria looks stunning and is only second best in terms of look to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond which has much better camerawork - however the set design, color and use of lighting in Suspiria are world class achievements in cinematography and motion picture strategy. The premise is a simple one. Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American ballerina who heads to Germany to attend dance school. When she gets there she witnesses another girl running away from the school and overhears her saying something in the process. These words are important and she remembers them later in the last moments of the film. The running girl ends up staying in her friend's house and both are murdered in what has to be the most visually brutal slaughter yet committed to celluloid. That sequence alone is worth the ticket here. Back in the school more murders take place and Bannion tries to figure out what is the mystery behind the school and the deaths that are occurring there. At its bible sized hole in the heart, Suspiria is a murder mystery and you are left guessing as to what is what and who is who. There are several very scary sequences in this film and Argento manages to pull off a stunt with a blind man and his guide dog that right comes out of the blue. This film was non-stop horror entertainment from start to finish with a whooping ending to boot. My God what a finish! That was a sheer nerve-wrecking experience.<br />The whole film is one big payoff. The music is dead-on, one hundred percent accurate for this type of movie (and you can be damn sure that there is only ONE movie of this type!). It plays itself out like some kind of kid's fairytale-come-nightmare. Suspiria almost seems like a Tim Burton movie that is instead in the hands of raving sadistic maniac who knows how to make you jump and soil your pants twenty times over. If you watch this film with other people you will hear plenty word's around you to the gist of - \\"My God, I've just had ANOTHER accident.\\"<br />Suspiria is NOT a gore / splatter fest like most of the other works from Argento. Yes, Suspiria does have gore and plenty of blood, but this movie is damn near the scariest films I have ever witnessed and I have seen literally hundreds in this genre.<br />This is a perfect horror film to \\"susperience!\\"whole film is one big payoff.

0446530891|3.0|I relied upon the reviews posted after I started the book.  By the way the reviews on Amazon written by readers are better in my view than most one reads by professionals.  I agree that the book is a great page turner in the beginning because the premise is terrific.  The problem is that there is not a satisfying or believable resolution.  The other disappointment is that Baldacci at his best develops memorable characters such as in Absolute Control or the Winner.  In this book none of the characters grew or surprised.  <BR>If you have not read Baldacci before do not start with this one.  If you have read his others prepare for having fun but the book will not measure up.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is one of those few movies that is better than the original and pretty much tops the horror/sci-fi list. What most people forget is that Aliens is downright scary and probably one of the most frightening films ever made. Aliens has all the elements that you would expect for a genre like this one and then some others that you would not. It also has several great action set pieces to boot all hammered around within some impressive nerve-wrecking suspense conjured up its legendary director - James Cameron.<br />The premise for this movie is set 75 years after the original. Warrant Officer Ripley who did battle with the first alien wakes up from deep space hibernation after being recovered from her space pod. She discovers that the planet she once visited which contained the alien is now home to some sort of human colony. When contact is lost with the outpost Ripley goes back to her nightmare world with a gang of heavy armour reinforced grunts to discover what has happened there. The rest is cinema history.<br />Go see the most scariest action film of all time. The DVD transfer makes this epic look nothing short of stunning. What a ride! What a rush!
0694526088|5.0|I first heard about the book when I was reading an article detailing a Microsoft executive's visit to China. The book was recommended to those aspiring college students eagerly seeking secrets to success. I would be lying if I said this book is a cure-all.But it definitely provides a insightful look into several key questions concerning the achievement of greatness by a company. Whereaz this book treat the readers mainly as the top management, it is a good read to anyone who is interested getting to know more about the experiments, successful or failed, that have been carried out that trace back to decades. The book is an eye opener to me and I believe it would be for you too. It is exemplary of what a business book should be.
B00002E233|5.0|Comparing this movie to Jaws is just plain dumb. If Jaws is the ultimate shark movie then does this mean that Hollywood should never produce another shark movie again? Renny Harlin has delivered on all the goods right here in this B-movie that never tries to be more than what it is - a scary movie about killer sharks. DBS kicks the blubber out of ALL the Jaws sequels and it certainly eats up all the other direct-to-video shark attack movies. It can easily take second place on the shark movie list which is not a bad thing considering that Jaws is rated as one of the best movies ever out of all the genre types.<br />This is a great action flick with lots of stunning set pieces to boot. The whole film takes place on a deep-sea rig that is a marine institution for sharks that are being biologically altered to produce medicine. Then all hell breaks loose and the genetically modified sharks start eating everybody up. The end action sequence is mind-blowing and the special effects are top notch.<br />In short - if you are going to see a shark attack movie then watch Jaws, but if you want to see another then this is the one to get, hands down. The suspense is great and the film moves forward at quite a fast pace. There is never a dull moment to be had in DBS and you should all be thankful that someone had the courage to go out and make a competitive shark attack movie like this one (not to mention that Hollywood found a new leading action man in Thomas Jane.)<br />Great stuff and a thoroughly enjoyable monster movie.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I over estimated this album just a little. I was hoping it was going to be the same transition as Christina Aguilera's transition in \\"Stipped\\". When I first heard the album all of the songs sounded the same. Once I listened to it a little more I found that there were some good songs. This is how I rate them:<br />1. Me Against the Music feat. Madonna.- 7/10. I have to admit it is a very catchy tune. This is what made me decide to purchase the album. A great dance song.<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom (featuring Ying Yang Twins)- 2/10. I can not stand this song. This is the worst song on the album. The Ying Yang Twins and Britney Spears do not mix together.<br />3. Showdown- 6/10. I like the beat. It is kind of sultry. It makes you want to dance real sexy and just be \\"dirty\\". Good song.<br />4. Breathe On Me- 9/10. This is a song you would hear at Express. This is one of my favorite songs on this album. This song just makes you move if you know it or not.<br />5. Early Mornin'- 4/10. It sounds like showdown. It doesn't do much for me though. It is just a normal song and that's about it.<br />6. Toxic- 10/10. My favorite song on the album. I love the way the beat changes for the chorus. fun beat and great to just cruise the car in.<br />7. Outrageous- 6/10- I liked it but I overplayed it so I guess that means that it is an alright song if I can't listen to it anymore. Different song but it is good.<br />8. Touch of My Hand- 7/10. Because this is about masterbation! It sounds like a Madonna song. I didn't realize what it was about until I heard the words. I like the beat of it though and the way her voice goes so well with the song.<br />9. The Hook Up- 9/10- I want her to release this song next because the mood of the song is so upbeat! This is a good club song. You could dance so dirty to it too.<br />10. Shadow- 5/10. I was suprised that she has only two ballads on this album. I am happy for it. This song is so much like her \\"Oops\\" days. It is ok. a bubble gum balladsong.<br />11. Brave New Girl- 9/10. I really like this song. Although it sounds nothing like Britney Spears. It is a bubble gum song too but there is just something about it that is catchy.<br />12. Everytime- 7/10. I just don't like the way she sings when it is a slow song and she has to elaberate on her voice. She isn't a Christina Aguilera. Pretty words though.<br />13. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna) Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix- 8/10. Club song.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the Zone is probably my favorite Britney album ever. The production is just excellent and varied, and the songs are very catchy. My favorite songs are Toxic, Breathe On Me, and Brave New Girl. Britney has come a long way to become a phenomenon, and this album shows that she can reinvent herself and be able to make great music.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is just an all-around good album. You can listen to it straight through, without skipping a track. You'll be suprised how many of these songs you have heard on the radio or TV...and the best thing is that they have not been overplayed to death. I was hesitant to buy this album and got it for X-Mas by surprise, and I wish I had bought it much much earlier. This album is so much better than any of that rap/hiphop junk. Enjoy A Rush of Blood to the Head by Coldplay!
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I have enjoyed Sarah McLachlan's other title's tremendously, playing them over and over even to this day.  After hearing the first track on the radio (and liking it) I anxiously awaited to hear this new album and was completely disappointed.  I thought the songs were too slow and boring.  Usually, her music is more varied, but this was just all the same thing over and over.
0316666343|3.0|Not something I would have normally read, but an interesting story all the same. The perspective is somewhat unique (which is why I picked up the book in the first place), a teenager in her own self-made Heaven. Several of the supporting characters seem two-dimensional; the detective is simply obtuse and dealing with his own emotional issues acts in a manner which is degrading to the profession. And the 'miracle' at the end, oh good grief. I think the idea is to create a sympathetic audience, and while it took a mere few hours to read, my only sympathy is for the person who wastes more time on it.
B0000E5NPZ|4.0|Jean Seabourg and David Niven co-star in this stylish uncoming-of-age drama about a carefree, swinging widower and his equally irresponsible daughter, Cecile, a cynical teenage flirt who acts as the film's narrator.  They are on vacation on the French Riviera, along with Elke, an adorable, airheaded European party girl who is there as dad's date and Cecile's playmate, right up until she gets dumped in favor of a hotter prospect.  Cecile thinks the new gal will be just another one of Dad's little conquests, the ones they laugh about between chic parties and social calls, but when the new relationship turns serious, with Niven about to settle down with a mature-minded woman who may force Cecile to take her own actions seriously, the girl rebels and determines to undo the tryst.  In some ways, the plot seems somewhat simple and uneventful, although this seeming flatness is actually a reflection of the shallowness of the character's emotional lives.  Directed by Otto Preminger, this flick is packed with stylish cinematography and equally chic clothes, arch dialogue and great on-location scenery... It may not be a real classic, or a soul-moving work of art, but it is quite entertaining and very nice to watch.
B00005QZ82|4.0|In my never ending endeavor to evaluate all the adorable movie stars (I'm sorry, I can't help myself) I've seen yet another Meg Ryan movie and I must say I'm beginning to be smitten.  She is just so darn cute.  And ageless.  And perky.  And actually a wee bit sexy when she gets in the right mood.  And anyway since the movie takes place mostly in France (the stomping ground of my partially misspent youth) the scenery is nostalgic, the title is cute, and believe me, the food is delicious.<br />But what carries this movie is a beguiling performance by Kevin Kline and his very oo, la, la French accent.  I also liked the concierge who takes Meg's 100-Franc note (worth about twenty bucks) as his God-given concierge right with nothing more than a belated, merci you vile American touriste.<br />Okay, I have to confess.  I have a love/hate relationship with Meg.  I just want to take her home and tuck her into bed, but all she cares about is being cute on screen and teasing me.<br />Director Lawrence Kasdan (Body Heat 1981, Anne Tyler's The Accidental Tourist 1989, writing credits with George Lucas sagas, etc.) has a few jokes with the nearly all female theater audience and their drag-along beaux.  (Actually this video is currently being viewed on the couch across the nation by Roseanne Barr and John Goodman look-alikes with Roseanne making sarcastic remarks about Meg's eyeshadow and scrawny physique while Goodman chortles with squinty eyes as he anticipates the action to come apr&egrave;s le flick.)  I especially liked the vast vineyard (Meg is drooling) that Kevin DOES NOT HAVE due to his wild and crazy ways (he says, but shows it to her anyway).  I mean, RESOURCES are what a real woman wants in a man, dodo brain.  What are you doing, playing hard to get?<br />Anyway, as all romance movie fans know, boy meets girl (cute), boy and girl cannot get it on just yet for 1001 wacky reasons, and finally boy gets girl or actually girl gets boy, and boy turns out to be worth getting as he naturally comes up with beaucoup des ressources of a very special kind.  Etc.<br />See this for Kevin Kline, an underrated actor who has a lot of fun behind the five o'clock shadows and the French pastry while proving he can Can Can with the best of them.naturally comes up with beaucoup des ressources of a very special kind.

B00005JMGC|3.0|Well you have to like the vulnerability that Julie Roberts brings to this film. She definately lights up the screen and always mananges to pull off a struggling character.  Stiles role<br />is really well developed in light of the twist they put on her decision, and probably the best script writing in the film was in this scene.  They didn't make the message trite which I appreciated.<br />It was definately a jab at upper society forcing women into set roles which needs to be discussed as well.  They dropped Julia's romance though in a way that just seemed a little too male bashing.  Unfortunately most films that try to deal with the plight of women don't avoid male bashing and this one was no exception.  It did a great job capturing the trouble a teacher faces in winning over an arrogant and jaded audience.  Overall a nice warm fuzzy film, but not a life-changer.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was never ever a fan of Christina Aguilera. I had judged her on the *pop culture* of her previous hits, Genie In A Bottle..etc. I had totally overlooked her talent, which nobody, not even Kelly Osbourne (who hates the chick) could deny. I heard Dirrty and I loved it instantly, it had a very urban, RnB feel to it. I rushed out to the store to buy the single and found that it cost 4.99. For 9.99 I could have the album, so I figured I'd go out on a limb and buy it. I was not disappointed. I'll give you a track by track rundown. <BR>1. Stripped Intro : This is just the intro to the album, but it's really good. It's a perfect opener to the CD in which Christina finally gets to tell her side of things.<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down: This is a great hip hop track with a rap by Lil Kim. The beats are flawless, the lyrics are clever and flow well. The song is based around female empowerment, it has a great message. 9/10<BR>3. Walk Away: My favourite track from the album. It's a long, soulful ballad about escaping heartache. It show cases Christina's talent perfectly. Her voice displays the emotion of the track so well. 10/10<BR>4. Fighter: This is a rock track. Great guitar rift, excellent vocal performance, cram packed with attitude. Another of my favourite tracks. 10/10<BR>5. Primer Amore Interlude: Not a song, an interlude. Christina speaks in Spanish of her lover. A good introduction to the next track.<BR>6. Infatuation: A latin track with a good beat. The song has cool lyrics and flows well. Another flawless vocal from Ms Aguilera. A great track. 10/10<BR>7. Lovers Embrace Interlude: Another interlude, Christina just hums and says a few words about her lover. Really, it could have been included with the next track.<BR>8. Loving Me 4 Me: A calm ballad. Lovely lyrics, a smooth vocal and a good beat. Another of my favourite tracks. Memorable. 10/10<BR>9. Impossible: My least favourite track from the album, but by no means bad. Alicia Keys wrote this and it shows. Soulful, but not really Christina's style. Great lyrics and a good vocal though. 8/10<BR>10. Underappreciated: More of a pop tune. Catchy beat, yet another flawless vocal performance from Christina. A more up-tempo track. 9/10<BR>11. Beautiful: A truely beautiful ballad with a lovely, positive, uplifting message. Penned by Linda Perry, a smash hit, with a lovely vocal and excellent lyrics. <BR>12. Make Over: A rock influenced track. I don't think this kind of track really compliments Christina's voice. She uses bullsh*t a lot, packed with attitude. 8/10<BR>13. Cruz: Another more poppy track. An upbeat ballad with nice lyrics. Not particularly memorable to me, another of my least favourites, but by no means bad. 8/10<BR>14. Soar: I love this track. It has a sort of Beautiful message behind it, but Christina wrote it itself and puts in a great vocal performance. Did you hear the note she hit at the end?? 10/10<BR>15. Get Mine, Get Yours: An RnB track. This has to be my second favourite on the album. Kinky, sexy, riske, a great song. Cool beats, excellent rhyming technique with the hook. 10/10<BR>16. Dirrty: This track is a definate party tune, that addicted me instantly. Redman puts in a great rap, good hip hop beat and catchy hook. 10/10<BR>17. Stripped Part 2: Not really long enough to be a proper track. Great vocal performance. <BR>18. The Voice Within: An inspirational ballad. Great vocal, beautiful lyrics and an artistic video. Another favourite of mine. 10/10<BR>19. I'm Okay: I refuse to review this track because it is so personal to Christina, and I feel I don't have the right as a fan to judge it. Very emotional. <BR>20: I'm Okay: A great end to the album. Did you hear how long she held that note at te end for?? That's gotta be a record. Kinda a gospel feel to this last track. 10/10<BR>With the exception of two tracks, Christina co-wrote this entire album. She is incredibly talented, putting a lot of emotion into each track and providing an excelltn vocal performance.I highly recommende this to any music fan because there is something for everybody. She certainly proved herself in my eyes, which admittedly isn't that easy. 10/10
B00003CXDZ|3.0|Ok, I admit I loved the ending. It gave me what I wanted in terms of romance. Again, Hollywood gave me a film that was just a remake of a very overdone plot. Basically, it failed to pull me into the pathos of the film. I am supposed to feel sorry for this girl who is willing to throw herself into bed for this man to bankroll her show.  Of course there were a few original duets that were stunning--the highlight being the clear tenor voice of the hero.  But the villian was way too overdone.  I didn't believe him at all. Way two dimensional. Its too bad the writers didn't try to work on some original dialogue instead of making everything some allusion.  But if you can live with a lot of silly remakes of songs like Roxanne and some great sets, with a few beautiful moments thrown in, it will work for you. Its parts were basically greater than the whole which is too bad. Nicole is stunning in it, but her acting didn't give the character any more realness than the script did. I hate to say it, but its a musical non-musicians love.
0345451325|4.0|My expectation for this book wasn't that high, considering the massive amounts of other B-grade books on the similar topic. But instead of the expected stereotyping, this book was in a class of its own.<BR>  The author, Eric Nylund, did an impressive job of painting the story in the readers' mind, descriptions weren't repeated, and so on.<BR>  The story was based on the much acclaimed x-box game, Halo, this being the official prequel with two other books in the series. The story is set approximately in the year of 2552, where humans had colonized other systems, and is under serious threat from a mixture of aliens called the 'Covenant' and is on the verge of being defeated, meaning, extinct, as the brutal Covenant doesn't take prisoners. <BR>  The plot revolves around a group of &quot;super soldiers&quot;, mostly focusing on the leader of the group, Spartan- 117, or more well known as the Master chief. They were, as the book states, &quot;bred for combat&quot; and were immensely strong and agile. Bolstered by their MJOLNIR battle armor, they were the saviors in many battles. They had won on every mission, though for every minor victory on land, the space fleet lost two major ones, as the Covenant weapons technology was immensely superior to that of the humans.<BR>  Anyway, their last mission in the book was to capture a covenant ship, and use it to find out the location of their home world. This was abandoned because of a huge Covenant invasion on the military installation of Reach. As the title of the book implied, the seemingly invincible fortress fell, because of a planet side assault. The whole Spartan company was slaughtered except for the Master chief. The book closes with the flight of a cruiser containing the Master chief, escaping the wrath of the Covenant forces.<BR>  Beautifully written and narrated, this book is a treat for all.
B00003CX5P|4.0|When Episode One came out I saw it the first day.  So I do like Star Wars, and expected a great movie.  Many others have complained about various aspects of this movie.  There is plenty about episode one that is definitely different from the original three.  Many reviewers have commented on how bad they thought the film was.  But my review is not going to focus on the complaints.  Here are the good things:<br /><br />DVD quality -- This DVD has unimpeachable quality.  Picture, sound and features.  It has lots of extras.  It is a very well done DVD!  Trailers, TV Spots, Deleted Scenes, documentaries.  Bravo!  The menu is interesting/entertaining and there is a lot of material.  The commentary adds a lot of bits and pieces to the Star Wars Lore.  You won't be disappointed with the bonus material.<br /><br />The Music:  Williams familiar Star Wars score is on target again, and the choral parts in Episode One really highlight the danger of the Sith Lord Maul when he makes a wordless dramatic entrance.  The music is great, and almost serves as part of the story.  In fact Lucas speaks of the music in the commentary.<br /><br />The Origin of Star Wars:  Complaints notwithstanding, this film introduces us to the Galaxy far far away, to the Galactic Senate, the Jedi Council, new worlds like Coruscant, Naboo, Tattoinne, and sets the framework for the whole Star Wars epic.  For all those who complain about EP 1 - the story has to begin somewhere, and Lucas fills us in all these things.  The story begins to show who Luke and Leia's parents are, what the deal is with Jedi, Yoda, Obiwan and dark Jedi.  We even get introduced to some central characters of later films -- Artoo and Threepio.  And most importantly, we see Anakin, whose descent into the dark coincides with the rising of the empire.  What causes Anakin to turn to the Dark Side?  Episode 1 sets the stage to answer this question in a Galaxy not so different from our own, with Aliens, Starships, Bureaucracy, Conquests, Honor, Intrigue, Evil, and Brave Protectors, both Jedi and other heros.  There are still some gaps and gaffes -- the notion that Anakin was miraculously conceived and the whole talk of midiclorians as the source of the Force seem improbable or weak.  But the story does provide a beginning.<br /><br />Effects:  It looks awesome!  You may have trouble taking it all in, and should watch the film a couple of times.  Each time you can notice additional details.  The cutting edge effects in Ep 1 are now seen in other big films like LOTR and Marvel's offerings (Hulk, DD, Spidey, Xmen).  Another point --> People hated Jar Jar.  The fact that you can dislike a CGI character speaks volumes of the skill of the creators.  Also the scenery was brilliant.  Naboo and Coruscant especially are just beautiful.  Tell me another film that lets you visit worlds such as them?  Underwater Gungan City?  Awesome.  Locations too were gorgeous, and a large part of the story, just like the music.<br /><br />Lightsaber Battles:  Remember the scene where Maul stands in the hangar door.  He says nothing and yet effectively screams \\"I AM OPENING A BIG CAN OF WHOOP*SS ON YOU BOTH!\\"  That is an awesome scene.  Prior to this, we had never seen such a saber battle.  Not Errol Flynn, the Musketeers or the best Chinese Masters had shown us such a duel - ferocity, talent and effects.  The CGI, stunts, acrobatics, scenery, music, and tempo are awesome.  And when the laser field prevents the chase from continuing, the look of hate on Maul's face and the calm of the Jedi Master is excellent.  It really shows the fury and peace of light and dark.  Many have derided this movie, but this climatic scene is an outstanding piece.  Episode One's battle between the Jedi and Sith Lord is better than any lightsaber duels previously seen.  EP II's massive Jedi battle is likewise exceptional, but less personally intense than the duel between Qui Gon, Maul and Obiwan.  Ep III's jedi battles improve upon this.<br /><br />The Pod Race:  Spectacular Action on Epic Scale.  The DVD has deleted scenes of the race with optional commentary which make it a little clearer that the race is really 3 laps long and shows some extra footage.  The Pod Race is like the Superbowl of the Lucas Galaxy, so why shouldn't it be grand, action-filled and intense?  It is.<br /><br />The very end of the movie:  As the credits end, you can hear Darth Vader-ish wheezing.  Did you listen for it?  Haunting. . .<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed these things about this DVD too.  There's been too much complaining.<br /> <br />The Pod Race:  Spectacular Action on Epic Scale.

0446530891|2.0|This was certainly not Baldacci's best work.  Being a huge fan of his, I had high hopes for his newest thriller, but it was a let down from the first page.  I had to force myself through the whole book, only to find out that the ending was supremely canned.  The story line did not grab me despite this being my favorite genere.  In fact, I read the whole book feeling as if I had read it before - there was nothing original or interesting about the plot or characters and it left me wishing I had picked up something else instead.  I can only hope that this is his only low point in his writing, because ordinarily his books are real page turners.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead further their electronic experimentation with this classic gem, Kid A. Never before has a band tryed a different take on things, and hit the mark so genuinely. Beautiful album from start to finish. 5 stars. :-D

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Someone should have banned this cd... it is the worst CD I have heard.  A mix of rap and slut in a tight leather outfit - Britney has outdone the definition of \\"bad.\\"  The songs are a mixture of different styles and her voice does justice to none of them.  The words are trite and lack any form of worthiness.<BR>     I have a very extensive collection of CD's, but this one will NOT be one, and I have serious doubts that any future attempts by her will be added.  Most famous artist enter a \\"slut\\" phase but the really good ones get back out of it.  Let us hope Britney wakes up and manages to realize she has a decent voice before she ends up singing in third rate bars with a cover charge and a pole.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I have 2 words to describe this album and this group:BEYOND GREAT! This album is one of the most influental(however you spell it) progressive rock/greatness bands around right now. The only great album by At The Drive-In(the band before Mas Volta) was Relationship of Command. I just love this album. If you love this band, look for bands such as: At The Drive-In,Radiohead,Minisrty,Nine Inch Nails,and Pink Floyd.Pick up this album. Listen to it a few times (let it sink in) then it will be one of the only albums you will be listening to for a while.
B00001PE4D|3.0|Cruel intentions is one of those movies that would appeal to the yonger generation. however the story isnt just about a sex scandal. it has a strange way of showing it but its based around love. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a bet with her step brother(Phillipie) that if he can manage to lose Resse Witherspoons virginity. She would make love to him. The story is good and the confrantations of Sex, lies, Betrayal all come into this rather average film. Some people see this as a sex flick but that would only really be from the mouths of 10-16 year olds. Good to watch at least once but after that its not worth seeing again. Buy it if you have to but make your own decision if you have seen it
B000002BQK|5.0|This is another amazing album and a must have. It is touching and fun album. Nothing else she has done is like this. This album also includes wonderful signing and touching lyrics.
B0000399WI|5.0|When Andy Dufrain (Tim Robbins?) finds his wife cheating on him he finds himself drunk and ready to kill her and her lover. But his last bit of common sense stops him and he throws the gun in a river. Unfortunately for him on that same night, the murder he intended was commited by someone else. Andy is the prime suspect and is sentenced to two life terms, back to back in Shawshank Prison.<br />Andy finds himself in a cold hard world with nothing but time. Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man that can get you things. Cigarettes, posters, whatever you want he can smuggle it in. Andy approaches Red in search of a rock hammer, the two become friends instantly.<br />Because of Andy's innocence he is restless in prison, being a smart man he always tries to find a way to make his life better.<br />The Shawshank Redemption shows the life of a prison and what the prisoners do to pass time. This is a powerfull film showing the dependence that some people show ti Shawshank, and the defiance of others.
B0000028VT|5.0|I am a devoted Mariah fan, and this has to be one of her best. it is full of emotion and beautiful singing. It is a mix of touching songs such as &quot;Hero&quot; &quot;Without You&quot; and great dance music. It has ten tracks which make it easy to take it all in, in one sitting. Any Mariah fan should have it. It is nice because it is simple and not trying to hard.
B00008PW2D|5.0|I have watched every single episode and this is by far my favorite season.  It was a very honest portrayal of being single and dealing with relationships.  Obviously some people can't handle the reality of it and have to insult it, but if these people spent any time living single in a cosmopolitan, big city like New York they would realize that these situations actually happen and the dialogue was genuine and honest.  Maybe Samantha isn't the most developed character, but I do know some people a lot like her.  I think most of these reviews are pissed off about the fact that they only got 2 DVD's instead of the usual 3.  I say quality over quantity.   Maybe if you can't relate, you won't like it.  I certainly could relate, and thought it was very powerful and moving.  Can't wait for season 6.
0671891634|1.0|The only lesson I learnt and agreed with this book is to diversify your investment.  And THAT! is what the entire world already knew about the investment long time ago.  It is so easy to say in the book, but in a reality, I don't think average investors could follow Lynch's advice.  How could you call your target company and ask for the update or (even funnier) call up so-called CEO.  Mr. Lynch could do that easily because he was a fund manager.  And most fund managers are welcomed by all listed companies (if not, they still have to accept the visit request).  The book is perhaps best (well let's put a big ?) used in the States.  But most of his guidances will definitely not work in emerging markets like China, Thailand, etc.  Why?  if you look at listed companies in these countries, you would find out that their dividend payout history is entirely different story from what Lynch has said in the book.  And if you have read a real valuation book, you'll find out that this book is so watery.  I totally agree that the capital gain from equity is far more greater than those recevied from the Bond's.  But you need to be careful of putting your fund entirely in this market.  Huge gain comes with enormous risk.  This is why most of the valuation and investment books mention risk in their beginning chapters.  I have witnessed many times that huge capital gains do not necessarily associate with good solid companies.  As you know most of the investors are speculators.  Think about of what Lynch's advices in his book.  And buy a real investment / valuation book and compare (i.e., Damodaran's).  You will know exactly of what I mean.

B000075BFK|5.0|2Pac only went and let out another 5 star classic release with this breathe taking album. 'Tha row' must of cashed in a few bob with this stunner. I personally think that 'tha row' shouldnt have anything to do with 2pac . I mean Sugh Knight was the one that set 2pac up anyway. If it was'nt for him pac would still be here today giving us hip hop fans the inspiration we need. Anyway the album is another 2pac classic going down in history so i really do advice that you cop this disk before you forget and if that happens believe me you will regret it, and i aint just saying that ,what with being a pac fan, it really is a 5 star classic.
0609610570|5.0|The book's primary focus is the importance of getting the right people in the right jobs to manage the three core business processes of people, strategy, and operations.<BR>As a CEO, Larry Bossidy freely admits, \\"The leader's most important job is selecting and appraising people.\\"  With the right people in the right jobs, there's a gene pool of leadership that creates strategies that can be executed (when strategies are in sync with the realities of the marketplace, the economy, and the competition, they're much more likely to be executed and produce great results).<BR>Bottom-line for this book:  It will help crystallize and confirm many of the worries and suspicions you have in the back of your mind, and give you something to do about it.  Definitely a book to have if you are in a leadership position.  As a senior sales leader for a large pharmaceutical company, I have three personal favorites in my library:<br />1.) Good to Great by Jim Collins<BR>2.) The Power of Habit by Jack D. Hodge<BR>3.) The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick M. Lencioni<br />Now I'm adding a fourth: Execution - The Discipline of Getting Things Done.  Great book.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|What on earth are people thinking? That this is interesting because it's barely competent? That the dozens (hundreds) of better films dealing with the the same themes just don't reach a mass audience and so should be ignored? (There are even several Japanese films that explore similar personal crises with grace and power.)<br />As someone who really loves thoughtful personal movies--yes even s-l-o-w ones--I was incensed by this piece of drivel. Bill Murray has a dozen better performances under his belt; this one he phoned in. If the director hadn't been named Coppola, if a brilliant lesser-known actor had played the Murray part, this mess would have sunk without a trace. In a few years, the very few people who might try confront this thing will be wondering--\\"What WERE we thinking?\\" <br />I confess: my taste is hardly mainstream. While I am a Bill Murray fan, I conscientiously avoid all movies with Adam Sandler and his ilk. Still, I was heartened to note that the audience in the theater when I saw it were virtually of the same mind. As they filed out, their antipathy was strong and obvious. But it was an art-house, and they were expecting something of merit.<br />OK--in the first part of the film, there were two interesting--even fine--sequences: one in the studio with the commercial director, the other in the hotel room with the call-girl. The Japanese actors were right on the mark, and together with the situations, they provided perfect setups for Murray to do his thing. After these promising moments, the movie quickly becomes sludge.<br />Come on, American films are a lot better than this. Think \\"The Hours.\\" Think \\"American Beauty.\\" Think \\"War of the Roses.\\" Think \\"Mystic River.\\" Think \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\" Think \\"The Conversation.\\" <br />Now--What do you think of \\"Lost in Translation\\"?<br />Thanks for your thoughts . . .
0767830555|5.0|WOW! This movie was so great. I read some of the other reviews and I could not figure out why some people put 3 start or even 4 stars. This movie definetly deserves much more than 5 stars, but to each his own. I after watching this movie I said to myself wow! I did not think that someone could make such a dark movie. This was so great it shows you what goes on in the insane/criminal mind. But in the end is the most shocking he turns out to be a hero instead of a criminal. Travis goes nuts gets a bad hair cut and kills some gangsters. Then he turns out to be a hero. WHOA what a mind blow not what you would expect at all! Scorsese scores big with this movie! The acting by De Niro is also great! He really makes you belive that he is nuts! Looking for a movie to watch....rent Taxi Driver!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Setting: Ireland in the mid-80s<BR>Backdrop: A miner's strike, a lockout, poverty, anger<BR>Setup: Billy's father has scraped together the $$ for his boxing lessons, but Billy would rather take ballet.<BR>Plot: the local ballet teacher senses his genius, tutors him, and suggest he audition for the London Ballet<BR>You can imagine how this goes down with his macho father and older brother...<BR>The scenes of Billy dancing, leaping, flying through the town on the cobblestones will make every single person grin and tap their toes along with this gifted child performer.<BR>In deft staging, Billy Elliot gently explores politics, religion, sexuality, and family relationships.<BR>An absolute must-see movie for everyone, especially for those who are fans of all things Irish.
6305327041|4.0|Now after the other Tarintino films this was not as good as Pulp Fiction. I wanted to watch this movie because I am a huge Tarintino fan. After watching it I thought that this was a very intertaining movie. I found it very funny and original. The downside to this movie was the very first room. I found that witch plot very over the top but it was so funny. I also found it a little confusing in the second room with the wife and mad husband. But the other 2 rooms were great! And as in all Tarintino movies I thought it had the most hilarious ending! I loved it!
6300215717|5.0|Yeah, she'd been around for a little while before this, but her part in Roman Holiday was the film that really introduced her to the world. My 32yo didn't really have any sense of who she was; to him, she was just a familiar name and face. We watched Roman Holiday together, followed by Breakfast at Tiffany's - and he looked at me as the credits rolled at the end and said, \\"Wow. Okay. I get it.\\"<BR>In Roman Holiday, Hepburn plays a European princess frustrated with her narrow world. She slips away from her handlers to have herself a little incognito fling in Rome - but she's recognized by a reporter, Gregory Peck. He woos her, snaps photos, and intends to publish and get famous, because of course she doesn't know who he is and acts completely natural - not regally royal. But then, well, he really falls for her. And finally, of course, she has to go back to the palace, where she holds an audience for the press - and there he is, her partner in crime who holds the power to ruin her.<BR>It's terrific. She deservedly won an Oscar for the role.
B00005ATQD|4.0|I have to admit this movie wasnt the greatest that Kubrick ever made but I found it really good. I like the way Kubrick makes movies that takes things for granted. As in Eyes Wide Shut he takes a husband who takes his life, wife, and little girl for granted. And then he throws bizarre things at the charecter. I thought this was a great movie. It also shows that marriages are a hard thing to have. After watching this movie my eyes are wide open to people that are married and how hard it must be sometimes.
B000056PWV|5.0|This old classic (with photographer James Stewart confined to his apartment with a cast on his leg and his girlfriend Grace Kelly providing legs for their sleuthing) never fails to satisfy. And it's really, really scary, especially the scene where the suspected murderer (Raymond Burr with menacing gaze and heavy brow) sees Kelly twiddling her finger behind her back, glances out the window and up, up, up to where Stewart is framed in his apartment window across the courtyard. Ridiculous, but even as I type this, I'm getting goosebumps.<BR>The beauty of this film is the way it plays on the role of the voyeur. Stewart amuses himself by spying on his neighbors in the apartment buildings that surround his Greenwich Village courtyard - and we, the viewing audience, get to peek over his shoulder. It's incredibly titillating - until Burr's invalid wife goes missing.<BR>Terrific cure for boredom, both Stewart's and ours, especially with the truly terrifying conclusion.
0393312836|5.0|After reading this book I told said to myself &quot;WOW!&quot; I could not belive that someone could have written such a great book! Burgess scored big with this book. I loved the message that it gave me that people that dont have a choice cannot be people. &quot;A man seizes to be a man&quot; as it is said in the book. The only little throw back in the whole novel was the language. Sometimes it was hard to try and understand what Alex was trying to say with all that &quot;future slang&quot; but even that was so great about the book. A Clockwork Orange is such an original classic nobody to this day has written such a great book. I read the entire book in less than 24 hours. And after I read it I must have watched the movie at least 20 in one week. At the end of the book I acutally was &quot;Cured&quot; as Alex puts it I relized that making choices is such a great thing. That book is now my favorite book of all time. Thank you Anthony Burgess wherever you maybe.
0385507755|5.0|James Frey is breaking new ground in this searing memoir in somewhat the style of Dave Eggers's Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. They're both self-glorifying at the same time they're self-deprecating; the authors are both experimenting with new and original writing techniques; and both deal with pain and heartbreak by writing themselves out of it.<BR>Frey is dealing with addiction, and he writes from within the experience with a surreal immediacy that takes the reader along, after two horrific months in the detox unit, on his journey down the Rocky Road to Recovery. He proves to be a difficult patient at the rehab center - and that's putting it mildly - but it is his very rage and uncooperativeness that are also his strengths.<BR>The present tense increases the gritty reality of Frey's tale, and unlike some who found his free-wheeling habit of playing fast and loose with rules of punctuation, I found his techniques enhanced the reading experience. The aside stories of his fellow inpatients make wonderful vignettes in their own right, but really, none can compete for sheer drama and excess with Frey's own tale, told so well.<BR>I wish him the best.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a docudrama.  That means not everything is true.  What makes this DVD stand out from the earlier VHS version is the story behind the making of Pumping Iron. This special feature alone is worth the purchase of this DVD. For years the muscle media has said that some of this film was staged, but there were many rumors about what was and wasn't true. Butler and cast lay to rest various myths and add some interesting tidbits to the whole package.  Successful bodybuilders know that it takes more than muscles to become famous, and for a short time, we are given a glimpse of what that is all about.  Louie Ferrigno, Mike Katz, Schwarzenegger all talk about what went on behind the scenes.  This is not to say that everything is fictional, because it isn't.  But some of it is.  The beauty of this film is that in the end, we don't really care.  We have seen our heroes and we have been entertained.
B00005JM02|4.0|What should be the new lesson #1 in film school: Boundless technical wizardry cannot cover poor storytelling. Ultimately, every movie must tell a good story to be interesting. Pixar, who commands unparalleled technical resources, devotes more energy into producing quality stories than any other studio. (George Lucas, are you listening?)<br />That said, Finding Nemo is one of Pixar's lesser acheivements. Which is not to say that it is not very good (it is), but next to their other efforts (Toy Story 2, in particular), one can feel a slight lacking. The humor is a bit more juvenile than most of their movies (Mount WannaHockALugee leaping to mind), and the plot is slightly less sublime. If Toy Story 2 was aimed at 8-12 year olds, Finding Nemo is pointed more at ages 6-10. <br />With that said, it is still a very entertaining, well-written movie. Most of the laughs come from Ellen DeGeneres's exasperatingly absent-minded Dory, though the surfer dude/sea turtle Crush steals a few memorable minutes. The animation is, of course, beautiful and it is marvellously captured on DVD (HDTV owners will want this DVD to show off with). The set includes the theatrical widescreen, and an unsual fullscreen version, where, rather than pan-and-scan, Pixar re-rendered the movie in a larger window, so you actually see MORE in the fullscreen than widescreen.<br />The special features are typically rich, as they are in most Pixar movies. People who bought any other Pixar release will recognize the template. <br />All-in-all, a quality release just shy of perfection. Given the target audience, it should have tremendous replay value.
B000001EGA|5.0|Taking the CD of this work from Elton out of it's case, or pulling out your old record, or popping in your old tape cassette of it and pushing play, is like opening up Elton and Bernie's official scrapbook of their lives and career up to the point that this album was released, which was May of 1975. This was Elton's 9th studio album in 6 years, not counting live albums and other such miscellaneous type releases, and while one might of thought the well would of run dry after such a long period of time of pumping out one product after the other, Elton and Bernie released one of their deepest, in depth, and personal albums of their entire careers. However, the well did run dry not too long after this release, with work not up to shape in the late 70's and so on. This release, to me, is the most complete and sincere Elton John album. He's written songs from a personal angel after this, but not such a full and magical and autobiographical album like this. The title track, has a rustic, country swing to it, but turns into a thumping up tempo song later on. It tells basically, how Elton is the super slick city guy(the Captain), and Bernie is the kid still learning and growing from being a farm kid(the brown dirt cowboy). From here on, the rest of the album has the most natural flow and consistency of any Elton John album produced. It goes into more of the music side of their lives with &quot;Tower Of Babel&quot;, and one of the best songs on the disc, &quot;Bitter Fingers&quot;, which has an insanely catchy chorus that goes &quot;I'm sick of all these tra la la's and fa de da's&quot;. Classic Elton. &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot;, is a funky 70's jam that is one of the best songs Elton and Bernie have written in that kind of 70's funk vein. Two songs on the disc deal with the hardships and struggle of getting into and making it in the music business. The super charged rocker, &quot;Gotta Get A Meal Ticket&quot;, is pretty much self explanatory with the title alone. The other, &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, with it's dark, macabre lyrics, and jaunty piano thumping, is a standout track that is also the darkest, albeit still with a toe thumping piano tune, track on the album. A favorite of mine. The song, &quot;Writing&quot;, is also pretty much self explanatory, while the ballad, &quot;We All Fall In Love Sometimes&quot;, is one of the best John-Taupin ballads that wasn't a hit, or a single, but should of been. I have saved the best for last. The 5th track, and the only single released, &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;. A deeply personal track(that hit #6 on the charts), that dealt with Elton's attempted suicide and Bernie saving him. Elton was engaged to Linda Woodrow, albeit not willingly, and decided to end it all instead of getting out of it. He stuck his head in the oven and even laid a pillow in it for his head. Bernie found him and pulled him out. It wasn't a huge life saver, since all the windows in the kitchen in the flat they were staying in were all open at the time!!. Nonetheless, that chapter in their lives is all there in the song. A classic Elton gem. Producer Gus Dudgeon was back on board producing the album, and as always, his work was pure magic and brilliance. This album was not just another hit for Elton, but it made music history. It was the first album in history to debut at #1 on the Billboard Album Charts. All previous #1 albums up to this point charted lower, and climbed to the top spot, but Elton and this album were the first to debut at #1. What a historic thing. There you have it. An album that is probably one of the top 2 quintessential Elton releases. The other being &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; of course. What would be really great, is for Elton and Bernie to do another album like this that could chronicle their lives and careers since the release of this album. That would be great!. I doubt it will happen the way they did it with this album, but with Elton just recently announcing that he will be back in the studio this month recording a new CD for a tentative September 2004 release date, you just never know. Captain Fantastic indeed!.
0385504209|5.0|Without any doubt this was the most enthralling and gripping read I have had in years. It is a well paced thriller, in the real meanbing of the word, written by a master of his craft who has obviously done his in-depth research well. Once you suspend your disbelief about the demonstrable fantasy of the Priory of Sion, the rest falls into place in an enthralling and delightful manner. All with any interest in esoteric history, whether the serious researchers or the fans of the Holy Blood and Holy Grail, should enjoy this delightful romp through the groves of medieval obfuscation.
B00005JLT5|5.0|having grown up in the shadow of the second world war; holocaust, anti-semetism, palestine, the 'bomb' and it attendants--shelters, drills,civil defense, and stories of the glories of great war--this film  measures up to the idea of its totalist destruction as we watch Poland be occupied, the ghetto established, then destroyed, and its it aftermath, warsaw and poland left in ruins unknown to us only now by a vivid comparison of our visual images of September 11. The reality of the set, and the recent events of september 11, still somehow an illigitimate descendant of the great world war--plagued me so vividly the fist time i watched the film, that i was not able to fully appreciate the performance of its lead actor, Adrian Brody, and watch in detail, as the transformation of a human being into less than  unfolds before our eyes as a result of hatred at its zenith. <BR>Again, i watched the film, and again, it seemed so much the same painful recognitions of what we now know about Holocuast, that i was unable to add any further revelations about its shape until i began watching the third, fourth ,and fifth time. slowly , but surely, what i began to see emerge, was exactly how it must have felt to those held captive, enslaved, tortured and killed over the rising political period in Germany, from well before the war, and until first ending when the Allies began the liberation of Europe. I would like to say that it matters how much one knows about the Holocaust, but it doesn't--it is essential in its complete succintness--it tells the tale. That it takes only one chapter of the war, that of the occupation of Poland, the Ghetto and the Uprising, the story of the Pianist itself, and his family; then the everyperson caught in the spiderweb of nazism, is a complete tale. <br />At first, i felt the Pianist to be a arrogant man, one whom could not see the dangers of the world, whom deliberately ignored the world around him; only later on, did i come to understand, that in a world of such hostility, such a skin can make the world bearable, even liveable, even palpable to career, marriage, family, and community. This was whom the Pianist was, as he began his walk to the ghetto with his family that day, on October 31, 1941.  It is painful to watch him become more and more disintegrated--i want the arrogant, playful, talented Pianist to return--i want him to stop this, and stand up again. As i watch him become smaller and more invisible, i begin to realize that the Pianist has learned, how to go into hiding with himself; thus , his seemingly amazing ability to hide from the Germans while in their midst. this is the lesson he learned in order to survive. the can of food, becomes food--not its diminished form--the same as the last shared meal the family has together while awaiting their yet unknown fate. <BR>we hear plenty of what it was to survive in the camps; those too, are stories worthwhile, and eternal--we know what it was for anne frank and her family to survive, but we know little about the many others that hid during the war, both Jewish and Christian alike--it is not the mainstream topic of the Holocaust.<br />the dreams i had as a child, about how it might be easy to survive in the post apolyptic world, was shaken, as i watched this; it is not as my dreams could see it--it was far more that we can even imagine--and that is the very sensibility that Polanksi injects into this movie throught his characters. Each one has their own statement about the survival of this particular end of the world--and it was indeed, the end. And by the end, i began to also comprehend that one singular trait mentioned over and over, in survival stories--that survival depends upon the patience of hope to once again be, combined with  the strange twisted chances of surviving. there are no apologies for survival--there is, the feeling of celebration, more than once, in this movie, of striving to keep alive. <br />For its genre, it deserves its acclaim--it very patiently seduces the viewer into this world, and unfolds its secrets with delicacy, and efficacy of details and minutes and hours of the times. the scene describing how the star of david patch is to be constructed and worn, is one such fine example, among many in the film of watching an intimacy of survival in horror is given to us. <br />I would not have felt comfortable going to the theater for this movie--and while i missed seeing the sets and hearing the theater sound system--this was a movie best viewed at home, when i could take breaks, from feelings of despair, anger, and hopelessness that set in while viewing it. The very ability to extract such powerful emotions from within myself, intuited that very sensibility and and wonderful portrayal of this man's life during these years we are given privy to. This is a keeper, on the shelf, along with others, on the subject. I am hoping that there will be a study guide for this move, soon in print.
B00004YRQA|4.0|When I say this is expensive I'm referring to the list price, not Amazon's price (some places even sell it for 40 bucks).  Now that I've cleared that up let's talk about why this is not only essential for your PS2 but why it's so much better than the one we got on the PSOne.<br />First, this memory card has 8,000KB of space! I don't know about you but that single memory card has lasted me longer than any PSOne memory card (which I had to buy four of because that was only 15 blocks!).  The second best part is that some games can save more than one file without taking up any extra space! Some games create a file soley for the game on the memory card and I can save 15 different files no problem!  So you won't have to purchase a second memory card anytime soon.<br />Sports games (and Socom 2) can use quite a bit of space though. Some sports games can use up 1/4 of the memory card, so watch for that. Still, you'll only use that amount once.  Socom 2...that's a different story. That takes up more than 3,000KB (just thought I'd warn ya).<br />The problems.  Well of course, there's the list price. I only need to pay $25 for my controller so why would I want to pay nearly $40 for the memory card? Again, I'm referring to the list price NOT Amazon's price. I think the price at Amazon is quite fair.<br />The second problem is that you can't save PSOne data onto these cards. A PSOne game won't even read them! Yet you can still copy data from a PSOne memory card to this (NOT a good idea though because you can screw up your PS2 Memory Card).<br />If you want to enjoy your PS2 you'll HAVE to buy this otherwise forget saving and all that stuff.  It's a good investment at least.<br />The Good<br />+8,000KB of space and I'm still on my first one!<br />+Games don't take up that much space<br />The Bad<br />-Doesn't save PSOne games<br />-The List Price is kind of high
B0000VAFO0|5.0|long a fan of the horror genre, specifically the vampire/werewolf/zombie (did you catch 28 days? i saw it at sundance in 2003, and was wowed; even more when it came into wide viewing, and later on, pay ver view, and dvd); i am always looking for the new vision, the new take, new complications, chapter endings, or borrowing to fit a new blend of the horror symbolism and mythology. we can all imagine our own take on the vampire story, especially if you have ever played magic games, read ann rice, did live and online role playing, or even spiced up your celebration of the day of the dead. the same goes for movies about mars, the red planet. i have found it worthwhile to build a collection of the different actors, screenplays and directors visions of whom and what the vampire and werewolf are. this movie was no exception--for me, it was the the edgy future of the vampire movie, complete with open endings for new chapters, that appealed to me. learning that the director vision is derived from his previous music video work, my expectations when i went into the theater was met ---matching some of my own personal colors and imagined faces and interactions in fantasy. Kate Beckinsale became my new heroine, and easily i could imagine myself as her character--wanting to know more, wanting to do more, &quot;on a mission&quot; . what story of life interupted for a mission is not interesting, or secretly wondered about and even desired?<br />since i am disabled, going to the movie theater is a logistic that required patience and co-operation from my fellow attendees. i insist on getting there early, and sitting where i want to sit, not where the theater would like to 'assign' me, which is often the least likely place to view a movie. at this viewing, when i went early, i met other people with the same expectations, already fulfilled from the trailers--to enjoy and relish the visuals and new take on this story. i spoke with several other moviegoers before the before previews cameup, whom were there for their second or third time. This director has a following for his work. it helps that the screen play worked too. this was well worth the effort and time to see the feature, several times, and to invest in the dvd, for the extra features, music video, and other additional footage. this goes on the shelf with the others in the collection of my home dvd library and books on the subject.
0385504209|1.0|Honestly!  What rubbish this was.  It kept me reading only because I wanted to see what incredible (in the proper sense of the word, namely _un_believable) stuff Brown would come up with next.  Rather worse written than Ludlum, or Trevanian, or Clancy or...Definitely forgettable.

B0000931QA|5.0|Queensryche were one of the first bands to play what was later defined as prog-metal when Dream Theater released 'Images and Words'. O:M is IMHO their best record, thanks not only to their fabulous musicianship, but also to the production by Peter Collins, the guy who produced two of the best Rush's records in the eighties ('Hold your fire' and 'Power windows'). For instance, drums sound less agressive than on 'Rage for order' and much more like Neil Peart's drumming on the two previously mentioned Rush records. Vocals sound great, and have never been as good as on this album. The Iron Maiden influence is still present in the vocal tone and in the choirs, but the music is more ambitious. If you like bands mentioned above and don't know anything about QR, O:M is the ultimate QR record to listen to. Play it loud and have fun while listening to it !
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best programs that was ever on TV. FOX really screwed up when the cancelled this show without giving it a chance.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Britney Spears cannot sing and if she could no one would know, because they use some electronic stuff to do weird things with the song. Her songs are so stupid.  Me Against the Music???  have you seen the video?  it is so stupid, because she thinks that she is so great but her music shows no talent at all.  don't buy it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album is played constantly at my house and I'm the one who plays it, a 17 year old. The whole album has some of the most beautiful pop song writing I've ever heard. The harmonizing on &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot; blows me away everytime I listen and I constantly relisten just to hear the beauty in that song. Everytime I listen to this album, I think about everything that happened with Brian Wilson and how this album was his way to show himself. I don't know how he could think of all he did. This album deserves to be in everyone's collection.
B0000U0X1G|3.0|Yes, jackbooted police enforcers are good, knocking down walls and shooting hostages for the good of the state! Well, that is the underlying message of this film, but I still enjoyed watching this even-paced action flick. <br />Despite the hammer-headed storyline (even the Thunderbirds could'nt handle a learjet like the pilots in this movie yet the chopper pilots never had any idea how to auto-rotate their craft during an emergency) and cliched characters, the film was comfortable to watch due in part to the solid performances of the actors and stuff does blow up real good. <br />This by-the-numbers action film is worth a look.
B00009ATKS|5.0|This album is one of those rare pieces of music that is good the first time you listen to it, and the 1000th time.  If you're a fan of radiohead that particulary liked &quot;How to dissappear completely&quot; and &quot;Climbing up the walls&quot;, you will be blown away by this record.  It will relax you into a trance and before you realize what's happening it will escalate brilliantly.  The mood this album creates is by far the best thing about it, although the interaction between the guitars and violins/cellos is amazing as well.  If you are into any softer music or want to explore it, buy this record.  This is truly beautiful music
B00006879E|5.0|When I first heard Maroon 5, I was in awe. I had never really heard anyone who sounded like them. Adam Levine's voice is very soulful and passionate and not only is he vocally talented, but he is a great songwriter as well. He wrote or co-wrote all the &quot;songs about Jane&quot; on the album and they are all beautiful. It's difficult for me to choose favorites, because they are all great, but I would say that I especially like, of course, &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; (the first single released), &quot;This Love&quot; (second single), and, well, all of the tracks. I'd only list all of them anyway. This is definitely a great album for anyone who enjoys rock music and likes a little funk and soul as well, or for anyone who just enjoys good music.
B000089CPF|5.0|Yes, 'Feast of Wire' is great! Just saw another of their hometown performances at The Temple of Music and Art (a sellout) where they played close to half the songs on 'Feast of Wire' and 'Hot Rail.' Calexico is supercharged live and 'Feast of Wire' is a great entree to their uniquely Sonoran Desert blend of mariachi horns, steel guitars and other instruments that surround Joey Burns's vocals and guitar and John Convertino's syncopatic drumming.
B000001EPB|3.0|Un poco pretencioso el ttulo que se ha &quot;auto-asignado&quot; este hombre con eso de &quot;El seor de la danza&quot;... Espctaculo bastante lamentable y que poco tiene que ver con la tradicin. En cuanto a la msica, creo que hay recopilaciones de msica celta mucho mejores, incluso trabajos como Riverdance. Aunque sigo prefiriendo los discos de Planxty, Silly Wizard o los de los Cunningham, por poner unos pocos ejemplos.
B0000931QA|5.0|I first heard Queensryche on the now defunct &quot;Headbanger's Ball&quot; which was paved over for shows like TRL on the awful network MTV. I first heard &quot; Revolution Calling&quot;, then &quot;Speak&quot;. I heard these two songs and realized... i need to get this album! The videos play an intrigal part in making Operation Mindcrime an essential must have. here is a great story that goes along with the twin guitar attack of Degarmo and Wilton,the pulse pounding rythym of Jackson and Rockenfeld, and of course the great vocals of one of rock's most underated vocalists...Geoff Tate. It is ashamed most people never think of this great band that came out of Seattle. They were metal in a new way that was daring and conceptual. They weren't a hair or grunge band. I recommend this albmum highly as well as there commercial smash &quot;Empire&quot;. It is one of the great concept albums in the tradition of ones such as &quot;I-ROBOT&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot;
B00004XOWM|1.0|it sucks bad,but it says limp bizkit right on the front. consider that the warning lable. if you like raprock and don't worry about quility, this is a winner for loosers.
B000026C3T|5.0|This double album has all the great songs that Led Zeppelin has ever released. Now if you buy this album you will not need to buy any other albums because the best songs are right here, everything from I to Pysical Graffiti and Houses of the Holy.<BR>Stairway to Heaven (my favourite zeppelin song) is featured on the album too. Good art inside to. Most zeppelin albums don't ever have pictures in the booklet, this one dose.
B0000AQS6U|4.0|I bought this album days ago, being honest it isnt as good as I though It would be.<BR>This first cd is a nice one, has all the Chers biggest hits and two remixes: One By One (remixed by Junior Vazquez) and A different Kind Of Love Song (by Rodney Jerkins, and yes, It has his classic &quot;darkchild&quot; sound.<BR>The Farewell album could have been better, Chers voice sounds so cool but the music doesnt.<BR>Honestly I recomend this album, besides, the mexican version of this has also 2 cds but both are a recopilation, the live one is not incluided, so check it out.
B000005ALN|5.0|I recently bought George Michaels video LADIES AND GENTLEMAN- THE BEST OF GEORGE MICHAEL, and I must say that it one of the best I have EVER heard!<br /> Not only is one of the most HANDSOMEST men on the planet, but he can dance, sing, and choreograph very well!!!<br /> I am happy to own this collection, which has one of my favorite songs- FASTLOVE!!! I rate HIM and this song 10!!!!!! <br />KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, GEORGE!!!
B00005221L|4.0|What if we were suddenly the deer in the field? Being stalked by an undetectable force with unimaginable weapons. The predator kills by skull size much like humans kill by weight or antlers. It hunts for pleasure. Planet to planet. A action packed film that reverses the hunting expierince. With Arnold in the movie what can you expect. His acting is great, and the make-up effects on the Predator are seamless. A great movie. A must buy, i reccomend anyone pick it up for there collection.
B000005ALN|5.0|I purchased the video THE BEST OF GEORGE MICHAEL, and I LOVE IT!! Not only is he a talented musician, but he is HANDSOME, and a good dancer and singer!<br /> My favorite vidoe from this collection is FASTLOVE, and the song I love best is I KNEW YOU WERE WAITING (FOR ME).<br /> I hope he keeps up the good work!
B00006RJHG|5.0|This movie was both scarey and hilarious, I love the house mother, she just made the movie!  And bravo to Margot Kidder!  I really wanted to keep this in my collection but had to sell it, it would be a fantastic addition to your horror DVD's!  I could not find the movie to rent anywhere, it is worth buying new or used.
0385504209|1.0|If you are in any way familiar with anything to do with the templars then you know 90% familiar with everything this book has to offer by way of plot.  There is no character development of any sort.  Not even a good summer read; give it a miss.
B00008977N|5.0|I like concert videos and I have both DVD and VCR versions of this. I am glad I read these reviews because I learned that the sound is much improved if you change it from the default DTS to Dolby 2.0 (unless you're using DTS in which case never mind).<br />There have been some changes made for the DVD and not all for the better. I think some of the &quot;grainy&quot; complaints are because the filmmaker has chosen to add closeups which weren't really there... i.e. picking a small portion of the frame and blowing it up to make it a close up and naturally that makes those shots a bit grainy. Some of the choice of shots is a bit disappointing in comparison with the original and there's a bit more of the MTV jerkiness (in every sense of the word) about camera mix in a couple of numbers. You get grainy close-ups and disconcerting cross-cuts at the expense of the wider views that show you what's actually going on. OTOH there's also a few places where the choices of shot are better than the original - patriculary giving a little more prominence to the fabulous Manu Katche (sp?) in the opening number.<br />That stated, this is still absolutely the best concert video bar none that I own or have owned. House of Yes comes quite close also 90125 - but that was rather more than a concert video anyway.<br />I've always liked PG's music without ever being a real fan but this is an almost perfect mix of styles and theatrics and special effects. <br />Yes it's highly choreographed - that's the show he's putting on. You don't go to a ballet and complain because it's too choreographed and the same complaint is just as out of place here. The musicians are all phenomenal, the show is wonderful and imaginative, it's long but never gets boring. Every song has its own identity both musically and visually. The musicians, even while they're following their choregraphed movements, are plainly enjoying themselves - and the music - and even the slight campiness of putting movement to the music;enjoying themselves enormously.<br />When I watch this video, and I do often, I get a gut sadness that I wasn't at the show to experience it live and a real joy at the recorded experience I AM getting. The very best music can bring up emotions and touch you very personally and this is the very best. <br />I love this video.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I just have to say that Britney's my role model. She's my absolute most favourite dancer, singer and entertainer. This cd shows how she has evolved into a beautiful, well developed, intellectual young woman. This is my absolute favourite cd of all time. She's so versatile and she shows that in each song. Here are the ratings of the songs:<br />1)Me against the music f. Madonna- 9/10<BR>2)(I got that) Boom Boom f. Ying Yang Twins- 9.5/10<BR>3)Showdown- 8.5/10<BR>4)Breathe on me- 9.5/10<BR>5)Early mornin'- 5/10 Awful, Awful song.<BR>6)toxic- 11/10 The best song on this album!!!<BR>7)Outrageous- 9/10<BR>8)Touch of my hand- 8/10<BR>9)The hook up- 8/10<BR>10)Shadow- 8/10<BR>11)Brave new girl- 8.5/10<BR>12)Everytime- 10/10 second best song on the album!!!!<BR>13)Me against the music- 7/10<br />Overall this album is worth the money. You should get this album cause it's one of the best albums out there. I love this album and I'll never take it out of my cd player. Britney will be her for long whether you like it or not.
B00000IQV7|5.0|reviewer: nerdness is a complete and utter moron.  This movie is based on a true story (apparently you missed that being mentioned during it) and is all true events that actually happened.  Hunter &quot;Patch&quot; Adams changed the entire medical profession with what he did and for the better no less.  Sadly, looking at other reviews from 'nerdness' he sounds like he's in 9th or 10th grade so take his review as such (dumb teenaged kid that knows all).<br />Going into the medical profession myself, I plan to use humor to it's fullest extent possible to help patients.  This movie is awesome (5 out of 5).  If you don't like it, seek medical help :)
B0000DZEE3|5.0|That has gotta be one of the best concerts I've seen. I wish I was there. I believe that everyone has got to see this. Even people who aren't fans may be converted by this amazing performance. Too bad Flea didn't rip it up with any bass solos, but his trumpet solo was unexpected but good. Definetely worth the price.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I loved The Matrix. This movie was jam packed full of stuff we have never seen before and brilliant dialogue spouting line after line of philosophy inspiring a new truth 'What is the Matrix'. Couldn't wait for the sequel, but we've seen what they have done with sequels before right?<br />Then The Matrix was partialy blamed for the Colombine tragedy,(which is plain stupid) and they have taken this to heart and suddenly Neo is dressed in long robes of a priest rather than the long leather coat and don't blink or you'll miss the guns... they just aren't used anymore. Ho-hum brought to you by Responible Film-making of the 21st Century.<br />New characters are introduced and not fully explained then killed off and your left wondering why bother?<br />The fight of the 100 Smiths was incredible at the beginning and then just dragged out and the high way scene just made you feel like you'd seen it all before - you did - better in fact - IN THE FIRST ONE.<br />Yep - I'm dissapointed - still I'll have it in my collection in the 'What could've been' section.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Spoiler Warning.<br />The trick to understanding this movie is to realise that Donnie's alternate reality is a dream/premonition of a possible future that could happen if he chooses to get out of bed before the jet engine hits his room.<br />The alternate reality is a creation of Donnie subconscious mind and Frank is a physical representation of that subconscious mind, within that alternate reality.<br />Frank is the part of Donnie's mind that created the alternate reality.<br />Frank guides Donnie, who is one of the characters within that alternat reality down the correct path.<br />Frank knows everything that is going to happen, how long the alternate reality will exist for and every character within that alternate reality.<br />The time travel idea is another part of Donnie's subconscious mind, which gives Donnie a doorway out of the alternate reality and back to normal reality. <br />Frank and the time travel part of the film are not meant to be taken literally, they are just parts of Donnie's subconscious mind.<br />If you look at the film in this way it will begin to make sense.<br />I think that anybody that gives this film a five star rating in some way understands this and understands how clever and mind blowing this film is.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Saw the movie with my wife when it first hit the theatres. Bought the DVD for my soulmate recently... destiny? I dont know what my destiny is anymore... there are so many signs for me to be with my soulmate, my heart already no longer at home... what should I do? I think I'm destined not to be with my soulmate, at least not in this life.
1883217040|5.0|^^ don't listen to fffcj...<br />this book is thoroughly informatve and the many music examples only help to further your understanding of what is being explained. <br />This book goes into many detailed explanations of various concepts (beginner to advanced) and provides many valuable examples/recordings in which you can referrance the topic to. including the many footnotes and sidebars which ARE very important and certainly deserved to be in the book. the footnotes also help to eliminate alot of clutter that would have been inevitable had Mark included them in the main body of text. <br />One thing i was very happy about with this book is not as clinical as alot of other books. The Author talks to you as if you were having it explainied to you by a private teacher. Including humor and real world clarifications. <br />Jazz Theory can clear up many things you may have been hazy on, and also teach many things you had no clue about. this book gets 10 stars out of 5.
B00008PW2D|5.0|There has been talk that season 5 sucked, but that is only for the superficial fans wanting just sex and no depth or humour behind it. The 4 main characters (Charlotte, Carrie, Samantha, and Miranda) really grow and the season is irreverent, funny, touching, and all actors are fabulous!!! I watched all 8 episodes and was left yearning for more!!!
B00008PC2O|3.0|Can any body tell me if this edition contains the footage where linda hamilton cops a bit of a hiding from the wardens in the mental institution? I have only once seen the full movie on cable, and have yet to find a dvd or vhs that contains that footage.  It is important in the context because it explains why linda takes to the medo with the mop handle with such gusto.<BR>Ray Duncan
B00008YLV2|5.0|Overall this is a great movie. It shows the comraderie between men at war. The supporting cast was amazing Ewan Mcgregor did a terrific job as the clerk &quot;Grimes&quot;, Eric Bana as Delta Operator Norm Hooten and my personal favorite Tom Sizemore as Mcknight.<BR>I have something to say to people who gave this a one star,<BR>THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT'S WHY THERE IS SO MUCH BLOOD!!!! OUR SOLDIERS WENT THROUGH THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMFR|4.0|This film had such high expectations, so no wonder many hated it. I, for one, thought this movie was an excellent way to end the Matrix saga. With spectacular battles, amazing visuals, and some classic characters, this is a definate must-see for any sci-fi fan. It's not as good as the first, but it is still an entertaining and enjoyable film.
0345451325|4.0|This book was an amazing start to the series. It gave an enthralling backround to the SPARTAN II project and to the Human-Covenant conflict. If you own Halo the game this gives you all the backround you need to know to tie up those loose ends. I recommend reading this book as well as the whole series. Even if you're not a sci fi type of person, you'll enjoy it because there is still the modern human element underlying through the whole story.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a great song,listen to the words and to really see how deep this song is....MY FAVORITE
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Has Hollywood truly run out of good ideas? It sure seems that way with the large amount of sequels and remakes invading movie theaters this year. You think its bad now? Wait until next year. For the time being, let's focus on the entries for 2003. Many of the high profile features this summer are sequels including The Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and X2: X-Men United while remakes seemed to restricted to the lower profile projects such Freaky Friday and The Italian Job. Most modern movie-goers may not be familiar with the original The Italian Job which starred Michael Caine, Benny Hill, and Noel Coward in this 1969 British caper comedy. The latest version of the classic film features actor Mark Wahlberg, who has become known his roles in other remake films such as The Planet of the Apes and The Truth About Charlie, neither of which received exceptionally high praise from critics or the public. Will his presence in yet another remake continue the trend? Maybe the presence of Edward Norton and Charlize Theron, two other well known performers, can counterbalance any negativity from Wahlberg's past. One thing's for sure, the sight of mini-coopers driving down subway stairs sure has drawn plenty of attention. Let's just hope there's more behind this film then that.<br />The story follows a group of thieves as they try to pull a huge heist on a former colleague who ripped them off a year ago. Charlie Croker loves his profession almost as much as his mentor. What profession is that? Theft. John Bridger realizes he is getting older and decides that he is getting to the point where he wants to slow down and spend time with his daughter. In coming to this decision, he wants to hand the reins over to Charlie in helping him pull off one last great heist before his retirement. After the crew consisting of inside man Steve, computer whiz Lyle, explosive expert Left-Ear, and wheel-man Rob are successful in this heist of nearly $35 million in gold, they aresuddenly double-crossed by Steve, who kills John and leaves the others for dead. Though the others survive, they are still saddened by the loss of their group leader. That's why one year later when they catch up with their former associate, they employ John's daughter Stella in helping them steal the gold back and avenge John's death. Even without seeing the original film, the story for The Italian Job is rather predictable but it the cleverly choreographed action sequences that save this production from being mundane.<br />There a reason why the Paramount marketing team is focusing on The Italian Job's action sequences; the film has no real star power behind. At least none that would bring in a reasonable crowd on their name alone. Mark Wahlberg, who, as it was said before, best known for his performances in past remakes, show improvement in his acting ability from his previous entries but not enough to solidify him for anything outside of future remakes. Edward Norton, best known for his roles in American History X and Fight Club, gives a wonderfully villainous performance that will leave everyone watching the film absolutely despising his character. Charlize Theron gives a decent performance in this film but still leaves a sense that the filmmakers used her just as eye-candy for this feature. Not her fault, but obviously there could have been better used for her in this film. And Donald Sutherland gives a delightful performance despite his limited time on screen.<br />Overall, the amusing performances and spectacular action sequences save this film from being less then a mediocre retread. Unfortunately as good as the filmmakers try to make this film out to be, The Italian Job doesn't even come close to the prestige of other crime capers such as Ocean's Eleven. There may be many reasons behind this; the fact that none of the performers, outside of possibly Edward Norton, have really showcased their full acting talent in any other high-profile features to make thismore then just humorous or slightly enjoyable. Maybe it's the fact that, unlike Ocean's Eleven, the audience pretty much knows what is going to happen before they even get comfortable in their seats. Blame the marketing for pretty much showcasing the entire film in the trailer but the premise itself doesn't help the suspense factor of this film either. Had the filmmakers added a few more twists and turns in the plot of the remake rather then just modernizing the original crime capper then maybe this would have been more then a moderate piece of escapism. Rather then dwelling on what could have been, The Italian Job doesn't require you to leave your head at the door like other summer features but it does test the believability of some movie-goers.
B00008RH1H|3.0|The remastering is slightly noticably better than the VHS, <BR>but only slightly. The image format is also not wide-screen.<BR>The two special features, a running commentary and a second <BR>subtitling, disappoint.<br />The commentary focuses largely on comparing the film to macbeth.<BR>Macbeth was an inspiration for the film, but Throne of Blood is<BR>not Macbeth.  Yet the commentator insists on referring to the <BR>protagonist as Macbeth!  The commentator also assumes that the <BR>viewer is thoroughly familiar with Macbeth and all the <BR>characters in it, making frequent references to scenes, plots,<BR>and characters in Macbeth instead of discussing the film on hand.<BR>For commentaries well done, see those of the Seven Samurai and <BR>the Road to Perdition.<br />The second subtitling by Hoaglund is much inferior to the<BR>original subtitling by Richie (also on the VHS version).  <BR>Here's Richie's subtitling of the opening chorus: <BR>Behold, within this place/Now desolated, stood/<BR>Once a mighty fortress/Lived a proud warrior/<BR>Murdered by ambition/His spirit walking still/<BR>Vain pride, then as now, will/Lead ambition to the kill.<BR>That of Hoaglund: Look upon the ruins/Of the castle of <BR>delusion/Haunted only now/By the spritis/Of those who <BR>perished/A scene of carnage/Born of consuming desire/<BR>Never changing/Now and throughout eternity.<BR>I don't know Japanese and cannot tell which is closer to the<BR>original.  However, I find Richie's immediate, direct, and <BR>tight, while Hoaglund's is wandering, limp, and tepid.<BR>The same for the subtitling of the dialogues. In the first <BR>scene, when a messenger rushes in to tell the Lord that the<BR>battle has been won, Hoaglund has him use \\"tides of war\\" <BR>instead of just plainly saying \\"we've won.\\"  Which common <BR>peasant soldier would use term such as \\"tides of war\\"?  Hoaglund <BR>also use \\"barricade,\\" \\"confine,\\" etc. instead of \\"siege,\\" the<BR>general term used when holding a castle.  Whenthe rebel sues <BR>for peace by offering to shave his head, Hoaglund doesn't even <BR>mention this in the subtitle!  The two subtitles cannot be shown<BR>together for comparison either.<br />The slightly better image may be worth five bucks, not thirty.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|\\"But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible.\\"<br />One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.<br />Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a \\"Death Dealer\\", an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being \\"loosely\\" based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.<br />The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.<br />Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
B000066NW0|3.0|How anyone could like this album is beyond me!! The songs are kind of bland and you could actually get bored listening to them. They aren't anything to dance to, nothing to chill to, it's just thirteen songs about Avril complaining about her life and daring to be different. Avril couldn't sing for her life which doesn't help the songs either.<BR>For example:<br />Losing Grip: 6/10, This is the type of song where you could listen to it for the first two weeks and then afterwards you wouldn't listen to it anymore. The whole album is like that actually.<BR>Complicated: 5/10, Avril is basically stating the point to be real in this song except she switches it a little for her to be about her ex-boyfriend or whatever, it's a nice song to listen to on Sundayz.<BR>Sk8er Boi: 4/10, maybe if you're a punk-rocker you'll like this song but it's actually about romance. This is a dumb song and isn't worth anyone's time what so ever. Avril sounds horrible in it and the lyrics are atrocious.<BR>I'm With You: 5/10, this song is very whiny and doesn't have very much creative lyrics. It a slow song and you probably couldn't listen to this song at anytime unless you are depressed, mad, or sad. Or it'll probably put you in one of those moods. <BR>Mobile: 7/10, this is an okay song, I kind of liked it. But again Avril sounds horrible and she kind of complains about her career in this one. <BR>Unwanted: 7/10, this song is pointless, it's about nothing really, it's kind of a hard song, it's the only semi-rock song on here, Avril just whines in this song too.<BR>Tomorrow: 6/10, this song is slow too, it's one of those guitar songs, I don't know if I really like this song or not, it's one of those country type songs. <BR>Anything but Ordinary: 5/10, Avril tries to act too different in this song. She talks about that she likes to laugh herself to sleep, she likes to scream aloud and drive really fast. Just a bunch of chaos. <BR>Things I'll Never Say: - I forgot what it sounded like, sorry.<BR>My World: 4/10, Ugh! This song makes me sick, Avril basically tells her whole life story in this song. Basically bragging making everyone think her life was full of fun and jokes. <BR>Nobody Fool: 4/10, this song is embarrassing!!! Avril tries to rap in this song..can you imagine?? Avril is totally off tune in this song and her voice crackles and screeches.<BR>Too Much To Ask: - Forgot what this one sounded like too.<BR>Naked: 9/10, this is the only good song on here. It probably has about an alternative music sound. <br />This album has a few good songs here and there. If you can't tolerate horrible voices this isn't the album to get. But if you like alternative music, don't mind the voices, and just a few cheesy songs (like about 5 of them of the thirteen) then I'm sure you wouldn't mind it.
0679879269|4.0|I must agree, Pullman does preach. And unlike some people who preach Christianity with zaelotry, he preaches against Christianity. I can't say I disagree with him too much, because of my beliefs, but nevertheless, it's obvious what Pullman's message is without the constant preaching and it does get uncomfortable a few times.<br />A few moments also left me disappointed. One would really think that Father Gomez could so much more, and I was expecting with dread what was going to happen and then all of a sudden, it's all over without much effort. That part was a little unconvincing.<br />The ending also left me longing for more. After all the stories put together piled up in the end and you were just awaiting that climax... and then it was over. The ending of the story could've suited one book separately. But the greatness of the seriest was kind of swallowed up by the unoriginality of the finale. Of course, it was dramatic and Pullman's writing nearly drew tears out of my eyes (and I'm not the touchy type either), but despite it all the ending seemed unconvincing.<br />That is why I gave this book 4 stars. But those few moments, only 10-20 minutes of reading in total were nothing compared to the thrill of the rest of the story. Every chapter was great and I could hardly find a place to stop, so I had to stay up until 4 am, 5 am, 6 am (luckily, it was Xmas vacation), the last night of my reading I didn't even go to sleep to finish off the book.<br />Pullman says he got his ideas from a multitude of other books. Well, perhaps. But the originality with which he put this world together, with which he created something so totally different and yet so totally the same (a make-like), is genius.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is an incredible band, and this is an incredible album. The lyrics are thought-provoking, the vocals are smooth, and the sound is excellent. I could listen to &quot;Karma Police, &quot;Idioteque, &quot;Climbing Up The Walls, &quot;Electioneering,&quot; and, most of all, &quot;Let Down&quot; forever and not get tired of these songs. Radiohead is second to none. Any (even remote) fan of the Alternative genre is missing out without listening to Radiohead. Even those who aren't familiar with the style of music will, generally, be brought in by such an unparalleled band.<br />I highly recommend this album. One of the most worthwhile ~$15 you'll ever spend.
078322799X|4.0|When his growing legions of fans work their way back through the early films of Peter Jackson to determine how the man who started off directing comic gorefests like &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Dead Alive&quot; ended up being entrusted with &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; this 1996 film will be the last link in the chain because it was after &quot;The Frighteners&quot; that Jackson devoted himself to bringing Tolkien to the big screen.  Like every film he has ever made, &quot;The Frighteners&quot; shows a relentless creativity, although ultimately the story is not up to the impressive special effects.  Consequently, while enjoyable, the film is also somewhat disappointing because we really expected something better in a film where Jackson finally had money to play with.<br />&quot;The Frighteners&quot; is a horror-comedy that falls a bit short of both halves of the equation although it starts off strong enough.  Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a paranormal investigator who shows up in the small town of Fairweather, California.  Bannister is a most unusual con artist, because not only can he really see ghosts, he has three of them working for him: Stuart (Jim Fyfe), Cyrus (Chi McBride), and the Judge (John Astin).  The ghostly trio put the fear of the undead into someone and then Bannister shows up and drives them away: for a small fee (with a money back guarantee).  But then the husband of Lucy Lynsky (Trini Alvardo) drops dead and so do a lot of other people in town, all from heart attacks, and usually after seeing Bannister.  He knows that the killer is the Soul Catcher, because he can not only see it attack, he can see the numbers that appear on the foreheads of his intended victims.  Then things get complicated.<br />By the time we find out what the opening scene of the film, where unseen spirits are terrifying loony old Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), the contrivances are too mind-numbing to really care.  Apparently there is a point to all this having to do with the competitiveness of Americans even in the realm of serial killing.  Bannister's attempts to play the hero are consistently thwarted by Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs), an F.B.I. agent who is equal parts hardcase and nutcase.  Every time he did something weird I found myself saying, &quot;Well, okay then.&quot;  His antics usually engendered a laugh, but it was just never quite the right type of laugh, having too much of a skeptical edge to it.  If there is one think you do not want you audience to be when you are doing a horror movie with ghosts, it would be skeptical.<br />Despite the problems with the convoluted narrative and the uneven tone of the comedy, this is still a film worth watching just to see what Jackson pulls out of his special effects bag of tricks next.  Clearly the best of the pre-LOTR movies from Jackson is definitely &quot;Heavaenly Creatures,&quot; which speaks to the director's strengths in terms of not just special effects but also with adaptations, whether from a literary classic or from infamous historical events.  This means that his announced next project, a remake of &quot;King Kong,&quot; plays to these strengths as well.this having to do with the competitiveness of Americans even in the realm of serial killing.

B0000DCGT3|5.0|First off, there are no broadcasts like in the other 2 movies- \\"Nadia Cam\\" and \\"The Big Broadcast\\". Stifler manages to make friends among the gay community in a dance-off, Jim pops the question among other things in a restaurant, Finch does a personality switch with Stifler, and for the first time, Kevin is absolutely speechless.<br />My favorite part is the dance-off in the gay bar featuring \\"She's a Maniac\\", \\"Heaven is a Place on Earth\\", and \\"Sweet Dreams\\". It's not Jim making a fool of himself but it is equally entertaining.<br />I would recommend this to anybody who loves \\"Animal House\\" and the other \\"American Pie\\" movies.
0385504209|4.0|In the &quot;Poetics,&quot; his famous study of Greek dramatic art, Aristotle compares tragedy to such other metrical forms as comedy and epic poetry. He argues that tragedy, like all poetry, is a kind of imitation (mimesis), but adds that it has a serious purpose and uses direct action rather than narrative to achieve its ends. Aristotle holds that poetic mimesis is imitation of things as they could be, not as they are (i.e., of universals and ideals). Consequently, poetry--that is to say, all literature--is a more philosophical and exalted medium than history, which merely records what actually happened.  Aristotle was defending poetry as much as explaining it because there were those in ancient Greece who were deeply offended that anyone should create works of fiction.<br />That would seem to explain some of the reaction to Dan Brown's bestseller, &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; that has enraged many theologians who have denounced it as anti-Catholic.  Brown takes some credible theories about the early Christians, mines the paintings of Leonardo for helpful symbolism, and creates a series of codes left behind by a dying man, to create a thriller with Biblical implications.  However, along the way there is a consistent and compelling critique, not so much of the Catholic Church of today, but of the early history of Christianity.  The person who takes the biggest drubbing in the book is not the Pope (either one of them that figure in the story), but the Emperor Constantine.  The idea that &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; constitutes a revisionist view of Christianity is pretty ironic since it was Paul's transformation of the teachings of Jesus into something more palatable for the Gentiles of the Roman Empire, the history of Christianity has been one of transformation.<br />The big question then becomes whether or not &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a theological argument dressed up as a mystery that should have been advanced as a scholarly treatise.  The position that Christianity fueled a patriarchal society at the expense of Mother Earth permeates the novel, but ultimately it is part of the rationale for solving the mystery, existing more as a function of narrative than a rhetorical stance.  Then again, I have no problem with the idea that Jesus will always be an important historical figure, regardless of what information might be discovered or revealed in the future.  By the same token, speculation about a possible marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene does nothing to distract from the power of his ministry.  On the other hand, I fully realize that such a position will be regarded by a great many as heresy, so I grant that the very premise of Brown's novel will be considered offensive by a great many people.  All I can offer in response is the belief that Brown was not intending to challenge such beliefs, but wanted to take some interesting ideas and creatively filling some gaps to make a compelling mystery.  The key supporting evidence for this idea would be that most of the key characters take all of this for granted, so that they are always explaining rather than advocating these various ideas.<br />Of course, there will be those who are disappointed to find out that everything in this fictional novel is not true and who will be upset that this is indeed a work of fiction.  But so what if Leonardo Da Vinci did not hide clues about church secrets in his paintings?  All Brown needs is a willing suspension of disbelief on the part of his readers (which may be another reason that true believers are grossly offended by the theological &quot;politics&quot; of this novel); from the perspective of symbolists you can &quot;find&quot; lots of things in any artwork from Da Vinci to Degas to Dali to Dr. Seuss.  The idea that that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute is a potent one because it speaks to the power of redemption, where even a fallen woman can be saved.  Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion are real organizations, but unless you were well vested in such things it would not have mattered if Brown had made up names for the two groups.  But clearly Brown wanted to keep his story as close to the real world as possible, for obvious reasons.  If you want to separate the truth from fiction with &quot;The Da Vinci Code,&quot; then just wait patiently: I am sure several books claiming to do just that will be published in 2004 (and all of them together will probably sell one-tenth as many copies as Brown's novel).  It would especially be nice to have a book that collects images of all the works of art and places that are so pivotal in the novel.<br />&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a quick and engaging read, where the storytelling matters more than the writing, especially when we are involved in breaking the various codes and making the pieces fit.  Actually, I was rather surprised that the cast of characters remained rather small, but the scope of the conspiracy has historical depth rather than contemporary breadth (turning the novel into a screenplay is not going to be difficult: i.e., no characters of subplots have to be eliminated).  The characters exist to play the games, solve the riddles, and break the codes because very few readers are going to have a chance to do any of that.  I know that Da Vinci wrote backwards in his notebooks and that there are strong similarities between the face of the Mona Lisa and Da Vinci's self portrait, so I was ahead of the curve on a few points, but overall I was just along for the ride (I also knew a bit from playing &quot;Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned&quot;).  The ending made sense to me from both a narrative standpoint, especially in terms of what ending you could hope to get away with in the context of keeping the story as &quot;real&quot; as possible.  But there is also the attendant irony, given the controversy over the book's &quot;attack&quot; on the Chruch, that the ending constitutes more of a matter of faith.ss you were well vested in such things it would not have mattered if Brown had made up names for the two groups.

B00005AQE8|5.0|all i have 2 say about this album is listen to it disc 1 to disc 2 and listen ALL THE WAY THROUGH it's a calming piece of work.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|Quit while your ahead&quot;  Boy that's one piece of advise the folks in Hollywood don't pay attention to and this Alien Boxed set (the second one by the way) is sure proof of that.  This nine disc set contains two versions of all four Alien movies.  The original theatrical versions and the special director cuts.  I am not a big fan of director cuts.  They usually contain footage that was edited out.  I figure if they weren't good enough to make the theatrical cut why do I want to watch them on DVD?  Yeah, I know the extended version of Lord of the Rings are good but they are the exception and not the rule.<BR> <BR>Anyway the first movie Alien came out in 1979 and is still a great horror flick.  You all know they story.  A group of cosmic truck drivers are called to check out an S.O.S. beacon on a dead planet.  A guy named Kane played by John Hurt gets the infamous facehugger stuck to him and he is carried back to the star ship by his fellow astronauts.  After trying to unsuccessfully remove the facehugger the thing just disappears and over dinner the baby Alien burst out of Kane's chest leaving a bloody mess.  One by one all the crew members are killed by the Alien, except for Ripley, played by Sigourey Weaver.  She kills the alien which means she gets to be in all the other Alien movies.  Oh I forgot, Ash, played by Ian Holm, is not killed by the alien.  It turns out Ash is a robot who works for the company that wants to analyze the alien.  He's killed by Ripley and Parker (Yaphet Kotto).  Alien is great science fiction and great horror. It gets a &quot;9.0&quot; on the scale. The big selling point here is the added footage of the first movie.  There is really nothing new here as the added footage was in the deleted scene section of the original Alien DVD release.<BR> <BR>In 1986 Aliens came out.  Ripley is found drifting in hyper space and brought back to earth where she is in trouble for blowing up the ship in the first movie.  They think she's full of crap about that whole Alien business.  She learns quickly that the planet in which the alien has been colonized and warns her company that soon people will die.  Well, before you know it people die and Ripley is know a person of expertise and is ask to accompany some marines to this planet for their simple task in killing the aliens.  Well, the task proves not to be so simple and a lot of marines die.  The action is all pretty good.  There is a lot of blood shed and gore which left me feeling very happy.  The supporting cast is pretty good, including Bill Paxton as a cowardly marine and Lance Hendrickson as the robot doctor.  Oh, the little girl was pretty good too.  The first alien a science fiction horror movie where this is more geared towards the action crowd.  The finale between Ripley and the queen alien is the highlight of the series.  Aliens gets an &quot;8.0&quot; on the scale.<BR> <BR>Alien 3 is where things start to go downhill.  Even director David Fincher was not pleased with this sack of crap and refused to do a director's commentary.  The story this time is that Ripley is in her shuttle from Aliens and crashes on a planet that's pretty much a penal colony.  The other two passengers, including the little girl are dead.  Little does she know Ripley also brought along the alien which will now kill the prisoners until it's destroyed.  The drama this time around is that Ripley was impregnated by the alien while on the shuttle.  This movie focuses on gore a little to much.  I found the sensationalizing of Newt's autopsy a little unnerving.  Also, this may seem harsh but why would I care about a bunch of criminals who are being eaten by an alien.  Except for Charles Dutton the supporting cast is kind of annoying.  And finally, the end just sucks.  Alien 3 gets a &quot;5.0&quot; on the scale.<BR> <BR>Now Alien Resurrection stars Brad Dourif.  Except for The Two Towers and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, any flick starring Brad Dourif has been pretty bad.  Same with that Dan Heyada guy.  Two bad character actors in one movie. Well, Alien Resurrection is not simply a bad movie, it's a stupid one as well.  This time Ripley has been cloned so they scientist can take the alien clone from her body and study it.  this leads to a bunch of aliens running around a space station and a lot of people dying.  Sigourney Weaver is terrible in this movie, as is the supporting cast, including and especially Winona Ryder as a robot. The only scene in this movie that is pretty cool is the underwater scene with the aliens.  If this movie had been more successful in terms of box office figures I am sure we would have had an Alien Five.  Thankfully it's theatrical run lasted  only four weeks so we are spared.  Alien Ressurection gets a &quot;2.0&quot; on the scale.  If you are a fan of the first two movies they can be purchased individually so you don't have to deal with the second two flicks.  This boxed set retails for about $100 so don't waist your hard earned cash on two classics and two bad flicks.
B00008EYA5|2.0|The first hour is a complete tedious snooze.  You know you're in trouble when there's a shot of LL Cool J shopping in a grocery store.  Training, training, TOP GUN-type posturing, training.<br />Michele Rodriguez starts off with the same scowl she's had in every movie I've seen her in, then smiles a couple times in scenes that make me think there might be a love interest--then nothing.  Whatever humanity was hinted at (and there wasn't much, believe me) is quickly jettisoned for the by-the-numbers action scenes.<br />I give it two stars for the action scenes in the last hour, but that's being generous.  No surprises to be found.

It shows the real life retribution for unwanted transgressions beyond one's supposed natural sexuality, not lesbianism represented by two blond, naked, socially constructed beauties, female exhibitionist in a vulgar display for the male voyeur.  What makes this film great is that it dares to defy social stereotypes--it is mainstream (almost) and yet manages to remain entirely subversive.

B00005OAA6|4.0|Don't be fooled by her &quot;name&quot; or the weak first single. It's a good pop-album with steady self-written songs. Her voice is only average but therefore it's Miss Vic. She's really glam
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Can't someone just like listening to a voice and instrument, raw with all its flaws, and enjoy it without all these nitpickers tearing it apart?  Long and Winding Road, and Let It Be, have always been two of my favorite Beatles songs.  I've heard both a thousand times, but never have been moved to tears by them until hearing them on the Naked cd.  There is no wall-of-sound to cover up Paul's quivering voice on Long and Winding Road.  And now Let It Be seems to be speaking to the listener, not just recorded for an audience.  I may not be a music expert, schooled in technique and Beatles history, but a love song sung by Paul without the Specter-hoopla has brought several tears to my eyes lo after all these years.  Don't compare it to the original album.  Buy and enjoy it as a labor of love by true song-writers, the way they sounded in the studio all by themselves.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|I bought a region 2 copy of this DVD and didn't find this one until after I bought an expensive region switcher for my laptop. But, I am sooo glad I found it. It is an AMAZING show. The making of special is also interesting to watch also. Don't worry, it contains English subtitles because it is completely in french. It's very interesting to watch this show after seeing the same thing here in Vegas performed in English. Notre Dame is wonderful........it will always be wonderful. The set rocks too!
0385335482|5.0|I loved it! At first I had my doubts about the book but once getting into it and knowing the characters and most importantly Becky. You grow to love it! Page by page something fun and interesting happens and it all concerns Becky. Whether you like to shop or not, this book is the perfect buy! <br />Happy Reading!
B00005KAQP|5.0|Nothing you can buy could make me tell a lie to my God! This is Whoopi's best movie ever! My cousin and I were constantly singing the songs everywhere we went. One my favorite movies of ALL time. I wish they would come out with a DVD that contained more extra features though.
0684853523|4.0|Stephen King gives us two books in one here, both connected by the overall theme of the writing life. He begins with a memoir of some of the incidents and turning points in his life that shaped him as a writer. The book closes with an account of his near-fatal encounter with an out-of-control van, and a moving discussion of the role writing played in his recovery.<br />In between, we get King's how-to primer for those who want to pursue the writer's trade. He offers the same kind of sound, practical advice that others have offered to aspiring writers: read a lot; write a lot; learn the basic tools of grammar; don't do it for money, or for fame, or for any reason but a need to express yourself. It's this mind-set that he wants to transmit, it seems, above all else.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I haven't read anything by King before this book. Just a few impressions that stick with me: King has a great sense of irony, and a wonderful sense of humor. And he cares passionately about his craft. I think it doesn't matter to him when the critics dismiss him as the modern king of pulp fiction...and it's not a case of him laughing all the way to the bank. As long as he knows, and those who love and value him most know, that he's given his work the very best he's got to offer, he'll be happy with himself.--William C. Hall
B000002KCI|5.0|From a hard core Neil Young fan this is one of my favorite Neil Young albums (along with Everybody Knows this is Nowhere).  Zuma has great songs from start to finish, Neil with his runchy gut felt guitar licks and the feeling that each song was done in one take.  The whole ablum has an energy in every note.  If you are a Neil Young fan and don't have this you are missing out on a truly great ablum
0345451325|4.0|This book was an amazing start to the series.  It gave an enthralling backround to the SPARTAN II project and to the Human-Covenant conflict.  If you own Halo the game this gives you all the backround you need to know to tie up those loose ends.  I recommend reading this book as well as the whole series.  Even if you're not a sci fi type of person, you'll enjoy it because there is still the modern human element underlying through the whole story.
0385504209|2.0|Yes, the storytelling and character development are pedestrian at best, but it seems that those who decry the 'facts' in the book the loudest are those who fear that they may actually be true.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is my best CD!!! If you like Pop/Rock than your serch ends here. It is jumpy in tune and you never know when the song will end. If you want an awsome CD stop here I'm teling you!!!!
0066214122|3.0|Standard boiler plate Crichton.  Again we've got some new interesting technology that escapes our protagonists control and wrecks havoc, teaching us all that there are some things we shouldn't meddle with.<br />Frankly we've read this all before.  From Crichotn and countless other suspense stories.  After reading the first 30 pages or so I got that awful feeling that I could tell exactly where the story was going, and dag gone it if I wasn't right.  Crichton's writing is competant but it felt like his heart wasn't in the project.  There are two suspenseful moments in the story but they could have been more suspensful if we actually cared for the characters involved.  All in all it looks quite obvious that Crichton writes Hollywood screenplays more than a novels these days.<br />Crichton's biggest mistake is relating much of the ending right at the beginning.  By having the main character tell the story to us as if it all happend a few months ago we're alerted to the fact that he's surrvived.  In a paragraph before the novel proper starts, we're even givin a brief glimpse of how the story winds up.  These techniques strip much of the suspense and intrigue from the story.<br />Prey is a very quick and easy read.  A McDonlad's hamburger when I expected a more nutrious meal from this gifted writer.

B00005JMCW|5.0|FREAKY FRIDAY is a movie of revelations.  First, we have the breakout performance for an actress who has always done well, but in this movie, well she finds her niche.  Jamie Lee Curtis is absolutely delightful in the role of Tess Coleman.  She brings a comic ability hardly evidenced in her earlier films; she also has the maturity to cut loose and play her teenage daughter with all the stops pulled out.  If this was a perfect world, Jamie Lee would find herself with a Best Actress oscar nomination this year.  Likewise, Ms. Lindsay Lohan---incredible performance, going from the self-centered teenybopper to the more sophisticated and mature personage of her stressed out mom.<br />Lohan and Curtis work brilliantly together, and in this same perfect world, Lindsay would also be Oscar nominated.<br />Director Mark Waters kept things moving at a frenetic pace, and had me chuckling throughout the movie.  We can't overlook, either, the wonderful actors in their supporting roles:  Mark Harmon was his usual stuffy self, but there was innate warmth lurking there, too; Harold Gould was charming as the hard of hearing grandfather; Ryan Malgarini was perfect as the brother from hell; Dina Spybey was perfect as the too perfect classmate, Stacey; and my favorites:  Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong as the Chinese ladies who get the ball rolling with the switching.  They are so full of life, they give the movie incredible bursts of fun and humor.  Ironically, Chad Michael Murray worked best in his scenes with Jamie Lee; he seemed to have more maturity and self-confidence.<br />This is a very entertaining movie, and in its own way, much better than the original.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND OSCAR DON'T BE SUCH A STUFFSHIRT!
B00008EY7H|5.0|O.K. I love it.    Quidam is my favorite Cirque DVD with Alegria a close second. Varekai I love but the sound is horrible.    But for Alegria the sound and video quality is excellent.    I love how for the filming they placed mini-camcorders on some of the artists.    A journey to Alegria a special is fantastic.    This dosen't have as many features as Varekai but it has a lot.    I have seen Varekai (Live and not live), Mystere (Live), Saltimbanco (Not Live), Cirque Reinvent (Not Live), Nouvelle Experence (Not Live), Quidam (Not Live), Alegria ( Live and Not Live ), And Dralion (Not Live)    So out of all of the Cirque DVDs  I've seen Alegria is second best after Quidam.
0743490304|4.0|After enjoying The Davinci Code I was interested, like most people, to see what else Dan Brown had to offer. Deception Point is the only other book of his that I've read, and I must say, I enjoyed it. You can say what you want about wild, unbelievable plot lines, but whatever you want to call it, Dan Brown weaves it together in such a way that makes the book difficult to put down.<br />The jacket of the book keeps most of the plot line hidden, so I'll do the same in this review. Basically, the novel starts with NASA making a major scientific discovery in the polar ice cap. Certain experts are called in to verify it, and from there we travel on an adventure encompassing geology, astrophysics, political science, marine biology, elite special forces - you name it, it's probably in here - yet the novel doesn't feel crammed with useless facts. He manages to use it all to enrich the plot.<br />The praises are the fast pacing, great tension in practically every scene, characters with interesting histories, and unbelievable research depth. The intricacy with which he covers such things as special forces units and scientific issues rival Clancy and Crichton.<br />Lastly, my biggest criticism with Brown is his dialogue. The Davinci Code was better, but there are moments in Deception Point that are staggeringly awful. Astrophysicists don't say things like \\"Bite me, virgin boy.\\" He had a group of the world's most esteemed scientific researchers speaking to each other like teenagers at a mall.<br />If you like Crichton or Clancy, I can recommend this book to you with confidence. I think Brown is establishing himself as a long-running novelist in the elite ranks of popular fiction writers, and Deception Point is certainly a step in that direction.
006019250X|1.0|You know how teachers at school are supposed to make you want to read but instead 90 percent out of a 100 they give you drop dead boring books.  And then they give me this book and I thought to myself what the heck are they doing are they really trying to make us hate reading I mean for gods sake this book was a real true piece of boring literature.  So what if its about a shepard trying to find his treasure at least from that you could make it some what exciting but no he goes and kills it.  Although he did point out some good themes this book was still pointless.  I dont know one person who has read this book and enjoyed it.
B00005JMCT|3.0|it was amusing, glad I saw it, will get the DVD eventualy, but nothing new.  More of the same situations, lines, and embarrasing moments.  I definatly think I would rate the movies in the series inline with their release (1, 2, then 3 as the worst of the bunch).
B00005JMTQ|4.0|Opening with a highly-concocted, awkward and implausible set of circumstances, it's almost amazing that \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" really does have something to give.<br /> It just takes time, and once the preliminaries are outta the way, the picture becomes a minor treat: romantic, sweet, thoughtful. Diane Keaton shines as a celebrated playwright who's been writing romantic scenes for years but who hasn't kissed a man in a decade; Jack Nicholson is affable and flexible as unfaithful playboy music label exec who learns a little something about love in the later years.<br />It's all frightfully formulaic, and if the plot (nubile-bent, aging Lothario falls for woman his age) is a wee bit implausible, contrived and retro to the urbane comedies of the Hepburn-Tracy era where everyone had lots of money and watered in the best restaurants, we can forgive it. Frankly it's a great relief after years of flying kung-fu bodies and fruit-stand demolishing car chases.<br />Where our oars kick up and catch a few crabs is in the unconvincing love scenes between Keaton and Nicholson. They give it their all but fall a little short of target. Their performances are so strong, however, that once again we are compelled to forgive. We get to see two frames of Diane's (then) 58-year-old body au naturel, quite enough of Jack's butt, and get to hear the prognosis of his little friend, \\"Mr. Midnight.\\"<br />Some of Diane's character's extreme and prolonged emotional tantrums caused me to spot check my wrist-watch. However, if you feel glum about something during this holiday season you could do worse than grabbing some popcorn and watching this one to lift your spirits.<br />It's fun to make-believe, and besides, it's got Jack! Recommended.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is simply the best Disney film - and probably the best film EVER.  If you watch the 2nd DVD in the making of this film, and you realize how much heart and soul went into every second of this picture it will touch you even more.  The music that isn't written by Elton John (beautiful, incredible work by him) is authentic African music, and you can hear it throughout the entire movie - even sometimes just as distant background music.  The message of the movie, and the characters are magical.  I saw this movie in the theatre, and was very touched, but to have it at home - and now see it thru my daughter's eyes makes me realize it is quite possibly the best movie ever
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|This band is one of enormous potential but just as worthy of winces as of emotional outpouring.  Chris Martin is as capable of transcendent moments as he is of head-scratching ponderousness.  But when these guys hit the mark, they are pretty much untouchable.  If See you Soon doesn't convince you of Martins raw songwriting talent than I don't know what to tell you, it goes for a feeling of emptiness and actually conveys it, its a remarkably coherent beautiful song, and probably the best song on here, one of the first songs they released, don't know what that says.  The rest is a mixed bag to me, Shiver was always a song that you remember being better than it is, Yellow is a song that hasn't aged well to me, but Clocks, Politik, and God Put a Smile Upon your Face all benefit from muscular arrangements live, and really dare I say rock out.  I never got the Radiohead comparisons myself, Radiohead were never this literal, this bare, instead opting for the cryptic and abstract save a few songs like TLW and Creep, not a criticism by any means, but just an observation.  In all, this is a solid release, because these songs do grow on you, and the musical and songwriting skill on display when it works is really something to behold in mainstream music today...
6305327041|5.0|What the heck is this?<br />That was my first question when my erstwhile sidekick and chum brought this movie into our home as a rental. I had never heard of this flick. Neither had my wife. In fact, he had rented it on the strength of a recommendation of a friend. So, with no expectations or preconceptions to color our views, we set about to watch this thing.<br />One great advantage to having no particular expectation of an unknown film is that our ignorance led to bliss. Before the end of the film, we were literally roaring with laughter. Not mere chortles, mind you, nor the odd guffaw that may accompany an isolated humorous incident, but laughing at scene after scene as the movie progressed.<br />This is an episodic comedy that has Tim Roth as a bellman at a Hollywood hotel working alone on New Years Eve. He becomes  involved in 4 different sketches. Each one just a wee-bit more madcap than the last. From being seduced by a Coven of Witches in the first sketch, to a bizarre couple who play dangerous games in the second, to misbehaving children in the 3rd, to an unexpected and hilarious ending in the 4th, one simply never knows what is coming next. Nothing is predictable, and along the way, our hero (or antihero) encounters a splendidly malevolent Antonio Banderas, quirky Quentin Tarantino, and a surprising appearance by Bruce Willis.<br />There is much to be said for this film, but I would not wish to spoil things by giving too much away. I believe the best way to see this film is as we did. Just get it, watch it, and let it impress itself upon you in all its bizarre glory.<br />Very few films made today are as funny, or as quirky, or offbeat, or simply hilarioius as this film. My wife has a sister in the hotel/hospitality business, and we plan to present this one to her as a gift. They have seen strange things in the hotel business, and so will you when you watch this film. Great Stuff!!!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Yeah, I used to drive like those masterminds in their Mini Coopers. I'm glad I'm not the only one who drives through undergrounds and speed through traffic by going on the wrong side of the road. But, I guess they had a good reason to drive recklessly... \\"The Italian Job\\" stars Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Donald Sutherland. It's supposedly a remake of an old Michael Caine movie, but who cares about that when you have a great cast like this! They stole some gold in Italy (duh) and their leader (Sutherland) was double-crossed by the slimy Steve (Norton). Now Charlie (Wahlberg) and friends had to get their gold back and cash it in. Spend it wisely. I'm talking about stereo systems that are so loud that they can blow women's clothes off and a room full of shoes! This is a great movie!
B0000VAFO0|3.0|It could have been so much better.  Good special effects, a quite decent concept, good actors, good sets and backgrounds, in general a great feeling to the movie, but the plot suffered a little.  My main complaint was that of charater development, especialy regarding the 2 leads whom were supposed to have some sort of emotional attachment/connection.  The problem was that they never spent enough time, or dialog, together to develop the bonds that were needed by the end to explaine the things.  She was supposed to fall head-over heels for him, give up all she was raised to belive, etc, etc, etc, (don't want to ruin too much if you haven't seen it yet), yet I think she spent more screen time walking though doorways (entrances and exits) than she did with the other romantic lead.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale in tight leather walking away from the camra as much as the next guy, and I look forward to timming things out when I get the DVD, its just with a little better editing and the addition of a scene or two this movie could have been one of the better ones, and deffinatly would have gottne another star.
B00005JMGC|2.0|A movie that aspires to be about the perils of conformity. Quite ironically then,  the performances range from conventional (Roberts) to dreadful, and the script is as shallow as your latest Aguilera number.<br />Our heroine is Kate Watson, from California -- where else?! -- who arrives in 1953 at Wellsley college to teach art history. Soon she collides with a conservative institution that's mass-assembling young women to be the obedient objects they were meant to be.<br />Kate, in a very Robin Williams fashion but without half as much pizzazz, tries to open the eyes of the women to the vistas of possibilities, to Van Gogh, and all that maverick jazz. Alas, the women are into girdles and matrimony. Perfectly predictably, Kate then falls prey to ad hominem when she is labeled as the \\"progressive\\" threat around campus.<br />Roberts is no feast in this flat role, and the slapdash cinematography doesn't really help. Just another chick- flick masquerading as social commentary. Skippable.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Let me start off by prefacing that I am a huge britney fan. I have all her CDs.  But I gotta say that this album is pretty mediocre.  I have heard the album about 5 times and there are a few gems.  The obvious one being &quot;Me against the music&quot;.  Others include &quot;Breathe on me&quot; and &quot;Boom Boom&quot;.  The remainder of songs are average at best.  I find that I will often skip alot of the other songs on the ablum.  I believe that most Non-Britney fans will likely be quite disappointed in the album.  Really wish I could give it a higher rating but I am honestly disappointed in the album overall.<br />Hopefully the next album will be back up to Britneys usual high standards.  Rock on!!
0385504209|2.0|A pot-boiler of the second order.... Plot driven!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin pretty much offered fans more of the same great blues songs as their debut as they did on their second album. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" starts the album with one heck of a driving rhythem and some spectacular vocals by Plant. \\"The Lemon Song\\" is an almost folky rocker, \\"Heartbreaker\\" has one of the best intro's in rock. \\"Living Loving Maid\\" is an almost bouncy blues hit. \\"Moby Dick\\" is also another awsome instrumental song. \\"Ramble On\\" shows Led Zeppelin at their most heaviest, and my personal favorite \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" has great lyrics and great sounding rhythem. Led Zeppelin II is equally as good as their debut and it showed alot of progression in writing songs that rock as hard as Led Zeppelin should be.
0345440900|5.0|Wished I'd had this book with my first child!  I read it just before having my second child and found it to be very accurate and helpful when it came to feeding and sleeping schedules.  It was my bible for setting schedules and reading my baby for signs of tiredness or hunger. My baby did not fall into any one particular type, but the book gave me the confidence to do the &quot;right thing&quot; for baby and family. My baby was sleeping through the night by 9 weeks, and was very content and predictable when it came to eating and napping.  She's 18 months old today and I still recommend this book to new moms.  I followed the EASY plan after going back to work at 10 weeks, which made everything easier for us and the baby sitter.  We maintain a &quot;Nanny Log&quot; to this day - I can't say enough great things about what this book did for our baby and family!  Colic - we didn't have the misfortune of dealing with that.  So, for those parents (and babies) I say - time will heal.  In the meantime, take a look at this book and use what you can....
B00005JLPK|3.0|Hats off to Salma Hayek for creating an interesting vehicle for her good talent, an effort that is a visual treat. But that doesn't save the script, unfortunately, from being the linear soapy exposition that it is -- a chronology of events not even woven into a plot. Nor did Frida offer its audience substance beyond the visual presentation.<br />The protagonist was into the early communist movement, for example, but there is not enough of a hint of why this was so. This also holds for her slightly better known husband, the early 20th Century Mexican painter Diego Rivera.<br />Scenes open and close like soldiers passing by in a parade. A film worth making should be based on a meaningful and significant scenario. Frida is a laundry list abstract of the little-known painter's life and because it is not well written it will more than likely be quickly forgotten. If the script is not there, the legs will not be there.<br />That said, there are some marvelous graphic elements in the film that while not seminal delight the eye while a wonderful Hispanic music score and its on-camera performers warm the heart.<br />A case of missed opportunities, but a watchable far if only for the visuals.

B00005JM02|1.0|How can people continue to lap up this drivel?  Another feel good movie about a poor little tyke who manages to, against incredible odds, rise above it all and save/inspire everyone!!!  Now, I will admit that my 10 year old like it.  But she's 10!<br />The story line is so old.  And I'm sick of movies that Anthropomorphize animals.  They are so beautiful and aweinspiring in their own right.  To learn about salt water fish, take your kids to a good aquarium and teach them what animals are really like, and what they truly need to survive:  a clean ocean.
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses Of The Holy is awsome, beautiful, enchanting, rocking, dancable, and cool all at the same time. &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; is unlike any Zeppelin song prior, with its mystic lyrics and almost jazzy rythem. &quot;The Rain Song&quot; is Zeppelin at their most breezy and mellow. &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away&quot; is an awsome song with some cool bass parts by John Paul Jones. &quot;The Crunge&quot; is a jazz and funk song written by John Bonham. &quot;Dancing Days&quot; is their most dancable yet. &quot;No Quarter&quot; is almost spooky rock, which possibly influenced some of Tool's music, and &quot;The Ocean&quot; is a great sounding song to end the album.  Houses Of The Holy remains to be my favorite album by Led Zeppelin. Totally rocking all the way through.
6304383177|5.0|Undeniably Hawks was no deep like C.T.Dreyer, no epic like Ejzenstein, no original like Bunuel, no intense like Bresson, but this movie is the most perfect i've ever seen...
0375703764|5.0|Let me first start by saying that you don't initially read \\"House of Leaves\\" - you experience it.  Pick a copy of it at your local library or bookstore and thumb through it.  Then you will understand.     It is likely that you have never read anything like the way this novel is constructed and that you likely have never 'experienced' a literary style like Mark Danielewski's.  Like it or hate it (there is no middle ground) you will find yourself drawn into discussions/debates with anyone you find who has also read and experienced this book.    The storyline unfolds when the protagonist Johnny Truant discovers notes to manuscript belonging to a deceased, blind tenant in an apartment.  As he begins to put the notes together the uncompleted manuscript begins to tell a seemingly surreal story of a photojournalist who moves into a house that slowly begins to manifest supernatural characteristics.  Then a second story develops within the book's footnotes (and there are many, many footnotes) which begins to describe the changes happening to Johnny Truant as he becomes obsessed with the manuscript.    \\"House of Leaves\\" is not a easy read but will highly reward those with the perseverance to stick it out.
B00004RFFS|4.0|After watching this movie I read some of the reviews that said this movie was boring or simply bad - just out of curiosity. And all of them had one thing in common. They said that it wasn't a good horror movie. <br />Indeed, this is not much of a horror movie. <br />It was never intended to be. <br />Making it into a horror movie would be an insult to the book, which was sensual, intensive and (a bit sloppily, I must admit) philosophical. That is much more than can be said for horror movies. The movies that manage to be this just don't fit the box anymore. And it is ridiculous to call them bad just because they do not fit certain standards or expectations. <br />The actors were great, although the full potential of Banderas was not taken advantage of. Kirsten Dunst astonished me - a child with the ability to play such a complicated role seemed impossible to be, yet here she was, as good as her co-stars Pitt and Cruise, who were simply stunning. What was missing in the movie was the chilling cruelty of the child, Claudia, which was certainly the most frightening aspect of the book - in the movie she just seems a lost little girl, growing into a teenage girl, not a woman, really - but this is not the fault of the actress, certainly.<br />If I could change a few things in the movie, these would be: 1) making Claudia seem more like the cold-blooded doll she was in the book, 2) using the charisma and mysterious nature of Banderas to its full potential, and 3) changing the scenes that take place in the modern times - these, I feel, lack the style and taste of the rest of the movie, especially the end, which was so typically Holywood I positively hated it.<br />This movie, however, was a fine one. It was desperate, sensual, erotic and very aesthetically pleasing - more than I expected. <br />The beauty of the human body. Incomparable, indeed.
0385504209|5.0|Simply Amazing!  Not only is this book a wonderfully suspenseful novel including puzzles, codes, and twisty plot guaranteed to entice the reader, it is all centered around a basic set of facts that challenge everything you ever knew about the roots of the christian religion and ancient history.  If you are interested in art history, religion, secret societies, or anything of the like, this is a must read.  I highly recommend this novel. It only takes a day or two to finish, so why not give it a spin?
B000002J1U|5.0|On Led Zeppelin III the band showed a great deal of progression. With the opening stomp of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; which has some crazy riffs and some mean AAaaa AAaa's by Robert Plant. &quot;Friends&quot; is the first sign of Zeppelin testing new waters in their songs. &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; is an epic ballad. &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot;, &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; the beautifully written &quot;Tangerine&quot;, the bluesy affair of &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; and the cool closer &quot;Hats Off To Roy Harper&quot;. Led Zeppelin did not get much credit from the critics no matter what they did, but I know and the fans know and Led Zeppelin defiently knew that an album like this would give the critics something to talk about.

B000050XEI|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this album is way too short. I just bought it recently, and I like almost every track. But I find myself drawn into a song, just for it to end way too quickly. Even if she did not have more songs to put on here, at least lengthen the songs. With another minute or two added to each song, it would not have gone stale. I find that there are various different sounds on this album, so having such short tracks makes it sound cut up, rather than flowing smoothly like her other cds (I didn't even realize those are all only about 40 min). When I listen to the cd, I keep imagining they're samples and I'll be able to buy the actual songs later...and then I realize these ARE the actuals songs. Even cds from the 70's are not this short. 35 min is about half an album these days.  Oh well...it's still a great cd that's definitely worth owning. Its only crime is that it keeps you begging for more.
B000002NE4|5.0|Another amazing Nick album. One to be heard over and over again. He's a favorite artist for any one who knows really good music and talent.
B000002J09|5.0|It all came together on Led Zeppelin IV. There is no need to point out any flaws because there are none. &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock N Roll&quot;, &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot;, &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Misty Mounatin Hop&quot;, &quot;Four Sticks&quot;, &quot;Going To California&quot; and the excellence of &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot;. Thats it, those are all of the songs on the album, and all of the songs are pure genious. There is no use really giving it more credit because the fans already know that this is one of the greatest rock records in the history of mankind. And if you don't, well its a dam shame.

0553565915|5.0|I was handed Betty's book when my 18 year old daughter was diagnosed 'brain dead' after a car accident.  I have given the book out to others who have experienced a loss in their life and will continue passing out Betty's book of hope after death!<br />The book explained a little about what happened to me when I was clinically dead from an injury in an accident, 1980.  Although I didn't see anyone, I remember being in a beautiful green pasture with flowers and the feeling of total love, peace and harmony.  It was a place I never wanted to leave!<br />My mother had a NDE when my little sister died.  She remembers being in a beautiful place floating with an angel or guide as Betty describes.  She then asked about her baby and was able to see her baby flying around very peaceful and happy.  My mother said &quot;she doesn't know me&quot; and was told &quot;she will when she grows up.&quot;  Thus, I have always felt babies grow in heaven.<br />My daughter's best friend was struck by a truck and in a coma for months.  When she awoke from her brain injury, she was recovering in a rehab center for months.  The first words she spoke was seeing her grandparents - who had died several years before.  Four months after her accident, she was allowed to go home for a few hours to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner.  She saw a picture of Jesus on the dining room wall, not able to talk well or use her arms to function, she pointed to the picture and said &quot;uh, uh, no, he doesn't look like that -- Jesus doesn't look like that.&quot;  These were the only words she spoke during her brief visit.<br />I can go on and on about other people who have had NDE and I have no doubt we all of have destiny beyond this world!  As for my daughter, she is in a much better place.  I know because I was there once and look forward to returning to Heaven when my time is up!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Let's face it: there are few movies in which the music is noted. We occassionally hum Star Wars or Titanic under our breaths, but that's basically it. Not only is LotR a spectacular movie trilogy, its score is oustanding and definitely will be remembered for years to come. It's at the top of the ranks in movie music.<br />The Return of the King soundtrack incorporates many of the tunes we love from FotR and TTT, yet Shore manages to alter them slightly, use different instruments (Sir James Galaway is amazing on the flute), play them in a different key...so you pay attention to the details. And there are the new things he adds - the powerful Gondor theme, the dark tunes of &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot;, and much more. <br />One other thing I enjoyed was the fact that Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd contributed to this soundtrack. Although both parts were rather short, they were each exquisitely beautiful. It's nice to know that not only do they give splendid performances onscreen, they can also lend a tune to the soundtrack. <br />Annie Lennox's &quot;Into the West&quot; is strange to the ears at first - what is a guitar doing in Middle-Earth? But the lyrics and tune are so beautiful that soon the instrumentals are forgotten. It's not gushy mushy like &quot;May It Be&quot;, nor creepy like &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; (although that song does fit Gollum extremely well). &quot;Into the West&quot; is, in my opinion, a perfect way to end the soundtrack and trilogy. <br />Overall, this CD is brilliant and you will find yourself playing it over and over again. Howard Shore is an absolute genius. Just hear for yourself.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I have been along time punk/emo and indie fan..I was in hot topic one day and saw this album in the listening station..<BR>listened to it,thought hey they sound pretty good,they wanna call themselves hardcore punk/thats fine with me,they're a little hardrock/metal/punk/screamo whatever you wanna label them,<BR>damn they're good..they brought me into the metal/screamo world of music..the way they mix sceaming with clean lyrics,absolutely perfect..listen to chapter four song 3 and you'll be in awe<br />how can someone make such a perfect song,its been my favorite this whole year..I highly recommend..<BR>if you like poison the well,atreyu,soilwork,a static lullaby<BR>or the whole metalcore/screamo with a fine blend of clean lyrics..you'll fall in love with this band and this album..
0767805712|5.0|That's my favorite line in the movie where Uma Thurman's character says &quot;Not so long, just once around the sun.&quot; Referring to how long a year away from Ethan she will be. When I saw this film I was in science class, and the teacher said we were going to be watching a movie, I was excited but not so excited because all the movies we watch in school suck...but this one was great! I loved it instantly. The music is the best in this movie! The film is brilliantly done, &quot;visionary&quot; and the dialogue is great also. I think its the most perfect science fiction film, but I wouldn't just categorize it as a sci fi but more as a drama or love story.
B00008EYA5|4.0|&quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; wasn't the first TV show I thought that would make a succesful transition to the big screen, but after watching the movie, how wrong I was.  Unlike a good amount of the summer action movie crop, this actioner actually had something most of them didn't have: regard for human life (and in the case of &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, death).  Unlike the cartoonish mayhem of &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, we have situations where cops HAVE to deal with the consequences of their actions.  As the film opens, Jim Street (played by Colin Farrell) has been disgraced by the actions of his former partner during a brutal bank robbery and seems to be out of L.A's S.W.A.T. for good.  However, redemption comes in the form of Sgt. Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson), who is assembling his own S.W.A.T. unit, made up of a ragtag pack of officers (LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Brian Van Holt, Josh Charles).  No sooner do they earn their stripes as a unit, they end up being put in charge of taking a drug kingpin (Oliver Martinez) to federal prison.  That's easier said than done, when said druglord declares he'll give $100 million to whoever frees him from custody.  Suffice to say, it gets hairy from there.  The ensemble cast here is definitely having fun, and it shows.  The direction by Clark Johnson (who directed several episodes of &quot;The Shield&quot;, including its shocking first episode) keeps things moving through the first 90 minutes or so, but things do get a little sluggish near the end.  However, it's still worth a rental (even despite the PG-13 rating for such a rough and tumble film like this) and the special features aren't all bad either.  Recommended.
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Adrian Lyne is truely a master at exploiting human emotions. In  this powerful movie he adds the bonus of 'easy money' in the form of one million dollars to a stuggling couple if the lady is willing to spend just one night with him.. We are all to assume that one night is all the billionaire really wants. \\"The night will come and go but the money could last a lifetime\\" he explains, but in a true Coen brothers twist, money proves to be the root of all evil. The irony being, that once the night passes, and the relationship deteriorates, neither of them want the money. The only real flaw in the movie is the fact that neither member of this relatively intelligent couple are able to see what the billionaires alterior motive is. <BR>All through this movie I kept wondering what I would do in the same situation. Now I'm not married but maybe if I were I would look at it differently but right now, I would probably take the money. The reason being that I think I'm mature and responsible enough to deal with it.... But then again, dont we all.
B000002UC5|5.0|if you dont know what &quot;macca&quot; stands for you might not like this album as much as those who do.  I love this album...but then again, I know what &quot;macca&quot; stands for.
B000094DUP|3.0|I am reviewing this artist and her album honestly! I am a fan of Delta Goodrem. In Australia, the year 2003 will be remembered as the year of Delta, for she achieved great success professionally and personally. She broke the cynicism with her groundbreaking debut album. And reassured us that Neighbours-actress-turned-singer¡¯s were not just one-hit singers like Holly Valance, but songwriters who can achieve longevity. Also in December her health improved and it seems her treatment for Hodgkin¡¯s disease was successful. <br />¡°Innocent Eyes¡± won 7 ARIA Awards (Australia¡¯s answer to the Grammy¡¯s and American Music Awards); she won another award from ARIA just recently for the album with the longest period on the number 1 spot. Beating the BEATLES! She¡¯s a lovely and kind person to her fans and is really down to earth. Her fans heavily support her: all 5 singles have reached the number one spot. <br />So what do I think of the album? I think it¡¯s a solid Pop/Rock debut, which brings comparisons with Mariah Carey¡¯s debut. But it does contain some mediocre songs. Her song writing abilities are good! Can¡¯t be compared to Jill Scott or Lauryn Hill, but is similar to Alicia Keys, Michelle Branch and definitely kills the fake Avril Lavigne. Most of her songs are piano driven and are co-written, but she does shine on the self-written and produced songs ¡°Will You Fall For Me¡±, and the uplifting ode to adolescence growth ¡°In My Own Time¡±. <br />Her single are¡­ no. 1, ¡°Born To Try¡± is inspiring and uplifting but it lacks depth in soul. ¡°Lost Without You¡± is so catchy and emotional, it¡¯s one of the only songs not written/co-written by Delta. ¡°Innocent Eyes¡± is a catchy Pop song ¨Cwith an interesting theme ¨Csome people say it¡¯s autobiographical, but I wouldn¡¯t go that far. With that single, Delta broke records! She became the first Australian female artist who achieved all number ones on her first three singles. Then it was the emotional and empowering ¡°Not Me, Not I¡±, Delta states it was about her first break up. Another #1. <br />The rest of the album lacks the brilliance of the singles, but ¡°Butterfly¡± is something that Celine would kill for, and so is ¡°A Year Ago Today¡± ¨CDelta¡¯s vocals fail on that one. And ¡°Longer¡± is as Britney as this album gets. <br />The boring and mediocre are: ¡°Throw It Away¡±, ¡°Running Away¡± & ¡°This Is Not Me¡±. <br />But the best song is the darker, edgier and sexier ¡°Predictable¡± part A of single number 5. At first I thought it was an attempt to sell the whole album out, but I now believe it is a good choice of a single. The song was sung on Australian Idol (Judges¡¯ Wild Card Show) and got Cosima de Vito into the Top 12. Cosima missed the Idol crown, but was place Top 3, just after Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll. Cosima was the number one female out of the six.  <br />The single also features the Christmas single: ¡°Merry X-Mas (War Is Over)¡± the cover of the John Lennon-Yoko song. It also features a remix of the old Delta Goodrem song: ¡°Here I Am¡± which featured on her real debut single ¡°I Don¡¯t Care¡±, Sony Music¡¯s attempt to turn Delta into the Australian Britney, but fortunately failed! ¡°Predictable/Merry X-Mas¡± single reached number one only three weeks after its release, at first it was unable to beat Guy Sebastian¡¯s debut single, but succeeded in the end! <br />Delta also released a DVD simply entitled ¡°Delta¡±, it includes all 7 of her videos ~ first release ¡°I Don¡¯t Care¡±, 2nd debut ¡°Born To Try¡±, ¡°Lost Without You¡±, ¡°Innocent Eyes¡±, ¡°Not Me, Not I¡± and the unreleased ¡°A Year Ago Today¡±. The ¡°Predictable¡± video-clip is found in the LIVE section. The DVD also includes plenty and I mean plenty bonuses. From LIVE, to Back-Stage, to EPK! <br />I gave this album a 3/5, even though it has brilliant singles and is a great Pop debut which defines Delta as a person and artiste, it lacks innovation and depth. But I¡¯m excited because Delta said that her next release at the end of 2004 will include more darker emotional songs written during her battle against cancer.
B000069AUI|5.0|Their songs on this CD are so good. I remember Coldplay from their annoying song, &quot;Yellow&quot; and I really didn't like them at all, but then I saw their song &quot;Clocks&quot; and I loved it. THEN! I heard the song &quot;The Scientist&quot; and I was like ok they are good musicians!!!! so I went and bought the album and cursed the day I said they suck, because their songs on this CD are so addicting and wonderful! Its a GREAT CD!!
630512762X|5.0|I haven't seen many movies like Face-off, especially with its original plotline and all-star cast of characters.  John Travolta and Nicholas Cage team up in what could be the best acting jobs by both of them.  Cage starts off in the beginning as the villain and Travolta the good guy.  After their faces are switched, then they reverse roles.  Before this movie was released I know some people had been skeptical towards Travolta playing a villain. We're all used to seeing him play good guy characters with morals (i.e. Phenomenon, Michael, etc.).  I'm sure he put those ballots to rest because he did a tremendous job as the villian.  Cage also did a good job the short time he played the villian and did an even better job as the hero.  The plot is powerful throughout the whole movie and keeps you motivated to keep watching.  You have to see it to believe it, and I recommend this movie to everyone.
B000001YOW|1.0|Being a big fan of prog-metal, and some prog-rock, I must say this was the stupidest excuse for music I have ever heard.  If you like bands such as DT or even Spock's Beard, you'll be  dissapointed.  I have heard good things about this band, but they were obviously bias views.  The entire album is eerie sound effects, that don't even come close to giving you that feeling of pure enjoyment.  Music to me consists of a band utilizing their skills in song writing and playing their instruments, not making random creepy symphonic sounds with some lyrics.  Only if you're interested in the traits in which I listed, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney's sophomore album is really good. I would give it five stars but I just can't bring myself to give any of her work five stars. That would be equating her music with others who are real musicians. And this little lip synching, lying, cheating witch doesn't deserve it. But Oops! is jam-packed with upbeat songs that are pretty enjoyable.<br />1. Oops! I Did It Again - 8/10<BR>2. Stronger - 9/10<BR>3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door - 9 1/2 / 10<BR>4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - 8/10<BR>5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - 7 1/2 / 10<BR>6. What U See (Is What U Get) - 8/10<BR>7. Lucky - 10/10<BR>8. One Kiss From You - 9/10<BR>9. Where Are You Now - 8/10<BR>10. Can't Make You Love Me - 10/10<BR>11. When Your Eyes Say It - 4/10<BR>12. Dear Diary - 1/10<br />The last two songs shouldn't even be on here. ZZZZZZZ. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know was produced by Shania Twain's husband/producer Mutt Lange. You can really tell. It would've been better if Shania or another country singer had've recorded it. Overall, this album is artistically better than Baby One More Time and it's the perfect follow up.
0800141660|5.0|This film is a stroke of genius!  It is more than a bunch guys in tights and speaking really long, boring dialogue.  Jane Austen's classic was brought to life in an extraordinary way, so well that even guys like it!  This brilliant romantic comedy has won my heart with wonderful actors, like Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, and Kate Winslet.  Excellent!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Whoa is all I can say, this movie really blew my mind! It looked like a vary different movie and I was unsure id like it, to tell you the truth I had to watch the movie twice to understand it all. Then I watched the commentary, and then fully understood the movie. It not only has a great cast, and story, but really good acting. I thought it was funny when Drew Barrymore's character say that cellar door is the most beautiful word in the English language, not knowing that she's leading Donnie towards his fate.......It was a great movie with a lot of twists and I would recommend it to science fiction fans everywhere!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Britney's fourth album and the best. I enjoyed listening to practically all of the songs on it. This album displays a more mature side of her. Most songs on her album are very catchy and fun to dance to except for Shadow and Everytime which are ballads. My favourite songs on the album are MATM, Toxic, Everytime and Outrageous. It seems like she has put a lot of effort to bring out the best of her in this album. Britney is the best entertainer in the world!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I agree with others that this album definitely is not up to DT par, but it has potential.  They simply need to take out the moments where it gets lame, like the rapping section on the 4th track, or the lame keyboard/techno sounds on tracks 4 and 7.  If you could just eliminate these small parts, it would make the album much better.  The only track I must say is truly unbelievable is the instrumental piece called, &quot;Stream of Conciousness.&quot;  This track has the old fashioned formula that has worked in the past: odd time, various groove sections, solos by each member, and NO LAME KEYBOARD OR VOCALS.  I think in order for this band to succeed, they have got to stick to what has worked in the past.  Train of Thought to me was more of an experiment in the realms of metal. This somewhat failure may actually help them learn and grow from their mistakes and help produce future masterpieces.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|The record is great. &quot;Masters of War&quot; is a timeless song that can be used today to protest. I bow to Mr. Dylan.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is a great CD.''White Flag'' is the greatest.I mean this is the one that started it all for me.But i can't help to compare Dido and Sarah Mclachlan.Their voices are so simliar because when i first heard Dido i thought it was Sarah!But it's not a bad comparison because i think Sarah is a great singer.I seriously think Dido and Sarah should do a duet!It would be so great and I would probably be one of the 1st to buy it.So i think Dido is a wonderful singer and u should really consider adding her to your collection!
B000002H72|5.0|This album is a classic. The pixies changed musicians view of music forever. They have inspired many modern day bands. This is the most famous of their albums, mostly because it contains the popular &quot;here comes your man&quot;. If you have never heard the pixies before, you will be very surprised. They are incredibly unique and seem to be able to create the most amazing sounds which will make you go &quot;I didnt know a guitair could do that&quot;. <BR>Their is a strong punk influence here as well as some other strong 70s influences, like David Bowie. 15 years after it's original release and it still sounds fresh, if you like grunge, you'll probably like the pixies, they were a sort of &quot;pre-grunge&quot; band.<br />The pixies was the high point in both black francis' (now frank black) and kim deal's (of the breeders) career and neither have them has since topped it and probably never will. If you are a fan of the breeders or frank black, you will love this CD.
B00005JMGL|5.0|This film was absolutely perfect!My sister and I loved it!<BR> Jeremy Sumter flew away with our hearts! Compared to the movie Hook, we thought it was extremley better. (We've seen it twice and would see it again,) Wendy, her family, tink<BR>and the lost boys contributed towards the movie also. We thought Wendy was just first class as Slightly would say. Two of our favorite lost boys were Slightly, and Nibs they were delightfully hilarious! The mermaids on the other hand were frightfully scary and made us cringe! We were glad that there was chemistry between Peter and Wendy. <BR> Not to be forward but we think Jeremy Sumter is beyond gorgeous! I would recommend this film to anybody! This is a movie to see with friends and family.
B0000399WI|4.0|Great story, nigh great acting, and all the rest of great words you read about this movie are by and large true.... Yet, I take one (big) exception with this movie and interrupt the series of great qualifiers by asking: How could the hair style and physiognomy of the main two characters stay the same over 20 years of prison time? Had Frank Darabont (the film director) run out of make-up professionals at the time? I found this flaw distracting enough to make me withhold one star for this otherwise excellent production.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD very much.  I was especially happy that the CD came with it.  One thing that I noticed was how much more aggressive they sound live.  Never did I realize how Pink Floyd-ish the song A Rush of Blood to the head was.  Also surprising was the improvised version of Trouble during sound check in the tour diary.  Great job, but the only complaints I have are that they left out some of the songs from the DVD on the CD, and that they showed a little too much of Chris Martin.  It would have been nice to see everyone else do their thing too.
B00005JMGL|5.0|The movie was outstanding. The on screen chemistry between Peter and Wendy was absoulutly wonderful. I can't tell you how many times I've seen the play and read the book. They did a wonderful job of bringing the story of Peter Pan to life.
1400031354|5.0|THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY was a rare surprise, an entertaining mystery story written in the graceful voice of literary fiction.  Does its sequel, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE hold up, now that we know about the surprises?  You bet.  Probably the best compliment that can be paid this novel is that although it is a sequel, it stands on its own quite well.<br />TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE carries on the story of Mma Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency in Botswanna, Africa.  Once again, Alexander McCall Smith paints an evocative picture of a stable African state that has achieved its independence and modernity after a long journey through colonial rule and early selfhood.  In Mma Ramotswe and her fiancé, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, Smith has an honest lens on the traditional and emerging cultures that still clash, but are determined to reckon with one another.  This time out, their stories convey not only Africa, but a bemused look at its foil, America, when Mma Ramotswe agrees to go looking for the answer to an American woman's question: why and where did her college-aged son disappear 10 years before.<br />Unlike the first book, which unfolded episodically, this has two strong plot lines from the outset with attendant subplots.  It is to Mr. Smith's credit, that he prefers complications in plot and character rather than red herrings.  He employs both irony and symbolism, but in an almost self-effacing way that make their revelation richer.  He knows when to let the reader laugh and when to ask tricky ethical questions.
0451457994|5.0|2001: A Space Odyssey was an incredible work of science fiction. While I was reading this book I could not put it down. The characters seemed so real to me. You should read this book. Also read its sequel 2010: Odyssey Two. Incredible book!
6303823351|2.0|Especial fans of the Beatles should find this mildly entertaining or at least tolerable. Non-Beatles fans had better avoid it. The Beatle songs are among their pre-psychedelic best. The design of the Beatles's fictional abode is appealing in its wacky way. The Beethoven's ninth symphony scene is original. Everything else is tired, tedious, and heavy-handed. The big-band-arrangement score is particularly tasteless; George Martin is sorely missed. (Director Richard Lester so harrassed George Martin on the set of &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, for the score of which George Martin won an academy award, that George Martin refused to have anything to do with &quot;Help!&quot;) About the title song: For the first Beatles movie Richard Lester found the title &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; in John Lennon's book, &quot;In His Own Write&quot;, and asked Lennon to write a song called &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. Paul McCartney was jealous. When he heard the working title of the follow-up Beatles film, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, he immediately set to work pre-emptively composing the song &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;. Richard Lester eventually decided to call it &quot;Help!&quot; and again approached Lennon. (Sorry, Paul.)
B00001PE4D|5.0|CRUEL INTENTIONS is about how some troubled youths act in high school, both in the movie, and in reality as well. This movie is great, it is aimed for a teen audience, but is still entertaining. It is almost repulsing when you see how these shmucks treat each other, but then you can see the connections between the Character partrayed by Sarah and Ryan, and the kids at your high school. Insomse cases it hit pretty close to home, but it is refreshing to see the \\"just desarts\\" in the end of this movie. Sarah Michelle Gellar found her inner \\"Erica Kane\\" from her All My Children days. I say her inner \\"Erica Kane\\" 'cause I cannot type the real word on this review. In the movie, you almost want to slap her in you are a girl, or splash a glass of water in her face if are a guy,'cause you can't slap her if are a guy. Sarah Michelle Gellar uses some strong language in this movie, so do teens today. Which is so realistic about this movie, with their language and their actions If want to see some evil teens try to use and abuse and manipulate eac other(with thier \\"Just Desarts\\" in the end) then sit down, kick  back and enjoy!!!
0385504209|4.0|Where to start?<br /><br />  I've decided to begin by &quot;taking out the trash&quot;. I, for one, am sick of these bad reviewers blaming the author for &quot;accusing&quot; and &quot;harassing&quot; the Catholic Church. I even heard one reviewer claim all of his books were anti-Catholic! Obviously, someone read TWO out of his FOUR books, and took them the wrong way. When are these people going to learn that the author didn't invent these theories! That's like reading a biography about a terrible person and then blaming the author for the things that went wrong! He's just writing about one idea! And on the reviewers that claimed he was bad-mouthing the church for the molestation charges? He had NO implications on such things, and only mentioned the incidents in one line, where a guard was remembering the police chief's statement about the church! GIVE ME A BREAK! I also heard people blaming him for goals of national paranoia? Is this the Twilight Zone? My advice to people trying to understand what the book is really like is this: Ignore the truly paranoid people who can't go on with their lives ignoring a &quot;bad&quot; idea let alone consider it and look for REAL reviews (AKA positive criticism on the more important criteria of the book). Talk about stubborn! Now that we have that out of the way, let us continue.<br />  Whether the theory is real or not, I find it unimportant. People are also acting like this is the first book of it's kind. Wrong! You'd be interested how much you'd find out the book is more non-fictional past the author's claims just by reading the first chapter of a certain book (that's all you need, but you might as well read the whole thing).<br />  If you're starting give-up on this review, hear this. This book is not a novel or a thriller, if that's what you're trying to avoid. It's an informational book. The character Jacques Sauniere is also more real then you may have thought, and other character names and places in DVC are all names for other things that played huge roles in the original unearthing of this theory like mountain chains, factual people, and towns. This book is also good for mentioning one thing DVC did not about this subject: the large role in early cryptography. The book is called, &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Very awe inspiring performance<br />Ravi's daughter is also a ripper!<br />Full of great songs.<br />The entire concert DVD is the best of the 2.<br />Worth the money for sure.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Brit's best album yet thus far. Brit totally has what it takes to be the next Madonna and is givig that Chistina chick a run for her money. While, Christina is out there talkting trash and being immature, Britney is out there baring her soul in some songs on this album and Chistina is just out there baring her body.<BR>[I'm not saying that Britney always wares alot of cloths, but more than Christina]No, seriously, Brit does actually have some  heart-felt songs on this album. There  are these for example:<BR>TOXIC-\\" ...and I love what you do/but you that your toxic\\" Perhaps  about a certin \\"Justified\\" ex-boyfriend<BR>EVERYTIME-\\"Everytime I see you in my dreams/I see your face haunting me..\\" Again, perhaps about a \\"Justified\\" ex-boyfriend?<BR>TOUCH OF MY HAND-\\" I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream/ I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene\\" Hmmmmm..... I'll just leave it at that.<BR>BREATH ON ME-\\" You don't have to tuch me/just breeeaaattthhh\\" Ummm, okay, yeah, again,I'll leave it at that. Just to name a few. Brit's best so far. If you  are even remotly a Brit fan, you will like  this album( But, if you are over 13) The only reason why I say 'over 13' is because, there is some material on this album that my go over your head, but still, it's the subject matter on two songs, that's it. Brintey isn't a Madonna wannabe, she's a Madonna gonnabe(In the carrer sense) Always changing her style and image adn always leacing the crowds screaming for more. Christina, eat your heart out baby! Take a look at what real talent is and everything that you aspire to be!
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I love this movie!!!!! It has everything that you would expect in a superhero movie: lots of action, a little sexual tension, etc. I of course prefer Marvels superheroes (X-Men, Spider-Man, Daredevil, etc.) over DC's superheroes (Batman, Superman, etc.) because DC's superheroes try too hard to be perfect, whereas Marvels superheroes know that they are not perfect.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|At first I had reservations about buying this CD then i said what the hell, this CD has most of my favorite songs and i love listening to them. And the third disc is almost as great as the other 2. I love the live acoustic version of &quot;countin' on a Miracle&quot;. I would suggest this to every Bruce Fan.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'll just get right to the point...Hybrid Theory is amazing. Some people have a lot of stupid reasons for hating Linkin Park, but I myself am a HUGE fan of the band, and this CD is an amazing example of why they totally rock!<br />Papercut: 5/5<BR>An amazing guitar opens this song, followed by some meaningful rapping by Mike, but the bridge before the chorus is what get's me, &quot;It's like a face that I hold inside, face that awakes when I close my eyes!&quot; I love it.<br />One Step Closer: 4/5<BR>The only real reason I gave this track a 4 is because it was the single, so eventually you hear it alot! Don't get me wrong, I'm not burnt out on ANY Linkin Park song, I just like this one less than the others. <br />With You: 5/5<BR>When I first got this CD 3 years ago, this was my favorite track for the longest time. The thing I loved about it the most was Joe Hahn's scratching in the background during the chorus. <br />Points of Authority: 5/5<BR>&quot;Forfeit the game before somebody else takes you out of the frame, and puts your name to shame...cover up your face, you can't run a race the pace is too fast, you just won't last!&quot; Amazing. <br />Crawling: 4/5<BR>Much like One Step Closer, this song is not as good as the others just because it was played alot on the radio and MTV, but if you've never heard it (yeah right) you'll love it!<br />Runaway: 5/5<BR>Amazing song with meaningful lyrics and a pulse pounding chours that will get you banging your head.<br />By Myself: 5/5<BR>If you love super hard chorus's that get you jumping, screaming, and banging your head...you'll love By Myself. When ever Chester screams, it shakes your head and all you wanna do is rock out!<br />In the End: 4/5<BR>The only other overplayed single, but still good. Much like Crawling, if you've never heard it you'll love it. I still love it, just not as much as the others!<br />A Place for My Head: 5/5<BR>When you hear that twangy banjo like sound in the beggining, you might be confused, but soon, the song rocks out, and then Mike starts speed rapping madly. It's great.<br />Forgotten: 5/5<BR>I noticed that people tend to forget about this song, ironic that it's called Forgotten. There isn't even a live version of it on Live in Texas. It is a GREAT song with meaningful lyrics, much like Runaway. <br />A Cure for the Itch: 3/5<BR>It's obvious why I gave this track a 3...there isn't any words..or guitar. It's an entire minute or so of Joe Hahn scratching. He is a talented man, but I wanted it to rock out at one point so bad!<br />Pushing Me Away: 5/5<BR>AMAZING SONG. It is, in my opininon, the most powerful song on the album. With You was my favorite when I first got the CD, but when I listen to it now...this one is my favorite. The remix is even better.<br />Overall: 5/5<BR>Amazing album. There is no denying that Linkin Park has tons of talent, and I hope that they keep making great albums!
B00006CXXU|1.0|The so called &quot;music&quot; is so overproduced!! I'll admit that I liked a few of the songs. Now, i said a FEW. Like, &quot;DIRRTY&quot; &quot;FIGHTER&quot; &quot;BEAUTIFUL&quot; and thats about it. Seriously. It is that bad. And this CD had how many hit singles again? Oh, oh yes that right, none. Christina talks so much trash, I'm surprised that she can still &quot;sing&quot; with the dump of a voice she has.  if she hadn't talked so much trash, she might sound okay.  So, my advice to her is, quit while your ahead dearheart. Don't look back!! Count your blessings child. Oh, by the way, Christina, you don't even hold a candle to Kelly Clarkson. Or Pink for that matter. All those people you talked trash about, unlike you, have a little something called class.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really can't add anything new that hasn't already been said in the hundreds of previous comments....if you like watching a show with excellent writing and characters, buy this DVD set.<br />I have never bothered preparing an &quot;online review&quot; such as this before, but I was so impressed with this show, I felt it necessary to show my support.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta are one of the most thought-provoking bands i have ever heard, next to At The Drive-In, of course. The music sucks you in, enters your brain, mixes up your insides, and exits in stealth, leaving you speachless when it is all over. After you have listened to the record you feel overcome with not only joy of what you had just experienced, but amazement that five human beings could make such music.<br />The emotion put into the songs makes you want to break out in tears. The emotion coming from the death of a friend of TMV, Julio Venegas, who killed himself while the band was rehearsing while still in At The Drive-In. These true feeling of lead singer, Cedric Zavala, truely come out in all of their songs on De-loused.<br />The lyrics aren't the only thing that make TMV so amazing. Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Volta's guitarist, comes up with amazing hooks throughout the record, which flow so well with the songs and other instruments. A perfect example of this is in track one/two, Inertiatic Esp, where in the intro, after Cedric blerts his beautiful voice, when the guitar comes in abruptly and makes a perfect transition from intro to verse.<br />Every song on this record is great and the fact that they put so much emotion into each song makes them 10 times better. If you have not heard TMV, or own this cd, GET IT NOW!!
0312263120|3.0|This isn't literature at it's best and I'm not a computer geek so, it was just a quick and entertaining read and then it's on to the next one.  Like renting an average movie, it was worth the paperback price for the day of entertainment.  Happy New Year.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I don't agree with most of the reviews about the album being disappointing ....either they are not really into progressive heavy metal or they expect every DT album to be like Images&amp;Words or SFOM......I think every DT album is different...that's why there are the best progressive band...coz they are able to make something relatively new on every release....for those who like bands such as Symphony X, Evergrey and Aryeon....and also enjoy DT's 6DOIT and `Home' from SFAM...you must buy this album.....I have all DT's albums...this one definitely rocks....the instrumental stuff are better than 6DOIT...the best since I&amp;W.....guitar riffs and drumming are terrific.<br />The first track `As I Am' is such a good song...with a nice cool chorus.  The 1st part of the 2nd track...'Reflections of Reality (Revisited)'....is the highlight of the album ...excellent rhythm and vocals.<br />`Endless Sacrifice' is my favorite track...one of the best DT songs ever for me.....terrific chorus and instrumental stuff....from 6.35 onwards...exceptionally phenomenal.<br />`Vacant' is brilliant intro for the next track `Stream of Consciousness'...which is arguably the best DT instrumental song ever.  `In the name of God'...a brilliant track....the bass stuff is great....an epic song.<br />This is hard, heavy progressive metal at its best.....a good album that deserves at least 4.5 stars.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I just saw these guys last night and man they were AMAZING!!!!! Waking The Fallen is one of if not the best metal cd's out there. every single song on this album is good, you have to listen to every second of it! M. Shadows has the best voice and Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates are the best guitarists on the face of this earth. (well, one of the bests)their riffs are the sickest and their SOLOS...don't get me started with the solos. the drums also have an awesome double bass. you HAVE to BUY this FREAKIN cd or your not a metal fan. and get their first cd Sounding The Seventh Trumpet too! A7X!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My son gave my wife and me this set for Christmas.  We're 59 years old and not great fans of Sci-fi, or westerns either for that matter.  He instructed us to watch the background information (&quot;The way it was&quot;) on disc 4 first, then start with &quot;Serenity&quot;, as that was the way the creators had intended it to be, not the inside out, backwards way it was aired on Fox.<br />I was blown away!!!<br />This series has it all:  great stories, great screenplays, great sets, great photography, great music, great actors, great effects (not done just for the sake of effects), and, last but certainly not least, a sense of humor.<br />Fox didn't deserve this series.  The series deserves much better!  I hope soneone in Media will recognize that this is a gem and bring it back.<br />My wife and I have enjoyed every episode so far.  I am ordering another set to loan out as a &quot;conversion&quot; copy. This is just too good to keep to ourselves!<br />Bob Boyd, Vista,CA
B00008IAMD|4.0|Let me start by saying I am not a country music fan , but I've liked Johnny Cash since I was just a kid (I'm 48).The fist time I heard the title track was during the closing credits of the Tommy Lee Jones movie The Hunted that my wife and I rented. This was just days after Cash had passed away.The song blew me away.I had heard Hurt on the radio,and when I found out they were on the same album I had to get it.I wasn't disappointed.The title track,Hurt,and I Hung My Head alone are worth the price.The Hurt video is awesome and poignant.Ilike Johnny's version better than the Nine Inch Nails original. I Hung My Head is very powerfull.He does a great job of Personal Jesus (I'm a big Depeche Mode fan).<BR>Johnny Cash is larger than life,a once-in-a-lifetime talent that trancends musical genres.BUY THIS ALBUM.YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
0060935464|5.0|The Story being told in the eyes of Scout Finch. Always talking about her brother Jem being couragous and brave. They were two kids 7 and 12 and they loved each other and just follow each other around and did some pretty crazy things. All in all, a Great book that will be usefull for the rest of your life.
B00005JMGL|3.0|The problems with this version of 'Peter Pan' are numerous. First of all, the outrageously high usage of special effect and GGI take away the magic of J.M. Barrie's classic tale of the boy who won't grow up. Peter Pan is undoubtedly one of the greatest stories of all-time, but you would never know this from this horribly made version. I saw an interview with the director, in which he said this version is how J.M. Barrie would tell it if he had a big Hollywood budget and CGI to tell the story. Apparently, this director had no idea what he was talking about. The heart of the story should rely on the characters, their relationships and their development. Unfortunetly, the filmmakers thought the heart should be special effects, which completely ruins the great story.<br />Overall, the acting is fine. All of the acting is done superbly, with two major standouts, one of which is good, the other which is bad. First, Jason is a marvel as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. He plays the role originally and very well. A standout performance from a very fine veteran actor. However, the title character, Peter pan, is played very unevenly by Jeremy Sumpters. Sumpters did a very fine acting job in the very dark \\"Frailty\\", playing the son of Bill Paxton's character. I came expecting another great performance. Unfortunetly, the performance was scathing, im sorry to say. He looks the part, but needed much more emotion. His performance drags down the movie even more.<br />All-in-all, Peter Pan can be an ok movie if you watch it expecting what it is, a big-budget Hollywood movie that is big on special effects, but little on heart and story. Stick to the classic Animated Disney version. I guarantee your children will enjoy it more. <br />This movie could have been spectacular, but Hollywood always manages to mess up the most charming of tales. Who knew a telling of Peter Pan could be as bad as this? J.M. Barrie would be dissappointed.
B0000DCGT6|5.0|The unrated version on the gift set DVD had me laughing the hardest I can remember in a long time!  The 'Boom-Boom' T-Shirt and extra 'Making of...' all 3 movies DVD are like icing on the cake.<br />Seann William Scott is just perfect in this one!
B000068CNX|5.0|i got introduced to friends through the dvd box sets, and it's been a pleasure to watch them in order, with the full episode included, uncut. certain lines or parts of scenes are cut out on tv, so if you're a die-hard fan, having the episodes on dvd can be preferable. <br />i'm liking the third season better than second right now, but that's only a personal preference. there are some classic episodes included on this set - lots of ross and rachel, joey's first big role as drake ramoray on days of our lives, joey moving out of the apartment with chandler, and monica's relationship with an older man, richard. being that chandler and phoebe are my favorite characters, i missed their involvement a bit, but they got subplots. <br />highlights: ross and rachel 'you-knowing' in the planetarium part of the museum where ross works, phoebe's &quot;smelly cat&quot;, ross making a list about rachel, monica's character developing as she grows closer to richard, chandler finding an internet girl who turns out to be janice, all the tension between ross rachel and julie, etc.<br />lowlights: something about the episodes where eddie moved in seemed less well written and a little tedious. maybe it was just the fact that i was sick when I was watching them. *g* the fact that there are no chapters in episodes themselves, as others have mentioned, is a drawback. should have commentary from the six main character actors themselves; other shows do! deleted scenes would be nice; some of the special features seem useless, like showing a short clip of each guest actor when if you just watch the episodes, you have the whole thing. being able to check out monica and rachel's apartment in detail was kind of cool, though. and the quiz game was fun. if you get it wrong, it shows a clip of one of the characters shouting &quot;no!&quot;, which i thought was incredibly clever and funny.<br />that's all i can think of off the top of my head; i'm at work and can't check the dvds for specifics. :)
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Who would have thought that over a decade after they started, the Chili Peppers would still be at it, putting out the best music of their careers?  The energy they bring to their concerts is amazing, they sure get a workout.  The Peppers have developed a special chemistry and all four seem to have some kind of telepathic connection musically.  The track listing is only one side of the story, it's great fun to hear the band relax and jam between songs.  Anthony's vocals continue to improve, he really is one of the premier frontmen around, and alotta fun to watch.  Flea is his usual self, laying down some of the best bass lines in rock, and looking like there's no place he'd rather be than onstage.  Will Ferrell oop, I mean Chad Smith forms the other half of the Peppers backbeat, and he is hard and steady as always.  I saved the last spot for John Frusciante.  A few years ago it looked like John might never create music again, or even live, he was so addicted to heroin.  John has turned his life around so radically, watching him is very inspiring, and he seems like the nicest, sweetest guy you'd ever meet.  Now lets get back to the guitar playing, Frusciante is one of the most groundbreaking guitarists around today, along with a handful of others like Tom Morello.  His solo albums add proof to this, and he is the one and only true Peppers guitarist (I love Navarro, but his play is more suited to his own great band, Jane's Addiction).  Not only is Frusciante a great guitarist, he is also alotta fun to watch onstage.  I caught the Peppers in Portland, OR this year, and Frusciante played like he was posessed, jumping around, banging his head and truly losing himself in his performance, giving his all to the fans.  This is the best documented Chili Peppers concert, and it's one I will watch over and over.  A great gift from RHCP for those who missed them on this tour (their best ever) and a DVD that will surely bring back great memories for those lucky few who caught them.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a beautifully-made, thrilling, gorgeous movie.  It is intense, atmospheric, artistic, focused, and entirely effective.  The story of Sir William Wallace (even modified in places as this retelling admittedly is) is inspiring, and this movie portrays very well his courage and determination to stand up for his beliefs and his country, in the face of repression and wicked cruelty.  The cinematography, soundtrack, and acting are all exceptional.  From a literary standpoint, the characters are very well-drawn, complex and believable; in particular, Wallace's sometime ally Robert the Bruce is convincingly portrayed (and beautifully acted by Angus MacFayden.  <br />(The movie is admittedly very bloody, but even for squeamish people like I tend to be, it is a worthwhile film.  Keep the fast-forward on hand if you don't like viewing large quantities of blood.)
B00005JLCE|5.0|MADONNA WAS ROBBED OF AN OSCAR NOMINATION FOR THE SONGS \\"CAUSING A COMMOTION\\" AND \\"WHO'S THAT GIRL!\\"<BR>Oh, to be back in the summer of 1987, a month after seeing her live on stage for the TOUR!<BR>We were PUMPED for this movie and we loved it then and we love it still!<BR>I am Nikki Finn and I won't be ignored :-)
0767821769|4.0|Great movie!! 2 hours of comedy, drama, and a little romance too! Acting was very believable and kept me very hooked in the story! Although I must admit parts of when Susan Sarandon's sick character was witnessed truly grossed me out!! But that was really only for 2 short moments!! I hope everyone enjoys this movie because I really did!!
0812550757|5.0|It is these kinds of books that really discourage me from becoming a writer, because I could never write something like Speaker for the Dead and make it as good. Sure, it was a little hard for me to get into at first, with the language pronunciation page and talking about an alien race to which I had no connections to and therefore thought it boring (at first I thought Pipo was an alien), but after reading it all I have to say it was brilliant. The dialouge was what impressed me the most. With a character like Ender, I would imagine that writing his lines would be insanely difficult, because everything out of his mouth has to be genius. Sometimes I wondered, though, if what he is saying at a certain point in the book was the smartest thing to say, but I couldn't think of anything better. It was always interesting hearing what he had to say.<br />Another thing I wondered and am wondering is if people are as readable and as simple as in this book, where Pipo and Ender are able to look at Novinha and see how she feels (Pipo in the beginning, anyway). What she feels is not simple (there are many events and complications behind it), but it was simple ENOUGH that Ender could understand it all and make an accurate prediction about what she will do even though he had known her only a short period of time (though he DOES have a knack for that kind of thing). Maybe Card is an expert about how people behave and maybe he isn't, but I'M certainly not an expert. I can't tell if it's accurate or not; it makes sense but seems too easy. I hope this makes sense as it's hard to explain.<br />Still, this deserves nothing less than five stars. It was hard to have to wait a while to find out why the piggies killed who they did, but worth it. The plot is creative and complex. Card does a good job of portraying three kinds of alien species in the piggies, the buggers, and Jane. It was different than Ender's Game, but just as worth reading, in my opinion.
0060555661|5.0|I had always avoided reading Graham on the assumption that he would be an uninteresting read.  He is fabulous.  Clear, straightforward guidelines come out in clear english.  Zweig's updating is perfect - telling you when items are outdated enough to deserve skipping as well as including more up to date data.  Its clear, easy to understand, and straight from the guru's mouth.
B00008DDXB|2.0|The plot followed the book very well (with the exception that they cut out Peeves)but it goes downhill from there. the character portrayal from the books didn't seem quite right (esspecially Harry) <br />there was a sense (sometimes) of the magic from the books, but not in the overall product wasn't what it should be.<br />this movie was made on a large budget and a \\"grand scale\\" but it didn't show. Has Danial Radcliffe read the books? really has he? I was very dissappionted with the portrayal of Ron. He was too  whiny and scared all the time. Anyone would stop caring what happened to him.<br />The directing was also a problem. some people don't realize, but a director holds the movie together, not here. Chris Columbus is a good director (Home Alone) but not for this kind of movie. Speilberg (who can direct just about anything) or Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) would've been a better chioce.<br />And what is with the BRITISH ACTORS ONLY policy? it's biased that just cuz JK Rowling is a brit all the actors have too be? there are countless actors from other countries who would've been 10 times better. Most of them can do an exelent british accent too. <br />I'll see the 3rd movie, but my expectations aren't too high. personally I think Johnny Depp would've been a wonderful chioce to play Sirius, but, oh, I forgot, he can't. He's American.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club has become somewhat of a classic, and with good reason. This tapestry of eight womens' lives works beautifully as a novel. Tan is a gifted storyteller - her concise descriptions weaving a vivid world of Chinese tales meeting modern times. She uses just the right words to animate her characters. Recommended for mothers and daughters alike!
B000069HK2|4.0|I am not really one for 'screamo', as the genre-obsessed kids call it today, but this album is quite a piece of musical perfection. The lyrics are very thought out and eloquent, and the music fits it perfectly. <br />My only qualm is, again, the similarity between quite a few of the songs on the album. Else, this is a great addition to anyone's cd collection. <br />I would have given it a 5, but it misses something. In my mind, a 5 is a perfect album, an album that induces eye-closure, a dream-like state, even. This album is fantastic, and a great enjoyment to listen to, but it lacks a certain something to push it from the 4.6 I gave it, to a masterpiece of a 5. <br />But then again, the Used always have time to improve and release a sophomore cd. That, my friends, very well may reach a 5.
0451197968|4.0|The Running Man is a quick and exciting read - nonstop action will keep you turning the pages. In 2025, reality television dominates the airwaves, putting health and even lives at stake. King's vision in 1982 is uncomfortably close to the current state of entertainment media. It's more unsettling to read today than back in the early eighties.<br />For a Stephen King novel, The Running Man is unusually concise and not too gory. He describes only what's necessary to sketch out a bleak future. Unfortunately, this is also why his characters suffer a bit. The hero has but one motivation (to stay alive) and his feelings aren't really discussed. However, as a plot-driven story, it's understandable that character development takes a back seat.<br />The Running Man is designed to thrill and chill! Recommended for any fan of science fiction and action movies!
B000020617|4.0|Sadly, this was my first taste of the Foo Fighters. One morning, while waiting to go to school, I caught &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; on tv, and was in awe by the song. I almost completely missed the comedy-filled video; I was so entranced by Dave's amazing vocals and guitar. At this time, I had no knowledge of Nirvana, so I didn't even know how musically talented he really was (knowing vocals, drums and guitar). <br />I bought this album soon afterward, and it has become one of the mainstays in my musical collection ever since, even years later. The atmosphere of the album is what makes it so breathtaking, and ironically, I listen to it most on long late-night flights, where it mellows me out and puts me to sleep. It is relaxing and mature, and superb. This is what defined Dave Grohl to me, and what a perfect record to do it with.
0670032506|5.0|While this is an outstanding book, I highly recommend his first work, Getting Things Done.  Since this doesn't have a consistent narrative but is instead broken up into numerous tiny essays, it will be harder to get the maximum benefit from his approach to personal productivity from this alone.<br />Readers who \\"got\\" Getting Things Done don't need my advice on this one...they've already bought it I'm sure.<br />David Allen is probably the smartest personal productivity coach in print.  I would buy Getting Things Done for every employee in my organization, and I would have copies of this one lying around to remind people and elaborate on some of the finer points.<br />Oh and I would like to add one point.  I believe there is one thing missing from Mr. Allen's algorithm.  That is finishing.  I think his plan is outstanding for getting unstuck: figure out the next action, and do it without hesitation.  But I don't find any attention paid to how to decide how many actions are \\"enough\\" for a desired outcome of a project.  <br />You can always find some next action, and founder in what software engineers like myself call \\"permanent beta\\" or \\"feature creep.\\"  Yet external constraints are best not relied on exclusively for these decisions.  It's best to volunteer a ruthless focus on the essence of your project's deliverable, isn't it?<br />So I would like Mr. Allen to write his next book about finishing projects, if he is able to develop insights into that stage as strong as his insights into the process of the middle stages.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Simply for your audacity to claim this mainly released for revenue purposes. Did anyone balk at Pink Floyd's greatest hits, or The Eagles, or U2? Of course they didn't. Every great band has the right to release a &quot;condensed&quot; version of their musical careers and for a damn good reason.<br />If a kid picks up a greatest hits cd in a store, and loves it, guess what it will do? It will be the gateway drug, in a metaphorical sense, and open a whole new world to the little tot. He will, most likely, soon start buying up all the 'old' cds, to be able to fully appreciate the band. That is the main functions of 'greatest hit' cds, to introduce new kids to great music, not to somehow suck the remaining dignity of a band dry for a couple of bucks in the record companies pockets.<br />Besides, Dave Grohl, a superbly nice guy, would never authorize this if it were only to make a profit. He holds his role in the band and Kurt's legacy with too much respect to degrade it all in the blink of an eye. I assume most of the reviewers here are disenfranchised because of the sudden wide-spread ability to appreciate and listen to Nirvana. Before it was a small little club of hipster kids, now it is everyone. It's lost its cool factor, its insider-feel. <br />Well, I apologize for your loss of the self-esteem that came from being a musical snob, but this is a collection of the songs that defined Nirvana as one of the greatest rock bands of the 21st century, and I sure as hell am going to treat it as such. It's an excellent addition to anyone's collection, and flows into the ears so well, it may very well induce nirvana.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|From the opening scene this movie gripped me with it's extraordinary attention to cinematic detail.  Truly great movies seem know their great, they take their time in setting the dramatic stage allowing you to \\"be there\\" by not innundating you with dialogue all the time.  Your permitted to pay some attention instead to the setting, the music, the cinematography.  This movie tends to do that, which may put some people off because of it's slower pace.<br />The storyline, the characters, the music, all felt perfect.  This was a wonderful experience that I can't wait to have again when the DVD's released.<br />Enjoy...
B000022TSW|5.0|Oh, God. This movie was awesome. It was funny as sh**! It must of had hundreds of cuss words!
B000084T18|2.0|50 cent debut could have been better with his lyrical content. all the songs sound the same. the beats are the star on this album but for fifty himself in my eyes he falls short of being a great rapper like nas tupac or jay-z. and i believe this album was hyped up more by 50's personal life more than his rapping
B000001DTM|5.0|Still the best! Still fresh! It would still kick butt today and does!
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X is definitely one of my favorite Progressive Metal bands to date.  This release, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, is much heavier than their previous ones.  I feel most bands that start very technical, often lose some of that feel when they try to get heavier, but Symphony X still maintains the standards which have made them well known in the Progressive Music world.  This may be a great album well worth the $15 or so, but I feel the earlier works are a bit better in a couple areas like drumming and uniqueness in songs. The drums are bit flimsy on this record, and a few of the songs sound very much alike, but still great.  They have an excellent mix of members and styles as well.  The guitar and keyboard provide a great neo-symphonic/classical feel.  The singer has an excellent voice reminiscent of Ronnie James Dio, and the bassist shreds!   <br />The lyrics on this album are in the area typical of Prog Metal.  This doesn't stop them from writing above the standards, though.  &quot;Forces they're oppressing me, Lords of mediocrity, an iron will shall break the still, some will rise and some will fall&quot; Track 1, &quot;Inferno&quot;.  The usage of metaphors gives me goose bumps every time I hear them.  I think there's no singer that has yet met the greatness lyrically of Russell Allen, since Ozzy.<br />This album, for me, overshadowed the &quot;Train of Thought&quot; Dream Theater release.  Like I've stated earlier, some bands lose their feel when getting heavier, and I think Dream Theater has, and Symphony X hasn't.  My favorite song on &quot;Odyssey&quot; is &quot;The Accolade II&quot;, and to be honest, I don't really dislike anything about this album.  If this CD was stolen, I'd be mad and go out to get another one, but at the same time I'd be happy that more people are finally taking interest in this great band!
B00006LIRI|5.0|I just can't wait until The Best of 2000-2010!
B000002H33|5.0|Every so often, an album comes along that gets it all right.  Lyricism, musicianship, songwriting, and engineering come together to create a studio masterpiece.  There aren't many in American musical history, and even fewer in post-1980 rock, but Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is surely among them.<BR>Arguably Metallica's finest release, this is also the last album the feature the bass work of the late Cliff Burton, and is a fitting swan song for the bands best songwriter.  Some have said that this album is centered on the theme of the abuse of power, but I've always thought it was more about the objectification of human beings, be they mental patients, family members, expendable soldiers, or religious followers, and MoP covers them all.<BR>I could break this album down song by song, but other reviewers have already done a great job with that task, so I'll hit the important points:<BR>The musicianship is simply breathtaking.  Kirk blazes away with some truly stunning fretwork, and Lars never sounded better (nor has he since).  James Hettfield's voice was at it's best then, losing the adolescent shrillness from previous releases, but before alcohol and too much time on the road broke him down.  Last, but not least, the immortal Cliff Burton.  One can only wonder where his talent and genius might have taken the band, but this, his last release, gives us a hint.  Take a look at the writing credits in the liner notes.  Cliff's hand is on every one of their most complex songs, notably the masterpiece &quot;Orion&quot;.  I guess 8 minute instrumentals don't sell albums anymore.  Burton's ever evolving writing style brought the band this far, and the last of his influence can be hear on &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, but here it is in full bloom.  James and Kirk never matched the creative brilliance of this disc.  <BR>I can't close out this review without mentioning the engineering.  The mix on this disc did a great job of bringing out Burton's complex basslines without losing the crispness of Kirk's guitarwork or drowning Hettfields vocals.  The drums, as always, are way out front, giving Metallica their trademarked snare-driven beat.  The sound here is superbly balanced between RTL's fuzzy fury and AJFA's crisp sterilty.  <BR>Bottom Line:  A modern masterpiece, and instant classic.  This will join Jethro Tull's &quot;Aqualung&quot; and Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; as the zenith of their respective genres.
0061015725|3.0|I liked the story, but like many of Crichtons other novels, it ends quickly.  I felt like I was watching ER.  The story builds, with no character development, and then ends quickly...I do admit, I will read his next book and love his ideas....
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is simply the best dvd set ever made. This is exactly why they invented the dvd format. Almost 50 hours of incredibly amazing bonus material plus all the directors cuts!!! I think every Geek, Nerd and Sci-Fi freak should be in a video store looking for this box set right now!!! Every movie has a little of its own...Alien is just a pure melt down to the core classic.The bonus features are unbelievable and jaw dropping. Aliens is the pretty entertaining but not quite as good as the first. The bonus features for Aliens, explain why the production team had such a hard time working with a very egomaniac, insultative and stubborn director like Jim Cameron. Alien3 is the weakest of the box...but it has some very cool as hell elements that should keep you glue to the screen ...for example some very beautiful cinematography and production design. The bonus material explains why this film is so shallow and weak, even though it was brilliantly executed by great young director David Fincher.<br />Alien resurrection it's a delight for the senses, amazing cinematography by Darius Khondji and jaw dropping direction by french director Jean Pierre Jeunet...this fourth installment and its bonus features are simply magnificent!!!! The 9th Dvd is quite good just for the incredible Alien 79 documentary and some theatrical trailers...but everythingelse I could do without, it was quite dissapointing. Anyway...this is a great box to an amazing \\"Tetralogy\\" (I don't believe there's such a thing as a \\"Quadrilogy\\") and I hope that in a near future...every dvd could feature amazing stuff like this one!!!!
6300214753|5.0|I love Ferris Bueler. It is one of my alltime favorite movies. Everything about it makes me rate it a five out of five.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick is excilent as Ferris a high school senior with a HUMONGOUS case of senioritis who wants to ditch.<br /><br />Alan Ruck from Spin City plays his always sick pal perfectly, but I always wonder why they picked a 32 year old married father to play a 17 year old high school boy.<br /><br />Mia Sara is good as Ferris' girlfriend Sloan also.<br /><br />All in All I would have to say this is a great movie because it is every high school kids fantasy. Hang out with your best friend and girl/boyfriend and actually get away with skipping school.
B00005IC2H|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this album that hasn't already been said.  It's breathtaking, bold, groudbreaking, and above all beautiful.  I'm willing to bet that they have this on rotation up in heaven.  Every song feels like a star filled night sky on a cool autumn night.  The music is very hard to describe.  It's very ambient in a way, with beautiful string and horn arangments weaved into place perfectly throughout.  I think most every instrument makes an apperance on this album, and every instrument used is used perfectly.  The language spoken is often dubbed &quot;Hopelandic&quot;, and it is very beautiful.  It sounds like an angel is indeed singing.  <br />This is one of my favorite albums, and is one of the few albums that I treasure and am better because of.  Sigur Ros have created a tremendous piece of art.  I can not recommend this album enough, everyone should own this and listen to it regularly.  Things could be a lot better.  Buy this album for its originality and its beauty.
B00006M183|3.0|The most conspicuous aspect of Pearl Jam's Riot Act is the manner in which band exorcises its disdain for the Bush administration. The band has never hid its political beliefs; a shout out to those that have braved some of Eddie's rants at live performances. Namely, the track Bushleager eschews some of the subtlety and ushers the band somewhere in the realm of bad performance art. In a way, I think the band probably feels this track mirrors what they perceive to be a real &quot;jokey pokeyness&quot; on the part of the administration. Nevertheless, it makes for a bad track on a decent album. <br />The ballads are the centerpiece of the album. Theoretically, all their more politically charged tracks (See Green Disease) extend from a deep love one assumes can only be expressed in a slow love song. See Love Boat Captain. The band also touches on death and the importance of self-determination in Thumbing My Way and I Am Mine. <br />The opening track invites the listener into a studio session part religious invocation part political rally. Cant Keep is an ode of sorts to transcendance and sets the tone for the album. <br />Save You is a fine track that contains shades of Hail Hail and is quite comparable lyrically. I fear the album leans away from such tracks because of Vedder's slowly but surely diminishing voice. <br />The album's exit Arc typifies the whispery ballads PJ often uses as album getaway cars. It is a poignant tune that I think laments the collective unoriginality and reistance to the norm plaguing much of society and the album's listeners. Vedder haunts, &quot;...to myself, I surrender to the one I'll never please.&quot; To me, this is the most powerful and revealing part of the album. <br />Vedder and Co. pretty much preach to the choir in Riot Act. One can make the argument that they are fighting for relevance and attention on an increasingly bleak social-political landscape. But they'll have to do a heck of alot more than that to make it vaguely memorable. It's a good buy and adds alot to their catalogue. Enjoy.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|I love this movie, I have loved it for years. When I bought a new DVD of it I was totally turned off to it. If anyone has seen the original movie with the original American voices then you will not like this new version. The new voices are horrible compaired to the original ones. While I do love this movie and always will I guess I will just have to watch it on VHS until sombody gets it right and puts the old voices onto the DVD.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This movie is about a woman who checks out of a mental institution and gets a job as a secretary with a boss who also has mental issues. The woman settles down in her job but starts to make typo errors which leads to her boss verbally abusing her. She compulsively cuts herself in response. The boss notices this and then continues to reprimand her errors in an unorthodoxed manner which leads to a sadomasochistic relationship between the two. This movie is not for everyone but if you have an open mind and a taste for something different you'll find it entertaining in an enexpected way. I know I did expect to.....but I did anyway.
B000088E6P|1.0|I just hate the music in this cd, the lirics are just stupid, this cd is for stupid people, it just has no talent in it, you should better listen to dogs blare than listening this cd, sincerely i hope this short review gives you an idea of what a mess could be to buy this music. !Just dont buy it Its horrible.
B000002LND|5.0|What I mean by that is this, if you are a child of the 80s as I am you could soooo jam out to this CD.  Some friends and I went on an 8 hour trip and we listened to this repeatedly with the windows down and our voices up, even the quite ones were chirping in by the time we played it the third time!  Classic 80s tunes are all present here.  Everyone knows the words to Material Girl and Like a Virgin, and we all LOVE Papa don't Preach.  You can admit it too, you've stumbled through the words to La Isla Bonita, just like the rest of us.  Buy this album for the memories of the past, and to jam out with your buddys!<br />Ok now, everyone sing along and feel the beat:<br />&quot;Boys may come and boys may go, and that's alright, you see. Experience has made me rich and now their after me.&quot;<br />Buy it!  It's great!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Loved Norah Jones' voice and every soft whispered note which was  like the caress of a gentle  breeze at the beach.I would have preferred to hear her burst forth in dynamic resonance on  at least one uptempo song.  Her selections are one-dimensional, all of the same mood.  This lady can really sing and touch the Soul, but on this CD it's as if someone said-  &quot;Keep it soft,&quot;  and suppressed her natural exhuberant quality.
B000002N3J|5.0|Ok, I was just elated to find a CD with &quot;This Used to be my Playground&quot; on it!  But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that &quot;playground&quot; was certainly not the only fabulous song on the album.  &quot;I'll remember&quot;, &quot;Take a bow&quot;, &quot;You'll See&quot;,&quot;Live to Tell&quot; and &quot;One more chance&quot; are all as beautiful as ever and &quot;Rain&quot; is quickly becoming one of my favorite Madonna songs.  I always liked it , but now that I own it, I can really let it soak in and relate to it.  <br />Oh and if you don't get this album for any other reason, get it because her orchestral version of &quot;I Want You&quot; is absolutely incredible.  Who knew??<br />Madonna is at her best on this album, if you like Madonna you must own this album.  If you've never really given her a chance, this may be the best way to start!<br />Love her!
B00005JM02|5.0|Cute, fun, thrills and adventure, under the water, mostly.  Vivid colors and clever packaging of a little fish,  Nemo,  and his  survival, in the &quot;big sea  world&quot; and among  humans.  This adventure tale has more twists and turns as Nemo's Dad searches for him and must also  overcome all sorts of obstacles. Their reunion is suspendous- and the friends, allies and foes they encounter kept us alternately laughing and gasping.  Good musical scores and dazzling familar voices behind the animated characters make this DVD a treat for all.Uplifting and entertaining.  You folks out there just must see this and add it to your collection.  Invite your friends over and just have fun!!!!!
B00004YKUX|5.0|I read on Bob Dylan's website that when he was asked to write a comment about Johnny Cash's passing, only one thought sprung to his mind - &quot;Cash is King&quot;.  Cash is King, indeed.  &quot;Solitary Man&quot; is the work of a man who was literally at death's door yet as full of life and love as any man who's ever walked the earth.  In the liner notes, Cash wryly remarks that he didn't sound as good to himself as he did to producer Rick Rubin.  Is this just false modesty on Johnny's part? I think so, when you consider how masterful he sounds on songs that weren't penned by him but become wholly his own.  The old vaudeville of &quot;Nobody&quot; sounds as fresh today as it ever did, while &quot;One&quot; seems as though it's been a country standard going on a hundred years.  If &quot;Solitary Man&quot; had been Cash's last album, we could all rest easy that The Master had finished his career in unsurpassed greatness.  Thankfully, it wasn't....
6302891272|5.0|I am, just like 50 others that have strenuously written customer reviews for this classic Kurosawa Akira masterpiece, from Nagoya International School. My class has worked on Shakespeare's MacBeth, and has watched four different versions of the play on video. It was my favorite. Of the four, this was the only version in which the setting was completely removed from the original (Scotland) setting and was in Japan. &quot;Japan? MacBeth?&quot; you might think. Even though a lot of the valuable Shakespearian English quotes have inevitably been replaced by those that are Japanese, the main themes of loyalties and ambitions are nevertheless shown very well. They are not necessarily shown in a similar fashion, but they are shown. You will probably know what I mean if you watch the movie. It is suprising; Japan is on the opposite side of the world if you are in Scotland. But the unique feudal system of Japan, with its own distinct classes of nobility, allow the main storyline of MacBeth to flow smoothly in a pre-Tokugawa era Japanese setting. And don't forget: Mr. Kurosawa created this classic film. He does not remain in filmmaking history for nothing. From interesting camera angles (looking up at the characters from the dirt?) to rapidly changing, exciting horse-riding scenes, Kurosawa makes the black and white characters come alive in times of tension. Just remember: if you have no good movies around and you have nothing to do, and you suddenly stumble upon The Throne of Blood, pick it up and watch it. Yes, its 42 years old. But does it really make a difference if its interesting?
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This movie is all style with little substance.  The action scenes get confusing and the characters are paper thin, but the style is still there.  The movie is just the most beautiful thing to look at.  But, you know what, Kill Bill (at least the virst volume) was almost the same thing, only britter and more coherent.  This is assuredly not a movie for everbody.  Those of you who look at movies for the occassional mindless entertainment, or for great technique, then this is for you.  If you love moody, stylistic, goth films, this is probably for you.  If not, then stay far away.
B00003CWTI|3.0|This movie had the potential to be great.  However, it had three major flaws working against it.<br />The first, the most obvious, was the length.  Now, 3 hours 15 mins isn't necessarily long if it doesn't have to be (look at Peter Jackson's the LOTR trilogy).  However, like _Boogie Nights_, there are scenes in this movie that went on too long, and could have been edited to tighten the pacing.  <br />The second was the sloppiness in the editing.  In paring the film down to 3 hours, one of the storylines were lost... the whole thing about the &quot;prophet&quot; Dixon.  I mean, how *did* the body get in the closet, and how did the gun happen to get back to the cop? That's just poor storytelling.<br />The third was the soundtrack.  The soundtrack overwhelmed the action at the most annoying times, playing over the dialog such that we actually had to turn on the subtitles (which my husband hates in English-speaking movies) to figure out what was going on!  There was soundtrack going on even behind the background music in certain scenes!  I kinda liked the scene where all the characters sing along with the background song (my husband hated it).<br />OTOH, the acting was excellent, and the story, showing how an ensemble of characters each deal with the secrets of their past, their loneliness, and the things they truly want, is compelling.  My husband thought the thing with the frogs was a little too much &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, but I understand why it was there.  This film would have earned a couple more stars with some serious editing... if only P.T. Anderson would realize that a director's Vision must not overwhelm the good of the movie.
B000002MP2|5.0|This was the cd that brought Green Day into the mainstream and is arguably their best.  One of the major breakthrough albums of the 90's.  The music is catchy and the lyrics are great.  Every kid should own a copy of this cd before entering middle school.
B00005YXZH|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!  I am shocked an appauled by the negative comments that this CD has been getting from people who do not understand music.  It almost makes me sad.  This CD is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  Ironically, the more popular songs from the CD(heavy metal drummer) I don't find as interesting, though they may be more melodious.  The real brilliance of the CD comes mainly from the amazing lyrics.  &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot; is one of the best written songs I have ever heard.  The best songs on the CD, however, are &quot;Radio Cure&quot; and &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; with amazing lyrics, and slow but mesmorizing melodies.  BUY THIS CD!!!  You won't regret it!
B000002N2P|5.0|The follow up to their major breakthrough album, Dookie.  It's a little harder and a little more fast-paced, which is by no means a bad thing.  It's called Insomniac because most of the songs were written by Billie Joe when his crying new born son kept him up late at night.  The lyrics in Brain Stew are a perfect example of this.  Though not as good as Dookie, this is still an awesome cd.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|See this movie.  Words cannot describe the plot, just as they cannot describe how incredible this film is.  Amazing.  You must see it right now.  Funny, sad, moving, perplexing, its got it all.  What an amazing beginning by Richard Kelly, I can't wait for his next film.  BUY THIS MOVIE, you'll thank me later.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Buffy had the hellmouth; Smallville has a large number of kryptonite fragments giving the local villains all kinds of bizarre (although sometimes downright silly) powers which they then use to take on the young Clark Kent. The high point of the show is the  chemistry between Tom Welling and the gorgeous Kristin Kreuk as Clark and Lana; but the most interesting character is probably the young Lex Luthor. Very cleverly scripted; long-time fans of the Superman comic book should keep an eye out for the numerous one-liners which foreshadow Clark's future. Especially Lana's 'Come on Clark, I know you're not made of steel' =)
B00005JLYW|1.0|After the first 5 minutes of this film, I heard a little voice in my head say &quot;WHAT!? Thats it, I'm outta here&quot; followed by some pitter-pattering of feet, and a slammed door.  There is no way that I can express how bad this movie is, so I will quote critics.  &quot;Was this movie good?  No, if you took all the bad stuff out, it wouldn't be 5 minutes long.  Would I see it again?  I'd rather have my arm cut off with a potato peeler&quot;<br />&quot;about as subtle as a tap-dancing elephant&quot;<br />&quot;this film represents, in a very real way, the death of American cinema&quot;<br />Avoid this movie like the plague!
0790733226|2.0|Robert Zemekis' Sci-Fi flick is filled with potential.  Great use of President Clinton images.  Realistic usage of CNN anchors and reporters.  It's special effects are visually stunning.  The problem is the script.  The storyline lags behind the technical portion of the film and in the end, it left me with a bad taste and plenty of open holes that are just not believable.  It tries to be like \\"Close Encounters...\\" and ended up like bad religious version of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" without the nukes!  I was just not impressed with this effort!!  Sorry!!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|&quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keyes&quot; is a way of descriping her through her songs.  I thought her first multi-platinum album did that, but this does too!  I like Alicia Keyes cause she expresses herself, and doesn't sell records by acting like a pig/sleez! <BR>This is a great ablum and though she experimented, it did what she wanted it to do, tell her story through her music! <BR>    The bonus DVD is also a great look into her.  I love the album &amp; the DVD.  I think her next single should be &quot;So Simple&quot; or &quot;Karma&quot;.
B00008H2LB|1.0|As part of the rap-rock scene, Linkin Park is one of the leading bands on the charts. The reason, however, is beyond me. Their songs all have the same basic melody of techno mixed with rap and each song has the same idea. In the hit single \\"In the end\\" the band sings \\"I had to fall/To lose it all/But in the end/It doesn't even matter.\\" In the song \\"One Step Closer\\" they sing \\"Everything you say to me/Takes me one step closer to the edge/And I'm about to break.\\" In \\"Crawling\\" the band sings \\"crawling in my skin/these wounds they will not heal/fear is how I fall/confusing what is real.\\" It seems that every song is about a guy who is falling. You would think that after 4 years of success and millions of dollars, this guy would be flying.

B000000OSE|4.0|This gets 4 stars because of the dross, but that is rescued by one incredible 10 minute piece of rock music called &quot;Coma&quot;. One of the greatest rock songs ever. If this album was culled along with the blue covered companion, it would be one hell of a record. Maybe that is why CD burners have been invented.
B00005JMGL|5.0|I must admit that until I read the book and watched this movie I really never did understand Peter Pan.  The stage version with Cathy Rigby was truly confusing and ridicules.  But, two weeks ago I did read the book and then yesterday went to see the movie.  The movie was fantastic.  It did follow the book extremely well with three exceptions.  One, it omitted some minor bits of the book (like the neverbird) that would have probably slowed down the movie and not added much.<br />Two, the epilog was not shown but I think the same point was made at the end where Peter is looking in at the reunited Darlings and the narrator says that it (growing up in a family) is one joy that Peter will never have.<br />Three, way too much was made about Peter being too young to understand love.  This did not come from the book but, rather, the script writers.  Some other reviewers below have tried to psychoanalyze why some men seem afraid of commitment in relationships by saying that they are like Peter Pan and just won't grow up.  That is purely simplistic.  In most instances men that won't commit are actually very much in tune with what love is; more than the women trying to make them commit.  Unfortunately, they have been hurt in the past by women that really don't know that love is more than a word for a relationship.  After learning that they can be hurt for falling in love they then proceed with much more caution.  A fear of commitment?  No.  A fear of being emotionally hurt.<br />The special effects in the movie were great and almost surreal.  Tink was a little over done but all of the rest of the cast played their parts perfectly.  Like the book, the movie was pretty much a story of Wendy growing up.  Peter Pan and Neverland was really just a vehicle used by the author to show the loss of innocence in the transition from childhood to adulthood.  Peter Pan made the perfect contrast to Wendy.  The child that would never grow up with the child that realized she had to grow up.  Definitely a five star movie.  This is one that will definitely go into my DVD collection.
B00005JMTN|4.0|Tim Burton's visually stunning but a bit too drawn out fable Big Fish was actually more deserving of 3 1/2 stars.<br />Pretty boy Billy Crudup playing Will Bloom, a young married reporter estranged from his father Ed Bloom is drawn to his dying dad's bedside to understand the essence of his life.  The aged Ed Bloom played marvelously by craggy, jowly, veteran actor Albert Finney was a Alabama based travelling salesman whose life story consisted of a Forrest Gumpian collection of hard to swallow tall tales.  Crudup and his wife played by French actress Marion Cotillard are treated to a plethora of these fables narrated by Finney.<br />The young Ed Bloom played by the versatile and likeable Ewan Mc Gregor marches through many improbable life experiences supported by nice performances by among others, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, and the weirdo Steve Buscemi.  Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman give creditable performances as Ed Bloom's wife Sandra respectively older and younger.<br />The movie loses some of it's luster as it plods on about 1 or 2 stories too long.  The ending is somewhat predictable which left my with a slightly vapid, unsatisfying feeling.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|It didn't take long for this one to grow on me once I heard the guitars kick in on the third song.  Now I love ALL of it.  THE STROKES should not be treated as lightweights.  What they are doing is every bit as challenging and fun as what THE WHITE STRIPES are up to (another favorite band).  THE WHITE STRIPES have the advantage of being a two-piece boy and girl rock band, whereas THE STROKES have the more typical rock band line up.  But hey, they are BOTH making great music.<br />THE STROKES have come along further than one would expect, given that their first album sounded like a set of LOU REED dirges.  Now they are their OWN band with their OWN sound.  And they did it just by expanding their sound via tempos, chords and fab songwriting from vocalist Julian Casablancas.  This is MUCH tighter than the first album, and after OUTKAST, gets my vote for album of 2002.  Above all, it is a LOT OF FUN!!!
B0000TB014|5.0|MJ is the king of pop and this dvd shows you why.  It has videos to his number one songs!!  It even has Dirty Diana!

0553347845|3.0|What do you care about what other people think?  Well, after reading this book (and Surely You're Joking ...), I came to the suspicion that Feynman cared a hell lot about what other people thought of him.  I found this book entertaining, but I believe one of the main goals really was to convince the readers how much smarter he was than the rest of us.  I understand that it's in fashion for physicists and grad students of physics to rave about anything Feynman.  But then, physicists aren't unlike teenage girls who worship rock stars.  There are groupies.  There are physicists.  And then there are groupie physicists.<br />It'd have been nice if there were a book called &quot;Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Schwinger&quot;, and the like.
B00008AWOD|4.0|This album is hard for me to review.  Most of the songs are good but I don't think they are up to the usual Placebo standards.  FYI, my fav album of theirs is Black Market Music so you know where I'm coming from.  I saw them in concert a few weeks ago and it was great.  When they played songs from this CD, they didn't seem out of place or anything, but they just weren't as good as other material.  If I was you, I would &quot;acquire&quot; at least 3 random tracks from the CD and see what you think.  Try to avoid the singles.  Who knows?  You may like the new direction Placebo is going in...
6305807930|3.0|I am a huge fan of Suspiria and Dario Argento so naturally after seeing Suspiria I rushed out and bought this. I knew this installment couldn't really match up to Suspiria but to tell you the truth I couldn't help but be a little dissapointed. Here are some of my likes/dislikes with the film.<br />LIKES:<BR>Dario's direction and sense of style have not changed and the set pieces and shots in the film are top notch.<br />The kill count nearly doubles in this installment which leads to some very good moments, and some not as good. But nothing horrible (I mean you gotta love that hot dog vendor scene). And although the music may not be as creepy the suspense is still very much there.<br />The elaboration on the plot (although still a little confusing) is always nice.<br />DISLIKES:<BR>The music bugged me a lot and is by far my number 1 compaint with this film and basically why I gave a 3 instead of a 4. This may seem trivial but the heart pumping masterwork in Suspiria gripped you and kept you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. The score in Inferno just fails to do this and is mostly just a soft piano score which loosens the tension and atmosphere for a lot of the film.<br />The only other thing that bugged me enough to mention was a few of the killings. I mean as I stated earlier I like most of them but they failed to match up to the grandiose masterpieces in Suspiria. More deaths are always good but it seems in some cases they exchanged quality for quantity. Moreover the back on the DVD says it's uncut but particularily in one of the scenes it fades out rather abruptly which bugged me because it was probably the best death in the film (I speaking of the window scene where Rose is killed).<br /> <BR>OVERALL:<BR>Despite a few areas most of the aspects of this movie are quite enjoyable and I highly reccomend this, especially to fans of Suspiria and Dario Argento.
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is valuable more for its ability to interest people in art history and medieval politics than for the story itself.  The story is unique and well planned, but the writing itself is not spectacular.  Author Dan Brown employs the tried-and-true method of cliffhanger endings for every chapter, misleading characterization that draws suspicion to almost every major character, and a series of fascinating clues that simply yield more twists and turns.  This is not necessarily a bad thing--although Brown employs rather routine mystery novel ploys, he does it very well.  His mastery of the basic elements of mystery writing makes what would otherwise be a mediocre novel a very intriguing page-turner.<br />I have to admit that I was drawn to this book because of the tempest of controversy surrounding it.  Personally, I didn't find the controversy to be warranted.  Many of the \\"scandalous\\" premises of the novel should already be familiar to anyone who has studied art history, medieval history, or simply the doctrines of the various Christian faiths.  The book is recommended by everyone from singer Tori Amos to Laura and George W. Bush.  Regardless of one's personal beliefs, this should be interesting book for any reader.
0385504209|4.0|I flew through this book with such relish that I was done within 24 hours of cracking the cover. At its core, The Da Vinci Code is a mystery, but it's such a smart one that I didn't get my usual &quot;I hate mysteries&quot; heebie jeebies. The story is packed full of unique keys, secret codes, hidden hiding places and secret societies. And who doesn't love a good secret society?<br />Dan Brown clearly did some hefty research for this novel, but I think it shows (off) a little too often. There's a bit too much, &quot;Hey, look what I learned!&quot; mixed in with the fiction. Sometimes it's even hard to tell the two apart - but that's not a horrible thing, this is not meant to be a textbook, after all. It was deliciously decadent to slip into the role of questioning the motives of one of the most firmly-rooted establishments in the world; the Church.<br />The plot is intricate and fast-paced, which draws your attention away from the one-dimensional characters. And the cliffhangers, admittedly transparent gimmicks, do what they're supposed to do - they make you want to read the book faster.<br />The Da Vinci Code is fantastic for what it's meant to be... an entertaining read. Anyone who criticizes it for being plot-driven or inaccurate is just being pompous and biased against popular fiction.
0316666343|5.0|This book was Amazing, heartfelt, honest, complex, and bittersweet all mixed into one inthrowling reading experence. One I began reading I couldn't tare myself away, finding myself reading and clutching the book at odd times just to get through another page. Alice Sebold's writing is beautiful; 300 pages of poetry and lyrics that told the story of a young girls life cut short and her own stages of grief as well as her families. I recomend this book to anyone, I don't think that theirs a person of this earth who couldn't read this book and walk away with something. Amazing, I can't wait for Alice Sebolds next book.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Having started out hating this series, its ironic how much I love anything Lord of the Rings related, and this soundtrack is another exapmle of this.  The music conveys teh tone of the movie, and even though I haven't seen the movies all that often, I can still picture the scenes that the music came from.  Soundtracks are a great way to relive a movie without having to sit through another 3 hour long movie.  would definately recommend this to anyone interested in the books, movies, or just likes classical sounding music.<br />It amazes me that Billy Boyd really does have an amazing voice.  I'm not sure if it was digtally enhanced or whatnot, but if that is his real voice he should be in musicals, if he isn't already, because it really is amazing.  I think that &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; is my favorite track because of it.  the song is haunting and his voice is perfect for it.
B00004TCPJ|5.0|For those missing a Rachmaninoff 3rd Piano Concerto in their collection, start with Reiner/Horowitz or this one, Ormandy/Horowitz. Horowitz was perhaps _the_ interpreter of this particular concerto, and at least the two above mentioned recordings are must-haves.<br />The Rach 3rd belongs in the canon of best Piano Concertos, and Horowitz gives it the warmth and weight it deserves. Really, if you are a piano enthusiast, you just can't go wrong here. The sound quality of this CD may be less than optimal for people demanding absolute crispness, but I'm not fussy when it comes down to such technicalities.<br />The eight or so other reviews here are splendid, so I'm not going to repeat things to the point where they become numbing. I recommend this CD without reservations.

B00007ELEL|4.0|Up front I tell you that this is a film that may or may not fascinate you. It's a comedy and one that's different than most others of the genre. But if you have seen Fargo and liked it, well, then you almost certainly will enjoy The Big Lebowski. A few laughs and grins belong to the possibilities, I think.<br />The cast is the Coen Brothers' usual odd mix: Jeff Bridges (in the role of The Dude), John Goodman (as The Dude's bowling buddy), Steve Buscemi (also in fargo), Peter Stormare (also in Fargo), and others such as Julianne Moore, who features as an erotic artist.<br />The plot is not at all that important; it's the weird scenes such as the one in which The Dude is harassed by the nihilists and their 'ferret', bizarre characters, and unpredictability that hold The Big Lebowski together. <br />The unemployed Jeff Lebowski does little else besides smoking pot, bathing, and bowling. Unfortunately he shares his name with some other man ... troubles begin.<br />I liked it, and do recommend it with certain reservations.
0446530891|1.0|I am a great fan of Baldacci, but this book was just cranked out probably because the publishers wanted another book from him.  He just didn't have it in him this time.  What a bitter disappointment this book was.  I do hope he doesn't write another book until he is ready.
B000002IAS|5.0|This is what Rock and Roll was, is and always should be.  Perfect synthesis of energy and art. Raw and yet controlled. D &amp; B's vocals are the perfect match for Clapton and friends. Just about every track penetrates.  My favorite is Coming Home - you can feel the soulful earnestness of the vocal supported by superb guitar work.  While that's my favorite, the other tracks for the most part are tight runners up.<BR>My opinion one of the 5 greatest Rock and Roll records ever!
B00006ADFL|5.0|What a shock it was when I learned Peter Jackson of LOTR directed this movie!<BR>This is a very rare film indeed...it has never left my mind even after so many years. That is quite a feat when you consider the amount of &quot;stories&quot; we see. <BR>Others have explained the story. I can only agree it is a movie that will &quot;stick to your ribs&quot; as mother used to say! I more than highly recommend it. Trust me on this one and I am not easily impressed by &quot;hollywood&quot; nit-wits.<BR>I thought Jackson was wonderful with LOTR but I have an even higher respect  now that I know he helmed Heavenly Creatures (one of my very favorites!). Not to forget the huge talents of his partner in crime FRAN WALSH.
0783241542|5.0|I just saw this movie recently, and I love it.  For all the teenagers, its perfect.  Guys are always trying to have relations with girls, and this is the perfect high school atmosphere.  This movie is so funny!!  It's sexy, and the girls and guys make cute couples.  The parents of the main character, Jim, are too hilarious!  You gotta see this movie!!!!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I've never seen this Music/Anime/Classic. But based on the other reviews it sounds and/or LOOKS FANTASTIC to any Daft Punk fans out there hoo have to get this. I live in America so this a rare film considering it came out in Japan and differnt countries I dont live in. By this DVD its probly the only Daft Punk avilable. Discovery is a graet album my favorite song is (I actully enjoy every one) but my favered one is probly out of all is Aerodynamic it has lots of cool tones and stuff. By this DVD it is The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Peace Out!!
B0000DCGT5|5.0|I saw this movie with a bunch of my friends, and it was so hilarious that we all almost fell off our seats!  I had to get this movie once it came out, and the characters are just as funny as ever.  Everything is just the same, but now, the band geek and the guy who couldn't get a girl, are getting married, and what their friends do, it's a wedding to remember!!
B00008US8R|5.0|Omigosh!  Buy this CD!  It's incredible!  I absolutely love every single song on this album (and that rarely ever happens).  This is rock-pop music at it's best and definitely worth every penny.
B00008K7AM|5.0|I got this movie for my birthday last May and when I saw this movie in the theaters, I laughed so hard that I almost fell off my chair.  This film is perfect for girls trying to explain what its like to be a girl, and vise versa.  How life is as a teenager, and how love can come true.  Just think what it would be like to switch lives with someone that you don't even know and that is of the opposite sex!  That's why everyone I know loves this movie!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a really wonderful album if you want to just get up and move.  It just has some awesome tunes.  By far the best album she has released so far.  I think Britney has really found her groove and I hope she sticks with this one.  My favorite songs include Outrageous and Toxic.  Both are very nice tunes that you can't help but dance and sing to.  I have not always been a Britney fan, but this album has me sold! Please don't buy this album expecting something deep and meaningful, just buy it for something fun to listen to.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is really good and u can like feel the action and the momentum of the action in this music!! This is really good music!!
B00008438V|5.0|It's 1985 and I'm back in high school again. This movie is certainly a teenage boys movie. I liked Chet, looks like a guy i work with (when he's turned into a turd).This fast times at Ridgemont high and better off dead are my fav. H.S movies from the 80's.
0385504209|2.0|Mr. Brown uses the very same tactics that he suggests  the Catholic church has used over the centuries to mislead the world.  By mixing fiction with a little fact he has managed to challenge what many have accepted as the truth, but it would be giving Brown too much credit to suggest that this is what he meant to do with this book--to illustrate that irony.<br />As far as the writing goes it is a fast, often annoying read.  Mr. Brown loves adjectives to the point of redundancy.  Here are some I would use to describe The Da Vinci Code: shallow, wooden, uninspired, trite, and clunky.
B0000DD7NL|2.0|This cd was not worth the money at all.  I bought it because her first cd was cool.  I loved &quot;you don't know my name&quot;, but the rest of the cd is not for me.
0671319809|4.0|Honor Harrington books are a guarantee of fast paced action, page turning prose, and an appealing heroine. The books do not always take the easy way out. The endings are not always as happy as they could be, and the answers are not as easy as you might think. That adds spice to the straight-line plots, which, along with the fine characterization of the heroine (if few others) make these books a &quot;can't miss, can't put down.&quot; They are potboilers in the finest sense of the word, the way Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars were. They treat their subject with respect. You'll never be bored with this series--and this is one of the best books in it. Do yourself a favor and read one or two of the early ones first so you can get a flavor for what's happening.
B00005JMTQ|4.0|Nicholson was consumate as usual.  He is a real man's man who can still make you belly laugh when you don't expect to.  Keaton was extremely good, eventhough she can't really act a lick!  She seemed to get into her stride later in the movie.  Reeves was as lackluster as ever.  He was as lame in this as in most of his movies.<br />The plot was oriented toward the 40+ crowd and didn't dissappoint.  Thought some indicated this a chick flick it was far from that if you went to see the Nicholson stick along with the young girls beaten off by the Keaton character.<br />A must see.
B000059XUO|5.0|A romance that builds to a height that without the depth of the characters, would've ceased to be a movie adapted from James O' Barr's vision and changed into a movie adapted from Marvel comics. The film is directed with style and mood, which makes up for the usually heavy-handed villians. Brandon Lee of course totally embodies the character of Draven and is the glue that makes the film work. <br />There's quite a bit of extras on the second disc. The most interesting for me, was the interview with O'Barr which gives insight into his motives and reasons for doing what he does and has done. <br />All said though, the movie can never replace the book by O'Barr, which is arguably is essential if you saw this film and liked it.
B000003S09|5.0|This album is a progressive rock classic!!! A masterpiece!!! Five stars!!! A+
B00006SFLV|4.0|This is such a good show! I happened to catch in on MTV and I feel inlove with the boy that lead girl was inlove with, this show had potential to be on much longer! Adleast we got the DVD to cherish.
B000002KAT|5.0|This album is a masterpiece!!! Every song is great!!! Five Stars!!! A+
2862608408|5.0|I was introduced to this book while teaching in Scotland.  The students loved it and so did I.  I bought 2 of them before I returned home.  One I kept for myself the other I gave to my goddaughter.  She loved it.  I started teaching grades 6, 7 and 8 and I would read it to them if we had extra time, and even THEY would ask me to read it again or request it later on in the year.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, its fantastic!
B000000W5L|5.0|This album is a 70's classic!!! One of Rolling Stones' best recordings!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is not bad music. It is very good music in fact. Even though I might not like piano music very much I won't deny that it is good music. Because it is, its just not my type. And many people with brains like rap music. So just go minding your own buisness and listen to your piano music and drink your diet beer. Now this album is an incredible achievment in rap. Some of deathrows best beats and Snoop's best lyrics. I liked him better before he started only singing about being a pimp. Buy this Snoop album and The Last Meal those are is only really good albums.
B000002KHF|5.0|This Van Morrison album is an absolute classic!!! A treat from start to finish!!! 2 thumbs up!!! A+
B00008438V|5.0|This movie is the best &quot;retro&quot; comedy movie in cinema history!!! It keeps you laughing through the whole movie! Not just giggling, but the kind of pee-your-pants laughing.I think the best scene is when the blonde kid gets drunk at the club...the way he slurrs is HILARIOUS!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album is a classic masterpiece!!! One of the best albums of all time!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five Stars!!! A+
B000092ZYX|1.0|These guys are so expirimental. Thet are geniuses. I am special too because I like them. In fact, I am better than you because I &quot;get it&quot;.
