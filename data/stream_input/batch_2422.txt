B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved how Riordan started the Heroes of Olympus series, and after finishing The Lost Heroes I was left wanting more.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Really love this app. It's good to know exactly how much battery is left. Highly suggest getting this for your kindle fire.
0307716554|4.0|I was given a copy of this book for free as part of the From Left to Write book club. I loved how it was written in second person, you just don't find that very often! I did not figure out who the arsonist was until the person was revealed, which is something I like in a mystery. By the end I felt like I had an emotional connection to the characters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Outstanding Super Good.  App does everything a great weather app should and a lot more.  News, maps, radar custom cities, hourly, daily ten days, etc.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD and it's just as easy to use as on the computer. Love it!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I chose five stars cuz the book the wonderful wizard of oz is really wonderful. the part I like about this product is the details and other things were going fine. And other books I read aren't as wonderful as the wizard of oz. Thank you to the people who help write this wonderful book!:)
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I've loved this movie forever. Jimmy Stewart is terrific. Watch every year. Love having the colored version as well as the black and white.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I rented the 48 hour HD VOD rental streamed through my xbox 360.  First off, this movie is not in 5.1 surround sound, it is in stereo.  I didn't look for this, I assumed it would be in 5.1.  I changed my xbox to stereo output and let my receiver decode it through Dolby ProLogic II.  At least the vocals came through my center channel and not my main speakers.  Also, it paused about 10 times through the whole video.  Twice it paused for a couple minutes and then went to the screen &#34;Sorry, there has been a problem.  Please try again later&#34;.  My internet connection is fine.  Movies through xbox rentals always played fine.  I would rather give my money to Amazon but I guess I'll just pay a little more and get the xbox videos from now on.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is such a great game! It really makes you use your brain to figure out how to  open certain doors, drawers etc. to find keys  or other items needed to open other doors/drawers and eventually complete the chapter. I haven't finished the game yet so I'm not sure how long the game is. I have just completed chapter 3 there's at least 4 chapters. There is a hint button which pops up after a certain amount of time of not making progress and usually there are 3 hints in a particular side you are working on. I like the fact that it doesn't give the answer right away (hence the word hint!) Usually the 3rd hint really helps if you're really stuck. I think it's a great game all around. Very laid back and can be relaxing (if you don't get frustrated) without timers to race against. Definitely worth the $1.99!
1439152756|5.0|I loved Alice and felt so sorry for this intelligent and highly educated woman as she faced the challenges of Alzheimer's disease.
B00008438V|5.0|Good movie, for youngsters as well teenagers and adults. Is a classic of all times. I highly recommend it for the entire family.
B009P13RQY|2.0|This is a boring album in my opinion I mean it reminds me of Ozzy and Black Sabboth for some reason which I cant stand either one of them so this album or band is not for me.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Love Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman. Thought it was very entertaining and exciting. I love all the Ironman movies.Love Thor too.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I'm almost done with this book, but had to write a review.  I love it and have trouble putting it down.  However, you have to have a real stomach to get through all the orphanage stuff and then his living with that horrible couple.  Hard to believe that he has survived so well.  Yes, he has his problems, but wow!  I find this book very thought provoking.  I find myself thinking about it long after I put it down.  It will be hard to finish and say good bye to all the characters.  I love Lydia!  God works in mysterious ways even in fiction. I finished it now and already miss the characters.  Fantastic read!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the ease of use on here, and the larger format. The convenience of having this app on my Kindle also makes this calculator a valuable and mobile asset for work.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I would recommend everyone to watch this.  It's a great, cute film for people of all ages and it brings a feeling of nostalgia.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson masterfully wraps up Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Perhaps the best single book in the series. This one leaves you completely satisfied as all of the random treads of the extensive series come to conclusion cleanly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series. 5 stars. Awesome storyline with intense action and suspense. It's a must watch tv program. Can't wait for season 4!!!
B00679T1EO|5.0|I've watched all 3 seasons and this season was well on its way to being my favorite until they kill off two main characters. I was devastated when Cybil died, then the last episode when Matthew dies was too much!! What???? He's what the writers have based the show on. I'll still watch when Season 4 starts but I don't know where they will go with it now. Sigh...
0345803485|5.0|This was by far the best series/trilogy I have ever read. I didn't know what to expect when I started reading it but after the first few pages I was hooked. Yes, it is very sexual, that's pretty much the whole point of the series, but it is also a good love story. I love the characters and fell in love with Christian Grey, who didn't?? It is not \\"mommy porn.\\" That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard when describing these books. It is a must read, the second and third book are just as good.
1616551151|4.0|I've been looking forward to getting this for awhile. Unfortunately, I bought the kindle version rather than the actual book, against my better judgement.<br /><br />Gorgeous as the pictures are, interesting as the info is, it's damn near impossible to read it! The text is tiny, and the kindle version doesn't allow you to zoom in. You can read it, but it starts to hurt your eyes eventually. The text is JUST large enough to read, and rather blurry besides. And there's some text that you literally cannot read because of the size of the text and the color of the background and the color of the font.<br /><br />It's a great resource, but buy the actual, physical book version if you can. I wish I had.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|The Clifton Chronicles have left me spell bound. An easy quick read, the twists in the tale keep you glued to the book.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|This was a god movie. Lots of action which kept my nephew's attention.  Looking forward to seeing more from this writer.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|I read, or more accurately, attempted to read this trilogy at the insistence of a friend who loved the books. I admit they are not something I'd normally read, and I didn't particularly enjoy any of them. I kept reading, waiting for the &#34;it gets better&#34; moment that my friend assured me would happen, but after reading about a third of the way through the Fifty Shades Freed book, I gave up and stopped reading. Putting my own tastes in books aside, I found all of these books to be poorly written and of  fairly low standard. I also found the characters to be frustrating and unrealistic. I know this book is fantasy, but even in fantasy, the characters need to behave in a realistic way for the story to be plausible. I just didn't find that in these books. For those who loved the series as much as my friend, this book no doubt brings the story together to a satisfying conclusion, but I personally was not able to remain interested in it or the characters long enough to even force my way through what I felt was the weakest of three very average books.
0345803493|5.0|People are crazy when they say these books are awful. I loved them! I didn't want them to end I just wanted to keep reading. I hope she writes a 4th book in the future!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I tried this game for fun .... and now I can't stop  this game is good for spear time I play it all the time so I recommend this game so flow on over and get it
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I was truly into this game,very entertaining and made me think but had a hard time getting the game to respond and finally ending up freezing up my Kindle Fire HD
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|The best mix of strategy and challenge, this game rocks.  It's great having options to charge appearance and hints to keep going.  I also like completing the achievements.....something to work for.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Never have I been so addicted to a card game.  This is by far the best Spider solitaire app that I have tried.
0345803507|5.0|The three books are awesome. I loved it from the beginning to end. Definitely would recommend. People who say these books are awful shouldn't have bothered reading it if they didn't love them. I can't wait to see the movies!!
B00BDSRISA|5.0|IS ONE OF THE FINEST ALBUMS THAT I OWN,FOUND THE GROUP ON<br />TV SHOW,HAD TO BUY THE ALBUM,WAS EXTREMELY SUPPRISED HOW<br />GOOD THIS BAND IS

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This Mahjong game is very challenging.  I like being challenged.  I have not beaten every level, but that is the fun of playing.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|Well, if you like &#34;The End of Life on Earth&#34; type movies or &#34;let's see how much suffering a person can take&#34; stories, then you're going to love this one.  Pretty much the same old worn out, predictable stuff.  The only high point is when you get a brief glimpse of Naomi Watts' boob.  I'm going to give ya'll the formula and you can just write your own stories, as many ways that you like:( ____ are in love.  ____ is threatened by ____, Will love ever triumph? It does.  Happy Ending.).  The only thing I found &#34;Impossible&#34; was trying to sit quietly through the whole thing while my wife sat wringing her hands in anxiety.<br />Rating?........ Nine thumbs down.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Absolutely Fabulous!!! Love, Love, Love it...will enjoy it over & over again! What more can I say, it's great! Over!!!

B00BQHA06A|5.0|HIM's 8th studio album shows a return to their roots. This album is full of up-beat, catchy songs and a ballad (the title track, Tears on Tape).<br /> I've been a HIM fan since before they were big in the U.S., and I can honestly say that this could very well be their Masterpiece. It's like they took Dark Light and Razorblade Romance and added just a hint of Screamworks, which brought forth Tears on Tape. It's not a very long album. There are 4 instrumental tracks, which I didn't like the idea of at first, but after listening to the album I didn't care because it was so freakin' good!<br /> I'm a diehard HIM fan, so I bought the Limited Deluxe Edition, as I do all of their albums. The only difference is that this version contains a DVD with live in-studio performances of some of their older songs (I'm actually watching it as I write this review). If you can live without a video of some live songs, then you might not want to shell out another couple of dollars for this version, but then again, it's only a couple more bucks for more HIM!<br /> I got this album when it was released in Finland and Germany, which was about 5 days ago, and I've been listening to it non-stop ever since.<br /> If you're a HIM fan, BUY THIS ALBUM.<br />If you want to give HIM a try, Buy this album. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Once again John Le Carre has continued in his unique way to present the reader with a powerful, thought provoking thriller with his usual tinge of cynicism
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved all of the books in this series! I couldnt put the books down...read them all so quickly,I will probably read them several times. Can't wait for the movie!
B006RXQC2Y|5.0|I really like the Movie! It was what I really expected! I recommend it completely! I am very happy! Thank You
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I reccomend getting the first one first to start, but other than that I love it! You need a lot of finger skill and at first you won`t get very far. You can get very addicted to Temple Run. I can`t wait for Temple Run Oz!! (:
072325804X|5.0|I really love the background that is included with each story.  This is the perfect edition to a Beatrix Potter collection.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Just recently re-watched this film and it holds up very well.  I shouldn't be too surprised as it's based on outstanding source material.  Even the special effects look great.  Highly rated.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I cannot describe the highs and lows of this book but I can say it was a heart gripping read. It took me two days to read! I cannot say enough about this book! Definitely one of my favorites!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I really like the Movie! It was what I really expected! I recommend it completely! I am very happy! Thank You
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The writers for this series are very clever! They have the ability to intertwine three or four plots into one fast moving action piece. This series keeps you on your toes and alert. If you have any curiosity for the corrupt nature of Chicago or of the plotting and strategy of a large law firm, The Good Wife is a great choice!
0345529057|5.0|If you are a fan of the tv series and like books, this is well worth the cost. I am thoroughly enjoying these books and they are very well written. The language used is very readable and understandable.
0061537969|5.0|Imagine a heartwarming book narrated by a dog of a certain age. That's the hook to this book: Enzo, something of a mutt tells the story of his human, Denny, a mechanic in an upscale auto shop, who aspires to drive Formula I race cars.<br /><br />The book is Enzo's retrospective as his life draws to a close. The book begins with Denny rescuing puppy Enzo from a less-than-benevolent master, and we watch as Denny marries Eve, and then as daughter Zoe emerges into their lives. Enzo loves them all, of course, but then there are problems. Eve contracts cancer, and there is a serious kerfuffle between Denny and Eve's parents over Eve's welfare as her health declines, and then finally over custody of Zoe.<br /><br />Stein's prose here is occasionally inspired, but his gift to readers is Enzo and his perspective on the humans he becomes close to. The book is both heart-rending and heart-warming, and anyone who enjoys high-end auto racing, dogs, an unusual love story, or family intrigue will find it hard to quit turning pages.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Of course this has been out forever and my husband and I are both in our 50's so we didn't see the need in battling crowds and young ones to see these movies.  We did like this movie.  There was great action!  Held us all the way!
B004F1F32A|5.0|I really like the Movie! It was what I really expected! I recommend it completely! I am very happy! Thank You
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|They roped a good cast into this - and more likely payed them out the ears - but it's awful.  It seems as if it wants to be a \\"Sin City\\"-styled violent live action cartoon, but they don't commit all the way to that and it just comes off as a bad movie with thin plot and characters.
B009NX88JU|5.0|This semi-biographical film is fantastic. Music fans will recognize real people in the characters. For example Pamela Des Barres wrote a book called &#34;I'm with the Band&#34; about her experiences as a member of the (in)famous GTO's, a 70's group of young women who followed rock bands around and &#34;inspired&#34; them. Mrs. Des Barres real life attitude and experiences are more than a little reflected in Miss Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson.
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|The joy of listening to Sam Beam (Iron & Wine) is that you never know what is coming around the corner.  It's usually interesting, often surprisingly spectacular, and always worth revisiting at a later time.<br /><br />It is obvious that Beam has had a variety of life experiences and played with a great variety of musicians over the years.  He seems to have tried to cram every one into this album, mostly with good to great results and otheres that make me want to hit the skip button.  But that's what I like about Beam.<br /><br />You never know what to expect, ranging from something Townes Van Zandt, Marvin Gaye, or a crooner might have done.  I've seen him live twice, once as a solo, once with a large backup band.  As anyone whose's seen him can attest, like a good jazz artist, no two performances are the same.  It will be interesting how these songs will evolve, become part of the Iron & Wine repetoire, or be forgotten on the disk.<br /><br />If I want to listen to his earlier style, there are plenty of albums I can reach for at any time.  So I'm a bit confused by the reviewers who want more of the same.  As I wrote above, I've come to learn to that any Iron & Wine album will be a snapshot in time, not something that will be heard over and over again at every concert.  That's the fun of Beam/Iron & Wine and that's what makes this and future albums interesting to me.  This is a solid album of American music ranging from funky, to songs fit for big bands, to big country ballads, and everything in between.  I can see how some my not like it, but if they've been following his career, they should expect change informed by Beam's experiences, especially with different musicians.

B008JAGZDE|4.0|Expect the usual from American Pie on this one. It's worth watching but it's not much different than other American Pie movies out there. Hopefully this will be the last one in the series from the original American Pie crew.
0440238609|3.0|Perhaps it's because I came into this series with such high expectations, but I came away moderately underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong: It's good. It's just not, in my opinion, great.<br /><br />But first the good: Philip Pullman's vision of an alternate, mirror universe Oxford is both brilliant and vibrant. In fact, it may be my favorite \\"character\\" in the entire series. It breathes with life. I wanted to visit, and I looked forward to opening The Golden Compass each evening to spend a little more time there.<br /><br />I also quite enjoyed the basic parameters of the story, which you no doubt already know by now: The \\"dust,\\" the alternate universes, the subversive questioning of canonical teachings. All wonderful, truly. The pacing, too, works quite well. One is never bored.<br /><br />The not-so-good: I never became fully invested in the characters, and in particular with Lyra, the main character. It's hard to put a finger on it, exactly, because all of the elements of a good character are there. She's feisty, resourceful, brave, and sometimes vulnerable. But is she real? Too often, at least to me, Lyra felt like a by-the-numbers heroine. An afterthought to the greater story Pullman wanted to tell.<br /><br />I give no credence to those who oppose the trilogy because it challenges religion and authority. What better message is there for our children than to challenge the assumptions handed down to them from the past generations? But I do not consider this the masterpiece many others seem to. From an entertainment standpoint, it's hard to stay emotionally invested in the outcome when I cared more for the world-building than I did for the characters who inhabit those worlds.
B0001I562I|5.0|I think this movie gets passed over as a dinky Disney kiddy movie, but I think that's unfair.  While there are elements of that to this movie, the underlying story of a kid collected as a specimen by an alien species is a great story to explore, and it's all done very well.

B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Way too long of a movie. If Judd Apatow made this movie 1.5 hours instead it would have been a lot better. The movie seemed forced at times trying to juggle comedy with serious moments. It's worth a $1 rental if you are bored but I would not pay more than that for this movie.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|To be honest I was not too concerned about all the extra features, I just wanted all of the movies in one Blu-Ray set. I was surprised that I could grab the entire set for only $60.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I originally picked up this book as a check-out at the public library, and when it became available as a Kindle, I had to add it to my collection.<br /><br />The dystopian themes of the book paint a grim picture of the future, with no way out for most individuals.  Corporations have strangled society, government exists mostly to protect the &#34;rights&#34; of those corporations, and the only joy most people have is to be found in the on-line worlds of Oasis, an immersive on-line universe that provides the personal growth and upward mobility and achievement no longer available in the real world. For most, Oasis is real life.  When the fabulously wealthy inventor/designer/mastermind of Oasis dies, he structures his final bequest as a quest to select the one player to win his entire fortune and the right to control the future of Oasis.  Lord of the Rings, meet PlayStation/Xbox/WiiU.<br /><br />Can the individual succeed against overwhelming odds against the arrayed forces of corporate goon squads?  It is a gripping tale told well that works as a darned good story for kids (who might not get all the '80's references) and as a cautionary tale for their parents.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|When it said extended edition, I though I was going to get the extra scenes via a selection in the menu. I am  so glad I was wrong! I loved how the extra scenes were in the actuual movie playing - esp the Rosalie/Dog Bowl scene!!!!! I was disappointed that scene wasn't in the the movie when I saw it in the theatre but I have it now!!
B007AL48UK|5.0|I recommend this game to anyone who like to play Mahjohg. It make you sit and think about the move in the game.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I have a strange relationship with books and their film adapted counterparts; I usually am completely engulfed by one and jaded by the other. But then there are pairs that are both equally amazing. AK is one of them. Honestly, I had never heard of the story of AK until I saw the previews for this movie. Then I read the book and HAD to see the movie! I love the cinematography- I felt like I was watching a stage play and a feature film simultaneously. Absolutely. Wonderful. Keira Knightley's performance is genius- if you loved Pride & Prejudice and The Duchess, you'll love this.

B00B23O96A|5.0|If I was stranded in traffic somewhere, I'd be fine. He's done it again with yet another cd I can listen to all day long.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I absolutley love this app. it is especially fun getting to see all of the underwater creatures. Also being able to see your hark grow and evolve into a bigger shark.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|Direction and acting are quite superb. The plot worls, and it is a wonderful period work that most will enjoy.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A great English period drama with quite a bit of humor in it that the whole family can watch! I have enjoyed every episode of this season!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Definitely recommend I could not put it down.<br />I hope there's a second book to find out what else happens between Charlie and Sam.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|This short story is a quick, easy and very fun read from the author of \\"The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club,\\" which I read a few weeks ago and just loved! His most recent story is written in the same dark comedy and at times tongue-in-cheek manner of his novel. And, like his Ladies Dog Walking Club, the characters are very vivid and no matter how flawed they are, he presents them to us without judgment and with a surprising amount of humanity. There is always the irony of the consequences of small moments in our lives in Mr. Whitehead's writing, and I like that. As in his Gordonston book, there is a mystery here, but it's not the focus of this entertaining read, however I won't tell you any more as I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. Enjoy this short read, then treat yourself to his full novel - you won't regret it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is my daily alarm and it never fails to wake me when I need it. If only there was a differential equations setting.
1932100660|5.0|This was an excellent, science based book on nutrition and health. I read it after it was mentioned in the health documentary, Forks Over Knives, and every page is presently logically and scientifically. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about nutrition, how to improve their health, and fight disease.
B00C32R64G|5.0|This is the best new band i have heard in years and years!!!<br />I will purchase all of there cds
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It allows you to change the font and if your looking for something and don't know where it is you can search key words. It also has tons of reading plans. The only thing I don't like is it needs wifi.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|What can I say it was fun, short but totally worth it. I love the mystery of the story and I can`t wait to see where it goes. I really hope the next part comes out soon I truly can`t wait for the next game.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Not the best Stephen King book I've read but it is still good. I feel like the ending was a little tame for hiss type of writing.
B004IPPINW|4.0|Everything we see isn't necessarily as seen through the eyes and life of others around us.  This story facilitates us seeing how others with different cultural life experiences define interpersonal relationships of love and loss. Can we understand this pattern of thinking? These same eyes see the tragedy of 9/11 ascribing different reasoning to this happening whilst also understanding the American perspective. Again - can we understand this pattern of thinking? Would we actually think differently coming from the same life circumstances as Changez?<br /><br />This story will give you much to think about and mull over especially once you read the final few pages.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It kept me on my seat the whole movie.  It was a shame that it was not in the academy awards.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Though it can't help but show its age, it does so much more gracefully than most sci fi films of the 1950's.<br />You can readily see its influence on 1960's sci fi with its transporter beams, robots, and pyschologically based plots.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm an 8th grader an i readthis book. It was a really great book. It was actually really the first book I read from cover to cover. It was so great that at time i could relate to Augie, but then remember what he looks like. This book had a great flow. It is a easy read, and I didn't want to put it down. Thanks for catching my eye with you ads.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|It played wonderfully in theaters but at home, it's just as intriguing.<br />You can['t beat John Le Carre's words.<br />Tops!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game it is so addictive and free. lol.<br />When im at work ppl say what are u doing because my body be tilting lol. Now I have my coworkers playing it. We all tilting now.
B008OOYALE|2.0|My kid loves this game and there are a lot of nice things I could say about it, however they're overshadowed by the negatives.  This is the only game where he is constantly asking to spend real money.  More importantly, the game.crashes.  Even worse, it keeps the tablet from going to sleep.  So the game is stuck on an error page constantly playing music until the battery dies or I force stop.
0307346617|5.0|The zombie aspect makes it more fun to read, but this book is thoughtful and interesting social commentary. How would different aspects of human society respond to a fast-spreading lethal virus, such as smallpox or ebola or an airborne fast-acting version of AIDS? What would happen to military, economy, refugees, family life, entertainment/history/propaganda, first-world life without electricity, food production, religion, survival job retraining, mental health, parenting, environment?<br /><br />Looking forward to the movie too... Novel was strange enough that they would have had to majorly rework it for screen.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I originally picked up this book as a check-out at the public library, and when it became available as a Kindle, I had to add it to my collection.<br /><br />The dystopian themes of the book paint a grim picture of the future, with no way out for most individuals.  Corporations have strangled society, government exists mostly to protect the &#34;rights&#34; of those corporations, and the only joy most people have is to be found in the on-line worlds of Oasis, an immersive on-line universe that provides the personal growth and upward mobility no longer found in &#34;real life&#34;.  For most, Oasis is real life.  When the fabulously wealthy inventor/designer/mastermind of Oasis dies, he structures his final bequest as a quest to select the one player to win his entire fortune and the right to control the future of Oasis.  Lord of the Rings, meet PlayStation/Xbox/WiiU.<br /><br />Can the individual succeed against overwhelming odds against the arrayed forces of corporate goon squads?  It is a gripping tale told well that works as a darned good story for kids (who might not get all the '80's references) and as a cautionary tale for their parents.
0792164903|5.0|I love  this movie I been looking for it for yrs and now I haver found it and own it  thank you so much you are the best Amazon if it wasn't you I would be looking for ever thank you
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is our favorite movie to watch on the 3D TV! We love Avatar. We are so happy to have this collection in our home.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Funny show, like being able to watch the episodes back-to-back and all in correct order (just started watching it, so starting from Season One on through). I also like the show well enough to know that I'll be watching the seasons again in the future, so buying is better than renting in this case.
B006EAG4G4|3.0|This is a good book if you want to read a classical. It is free at Kindle store and good for your kids
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The music and ambiance of the game are incredible.  It is simple enough to start with that you can get into it and really develop skills with the controls, but continues to get hard enough to require you to continue to develop and use all of your skill.  The way it randomizes levels over and over again make it a compelling game to come back to again and again.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A lot of research went into this book and I liked it a lot.  A new slant on the brave acts of the soldiers on WW II. I would recommend it.
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book last year and within 5 months lost 45 lbs.  I learned a lot about the food I was eating, why it was inhibiting weight loss (I was already exercising regularly but gaining weight), and what to eat to begin a legitimate and safe reduction in weight.  When I stuck to the diet, I lost several pounds per week.  When I didn't, I saw no loss, or gained weight.  I didn't need any more evidence than that to recognize how helpful this book is.  It's changed the way I choose to eat for the rest of my life.  I'm healthier and happier and stronger now than ever before.  I recommend this book to everyone I know that's dieting or constantly working out to lose weight.  Diet to lose weight, exercise to get fit.  Don't kill yourself in the gym and expect to lose weight if you're still eating a lot of sugars and flours and worthless foods.  If you have the will to change your crappy diet, you can lose all the weight you need to.  I'm at a healthy weight now, and don't need to be quite as strict with the diet to maintain it, but I will forever be cognizant of the type and quality of foods I consume, thanks to this book.  I did not need any of the fancy gadgets he recommends to monitor progress. I only used Wii Fit to weigh myself daily, and I stuck to the diet.  Weight loss was inevitable.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I like historical fiction and this does the job for me. I am intrigued by the character development and descriptions of current culture and the impending changes that are occurring.  I am about half way through the book
B00683JLXA|1.0|I could not get the controls to function properly at all, rendering the game unplayable.  After finally getting it to function somewhat the game was, at best, semi-playable.  This may be unique to me and may be resolved by re-installing the program, but I didn't even want to after.  I checked my other games and the phone generally and concluded that this was not a hardware issue.  The game seems fun in concept a knock-off of angry birds which is a knock-off of the castle crushing game from Armor Games.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I watched a clip of this movie on channel 9 this week and I fall in love with it, I ordered right away from Amazon.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really liked this movie until the last. Twenty seconds. I hated the ending. I understand why there are so many loose ends due to the sequels that follow, but I think it could have been tied up a little better. I just started reading the book last night to see if the book leaves you hanging as well. I would recommend this movie.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I like it because it is attractive, functional and hardy..  It has a pocket which I use regulary for notes, telephone number I use for access to Kindle support.
B003ZDO90G|4.0|I am not a great fan of short stories but Alice Munro's 'Too Much Happiness' held my attention all the way through.  One or two of the stories were a little disappointing but I leaved her last four.
B008133MDK|5.0|One of the best series out there. 5 Stars across the board. Extraordinary scripts, casting, acting.  Do yourself a favor and get onboard.
B00AJLHUAS|4.0|There are some great musicians on here playing in the traditional old style of the 20's and 30's, like I remember from my Dad's old collections.  You can hear new nuggets of brilliance from these musicians each time you listen.  Funny, how sometimes they don't know how to end a song, but I like it!
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandson who is nine years old really enjoyed playing this and wants to continue because he thinks games are fun.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|Just picked up the new cd by Tom Keifer and it is great. I can't wait to see him in concert.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I own these in hard cove but have since come to loathe carrying around books. With the TV show that is coming along quite nicely I picked these up and am actually really enjoying them on the E-Reader I use instead of the hard cover copies I own. When book 6 comes out I will buy it through amazon as I like the format better.<br /><br />Good show!
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Continues the tradition of Bond movies, with Daniel Craig again showing why he is worthy of the role.  Like the way it ties together previous elements from past movies.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I would recommend this product because my grandson could not stop playing it and liked the different levels of play.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I love Daniel Pink's books, and this one is great! We are all, after all, in sales, one way or another, and I think he captured this very well. Read it! Now!
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Excellent acting and a well developed story.  Worth while watching from Prime video.  Excellent streaming with no problems with video or audio.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Loved the story as well as the emphasis on the student part of &#34;student athletes&#34;.  Samuel L. Jackson is perfect for the role as coach.  Nice ending too, as it wasn't just a pollyanna story.
B0015AARJI|4.0|They products were as advertised and are performing great.  The whole family can now enjoy playing the PS3 games that are available in multiplayer.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I found this to be a very current topic book, that says a lot about our modern day work world. Read it!
B00A9Q70Y4|5.0|Missed this episode, so I had to buy it ... I couldn't watch the rest until I did :)  Love the Walking Dead!!
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|I liked the movie a lot.  There were times it seems to rattle around with no theme, but then it would bounce back and make sense. The movie is all about feelings and life and I am so glad it had a happy ending.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|So many reader apps are useless, this one is seamless transition from Google reader.  It is consistant across all platforms as I access it through Chrome on my laptop as well.
1452115567|5.0|i loved this book. the photos were cute and funny. i would recommend this book to any age. it was a great book to look at. not may words but the photos were cool. i used to own coonhounds.
B000001FKY|5.0|I loved this group!! I loved them when I was younger and wanted the original vs the mixed version CD. Great album!!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This is a great app for homework help. I find it very helpful. Definitely recommend it. So that is all I've got.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Feel and look of product is okay on first impression. Kind of, well, flimsy. Went together well, and seem secure. So secure that we tested it in a glass of water. It worked! But, that was the first and last good point! The \\"waterproof\\" speaker and microphone ports worked so well that it was very hard for people to hear me talk. Then it happened! The first accidental drop. I dropped it in one of my college classes from the desktop to a tile floor. I now had 2 extra pieces to my phone cover and it obviously won't keep out water anymore. Broke right where the hinge is for the charger on the bottom, so as soon as i need to plug in the charger, I now had 3 pieces. That piece came off too. Read the reviews on Amazon, believe the 1 stars and do what I did, go back to Otter.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this whole series but this season is exceptional!  I didn't expect it to be this good this season. What a pleasant surprise.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle games and this one, although short, May be the coolest one I've ever played.  I fully recommend this game.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I loved the cast and in theory, this should have been a good movie. It was just very depressing. It seemed redundant and there was a lot of yelling. Not as funny as the trailers made it out to be. It definitely wasn't &#34;Knocked Up II&#34;.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is not a &#34;how to succeed&#34; handbook, but rather a list of items to be conscious of as a woman in the workforce.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Exactly what i wanted; I was a little confused by the product description. It did not quite describe the whole product in detail and that left me a little hazy on whether to buy it or not. When it came though it was all that i wanted, so it worked out.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Extremely straight forward no hassle challenging fun. Very User friendly. Addictive sums the entire experience up when you posy this app.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|These folks bring down the house and their not even here.  Love the Soul they bring to every song and the lyrics keep me shakin' my hips.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Story of human suffering and human pride.  Kept you rooting for the main character and his search for freedom from the poverty he grew up in.
B00007KQA3|5.0|This film is perfect for anyone who wants to see what the future of mankind might be like.  It takes place in, as the title implies, the year 1984.  This was far into the future from the time George Orwell wrote the novel in the late 1940's.  The entire film has a dreary, unhappy, but very interesting plot as it describes a time when an iron-fisted Socialist government, led by &#34;Big Brother,&#34; has absolute, 24/7 control of every activity of its citizens.  The gloomy atmosphere is enhanced by the use of mainly dull black, gray,  brown, and blue colors throughout.  There is rarely a day when the sun shines.  The main plot concerns a forbidden love affair between Winston Smith and Julia, two anti-Big Brother government employees who attempt to hide their trysts from the ever-prowling eyes of &#34;BB&#34; and his Thought Police.  In this reviewer's opinion, &#34;1984&#34; is one of the best movies of its genre ever produced.  Highly recommended!
1400069807|3.0|The book is broken into three sections each one about sugar, fat and salt. In short Mr. Moss takes us behind the scenes of the food industry where they have exploited the human desire to crave salt and our love affair with sugar and fat. I thought it was interesting how the food companies are not demonized just ignorant of what is happening beyond the making of the `perfect product'.  Some of the really interesting points are about cheese and how the government bought it the excessive leftover amounts then it became a subsidy so companies marketed it and about a decade later we put cheese on everything, I believe the author said we have tripled individual consumption to like 35 pounds a year since the late 1970's. It was also interesting how the food industry has calculated the \\"bliss point\\" this is the point where a specific concentration of salt, sugar or fat makes the food most palatable (i.e. not salty enough - to little salt, to rich or to greasy - to much fat, just the right amount of sugar - bliss). Likewise I was disgusted at Paula Deen's recipe for deep fried macaroni balls made from Kraft Mac & Cheese wrapped in bacon.<br /><br />There is no doubt this book is well researched and I greatly admire his tenacity to follow up on so many leads. However these leads become circular so it takes forever to get to the facts and then once you get to the bottom line you feel a bit left to figure out what come next. For example he talks about how companies have worked to get people hooked and now we have heavy users so what next for them and how could one identify themselves? Any advice outside of go cold turkey? Another example is when he makes this really poignant argument about how a person who is morbidly obese has gastric bi-pass surgery which is successful only to come home and still have the same cravings but a smaller stomach. It would have been great to hear that person's side of the story.  So while it is still a depressing look into the food industry where profit is more important than people sadly the overall topic is nothing new. In the section on salt he starts talking about the different types of salt additives and I thought that was really interesting because it was consumer usable information only to have it end without any significant discussion.<br /><br />I listened to this book on audio and Scott Brick is awesome as always. The writing is solid but to be honest at times I felt the book got a little repetitive and at times I was challenged to fully focus.<br /><br />If you are new to the food industry I think this could really open one's eyes to what is happening behind the scenes. If you have read a few books then it may seem a bit redundant.<br /><br />3 ½ stars
B00962UJ22|5.0|After all these twenty years, hearing another great album from Anglagard is just unbelievable. They did it again! They again showed what progressive music realy is. As it was in their former albums (in my opinion, together with the Anekdotens Nucleus, Epilog is one of the greatest albums of entire rock history) compositions are very melodic and complex. Something happens in every second of the album. Sound of the group as clear as classic music even when they play hard, which makes them uniq. I recommend this album to everyone who looks for progressive music in the real sense of the word.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a nice version of solitaire. Its a nice way to pass the time quickly. Easy to use and understand. I wish it had more versions like free cell and spider, but all in all it is what it claims to be, just solitaire.
B008JFUO36|4.0|Cruise and crew offer a lot to like in \\"Oblivion.\\" It starts out simply enough - Jack (Cruise's character) and Victoria live quietly enough, handling repairs of the robots that protect the mining operations. The back-story all makes sense: alien invaders some time back, Earth fought them off, but the population had to leave the ruined planet. A few pockets of invaders remain, the \\"scavengers\\"  who sabotage the robots and mining, but seem little more than nuisances. Jack and Vicca carry on, looking forward to rejoining the rest of humanity at the end of their stint.<br /><br />But, one by one, the pieces of this story fall apart. The scavengers aren't who Jack was told they are, their controllers aren't who they thought, and even Jack and Vicca aren't who they thought. Each time part of the story falls away, something deeper and darker takes its place, including plot elements reminiscent of [[ASIN:B0030B621W Moon]].<br /><br />It has all you could hope in the way of big-budget effects, gadgets, and action, but a real plot, too. If this is the start of the year's \\"summer movies,\\" it promises to be a very good year.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Very entertaining. Brilliant dancing. Great laughs. Wonderful way to spend 1 hour 45 minutes. Gene Kelly is not only great but gorgeous. Donald O'Connor is very funny and Debbie is enchanting.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game!!  The challenges make it even more fun.  You do have to earn pearls to accomplish some of them, but they give you ten to begin with.  It does take some patience, but I like that because it makes me want to play it more!  If you love Disney like I do, you should get this app!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|My 1st one was no good out of the box. I don't know why. I contacted Soundfly and they shipped another one . I have used this one for about 3 weeks and it performs perfectly. I have only used a usb stick and have only briefly tried the other functions, but have had no problems.<br /> One of the neatest things that I have found out is, if you forget to use the bookmark function, before turning off the ignition, it always starts at the beginning of that last song. If you choose the bookmark function, before turning off the ignition, it starts play exactly where you set the bookmark time.<br /> As I am writing this review I have listened to 11 Folders, each containing 25 songs per folder and have never had a problem.<br />I have never used one of these before, but I think it is a very good purchase, if all you want to do is listen to your recorded music and not hear commercials.<br />Get one you will love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best version so far, rocked the first one looking forward to playing more!  Definitely worth downloading this application today!! Enjoy
B0060D15AK|5.0|This comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds was really great! There was a lot of chemistry between the main characters and among the rest of the cast. The storyline was interesting and is about a topic that is making the headlines today. The bottom-line is that everybody in the world even those who say they don't want to become American citizens so they can enjoy the freedoms and liberties we all here in these United States love! So Margaret a hard charging book editor who is all business finds herself in a jam. This is where the proposal comes in between her executive secretary and her for a quick marriage and later within a year a quickie divorce. Why? Well she is a Canadian in this country with an expired work visa. What will she do? This is where Sandra and Ryan cook up this harebrained scheme, which is very thin. Then they both fly to Sitka, Alaska for the weekend to visit with Ryan’s folks. During the weekend she experiences a loving family and falls in love. Ryan does too! They both had not planned on this development in their temporary arrangement. As Sandra kept saying, &#34;It's only a business deal.&#34;  So what happens? Well, see it and enjoy! I really loved it! So I gave it fives stars! If you are looking for light comedy with moments that make you feel good and memories are made of than this movie is for you.
B007SGM084|1.0|I wouldn't even consider this a romance novel.  It was more very badly written cheap porn.<br /><br />I should start out by saying that I read a little of everything. I could even read the back of a cereal box! I am always looking for my next book and read every genre. So saying this, I love a good romance novel along with the next person!<br /><br />When I say it was badly written, I mean it was horrible! Basically Anastasia falls in love with a multi billionaire, Christian Gray. Ana was a virgin and Christian roughly takes her virginity. He wants her to be his submissive at first but then supposedly falls in love with her. I don't know how or why he is in love with her because the only thing they do is fight and have sex. Seriously...I've been married for six years and I swear they have more sex in these three books then I have my entire marriage. It was to the point that I would skip over sex scenes and pages even just so I can find some sort of story. There really wasn't any. He was abused as a child, and she has extreme and frequent conversations with both her inner goddess and her subconscious. I mean good God...I read something about her inner goddess on almost every page.<br /><br />Everybody says to get past the first book and the real story comes in during the second one. Not true. There is no story line. He likes to beat on her, and she begins to enjoy it. I didn't finish the trilogy, and it was a waste of my time to even start it.<br /><br />Worst books I've ever read hands down!
B003CN4R74|5.0|Love the entire disk. Her voice is very powerful, the lyrics are very moving and the music is exceptional. Best heard LOUD!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game. Smoth gameplay, pretty good graphics. Great way to kill a few minutes of spare time. Daily challenges add decent replay value.
1595825045|5.0|This book is fantastic for anyone who loved the show and even better for people who love art & process. Bryan and Mike walk us through the tremendous amount of work it takes to produce an animated series of this caliber. Great coffee table book quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This my favorite games of all time because I like how every month the place you run at changes and that you get new people and new boards
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandson asked for this for my kindle, we both love it play all the time. Great eye hand coordination.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Movie was awesome.<br /><br />Amazon needs to work on their video quality though. Dark scenes were terrible visually--compression made them almost cartoonish.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for next season!!!  Great show, I will buy it again next season.  Please alert me when the new season starts.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Two dinomite musicans in top form. Great selection of funky, grovey blues. My favorites, I'd Rather Go Blind, and a Billie Holiday classic, Don't Explain, are exceptional.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it ah lot...Works like it should, no more 2 argue about...If ya need ah good alarm app choose this 1 but this is my own opinion; check it out &amp; go from there
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Three things, one is after a drawing the only comment given is drawsome. Two, It does not show how long ago the other player played. Three, it does not show special categories. Other than that good game
0345803493|5.0|It was a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  It made me itch to read the third and wish there was a fourth!
B000PDYVVG|4.0|There are a lot of criticisms of this book.  I almost didn't buy it.  Read the book and enjoy it for what it is.  A chronicle of a woman's experience.  It's not a great work of literature but it has its value.  I am finding that I relate quite well to her experiences and it is comforting to me.  Now I want to see the movie.
B009CCBCU4|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, however I did not fall in  love with it. I especially enjoyed reading interactions between the Highlander Kuini with the First daughter of the Second  Wife, the Aztec Warlord and his childhood friend.  Primarily, I think it is not being a die hard fan of the genre.  I am not familiar with the information so the names and places were a little hard to keep straight.  I did find the editing was done fairly well.  There is nothing more detracting than coming across spelling and gramatical errors...totally ruins the momentum of the story or the mood the author is trying to set.  There were a few phrases over used.  Overall this I do not regret reading and may continue with the series.  I would recommend this book.
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Either you'll like this movie or you'll think it's so-so and will only watch it once.  But I loved it.  I loved the suspense, which actually isn't that great compared to today's movies that add so much more into them (and in my opinion, sometimes too much).  But I love Robert Redford no matter what he's in so maybe that's pregidous on my part toward the movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Let me just say this, I am a &#34;regular&#34; guy. I drive a 40 year old pick-up truck and drink beer. I am not in to musicals, or Broadway shows, or even reality television or America's next top ANYTHING. That being said, I got this copy of Le Miserables for my girlfriend, and reluctantly sat down to watch it with her. The movie started, and from the first FIVE MINUTES I was drawn in, and completely blown away! This is a movie that should be seen by every person, in school, at work, in prison, everywhere. I could not believe the attention to detail, and the collective talent that went in to this &#34;event&#34; I witnessed. The actors and actresses's singing alone was so incredible, so moving, I am sure I will NEVER forget this performance, and I will continue to tell everyone to see it for themselves, it will blow your mind. Watch the first five minutes, you have never seen anything like this.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Another technically impressive Jackson effort. My may complaint has to do with the tendency of screen writers to seriously alter works of acclaimed literature. The Hobbit did not require improving. Fun and exciting otherwise.
B00371XIP8|1.0|I cannot remember how old I was when I first watched the original Boondock saints. I can honestly say that it was a part of my childhood and a movie I watched countless times through college. I remember a younger, more innocent, albeit naive me that was thrilled and overjoyed at the prospect of a sequel to my favorite movie of all time, and I followed Duffy blogs on the internet until this project was given a green light. I remember my giddy excitement. I also remember the state of denial that I was in after watching this movie in its theatrical release. It was as if an old friend had breathed his last, and my brain refused to accept the concept that he was being put six feet under before my very eyes, refused to believe that the dirt being piled upon it was real, that his flesh would become food for the worms and (a bright side) fertilizer for the soil. This movie broke my heart. They say that time heals all wounds, and indeed, a sufficient amount of time has passed and my mind has been able to accept the fact that this movie absolutely blows and has destroyed a piece of my innocence that I will never recover, but even thinking about this movie is like tearing open a scab, and the wound bleeds anew. What a shame. However, life goes on, and we continue to grow, until the day our bodies are buried and decay alongside my hopes and dreams for an awesome Boondock saints sequel.
B009BJATYS|5.0|The character portrayals are warm, a good match.  The summation of Jane's, Emma's and Frank's early life and how they are &#34;linked&#34; together was well done.  Humorous, happy, Michael Gambon is wonderful as Mr. Woodhouse, staying true to his convictions.
B00846REIS|2.0|What a terrible book!!! It's a Total copy of &#34;50 Shades of Gray,&#34; just not as good. Story is pathetic, writing is not very good. I'm annoyed with myself for reading the whole thing. The characters are lame, the story is boring.
B005LLX582|2.0|Expected good film with good Christian content. Was only highly philosophical, very humanistic, loooong periods of silence and basically no content. Far too much darkness. Some lovely photography if this was a travelogue, but that was the only redeeming feature.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I now have all three movies.I found it as funny as the last two.I love watching it over and over
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|ON my tablet, this is a huge display. Great for tired, old eyes like mine. It works very well. I will be adding this to my business iPad soon.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Was suggested as a good series to read while waiting for the next George R. R. Martin book. While it is nowhere as deep or complex as 'Fire & Ice' it is an enjoyable enough series. Characters are not as well drawn as I'd hoped, but slowly I came to like them. By the second book I even began to get a clearer picture of them and began to want to know how they fared. Easy to read and a nice mix of perspectives from the various characters meant I flew through the book, then the next one, and the next is already half read. So a vote with my wallet would suggest a worthwhile book / series. 4 stars? Yes I liked it!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|To big Big expectation?  in fact this film is boring. No action, only talking talking. i was desapointed soory lincoln<br />.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Reading this book got me to start reading the entire series! It has a lot of adventure and still hasn't gotten old yet.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie is a spectacular depiction of one act Lincoln did to help make our country what it is today. A must see!
B0050PYNP8|1.0|Isn't this just a rip-off of Roger from American Dad!? Yes, I think it is. Only Roger is a million times funnier and fun to watch.<br />No creativity here.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|this is a great game a lot of fun and has no flaws defiantly should download. lots of strategy and other sorts of war tactics
B00005JPO1|5.0|Can't go wrong with an Indiana Jones movie. Loved this movie and I think it was a great addition to the trilogy. Great DVD with special features.
B00BHMF578|5.0|definite must see.  Good to see a well written script based on a true story.  We thoroughly enjoyed the movie
B005LAII0S|5.0|This is one of those movies that I felt I had to have in my collection.  Snow White with a little humor and a twist.  Most definitely not the Disney version.  Julie Andrews was wonderful (of course) as the evil step mother queen.  And Nathan Lane; well he did what he does, adds that touch he has.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|True to the word. One of the best syfy novels ever to be written. If you are a syfy fan you can only love this book
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm not a big &#34;series&#34; watcher- or soap operas for that matter.  I just started watching Downton Abbey and LOVE it!  The costumes, scenery, and dynamics of the family and servants is addictive.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really love the game. It's fun and addictive and my children ages 7 and 9 also love it.  Am having the same problems as everyone else with adding friends and unfortunately you have to spend real money to pass some of the quests but other than that it's a really great game!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an incredible book. The characters are very easy to relate to, and I found the protagonist insightful, though most times never when it came to do with his own issues. This was an important read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can' t wait to see the next show. Unbelievable photography and settings. The main characters are bring their roles to life.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This film MUST be watched in 3D . it just looks and feels better . the movie if self is good . not as good as any LOTR films but still a great part of a journey to watch . the 7.1 Audio and the 3D video makes this Blu-ray a MUST OWN for any fantasy adventure fan .or anyone with a good taste with some forgiveness.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. I finished it in only a few days as I was unable to put it down. The story is exciting and gripping. I really enjoyed the science and problem solving skills woven throughout. The main character was relatable as well as humorous. I wish I could read it again for the first time. A fantastic read! Enjoy.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|The Timers4Me is an excellent app that I installed on my smart phone. It is great looking as well as very user friendly. I almost always carry my cell phone with me, so I always have a work, kitchen and nap timer and stop watch with me. It's great and I love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When my husband who doesn't read books unless I force him to mentioned this series I was hugely skeptical.  Especially when it comes to sci-fi.  I haven't read a decent sci-fi in years and to find this gem from a startup author has me very excited and renewed my faith in amazon self publishers :).  I've avoided self published authors because despite positive reviews the books flat out suck.  This series does not suck!  This amazing author is right up there with the big league authors in his masterful story telling and AMAZING character development.  Even down to the no name little guy I found myself attached to each character and riding along on this emotional journey through a post apocalyptic world.  Without a doubt I am in love with Hugh Howeys work and I look forward to the rest of this series and any new work he has in store.  This tale is sci-fi history in the making and Hugh should be extremely proud!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have a new favorite book. This book is like a decadent chocolate for your brain. It is sumptuous. If I could only pick one book to live in, it would be this one. I didn't want it to end.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I decded to read it because it sold more than million copies and i was curious about it. reads nicely
0937381888|5.0|I decided to buy this book only after I brewed my first beer. I was so infatuated with brewing beer after that, I decided to gain a deeper knowledge about it. This book will take you though everything from brewing extract to all-grain and beyond. This book seemed to cover everything you could ever want to know about brewing. Some things are still above my head but hopefully the knowledge I gained from reading the book, will start to click the more in depth I go with brewing. Bottom line... as a beginner, you cant go wrong with this book.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|Originally, I did not want to watch this series - it didn't appeal to me: &#34;serial killer working inside Miami Metro&#34;<br />However, my incredible roommate - who may have a stomach for this being a: Cardiovascular Intensive Care Nurse - told me I would love it!<br />When our Netflix failed to arrive on a Friday - she went to work - and so did I .... starting season one with a bottle of red wine ... it was: phenomenal - was still watching in the late a.m.<br />To say the very least - this is and always will be my favorite series on - Showtime - or HBO.<br /><br />Love IT!!!!!!
B001HBYHFA|1.0|My family had seen this movie at a cousin's house and have laughed about it ever since. Deciding that I needed to experience the ridiculousness that is &#34;Serenity&#34;, we rented it for the evening.  They were absolutely right. Mediocre sets, randomly odd camera angles, writing that seemed to come straight from a Jr. High boy's journal, and really, really, poor acting come together to make the cheesiest movie to hit the screen since &#34;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&#34;. Every sci fi  cliché ever written was thrown together along with an unending line of boring and overdramatic monologues to make a movie that brought me anything but serenity.  The lead character &#34;River&#34; (yes, the name should warn you) was a cross between a Minority Report precog and a high school drama queen loving to be the center to of attention but trying to act like she wasn't. I remember when the Avenger movie was in the works and we heard that Joss Whedon was going to direct.  My family was so disappointed.  Now I know why.  (We actually LOVED the Avenger movie - so either Joss learned his lessons or the great actors of the Avengers stepped in to help make that movie a success.)  If you just have to watch this movie, then enjoy the comedy of it as a sci fi spoof. You cannot take this one seriously. I can't explain the high ratings it seems to get - an &#34;Emperor's New Clothes&#34; effect, I think. Either that or it is Jr. High boys doing the ratings. In true Serenity fashion I could end this with a long overdramatic monologue that really makes little sense, but instead I'll just tell you - skip this cheddar and go straight to the Avengers.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Are you going to place these movies in theater s??? Thanks for Letting me watch these movies, this movie is justified.
B00004Z459|5.0|I always loved Linkin Park. My Cd got damaged so i bought another one and i was so excited that you had it avaliable :) thanks guys!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Awesome! Graphics are great.... unexpected surprises... terrific puzzles... great navigation to different areas which require revisiting to get all pieces.... interesting story... HO games have multiple elements helping to increase challenge and fun.... highly recommended.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|farrah Fawcett is in here.<br />great retro sci-fi with a relevant tie to today with our excessive old population.<br />solve the problem - Logans Run. kill em they're useless and eat up money and resources.<br />kill them kindly and everyone wins...<br />no need for social security or Medicare anymore.<br />genius movie ahead of its time.<br /><br />For transparency sake (?) -- I'd be gone through \\"Carousel\\" at this point.  I crossed the age line.<br />So -- nothing against older people -- I'm one of them -- and the review is a little cheeky, but so is the movie... so...enjoy...
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Really enjoyed this story.  Mainly because there wasn't so much time spent on his alcohol problems as in the Oslo trilogy. He's meant to be a detective and if he got drunk and turned up for work (if he actually made it) he'd be thrown out on his ear. In saying that I think it's a good part of the story if it''s just two or thee times after traumatic events
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|I was hoping for a good Deep Purple new project. And after just one listen it has not disapponinted me. The music is different, not what it was in 1972 but how can it be, Deep Purple has been out there for 45 years. There are places in many of the songs that just grabs your attention, and you know that as only Deep Purple can do it, turn that song into a 15 minute song. Glad I purchased the digital download on the day of release, first Deep Purple album that I have ever done that. Keep on Rockin' Deep Purple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|this game is loaded with hidden object games but there are very few puzzles. storyline seems disjointed. not overly impressed.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|While the book could still use more details into the state of the country, the elite proved a book I could not put down. I am very much anticipating the next book!
B00846WWVM|2.0|My son gets frustrated with this game. Its not my favorite either. The flooding and spraying requires both hands on a touch screen it can be a pain with the sensitivity.
B002U3CB5M|5.0|I loved this book it had great substance and you did not know where it would lead you next. Would recommend it to anybody who likes an intriguing read.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|I play a lot of these games and was certainly glad I opted to try it free first. Most games you quickly get a feel for the set up and movements as well ad how objects and/or puzzles are incorporated into the game. You can figure out the navigation or an idea of what movements to take to obtain what you need. This game provides some hints but very difficult to address certain items. For the first time I actually researched cheats only to find there are none. Glad I fir not purchase... a let down for someone who loves these games.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|This app is one of the best apps around if you shop on line, which I do a lot of the days at 70+ years old.

B002RI9SC4|5.0|I've now completed the Twilight Saga and I'm now so sad. I wish they could go on forever. These books - like the movies - have become a part of me, and I don't regret purchasing them. The Kindle version was great! Really great books Miss Meyer!
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|One of the best new shows on television, all of the actors do an amazing job.  It's a cerebral show and I love that about it.  Can't wait to see how the season plays out and I hope more people watch it so it remains on air.  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This game is all kinds of fun.  I enjoyed it as did my adult daughter and teen-age son.  Kind of addictive.  Fund for family play as well.  Great on Kindle HD.
B00881PTRC|5.0|couldn't figure it out at first, but after a few times, it was like a oh yeh, now i get it
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is the ultimate storyteller.  Who would have thought that a master of the horror genre could write such an engaging and unbelievably creative novel about a historical event etched in so many of our memories.  He weaves an incredible story of travel back in time that causes even the lead character to cry over what has been and what could have been.
0345803493|5.0|This book was more than I expected it to be, meeting all expectations and then some. Can't wait for part 3
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This game is all kinds of fun.  I enjoyed it as did my adult daughter and teen-age son.  Kind of addictive.
0882847953|5.0|I have found it easy to follow.  I have been a drummer since I was twelve but a poor reader.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of the horror genre, so I've never read a Stephen King book before. But this volume is a brilliantly realized story that's an intriguing cross between historical novel and science fiction -- two of my favorites. And I couldn't put it down. The writing is smooth and accessible; the story is humorous in spots, heart-wrenching in others and always engaging. It's impossible to remain disconnected with the plot's central question: is it possible to change the course of history? Loved the characters and their development. On finishing the novel, I was compelled to flip back two chapters and re-read the conclusion. I've been thinking about the story -- and the possibilities it covers -- ever since.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|The continuing hidden dangers are exciting. The story and acting keeps the continuity meanful. I can hardly wait for time to see the next chapter. The video and sound is excellent, both inspiring and frightening. I was motivated to go the water and hear the surf.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I was so inspired by this read!  If you are a runner, this is a must read.  It is entertaining, and informative.  I am NOT a runner, but a wanna-be, and started trying the barefoot method (walking, light jogging) while reading this book.  I could not put this down!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It just seems to take a lot of energy to do each task so you cant play for to long. I also wish you could open up the other rooms quicker instead of having to play the same rooms over and over for days until you reach a certain level. But overall not to bad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a standard calculator, love that it was free, and I have had no problems with it! There are adds that appear on the top.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was the cutest movie! It was funny and had a little bit of action to it, but I loved that it taught a lesson as well.
B00985E3UG|4.0|You'll never eat the same way after reading this book. If you do, you will feel terrible and guilty, knowing how we are all being manipulated by the big food/tobacco companies.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Not a big Star Trek person but like Chris Pine and wanted to see it. I was very happy with the movie and look forward to the new one coming out. I also liked that my 9 1/2 year old was able to watch it - no swearing/sex/nudity. Very well done.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Lacked any semblance of a Grisham novel. Reads like yet another &#34;made for a major motion picture&#34; book. Weak, transparent plot - could see through it too early in the book. Would not recommend.
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|I really liked that movie! The characters in the movie were unknown, but still it was a good thriller! Good movie!
B009YMNVMO|5.0|Good movie . Good print must watch movie I and my kid almost watch every week once which keeps us time pass expecting rio 2 soon
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was good. It was fascinating to see how close my imagination when reading the book coincided with the director's imaginings! The movie however does not reflect the internal struggle and conflict that Catniss felt about the games, and the two men in her life which was a significant part of the book.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|We found that the story did its best, perhaps a bit lacking in areas. The acting was decent but something was missing from the movie.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|The HD is awsome on this game nice work on this one guys I am loving it on my S3
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie. I love movies based on real people and around events that actually happened.<br />Ben Affleck did a great job.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|What else need I say! The music from here was terrific. Clear, great and very inexpensive. It's a good buy
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|This is an outstanding movie. Matthew McConaughey givs a terrific performance in this fast-paced action / suspense thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. A must see!!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Lana's cover of Blue Velvet is worth the price of the entire album.  Her other songs are incredible in sound and feel and emotion and....she tells it like it is!

B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Love this series! It really keeps me on the edge of my seat, and there has never been a dull moment!
B000GWE44U|5.0|Most have seen The Shining a couple times over.  I have seen it much more, but more than a horror movie, it is completely amusing in so many ways.  Jack Nicholson is classic-he fits the role perfectly.  The dialog is entertaining, and the scenery wonderfully beautiful.  To be enjoyed regularly.  A great movie to have in your collection.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|Bought this on the recommendation of a friend who didn't tell me about the proselytizing that came with it.  Hard to strain out the story from the bible thumping, but brave he was and honored he should be.
0385474547|5.0|I wanted to take a trip down memory lane back to my high school days so I decided to buy this book.  I have not finished reading it yet but the first few chapters are a good reminder of how good this book is.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The title of this review says it all.  Without a file system manager/explorer, you can't find downloaded files &#34;behind the Amazon veil&#34;. This is the quickest and best way to access downloaded files to the Kindle Fire HD.  I recommend this app as a &#34;Must Have.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I learned a lot about myself by reading this. I'm also having my girlfriend read it so she can better understand me. Fantastic book!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|If Steinbeck were alive today, I wonder how it would go.  Unemployment, food stamps, saggers dealers, non-profits, and on and on versus the rest,  In some ways it is still the same.  One hell of a hell of a book.  A long read but worth every eye-opening word.  Will never forget it!!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|We really liked it. Good movie and keeps you interested without being brutal or vicious.  We watched it 2 times.

It has met all my expectations and I am so pleased to have my own copy to enjoy at any time.

Fairly priced and easily accessible through Amazon, Thanks again.
1484156005|5.0|What a marvelous and well-crafted story Christoph Fischer's Sebastian is. The story starts with a young sixteen-year-old boy, Sebastian, receiving an amputation to his leg for an infection, from a rusty nail, that went untreated, due to fear of doctors and needles. The reader is instantly drawn in to this protagonist and his mother, Vera, as well as the medical situation that lingers throughout the story that takes twists and turns along with the plots and subplots to help define a character that goes from being weak to growing an inner strength and beauty. Sebastian's story is the story of his family, the women who enter his life and the war that surrounds and defines them all.<br /><br />The scenes begin with Sebastian living in a dwelling that houses the grocery store his father Franz works in, that was owned by his father, Oscar, (also Sebastian's best friend). Also living with them is Oscar's wife Rebecca who is mostly bed ridden with a bad back, his mother Vera who has a weakened condition. Sebastian is in and out of the hospital with complications from problematic healing leg. Because of the strain on the family workload help is needed and enters a beautiful 18-year-old Ingeborg who becomes infatuated with Franz to complicate matters and ends up with her being replaced by Eva who Sebastian has a crush on as he begins to come into maturity and is sexual hormones awaken. Eva has her own secret that unfolds in a fascinating way opening to a new hire, Margit and her mother, Peroska. When Concurrent with Sebastian becoming involved with Margit his mother, Vera, connects up with friends who play key roles in throwing twists and turns into the story, which involve mystical aspects, s&eacute;ances and connecting with the afterlife. A revelation and slip of communication sends all their lives into chaos and the war in the backdrop takes center stage as the story moves along poignantly and engaging the reader with great depth.<br /><br />This is a time of great turmoil for people of Jewish faith, where divides are drawn with nations geography being molded and remolded, threatening to unsettle and disrupt millions of peoples. Sebastian's story is a metaphor for lives thrown into turmoil because of war and what war does to individuals separately and as citizens. It is a story of how the human condition and stresses become heightened and exaggerated when threatened by personal and geographic political evils. This is a story of great compassion and selfishness, of jealousy and love, of loss and risking, of having material and losing it all, of families and finding out what is important, of loyalty and betrayal. It is a story that runs deep in all of us, with emotions displaying what it is to be human. It is a story of every man and every woman with themes and messages that any reader can relate to, right down to the surprise and unexpected ending, which is how we do live our lives, after all is said and done.<br /><br />This intelligently and sensitively crafted story pulls the reader in, pulls at our heart strings, and keeps us glued to the page, long after the last one is closed, and the memory of Sebastian lingers, one that won't be easily or readily forgotten.

It is a story of every man and every woman with themes and messages that any reader can relate to, right down to the surprise and unexpected ending, which is how we do live our lives, after all is said and done.<br /><br />This intelligently and sensitively crafted story pulls the reader in, pulls at our heart strings, and keeps us glued to the page, long after the last one is closed, and the memory of Sebastian lingers, one that won't be easily or readily forgotten. I loved Sebastian.
B00CAJP0ZO|2.0|Not very good could if done way better. First song \\"hello\\" awful just awful. Like geekin lyrics could of been ten times better
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The storyline and characters kept your interest.  A nice read set in Ireland and the sad truth about some of the orphanages.
B000002H5I|5.0|This was the introduction I had to Ms. Chapman.  Purchased through Amazon for pricing and quick ship.<br />Still consider this the best Tracy Chapman I have heard to date. Purchased this to replace my cassette tape (yeah, a cassette tape)<br />Sound quality is excellent.  Wonderful variety of music.
0783235615|5.0|I'm one of Alfred Hitchcock's most devoted fans!! Rate this one high up there with all the rest!! Great buy.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Warning: It is a bloody movie.<br /><br />You should have known that because Quentin Tarantino made this movie, there was a definite chance of blood.<br /><br />This movie is (in my opinion) a great homage to the &#34;Spaghetti Western&#34; genre of movies that came out in the 1960's.<br /><br />Definitely on my &#34;To Rewatch&#34; list.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoying the different plots and twists in the story.  I can't wait for Season 4.  It's nice to watch something that isn't so violent that so many of the TV shows are.
B000002H97|5.0|Black album, if you want to call it that....just good Metallica, reasonable priced and easy to shop for on Amazon.<br />Review Metallica,  I wouldn't have a clue.<br />Good sound. Not problems
0783235666|5.0|No particular words can rate this Hitchcock movie except that it's a &#34;wonderful classic&#34;!! One of his best!! Great buy.
B0058O84G0|5.0|Love the first 2 books, just sorry the third one isn't written yet. I think I liked the first one best. Come on Ken!!!!!
B009MYARIK|5.0|True Sophie Kinsella style! Loved the book. The characters were well developed and interesting....had a feeling it would end like it did.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|You can tell the author experienced this book in his own life even though it is fiction. This must be how war feels.
B00BZOFUI2|2.0|I expected a lot from the new Deep Purple and was let down. I like Morse and Airey in the band and don't miss Blackmore at all. Jon Lord is perhaps a bigger loss to the band from a writing point. While the band themselves shares mixed feelings about their last few CD's as do the fans I find the last 4 better than this new one. Maybe it's the fact that you can't force yourself to accomplish what you did 40 years ago as writers? Maybe it's trying to write as \\"the band\\" did 40 years ago when only 3/5ths of that line-up remains? Morse is an amazing player and I think what they did with Perpendicular was stellar! It was the band as they were in that moment rather than trying to capture what they once sounded like.<br /><br />I believe Perfect Strangers, perhaps The Battle Rages On were far better representations of marrying their past and present then \\"Now What\\". All I hear different is Bob Ezrin really pimping Jon Lord's classic signature Hammond B3 sound channeled through Don Airey. Airey and Morse are, again, AMAZING musicians but I feel Ezrin became too focused on that Organ sound to the exclusion of Morse's guitar and the songs suffered. The classic sound came from the MIX, BLEND and SWAPPING OFF of the keys and guitar and here all we have are thick, B3 keys with Morse buried.<br /><br />The final nail for me is that they seem to be too mellow and melodic rather than powerful like songs such as Highway Star, Space Truckin', Burn that were just like a size 14 boot kicking you in the ass!
B00783NPVI|5.0|I love this dvd. So happy I made this purchase. Now I own a piece of the wedding. I am not sure why these don't come in blu ray?
0812993845|4.0|Rainy, cold afternoon? Check. Comfy couch, pot of tea? Check. Perfect time to settle in with the latest by Sophie Kinsella? Absolutely! And so with delicious anticipation I turned to the first page of Wedding Night.<br /><br />Lottie is 33 years old - she wants to get married and start a family. She's sure that her boyfriend Richard is the one. And she's sure he's going to pop the question - after all it's been three years.<br /><br />Her sister Fliss has already married and has a beautiful son. But not a beautiful marriage - she's in the midst of an acrimonious divorce.<br /><br />Well, Richard doesn't pop the question and Lottie runs headlong into the arms of her old flame Ben - and right up to the altar! Fliss is determined to keep Lottie from making what she sees as a terrible mistake. And Ben's friend and business colleague thinks the same. What ensues is a hilarious scheme to sabotage - you guessed it - their Wedding Night.<br /><br />Kinsella uses both sisters to narrate the book. It was great fun to have not one but two female leads. Their personalities are miles apart, but I found each character quite engaging. Yes, some of the situations are far fetched - but I'm not reading for reality - I'm reading for entertainment. And Wedding Night definitely kept me entertained. It was light and funny and I know I had a smile on my face much of the time.  (This would make such a great rom-com movie)<br /><br />Pick up a copy of Wedding Night for your beach bag this summer!<br /><br />For me, Sophie Kinsella is the Queen of Chick Lit.
B00006CXSS|5.0|VEEERRRRRRRRY GOOD MOVIE! good price on amazion than any store. Glad bought it! I would watch it all over again. Like the case, nice, sturdy... good covers.
B004N7977I|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid.  Still creeps me out after all these years.  Stands up well after 30+ years.  Highly recommended.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book, made for any zelda fan to enjoy the art and the explanations are equally amazing. Will never want to be rid of it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Not quite the ending I was expecting, but pretty good overall. Denzel did his thing and was good as usual.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|I used to remember to watch this movie on teveliosn, and I bought it, love it... it is really funny and good too. Good movie!
B005FUTC86|5.0|Great old movie and a great price($5) or so.  My daughter found it funny and entertaining. Quality was fine for HDTV.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I loved this app! Until I installed the most recent update. Now I keep getting error messages and &quot;force close&quot; even if I'm not using the app. I hope it gets fixed soon because I really enjoyed using it.
1250007305|1.0|Overly simplistic, too direct, and predictable.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book as I was excited by the reviews I had read. I love the Cuckoo's egg, Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground, CODE, and Ghost in the Wires. I was hoping it would be one more tech book I could add to my list of favorites I like to revisit from time to time. Unfortunately I could not get through it the first time. Everything about the the author's writing style seems too bland, even the sex scenes feel forced -- for the sake of just being included. They are awkward and embarrassing (it made me question whether or not the author has any real world experience getting laid).<br /><br />The story arch was ridiculous, details were used ad nauseum to support characters and back story in an apparent attempt to convince us the story was 'real'.<br /><br />However, take my review with a grain of salt. If you are not in the tech field, are still a virgin, and don't mind bad writing you may really enjoy this book.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|'Zero Dark Thirty', which is common military slang for, essentially, going operational when the rest of the world is sleeping is the rare film that neither glorifies nor indicts it's subject matter. Under the careful tutelage of Kathryn Bigelow ('The Hurt Locker') with a smart script by Mark Boal the solid cast recounts the hunt- and killing of- Public Enemy#1.<br /><br />Usama Bin Laden.<br /><br />Controversial from the onset, conservatives thought it would be a love letter to Obama (it isn't) and liberals decried the use of 'enhanced interrogation' (waterboarding, sleep deprivation, etc) that allowed a critical piece of information to be gleaned that helped crack the case. It doesn't glorify any of this; indeed presents it in a fairly straight and realistic manner.<br /><br />The interrogation sequence early on is a little darker than the actual way it is done, and the reliance on one character to propel the story ('Maya' played by the superb Jessica Chastain) when many were involved are a few quibbles. But overall, this is a riveting tale told beautifully.<br /><br />Forget the politics and just absorb the gripping narrative...
B003YL4LYI|3.0|For the end of the saga there were to many unresolved questions. I want another book to close the story.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Loved this movie! I have to admit this was a funny movie. There were a few teary moments though. Great movie!
0525423281|3.0|I loved Anna, of Anna and the French Kiss, also by this author--and Lola did not compare--but that is NOT the reason I am giving Perkins' second book only 3 stars. In fact, I gave Lola more of a chance than I normally would have given this book BECAUSE of Anna.  I would have stopped reading fairly early on except that I knew what Perkins was capable of; and she showed some of that in a very sweet, almost too sweet, ending.  Normally I would have stopped early because the beginning setup seemed quirky to me only for the sake of cuteness and not because it had a lot of life.  Even when Anna and St. Clair made their repeat appearances, they wouldn't have made much of an impression if I didn't already know them from book 1.  Then, as usual, I opened the book at random in several other sections.  Just by chance of course, and perhaps unfairly, I kept finding costume descriptions or descriptions of why Lola was in one place when she was supposed to be in another.  These samples of the story were not interesting for long.  Still, I kept reading, skipping to get to Cricket, too perfect Cricket.  His character gets my stars!  I'm really sorry to give Lola such a mediocre review, and I really hope Perkins' next book is better.  However, I have to say that I will take my time before requesting it.  I don't want to be as disappointed as I was with Lola.
1935707590|5.0|This book is very user-friendly and explains things in terms that are easy to understand.  It is almost so literal that you laugh because you think to yourself &#34;I knew that!&#34; It definitely helped me to focus on the areas that I was not as comfortable with and made it much easier to understand.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|The music is fabulous.  It's refreshing, creative and cutting edge.  I'll buy her music for as long as she makes it.  The only curious thing is that last night when I looked at this album, there were 13 songs listed, but today when I went to buy it there were only 12.  Most strange.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I liked the characters, narrative and history. Very nice read. Good love history, with some drama but a lot of love.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Totally enjoyed the book. Only complaint is that the flashbacks between past and present were sometimes confusing. Very  good plot.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app to have when you are in church or somewhere and don't have a bible on you.  Good read
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Just not a great story line / unbelievable / predicatable outcome/ depressing characters/ dragged out in the middle/ could not wait to finish
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Excellent suspense created around plausible events - I have enjoyed the edginess of Flynn's writing.  I have recommended her books to my friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you like psychological, edge of your seat novels then you will love this book!!!!  It's nonstop from start to finish!!  Just when you think you know what's going on you discover something else is happening.  Must read!!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Because it sounds nothing like their previous stuff, but after listening a few times, I really like it. It's a lot different but in a good way!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was so good, we watched it two days in a row.  Loved the comedy in it along with the great moving plot.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|During those times it was common that women married, and not of their choice .......This is about one who fights for independence, and is even more experience than the average male during those times...We all make bad choices in life...which she does, and later regrets deeply for what she has done....The results are a close relationship with her mother
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is better then the first I think. Everything is changing and it keeps you wanting more and more I could not put this book down.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Since I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, I feel a little awkward giving a review. The story starts off pretty interesting but turns very strange, very quickly. Its a bit of a rehash of Christine. I was left hanging out to dry with the ending as well. Just stopped...
0307887960|3.0|The book is very good if you are consistent with following what it says.  A diet, is a diet, is a diet.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The title got my attention as a book I must try. I wasn't disappointed. A great read. A few tears shed and smiles too.  Lovely story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazingly good even the second time! Off to finish the rest of the series...would definitely recommend this series to the ladies!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you are looking to read this, you've already read the first four.  So just get on with it!  And as usual, do not get too attached to characters.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Fascinating acting by everyone. Not without gore, but only as appropriate. Otherworldly. Doesn't give anything away and leaves the watcher with the same sense of mystery all the way through to the end.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My wife and I are addicted to this show.  We actually bought ShowTime to continue the series.  Definitely worth checking this program out.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie caused me to take a look at historical accounts of the days just prior to the civil war in the US.  If anything, the slaves' plight was worse than depicted in the film. I was enlightened and entertained. I saw it three times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I highly recommended this APP for everyone who love s horses or anyone who wants it. It's also the best game I've ever played.
1402270275|5.0|Kiss of Steel takes place in the dark streets and mysterious fogs of London, where the poor are ruled by the blue-blood royals (humans infected with the vampire virus) and pay their taxes with pints of blood.<br /><br />Honoria Todd is doing her best to keep her secrets and her little family together, but as hard as she tries to, she knows that her time is limited and that eventually her secrets will be discovered, and the enemy who hunts her will find her.<br /><br />Honoria is not a 'damsel in distress' by choice-she is strong, smart and very capable-but is without her former social status, money and the proper care for her brother. A local master, Blade, sends one of his people knocking on her door to bring her in for questioning, she has no choice but to go and hope that things work out.<br /><br />Blade, at first sight, looks brutal and there is no doubt as to why he is so feared. But Honoria does something to him that he has never felt in his whole existence. And he is determined to not only find out why, but wants to protect her... and, in his words, \\"make her mine.\\"<br /><br />Every scene between these two was mesmerizing and entertaining, the banter was comical at times, and the attraction was steamy and written tastefully - definitely an adult read!<br /><br />In my humble but accurate opinion,<br /><br />Karen \\"Kitty\\" Stone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever. The game is realistic and fun. I love horses and this is a great way to spend time with them when I'm not and the barn
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read one chapter and quit.  In all the hundreds of books I have read in my lifetime, I have never quit like this.  I hated the writing style and could not figure out where he was leading.  After the one chapter, I scanned through the second one and read the chapter titles and found that this book was going to be boring. I should have given it more time but with all the wonderful digital books available, why bother trying to read a book that I would find boring.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Classic Skynyrd, did not see them,but this is the next best thing.I loved the out takes that were not on the original.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The quality of the movie was great. I had no issues viewing it. The movie was great also. Loved the hulk.
B00683JLXA|5.0|Very challenging...cute sounds.  Addicting and amazing how the time just slips by...I wish I had more bullets, BUT, I'm getting better.  YeeHaa!!!  I just love it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I really love this movie. Highly recommend it! The plot actually builds up just like the book! Go watch it!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The plot is good but not great. I was hoping for something as good as the Lion's Game. This story about the panther was pretty good, some of the characters were interesting, the setting was excellent, but the story line was a too predictable in too many places. That having been said I look forward to the next John Corey story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This horse game is really,really,really awesome!I would recommend it to all of my friends and anyone who has ever wanted a horse!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love this series!!! I have always been a fan of fantasy and have not been disappointed with these at all!!
B008602KQI|2.0|Series of random events surround an interesting central idea.  I guess it's a kids movie and so content, direction, and performances are irrelevant.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This writer writes well and the plot is interesting with lots of twists and turns right up until the very end of the story.
B00985E3UG|4.0|It repeats itself quite a lot, and sometimes can be a bit too descriptive of non-core issues. Overall a very thoughtful book, which will change the way you see your supermarket isles.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app.  I have super hard days at work and like to relax to music or noise that is calming.  Gone are the meds!
B0086213XW|5.0|This movie really allows Michelle, Seth, and Sarah to shine. I never really cared for Michelle Williams, but she was fantastic in this. Her Canadian accent is right on or at least identical to my Canadian friends who live here in the States. It's difficult to describe why I liked her performance, other than I loved and hated her character--which means she played it perfectly. The movie is easy to dismiss as a cheater film, but because all of the characters are emotionally mature, it is impossible to categorize it as such. Seth is excellent as Lou. I really hope he continues to branch out into serious roles. He's adorably human in this. His comedic timing really translates to excellent delivery in the dramatic scenes. But if we're talking biggest leap, it has to be Sarah Silverman. Sure the pool scene was horribly edited. But Sarah's deadpan delivery really works here, she has a magic that steals scenes. And she nailed the monologue. I'm sorry this film has not been recognized for the gem it is. Intimate couples' language and silence shines in this movie. And questions about longevity of relationships and passion and what is ultimately important to you are asked of the viewer in everyday language and events you cant help but relate to.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I think I have been waiting on this solo album since 2005, and it was worth the wait. Have always been a big Cinderella fan, when they would tour I would travel to myrtle every summer  catch them then next day or two catch them back in Atlanta. Tom is one of the best live front men out there. If you are a Cinderella fan then of course you don't need a review just buy it. But if you are on the fence, this guy is one of the best song writers out there and one hell of a musician and its worth checking out, and I highly recommend you check him out live, either solo or with Cinderella you wont be disappointed.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Movie felt like it would never end with its rambling plot line. Also seemed like script was trying too hard to be funny so even scenes that could have been humorous were just kind of uncomfortable. Neither the funny or witty flix I expected from this group.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Very good action movie but it appeared the director used quite a bit of creative license in its production did not depict events as layer reported by participants
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|The controls are ridiculous.  Do not waste your time on this download.  Interface needs a lot of work to make it worthwhile.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Great book! Easy to read and leaves us all grateful for what we have today. It gives quiet a glimpse of the struggles many families endured years ago but shows how mothers kept their families together despite the odds. Can't wait to finish it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book. I think it's even better than the first one! Moving onto the third and I cannot wait! :)
8478885196|5.0|I loved it very much thank you for this book my family and I will have a few adventures reading this.  And the shipping was very fast.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I never had a full understanding of Les Mis until I watched this movie version. I can listen and do listen to this  soundtrack daily especially at bedtime or on my long commute to or from work on 95. The talent surpasses all.  The fact this movie soundtrack was filmed live verses precorded astounds me.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Beautifully written, heartbreaking story. The accounts of child abuse are desperately hard to read, but a necessary part of the story.
B00BJS7104|5.0|If you are one of those people who describes Django Unchained as  'blood all over the place' or 'over-the-top violent' then you really didn't 'see' the movie. Do yourself a favor and watch it again and really listen to what is said and how it is said. Put yourself in that time and place and FEEL that movie happening around you. If you can't appreciate how Waltz, Jackson, DiCaprio, Washington and Foxx and even Don Johnson and Bruce Dern make the ugly world of slavery come alive, then you are missing a masterpiece.
8478884955|5.0|I loved it very much thank you for this book my family and I will have a few adventures reading this. And the shipping was very fast.
B000SEI230|3.0|I didn't really know what to expect from the short description provided by Amazon. I have read several other books by Nicholas Sparks and this one is not my favorite. I like the newer ones better. That being said, it was still well written and worth the sale price I paid for it on Kindle.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Thus application has so many ideas but I have a hard time navigating it and figuring out how to use it in the best way to benefit me. So many GREAT ideas on that site!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Such a great show, hard to get over why they cancelled. Might have been because I didn't watch all of it when it was on the air! Loving going through all of them now, though. Joss Whedon, despite his harshness to his characters, is the boss.
1600243916|5.0|This is a must read book and should be added to anyone's Library. This order was for the CD virsion, it was great to be able to listen to it while I was driving to work (fairly long drive time). I like talk radio but this was benifical time spent. I ended up buy the book to read as well and to put on my shelf for future reference.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|Watched this with our 4-year-old, it was a bit violent for her. She didn't seem to care for it either. Overall it had a good message, accept yourself as you are, but a lot of guns!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so fun I can play it 4 hours! other games you can beat it in a couple of days but this game is going 2 take me years to beat. it is so much fun that I even convinced my dad 2 play it and he loved it!
034580404X|5.0|My goodness! I have only read the first one, but James manages to find new words to describe love and sex scenes.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've always enjoyed Tina Fey. I think she's an incredibly intelligent funny woman. This book is told in such a way that it feels like you're having a conversation. Everything from the side stories to the asterisks at the end, this book is wonderful. I could barely put it down in between sleep and eating (which means that I took it with me to the potty.) Thank you Mrs. Fey.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is a great movie and with number 3 coming out I wanted to rewatch the first two to &#34;refresh&#34; myself on the series. I tried Netflix, Hulu and Epix and none of the had both available for streaming at what I consider a reasonable price. I am an Amazon Instant Video convert!
B00B9E29CI|5.0|Paul has done a great job of shining light on the hidden factors of success.  In an overly Cartesian world we tend to focus on educational content and test performance.  How Children Succeed explores the foundations of education - specifically those of self knowledge, emotion regulation, willpower and curiosity.  Understanding the critical role of family dynamics and early community influences helps us focus on where and how we can remedy some of the failures of education.  Given the current levels of youth unemployment this is an essential question for parents, educators, employers and politicians.<br /><br />Paul's work complements that of Tim Wilson (Redirect), Roy Baumeister (Willpower) and Richard Davidson (Emotional Styles of your Brain) in bringing to light the power of working deeper than the simple, seductive idea of IQ or &#34;smart&#34;.  We are steadily crafting a working approach to cultivating fully developed young people. The evidence is compelling and the interventions are becoming much more practical.  How Children succeeds will be an inspiring and practical guide for those interested in helping our young people succeed in life and work.
B000MRA5EM|5.0|This DVD is different, it's one of those movies once you start watching you want to see more and more! It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is really good!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|The book kept my keen interest for majority of the story. I found I lost some interest the last quarter of the book.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Not a great movie, but both my sons thought it was fun.  Even they thought it was long near the end.  But, who doesn't like watching cars turn into robots and blow stuff up, right?
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great acting, beautiful cinematography, filmed in Ireland with lots of handsome Celtic men. As good as Game of Thrones, and Justified. This is how all the Viking series and movies should have been done but never were. I really can't say enough good about this series and my husband loves it too.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|My younger daughter, just loves all these new songs, that Justin sings! The CD came on time and was in perfect condition! If you're a Justin Timberlake fan, you must get this CD!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The HBO series is very close to the book, I like.  It was good they kept the creative freedom closely related.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Excellent but addictive  amazing game I enjoyed this game very much I would tell anyone and everyone to try this game
B00A8ECU24|3.0|fun but annoying they make you pay big money for gems. This is a fun game even for adults but it's pretty annoying that a lot of things cost gems and gems cost real money.
0141024038|5.0|This is my younger daughter's favorite book, and I was happy to find it for her! Got it for a great price, and it came in perfect condition! This book is a must read!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow, turn of event.  Ended with an oh, s***. Can't wait for the next book what is Josh up to?
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|AWESOME game that everybody should try, it is WAYYYYYYYY better than the original Leps world. I enjoy the game very much, although the original I  not that good.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This is a good action film and carries the Daniel Craig Bond well.  It added some nice character development to Bond - who's always been a bit of a cipher.  M got a little too dark for my taste, but still an enjoyable movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Five stars because the book is real and it connects with kids who are in high school with friends who may be older.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|The recipient -- a major Groban fan -- loves it.<br /><br />The latest from this artist, and a must-have for the Josh Gro-Fan.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I have been watching this series on my Kindle Fire w/Prime package for free . Awesome series , falls in line and gives more little details to this time frame with movies like the boyena Sisters , and other movies along this line . But the series really gets into the little details into a mad kings quest for love , a boy Eir, and how the the churchs involvement played a major role in some of the everyday doings that take place in this time frame , both good and bad. I would recommend this series to anyone who like time period dramas , that also get alittle steamy .
086571701X|5.0|Just started reading the book last week and I can't put it down. I am new to Aquaponics and wanted to get started asap. I think that the author does a great job explaining the basics to those who are just learning about the world of Aquaponics. I had to skip past the first section of the book where Bernstein talks about why we need Aquaponics and how awsome it is etc etc just because that is not why i got this book for. I wanted to learn how to get started and Bernstein does a wonderful job at that. Get this book, unless you are advanced, then get a school textbook.
B0088X7YMS|2.0|The fact it was an animated movie (i.e. a cartoon)? That was a wee disappointing.<br />But, overall, it was a good addition to our video collection.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, much to my surprise.  It deviated some from the book but that's to be expected.  Overall, it told the story well and was worth watching.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best seasons of the show although S5 may definitely eclipse it - have to re-watch to give my final verdict. First ep of this season is brilliant and the rest of the season is pretty amazing. The performances by Stana Katic and Nathan Fillion, and their incredible chemistry really make this very worthwhile, but the cast of supporting characters in the show are just as amazingly talented and contribute to making this one of the best crime dramas that has a little of everything mixed in, and is decidedly not formulaic. Andrew W. Marlowe and company know a thing or two about how to create a hit and keep it relevant. When you see the end of S3, you will of course immediately need to see S4. Having rewatched all seasons (except the current one) in their entirety several times, I have to admit, the episodes never get old or stale. They are always entertaining.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I could relate to this story. It also brings in a lot of humor. There is a serious note to some parts that makes the story better.  However, sometimes I found the historical parts a little boring but I think I was just eager to get back to her story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You want the best game ever then download this game... you will never put down your device!!!!  :)  ;)<br /><br />Since I have had it I have beaten people's scores and gotten new people to be and lastly I have updated this games for new places to play at. So if you are a American you have to get this game NOW!!!!!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|.this series is full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what is going on, some other shocking thing comes along.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I am in awe of Diana Krall's talent, both as a vocalist and as a musician, and I think many of her recordings don't do justice to the range and depth of her abilities as an artist. Seeing her live a couple of years ago was a great experience. Glad Rag Doll is a big disappointment, both as a recording and in live performance. It's an interesting concept - and I appreciate the desire to do something different - but this hasn't been a successful experiment in either choice of material or its rendition.
B00BZOFUI2|4.0|I saw some people were dissappointed in this album. Maybe that can be if your expectations are too high, or too much pointed in a particular direction, I don't know. I heard Now What?! and it immediately sounded very good to me. And after listening to it again and again it has grown to be one of my favorite Purple albums. In the press there is said that DP went back to the same way of working as they did in the seventies. That just refers to the way the songs were composed, so do not, really do not, expect their sound to be like it was back then. This is Deep Purple of 2013 and it is very different from Deep Purple in 1972 or so. But it is cerainly not less!!! Their sound is less loud and rough (although there is some good old-school hardrocking on this album!) but still very unmistakably Deep Purple, dynamic; brilliant and with a lot of variation; more and (to my opinion) better than the old days. Now What has the same freshness and sparkling fun in making music that Purpendicular has; you can hear them enjoying making it. During the recording of this album the band heard of Jon Lord's passing and you can feel Jon throughout the whole album, which is dedicated to this brilliant keyboardplayer. One song in particular is about him: 'Above and Beyond' and it is the first DP song ever to bring tears to my eyes. Now What ?! has quickly conquerred a special place amongst my favorite Purple albums, next to Machine Head; Perfect Strangers and Purpendicular.
0385340540|1.0|After 700 reviews this one may well go unread but I have to vent.<br />The plot is horrible--completely inane. At least 20% of the book is describing people drinking coffee and having meals in Italy. The historical tidbits are shallow and tedious.<br />What Grisam should have done is use the premise to the book and rewrite a thriller once he saw that this was pure drivel.
B007V65R54|3.0|This book is intended to show a big picture on prediction. But, for those users looking for a more deep bibliography, this one is very superficial and doesn't offer a great opportunity to expand their knowledge about this theme.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|The film conveys a sense of reality and an admirable attention to detail that makes it well worth viewing.  The torture scenes were ingenuous.  Shouting at captives suggests the questioner lacks other resources.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|After reading the reviews on this Album I took a chance and was very happy.I love the duet with Elton John.Some unique songs you normally would not hear on the radio but if you are a fan its a must album with alot of songs on the 2 cds.
B0001I561E|5.0|The Aladdin DVD was in excellent condition and I couldn't wait to add it to my Disney collection!  Perfect order!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading every word of this book. The characters in it are great and , of course quirky. The book just tumbles along and Graeme Simison is insightful a nd sensitive to Don's character and I have enjoyed being inside his mind and how he processes life's situations.Loved it!
B0085X31VE|5.0|I have been a long time music enthusiast but up until this point I had never heard anything quite this powerful. It was almost as if I was born to hear this music, the impact was immediate. The music itself is what I would describe as progressive black metal with a violin. None of the songs mush together, each is an entity of its own. I'm not great at reviewing, but this is by far one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever come to possess and I will be cherishing this for years to come.
B0013TTLDE|1.0|This book comes across as one trying to cash in on the Downton Abbey genre. The author should have bothered to do some research, so many scenes are the 21st century superimposed over the early 20th century. I can't believe the author believes that calling one's father &#34;Pa&#34; was ever acceptable in England during the era in which this novel supposedly took place!<br /><br />The timing doesn't add up either. The author should try drawing a timeline. The timeline for all the events occurring in this book could not have occurred in a single person's lifetime!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very interesting. Makes you think outside the box. Please design some more rooms! Can't wait for the next edition, please hurry.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Beautiful movie and a wonderful story.  The &#34;behind the scenes&#34; extra were phenomenal. I love this director. Great imagination.<br />It leaves you wondering which is real.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I LIKED THE GAME BUT TOO MUCH BACK AND FORTH. I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE STORYLINE.  It never explained who all the people were.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|funny, current, relatable in that it covers the trials of marriage as you age, but with humor and really encourages that one certainly should be able to laugh at oneself.
B00CDFWJIG|2.0|IF \\"Twilight\\" can do it, then why couldnt you? This movie was just awful! Ive read ALL the books, and I hope you get another Director that has actually read the books to direct the next movie!!! HOW in the world are you going to merge the rest of the books together......After this disappointment I doubt you will be able to and the readers will be heartbroken! I understand things have to be left out or even changed a little BUT this was HORRIBLE!!!! :( I now own this movie but probably will NOT watch it again.<br />I beg of you Kami Garci and Margaret Stohl....PLEASE do not let another Director slice and dice your WONDERFUL creation!!!!!
B009AMANH4|1.0|The Blue Ray disc would not play and I have never had any problems before.  I have a Playstation 3 and it has never had a problem like this before.<br /><br />The movie itself was awe inspiring.  Had do use the other disc to watch it.

B008XBCJ34|1.0|I bought this product from amazon. Request that resend it to the manufacturer, but I am in South America.<br />Thanhs.
0765325950|5.0|There are 14 books in this series, so you better be ready for some serious reading. It keeps me captivated.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I guess I got lucky and picked this up right before it went out of \\"print\\" as it's been sold to a big publishing house.  I understand why.  This is an excellent bit of Sci Fi.  Totally plausible, hilariously funny, well thought out and just down right fun read.<br /><br />I've not even finished the book yet and I can tell you unequivocally I love it.  LOVE IT.  Just stop reading and buy it.  Almost a thousand 5 star reviews can't be wrong.  (well they could, given that this is Amazon, but not this time!)
B0091REZMW|4.0|just started playing and I like it!!! clue and picture finds are my favorite!! I play right before bedtime after baby is asleep!
B003L77G8I|5.0|The show has great characters and plot lines.  Its characters have matured and into a team.  One for all and all for one. Still surprises.
B008645YH6|5.0|This CD is just amazing I received it brand new untouched! And I enjoyed every minute if it! Five stars
B005NK69ZC|4.0|i actually bought this by mistake, pressed the wrong button on my kindle, but i am so glad i did. I had a permanent smile on my face for the whole read! Great read, now to buy the other book!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I was really expecting this book to be much funnier than it was.  Maybe my idea of humor differs from most people.<br /><br />This was neither a good memoir nor a good laugh.  The stories recalled were scattered, shallow, and dull.  The attempts at humor came across as...trying to hard?  You know that person at a party who gets *almost* drunk but overacts as EXTREMELY plowed?  They're obnoxious, attention-starved, and make everyone else feel awkward?  You know the type?  That's this book.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|When I rented this, I planned to watch it while falling asleep. I was pleasantly surprised by the characters and story lines. Some characters weren't believable (the super-nerdy dad in the dad's group and the ultra-buff guy they idolize), but they were all likable. I found myself both laughing and crying...and staying awake until it was over.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|This is a total waste of money.  I was hopeful that it would work but it is such inferior quality that it is useless.  I have to hold the cassette in place to get both channels to play.  Very disappointing.  I would have it replaced but looking at the quality, I must believe that they are all like this.  Don't buy.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Things are missing like what are you supposed to do with the money you earn.<br />I finished the game in a day or two and now I'm on the edge of buying the expansion but will it be worth it?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This review was written by my 8 year old grandson Bo.<br />I am eight years old and my grandparents make me read when I get home from school. This book was super funny! I kept reading more than my required time because this book was so interesting & funny! My grandma is going to order me another wimpy kid book!
B009DZDJU6|4.0|Reluctant to watch this as I enjoy fact not fiction when it comes to important American figures but was surprised by this movie. Enjoyed every minute of it and would recommend to my friends to watch and judge for themselves

I say buy it (used) or copy it from a friend (thier rich L.Z that is).<br /><br />  Joe Frogg!!!
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|the quality of the movie was great, but it did not keep my attention, not what i expected it to be.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The story was easy to get into and the characters and situations were believable.  I liked the different characters taking their turns telling the story as it progressed.
B000002KGT|5.0|i have been a fleetwood mac fan since 1975 when i was only 9 years old and heard Rhiannon on the radio. Then i saw them on the midnight special and fell in love all over again. Especially Stevie nicks. She was so beautiful! And a very unique voice. I had good taste in music even then. Heh heh! When Rumours exploded on the airwaves i was floored! What a sound! What a magnificent piece of musical artistry and pure genious compilations! Every song is excellent! My favorite is Go your own way. I dont want to know should have been a single. The tight harmonies and melody is pure listening enjoyment. Oh daddy is very somber kinda dark omnious and foreboding pleasure. Christine mcvie at her best. Very underrated song! Im a part time dj at a local radio station and on monday night at 9;20 sharp i do my obscure rare \\"RICKY\\" track of the night. And my dog MAC whos named after my faves f Fleetwood mac has his mac track played. Lol. THE MAC TRACK IS ALWAYS A RARELY HEARD FLEETWOOD MAC TRACK. LISTEN! 88.7 THE CHOICE!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Sooooo happy these guys are back... missed them terribly!<br />This album is very different form their previous ones, and that'a a beautiful thing! Progression and change is always good. It's an approach we definitely had not heard from FOB, yet somehow you can still hear that signature FOB in there. I can also hear a hint of 80's pop in there... A pinch, let's say. Enjoyed it from begging to end. Specially liked The Phoenix and Rat A Tat- the collaboration with Courtney Love, who gives the album a great touch.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read this book for my book club. I found it painful to read. The author did a good job of describing the heartbreak and courage of a young girl kidnapped and held captive. She was a creative and caring mother to the little boy born to her while in captivity. She was also brave and daring as she planned their escape. Though freedom was scary both the mother and son handled it with the love and care they'd had for each other during their five years together in the Room.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It's a jam packed pocket book there there is a lot of  adventure in the book.was  amazing and a paper airplane  nd
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Hard to put down,this was a cliff hanger from the beginning. The characters were as in real life. Well written and gripping.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Netflix had season one so at a friends urging I watched. Mistake! I was hooked! The characters are very well developed and the story line may jump over time but it totally works. Downton is filled with fine actors and keeps the show very PG so it doesn't matter who you are watching it with in the room unlike most HBO and Showtime.
0061950726|4.0|I am not a fiction reader, but this book intrigued me. I wouldn't call it gripping, but it had very believable characters. Her characterization of a \\"goth\\" teen was insightful and realistic; the other main character, Vivian, was engaging and quite believable as well. The author manages to weave the present and the past together, all the while introducing the reader to the historical reality of the orphan trains. I wouldn't call this \\"must read\\" fiction, but it is an engaging, relaxing read that I will recommend to others.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Easy to use, able to remove and reuse with ease. Perfect for decorating my girls room, but easily changed and removed as they out grow it.
B0090SI460|5.0|One of my favorite Pixar/Disney movies of all time. The blu-ray version is stunning compared to the DVD version. I actually upgraded to blu-ray  and sold my DVD version just so I could watch it again in Hi-Def.
0441013597|5.0|Dune by Frank Herbert is considered by many to be one of the greatest science fiction series in existence today. I admit that it took me two tries to finish this book. During the first, I found the book to be extremely slow and while it did capture my interest, I didn't have the inner desire to see it through for some odd reason. I decided to revisit Dune a couple months later and really try to take my time with it. There must be a reason why this book and series is so famous among science fiction fans! Suffice it to say, I have managed to complete the book and can say that it was a blast to read through. However, the book requires a lot of patience and the reader must be able to really use their imagination because trust me, that is the only way you'll get the most out of this book. And even if you are able to do just that, there will still be parts where you'll just do a double-take. It's awesome in its own way although it can be a bit frustrating to readers who are not hardcore science fiction readers such as myself.<br /><br />Dune is about betrayal, loyalties, politics and survival on a planet that is covered in nothing but sand. Naturally, water is one of the most precious commodity and whoever holds water also holds wealth. Not surprisingly, a strange spice called melange which can only be harvested in the desert areas on the planet of Arrakis, also provides a ton of wealth to whomever controls it. It is here we enter in the lives of the Atreides family. We follow young Paul and his family as they move from their home planet of Caladan to the desert planet of Arrakis where Paul will become a legend over time among the Fremen people.<br /><br />I feel that Dune obviously is a very good science fiction book. However, there were just some parts during the middle of the story that took way to long to develop with not much interesting things happening. The best parts of the book were during the encounters with the sand worms in the desert. These massive guardians of the desert makes farming for melange that much more difficult but necessary nonetheless. The Fremen people of the desert, which you'll read much about, also holds a mysterious aura that makes them very unique and fun to read at times. Their hardened lifestyle is meant for survival in the harsh desert lands of Arrakis and is very much different from what Paul is use to.<br /><br />There are also a lot of technology being infused into the Dune world such as flying 'thopters', cruiser ships, laser beam weapons, laser shields, rocket launchers and of course, stillsuits. However, don't expect Dune to be a book heavy on action. It is definitely anything but that. Everything is slow going but most novels of this magnitude is often like this. Characters for the most part are fleshed out enough to give you a sense of their worth and personality. I did wish the author spent just a tad bit more time on developing other characters. The Baron, Reyd, the Sardaukar's, Count Fenring and the likes are all very interesting but not much time was spent fleshing them out. Luckily, the story itself isn't spoiled by this so no harm is done.<br /><br />Dune obviously is a fantastic read. The movies and TV shows that spawned from this series is a testament of this. Whenever I think of what a science fiction novel should be like, Dune comes into mind because it has a bit of everything ranging from strange planets, strange people inhabiting them, space travel, different ruling factions and family houses that secretly scheme for more power, assassins, weird species of animals and of course, special technology that are light years ahead of what we currently have in the present. Reading Dune can be exhausting at times but I'm glad I stuck with it.of the desert makes farming for melange that much more difficult but necessary nonetheless.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I grew up with video games in the 80's so this movie was great in my eyes.  My 6 year old also loved it but he wished other known characters (particularly Bowser) had a larger role.  I didn't mind as the original story is great enough to carry the torch.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Just love this CD.  Bought it for the first two songs but love the whole album! I Love Blake Shelton!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie!  I can see why it won an Academy Award.  True incident is well covered in this DVD.  Wow!

B00005QGAZ|4.0|This is a great C.D., but has a lot less of the songs I was looking for on it; I should have read the song-list before purchase.  However, it's Michael Jackson, and if one is a fan, I can only recommend it!
0307888908|4.0|How can you take all of the ambition, hard work, and courageous risk taking personality of the Silicon Valley start-up culture and apply it to your own life and career? That's what Reid Hoffam, cofounder and chairman of Linkedin and Ben Casnocha aim to offer with \\"The Start-Up of You\\".<br /><br />Boldly positioning the Linked In brand on the cover page threw me off at first. I like Linkedin as a site, but I didn't want to read a whole book subtly advertising it. Surprisingly the cover was a false lead, The Start-up of you is a unique career development book that actually provides a well-crafted plan of attack for improving your career path. In addition to the 7  chapters devoted to teaching you how to turn yourself into a start-up, it offers a page at the end of each with homework to get you actually moving along on your path instead of just reading about it. It's a great little reference book I plan on keeping on my shelf to refer back to throughout the years.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|if you in the mood for a cool action flick with some old school tossed in and want to laugh, this is me movie for you. My only regret is I didn't see it in theater.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is a pro and interweaving various story and plot line and making us love a character (Robie) who is less than pristine. He portrays a human with an achilles heel and a heart in the right place.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl walked you step by step through her current experiences and her reflections.  Though I couldn't relate to her devastating loss of her mother, it's easy to transfer her emotions to a person of importance to you who you have lost.<br />I may be biased since I've hiked in MT and know the challenges and that was only on day trips!<br />She is particularly accurate when she writes about the juxtaposition  between thinking about sex and then viewing the current condition of her body.<br />Angst and Humor!  Very rewarding read.<br />Diana
B00002SSKI|5.0|This is a movie I loved when I was a little kid, and I couldn't beat the price when I found this DVD on Amazon. Not only did I pay just $5 for this classic, but I also received in LESS THAN 24 HOURS after I purchased it!!! There is no reason to buy a product anywhere else if you can buy it on Amazon. Their customer service cannot be beat.<br /><br />For those looking for a nostalgic movie with a cute storyline, this is for you. The soundtrack is full of good oldies, and the movie is set in a neighborhood everyone wants to grow up in. It focuses on the power of friendship and the ability to go home even after years and years have passed.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|Love it works great and is light and very strong. Makes a good tool to defend your self with you can't go wrong with this.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|What else is there to say?  The saga continues with more bizarre circumstances and characters.  Keeps me guessing most of the time... Very entertaining, yet causes me to excercise my brain trying to figure out who (or what) &#34;done it&#34;.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very cute. The kids love it. Nemo is one of their all-time favorites.<br />They love building the reef and seeing some of the movie characters like Nemo, Marlin and Dory.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Usually I can spot the criminal in short order in movies, but this one had me twisting and turning.  It was a great movie.  It does have strong language and content so it isn't recommended for children, of course.  It kept my interest throughout.  It is not a movie you want to walk away from to get snacks or take a potty break without pressing pause or you will be lost.  It needs your full attention, but has no problem getting it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is.great like awesome! It is just like the real game, and its great for scribblenauts fans out there!
B0060QM0AG|5.0|My favorite book of all time-I've read all of the James Herriot books, but this one is closest to my heart!

B008B1VYP0|5.0|I absolutely love this album! Yeah, Maroon 5 went pop, but personally I think it was a good choice to branch out and try a different genre.<br />I will admit long before buying this album it took me a little longer to adjust to their new style, but like I said: I love it! Awesome album!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I'd love it more if it were able to get my current game installed on my kindle onto my iPad . Don't like having to start over
B004LWZW42|3.0|Buy this dvd if you are a collector.  Dont bother if you arent.  It's predictable and seriously lacking in character development, which really is the whole point of prequels, isn't it?
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|It came right on Time the day it was supposed to. Amazing stuff came in it and it was an awesome CD from Tyler. I just loved it
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Didn't see the movie when it came out originally. Wanted to &#34;catch up&#34; with the series in preparation for Iron Man 3. Loved Robert Downey Jr. since the 80's! This movie does not disappoint! Excellent entertainment.
B005K17RU0|4.0|A good program.  However, I still find that I use the Weather Channel app on my Ipod more than this one.
B003KK65KG|5.0|This book really gets you thinking about everything that is wrong with the world! And as a senior I think I'm reasonably qualified to have an opinion; and as a Mum to three 40yr old adults!! All I can say it well done Jodi for showing us the reason why some world countries are subject to the matter dealt with in the book and deal with it in extraordinary ways that ends in mass carnage. Bullying, PTSD, guilty until proven innocent, negative human behaviour, and a scarcity of positive human behaviour. Terrific page turning story, thanks Jodi.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very similar to the app I have on my Ipod.  Seems to work well, but I have not used it a great deal.
B004AO1FF6|4.0|I have enjoyed watching Doctor Who since it restarted. The show characters, even with the main character changing, have been great.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a very good program and one I've already used numerous times.  I particularly like the fact that the display is large and it keeps track of every keystroke you enter so you can check for accuracy.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud! Loved hearing all her stories. Great light reading. I reccomend this book for anyone who knows Tina Fey.  They will love this book!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I bought this movie and it came fairly quickly. And of course I already had seen the movie and loved it, so I'm glad it is not part of my movie collection!
B00846REIS|2.0|The author tried so hard to re-create Fifty shades I couldn't get past it.  What writer uses cliche lines like &#34;I know, right&#34;, a term my 17 year old used four years ago!  I was shocked to see the authors bio, it didn't seem to match the lazy and poor writing style of this series.  So Disappointed!!
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Good movie... Lots of eye opening facts about our food you may or may not want to know about! If you liked the movie, be sure to check out Fast Food Nation... It digs a lot deeper into the issues discussed in the movie.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Really glad I bought a blu-ray.  Excellent film that protrayed our past President that was only in our thoughts.  Thanks.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.  I haven't read the book because I found the premise disturbing but it was done much differently than I anticipated and was a very thought provoking movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love his books and this is another great one to read. Just can't get enough of his books happy happy
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Other than some of the tasks need how to, it's a great game!  Kind of really makes me miss having horses. :(
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It works most of the time, but i wish it read a broader selection of codecs. I'm only writing this sentence because this dopey diagnostic came up that said I needed 4 more words...
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I love the movies and was extremely happy with the movies, It had a cool little booklet in it too.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I must say that I was greatly anticipating this item. I have always been interested in the mono mixes but never saw the need. After receiving this item I dont believe I have listened to the stereo mixes! I must say the new stereo mixes are louder and have a more modern sound. But....the mono mixes are so good I just cant return to the fake stereo. That being said...the mono mixes do have their drawbacks. The most obvious is a slight distortion in the mix. Not sure if it is from the remastering or on the original recording. But it is there. Keep in mind that this merely makes the Beatles sound more aggressive. Odd. Although mono mixes..they sound more like modern recordings than \\"ancient\\" mono tapes.  Again....since my purchase of these cds about 2 months ago I have not touched the stereo cds. This cd collection is a must for anyone who is a die hard Beatles fan.

B004GYNPL2|2.0|Storing usernames and passwords on this app is easy, and I have learned to depend on it for a very long list of usernames and passwords.  The glitch comes when it is time to replace your current android phone.  This app does not easily sync with your computer, Dropbox, or any other alternative.  Beware, if you come to depend on this app, you will be very frustrated when you try to preserve your data as you move to a new android.  For the past 24 hours, I have gotten nothing from mSecure technical support other than a promise they will help me when they get around to it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought this for my 10year old daughter so she wouldn't break her phone! I don't know how many times she's dropped it, but thanks to life proof case phone is fine!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|What a fascinating and unusual setting for a policier. But Tim Rob Smith carries it off with gusto and élan. A really good read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It took you to the depths of an awful, frightening, and sad childhood to a spot or two of uproarious laughter. It was an easy read, well written, and very Irish.  The outcome was surprising.  I would definitely recommend this book especially if you have an Irish heritage, been to Ireland, or plan on going.
0307352153|4.0|I was led to this book by a column by Leonard Pitts, Jr.  He said he was an introvert and praised the book.  I found the book interesting as well.  I've long known I am introvert and learned early it was not the preferred personality type in this competitive society.  My father, a salesman, encouraged me to be more outgoing.  I was never comfortable with the idea and finally and wisely came to the decision to ignore him (and others) on the topic.  Trying to be extraverted never worked and made me miserable.<br /><br />However I also learned that if you are quiet there are some personalities who think they can easily push you around.  I learned to confront them early on.  In one instance a manager confronted me in the middle of a crowded office on an issue that was more personal than job related.  When I quietly disagreed with him he raised his voice so I raised mine. This escalated to a shouting match which did not make either one of us look particularly good.  But in the long run I found I got a lot more respect. However I found the best way to gain respect was to know what I was talking about<br /><br />This book can be helpful to parents of children who are introverted.  It can provide insights for both parent and child - emphasizing that introversion is not a disease or character defect. I was also interested in the research in psychology and brain studies that I was not previously aware of. In short, an informative and useful good read.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sandberg's gem of a book includes just the right mix of statistics, anecdotes, and life lessons to be valuable to any woman in business. A fresh look at the reality of many women's work/life balance today, along with some good lessons and suggestions for success in both areas.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book improves on the last one in terms of style of writing, however the content leaves the reader wanting more. Perhaps this is the unavoidable pitfall of the middle book in a trilogy.<br />Worth reading if you've read the first.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a master at delving into human emotion and really trying to look at all sides of an issue. An excellent read.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Excellent!!! love it,...We can live in a world full of discrimination, but if you give the best of you, people will notice the difference.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Bullock is SO perfect in her role in this movie and her romantic interest/dude is funnier than I've seen him before. Rent it! BUT, go HD as the Alaskan scenery is worth the extra buck.

0788859544|2.0|One of the DVDs came VERY scratched up! This was disappointing as the DVD kept skipping which made it frustrating to watch with a toddler
B008C20TDG|4.0|I finished the whole30 diet as prescribed in this book yesterday, and waited until now to review the book so that I could reflect on the process of implementing the eating plan in it. I had good results from my 30 grain-free, dairy-free, sugar- and sugar-substitute-free, bean-free days. I lost 11 pounds, don't feel as achy as I did before, have clearer skin, greater mental clarity throughout the day, and to some extent more energy (though not the boundless energy that others report).  I also don't crave sweets as much and don't tend to get hungry between meals. I'd struggled to lose weight on other diets without much success, so I'm very pleased with how well whole30 worked for me.<br /><br />But the process of getting through the plan is a challenge. It requires a willingness to cook most (if not all) of your own meals, change countless habits, say NO to yourself quite often, and work through a stretch of days when you're probably going to feel pretty crappy. The book makes it clear that the benefits of the diet aren't realized until at least mid-way through the 30 days for most people. I also would imagine that the failure rate for those who attempt to do a whole30 is high (my husband tried to do it with it and didn't make it three days). Any \\"slips\\" or \\"cheats\\" require you to start over at day 1. Eating out is a real challenge, since soybean oil isn't allowed and most restaurants use it in food preparation and condiments and hidden sugars also are frequently found in prepared foods. There are few options available from quick-service restaurants and none from fast food places.<br /><br />My main critique of the book is that the science on some of the eating rules is more solid than on others. The authors overstate the case against both dairy and legumes and require followers not monitor their weight-loss progress in any way other than clothing fit during the whole30. Weighing in is a practice found to be associated with greater weight loss in several studies, so the rationale for this rule is weak. I'd like to see them sponsor some research on the results of whole30, in terms of percentage of people who complete it, immediate results at day 30, and long-term weight loss and health results. The book contains many anecdotes of whole30 followers claiming that this way of eating cured them of various conditions and diseases. It would be great to see empirical evidence to back up these stories.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend giving the whole30 a try if you can go all-in for 30 days. I'm glad I did.
B000HGDWW0|2.0|This is a really nice watch and the price was super.  I like the black face with the stylish hands(red second hand)-classy.  Only one small complaint and thats adjusting the band.  Seiko suggests taking the watch to their service center to have a link taken out of the band and thats a little over the top for me.  It really is more difficult to make these adjustments than most watches I own and I am comparing this one to some pretty nice competitors.  However, this little problem is not enough to cause me major concerns and the quality, appearance and reputation of Seiko watches easily outweighs the concerns of the band.  I would recommend this one highly.<br />Update to above:  Had this watch about a week now and find that it stops periodically while I am wearing it.  To add to that, the 12 o'clock indicator has now fallen off and is floating free inside the dial.  Guess I spoke too soon about the quaility above.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was great.  I would recommend anyone who likes romance novels to get this book.  Good love story and well written.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|First question, has Sean Penn aged badly or was that make up? If it wasn't poor guy! Violent theme so there should be shoot outs and people killed. I thought it was done well. I think Josh Brolin was believable. Inspired by a true story so it did peak my interest to see how accurate the story line was.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The performances and pacing of the film, as well as the premise are excellent, if disturbing. The role of the Nicole character seems underdeveloped and the conclusion is somewhat weak and too predictable.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|Such a good cd, love her love her songs and love the 3 disks. i got it and it looked brand new!! no scratches!
B007FJFDXS|3.0|Its an okay game, I didn't play it much, but when I did it kept me moderately entertained. 3 stars

B0002KPIQY|4.0|Angelina in all her glory being shown  prominently. She looks gorgeous and I wonder if she would do this movie now that she is famous.
B005KR6NS6|4.0|Enjoyed the cinematography.  Dance scenes very believable for a beginner going to amateur & of course the older woman and younger man love tryst  always adds the drama.<br />Thoroughly enjoyed the movie but just a little something that I can't put my mind on that I didn't enjoy, so I'll have to watch it again !!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Is this a message about how batman really is just another tool of the 99%?  and the 99% are led by a faction of crazed folks from unknown parts?
6305428425|5.0|I love this film and have ever since I saw it in the theater. I used to watch for it on TV, but now I've decided to invest in the DVD and I'm happy I have. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow star as Romy and Michelle, two clueless high school friends from Arizona who now live together in LA. When Romy runs into an old high school classmate (Jeanne Garofalo, who I usually like) at work, Romy and Michelle decide to go to their 10th high school reunion. But they decide to make up cover stories about themselves so they can be seen as successful career women, which they're not. So they drive across the desert in a borrowed Jag reliving various high school memories. When they get there, the old popular girls are still total witches and treat them pretty shabbily -- except for one who is now a fashion editor and compliments them on the clothes they've made to wear. Meanwhile, as a side note, Garofalo is also there, hooking up with a mysterious cowboy from her high school past. The ending is pretty predictable, but pretty funny nonetheless and while this isn't a highbrow comedy, this movie is a very funny comedy and worth a good viewing or two. Recommended.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The story is not so bad but a little too slow for me. Also it was hard to understand a lot of their conversations. I took really long to finish it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We do not have television so our son recommended this to me as he knows my interest in this kind of movie.  I have read the first book, so I was interested in seeing this.  I thought it was a great presentation and enjoyed it very much and feel they did an excellent job sticking with the book, however I never can understand why those who make projects to be shown on TV or even in the theatre seem to feel that making it as sexual graphic as possible will bring in patrons.  I am certainly no prude, but I found the over abundance of frontal nudity and graphic sexual intercourse scenes totally tacky and unnecessary....actually, I've seen porno movies with less.  My son says the next season is not as bad and I certainly hope so.  I am stunned that this kind of presentation is even on TV...I knew there was a reason we unplugged it many years ago.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I bought this for a gift and the person receiving it loved it.  I had seen it before and thought it would be perfect for him.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I have the mobile version of FB but was never able to get the full version for my Kindle Fire until now. The only thing that doesn't work are the games. No big deal really! I have enjoyed this app and you will too!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Absolutely magical, very historical, and surprisingly scientific. A nice mix of romance, suspense, and intrigue. Looking forward to reading the whole trilogy
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|An interesting twist by having a child at the centre of the story. As usual, the end is imminently foreseeable and yet it surprises.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is an excellent book written by a professional who did not believe in God or Heaven until his death experience of going to Heaven and then, coming back. Very believeable.loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone, but esp to the non-believer who doubts there is an afterlife--eternal life with Jesus after this life here on earth!  Laurie Murphy, Billings, Montana
B007V4530A|5.0|I thought this book was an easy read.  It is written by someone who has a real passion of TED talks which makes it all the better.  I like the reviews at the end of each chapter that highlights the important points.<br /><br />I found myself not wanting to put the book down.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because I liked the book, thought it was easy reading and for the money gave the reader an incredible amount of insight and ideas from TED.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|First one was forgetting commands within days. You should only have to program everything once in short time if you fully read the instructions. I returned it for full refund and simply repurchased it (price went down since prior purchaes). 2nd one worked PERFECTLY. i STRONGLY recommend that you buy remote control candles to go along with it. Turning on battery candles and screaming lumis or incendio will never get old.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Was inspired by Anita's expierence.  Brings clarity to who and what we really are.  Highly recommend for those looking for answers.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I started watching this movie,not sure what to expect. As a proud dog mama, I was brought to flowing tears of love and sadness while Hachi sat everyday,for 9 years,waiting for the professor to get off that train.<br />Make sure you have Kleenex next to you when watching this movie!
B002VHI8J0|4.0|Mitchell captures many characters and situations with great insight and interest.  Having read it, I was tempted to draw a mindmap of these lives and their linkages, but didn't feel like tackling the puzzle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent read; a little slow up front, well worth continuing to read.  Dialogue is intriguing, develops characters throughly and consistently.
B008220C56|5.0|The original is one of my absolute favorites but I love how the remake puts that modern spin without taking away from the period of the story.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I enjoyed this book because there are very interesting examples of habits and how they impact every day lives.  I would recommend.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I was pleased with this mobile. It did the job. It was however a bit rough to install. I had to cut a hole in a washcloth & place it between the mobile and crib so that the attachment wheel wouldn't scrape against the wood crib.<br /><br />I loved the remote feature, it was nice to be able to turn it on for a second cycle without entering my daughters room!
B003I55BIA|5.0|I pegged how the book was going to start and end, but not how they were all going to get there!
B008Y6SLL2|5.0|This is definitely a thinking man's movie. Very well written and acted. A corporate thriller and we loved it! Jeremy Irons' character was spot on for a man in g is position within the corporate world.
B008P9M614|5.0|If you are just looking for every episode of House, and not looking for any special collectors only edition, this will work for you. They made each season fit into one DVD case. It is of high quality, reasonably priced, complete with all episodes and a minimum amount of extra &#34;additional&#34; features. Each DVD case contains there was a very brief synopsis of each episode, which is useful. The subtitles are in English and Spanish, Spanish subs are well translated. One disc of each season contains &#34;special features&#34;. The set contains a small pamphlet with &#34;House-isms&#34;; there is also a Season & Episode guide to help you find a special episode without having to open and search each DVD case. There is a section that addresses the ideas of how House was developed as well as how the characters were developed and also a section with some quotes. I really enjoyed this set.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|Great holiday read - not overly taxing, but funny, heartfelt and endlessly entertaining. A bonus for me was that Graeme Simsion is a Melbourne writer and the book is full of Melbourne landmarks.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is a real &#34;page turner&#34; and I was never bored.  David Baldacci is a talented storyteller.  I will definitely read more of his novels.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|First bought this album in 1982 when living in Germany in the USAF.  It was and still is the greatest piano rock and roll compilation ever.  Billy Joel can still bring it too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Much like Myst. Graphics are good and puzzles got me real addicted to this game. It's worth the $2! I like how the app uses the most functionality from your device (tilt, and touchscreen motion).
B005DJREJS|3.0|Interesting way to put in positive perspective the regretable choices we take. As a tv show obviously, things end up looking good for the main actress.. regardless of the nastiness of the situation. Sadly, in real life, people take away their own lives for just one of the many things that happen to her.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|I had to adjust the delay a bit but now it works great. It is fun to use for notes & lists.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's a great show. Nice blend of Sci-Fi, Western frontier and class warfare. Good cast of actors who've all gone on to other shows. Very sad it only lasted one season... what were the networks thinking. I'm sure we all wanted another regurgitated cop show or silly comedy (ha ha).
B002ZG983M|3.0|America needs hero's, and this movie gives hero's from unexpected sources. It's a fun movie. And, fun for all ages.
B0087240Z4|2.0|I could only really get into a couple of songs. The album is kinda ass otherwise. Maybe Billy should consider retiring.

B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a great way to pass the time.  It never gets old.  I play it everyday.  Solitaire it is a classic.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read and re-read this book.  Each time picking up a few more facts and pieces.  I highly recommend this novel.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Dissappointed in this version of the solitare game.  I prefer what I have on my phone.  Will be removing it most likely.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book was excellent.  Great pacing, great characters.  Surprisingly funny.  I immediately went and bought the sequels after I finished it.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very versatile, with many combinations available. I especially like the use brainwave science to improve concentration, etc. The ability to create favorites was a real plus.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Interesting and absorbing.  Great for a rainy Saturday afternoon. I would recommend, especailly if you like Denzel Washington.  He gave a great performance.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game I love the graphics and the story line love love this game very educational I'm learning a lot about coral reefs and the different fish that live in them
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I bought this after watching the PBS program. Sounded like a good idea, and my doctor approved. So far, I've fasted 4 or 5 days, and it's not that hard. Not really fasting, of course--just modified fasting. You eat two moderate meals, and skip the large one, probably dinner. Always results in a loss of one or two pounds, but the trick is in not making up for it on the non-fasting days. I do that with sensible eating and lots of exercise.<br />Half chaff--the book is only half text. The second half is recipes and testimonials, which are not of interest to me.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I was so happy to  finish Season 8. The mythology continues to strengthen and is always interesting. Watching Dean befriend and defend a vampire demonstrated the maturing of his inner self. Even a \\"monster\\" may deserve respect.<br />Sam  turns out to be the righteous hero despite his personality flaws..
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This was incredibly easy.  Downloaded the app, it found my HP C7280 printer and it ran perfectly without me having me do anything.

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian is Book Two in The Three Nations Trilogy. Once again, Christoph Fischer has given us a novel with a historical backdrop. It is a story about a Jewish family that doesn't really practice their religion or get caught up in the politics of the day but nonetheless is still held to that prejudice by others. Sebastian is about the trials and tribulations of one family, about loyalty, about human failings, and the inner strength it takes to get through difficult times.<br /><br />The book begins when Sebastian loses his leg due to an infection that went untreated. It seems the sixteen-year-old boy has a terrible fear of doctors and needles and told no one about his wound until it was way too late.<br /><br />The one event takes us on a journey through Sebastian's life as he grows from an insecure boy to manhood. The author weaves a clever tale using subplots and character development to include the women who come and go in Sebastian's life and the approaching war that defines the time period.<br /><br />Like Fischer's first book in the trilogy, The Luck of the Weissensteiners, the author has another winner here with his textured storyline and vivid characters. As I did with his first book, I felt as though I was back in that time period, a true gift from a superb author.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|The sensor sees shadows in it's edges due to the frame of the Zoom, so high movement games like Zumba don't always track wide angled movements very well.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I saw this book in an online book club & thought I'd give it a try.  So glad I did.<br />First of all, the transforming of time felt so real.  The time when people were owned as slaves... I can't even imagine.  & then enters a little white girl into the home of slaves, who take her as their own & love her as family.<br />You see so many people in the book who come & go... the life of working on a plantation & how others saw so little in other people simply because of the color of their skin... but yet, love still prevails for some who see nothing but the heart of a person.<br />I gasped at times, I cried at times... I got so mad at times... this book held me the whole way through.

B0000012VG|5.0|Alongside such works as Saint-Saens' \\"Danse Macabre\\", and Berlioz's \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\", Modest Mussorgsky's \\"A Night On Bald Mountain\\" is one of the best-known works to delve into the world of the macabre.  But what is not so well known is the fact that this \\"musical painting\\", as the composer called it, was worked at in four different permutations, both during the composer's life, and long after he had died.  Three of these are purely orchestral in nature: the arrangement made by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov that the vast majority of the music-listening public has most often heard; the arrangement by Leopold Stokowski for the final segment of Disney's 1940 animated classic FANTASIA (which segues into Franz Schubert's beloved \\"Ave Maria\\"); and the composer's own extremely primitive original orchestration.  It is this latter one that is the centerpiece of this 1994 Deutsche Grammophon recording by Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />Whereas most recordings of \\"Night\\" utilize the re-orchestration that Rimsky-Korsakov made, supposedly at the composer's suggestion (with its tranquil conclusion, after all that nightmarism), Abbado, on his second recording of the work, has chosen to stick with the composer's own version; and although exceptionally primitive, it can be argued that this work went a long way to laying the groundwork for Igor Stravinsky in the first fifteen years of the 20th century (\\"The Firebird\\", and, especially, \\"The Rite Of Spring\\" may owe quite a lot to this work).  It is an interesting concept that Abbado and the Berliners float here; and the recording is made even more interesting by the presence of four of the composer's works for chorus and orchestra: \\"The Destruction Of Sennacherib\\"; \\"Salammbo\\"; \\"Oedipus In Athens\\", and \\"Joshua.\\"  These are works that may owe a debt to the short works for chorus and orchestra that Brahms had done (e.g. \\"Alto Rhapsody\\", \\"Nanie\\", etc.), but which are nowhere near as well known, for the simple reason that they are in Russian.  Abbado concludes this recording with the composer's famous piano piece \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\" in the orchestral transcription by Maurice Ravel that, in spite of many other competing versions (including Stokowski's), still remains the one the public wants to hear the most.<br /><br />Because Abbado and the Berliners went and did the choral version of \\"Night On Bald Mountain\\" for Sony two years later, and because this particular version of the work had been recorded by Abbado back in the early 1980s for RCA with the London Symphony Orchestra, one can legitimately wonder if Mussorgsky is to Abbado what Mahler was for, say, Leonard Bernstein: a personal obsession.  This is probably far-fetched, but it's then better to say that Abbado had a knack for delving into very little known aspects of Mussorgsky's compositional output to find things of value, things that, while they may be upwards of a century and a half old by this time, still feel new.  Such is the case on this recording, which is why close attention should be paid to it.mple reason that they are in Russian.

B004IPPINW|5.0|This is a great book for a book club because it provokes a lively, significant discussion. The main character's behavior and choices can be interpreted on many levels. It is very timely to our lives in the U.S. between the Occupy Wall Street movement and concern about terrorists and immigration. It is written beautifully - very engaging and in the end, leaving a question that is answered differently by each reader.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|The second book felt like the authors were character developing more than story telling.<br />The story between Ridley and Link is more endearing than the leads (no spoilers) but I will be reading the next book for them.<br />Beautiful darkness is an ok follow up. It is what it is, a light read.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|first episode was great, kept you guessing.  Good thriller.  I am going to keep watching. I will recommend giving it a shot at least.
0061900656|3.0|This is a cute book, but it may not be the best for a blended family situation. It could be confusing for a child that is gaining a new half-sibling from a step parent. One page \\"Mommy and daddy show me pictures. Pictures of when I was a baby.\\"  The preview pages don't show any \\"mom\\" and \\"dad\\" language. It only focuses on the kids. Some situations this may be fine and not have any problems. Some, this could be disastrous and turn something that could have been sweet into difficulty and confusion.

B00B7VZN76|5.0|\\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" truly hit its stride with the third season. With the addition of Ron Moore and others to the writing staff, the third season flew into uncharted territories with a series of strong stories, acting, direction, performances and episodes that dealt with morally complex issues such as terrorism, the definition of humanity and even an echo of Rashômon in one episode.<br /><br />The transfer done by CBS here is nothing short of exceptional. I did note some minor issues in two shots of \\"The Hunted\\" but that is the only episode so far in the set. Occasionally, some close ups are a bit soft but I suspect that has to do with the photography of the show for those shots.<br /><br />There is one shot uprezzed from the original videotape for \\"The Survivors\\" as the elements couldn't be found.<br /><br />The show finally settled on a film stock that would provide nice, sharp and vivid detail without the excessive grain of the first two seasons. That, along with a new director of photography, allowed the look of the show to be both distinctive, textured and rich something that wasn't as evident on the original DVDs or the original broadcast of the show.<br /><br />The restoration team has managed to find that fine balance between the darker textures of the show and bold colors of the show. The visual effects look top notch throughout and where the effects team that worked on the restoration for the planets, there's an astonishing level of detail.<br /><br />As with the first two seasons subtitles are provided in English and other multiple langauges and the menu allows you to select from many langauges as well for the show itself.<br /><br />The special features include a commentary on \\"The Bonding\\" by Ronald D. Moore, Michael and Denise Okuda; \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" by Ronald D. Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Michael & Denise Okuda plus another commentary track by director David Carson; \\"The Offspring\\" commentary by Rene Echevarria, Michael & Denise Okuda; \\"Sins of the Father\\" commentary by Ronald D. Moore, Dan Curry, Michael & Denise Okuda. We also get a number of terrific featurettes including \\"Inside the Writer's Room\\" moderated by Seth McFarlane and a three part documentary entitled \\"Assimiliating Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" both in HD. There are also tributes to the late writer Michael Piller, the scenes shot with the late David Rappaport for the episode \\"The Most Toys\\". We also get all the original episode promos as well as the special features from the original DVD sets.<br /><br />CBS has done a terrific job with this set making up for some of the shortcomings evident in the season two Blu-rays (and, despite those shortcomings, the season two set is still worth picking up)and the quality of this set continues to bode well for the rest of the sets in this set.<br /><br />Highly recommended.; \\"Sins of the Father\\" commentary by Ronald D.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Masterful mystery and plot twist that suck in the reader and then tricks us into believing. Gillian Flynn's husband must sleep with one eye open.........masterful!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|There have been quite a few movies done about reincarnation. \\"Dead Again\\" was probably one of the best, but while it used reincarnation to advance the plot, it was actually a love story/murder mystery. This movie also embraces the themes of love and mystery but it does so by delving into issues of personal growth and how these successive (or concurrent since since time does not exist) lives and loves add or subtract from who we are as people.<br /><br />You won't find characters looking for hypnotist to regress them and tell them who they are, instead, you watch as they meet various aspects of themselves again and again. There is no explaining. These lives are left open for you to contemplate. The time period spans from the 1800's to a distant future world which in some respects we may be heading toward. Has Monsanto not recently sought to patent natural plants. How long before it patents clones of people? Can you own and duplicate a human being? Frankly I wouldn't put anything past congress and in the future segment of this movie..they have done just that.<br /><br />There are six stories in the film which shift back and forth constantly. We see the characters grow and change as they meet variations on the themes in their previous lives which all run concurrently through the story. If you are a film buff who likes to delve into the technical aspects, you will appreciate the use of matching or form cuts that make the movie run seamlessly.<br /><br />The movie is long, but there a is a lot to watch and I don't think I would have liked it as well if I were limited to one sitting in a theater. I watched it in 3 sittings and want to go back and see it again to fully appreciate the interwoven details. Most of the people who have not liked this found it disjointed. I didn't find that at all, but if you like a story that runs from start to finish without asking you to contemplate much, this is not for you.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Great game worth every penny<br />I am looking forward to getting more g5 games.Great graphics and great story too. A lot of fun
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Video won't open up I can't post to people walls and I'm not paying for that other s*** forget it
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Interesting and at times funny.  Provided a history of the times and social siutations of the last hundred years through the main characters insertion of himself into historical situations.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It opens ones eyes as to how horriffic things were during the civil war and how truly great Lincoln was!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I read this book mainly to see if I wanted to recommend it to my daughter, who is just beginning her career with a large corporation. I think it is an excellent book for young women to read, so they can be exposed to her experienced opinions as they begin making their own career choices. I worked part-time and full-time while raising my four children (she is the baby!), mainly out of necessity. Though I feel that staying home and raising the children is more important than career advancement, I found nothing upsetting or \\"wrong\\" about Ms. Sandberg's opinions. She is not ramming her way down your throat - just explaining her choices and making some insightful observations.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it for anyone.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Everyone should see this movie and then take action in their community - it's time to fight these vandals everyone!

B00AF7Z44K|5.0|Merlin has been a favorite show if my wife and I since it first came out.  We now own all 5 seasons on dvd and couldn't be happier with them.  Season three is awesome -- the episodes follow a great storyline and some big events happen on the kingdom of Camelot.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I think I know where it's going then a totally unexpected ending. The ending could have been a chapter longer. Kind of like the author had to finish quickly.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is a great time killer and you don't have to spend money as long as you have time to wait for energy to regenerate.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This movie was very funny at certain parts but the overall tone was very depressing and felt like you were watching a couple fight and resent eachother for 2 and a half hours.  Not very rom or com.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loving this series..very interesting ,can't wait to continue the story. I wonder if we'll all end up in silos , might happen someday the way we take everything for granted these days
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Just a good movie.  Daniel Day Lewis did Lincoln justice.  Just memorizing and non stop educational enhancement.  If you didn't know, you will know
0375703764|5.0|This book was extremely scaring and disturbing. It paints a frightening picture of a world just below the surface and beyond the understanding of our own.<br /><br />It was also very moving and has excellent characterization and development of the characters.<br /><br />In addition, it does some very interesting things with self-reference, formatting.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|This movie is excellent and powerful no matter how many times that I watch it!  It is motivational and it is something that I recommend for everyone to see. It doesn't follow the bible exactly-the real drama would've been rated NC17 for the nakedness on the cross and for the plucking out of Christ's beard which they did not dramatize- but it is about as close as I have seen.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|Best show I have seen since The Sopranos. Although kind of upset they killed james off so early its still a great show. I think its how ruthless they are that keeps me watching and half of the story is true.
B0060D31N4|4.0|A bit risque to use in a classroom and it makes several key plot changes like making Prospero into a woman. Russell Brand is fabulous and definitely makes the video worth it.<br /><br />It is beautifully filmed and well acted! Not many other options out there for the Tempest either!
B0026S93C0|5.0|This movie it timeless.  It has a lot of great dance scene's with a bit of comedy and romance added.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a wonderfully photographed film with a compelling story and compelling characters in extraordinary circumstances.<br />Satisfying both science fiction and fantasy genres, The Hunger Games offers much more than entertainment for parents and those eager to see films with real meaning that demonstrate the consequences of action, The Hunger games poses tough questions while presenting difficult moral dilemmas sure to spark family conversation. This one is going into my DVD collection. Be advised that while not truly gory, this film suggests murderous violence (powerful because it is more suggested than shown), and contains some pretty sad moments, albeit offset by triumph. Be brave, there's nothing going on here worse than the content of a Grimm's Fairy Tale, but hold on to those between the ages of eight and eleven, and the generally tender-hearted. A must see, beautifully acted, inventive, and fascinating to watch.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A friend of mine was telling me about this apps and about how great it is; I just said, &#34;uh-huh, we'll see&#34;, but to my surprise, its a great app. Lots of different screens, different levels, just all-around fun. If you like adventure, getting loot, and avoiding a big, hairy, bear-like creature (well, that what it looks like to me), get this app; if you don't like it, just delete, its free!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Such a wonderful and fast read. The character development was fantastic. It made me love my own dog in a new way.
B004UPANGM|5.0|It's Evil Dead 2.  Great movie, never gets old and the humor rocks.  One of my favorites.  If you like this and have not seen it, check out Army of Darkness next.
B009IA9OLE|2.0|After reading the raving review left by others, I finally decided to try this game.  It's a cute game but after about 10 minutes it gets repetitive and boring.  There is absolutely no challenge whatsoever, if you lose, you just try again until you win the case then you buy furniture for his apartment, then you try a case, then you buy furniture....  Sorry, I just don't see the appeal.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Drinks from so many other books of the same kind... however, stays up to expectations along the story and leaves the reader with questions for more.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a great game! I was glad I paid tobolay until the end it was well worth it. I can't wait to play # 2
B00475AYJQ|2.0|Worst than the first novel of the series, lingers a bit too much in teenager Twilight- like scenes and unnecessary long pieces of the story...
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I would buy a building and it would never finish building and still take my coins and I never figured out the elements
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Artistic and creative capturing of a real life event.  Suspenseful and empathetic.  Beautiful!<br />I think Affleck is a a better director than actor, but in this one, he shines.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|I read the book and greatly enjoyed it.  It was fast reading and very touching.  But, if you don't read the book 1st, you are missing a lot by only viewing the movie.  Read the book 1st, and you'll be more likely to appreciate the movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I learned a lot from reading this book and highly recommend it.  I will probably never have the opportunity to hike the Pacific Coast Trail but merely reading the book put me right out there on the trail with Cheryl Strayed.  Excellent book.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|In Season Three of The Next Generation you can tell everyone hit their strides, the actors, the producers, the writers, the directors, everyone.  The storytelling in the third season is so rich,the characters became consistent, and the infusion of more drama and comedy made it feel so much more alive than the first and second seasons.<br /><br />The number of standout episodes in the third season is staggering.  Brent Spiner stood out this season.  His work in \\"The Offspring\\" took Data to a whole new level.  I also enjoyed \\"Deja Q\\" because Data gets to laugh.  \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" is an obvious winner, as were \\"Sarek,\\" \\"Sins of the Father,\\" and \\"The Enemy.\\"  I really can't think of an episode from the third season that I just didn't like.<br /><br />As with the first two blu ray season sets, the VAM (or extras) on this set are spectacular.  Seth MacFarlane's conversion with Ron Moore, Naren Shankar, Rene Echevarria and Brannon Braga (Inside the Writer's Room) was engaging to watch.  It was nice to get the writers' perspectives on what worked and didn't work, series rules they had to follow.  The other interesting aspect of that documentary from a fan's point-of-view, is to get perspectives and insights of people who were just as involved as the actors that we never saw.  The other documentary, the three part \\"Regeneration,\\" is informative and full of new information.  Some of the commentary on the three-part documentary is very frank ... many of the people interviewed really speak their mind about what was going on and what they thought.  I found the tribute to Michael Piller very touching.  I wonder if Season Five will have a tribute to Gene ...<br /><br />The picture quality is top notch.  To those who complain about the MSRP of $130 per season set ... Amazon has never charged anywhere close to that much.  Season Four is currently for sale for $90, just like the first three when they were made available to pre-order.  If you wait to pre-order, you will likelybe able to pre-order close to the release date for about $77 (which is what I pre-ordered Season Three for), and then Amazon will refund your card the difference.  Season Three was priced on release day at $59.99 (that was yesterday), I already have the refund on my card.  $59.99 is not unreasonable when you consider the amount of painstaking (and expensive) work that goes into remastering TNG into HD.  As for the newly produced bonus material ... producing these documentaries and reunions and new interviews is also not a cheap endeavor, and to put it into perspective ... when TNG first came to DVD in (I think) 2002, maybe it was late 2001 (?) those season sets cost about $120 per set and there was no deep discount for them.  Back then you paid MSRP if you wanted them.  TV on DvD was a relatively new concept.<br /><br />That said, these sets are not for casual fans.  Casual fans or new fans really aren't going to get much out of these newly recorded interviews, reunions and documentaries.  If you are a casual fan I would simply suggest watching them in HD on Amazon Prime after the Blus come out.  You can watch the whole series but they will only broadcast in HD the seasons that are actually available in HD.  I love my Netflix membership, and I'm grateful Netflix carries all the Trek series but the picture and audio quality for Trek on Netflix is bad.<br /><br />If you want to experience Trek in true HD, if you want and enjoy all of the newly recorded and newly found bonus material, then buy these sets.  They are well worth the price.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Very well acted, and life reaffirming.  Naomi Watts is amazing.  Well cast and visually impressive.<br /><br />Movie leaves you feeling awestruck and asking how the scenes were filmed.

B005EGXNLS|5.0|Having been born and grew up in England, this book brought back many fond memories of the history and lore of the land of my birth.

B004XWLN20|5.0|I read the reviews from other customers and I for one have absolutely no complaints so far. Yes, the discs are packed in tight but as long as you're careful and take your time pulling them out and putting them back, you shouldn't have any problems. If it would make you feel more comfortable,  you could always go and get a cd case big enough to hold all 62 discs and still have the books as part of your memorabilia collection
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|I absolutely adore this artist. I love every single track. There is not a song I do not enjoy. Her sweet, inviting tone accompanies novel instruments that just make this wonderful and unique. Keep on making music, Daughter!<br />Highly recommended for those who like folk and soft alternative. Jazz fans may like this as well. None of her songs are \\"crazy\\", \\"racy\\" or \\"wild\\", and most contain sad or depressing tones. Is that bad? No. It's heartwarming.

In all honesty there is a lot of propaganda in the movie, but the storyline of friendship and caring for each other is what the kids remember most. My husband I love picking out voices of familiar people in Disney movies and in Wall-E we also pick out themes, music, or scenarios that are reminiscent of other movies like Star Wars and many others! The only thing that peeves me everytime I hear it is the phrase, &#34;stay the course&#34;, ugh! It would be nice if Disney would keep their politics out of my kids shows.
B008VVT51U|5.0|&#34;Marigold Hotel&#34; is a movie of substance.  Not only is it beautiful to see, but it is thought provoking.  You won't walk away from this one and forget about it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I downloaded this for my grandson,  but it's a little old for him,  so I. started playing it myself.  very enjoyable,  but I dislike the coersion required at the point where you are required to buy the &quot;extraor.  dinary mystery seeds &quot;, which requires a purchase.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what it says it does and keeps track of what you' re doing. Just what I needed.  Would recommend
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|And I can't wait for the next two. And while they did add to the story, none of the additions detracted from it.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I first saw this on TV and loved it and bought the DVD.  I don't mind watching a great movie several times.
B00BF123WG|5.0|The initial part of the movie surprised me with all the darkness, making me think the movie was damaged, but that portion was to highlight the night.  Lots of action, great movie.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Crap, this is one BAD movie!  If by any slim chance I run into the writer/director Apatow, I'm going to ask for me $4 back for renting the movie.  There was VERY FEW funny parts - it was just mainly Mann or Rudd constantly complaining about their upper class suburban lifestyle.  Boring and VERY snotty!!
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|We have purchased several of these types of games for our son and this is the only one that has kept his interest.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Excellent movie; tells a gripping story of survival of a whole family in the Sunami.<br />Well done.  Scenery very realistic, casting believable.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a BlueRay with impeccable quality. I am very much impressed by the product and a wonderful addition to my movie collectible.
0425263908|5.0|Absolutely awesome read. I highly recommend this series to anyone trying to survive in a tough relationship. This series is probably my favorite. I cannot wait until book 3 is released.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|A very interesting view into the mind and home life of Alfred Hitchcock. Anthony Hopkins once again acts his part so well that you forget it's him and just focus on the character.  Helen Mirren is always excellent. Scarlett Johanssen tried to play Janet Leigh as smart and as professional as she was supposed to be - though I'm not sure she pulled it off.  The actor portraying Anthony Perkins seemed to be playing Norman Bates rather than Anthony Perkins but perhaps there are more similarities there than I am aware. I was pleased that the Hitchcock's marriage was shown to be a loving, though imperfect, partnership and proved the saying, 'behind every good man is a great (and very tired) woman.'
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag quickly and I love it.  It has plenty of room for my camera, lenses, books, with plenty of room left over.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game surprised me in how much I really enjoy it. Got it for my granddaughter who is too young to build it but old enough to enjoy watching and touching the fish. I'm finding it relaxing while I add to her reef.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney poured her heart out on this CD and you could tell<br />she gave her all.  For me, it is one of the finer pieces of work<br />that I have ever bought of Whitney's and believe me, I have<br />bought many.  She will forever be the queen of soul/r&b to me<br />God rest her soul!  I love you Whiitney!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love the demo i gotta purchase the full game it kept me on edge i cant wait to continue to play im going to buy it now
B0057XMCLA|5.0|We watched Eragon with our 13 year old daughter and 10 year old son.  We enjoyed the dragons, adventure, and good storyline.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very cute I like the nemo music, its cool attracting differant fish's. so far very interesting and interactive. nice graphics.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|My first book by this author.  I was so disappointed. I was expecting this to be a good read, since author is so popular. It was so slow and boring. It seems like he copied and pasted.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I just cant get to play it enough . I was just on it again but I have to stop at time because of my eyes .
B0033AGPFS|2.0|After I heard Are you experienced on vinyl and was blown away, I bought this one too, it is the same year of reissue 2010 as Are you experienced, I thought the quality will be the same, but it is not. Sound of this vinyl is too bright. Lack of depth in the sound is something I dont like, therefor the the review is such. I dont recommend this vinyl.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app. I enjoy the fact that when I need to know the current temperature or rain status immediately all I have to do is just go to my my drop menu and it is automatically showing.
B00005JY1O|5.0|I bought Highway 61 Revisited on vinyl in mono. The sound is great, mono version open up some interesting new details. I recommend it.
B009R659L8|4.0|I liked the sisters relationship and with jessie. The fire investigator angle was interesting and its discovery process. I always like interesting men
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Enjoyed the time period. I didn't't worry about vulgar language or being uncomfortable if my young grandchildren walked in while I was watching the show.  I look forward to seeing more episodes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The whole series was riveting.  I read them straight through.  Now I wish I had the physical books so I could pass them on.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie.  The story line was good especially since it was based on true events.  I would recommend this movie as a family friendly choice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The story about the fights between what is left of humanity (the non dead) are in fact what will must likely happen in a post apocalyptic scenario!
B003MX6QPU|2.0|This was a very strange and at time very boring movie.  It had a weird plot and I would not recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It's a good movie. I saw it recently do I wanted to read the book because I heard it was good.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book quite simply did nothing short of change my life. Just read it. I dare you to follow it's advice.
B00985E3UG|4.0|it gives us a very clear picture of how the current food industry hooks us on all the wrong foods!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Probably the best Men in Black yet. Very enjoyable.  Will Smith is just fun to watch.  A very interesting plot.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|It looks like that America has to uncover its creativity to win the true competition.<br />What is the true competition? China has taken over the jobs of obedient hard-working people. In order to survive, the United States has to reveal its true genius, become creative and indispensable, the linchpin of the world economy.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Back in the Atari days, I would spend all night playing space invaders and I have missed it.  This is very much like it.  The big improvements aren't realistic graphics (still simple, but they are better).  Instead of hiding behind a fortress and moving left and right, you can move all around the screen.  There are a lot more categories of invader and more things you can hit to give you more powers and more points.<br />Bottom line: If you are OLD, like me, and you really liked space invaders, you will love this.  If you are young and see all things atari as antiques, you will love it too.<br />One more thing.  You will not find it too easy.  I think it will continue to provide a challange as you move to higher levels.
B000FA675C|5.0|I like the Kindle app and the dictionary.<br />Especially the dictionary is so helpful in Kindle app.<br />Thanks for that
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful. I love it when you watch a movie and when it is done, you can still talk about it. This movie does just that. If you are a thinker and love to analyze things, then you will love this movie. The way it ends can challenge everything that you just saw. Loved it.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice starts off with a bit of a question mark, and you may feel like you're being toyed with, as if there is nothing of consequence about to happen. But with each moment that passes, you're drawn into the mystery and intrigue of missing persons, conspiracies, potential mental breakdowns, and a sadistic plot. Dana is believable as the main character, and while she is the unlikely heroine and there are lots of overtones of the typical 'no one believes me because I'm a psych patient' set-up, she's an individual, who comes off as unique and interesting. Every time you think you've found the direction the story's going, there's another plot twist that keeps you guessing, all the way to the end. And though I personally am left wanting an expansion with more detail of the history of all characters involved, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the overall work.
B000H72824|5.0|The Lion King is definitely one of Disney's best animated films, but that's not really what my review is about. No, this review has to do with the original theatrical release of the film and all of the tinkering that had been done since it's original release. For those who may not remember, Disney re-released this film in IMAX theaters back around 2002 as a Special Edition, and made a number of changes from it's original release back in 1994. These changes ranged from re-drawing a group of singing crocodiles during the song \\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\\", changing some of the backgrounds, and adding in a new song called \\"The Morning Report\\". This Special Edition is what we got when the film was released on Platinum Edition DVD (which also claimed to include the original release of the film, but was actually just the Special Edition minus the \\"Morning Report\\" song). Most recently the film had been released on Blu-ray after it's 3D release in theaters, and eagle eye viewers might be able to spot even further changes to the film, most notably the scene where Adult Simba is seen running after the ghost of Mufasa as he leaves. Where in the original there was a nice piece of effects animation with the clouds disappearing, now Simba is chasing after a completely blank sky.<br /><br />Because of all this, the original unaltered theatrical release of The Lion King has never truly been available on DVD or Blu-ray. However we DID get it by way of it's original VHS release as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection, but for those looking to watch the film in widescreen this release of the film was also available on LaserDisc. For any classic Disney fan wanting to watch this film the way it was originally made, I highly recommend the LaserDisc release of The Lion King as it is probably the best quality release of the original film available, since Disney obviously doesn't care enough to have it optional in their current releases and want it to remain in the past. Disney'schanges to the film may not seem as big compared to the amount of changes George Lucas has made to the Star Wars Trilogy, but they're there (and in my opinion, The Lion King is the most changed out of all the Disney Renaissance films).<br /><br />And Disney: you may try to make people forget about your old 2D logo every time you put that new CGI logo of yours in front of your old films, but some of us still want to watch these movies with the old logo. Just saying.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|Funny poke at the aging of a couple...with way too many scenes that hit too close to home!  We laughed throughout...as most of these things have happened to us...more than once!  Relate-able and silly, you'll enjoy this diversion from your real world.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great romance story. I enjoyed it. It was funny and sweet. It was more of a blush than steam.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love everything about this series. The historical accuracy mirrored in the fictional story. Brilliant! I highly recommend owning it for the great extras.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This was a great gift for my brother. I was not sure what to get him. I think he will enjoy it.
B009653J0S|5.0|From its radical plot shift to its imaginative vampire shifts, this movie keeps the viewer entertained.  It is not great cinematography (nor was meant to be) and part of its goal seems to be to have as many inconsistencies as possible. It would clearly be a funny vampire spoof--except for the exploration of violent psychosis, violence, tragic irony, despair, and profanity (at points of high tension, a sentence of 15 words may have 10 &#34;f words&#34;).
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I rented this movie around 10PM or 11PM- was supposed to be good for 24 hours- however it took 2 hours just to get it to play after setting my laptop on my router to get '1 bar out of 4 connection'. That was amusing.<br /><br />Also upon refreshing the page so many times I discovered my video was only good until 5:45 PM the next day- THAT IS NOT 24 HOURS.<br /><br />WHAT A RIP OFF.
B0040I09RM|5.0|If you're not committed to watching the whole series, don't start! It's addicting! The film quality isn't as good the first season, as it is the rest of the series.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've seen the play with the original cast on Broadway, the concerts on PBS several times, the film in the theater and now on Blue Ray. You might think I like Les Miserable. I do.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|The microphone can hardly pick anything up I had to boost the settings to 90% in windows anything beyond that and it would just have to much static.
072325804X|5.0|The reason I bought this particular edition was because it includes &#34;The Sly Old Cat,&#34; which I've never seen included in any other editions of her Peter Rabbit work. This thick, hardback book has an additional protective case that the book can be slid in and out of. It is heavy and the pages are thick. The feel is elegant and expensive-truly a treasure to be kept and passed down from generation to generation.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The puzzles were great and they give you an opportunity to get past the really difficult ones in a number of ways.<br /><br />However the storyline, even with the twist we didn't expect, is kind of...ugh. But it wasn't bad for the purchase price, especially considering the fact that the graphics were mostly gorgeous. Although, I will say that the animations for the actual people were often creepy to look at . You'd have people talking to you and they'd just look stiff and unnatural and the voice work sometimes seemed to miss the mark. Like they'd say something with a passion and then you'd see the animations and the character speaking would have these emotionless or subdued expressions - no harmony.<br /><br />But I will warn everyone that the &#34;free&#34; portion of the game only takes you up to a certain point. Beyond that you have to pay for the unlocked version.<br /><br />It was a nice little diversion.
B00CHILW64|2.0|You knew from the first moments the entire story.  Save yourself the time I spent. Those are 2 hours I'll never get back.  YAWN.
B002S0KBUY|5.0|Having recently been faced with the prospect of doing PGD due to infertility I was curious to read this book as I hate the term 'designer baby'. Like so much concerning infertility that term is misunderstood. This is not a story of infertility but it is the story of a family faced with impossible choices and gives us a glimpse into what must be the worst pain that any human can suffer. I applaud her for taking on the topic and I am interested to read her other works as I understand that this is a trend in her books.
B0026KZ3T0|5.0|This is one of those movies that someone in the house, and often all of us, will watch once a year. It's one of only three or four that we will watch more than twice. Our late teenagers and ourselves find it funny, clever, original - perfect on one of those nights when you don't want to think about the movie and just enjoy it.
B004UPANGM|3.0|The name implied a lot of violence and terror and although the graphics were okay the darknes was deceiving for my taste.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|(This review is biased by my long-standing admiration for Lee Child's writing and the character of Jack Reacher, as portrayed in the books.)<br /><br />No way does Tom Cruise carry the role of Reacher. I think there was one, 5-second spot in the whole movie, when I thought, yes, that might have been a Reacher expression. Apart from that... no.<br /><br />I cannot believe that anyone who has read the books could ever have thought that Tom Cruise could take this role. Reacher's physical presence is as important as his intelligence, character, and anything else.<br /><br />Lee Child himself would have been better cast in the role. He's the only \\"actor\\" who shines in this entire movie (he has a small cameo role). And as for Ms. Pike's chest... really???? Wouldn't a T-shirt have fitted the role better?
B005C0DHEY|4.0|I changed my mind about fracking after seeing this documentary it really impress me. I would recommend everybody to see it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! Finished this book in less than a day; It was such a page turner! Loved every second of reading it.<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br />I was relieved that my initial thought was wrong and Hope/Sky didn't turn out to be his sister...lol
B004TI5N38|5.0|Haven't read Baldacci in a while because a couple of his past works were beyond bad, I doubt they were even written by him.  He seemed to have taken the James Patterson route, can you say ghost writer?  But he has redeemed himself with this book.  Also, as someone who has read every Jack Reacher novel, I can say that though Baldacci may have had some inspiration from Reacher, he's done a fine job in carving out his own unique character in the form of John Puller.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the series.  My only criticism is that the subtitles for the hearing impaired  are not in sync with the picture.  Other than that it is fabulous
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Well written story.  Gives a new perspective to people who suffer from mental illness.  Highly recommend this book to anyone.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|For quite some time, there has been a debate about William Shakespeare.  No one knows for sure who was this man or what are his origins.  Was he a son of illiterate merchant or a nobleman who lived in Queen Elizabeth I's court?  Many scholars suspect it was the latter and that Shakespeare must have known Latin, Greek and French in order to write his plays that are masterpieces to this day.<br /><br />This film explores the hypothesis that William Shakespeare may have been British aristocrat Edward de Devere, Count of Oxford.  Story includes production of Shakespeare's plays but also court intrigues and political plays during Elizabeth I's reign.  Most wonderful costumes and very talented actors are part of this movie.  Very special treat is that Vanessa Redgrave plays Queen Elizabeth I durin her later part of the reign while her daughter Joely Richardson plays young Queen Elizabeth I. Screenplay for this film is carefully thought out and I enjoyed every moment of the movie.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|i love this app.  it shows everything i need.  I need to do some cleaning out of my blogs i'm reading...but it does what it's supposed to.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Most beautiful and sad movie, ever!  Roberto Begnini is amazing in this part, and adorable in the way he makes a game of everything for his small son.  Everything they do in the work camp earns them points!?  The end result of the game is exciting for his son, but a heartbreaking finale for the movie.  This was probably the 4th time I have seen this and I am sure it will not be the last.  Love it more every time I see it.<br />Highly, highly recommend this!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Almost every night I'm on this app.  Love it.  it's addicting.  I can view my favorites, likes, boards.  Love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its fun....very very very fun....like so fun I died and came back to life to play it kinda of fun......the end
0151003084|5.0|This is a very original and beautifully crafted alphabet book. It is a bit dark, but extremely poetic and playful.<br /><br />My previous roommate had this book for her son, Dylan, and this was one of the kid's favorite books. (He was 3-4 when I lived with them). Dylan always asked his mom to read this book. He preferred it over Dr. Seuss' stories, and I can't blame him. Dr. Seuss sounds silly to me.<br />I think he was fascinated by the subtle darkness and the pretty drawings, but there's more to it. The sentences rhyme beautifully, it's sort of entrancing. He ended up knowing the book by heart and reading along, even before he could read. It was really funny to watch.<br /><br />I understand how parents could feel a bit cautious about introducing the idea of death to their child, but hey, isn't there death in all classic children's tales: The Red Riding Hood, Hop-o'-My-Thumb, and so on?.<br /><br />Anyway, a year after I moved out, I ended up purchasing this book for myself. Sometimes children books are so good you want to keep them as an adult.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love history. I am on my way to being a history teacher and was hoping I would be able to use this video in my classroom. It's just really slow and it is really only about the abolishment of slavery which is great, but was just too slow for my liking. It is also majorly political which I believe isn't always interesting to students.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Love the band and love this album! If you like CCR then this album is a must! Get it now!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was such an enjoyable story to read.  The dialogue was written such that you could just hear the brogue.  The chapters weave the stories of the two main characters together in a way that makes you want to keep reading to find out how they connect.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good game when I got this app but now I'm addicted to it and it's one of the best games  have ever played.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I saw the trailer to this movie on YouTube, and through comments had heard that this was a book series. Now that I have finished it, I am definitely interested in reading the other books, but may I add that I am so bummed out on the plots twist! I am sad on the \\"truths\\" that were told.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|If there's one mainstream artist not risking over saturation it's Justin Timberlake. Having only released three albums in the span of eleven years it's clear that he makes music because he wants to. It's been seven years since we've received his sophomore effort FutureSex/LoveSounds, but after hearing The 20/20 Experience it's clear that Mr. Timberlake hasn't lost his step even after his long break.<br /><br />To be clear, those looking for another Justified or another FutureSex/LoveSounds are going to leave disappointed. He's only three albums deep, but no two albums have sounded the same and The 20/20 Experience is no different. It's very unique, but it still maintains that special something that makes it feel like a Timberlake album. In fact, I think it's become my favorite album of his and I can't seem to stop listening to it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, The 20/20 Experience is a grower. It's not an album that's going to hook you right away and it took a good four or five listens before I truly started to enjoy what I was hearing. Then I found that I was coming back because I wanted to and not because I felt obligated to write this review. That in itself is impressive because usually when I don't like an album after the first two or three listens my opinion remains the same from that point on, but there's just something about this album that I find so fascinating. Even after a dozen listens or so I still can't figure out what it is that's making me so attracted to it.<br /><br />The 20/20 Experience starts off with \\"Pusher Lover Girl\\" which does a nice job of laying the ground work for the album's pretty lengthy hour and ten minute running time. In short, it's about finding that one woman who you find so intoxicating that her love literally feels like a drug. The song also does something that the listener will get to experience quite a few times while listening to this album. It contains an outro, one of the album's best in my opinion, that kind of breaks offfrom the main sound that was present on the song's first four minutes. This outro still continues the song's main theme with Justin singing \\"I'm just a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love.\\"<br /><br />This leads into \\"Suit & Tie\\" which I'm sure everyone has heard already. All I can say about this is Justin apparently hasn't gotten over his need for unnecessary guests. Seriously though, Jay-Z ruins the flow of the entire song which brings it down quite a bit. Then comes \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" which is perhaps one of the most visual songs on the album. By that I mean it's very easy to close your eyes and clearly see everything that's going on. I wouldn't be surprised if this became a single for this album somewhere down the line.<br /><br />After this sexy thriller we get \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" which is the song I constantly found myself conflicted over. I loved the overall tone and the lyrics in the verses and bridge, but the \\"strawberry bubblegum\\" bit in the hook and the extremely corny \\"If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum, then I'll be your blueberry lollipop\\" in the outro kind of killed it for me. It wouldn't be too bad if the outro wasn't there, but, unfortunately, it is.<br /><br />Fast-forward to track seven and we get the extremely smooth \\"That Girl\\". This is the song that stuck out to me the most after my first listen. It has this very old-school 60's vibe that feels beautiful, but manages not to sound outdated. There's not many people who could pull that off, but Justin did. After this comes \\"Let The Groove Get In\\". If there was one song on this album that embodied everything Justin has done in his solo career over these eleven years it would be this one. It's so fun and it somehow feels like it would be a perfect fit on any of his albums.<br /><br />Fast-forward once again and you reach the tenth song, and the album's closer, \\"Blue Ocean\\". Once again we have a very impressive song that is unlike anything we've heard from Timberlake in the past. It's very somber and almost eerie at times. Between the beat and the way Justin delivers his vocals it's bound to send a chill or two down your spine.<br /><br />On top of the ten songs on the main album there is a deluxe edition available which contains two bonus songs, \\"Dress On\\" & \\"Body Count\\". While I personally found the former more enjoyable neither is perfect because, unfortunately, they are both plagued with an unnecessary guest artist. Honestly though if you decide it's not worth the hassle trying to acquire these two songs I wouldn't worry too much because you're not missing out on much. As I said before neither is perfect and they don't really do much to add to the overall experience.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\", \\"Tunnel Vission\\", & \\"That Girl\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.5/10 - Look, The 20/20 Experience is far from perfect. It has some flaws, but overall it's an impressive album from a man who's been silent for seven years. There's no arguing that this a different Justin, but I think it's hard to deny just how comfortable he feels on here. He's no longer doing what everyone else is doing and instead came out with something he wanted to make. He took some risks by switching up his sound once again and having majority of these songs run six to eight minutes, but in my opinion it worked out quite nicely.
0525478817|2.0|This is my first book by John Green and I'm quite disappointed. I knew from the very beginning I wouldn't like it, but I decided to finish it anyway. It's another tear-jerking love story, except I didn't feel like crying at all. I knew from the minute they introduced Hazel and Gus how the plot would play out. The characters are unbelievable - yes, there are smart and witty kids out there, but Hazel and Augustus (what's up with his name, seriously) are so contradictory -  their speech is pretentious all the time, but then there is also an abundance of \\"likes\\" and \\"whatevers\\" (too many if you ask me) that come from Hazel on every page. I'm just tired of all these love stories about awkward underdog girls (who, of course, don't realize they are attractive) meeting a handsome prince who falls in love with them right away -c'mon!!! (Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey had the same story line, right?). Maybe if I was 15 I would have loved this book because it would have made me believe there is a sexy boy with a pretentious name waiting to fall in love with me, but I don't see how an adult can take this seriously.
B008JEJLVS|5.0|He is learning to wear them, much to my surprise.  I am sure he will love these shoes as much as I love mine!
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|this app is ok I guess. the voice is really annoying and flat. it could be useful but it's not as good as it seems. also I can't figure out how to get documents on my kindle to this app. you can't even play with the language!
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in the series, but all the books are amazing. They are my favorite series. THEY ARE AWSOME!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|First of all this is not a feel good kids movie. That in mind, if youve ever owned a teddy bear as a child you'll totally get this movie. Funny all the way through!!! Never knew teddy bears were that dirty minded!!! Great movie, great sgi on the bear, you swear it there and reacting the way it does!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Although some viewers probably thought this movie was sappy and overly sentimental, after living for 68 years, I found the emotional angst that Allie and Noah experienced during the early years of their relationship quite realistic.  The Alzheimer's disease that robbed Allie of her memories was all too real as was the effort through the notebook to remind her of her past.  I did this with my mother.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The detail of history and the way in which it is written make this book a must have for all Lincoln enthusiast. Highly recommend.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I love this cd Paul Anka  is if not the best singer in the world I grew up listening to his music his duet singer make him sound great
B009369Z8A|5.0|I live in the area & was history for me, Great Movie.  I read the book first & the movie was true to the book
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was recommended this book and found it to be a great read, sad in places but a really great story.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|If you like Wes, you won't be disappointed by this.  Sometimes his films seem to lack compelling story lines, but not this.  After watching it, I am back to revisiting his earlier titles.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|OMG!  I love this set!  Hours of behind the scenes info, lots of extra footage, 3 versions of the film... a MUST for any Avatar enthusiast!
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This is definitely required movie library material for any Anthony Hopkins junkie such as myself.  Not into Anthony Hopkins?  Watch this and you will be!  I could just eat him!
B001OGWY1W|3.0|Considering the budget, the starpower and the amount of action in this film - it should be thrilling.<br />I found it to be plodding and lacking in intensity - I had to leave off before the end and I forgot to go back and watch the rest.<br />Even the normally spellbinding Gary Oldman was boring.<br />The only spark of life was Heath Ledger as Joker; I wonder what the film would've been like if it matched the level of engagement to be found in his performance.<br />Maybe for some, all sizzle and no meat is enough but for me, the whole film amounted to - Meh.<br />As Clara Peller so eloquently said many years ago  - &#34;where's the beef&#34;?
B007L3BMGA|3.0|So disappointed with it!  So much hype surrounding this book I thought I would read it - wish I hadn't bothered now.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Was skeptical to buy but wowza it's so fun. Glad I bought it. My 5 year old is addicted too lol.
1423113497|5.0|Exactly as advertised and item was delivered very fast and great quality. Ordered these randomly and I am not much of a reader but turns out to be a fantastic series and I recommend it
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|Lots of others have already done detailed reveiws.  I'll just add that I love this album.  Have listened to it all the way through many times and can't get enough.  If your a fan of gritty, late-night, MIssissippi hole-in-the-wall blues you should buy this album.  I got it on special for $5.00 and I can't imagine a better use of 5 bucks.  Just buy it!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|My boyfriend has been trying to get me to see this movie since it was in theatres but I  didn't think I would like it  and refused to go (typical female, haahaa). Django  turned out to be very entertaining with just the right amount of action and humor. A definite pleasant surprise!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It is nothing different than the web browser running a mobile version. It is teeming with bugs, extremely laggy, rife with inconsistencies.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|I have been collecting for almost a year now and I have to say this is my favorite piece. This is the perfect figure. Loaded with articulation. If you dont even like dragon ball still get it. Its amazing
B007DIQC90|5.0|i can not stop listening to it.  it is playing in my truck non stop!! I highly suggest this album :)
B004U8VWLE|4.0|This is a hard movie to follow at times, but it all comes together at the end. It shows the dark side of being perfect.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I play it over and over and it never gets old.  I would recommend this CD.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Although this series isnt for those with a weak heart, If you cant handle blood then I don't recommend this series.  However, it is a beautiful series and the writing is great!
B008NW67E0|5.0|What a great album.  I really like this one.  I can't stop listening to it.  I plat it over and over again.  LOVE IT!!!
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Great classic sales movie. Anytime you think you have it bad at work, just watch this movie and you'll feel much better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awsome! Now, I'm a kid myself and I love this game. It js amazing!<br /><br />What do I rate this game?<br /><br />100%!
B000FA5STS|5.0|exciting, surprising, good to read about &#34;more mature&#34; people can still have worth to this country.<br />Stimulating...Just enjoyed it tremendously.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I love being the controller of these crazy amazing rides! The rides may be expensive but they are well worth the coins.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Baldacci did a fine job on this story line. Just isn't like all the other thrillers. Never get tired of reading
B0045JEPXK|2.0|Ron<br />Sound quality not good...a little dissapointed... Its not so much the recording ,as she sings so quiet in some places the noise of the crowd drown  her out.. might be better visually on DVD
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My wife is a huge fan of the series,  so I had to gets this as soon as I heard about it.  We had most of the movies on DVD.  Blu Ray is another being entirely,  the picture is awesome,  the sound,  all encompassing.  The way they are meant to be seen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would recommend this for kid of all ages. It is a challenge and it is also FUN and exhilarated to the maximum level.<br />The metal mother frog<br /><br />Metalmom
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|This movie is awesome,  classic troubled bond with a side of honor.  Daniel Craig is by far the best bond since Sean Connery.  And he is astounding in this film.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|When I first heard about this book, I wasn't interested in reading it. Who wants to read a book by a lottery winner on how to pick your numbers? And as charmed as her life sounds from blurbs in the press, reading the book makes it even more amazing. Seriously, she found herself in none of the awful places that so many women in business do. Just one fabulous school and one sensational job offer after another.<br /><br />That being said, the humility she brings to this book is appealing. She knew she'd be a target from every conceivable direction, but she had some things she wanted to say. Much of the book is unsurprising to women her age and above who've taken on the male-oriented business world. But it's not going to hurt anyone and there are moments of inspiration for just about everyone.<br /><br />I think it's a particularly valuable book to give to young women entering the work place. It's tough out there, it's frequently unfair, but if it's your game, you may as well learn how to play it. Someone who's lost a few rounds would undoubtedly have a different perspective, but then cheer leading is better than weeping as the organizing principle of a self-help book.
B001F6TXME|3.0|But it works and easy to use. I guess if everything wasn't cheap plastic I'd be complaining about how heavy everything was.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Great movie, great price.  I collect DVDs and buy them when I find a great deal.  I paid around $5 for this with free shipping.  Can't beat that!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very funny for kids and adults. A bit crude at times but still ok for younger kids. Adults will enjoy for the subtleties
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther keeps you turning the pages as fast as the fingers and eyes can fly.....a timely setting, abundant details of the situation in Yemen , fascinating dialogue as John Corey and his wife face danger and intrigue, the conflicted interplay of CIA, FBI, plus the  powers  in Yemen that bend and  sway as often as a willow in the wind.....all this adds up to another great read from De Mille.<br />Anne O.
B009R659L8|4.0|I have read everything written by Mary Higgins Clark....She always keeps you wanting more.  You can't put it down until you know &#34;who dunnit!!&#34;.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another incredible, thought provoking Albom novel. He writes books that leave you in deep thought long after you read the final sentence and this one is no exception.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Enjoyed the speech and the wholesomeness of it.  I had never read it before now and really liked it.<br />Couldn't put it down.
B00957T6X6|5.0|These books make for a really fun read with non-stop action. I am only on book 3 but I already wish there were more than 5 books.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like the game, but I would rather pay a flat rate for a full version, then have an option to buy stars in order to get access to some items.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I love surfing and the ocean so I liked the movie.  Good footage of waves.  Storyline not as bad as crush.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Good clean fun for the family.  Very exciting and some nice plot turns to keep the viewer interested.  A lot of plusses and very few minuses IMO.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Go log in and buy this now!  Don't think about it make a move.  This is an awesome visual experience.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This provided great information to use in planning a weight loss program. It's simplicity and application made this a great read.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Hero journeys for the younger crowd.  A welcome addition to our children collection.<br />This is not just a visual pleaser but a thought  and ideas provoker.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0142403873|5.0|What a great story the little mouse out smarts even the gruffalo so he wont get eaten.  My grandson loves the story, He had to make a gruffalo cake and go to the web site for activities great fun.  You will have to read it over and over.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|No collection would be complete with adding The Hobbit along with Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />You will watch it many times so it is well worth the expense.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the cat books are addicting, I think we own them all,  my grandson loves them all.  Check out the website for the song. It's great fun. We read them over and over.  He enjoys the song and looking for the bird on every page,  Great story and lesson.  No worries.
B005LAII08|5.0|This sets the standard for all children's films.  It has something for everyone except for the little ones under 7 perhaps.  A new classic in the keeping.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Great songs and very relaxing. I quite often listen to it in my study room when reading or reviewing photos.
B00BHMF578|4.0|watching the back story and details of the Iran escape was chilling and amazing. I enjoyed it and plan to watch it again sometime.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|love this movie and the blu-ray looks amazing! It definitely did the book justice and I love emma watson in it.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like this game, it is very interesting.  But I can say that eating people is mean, eating the animals and fish is what a shark is suppose to do, eating people is a little morbid.  The game is interesting though.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Very intriguing storyline, great acting, well directed.  Highly recommend it!  Matthew McConaughey demonstrates his versatility and talent, and Marissa Tomei was great as supporting actress.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love it because it is so challenging.  I have spread the word and I have other co-workers playing this game as well.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love the show, and I am glad I have the chance to go back and watch the episodes I missed before I started watching the series.  I love the characters, and the storylines are well done.
B0015AARJI|5.0|its a great controller and its just like my other controllers and it works how it should when im playing my different games and im all about the game.great controller.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It is so funny<br /><br />Best book ever lol i liked the part when he got famous and populair at school very funny
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|good performances by the lead actors and supporting; this movie held my interest throughout but was not a &#34;gripping, edge of my seat thriller&#34;
B008AK8FHM|5.0|i am also an MD and trained in the &#34;science&#34; of believe what can be proven. I have seen things that cannot be explained by science happen to children I have cared for. This book reminds us that we cannot explain everything and that we will be &#34;on the other side&#34; someday ourselves. I trust it will be as wonderful as Dr Alexander describes as best he could.
B001AZFO14|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of this movie.  The story could use some work, there are several things they could have explained a bit better, and some things made no sense whatsoever.  If you're looking for a military Sci-fi with not a lot going on, then this is the movie for you.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Just like the characters in the movie, Amelie makes us smile. Wonderful movie. Not much to add to the first 1150 people who reviewed this.
0439023491|5.0|While this is not a great piece of literature, is it a cleverly developed story.  Read in sequence starting with the Hunger Games.
B00C4GRGQY|1.0|This is the second photography related Amherst Publishing e-book I've purchased and in both cases the embedded photographs are fair to poor quality.  I know the photographs themselves aren't the issue as I've also looked at the hardcopy at my local bookstore and they look fine there. It has something to do with the method the publishing company or Amazon is creating the electronic versions of the books. It's a book about photography, the image quality should be stellar and they are not. I also noticed lack of attention to detail in the text where some passages are in one font size then it jumps to something 2-3x the size.  I've written to the publisher and they are looking into the matter with the company that produces the e-book versions.  Amherst Publishing was nice enough to send me a print version instead which I'll post a followup review but so far it's been good stuff except for the images part.  I wouldn't recommend the ebook version of this book until electronic production issues are recified.<br /><br />If I could get my money back I would and turn around and buy the print version instead as the content from Neil is pretty good as always.<br /><br />Go look at the publications from Popular Photography's digital subscription - they do it right with high resolution, crisp images.
0439023513|5.0|While this is not a great piece of literature, is it a cleaverly developed story.  Read in sequence starting with the Hunger Games.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I LOVE this new TV series.  I was turned onto it late so I am having to go back and watch the first season and it is great!  If you have not watch it, and you love the Sherlock Holmes stories, then you will love this show.  Amazon is doing a great job with making this viewing possible.
B005C7MVC6|4.0|The enjoyability factor of Bon Iver comes through in how hushed this album is. The melodies are there,the song structures are fragmented, but ultimately gel and add the body to this ethereal album. Bon Iver also imbues his work with a sense of warmth. The folksy song Towers captures that element nicely. Calgary is just perfect in how it builds strength as it progresses, leading to the climactic angst and fractured quality that Vernon's voice rises to on occasion. On Hinnom, TX, his voice reverberates at his lowest and registers at once,like speech and song combined. Bon Iver takes time to appreciate but should not be dismissed. Complex, angelic, and even slick, absorb it and hear it unfold into one of your favorites.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Just a splendid cast and a faithful translation of the stage production. This is, in my opinion, the best musical ever brought to film.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|If you are ever thinking of becoming a vain person, you need to read this book...and to finish it completely.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|another steven jackson success, although was a little disappointed not being forewarned this was to be played out<br />on multiple discs.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Excellent silly sappy romantic comedy. Great chemistry between the characters, great acting and creative plot. Keeps ya smiling throughout the show.
B009AMANBA|5.0|without question, daniel-day-lewis in my estimation remains one of the premier actors able to completely become<br />the person he portrays. already &#34;lincoln&#34; in my mind is a classic. entire cast selection brands spielberg the best<br />in forming actors to fit the characters.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A friend showed this game to me and I was immediately infected.  I have since watched the spread of this contagion!  Great fun! Absolutely compelling strategic gameplay.
1451695195|5.0|something with substance and meat to back it up. i believe the brain acts as the speaker from the soul. in this case,<br />more like a loudspeaker. well- written. a new way of seeing beyond flesh and blood.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|wish there was a way where if you got to a certain number of points that it got more difficult.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I loved this game, definitely needs more levels, which will come.  This game was the perfect mixture of puzzles and challenge.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awsome i love it many peeps gave it 5 stars but if i could give this here app i would give it 10 stars being the max max
B008Q07U5O|4.0|Jack Nicholson at his best.  Many interesting plot twists and turns.  Demonstrates how evil man can be in pursuit of the almighty dollar.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|I think this movie was so incredibly well done, the cinematography is fantastic and well the story is simply adorable!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pintrest as a creative resource.  I've found great recipes, jewelry tutorials and other fun &amp; creative ideas!!  I enjoy pictures of places I want to travel and unusual ideas.  Pintrest is lots if fun!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked this Nicholas Sparks book because it was darker than the other books he has written but still had the sappy love story that we all love. Great movie as well!!
031620157X|5.0|Chris Colfer is a fantastic storyteller. He is a wonderful actor, but his writing is truly outstanding. This is not just a children's book-- I read this book in less than a day and I am 22. Colfer tells us what happens in the story books while we're not watching. The book is engaging and fascinating, and I recommend it to readers of all ages.
B00480OHWK|5.0|I loved the part when the baby bird gets back in the tree and finds his mother.<br />It was a great book!
B003L77G06|5.0|I didn't watch Modern Family the first two seasons it aired, but as soon as I watched one episode I was hooked. I bought the first two seasons at the same time and watched them both within a week. The second season is my favorite, and I highly, highly recommend it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This was better than I thought it would be. Good story and amazing animation. Calling it animation is not quite accurate since at times I thought is was live action. Thats how visually impressive it was. A wonder to behold in hi-Def. My whole family loved it especially my 9 year old son who watches it over and over again. Highly recommended!!!
0345803493|4.0|This was a great follow-up to the initial book,  a few unexpected twists.  Can't wait for the next series to come out!
B004GHNHVW|4.0|From our finest songwriter and musician, as a forever fan I think this is a good CD, but not the best of his work.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app works great.  I can give the kindle to my 4 and 1 year old and not have to worry about it.  It just brings them back to the app home page if they click any ads or any buying stuff.  It is easy to use for the kids too, to have all their apps in one spot.  I do wish changing the volume was easier though.  There should be an option to have this locked or not.
B00899F0G8|5.0|If you like suspense this is great. Not too intense for children though. My daughter, who is ten, loves it
B003Y059EK|2.0|i thought this movie might be something near an entertaining watch.  boy was i wrong.  this movie is just strange.
075669812X|5.0|My cousin was so excited to get this book! Of all the Ninjago stuff he has this was the one thing he didn't.<br />The font and words were kid friendly for a 10 year old. I highly recommend this book.
B000N90JGI|5.0|watching this movie just makes you feel good. liked the story line and the chemistry between<br />characters was good. good movie to watch when you want to feel better
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I've ever read!  Well written, and amazing, lovable characters.  Made me think about flowers in a whole different manner.
0618477942|4.0|A perfect example of what a graphic novel can do when written for an adult. The graphics give it an almost movie-live quality.
B0072OFM28|5.0|As the title says.<br />But the stupid word count requirement to submit requires i type all these extra words to meet the submission requirement.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|So helpful! A must for all moms, dads, women, men, husbands, wives and also to help work on co-worker relationships. Well worth the time and money.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Well done. Lots of thought provoking ideas. Acting was excellent .  Would watch again as I would write down some of Chris' thoughts.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|You walk right into OCD, a compulsion disorder that can wrap about one so tightly that living normally is impossible.  Into the Darkest Corner takes the reader into the mind of an OCD young woman.  As I read I began to think I had developed OCD to stay with the read until it was finished.  I'm not a fan of the &#34;F&#34; word and this did hinder my complete enjoyment of reading, especially if it comes from a woman.  That is my hang-up and may not bother the average reader. The horror of this woman's life and her final recovery is a lesson in life.  The author makes you feel her pain and compulsions.  I found sympathy for the woman, yet, I wanted to cry out, &#34;hey, you're causing this, stop what you are doing. &#34; I read this on my Kindle Touch and wished I had purchased the book instead.  Either way it will take the reader deep into misery and reward .
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewel is fun and the actual game play is intuitive. You do not need a book of instructions for this game.  The addition of &quot;non-playable&quot; spaces makes the game a lot more interesting and challenging.  An excellent buy for all ages.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Beautiful graphics, very peaceful, and fun for everyone.  This was a spur of the moment download for my kids, and now I am the one who can't put it down.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Tom Hardy's character performance is Flawless! In my opinion acting is judged best in the scenes where an actor is physically present in the scene but says nothing. Even in Hardy's silence he controls the show. In real life Hardy has  a strong British accent....Flawless!
B009AMANBA|4.0|OK BUT! Not up to expectations.I thought it was overhyped.Acting good, but not spectactular.Give it a 4 Star rating anyway
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It works really well for protecting my kindle from possible scratches. The downside is that it gets hot along with my kindle on occasion.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Classic old school - hilarious.  You can watch it a million times and pick up new quotes/scenes every time!  Awesome : )
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Anker is making strides in making quality cell phone accessories.  The car charger is well built and is expected to last for a long time, I wish it came in black though.  I am glad that there's no blinding bright LED, I have another charger that does and it's annoying to drive at night and I also think it's a beacon for car thieves.  There are still minor flaws with the Anker car charger however.<br /><br />First is that the Apple and Android label is printed upside down!  Usually when a USB cable is plugged into a port, the pins would be on the bottom half and the USB port pins are on the top half.  It really bugs me but it doesn't affect functionality.<br /><br />Second is that I did not get a good fit when plugging the charger into my car's cigarette lighter.  There would be no conduction and it wasn't charging so I thought I got a bad unit initially.  I had to jam it in real good for it to work.  It could be my car's fault but I had other USB chargers that fit just fine.<br /><br />Lastly, the charger sticks out like a sore thumb compared to other chargers I've seen that are smaller and nearly flush with the surface, but I can't fault Anker since theirs are capable of charging power hungry tablets which likely requires more hardware to do so.<br /><br />Besides the nit picking, this is a fine quality made charger and would recommend it to those who needs a high amp charger for their tablets.
B002N9MK8G|5.0|WE HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED ALL OF THE SINATRA SONGS AND THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE LIKE THIS ONE CRACKED.
B00CEF014E|5.0|At first I did not enjoy Solstice due to some considerable grammatical errors in the first 2-3 chapters, but as these began to clear up and the story began to take shape it was a thrilling story.  There are so many plot twists that escalate in this book, it will have you guessing until the very end.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The first love story I have read on line. It was laughable at times and serious at other times. I enjoyed reading it.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|It's a classic and perfect for young children.  Definitely G rated and in addition not scary.  A winner!  Kids love the music, too.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This app works well on the kindle.  It is straight forward and a good level of skill. Just plain fun for endless hours. Have fun.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This movie was a good laugh. It is full of hysterical characters, entertaining talent, and awesome one-liners. Worth the rent!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Engaging from beginning to end. Even with the switching of stories back and forth -easy to follow! Pleasantly surprised, this was a wonderful book.
B007C52NY2|5.0|I purchased this series for my 15 year old niece. She loves mysteries. She have not seen the movie to &#34;girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;. She says the books hold her in place reading and wanting to read more and more. I would recommend the set.
B001224WBS|4.0|The price offered for this album made it difficult to pass up. There is only a handful of songs on here that I really like but the value was the sole reason for this particular purchase.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I adore this movie.  It's one of those that you watch once and the watch with one group of friends...and another.  And you just never get tired of watching it.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|A cute app, and it runs well on my Kindle Fire HD. My grandchildren will like it. But I don't use it often because it's only really funny with other people around.
B000002U8A|5.0|Love this disc - a few big hits as well as some lesser known songs that are still great.  Love it.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|This game just would not load onto my Kindle Fire HD. It looked like it might be interesting, but no go. Very disappointed, as I would really have liked to try this game.
1451697686|5.0|This book is great!  I've been following Bea's blog for awhile and was excited to find more ideas in this book.  Bea is a tremendous example of someone committed to saving the planet and she's an inspiration.  I love that I can pick and choose from the multitude of ideas and still have a positive impact.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|It's an okay product, good for when I absolutely need a fact. It loaded well on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0080R3YIU|5.0|I love this book.  Lots of food for thought presented in simple, easy to understand terms.  Great ideas for everyday living.
B004SBX112|5.0|I really love Angry Birds. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD, and the graphics are great. But it's taking me a long time to figure out the strategy of how to get those darned piggies!  I do love it, though.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie has such a great message.  Funny, sad, moving.  Highly recommend seeing this movie. I loved it so much I  bought it!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I don't find much exciting about Linkedin, maybe I just haven't played around with it enough. But the app itself loaded perfectly and works well.
0062082353|5.0|Very well wriitten and once you started you did not want to put it down until you're finished. His honesty and heart  for other really is well displayed in this book.
B001TH16DI|5.0|So glad to see a new collection of Star Trek!  I got to introduce a new generation of my family to the true Star Trek with this collection!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great....love it. Love all the main characters!  We never miss an episode.  Thrilling, unexpected plots with plenty of great acting.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love it and never get tired of watching this musical version,  The music and acting is great.  Worth every penny.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My family and I are big fans of Suzanne Collins and her Hunger Games trilogy. When the first book, Hunger Games, was released in 2008, ever searching for good secondary, pre-adult literature, we found in it a strong, believable young woman to whom our daughters, which at the time were 12 and 15, could relate. The movie has it's weak points, diverges from the story line at times, some of the characters in the movie do not match the book characters, esp. Haymitch - played by Harrelson? just bad!, while Jennifer Lawrence was spot on for the title roll of Katniss Everdeen, but overall keeps the main theme intact. Men and women of all ages will be entertained and find the story engaging.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I hated to end this book. Learned a lot about Yemen in the process.  Hope Nelson follows up so I can find our what really happened to Chet.  I like this author a lot!
B0072OFM28|5.0|GREAT SHOW  Cant wait for season 3  Hurry Up realease  Waiting for Homeland and Walking Dead also see you soon
B0034G4OYK|5.0|It has been great for my kids. It's also been a great show for us parents too. Some funny humor in this kids show.
B009JZWO3I|3.0|the affair between Aleshia and Will is getting a bit old and unrealistic.<br />Could use more lawyering and less personal drama.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is the best. It's easy to use and remembers what you put in. It keeps track of your calculations so you don't have to. I use it a lot when grocery shopping.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Would not work with the card sd slot apple should produce their product in the United States instead of China
B00881PTRC|5.0|My friend and I enjoy word games and this was a fun challenge.  We played part of SAT I words and didn't get hanged though it was close a couple times!  I've been hanged a couple times when playing by myself.  Definitely better as a team!  Thank you for creating this fun game.
B008602KQI|5.0|I noticed only a few things missing from the movie, e.g. the golden cornucopia.  I felt the characters did very well in their roles.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Maggie Smith is so funny.  Just love her quips.  Naturally, was sad with what happened at the end of season 3.  Don't know where they will go with the story now.
0553582461|4.0|Boy, is Robin Hobb good at fanservice! The good kind, not the gratuitous female nudity kind.<br /><br />Although it drags in parts, a lot of this book -mostly the second half- is just filled with squee. Even the ending, if you ship that way. There was a pleasant revist after revisit of old friends, and tying up those loose ends. (bends. lends. rends.)<br /><br />This is probably the best of the Tawny Man part of this story. (I refuse to think of them as separate trilogies.)
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|This is more what I expect when I think of Judge Dredd, as opposed to Sly Stalone's film.  It could have been better, but I think the general acting could have been better.  Still, if you are having an action film day and a beer, it would work.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Great fun, good entertainment that never gets outdated. Who needs 3D? The first installment is the best. Too bad J-2 and 3 aren't as good.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This book was very enjoyable.  It is cliche, with the boy who has a larger-than-life destiny, and does amazing things, ala Belgariad or many others, but still I enjoyed it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|A great app for anyone with kids. They love the animals page and ask to see it every day! Plus, craft ideas are fun and easy to do. Hours of entertainment on a rainy day. We put Pinterest on all our electronics so everyone has their own pages.
B00BESCUKK|2.0|This movie was terrible, but at least terrible in that it was pretty funny at times. All the characters are just silly.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show! I watched all of the 1st and got caught up on the 2nd season in little over a week!
B008B68IV8|5.0|I got it for my neice for her birthday and she loves it! These are great dolls and make great gifts
B009GEDP26|5.0|Castle is a fun, clean, exciting show, in which we still have a hard time figuring out who the killer is!<br />It helps take the place of  &#34;Murder,she wrote&#34;, &#34;Magnum, P.I&#34;, etc.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Not many details were left out of the editorial review; it is one of the best I've ever read. When most other 10 to 14-track albums are $15, this is a steal! Watch an artist go from \\"classic\\" country to \\"contemporary\\" country and \\"rock\\" over 50 years.<br /><br />This is a one-disc 2005 compilation album that attempts to collect Cash's hits from throughout his career. That's much to ask of one CD, but the record label does fit 21 tracks on here in chronological order, beginning in 1955 and ending in 2003. Live, studio, and radio edit versions are all included in this mixed bag. The only track missing by this novice's limited experience is \\"Daddy Played Bass,\\" and that is a huge omission.<br /><br />I'll turn 30 this year, and I came late to Cash, except for the well-known singles, \\"Ring Of Fire\\" and \\"I'll Walk The Line.\\" Ok, we did have an old LP of \\"A Boy Named Sue,\\" which I couldn't resist playing for the funny-factor. I now recall that \\"One Piece At A Time\\" was played on another LP (Must have been my brothers; the song sounds too much like them). I thought for sure that \\"I've Been Everywhere\\" was a much older song (1996).<br /><br />\\"Highwayman\\" is my absolute favorite. Merle Haggard, Kris Kristofferson, and Willie Nelson lend their vocals to this balad of music artistry. You'll find other famous folk on the album, including U2.<br /><br />Tracks that are new to me include \\"Man In Black.\\" It is a faux explanation, but it is classic Cash. \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is one I may have heard, but because Cash aged so much, I never would have contributed this to him. It is great country-gospel! \\"Hurt\\" is very intense and emotional Cash. I would classify this as rock, not country.<br /><br />You may also enjoy these albums:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002OLP Walls Can Fall]]<br />By George Jones<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MGTFDA Super Hits]]<br />By Willie Nelson<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0032ZNXYK Billboard #1s: Classic Country]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002NVT Patsy Cline - 12 Greatest Hits]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009I7O2U John Denver's Greatest Hits]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009I7O2U John Denver's Greatest Hits]]
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you have not seen this then it is worth your time. I think they did a great job with it.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|forget what these others say - its entertaining, has some laughs and its like a<br />continuation of mib1.  you cant go into these type movies and expect oscar stuff.<br />they are fun and above B level movies.<br />I gave 5 stars since I like it and will watch it again.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This app does not really play well on an Android although it is supposed to.  Rovio was no help at all and called my Android a &#34;cheaper one&#34;.  Thanks guys.  We all make a $1,000,000 a year and can buy the best.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This graphics are beautiful and the ability to travel between world's is seamless. The game doesn't run exactly like Temple Run and I found the usage of coins and abilities a bit confusing , but I still adore this app and I am glad I purchased it.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The acting really made the movie for me.  Danial Day-Lewis and Sally Fields REALLY became Abraham & Mary.  I really enjoyed the film.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Good old movie. I enjoyed watching it. Big time stars from the golden age of movie making. A Hitchcock classic that the whole family will like.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|The movie gave just enough information in a scifi to keep me interested in the back story. Professionally filmed and written.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I didn't expect to like this film since I've disliked Bradley Cooper's past roles and because the script sounded shallow and formulaic. Initially, I thought they'd included De Niro as a come-on. In fact, the only reason I saw the film was because of Jennifer Lawrence, whose sophisticated performance in WINTER'S BONE convinced me I'd seen the breakthrough of a gifted actress.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong about Cooper, wrong about De Niro's inclusion, wrong about a formulaic script, and dead-on about Jennifer Lawrence.  Simply stated, this quirky, brilliant story of the evolution of love between two world-worn, emotionally troubled people -- against the chaotic background of family madness -- was one of the most satisfying, funny and affecting movies I've seen in recent years. In terms of clarity, continuity and heart, it surpasses the book on which it was based.<br /><br />Since others have described the plot on this page, I will say that millions of viewers who have not seen the film will find parts of their emotional lives in the trials of the lead characters. They will marvel at Bradley Cooper's jaw-dropping portrayal of of a man shackled by the manic phase of bipolar disorder. They will wince at those moments in which the love between the principals starts to emerge, and falters. They will discover a performance by Lawrence that is comfortably sensual, and an actress who is equally powerful whether she is mute or screaming.<br /><br />The script is complex and masterfully written, with surprising outburst of pathos and hilarity. The climax of the film -- and I won't enter a spoiler here -- caught me by surprise.  I wept at the beauty of it, the director's mastery of realism, and the restoration of originality and complexity to American comedy.<br /><br />It may be that we're all fundamentally \\"crazy\\" and that these two lovers legitimize the chaos we feel inside.  It may also be that the art direction, score, supporting performances (De Niro is simply wonderful) and choreography are jaw-dropping.  In the end, it's the confluence of so many virtues that make this film as fine as it is. For Bradley Cooper, it's a career-defining moment  For Jennifer Lawrence, it's confirmation of what the wise always believed, and hopefully she'll be spared casting in horror films in perpetuity. She is one of our very best, and her beauty, grace and innate power to inhabit the souls of her characters -- are most unusual.<br /><br />While I've enjoyed it once, I plan to view it again tomorrow evening, will continue to discuss it with friends, and add it to my list of favorites.<br /><br />That's not bad at all.<br /><br />SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is a gift.  Prepare to receive it because it delivers.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app it has everything I want to make a collage,Draw, or edit my photo all people of Amazon get this app it's like instagram.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|love this app. its like a second, more reliable memory. get it! its free and so easy to use. love the versitility of having it on my my phone, tablet, and computor.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another great by Jodi Picoult! She creatively touches sensitive issues like teen suicide. I can never seem to put her books down once I start them and this was no different.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is a good one to watch as a family. It has wonderful moral and appeals to kids in a good way.
1400052181|5.0|Every woman in USA should read this book, to avoid the questionable past repeating it self.  And to learn how women are used as lab rat, but never considered with funding and grants.
B002OT731E|5.0|Fantastic album. Crisp and clean redo of some of their greatest hits. I love these more accoustic oriented versions. This band getting better with age. Sound quality is great if listened to on a good stereo system.<br /><br />You gotta get it
B008BM9L72|3.0|The First book was different and very entertaining. I HAD to read the second and then third to find out WHY the Grey character was like he was. But never found a plausible satisfyingly convincing explanation. What had seemed so exciting and entertaining in the first book became boring and much of a muchness in the second and third. Shame.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|This book was light years ahead of Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus! If gives you practical advice on<br />how to satisfy you/and your significant other's empty love tank.  You'll have to read it to find out the details.  Excellent price. Easy reading, and how you can apply the Five Love Languages to your relationship.  Kudos to Gary D. Chapman!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Terms of Use is too long. File is too big. Not so much about weather as about getting ads in front of my eyes. There's better.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Predictable book, but it was like watching a tv show.  Could just sit back and take it in, and not worry about being stressed.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|History channel gone bad... it was way to long. I love the story, I love the guy but the movie was unbearable and boring.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It was an easy book to get through on the plane, but other than that it wasn't great.  The writing was child like.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent, interesting story line that seems to very closely parallel the history of the time.  Well developed fictional characters with the added advantage of having them interacting with actual historical persons of the era.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It's okay for a connector. Hope it last longer than the original that came with my Kindle. I do not have Fire kindle.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|It was an easy read and engaging.  but it seems that every Nick Sparks book has the same basic format even though it promised a unique conclusion.  Good escapism though.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|im a horror movie fanatic , and have been dying to see this movie! It was well worth the wait and would definitely recommend this movie to anyone!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|the book was very engaging.  it was hard to put down.  The book had a more realistic ending than the movie.  Read it.  You will enjoy it.
0062082353|5.0|I enjoy military books and this was a great one.  I really appreciate Chris and his wife getting so personal with his audience.  RIP Chris
B0017SWPXY|5.0|We had two copies of this book and could not find either so we got a Kindle edition to enjoy any time we like.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Wonderfully made film, very moving and heartfelt. Made sure I don't want to go on any trips anytime soon but really amazing movie. Also great acting, I could never have survived anything like that.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Emotional rollercoaster. I can't wait to read the next one. It is time . ..
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I highly recommend this album, especially to those who enjoyed Tron: Legacy's. It has the same electronic feel, while being more organic (i.e., not as much electronic sounds).
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This books captures the struggles that mark the lives of afghan women. Instead of perishing they instead vow to make meaningful changes or impact the community in some way
B00417HV14|5.0|Excellent blu-ray.  The video and the sound are great.  Joe's more recent blu-ray at the Beacon Theater is a little better, but this one is just fine too.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Not as in love with this album as I have been with the past.. but still very good and worth the money. Bought this through pre-order on amazon and got it at my house on the release date . Happy happy happy.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This set of blu-rays is really good.  The soundtrack for car chases is really dynamic and the plots are engaging.  Definitely worth the price.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Great movie  to watch, many interesting points are brought out, rethink history a bit..I will watch this over and over...
B008Y73940|5.0|Great acting.  Great Plot.  Intelligent writing.  I really liked it.  I've seen it before and still didn't mind watching it again.
B00BQHA06A|4.0|4 1/4 Stars for this bad boy. First off, they couldn't have started the album any better with \\"Unleash the Red\\". This intro is perfection.<br />\\"All Lips go Blue\\" continues their trend of albums with heart pumping 1st tracks. The song really sets the tone and gets you excited for the entirety of the album. Great lyrics, superb guitar solo from 2:20 to 2:45.<br />\\"Love Without Tears\\" has a beautiful chorus.<br />\\"I will be the End of You\\" really grows on you. Give it a few listens.<br />\\"Tears on Tape\\" is one of the best tracks. Its very catchy.<br />\\"Into the Night\\" reminds me of something on Screamworks or Dark light. Good song.<br />\\"Hearts at War\\" is solid. Maybe the best lyrics on the album.<br />\\"No Love\\" is another one that grows on you.<br />\\"Drawn & Quartered\\" hasn't hit me yet. Not really digging it, but that could change.<br />\\"Lucifers Chorale\\" is heavy. Great intermission. Sounds like it could fit right in with greatest lovesongs vol. 666<br />\\"W.L.S.T.D.\\" in my opinion is the best song on the album. Doom metal at its finest. A feel of desperation. Ville shreds the mic with his piercing vocals.<br /><br />All in all, its a damn good outing for HIM. Its better than \\"Screamworks\\" (Even though I thought screamworks was better than most HIM fans give it credit for....yes Screamworks is the most pop HIM album there is but its still HIM) Tears on Tape is not as good as Deep Shadows, Greatest Lovesongs, Love Metal, Razorblade Romance or Venus Doom...but better than Dark Light and Screamworks.
B004742Y68|4.0|It's a classic 70s horror flick.  The special effects were great at the time, but are pretty dated when you look at it now.  It's a lot of fun to go back and watch the oldies.
B00C4QPYJU|3.0|Takes me back to when I was young, and to what we thought then was great cinema. Love the 80's.
034580404X|5.0|Still reading these books.  Good story line.  I can not wait to finish.  Would like to see the movie if it comes out.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this reminds me of the old Gorilla basic game that came with windows 95. simple graphics and kinestetics (physics?)<br />but it actually trains you to get better at planning and trial and error strategies. or you can just mindlessly shoot the birds and enjoy the sounds they make as they fly and land like a cartoon chicken farm.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My kids kept pressuring me to watch the movie, and I avoided it for a while thinking it was just another dumb animated movie. But NO! This movie is laugh out loud funny in so many parts, and the redemption of the lead character into a loving father was a joy to watch. Just saw the trailer for Despicable Me 2 and I can't wait to see it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I enjoy the variety of having a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy disk set.  You can't go wrong with this setup, and the boxes store more easily.  This particular Bond film has been my favorite so far.  I know many will dissagree.
B005LAIISA|4.0|These movies are going to turn into the Land Before Time of the new generation, with sequels galore to their claim, but the writers seem to do a fine job keeping the dialogue fresh and the laughs coming, so as long as that can continue, keep the sequels coming.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everyone I knew was talking about Downton Abbey and how good it was and I wasn't disappointed. Can't wait for Season 3
1476715904|3.0|I feel the cause for my bland reaction to the book isn't so much about the story itself, rather maybe I'm outgrowing the genre. It is actually kind of depressing in a way, because I've become cynical enough to sneer at teen romance, which is probably the most beautiful kind of all.<br />This book was horribly depressing too, so despite finding the heroine off-putting with immaturity (not unlike real teenagers) I was gripped with some kind of emotion the whole time. It was heavy for a YA book, forcing the reader to consider some very sensitive and taboo situations.<br />The most difficult thing for me in a book is when I am supposed to just trust that two people met, and without explanation were in love. Even in indescribable moments of lust, please show me a heroine that isn't just loved for no reason. Let me see that she has a personality! Not an uptight girl whose best friend has all the spunk.<br />I must give the author credit, at least for her own personality. She kept clever and realistic dialogue between the characters so I was able to easily like most of them. It was all a little too reflective of what the author herself might like; the Avett Brothers obesession revealed itself frequently even though they had little to do with the \\"subject matter.\\" That's ok, I'm a fan, too.<br />All in all, I can overlook the rather expected outcome, but I still craved the intimacy in the end that had initially propelled this reader into yet another adorable, tragic, depressing, confusing and touching story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very fun game and as soon as a mission is complete, the new one is given..so it keeps you entertained instead of just being a basic runner
1439127727|5.0|It was quite interesting to read all the back door things that go on between the different presidents.  It is a real eye opener -  especially since I remember many of the things they are discussing.  Anyone who likes history should read this.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book has literally made me laugh out loud and want scream at certain characters.. It's another great Sophie Kinsella book!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|The book was not as funny as some I have read but it was, at times, a touching story of the author and her family.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|I love Debbie Macomber's books.......nice, clean, simple stories:)  I am hoping to read all of her books sooner or later.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|Both Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman are accomplished, funny, competent writers who never fail to please.  Pratchett's fun-with-footnotes attribute always adds a dimension and both enjoy taking an odd perspective on the supernatural.  Particularly interesting is that this book is an early one for both of them, yet is surprisingly mature.  The devil-and-angel story mechanism provides a unique way of telling the story.  Recommended.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Its so rare for a movie to have great scenery, a good story, and whos metaphors are so powerful. Its like a teen version of Tom Hank's movie Castaway.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The sound quality was simply amazing and it was comfortable as heck. I would recommend this to anyone who listens to quite a bit of music. Can't find any problems at all with it!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Rented this in HD for family movie night. Kids loved the story and so did I. HD picture was perfect and no issues with buffering. Recommend!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is so hard to review because no words I can use to describe the book will do justice to this absolutely beautiful book. The world created by the author is so unique and detailed that after I finished the book, I missed it like I had physically been there and enjoyed the circus. It is as if the circus really exists and the stories became part of my memories. I think the best word to describe the book is enchanting.<br /><br />Needless to say, I loved this book. I loved the magic and every one of the characters. The story and the characters were so complex and carefully thought out and described. It was so easy to get lost in the book, have no idea how many pages I had just read, and feel like I had been magically transported to another place. This book instantly made it into my top five favorite books of all time.<br /><br />If you are looking for a beautiful and magical book, look no further. I cannot wait to read it again and again, so that I may live in a dream like the rêveurs.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|Was soooo excited for this album, it was well worth the wait.  Similar sound to Screamworks.  Love, Love, Love HIM!!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Clancy has again delved into the situation of world disorder and how critical the consequences can be for the United States if our government doesn't do it's Constitutional duty to protect and defend the United States.  Cyber attacks are out there just waiting to happen and the damage that can be done is still largely unknown.  The untended consequenses of our dependency on computers and computer operated electrical grid is scary.  If nothing else this book should awaken the citizens of the USA about the dangers facing us.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This was a great book. It kept me interested from the beginning. The characters were intriguing and likable.<br />You will enjoy.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent as Lincoln. Sally Fields as Mrs. Lincoln was also and excellent choice. This movie also showed a side of Lincoln not found in history books -- his sense of humor.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you have ever wondered, \\"What if...\\" or thought you could change history by your behavior, 11/22/63 will captivate your imagination.  Stephen King seasons the ghoulish goulash of conspiracy theories with a tale that makes the after-taste of that day almost palatable.  Few novels will change your perspective as this one does.  You will know, after reading it, to be aware of men with yellow cards.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I saw this movie several weeks ago in a theatre n knew when I would have to purchase it when it came out in a DVD format. It's the most amazing, well performed, n narrated movie; with history that I know I will watch it over again often. The cost from Amazon was great!
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Get some. Entertaining and fun with a little bit of faces being blown off. Worth a rental for sure. Watch it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Fun movie, if you liked Inglorious Bastards, than you will like this. The acting is great, perfect amount of Campy  humor make this a great take on a western.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My husband and I have used this app every night since downloading it months ago!  We both highly recommend it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Just a smarter version of monk. Loved every moment of it! Nice thriller....yet another brilliant series from bbc, oh geee what else do i write?!!! Just watch it already!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a awesome book I like all most as much as Percy Jackson I read I think 8 in two days!!!I finished this book in,ONe day it's epic!!!as the title says please read and enjoy THE Hunger Games<br />My the odds ever be in your hands!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest so many ideas on this site that will keep me busy for awhile. Also great recipes that I have tried multiple times and always comes out great!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is not an easy game but it can draw you into it's web ! You really have to plan ahead to win.
B00BF11STU|4.0|great watch - couldnt stop once we put it on. very realistic and intriguing even though you already know what the end will be.
B009CG8EOM|5.0|Worth buying, but scared me so keep small kids away unless they can handle this, just great spooky special FX
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Great read.  I'm familiar with the area that the story takes place so, for me it was like I was there.  Very well written.  When you get to the middle that's when it really grabs you.  Really enjoyed it
1909313033|5.0|A client knew that I had a soft spot for pugs (I have three) so she picked up this book for me.  Gemma Correll is fabulous, and captures the pug personality splendidly.  I tracked Correll down, and hope to see her exhibit in Toronto this weekend.  Her drawings are too precious.  Not only will you be addicted to pugs, you will now be addicted to Correll's delightful illustrations of these beings.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Bought it for my husband for his birthday and I'm glad because I like it as much as he does.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Good show, it is amazing but I truly believe people are like what the shows protrays of cultic life styles. Boston is just a reminder how weak people minds are to do wicked things to good people.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Had to buy the series since got hooked watching it on regular tv. Wonderfully funny show that I can watch whenever I want now.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched all the previous seasons on Hulu+. I looked on the internet and found that Amazon was now in control of distribution of the series. I thought that is great because I am a member of Amazon Prime. I go to the site and to my astonishment I find that I now have to pay for the privilege of watching the show. I know that it is only 1.99 per episode, but that is the same price as non Amazon Prime members. Seasons 1 and 2 are free to stream but 1.99 to down load and watch while off line. As of 05/01/2013 you can not stream Downton Abbey Season 3.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|An interesting premise with well written characters kept me involved and engaged.  I will look for other works by the author.

B00AYM6JFO|3.0|Willie Nelson sang from the Great American Songbook as early as 1976's [[ASIN:B0000DELVI The Sound in Your Mind]], and with 1978's [[ASIN:B0000296J3 Stardust]] he demonstrated a unique affinity for pop standards. He continued to draw on this material for decades to come, including 1981's [[ASIN:B0012GMYYG Over the Rainbow]], 1983's [[ASIN:B0000025XU Without a Song]] and 1988's [[ASIN:B0012GN3VE What a Wonderful World]]. His latest collection of pop and country standards is a low-key affair without backing vocals or orchestrations, leaving Nelson's voice isolated out front of his Family band. His idiosyncratic phrasing continues to serve this type of material wonderfully, but unlike the statement of Stardust, this set is more of a Saturday night jam than a staged performance. With his sister Bobbie and longtime compadres Mickey Raphael and Paul English on board, the sessions feel as if Nelson's calling out favorites for the group to pick up. The players slide easily into familiar songs, and though the solos can be tentative, the warmth these musicians share, Nelson's deep feeling for the material and his inimitable singing are all worth hearing.<br /><br />Nelson's recorded many of these songs before, a few several times over. He waxed \\"You'll Never Know\\" in 1983 and again in 1994, but this third time he shares the stage more fully with the piano accompaniment. His original \\"Is the Better Part Over\\" is stripped of the strings heard on 1989's [[ASIN:B0000026RO A Horse Called Music]], and though nominally about a relationship that's run it's course, at age 79, one can hear Nelson singing about his life. \\"Vous Et Moi\\" digs more deeply into the percussiveness of Nelson's guitar strings than the 1999 version heard on [[ASIN:B00000JJWB Night and Day]], and \\"Twilight Time\\" is sung in a lower, less-nasal register than his earlier version. Floyd Tillman's oft-recorded \\"I'll Keep on Loving You\\" provides a gentle western swing, and Carl Perkins' \\"Matchbox,\\" which might seem an odd companion here, fits nicely as semi-acoustic, bluesy rock 'n' roll. Nelson greets these songs like old friends, but with renewed enthusiasm each time they meet. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

0451169514|4.0|I only read this tome because, for years and years, my high school English students kept recommending it to me, telling me that King's classic horror novel was really a fun read. So I finally got around to reading the book. What a pleasant surprise. My students were right. It really is a fun read. The plot involves seven kids who battle a shape changing monster in the 1950s and then are summoned back to their hometown of Derry, Maine in the 1980s to finish the job.<br /><br />The book is full of frightening, sometimes gory scenes, but they all struck me as echoing 1950s horror movies. Scary but not really. Along the way King touches on some serious issues like bullying, domestic violence and the idea that you can't go home again even though we all try in one way or another. I actually found some of the passages toward the end of the novel about how childhood memories fade to be really moving and well written. Plus I loved King's use of fifties pop culture.<br /><br />It's a long book and some of it is a bit repetitive and I wasn't crazy about naming the three main characters Bill, Ben and Bev, which I found to be too similar. But all in all, I really enjoyed the book and would like to say thanks to all my students over the years who recommended IT. You guys were right on the money.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Wow! Rick put all his energy in this book!<br />Amazing storyline with such detail you feel as if you are in Egypt.
B0033AI4PM|2.0|Yes, the audio and video are pristine.  Other than that, there is absolutely nothing new about this disc.  In fact, the previous DVD release was, in some ways, better.  At least that contained trailers that related to Streisand films (even though the FUNNY GIRL trailer was not included).  This Blu-ray features two previews for recent theatrical releases that have absolutely NOTHING to do w/Streisand or musicals.  The scene selections in the original DVD included a \\"song selection\\" option, cutting you straight to the musical numbers.  Whoever designed the bizarre chapter spacing for the Blu-ray has no idea whatsoever what this film is about.  You only get around 10 or so stops and you have to scroll through chunks of the film before you get to the opening credits, \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\", \\"My Man\\"....it's awful.  Blu-ray is NOT DVD 2.0!!<br /><br />I simply don't understand why Sony Columbia is giving an A-list release such crappy C-list treatment.  FUNNY GIRL is one of the most successful films Columbia ever made, a huge box office hit in 1968-69.  It is arguably the best and most important film in Streisand's career.  Even many of her detractors applaud her tour de force performance here, to say nothing of the gorgeous artistic support provided for her spectacular film debut.  And yet other lesser films in the Streisand canon (such as the Warner Bros movies) have piled on the extras, including commentary from the lady herself.  Even the HELLO, DOLLY! Blu-ray has a new documentary featuring Gene Kelly's wife and a couple of theatrical trailers.  We know that the deleted footage from Swan Lake and other scenes is out there.  Why wasn't it included in the Blu-ray?  Where's the original theatrical trailer?  Where's the commentary?!  Isn't there a respected film historian in the industry who has something say about this movie?!  This film is begging for the Special Edition package.<br /><br />Get it for the brilliant transfer.  Don't expect anything else.
B004LROUNG|5.0|First book I have read from this author and I will be reading more. He has believable story lines with great characters and keeps the reader engaged throughout without blood guts and gore. Excellent cerebral candy!
B00A83075M|5.0|This movie is great for kids, with a cute storyline and great characters, but adults who remember feeding quarters into games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Q-Bert at the local arcade in the early 80s will love the nostalgia too!
B003B02O14|5.0|Great read! Characters were bondable, pacing was perfect and the story was intriguing. I am picking up more of his work.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I didn't think I was going to care much for this movie, being about teenagers and all ... Instead I fell in love with it and found myself, even at 35 years old, relating like crazy left and right. And I cried. It's an amazing movie. Buy it ... And if you can't buy it, then at the very least rent or borrow it. Especially if you're the parent of a teenager (or, God forbid, more than one). I never in my life thought a movie could be better than a book until I watched this one.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The telling of this story is refreshing and the ending is haunting. No spoilers in this one but even if you aren't a crime reader, this is a great book. It is the story of a father, a son and a mother with their community in the midst of a tragic event ... I will be giving this one for presents to all of my reading friends.
B00985E3UG|4.0|...for crap. Unfortunately, there is crap in every processed food there is: added salt, added fat and added sugar. Even he sugar-free stuff is deadly. The companies don't care, and the government is in the business of subsidizing them. Better grab the wheel yourself!
0062127241|5.0|This book was a gift for my father for his birthday.  He truly enjoyed it.  The inside cover alone was worth the purchase.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|It boggles the mind that the &#34;Little Mermaid&#34; and &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34; team brought us this long-running off-Broadway play and movie.  Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are both outstanding (and Bill Murray is at his creepy best), and the &#34;Greek chorus&#34; is wonderful.  If you like musical theater and have a warped sense of humor, you'll love this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is awesome its so great<br />here's some words of advice<br />DONT EVER DOWNLOAD IFUNNY ITS INAPPROPRIATE<br />ITS DISTURBING TO ME
B009AMANH4|3.0|Good movie,but a little boring.but that's life,life is not an action movie, the way government works sometimes I wonder how they get things done.
0553801473|5.0|I love this series in general (who doesn't), though the last book in the series (A Feast for Crows) was frustrating in many places. This is one of the best of the lot -- definitely the most satisfying read I've found in a while!
B001EBWING|5.0|Casablanca! A film with an unlikely cast which magically came together in this story! The memories of it have lingered with me so that I KNOW it is a classic, by any standards!
B00BF123WG|3.0|I expected more out of this movie.  I thought there would be more action. Seal Team Six - The Hunt for Osama Bin Laden was a better movie if you want action.
B00785P2QC|4.0|very entertaining,  I think it has great graphics, very easy to play. You can let your imagination go. better than Sims games.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The Bone Bed is well written and I feel one of Patricia Cornwell's better books.<br />In this one she kept the technical computer information to a minimum.<br />However, she flashes back to previous books quit a bit in this book.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This story was completely engaging, delightful and funny.  Simsion was able to nestle complex social and personal issues into some heart warming characters to show how social norms often deny characters and personalities of freedom and fulfilment.  A fantastic read!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|very informative and easy to understand. I got a lot of good information that I used to help me create the kindle version of my book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hugh Howey has a vivid imagination and wrote this series of 8 books  in the Silo Series (Wool 1-5 and parts 6-8) with enough twists and turns and suspenseful action along with complicated interesting characters to keep me reading and waiting for book 9.
B005DC68NI|5.0|If you have to choose only one book that will explain why you should go to digital self-publishing, how to do it and also share success stories of other authors, this is the only book that you need to buy.
B003JTHWPA|5.0|We read this for the book club and I hadn't read it in many years. The relationships that Singer had with the various people in his life were poignant. For all that the characters believed him to be in tune with their longings and beliefs, he was more an outsider than any of them knew.
0385349947|5.0|In the future there will be no female leaders.  There will just be leaders, says Sheryl.  Even though legally women have the right to do and be the same as men, there are still barriers.  Sheryl talks about these barriers that we, including her, sometimes don't see.  When senior women leaders openly address these issues, it creates greater opportunities for everyone.<br /><br />Here are a few of her many messages:<br /><br />Don't enter the workforce with your exit strategy planned, instead accelerate.  Keep your foot on the pedal until a decision must be made.<br /><br />Communication works best when we combine appropriateness with authenticity where opinions are not brutally honest but delicately honest.<br /><br />This would be a better world if half our companies were run by woman and half our homes were run by men.<br /><br />Here are some of her personal stories:<br /><br />When Sheryl was a young intern and first met the speaker of the house, Tip O'Neil he asked her if she was a pompom girl.  She recognizes Tip was of a different generation and meekly answered no.  Today she would reply respectfully and confidently in situations like this.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg teaches her kids to sword fight.  Kids of working parents have different experiences and memories; neither is right or wrong, just different.<br /><br />She has started the conversation which has generated lots of press.  The majority of the negatives press makes me believe they have NOT read the book.  Read the book and create your own opinion.<br /><br />Personally her experiences were similar to mine as a woman in a male dominated industry, though I never reached the same level of seniority or had the same background.  I dropped out of the corporate world over 15 years ago to start my own company to have more balance in my life.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Despite the fact that I was in tears for at least 2/3 of this movie, I loved it.  It was so well crafted.  I could only imagine the agony of two parents, literally torn from their children.  It was gut wrenching and put the entire event in perspective for me.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I love this book.  Easy read and great stories from the life of Pete Townsend.  Fun and told by the man himself.
B008602KQI|5.0|Viewing this movie left me anxious for Part II.  After reading the Hunger Games Trilogy on Kindle, I was skeptical that the movie would do the book any justice.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The move was pretty good and the actors portrayed their characters perfectly.  The movie was made even better by viewing from Amazon on my iPad as the streaming was flawless and uninterrupted, unlike some other streaming services that I've used.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Great product. Affordable and a great watch. No glitches in the playback. Have been watching it non stop since it came in the mail.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|No doubt.  This is a wonderful film with excellent casting. Troubled father/daughter relationship that proves, to a large extent, it doesn't matter.  You love each other anyway. Justin was a surprise, really good in this.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|its a lot of fun and has ger cute graphics my daughter loves to play it and she is always asking to play it
B005NFVZTM|5.0|From start to finish I was glued to this movie!  Great action, adventure, explanation.  Even the &#34;walk on&#34; by Wolverine.  Does of good job of explaining the movies already done, kind of knitting the whole storyline together.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|The characters and their development were superb. I actually liked it being subtitled. I  was totally absorbed into this movie. Warning if you don't like black and white movies that are subtitled. this movie is not for you.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|Wonderful, sweet movie. Great music/soundtrack! Sit back with a cup of tea, relax and watch it, then go buy the music. That's what I did.
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|I know a lot of people like this game, but it bored the daylight's out of me. It's just not my thing.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Very funny.  I am typing this review on my phone at work, so it will be short. This show is fun for all ages.
B00683JLXA|1.0|Once you have a 'throw rocks at stuff' game, how many more do we really need? Let me answer that; NONE!!  Once I saw what it was, it was promptly uninstalled.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a touching book, look for the longing hearts of children denied tenderness in families and less fortunate situations.  The author has developed a look at past and present doubts we all have in each of us.  And what a kind or grateful word can do to help another.  Quite tender, worth your time and contemplation.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|I tried the free version of this app for a while, but initially chose Tiny Cam Pro because of the better control layout. I also didn't like the 'out of shape' picture you get when you only have six cameras on the screen. That made me worry a bit about buying the paid version. After using Tiny Cam Pro for about a year, it started locking up my Kindle Fire to the point I had to plug/unplug the power cable and do a hard reset just to get it working again. That developer was absolutely no help and didn't care about the problem. So I went ahead and bought the full version so I could watch all ten of my cameras. Once the page is filled with cameras, the pictures are no longer out of shape so that was a relief.<br /><br />Now for those of you who say you can't get it working, have you set the port forwarding in the router's settings? you might also have to reset the port number so it doesn't conflict with another device. You can use the actual ip address but you won't be able to view away from home unless you use the external ip which can be found in the router's general info page, or by typing 'what is my ip' in a browser.<br /><br />Two last things about the comments. while some people appreciate knowing the Play Store has this or that, please note that Amazon (being the greedy control freaks they are) does not allow Kindle owners to shop at other online appstores. Our devices are locked. And for those of you who have a kindle Fire that has no camera, NO, this app does not magically give you the capability to take pictures. I've seen so many bad reviews for ip cam apps from people who think it will somehow install a camera in their device I wonder sometimes how it can be these people have made it this far through life. So if you're not sure what an app does, don't buy it. But if you make that kind of dumb mistake, keep your comments to yourself.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Was written in a stream of consciousness style of writing that I really enjoyed. It gave me a good sense of characters and their feelings. I also saw the movie, and liked the drama and twists of the movie a bit better than the book. But, still a good book.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game has a glitch that I accidentally encountered that ruined the gameplay experience for me. Also, many of the achievements are not very accomplishable unless you make this game a long-term game to play.<br />(Spoiler Alert)<br />Back to the glitch, you can 'complete' every mission available for Nemo and the other individual characters on the left hand side instantaneously. When being given the mission details, click on the image of that fish on the bottom left corner and viola! It's completed whether you accomplished it in your game or not. I assume the version of my game is up to date so this may not just be an occurrence uniquely achievable on my device.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great App. Unlockable content, great repeatability, excellent science behind the fun.  Can not wait to see what else is in store for upcoming updates.
