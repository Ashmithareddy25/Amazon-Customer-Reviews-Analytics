B000089CKH|5.0|Nada Surf's &quot;Let Go&quot; is without a doubt, a good listen.  A good chill album that is perfect for either wasting away a dreary rainy day listening to, or for throwin into your dash during a road trip.  In my opinion, Nada Surf is a highly underrated band that deserves more acclaim &amp; attention than they are receiving.  I very much look forward to their next release.
0446677450|5.0|This book is about strategy, not tactics. Here you will start to learn how the rich think. This book changed my life as it was the first book of my new living! It's not going to teach you the exact tactics the rich use (try the new van tharp's book for that) but more important it will teach you the thinking behind what they do. Don't mind the bad reviews. It worked for me.
0743424425|5.0|Over 25 years after it was published, \\"The Shining\\" remains ones of King's best novels to date. It is not simply the story of a supernatural hotel, but also the all-too-normal corruption and degradation that can exist within the human heart.<br />Jack Torrance is a deeply-flawed man, both as a husband and a father, and when the evil presence in the Overlook Hotel finds him, it exploits his every weakness. \\"The Shining\\" is a gripping book, and it is one of the few books of King's that I would say is truly frightening. King captures his characters here with a sharp eye for detail, and tells a powerful story.<br />This book has suffered not one, but two adaptations to screen (one by King himself), but neither of them really captured what makes The Shining such a standout novel, not just in King's work, but in the field of American letters in general. When King is considered, in years to come, one of the 20th century's great novelists, this will be one of the books studied extensively.
0553382179|4.0|When I first picked up this book at the library, I wasn't sure I would find anything useful in it.  I had a little clutter, but I didn't feel that it had taken over my home.  And I already knew how to clean my house.  Like some of the other reviewers, I didn't care for the writer's style. (&quot;Finally Loving Yourself&quot;?  How silly!)  And some of the gushing testimonials grated on my nerves.<br />But it turned out that I actually did find that much of the book was useful.  Cilley's approach is all about getting into a good routine.  If you plan to do a little bit each day, then you don't have to subject yourself to frantic cleaning frenzies when you are getting ready for company.  Many people, like me, who are busy and easily sidetracked can benefit from this kind of advice.<br />I don't follow this approach to the letter.  I don't wear shoes in the house.  I don't toss out 27 items at a time; I did this at first, but I quickly ran out of stuff to toss.  I've incorporated much of her advice into my routine, and it has helped me to maintain a cleaner, more peaceful and inviting home.  I love the 15-minutes-at-a-time approach.  It makes it so much easier to get started on something if you give yourself permission to set it aside in a short while.  And that's the key for many of us -- getting started.  It's not all about de-cluttering; if you don't have that much clutter, you can move on to more detailed cleaning chores that some people might overlook.<br />Oh yeah -- about Cilley's writing style.  As I've said, I wasn't wild about it at first, but I eventually came around to see her as refreshingly unpretentious.  As for the annoying gushing testimonials, I get it now.  I can't blame these people for their enthusiasm for something that really has improved their lives.<br />Judging by some of the other reviews, I guess this book isn't for everyone.  But I would recommend this book to anyone who might need a little direction when it comes to establishing routines,to anyone who doesn't know where to start, and especially to anyone who feels overwhelmed by clutter.

B0002858YS|1.0|This was a major dissapointment, especially after reading the Rolling Stone review which compared the Killers to the Psychedelic Furs, New Order, and Joy Division.  The fact is the Killers have nothing in common with those bands, and Brandon Flowers' lyrics and vocals don't hold a candle to Richard Butler or Ian Curtis.  If this band had even the tenth of the talent any of the aforementioned lyricists had, it would be a major improvement.  This is rubbish, and not all that far from the mindless garbage rammed down your throat on MTV or modern radio.
B0002GTWQA|4.0|If you favor the David Lean approach to grand scale epic film-making, you mustn't miss a wide screen viewing of this gem. It is too thoughtful, intelligent, even philosophic to move at a pace which would suit devotees of todays thrill-a-minute offerings, yet it offers so many rewards which are seldom found these days.  Amidst lushly photographed, exotic settings and loaded with fabulous performances by some of the screen's all-time finest actors, \\"Lord Jim\\" dares to mix action adventure with a penetrating examination of moral issues like courage and honor and integrity.  The visual production is wondrous and makes a quality widescreen edition intensely desireable and long overdue.
B000002UB3|2.0|Given that &quot;Let It Be&quot; had not been released by the time &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was recorded, it's unfortunate that the unfinished songs on side two of Abbey Road as well as the stupid Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octopuses Garden weren't replaced by some of the better songs on Let It Be.  As a result, the Beatles finished with yet another sub-par album in typical post-1965 fashion; a few good songs, with lots of silliness and filler interspersed among them.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Now that Madge is on her way down, she'll need to get some new skills. I heard they need a dish washer at George Webb's. Think Madge can handle it?
B000002UAR|2.0|&quot;really tuneful...really whacky...really psychedelic...really social...really unusual...&quot;  yeah.<br />There are only a few songs on this album that reflect the greatness achieved by the Beatles pre-1965, which is sad.  Nowhere near albums like Help or A Hard Day's Night.
B000000H57|5.0|A friend introduced me to Type-O Negative quite a few years ago.  At first I was reluctant to listen to it because I thought the band was a bunch of vampire-wannabe freaks.  Back then I knew nothing about Gothic music, but I was a huge metal fan--listening to everything from Metallica to Pantera and Halford in-between.  Since my first listen and thousands more this album has grown on me exponentially to the point of being the one album I can listen to over and over and never get tired of.  The music is just so full of emotion.  At first some of the songs depressed me, but now it's like coming home.  It actually cheers me up and puts me in a melancholy mood that fits perfectly with who I am.  Type-O doesn't take themselves or their lyrics seriously at times, which is a waste in my opinion, because this album is a pinnacle that may never be reached again by any Gothic band.  It's *that* good.  I've been searching all over the place for something similar, but the haunting mood of this album can't be matched.  In my opinion October Rust is the epitomy of Gothic music and Type-O hit the nail in the coffin (er on the head) with this album.  Words can't express how good this album is.  Buy it and let yourself be taken away to a world you never knew existed.  &quot;Die with Me&quot; and &quot;Love You to Death&quot; are two songs I can relate to; love in its deepest form.  &quot;Red Water (Christmas Mourning)&quot; is so sad that you can't stop listening to it.  &quot;Haunted&quot; is by far my favorite track.  I could listen to Peter's deep singing all day.  The interlude in the middle of the song is just perfect.  &quot;In Praise of Bacchus&quot;, &quot;Burnt Flowers Fallen&quot; and &quot;Wolf Moon&quot; are powerful.  &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; and &quot;My Girlfriend's Girlfriend&quot; are typical Type-O fun.  If you've never heard Gothic music before and want to hear the best right up front this is the only album you will need.  It will leave you wanting more.  The other Type-O albums don't reach this level of perfection and emotion.  They broke the Gothic mold and nothing else compares.  8 years since its release it's still best.  Stop reading this review and buy the album now.  If you don't you'll be missing out on something truly monumental in music.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|A four disc edition? Who can ask for more? Obviously we saw it coming... the remake was there... the Divimax edition early this year... everybody was saying a big multi-disc edition was coming... and here it is!<br />To start analyzing this film we must take a look at NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. This film was a landmark as it introduced the zombies as we know today. Now, DAWN OF THE DEAD set a new landmark. In it, the zombies were a mature (sub)genre in modern cinema.<br />What makes this film so important? Everything! First it is the brilliant screenplay. The story... you already know: as the zombie population increases more and more, four people barricate themselves inside a big shopping mall, where they endulge themselves with all consumering desires they can think of.<br />Sounds simple? It is, but there is more than meets the eye: as the zombies try to get in (you'll have to wonder why) the four heroes inside discover their paradise makes them more empty than they would have thought it would... and slowly, life start making no sense.<br />DAWN OF THE DEAD is the kind of film that has been changing as the decades pass. Its violence seems to have softened if we think of all the action and horror films who came in the decades that followed (just like it happened with other horror landmarks like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). Its makeup is not comparable to the vast majority of horror films that came after (who had bigger makeup budgets)... but on the other hand, elements like tension, drama, character development and social critique have all grown more powerful then in all of the films that followed.<br />In other words, audiences who see this film today, many times discover the fact that its weight is changing fields... from graphic horror to social horror. And this kind of horror is no less potent and much more rare.<br />Mr. Romero is one of those rare horror screenwriter/directors who do have a strong critic point of view (and we can see it as he continues to deliver so in his later third zombie film - the sadly underated gem - DAY OF THE DEAD).<br />Clearly, this is a multi-layered film that demands multiple levels of reading. You must be aware of all the issues put inside this film. Otherwise, if you're in just for the cheap thrills, gore and violence, you'll probably be disappointed.<br />As a product of the late seventies, this is a production triumph because it manages to deliver a lot with minimum budget. The remake released early this year made a great update on this basic premisse.<br />I loved them both.<br />This edition seems to be more than we've all asked for (now that the simpler Divimax edition made all the money it could...). Here, you'll find all the versions and lots of extras.<br />But again... DAWN OF THE DEAD is a film that I am sure will be seen and celebrated for years to come. See it with an open mind and you too will discover why.c point of view (and we can see it as he continues to deliver so in his later third zombie film - the sadly underated gem - DAY OF THE DEAD).<br />Clearly, this is a multi-layered film that demands multiple levels of reading.

B0000CABBW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, even though I thought the main charachter should of been a boy. The main premise of the story was of two fraternal twins (boy and girl). The girl survived and was discouraged from becoming a chief. Yet she persevered and trained with the help of some other villagers even though  her grandfather wanted a male heir. Her grandfather's goal was to recruit one of the boys from the village school. There were tests of fighting skills and retrieving a whale medallion that the grandfather threw into the ocean. I would highly recommend this movie because it made me feel very good to watch it. You are going to get your monies worth whether you rent it or buy it from amazon.com
B00008EYA5|2.0|I skipped this one in theater because it looked cheesy and man is it ever. Colin Farrel and Sam Jackson's talents are wasted in this mess of an action movie and the dialogue and realism of SWAT is below-average at very best. Don't even rent this stinker, catch it on cable for free.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is GNR's best songs from each of their albums on one CD. Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, and Paradise City are from Appetite For Destruction. Nightrain or Rocket Queen would've been nice additions to this album. And Patience the only hit from GNR Lies is a great acoustic song. 7 of the songs are from the Use Your Illusion albums, my favorite is November Rain and Knockin' On Heaven's Door (which is a cover of Bob Dylan's song). And on The Spaghetti Incident Ain't It Fun (The Dead Boys) and Since I Don't Have You (The Skyliners) are 2 great cover songs and are very underrated. Also Sympathy For the Devil a rolling stones cover song was great, in fact it's better then the rolling stones version and its underrated. It could've had maybe Estranged, Nightrain or Rocket Queen on it.<br />Anyways, if you want all of GNR's hits on 1 CD instead of buying 6 CD's to have all these songs then buy it.
1400032717|5.0|I am so grateful I purchased this remarkable book. Getting into the mind of an autistic child gives the reader a phenomenal look at the complexities of this disorder.<br />Christopher is a remarkable boy and the author who created him, a remarkable man.  This book will, in time, be considered a classic.  I intend to put it away for my grandchildren to read when they are old enough.  They are just beginning to be exposed to children with special needs.<br />This book was humorous, suspenseful, sad, happy and simply wonderful.  It is a book for all time and what a great film it would make.  I hope someone discovers it for that reason.<br />Thank you Mr. Haddon.  You are a genius!!
B000274THQ|3.0|An intelligent and compelling comedy (or dramedy), \\"Good Bye Lenin\\" presents an interesting portrait of the multiple changes that affected Germany a few years ago. Managing to offer a strong social/political/historical perspective about the evolution of his country, director Wolfgang Becker also delivers a solid character study about a youngster and his relationship with his mother, touching issues such as the generation gap or the power of a lie. The acting is good overall (Daniel Bruhl is very convincing), the directing is clever, the plot is gripping and the soundtrack (by Yann Tiersen) is superbly crafted, which makes for an above average cinematic experience.<br />Recommended.
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is the album on which Eric Patrick Clapton, Slowhand, emerged as one of the most innovative and original guitarists in the world. Clapton created a new sound when he combined a sunburst 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard through a Marshall amplifier. And while blues guitarists like B.B. King, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, Buddy Guy, Freddy King, Otis Ruch, Albert King had pioneered the electric blues guitar idiom, Eric Clapton brought it into the popular mainstream and transformed it. The blues guitar now became an integral part of popular music and rock and roll. This is where Clapton showed how it could be done. He perfected the role of the guitar hero on the Beano album of 1966.<br /><br />Clapton had begun the transformation of the electric guitar while he was with the Yardbirds. He had electrifying solos on the Yardbird's GOODMORNING LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL and on GOT TO HURRY. Clapron had explosive and electric solos on The Yardbirds singles. Clapton wanted to develop and evolve his guitar style with the Yardbirds. But when they decided to go commercial and release pop material, Clapton quit the band. But Beano merely continues where Clapton left off with the Yardbirds. Unlike with the Yardbirds, however, John Mayall lets Clapton take center stage and allows him to realize his vision of the electric guitar. What results is a landmark recording. The album also features John McVie, who later formed Fleetwood Mac, on bass. Hughie Flint is on drums while John Mayall is the lead vocalist, playing keyboards and harmonica.<br /><br />This album had a major impact in transforming the electric guitar from a secondary instrument to center stage. Eddie Van Halen cited Beano as the album that most influenced him. Jimi Hendrix purchased a copy and wanted to duplicate Clapton's sound. Hendrix even bought a Marshall amp like Clapton so he could get that thick distorted sound that Clapton got on Beano. Beano showed what you could do when you combined the blues and the electric guitar fed through an overdriven amplifier. The blues did not have to be a peripheral musical form or idiom but could now take center stage. Clapton showed everyone how. He had the vision and the commitment to make it happen. As Clapton himself said, he wanted to change the world and to shake up the music scene. And he did just that with Beano.<br /><br />The album opens with the powerful ALL YOUR LOVE, which Stevie Ray Vaughan covered. Clapton has blistering guitar solos. On DOUBLE CROSSING TIME, a song Clapton co-wrote with Mayall, Clapton's solos are searing. A nice touch to WHAT'D I SAY? is Clapton playing the Beatles' DAY TRIPPER riff in the second half of the song. Clapton scorches on Freddy King's HIDEAWAY guitar workout. Clapton is on fire throughout the album. There are two bonus tracks that comprise the single that was released at the time. BERNARD JENKINS is an instrumental written by Clapton.<br /><br />This is a must-own album for any guitarist. This is a landmark album that transformed the electric guitar and ushered in the guitar god or guitar hero. But Clapton was the first one. Clapton is indeed SUPERMAN INSIDE and God! Hear for yourself why they called Clapton god and why Jimi Hendrix wanted to first meet Clapton when he arrived in England in 1966.<br /><br />Little Steven of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band said of Clapton: \\"Eric Clapton is the most important and influential guitar player that has ever lived, is still living or ever will live.\\" Eric Clapton is the greatest guitarist that ever lived. Jimi Hendrix went to England to meet him and performed the \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" on the Lulu TV Show as a tribute to Clapton. Hendrix's first gig in England was as an invited guest on a Cream concert stage on October 1, 1966 when he jammed with Clapton. Jeff Beck replaced him in the Yardbirds. Eddie Van Halen learned to play electric guitar off of Clapton records. Eric Clapton was elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame three times, as a member of the Yardbirds, as a member of Cream, and as a solo artist. Eric Clapton could do it all. Ecstatic fans wrote graffiti in the 1960s that \\"Clapton is God\\". He is arguably the most influential and most important guitarist that ever lived.olo artist. Eric Clapton could do it all. Ecstatic fans wrote graffiti in the 1960s that \\"Clapton is God\\". He is arguably the most influential and most important guitarist that ever lived.
B000000OAC|5.0|We've seen mountains & mountains of albums where you hear the artist's hit tune, followed by track after track of filler. Then there are a decent amount of albums that contain a healthy dose of quality music in addition to the familiar hit. This album, however, is one of those rare works that is GREAT music from the opening hit tracks 'til the closer. <br />Unless you've been tucked away in the wilderness since 1977, you no doubt have heard snippets of &quot;We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions?&quot; on TV, in movies, or at the end of various victorious home team games. What follows is a collection of some of Queen's greatest work, most of which does not make it onto the &quot;Best Of&quot; compilations. If you love Queen?s musical legacy, but only have one or two of their albums, you really should grab &quot;News of the World.&quot; In my humble book, it ranks as a greatest hits CD unto itself.<br />The melodic &quot;We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions&quot; is followed by a high quality-high-speed &quot;Sheer Heart Attack,&quot; and then shifts into a slow and beautiful mournful tune called &quot;All Dead.&quot; <br />The next song is one of the most underrated of Freddie Mercury?s vocal efforts in &quot;Spread Your Wings.&quot; It's not one of those songs where Mercury hits those mind-blowing high notes like he does in &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; or &quot;Lily of the Valley,&quot; but there is a passion in his voice that makes this song tops. I remember it getting a smattering of airplay when it came out in ?77, but it should have received much more radio time than it did. <br />&quot;Get Down, Make Love&quot; is one of those fashionably guttural tunes in the same vein of &quot;Tie Your Mother Down.&quot; &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot; is a cute rags-to-riches-to-rags tune, just this shy of being an acoustic folky piece. &quot;Who Needs You&quot; is one cute and campy tune which reminds me of some of their wackier songs from the &quot;Radio-Ga-Ga&quot;era, &quot;It's Late&quot; is one of their rawer efforts, and &quot;My Melancholy Blues&quot; is another sweet sad song where Mercury really grand-slams his vocal range.<br />From the cover art work to the lyrics to the music, this is one of Queen's finest.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is off the hook. I love the flaming lips and would definitely buy this album.
078322611X|5.0|This ranks as one of my favorite movies of all time.  You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate the nostalgia and warm heartedness this movie brings to the big screen - well little screen in the case of the DVD.  It's part ghost story, part fantasy, part nostalgia.  It's also about redemption and the fulfillment of dreams.  <br />The story begins when Ray Kinsella, a reluctant Iowa farmer, although he won't admit he's reluctant, starts hearing a voice telling him \\"build it and he will come.\\"  Ray dreams, ponders and finally plows under many acres of his crop to build a baseball field on his farm, against all rational logic.  And the magic begins.  This magic takes Ray on a strange quest in search of a '60s radical holed up in a New York City apartment writing children's books played by James Earl Jones - to tell why would spoil the movie.  But suffice it to say Jones ends up with one of the most memorable \\"speeches\\" in the movie about the nostalgia of baseball.  <br />It's hard to really do justice to the plot without spoiling the movie but it will at times give you chills and in the end is very uplifting.

The package is good song as well !
0790729709|5.0|When this movie first came out the critics panned it mercilessly and frankly I just can't understand why.  I thought it was fabulous.  Kevin Costner plays an ex-Secret Service agent hired to protect a spoiled, difficult to get along with diva receiving death threats.  Whitney Houston portrays the spoiled starlet to perfection.  The chemistry and interplay between Houston and Costner was electric.  The music in the movie was also great.<br />There are really some key elements that made this movie extremely good.  First, I thought the acting was top notch by all involved.  The supporting cast really played their characters well, as did the stars.  Secondly, the editing was outstanding.  The movie and plot move along at a fast pace.  There is not a dull moment in the entire movie.  And finally, the plot was plausible (for the most part) and the mystery - who is the hit man - slowly reveals itself.  Having watched the movie several times, there a several foreshadowings.<br />Overall I found it a most entertaining movie both as a mystery, a thriller, and love story.
B00008H2LB|5.0|After I had heard \\"Hybrid Theory\\" I realised that in my opinion this is the best band ever, taking into consideration all new metal bands, such as Evanescence, KoRn, Marylin Manson, etc. When I had heard this album lots of time I expected more of this band and I've got it with \\"Meteora\\", an excellent and exciting album, which combines rap and new metal genres. But this CD is special. Moreover, it has songs that gets you astonished and you want more and more and you can't help listening to it due to the rich riffs and scratches that you can hear in almost all songs. By then, Linkin Park has released an album called \\"Live in Texas\\" with lots of songs from their albums \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", live.     <br />01 Foreword: an interesting description of the album.<BR>02 Don't Stay: with this song you get into the \\"Linkin Park's World\\", I mean, it is not new to hear a song like this by this band.<BR>03 Somewhere I Belong: this is the first single and its video-clip is amazing. The song is not excellent, but is pretty good. I love the beginning!!!<BR>04 Lying From You: an excellent song by all means! I adore the introduction, too!<BR>05 Hit The Floor: up to now, the songs sound familiar. This one has lots of screams and it is too repetitive. <BR>06 Easier To Run: a slow song, similar to \\"Crawling\\", from the first album. I like it cos it prepares you to what follows then.<BR>07 Faint: the second single and an outstanding song!!! I reckon this one is the best song in this album. The 3rd verse, when Chester screams without end is the best part. Well done up to now, LP!!!<BR>08 Figure.09: I do not know why the song is called like that but it is very catchy and creative. The best part is the 3rd verse, when Chester screams \\"Get away from here!\\"<BR>09 Breaking The Habit: this, I reckon, will be the last single from \\"Meteora\\" as the band is working hardly on their new album. The videoclip is not that bad but is not so good as Faint or even Numb. However, I love the song and, to me, is the best song after Faint and Numb.<BR>10 From The Inside: excellent song and very good videoclip. This is the song where Chester most screams in the 3rd verse.<BR>11 Nobody's Listening: this is a song that when you first hear it you think that someone has put another CD on the cd recorder, as it differs completely from LP'songs. But I can say this song is an amazing rap song. It is full of scratches and superb riffs!!!<BR>12 Session: this is an instrumental song and it is very well fit before the last track.<BR>13 Numb: the 2nd best song in this album and the 3rd single. It is kinda slow but it is really outstanding!!!<br />Hey, that's all. I consider \\"Meteora\\" and \\"Fallen\\" (Evanescence) being the best albums I have ever heard. Keep on working hard, LP, and for all LP fans, buy this CD immediately unless you already have it.<br />***(...)
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the greatest combination of musical genius ever created. I feel that Billy Corgan achieved Musical Immortality with the earth shattering collection that is these two CDs. A huge collection of all types of rock, so no matter what your flavor, you will find it all in this stunning variety. It's the only album I have ever listened to that I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of the songs. Galapogos, Tonight, Tonight, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Stumbleine, and Zero rank among my all time favorite songs. I completely recommend the collection of B-Sides from this album found in the &quot;Aeroplane Flies High&quot; box set. If you have never heard of the Smashing Pumpkins (Shame, if you haven't) or simply have never picked up this album, do now, as you will enjoy it till the end of time. It's just too bad the greatest band ever formed is no longer around, but their music will live on forever

B0000640VN|1.0|Since this was a Meg Ryan movie I was ready to be bored out of my mind and I wasn't disappointed. Meg plays cute and perky Kate, a street smart New York executive. She has everything going for her except one thing-she has lousy luck in men. This is where it gets interesting and I use that term loosely. Her ex-boyfriend who happens to be living right above her discovers a hole in time that will allow him to go back to nineteenth century and he does just that. Complications arise, however, and a Duke of Albany, from 1876, who is incidentally young, handsome and unmarried, accidentally follows him back through time to present time New York. If that sounds stupid, you've heard nothing yet. He gets in all these incidents because obviously he never seen any of the modern technology which I assume filmmakers wanted to be funny but it wasn't. It was boring as hell. I bet you can guess what happens next. Duke meets Kate, they fall in love because he has nice manners, he goes back in time because balance must be preserved, of course Kate follows him into nineteenth century, they get married and live happily ever after. Oh, I forgot to mention number of boring discussions they have about love and all that. Can someone shoot me, please!.
B0000039PW|5.0|First of all, \\"The Warning\\", is probably the best Hip-Hop storytelling song ever, because usually rappers who try get off the subject, and Biggie doesn't.  \\"Gimme The Loot\\" is a really tight song, because it showcases Biggie's creativity(he raps in his regular voice and a high pitched voice).  \\"Everyday Struggles\\" is a good song about him growing up.  \\"Juicy\\" is very different from the rest of the album and that's not a bad thing.  It's more of a peaceful rags to riches song.  \\"The What\\" features the only guest appearence(Method Man), which is strange because Biggie had beef with Meth's Wu-Tang partner Raekwon.  The two bonus tracks are good, especially \\"Who Shot Ya\\".  Sadly, this classic was tarnished by Ja Rule's remade version \\"I Shot Ya\\"(against 50 Cent).<br />This album is simply a classic.  The intro(Biggie's birth and life) and the final song \\"Suicidal Thoughts(Biggie's death) is amazingly put together.  As far as songs, there's no filler, but the skit \\"F*** Me\\" is dumb.  <br />Get this if you love Hip-Hop or if u just love hard music
B00005221M|4.0|My biggest complaint with this movie is that story was changed and not for the better. In the original novel, Cora(played by Madeline Stowe) was in love with Uncas(who is the last of the Mohican tribe) and Hawkeye was just some old guide, along for the ride. Also Cora's sister Alice is in love with Duncan, the English officer. In this movie there is a major turnaround. There is a love triangle-Duncan is in love with Cora who is in love with Hawkeye, who is young and attractive, and Alice has feelings for Uncas(and there is no character development for either one of them). I think perhaps the producers had a problem with an interracial angle although in this day and age you'd think Hollywood has gotten over it. I guess not. None the less, I liked the film-the story was still compelling enough, battle scenes were impressive and I loved the soundtrack(I own it, as a matter of fact).
B00006J9OT|5.0|I bought &quot;Girl in the Other Room&quot; and did not care for that depressing album at all. But when a friend played this for me, I could not believe it was the same singer. This is an amazing album, full of swing, sass, life and great orchestration, everything the other album is not. I am going to have to listen to her other previous albums now. This one was wonderful, I hope there is more from this singer like this!
B00005NKKZ|4.0|This is undeniably a beautiful classic, one of the soothing albums of 1970 that ushered in a new era of softer music, like a comforting hug to the survivors of all of the chaos and pain of the late Sixties.  And the title track and &quot;The Boxer&quot; (my all-time fave song of theirs) are two of the greatest songs from the Top 40 era ever.  Still, it's not as consistent or all-around great as 'Bookends' or PSR&amp;T.  Depending on whom you ask, it has between three and six clunkers on it.  I personally think only &quot;Why Don't You Write Me,&quot; the supposedly live cover of &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; (I agree with the reviewer who said it sounds like applause was just dubbed over the song, and wonder why the audience was so into this mediocre performance), and &quot;So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; are throwaways.  The only good part about the lattermost song is the pretty melody and the &quot;So long already, Artie!&quot; taunt during the fadeout.  Otherwise it does absolutely nothing for me.  &quot;Baby Driver&quot; and &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot; are upbeat and fun to listen to, but not classics.  They're the kinds of songs you like, good songs, but not the type considered the highlight of an album or an undisputed classic like the title track always will be.  &quot;Cecilia&quot; is a cute happy song too, but I can see where other people get off calling it pop drivel.<br />The other songs on here I like best, besides the title track and &quot;The Boxer,&quot; are the haunting &quot;El Condor Pasa,&quot; &quot;Baby Driver&quot; (it's fun and upbeat despite not being a classic), &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York,&quot; and the beautiful understated closer &quot;A Song for the Asking.&quot;  Overall the songs are well-crafted and mature, just that on a classic album such as this, they should all measure up to the standard set by the two greatest songs it has to offer, instead of having as many clunkers as it has.
B00005QGAX|5.0|BAD is personally my favourite MJ album! He shows his unique and amazing songwriting skills..<BR>Bad-A great beat with catchy lyrics,the video is great too.10/10<BR>The Way You Make Me Feel-This song is probably one of my favourite songs off BAD-The rhythm,the beat,the lyrics and the vocals just make you want to be the girl MJ's chasing =D 10/10<BR>Speed Demon-Another amazing song,10/10<BR>Liberian Girl-MJ uses a lot of vocal in this song,it's not my favourite but it's most definitely worth listening to,9.5/10<BR>Just Good Friends-MJ and Stevie sound really great here,kinda cheesy but i love it!9/10<BR>Another Part Of Me-Beautiful song,10/10<BR>Man in the mirror-A truly inspiring song,it brings tears to your eyes and makes you sing along with Michael-a must-10/10<BR>I just can't stop loving you-Gorgeous song,MJ and Sieddah make you want to fall in love=)10/10<BR>Dirty Diana-Probably one of the greatest rock songs in history,the lyrics,the vocals,ahh,10/10<BR>Smooth Criminal-Again,another favourite,Michael is amazing,i mean,what a beat!!!!Lyrics rock and his dancing is flawless,but then again,Michael is flawless,Alien Ant Farm,in my opinion shouldn't have sung this song,No-one can record an MJ song,he is truly unique,10/10!<BR>Leave me Alone-Very cool song,against the media and tabloids,rocky song,9.5/10<BR>Streetwalker-Now this is my favourite song again,i really feel it should've been included on BAD-it's amazing,i love it.10/10<BR>MJ is 100000000000% innocent!
B000002ORU|4.0|It's not that this is bad material (with some exceptions, like the horrible alternate &quot;The Real Me&quot; that should have stayed unreleased), just that there are a LOT of little mistakes and annoyances that really add up.  One or two mistakes or annoyances would have been understandable and easy to ignore, but not when they keep happening over and over again.  The constant seguing of the songs is by far the worst error.  This technique only works well when the end of the first song and the beginning of the following one sound enough alike to phased in and out simultaneously.  Many times there isn't even one single nanosecond of breathing space between songs.  There are also a few songs which are a mix of studio and live versions, like &quot;A Quick One&quot; and &quot;See Me, Feel Me.&quot;  Other big errors are mislabelling &quot;Sparks&quot; (the live Woodstock version) as &quot;Underture.&quot;  They never did &quot;Underture&quot; live.  The live &quot;Bargain&quot; on here is also shortened by about a minute; the full-length version of this particular live rendition is found on the rarities compilation 'Who's Missing,' which was released some years before this boxed set came along.  There are also a number of errors in the booklet, like giving incorrect chart positions for some songs and reinforcing the common but incorrect belief that Keith Moon was born in 1947; he was born in 1946 but lied about his age so people would think he was younger.<br />Besides the constant seguing, the other most annoying thing on here is the inclusion of way too many songs from 'Sell Out,' a total of eight of the original thirteen.  There's also too much material from 'Who's Next' and the original LAL.  Giving more than three or four songs from each album is no longer just giving a little sample of each album represented, and it feels jarring hearing them all played out of order, with so many songs from those albums included.  Maybe that's the reason why there were barely any songs from their sorely underrated Eighties catalogue, with only one song apiece from their final two studio albums and then the next two Eighties songs being really poorly representative of that period.  They could have picked a better song from 'Who's Last,' as bland a live effort as it may be, in lieu of the live version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; they used, as well as a better song from the '89 triple-LP 'Join Together' over the endless live rendition of &quot;I'm a Man.&quot;  The final song, a '91 cover of the Elton John song &quot;Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting),&quot; is fun and peppy, but could have been included somewhere else if it had to be included at all.  That is not the track you use to close a boxed set with; it should have been so obvious that the final track should have been a blistering live version of &quot;WGFA&quot; or &quot;SMFM&quot;!<br />Still, the material included here is by and large great, along with some cute Keith skits done for the BBC, interviews, onstage dialogue, and studio conversations held before songs.  There are also a lot of songs that were unreleased before this boxed set came along, though since then most of them have been released as bonus tracks on the CD remasters.  And some of the songs are still hard to find on CD, are only on vinyl, or are hard to find altogether, whatever the format they're available on, like the irresistably cute ditty &quot;Dogs,&quot; &quot;Call Me Lightning,&quot; and the High Numbers-era material like &quot;Here 'Tis&quot; and &quot;Zoot Suit&quot;; before this, only the High Numbers song &quot;I'm the Face&quot; was available on an official release.  It's too bad they couldn't have cut some of the superfluous songs to make room for more rarities, like &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; or some of the songs on the out-of-print 'Two's Missing.'  Overall, the many mistakes and annoyances aren't enough to overlook the fact that it's still great material.  I'm lucky I found a used copy of this, complete with the booklet, for only $35 in a used record store!py of this, complete with the booklet, for only $35 in a used record store!

B00004R99J|1.0|I wish my children had never seen this movie, but since I made the mistake of trusting Disney and since it reappears on TV frequently, I've used it as an opportunity to talk about the blatant (but politically-correct) racism woven through it.  My point to my children:  racism is wrong, no matter who it's directed at (a point that goes directly against the main theme of the movie).<br />In this movie, there is one and only one exception to the rule that all Native Americans are good and all English are bad.  John Smith is the exception that proves the rule - other than him, all British are evil (and crude, dirty, greedy, etc.).  The Native Americans aren't all quite perfect but all come around in the end, while the English are clearly rotten to the core, and the world would be a better place if they were all gone.<br />Get this movie for your children IF you want to teach them to use skin color as a way of predicting good versus evil.  And don't worry, they won't get the wrong, racist lesson that dark skin is bad - they'll get the politically-correct lesson, that people with white skin are bad.
B00009ATIX|1.0|On the up side, good sets and costumes. Lame special effects combo with a plot so crippled that it's wheelchair needs crutches. George Clooney, bless his handsome heart, is unable to rescue this total waste of mind with his limited acting range, although you can see him painfully trying. Unless you are really into abnormal foresnic psychology then within 15 minutes of watching Solaris you will be asking yourself if you really want to sit through the rest of it. I did, and I did sit through the rest and it wasn't worth it. Buy another movie.
0385504209|4.0|Brown's latest thriller is all the rage this season, and it's a pretty good page-turner. The curator of the Louvre is murdered and intrepid Harvard scholar Robert Langdon (you met him in Brown's last book) meets up with another European girl (this time she's French instead of Italian).  Hijinks follow.  The historical research is wide, without ever being deep. But it adds a fun veneer of deep mystical somesuch to the plot. Leonardo da Vinci, secret Vatican cabals, Opus Dei, mystical this-and-that.  It makes for a fun read.<br />As other critics have pointed out, the facts of the book are often muddled and inaccurate, suggesting the research may have been done by one of those credulous sorts who always believes the last thing he reads. The characters are paper-thin cutouts, mere devices who grab hold of the plot early on and cling to it for dear life. The dialogue is silly and predictable. The author's irritating penchant for hanging on to clues and half-clues, doling them out slowly is a device of the B-grade pop mystery novel.  Like its predecesors, this book is sort of a middleweight version of Umberto Eco's towering novels.  Not too challenging, but it keeps the pop public entranced, sells a bunch of copies, and lets us all feel like we're initiates into some secret society. Bravo -- a lot of fun !
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I loved this movie! I watched it 9 times in five days. I cannot get enough of Jeremy Sumpter. The effects are amazing. I think you would have to be crazy to dislike this movie. It is by far better than Hook. I hated that movie. I was watching it and fell asleep. But P.J. Hogan's version of this classic story kept me wide awake.
0380789035|3.0|I'm a longtime fan of Neil Gaiman's work, but after reading American Gods it seems to me that dialogue is not the strongest aspect of his talent. The novel's concept is brilliant - the Old World gods fighting for survival in the New World - but Gaiman lacks a vision for where his characters are going (ironic, because it always seemed he was in complete control of this in his Sandman work). So, the novel ambles along and occasionally becomes downright boring.  Gaiman is at his best when telling stories of the old gods - his gift is clearly his ability to construct an intriguing narrative - but he is at his worst when characters actually have to speak to one another. Dialogue often sounds forced, particularly when Gaiman attempts to have them speak &quot;American&quot; English.<br />It's clear the author was aiming for a great American novel, but he only sees the surface and his ear for how we Americans sound is superficial at best.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|I know of no women of any age, race, or ethnicity who listen to Rage's music. Rage is strictly a band for teenage male sheep who think they're doing the world some great justice by being &quot;political&quot; by listening to &quot;political&quot; music. Sure, just like the majority of Americans, I want Bush to get the hell out of office too, but instead of creating the chaos and moshpit-like riots that Rage want, we need to unite and vote against the hate-filled warmonger instead. The reality with Rage is that they're all about touting militant bullsh*t 90% of the time, and their fans don't even realize it. They just like de la Rocha's violent vocal delivery and stage presence because he makes being militant anthematic. He's mucho macho, that Zach de la Rocha. Rage Against the Machine have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to certain issues that they should have absolutely no say in. Rage Against the Machine claim they are for freedom and citizens' rights to do what they believe is in their best interest, but then Rage come out with an anti-abortion song (&quot;Born as Ghosts&quot;). And it's always the men who don't understand women that come out against abortion. Either those types of men, or Christian fundamentalists. Tom Morello thinks that just because he went to Harvard that he can spew his own personal bullsh*t views and have them be true. Sorry guy, but your opinion isn't what anyone else should live their life by, so quit acting like you state any facts. Hey, Tom, if you think you should have a say in whether a woman can get an abortion, how about we decide whether or not you can get a testicular cancer removed? <br />Question the government and all forms of media, especially music that shouts it tells the truth, because truth is in the eye of the beholder. There are as many truths as there are individuals in the world.

B00006V9A0|1.0|Ever heard of karma? It has to do with how quick a person attains nirvana. It's dealt with in many religions (in some form or another), but is known best as pertaining to Buddhist and Hindu religions. Karma is basically the cosmos' way of proving &quot;What goes around comes around&quot;. There are many types of karma, including the well known type that deals with an individual's karma. Then, there is collective karma. Collective karma is based on who you know and hang out with. So, for instance, if you hang out with drug dealers, thieves, liars, and other less than savory characters, their bad karma rubs off on you. It's basically guilt by association, but since it's portioned out by the cosmos, what're ya gonna do? Anyway, I must say, if ever there was bad collective karma, nobody has it much worse than the Cobain clan. Many of Kurt's relatives (obviously, him included) committed suicide. Nearly all of his relatives, close relatives, and friends were addicted to either booze or drugs. Kurt's wife, the insane Courtney Love was once again recently committed to a mental institution ... after constantly being in and out of them throughout her teenage years. Apparently, her recent trip to the loony bin was because of a suicide attempt she made. She now has a &quot;legal guardian&quot; (AKA a state-appointed mental health monitor) to make her decisions and speak on her behalf because she isn't competent to make her own choices or talk on her own will. It sounds like she'll be in there for a while. Don't like the concept of karma just explained? Well, sucks for you, because this is what Kurt believed in and named Nirvana after.

B00006V9A0|1.0|I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves. They'd do anything for &quot;Kurdt&quot; and are easily-lead. Just look at the how they say &quot;listening to it makes me like it&quot;. If you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day, would you enjoy THAT? Same concept with these songs. People like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment. Just because you've heard something before isn't necessarily grounds for you to like it.
B00029NMRM|1.0|The only reason I gave this movie even ONE star is because there was no option for zero, or even better, \\"negative stars.\\"  (a little help here, Amazon?)  Anyone who thinks \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\" deserved a sequel needs to seriously reconsider their taste in movies.  No offense, but the original was a crapfest with the only redeeming quality being able to see what Bruce Willis looks like when he acts while asleep.  And in both movies, Matthew Perry's spastic re-hashing of REALLY bad Jerry Lewis only highlights why the \\"Luckiest L'il Hack\\" should count his blessings that he was allowed to ham it up on \\"Friends\\" for the whole ten years.

0452282152|1.0|I didn't like it at all.  I was able to finish it but I credit that to an extremely boring day at work.<br />It never ceases to amaze me that people will grasp onto a book like this and sing its praises.  This is not &quot;literature&quot;.  It is a trite story written for 6th graders.  There is no mystery, nothing left for the imagination, nothing to build toward.  From the moment you meet the main characters you realize where you're being led and how it will all turn out.<br />I closed the book and am left with nothing a few characters that will leave my memory as soon as I begin my next book.  How disappointing!
B0001MDP3G|2.0|If you're a huge &quot;White Stripes&quot; fan like I am (I own both their albums) And you heard through the grape vine that the Guy from White Stripes is in this movie you may be tempted to run out and rent it. But &quot;RENTER BEWARE!&quot; He is hardly in the movie at all. I'd say he was in it a fifth of the amount of time that the guy who got shot in the neck was in it. considering the Epic length of this movie that's not a whole heck of a lot of frames. I'm wondering how much of his footage ended up on the proverbial cutting room floor (if you get my drift). Nuff said...<br /> Here's a question: What about the girl from &quot;White Stripes&quot;--they couldn't find a role for her in this film? I would have cast her as  in a second over the &quot;You had me at hello&quot; chick. I'm thinking about the convienience factor too as recording and performing etc. must have been difficult while the the guy from &quot;White Stripes&quot; was in Transilvainia filming. but I'm no producer nor am I the son of a producer. My dad was a chaufer. Once he waved his hand across the horizan and said &quot;See all that? None of that'll ever be yours.&quot; which is why the one thing I could totally relate to in the movie was how those soldiers at the bottom of the pile must have felt.
0060194995|5.0|Only growing up in the south would enable Harper Lee to capture the vicious sweetness that pervails there.  Not only to capture it but then be able to transfer that on to the reader.  You can smell the sweetness of the talcum through the sticky of the hot summer days.  Sickly sweet.  The church group women are vicious in their sweetness.  Ardently praying for the savages in Africa while embracing the savage mores of the south.  And in the midst of all of this she tells one of the greatest coming of age stories ever written.  Fabulous.  One I read every summer.
B000002J2D|4.0|Steve Hackett's departure is perhaps felt mainly by the overall lack of diversity of this album.  The previous efforts see more style divergence whereas this album portrays more of a consensus in songwriting.<br />Wind &amp; Wuthering, for example, seems to reflect a lot of this album with the songs &quot;all in a mouse's night&quot; &quot;afterglow&quot;, and the main parts of &quot;eleventh earl of mar&quot;.  However it is Steve Hackett's touch that keeps that album more interesting, such as the accoustic interlude in &quot;eleventh earl of mar&quot; or the classic introduction to &quot;Blood on the rooftops.&quot;  Mike Rutherford could not fully duplicate his elegant style, and therefore Tony Banks takes a more dominant role to further fill in the gap that Steve left.<br />That being said, I enjoy listening to this album.  The creativity is definitely still with the three remaining members.  The production is above average, the compositions have nice quirks and touches to them.  Phil Collins does some inspired, non-typical drum/percussion work in addition to his relaxed vocal stylings.  Its middle way between the early 80s efforts and the 70s progressive efforts, so its no surprise that this album can be enjoyed by those on both sides of the tracks.  I'd give it 5 stars, but in comparison to previous genesis works its only a 4 star album.
B00005NGZX|5.0|From the masters of metalcore, Converge!!! From beginning to end &quot;Jane Doe&quot; pummels you with abrasive,majestic,and intense music which makes you do &quot;the one-man mosh&quot; and your jaw to drop all at the same time.In terms of heaviness,Converge brings the meaning to new levels while other bands rely on downtuning and raw production,while Converge does use both of those methods(quite effectively I might add) they bring a staggering amount of energy to the table so to speak.Also packaged quite well and the cover art being done nonetheless by Jacob Bannon himself(great poetic lyrics as well) lends another dimension to Converge,not just musically but artistically.Overall this is an intense experience,not just musically but of body and mind that any fan of extreme music should not be without.Sincerely Amazing.
B000068IEU|1.0|This movie is nothing like people say it is. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only part good about it was the breasts( I say breast I was afraid I wouldn't get posted) and nothing else. I didn't even finish watching it.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|You may always wonder what if &quot;woulda, coulda, shoulda&quot; really happens, and how you can get things fixed. Even yes, you may fix one thing but causing rippling side effects to others like a chain reaction. The possibilities are unlimited. Just like the ride of birth to death, it's unpredictable. This is what the film all about. The ButterFly Effect is dedicated to the Chaos Theory:      &quot;It has been said that something as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.&quot;      About the film, the storyline is very interesting, you may have no idea of what the ending should be. The casting is amazingly done, three sets of the leading characters in 7 years old, 13 years old, and 21 yeasr old, are all look-alike appearance and very convincing. When this film was out in theatrical release, I missed it because of quite few negative critics. So I waited for the DVD out, and it became a well-spent twenty dollars to my DVD collection. This film is superb.      The DVD comes with two film versions: a theatrical release and a director's cut. I strongly recommend that you should watch the director's cut version. It's a bit longer but it fills up lots of gaps & details you don't want to miss. There's also a couple of alternative endings, simply choose the one that make you feel better. Personally, I find the director's cut ending is stronger and more appealing but may not be commerically accepted in general. In addition to the standard features such as director's commentary, visual effects, theatrical trailer, etc., it comes with two bonus documentary: &quot;The Science and Psychology of The Chaos Theory&quot; and &quot;The History and Allure of Time Travel&quot;. These are very helpful resources and over twenty minutes. Overall, you should own it. FIVE FULL STARS.      *** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Butterfly Effect ***   1. Film Rewatchability: MEDIUM-HIGH   2. DVD Featurability: EXCELLENT   3. Picture Quality: EXCELLENT   4. Sound Quality: EXCELLENT      (Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 17-Jul-2004)
B000068IEU|1.0|this movie really sucked, nothing more. I gave it one star because Wes Craven is my favorite movie writer/director.
B00003CX95|5.0|I saw this movie years ago when it first came out. Most movies aren't as good on second viewing.  I just saw it again on DVD and it is BETTER than I remember it. <br />The acting is superb, especially by the young William Wallace at the opening of the film.  Infact all the actors are excellent in this film.  <br />What really takes my breath away in this film is the stunning (pre-computer generated)scenery, music, costumes,  the sets and the magnificent battle scenes which really makes Bravehart a complete cinematic experience.<br />The DVD comes with an entertaining documentary on the making of the film with an excellent full length commentary by director/actor Mel Gibson.  A must in any DVD collection.  Highly recommended.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|When Paramount Home Video first started to release the original series of \\"Star Trek\\" in 1999, I was aghast at the fact that only one DVD with two episodes per DVD were being released one DVD at a time at a very high cost.  The cost to own all 40 volumes (DVD's) was staggering.  Of course, this doesn't even address the amount of shelf space required for all 40 DVD's.<br />Now, with this repackaged version, all 26 episodes of the second season are being released together on 8 disks.  This is the packaged version of the original \\"Star Trek\\" that I fully intend to purchase because even at full list price, the cost of owning the second complete season is less than half the cost of owning its earlier cousins on an equivalent 13 DVD's.  Also, the packaging itself has been designed similarly to the packaging used for other \\"Star Trek\\" series released in complete seasons, meaning that it will only require a small amount of shelf space.  It is also possible that extra documentary and commentary material not released originally will be included in this complete second season box set.<br />The original series of \\"Star Trek\\", that ran for three complete seasons between 1966 and 1969, started a franchise that has included six television series and ten big screen motion pictures.  The main original characters of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Lt. Commander/Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard H. 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley, 1920-1999), Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), Lt. Nyota Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Keonig from 1967-1969), Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney from 1966-1967) and Nurse Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett) have become an inseparable part of Americana.  Though series creator Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) was not able to keep the original series alive for five seasons as originally envisioned (it was cancelled after its third season), he, along with the countless series fans, was able to resurrect it in the form of six motion pictures beginning in 1979 and the first series spin-off, \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" in 1987, which ran for seven years and had spin-offs of its own.  There was also a 22-episode animated version based upon the original series that ran from 1972 to 1974.<br />The most memorable episodes of the second season include \\"Amok Time\\" (Spock's Vulcan mating ritual), \\"The Changeling\\" (the inspiration for the 1979 film \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\"), \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", \\"The Apple\\", \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" (with guest star William Windom as Commodore Matthew Decker, the father of the character Capt. Willard Decker (Stephen Collins) in the 1979 film \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\"), \\"I, Mudd\\" (with returning guest character Harcourt Fenton 'Harry' Mudd, as played by Roger C. Carmel, 1932-1986), \\"Journey to Babel\\" (which introduces Spock's parents: Ambassador Sarek as played by Mark Leonard (1924-1996) and his human wife Amanda as played by Jane Wyatt), \\"Friday's Child\\", \\"The Deadly Years\\", \\"Obsession\\", \\"Wolf in the Fold\\", the fan-favorite \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", \\"A Piece of the Action\\", \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\", \\"A Private Little War\\", \\"Return to Tomrrow\\" (with guest character Dr. Ann Mulhall as played by Diana Muldaur, who also played the unpopular character Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\"), \\"By Any Other Name\\", \\"The Ultimate Computer\\" and \\"Assignment: Earth\\".  The were no truly awful episodes during the second season, but there were a few that had rather weak plots, including the ancient-Greek-inspired \\"Who Mourns for Adonais?\\" the gothic \\"Catspaw\\", the Nazi-inspired \\"Patters of Force\\" and the twentieth-century version of the Roman Empire in the episode \\"Break and Circuses\\".  The episode \\"The Omega Glory\\" was rather good until the final scenes that are somewhat corny.<br />Overall, I rate the 8-DVD set of \\"Star Trek: Original Series Season 2\\" with an anticipatory 5 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, this is how Paramount should have released the original series to begin with.  Thank you Gene Roddenberry for taking all of us \\"where no man has gone before\\".
B00005JKNC|4.0|I liked this movie because it was such a unique idea (at least to me).  Who would've thought of making a movie about a film writer in the 1950s who was accused of being a communist and who drives off one night and accidentally goes off a bridge, hits his head and wakes up on a beach with amnesia in a town where he happens to look exactly like a guy who's been missing in action for 9 and 1/2 years and who everyone is so happy to see, huh?  The conflict being - will he ever remember who he is, and if so, will the government find him, and what will the whole town that he's fallen in love with think?  It's such an interesting story.  Kind of slow paced - but REALLY good if you like those sorts of movies that have a feel good ending with a hero who &quot;finds himself&quot; and leaves a special mark in the lives of some really kind people and ends up being the winner he never knew he truly was.  I only gave it four stars because I wish the DVD had more special features like how they made the movie, but I loved the movie itself.  Watch it! The acting is SUPERB.
0452285186|5.0|Totally sick book and great fun for anyone looking for a five minute distraction from the day!
037571457X|5.0|As an iranian who has lived in similar years as Marjane is talking about, I could totally relate to what she says...This book is so refreshing, deep, and at the same time simple ... I could not put it down, and forced my self to read less so I would not have to wait too long for the second volume to come out... But no, I finished too fast and I'm waiting now... maybe I could start reading the french version...
0375713751|3.0|Yes, the book is humorous.  Yes, the writing is, for the most part, intelligent.  But Kate Reddy is just plain impossible to love (or even like).  She is whiny, selfish, critical, and prone to martyrdom.  I expected the heroine to be one I related to.  Instead, I just wanted to slap her.
B00024BHTC|3.0|Okay, yes there are a buttload of one-star reviews, probably from people who listen to nu-metal and rap, so those can be disregarded.  But the album isn't a gold masterpiece by any means.  Three stars was actually quite generous.  Now, I've got every Nightwish album, and to me, they're really a hit-or-miss band (with a few more misses than hits); I love Oceanborn, I don't mind Century Child, two of the new songs on Over The Hills are favorable, I don't bother with Angels Fall First much anymore, and I can't stomach Wishmaster at all.  So, here goes...<br />First of all, since everyone has it stuck in their heads that Tarja is all there is to Nightwish, I will reiterate that she sounds horrid.  Maybe she should spend less time kissing hubby and puffing cigarettes and more time improving her voice.  Either that, or have enough sense to give up music and let Marco do all the singing.  Marco actually doesn't sound half bad on this one, aside from his Korn scream toward the end of &quot;Wish I Had an Angel.&quot;  Everywhere else, he reminded me a little of Hansi Kursch, although maybe not quite that good.  But Tarja sounds bad.  Her voice keeps cracking and she's off key almost constantly.  Yes, she's classically trained.  Lots of singers are, but it doesn't singlehandedly make them good, and this sounds nothing like what she did on Oceanborn and Angels Fall First, which were her best moments.  On the instrumental front, Tuomas' keyboards are nothing new, Jukka's drumming isn't up to par with other albums, Marco's bass is actually quite good, and Emppu's riffs, while old and tried before, sound pretty good.  The orchestra, I'm sorry to say, only covers up Tuomas' lack of innovation.  I'm getting fed up with bands hiring huge orchestras to make their music for them.  It's not a statement of uniqueness; the novelty wore off, and I'd much rather hear a band make its own music rather than have a 40-piece orchestra do all the work.<br />There are exactly two fully-listenablesongs on this album - &quot;Creek Mary's Blood&quot; (because I'm partial to Native American flutes) and &quot;Higher Than Hope.&quot;  The latter song is purely listenable, not good.  The former isn't too bad.  Everything else is destroyed either by poorly-executed vocals, poorly-designed vocal structures, or poor integration of the guitars and synths together.  The lyrics are pretty sappy and bland.  Overall, there is no doubt that this album was made for radio and popular success.  So, don't expect anything inspired.  There have been rumors that this is the last we'll hear of Nightwish.  In all honesty, maybe Tuomas should just quit while he's... ahead?... and avoid the next album being the Finnish equivalent of St. Anger.<br />However, if you like Nightwish, I recommend the new albums by Leaves' Eyes (you can't get it here, you have to get it from Napalm Records or The End Records), Epica, After Forever, and Sirenia.
B00024BHTC|1.0|This album is 1 of the worst records of the decade.  Ignore the ramblings by the '5' star reviewers.  They don't know what they are talking about cause they are stupid.  I can some up Nightwish in 1 word - CRAP.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this album soo much. Brit finally did a good job. The songs are awespme and u can tell that Britney put a lot of effort into it. This album has awesome production, good beats, but despite stellar vocals on some songs. Britney may not have a good voice but shes talented at other things like dancing and making hooks and shes a good songwriter cause she wrote 7 song off the album. I dont know why people are dissin Britney. (...). Ur supposed to rate the music not her. And he probably never even heard it in his life. Sure he made a review on each song but he prob just saw a track listing of the album and just rate it without listening to it. Anyways look at Madonna or Janet jackson. They don't have good voices either and their Icons in this music business. Now what do u haters have to say about that? So anyways Get this album it has amazing songs like Toxic, Everytime, Outrageous, Breathe on me, Shadow, Brave new girl, MATM and Boom Boom. Theres only one bad song and that is EARLY MORNIN and it should have been left out of the album. But i forgive Britney for that. Shes an amzing performer. I dont know why some people compare her with Christina. Sure Christina is a good singer but thats all that she is. Shes not like Britney who awes the audience and does amazing performances. Ok Britney is better looking than Chrisitna.  Britney is a better dancer and performer. And Christina is only better than Britney at one thing: Singing. So Britney wins as always. Britney is an amzing performer and she will always will be. She will become an icon just like madonna and janet jackson. So get this album right now, u wont regret it. i promise.
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Dire Straits in its early years was a rock guitar band  highlighting Mark Knopfler's exquisite, rapid-fire guitar licks and off-beat, Dylanesque lyrics. &quot;Communique&quot; is similar but not as good as Dire Straits' exceptionally good first album. Two songs rise above the mundane to get to the almost-great category:  &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; and &quot;Portobello Belle,&quot; a catchy little number with a honky-tonk piano in the foreground and Knopfler's guitar taking a back-bench for a change. <br />&quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; is also a good tune with a loping Reggae-like beat, but I prefer the live version on &quot;Alchemy&quot; to this studio version.  As a whole, &quot;Communique&quot; is a bit too laid back and unexciting to get a top rating--but I could listen to &quot;Portobello Belle&quot; all day long.
1592400876|3.0|The writer is showing off.  There is no particular wisdom in this book, although it is rather amusing for a quick run-through.  As an English teacher, I have encountered some creative punctuation among students, and have also developed definite ideas about how punctuation should be used.  There are certainly rules, and if one learns the rules along with the grammar and usage that punctuation supports, there is no problem. Granted, almost no one but diehard purists knows the proper use of the apostrophe, but that shows only that it has been badly taught. Colons and semicolons have their own rules, and can best be conquered by avoidance. We are becoming a world of illiterates, and only the most fastidious of us will preserve the traditions that keep sentences from tumbling off the tracks like a head-on train wreck.  This book does not help.
B00000JCOV|5.0|GREAT CD! NOT FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU SIT BACK AND THINK YOUR TOUGH,COOL,AND LISTEN TO RAP ALL DAY AND WANNA BE A &quot;GANGSTA&quot; AS ALL YOU WIGGERS THINK YOU ARE ANYWAYS, YOU PROBOBALLY WONT LIKE IT,DONT BOTHER OR WASTE YOU TIME
B00025ETIW|5.0|I understand why people like this band so much because normally I don't listen to this genre, and still it's not my style but I won't deny it's a good album.
B00024BHTC|4.0|I absolutely love this album.  I have all 4 previous albums from Nightwish, and enjoy them all.  I know many people didn't like Century Child that much, but I think the songwriting on that album was very strong.  The only criticism I share is that Tarja's vocals aren't as technically impressive on their recent albums as they were on Oceanborn.  <br />I expected Once to sound much like Century Child.  It does to an extent, but due to the presence of the choir and orchestra this is easily their most symphonic-sounding album.  Listening to it, I couldn't help but visualize it as the soundtrack to some hugely epic movie.  While I love the entire album, the standout tracks for me are definitely &quot;Creek Mary's Blood&quot; which incorporates Native American chant, and &quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteililjian&quot; which is sung entirely in what I assume is Finnish (Hey, I'm not a linguist), and is an absolutely breathtaking track.<br />Very impressed.  The only thing I'd change is that I wish Tarja would show off her voice a bit more as she did on the older albums.
B00002MZ12|4.0|Alanis has created a nice Unplugged CD. It's a great recording and has the real open ambience of a live performance.<br />Some thoughts on the tracks:<br>1. You Learn   -A nice version, but not significantly different from the studio version.      <br>2. Joining You   - Beautiful vocal performance.   <br>3. No Pressure Over Cappuccino ? An interesting new song.<br>4. That I Would Be Good - GREAT song, very heartfelt. This song pulls you in and doesn?t let go.     <br>5. Head Over Feet - A nice version, but again, not significantly different from the studio version. I still think this song has one of the funniest harmonica parts ever.<br>6. Princes Familiar  A song left off of  Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. I LOVE this song. Possibly my favorite song on this album.<br>7. I Was Hoping  -Great performance.      <br>8. Ironic   A nice version, but again, not significantly different from the studio version<br>9. These R The Thoughts  A song left off of  Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie . Alanis thoughts while alone. Haunting.      <br>10. King Of Pain   - A nice version, but Alanis doesn't really make the song her own. I was hoping for more out of this one.     <br>11. You Oughta Know   A nice version, but again, not significantly different from the studio version     <br>12. Uninvited - Heartbreaking. Beatuful.
0064471837|1.0|This book got really good reviews so i thought, \\"humm this must be a worth while book.\\" Oh, how wrong was I. The plot gets sluggish and lame and really predictable. I love fantasy books, they are the best category but this book had some strange ideas and I dont know. This was the biggest waste of time. I hope someone will take my advice and when you see this book just run away.
B00005JKC3|4.0|\\"What scares me the most is that when it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control, I like it.\\"<br />--Eric Bana as Bruce Banner in \\"HULK\\"<br />I was ready to hate this film when I sat down to watch it. After the end credits rolled, the first word out of my mouth was, \\"Wow\\". I am now convinced that one of these days, Marvel Comics will fail, its luck will run out and they will make a comic book film that will fall flat on its face. With Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil and the X-Men sequel as well as the more visceral Blade series, and now, \\"Hulk\\", I don't see that happening anytime soon. And no, the doomed-to-fail-black-sheep-comic-son \\"The Punisher\\" doesn't count. I never got that comic anyhow.<br />Eric Bana plays scientist Bruce Banner who has something under his skin. Something simmers ominously, waiting to bust out of his meager frame. He is hostile towards Talbot (Josh Lucas), a man who threatens to end his project, distant from his old girlfriend Betty (Jennifer Connelly), even though he works with her, and is generally always on edge.<br />He also has horrible memory-flashes about a strange event in his childhood which includes the fate of his mother and father but much like the puzzle that is his life, he can't seem to put the pieces together well enough to solve things. What makes things worse is that he's being stalked by a strange decrepit old man who claims to be his father (Nick Nolte) who may hold the secret to everything he is.<br />It isn't until Banner is involved in a potentially dangerous accident in his lab that everything is brought to a head. Banner protects one of his colleagues but throws himself on top of a machine that is highly radioactive...and it throws him into a coma. When he awakens in a hospital and is confirmed by a doctor as completely healthy, things still don't seem to make sense. Any other human being would have been killed by exposure to Gamma radiation, and by that rationale, Banner should be dead but instead, it proves to be the missing piece of Banner's puzzle.<br />Upon another meeting with his father after his accident, his anger is suddenly unlocked. Banner gets upset...REALLY gets upset. Uncontrollaby, he transforms into a monster with incredible strength and agility and uses it to fight those who really tick him off, and that includes Talbot and Betty's father, General Ross (Sam Elliot), who want to extract his DNA and, true to \\"secret government\\" form, use it to build a race of soldiers who are indestructable and can fight forever.<br />The film is directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), who once said to an interviewer \\"I don't know how to make a comic book, but I do know how to make a Greek tragedy.\\" He lied to us...or at least he lied about not knowing how to make a comic book movie. Based on a script which includes the writing talent of comic book vets Stan Lee and the much-welcomed \\"father\\" of the \\"Hulk\\", Jack Kirby, Bruce Banner is portrayed as he should be: a conflicted human being whose fragile psyche has been traumatized left and right and who has been forever cursed with not being able to control his anger and frustrations in the beast that eventually rips things apart, causing people to loathe and fear him.<br />In this story, we get to examine, first-hand, Banner's fears, worries, hopes, and the destruction of all of the forementioned. Bana is the perfect Banner. Nerdy, but not quite nerdy, contained, but conflicted, he expresses such emotion just by letting us look into his very deep, soulful eyes. Nolte, who plays Banner's father whose concern about solving our genetic flaws outweighs his care for his son, is fantastic. Jennifer Connelly is cast perfectly as Betty Ross who just wants Banner to get past his childhood.<br />\\"HULK\\" is a triumph, a tribute to the comic book as a form of storytelling and artistic talent, with heartfelt emotion rarely seen in a genre that, until recently, has been jeered at by critics and average movie-goers who have been scarred by bombs like \\"Batman and Robin\\" and the god-awful previews of \\"Catwoman\\". It's moving and surprisingly deep. Whereas Lee could have cut to more mindless action and things getting torn apart, we get lengthly discussions about life and unwanted memories and glimpse mental battles between father and son as well as father and daughter. Everyone expresses such genuine heart, you would think that they were all given copies of the recent series of \\"Hulk\\" comic books to read before they performed.<br />The editing is brilliant and accentuates the experience. There are split-screen shots, wipes, and slide-shots that make you feel like you're watching a live-action comic. A great shot that still sticks out in my mind is when the Hulk is racing down a hallway and we see a small screen on the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. It's Talbot and he is trying to get a hold of General Ross to tell him that the Hulk is free and running loose. Ross appears in a small screen in the opposite corner. You see every scene as it happens so you don't miss anything, much like a comic. I haven't seen such inspired and creative editing like that since the first \\"Creepshow\\" film.<br />Let's hope D.C. Comics is taking notes.<br />***1/2 out of  ****<br />--Mattho have been scarred by bombs like \\"Batman and Robin\\" and the god-awful previews of \\"Catwoman\\". It's moving and surprisingly deep.

B00003CXCT|5.0|i cant believe people are whinning so much. This version will be great
0553573403|5.0|... and immediately jumped on to write this review.<br /><br />First, let me tell you my odd (maybe even queer) reading habits.<br />It took me 6 months to read to page 304. It took me 6 days to finish the book. The first 304 pages are not dry at all... very engaging. Let me describe myself:<br />1. I am not a reader of books: I do read periodicals and technical books out the wahzoo but the last book I actually sat and enjoyed was &quot;Makes Me Wanna Holler: A Young Black Man in America&quot; by Nathan McCall almost 10 years ago.<br />2. As a general rule, I loathe fantasy books despite labeling myself a hardcore fantasy roleplayer. I always felt that most fantasy books were so predictable, lacking character development and plot. Also, many faults lie with relying too much on magic, magic items, great monsters and beasts and in the end, have you really experienced anything different that you hadn't heard/read/seen before?<br />So when I tell you that this book is the one, do not be so quick to judge my lack of experience in fantasy book genre. The greatness of this book is that it deals with real characters, real character development and plots as heavy and thought provoking as you can ever experience. Best of all, it does not rely on magic, magic items, great beasts, superheroes, etc in order to tell the story.<br />Do yourself a favour, like I did, and get the entire series. You will be glad that you did.<br />When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground. - Cersei Lannister<br />Damn straight!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|OK you might think this is another hardcore/metal/emo band like atreyu,unearth,blah blah but you thinking wrong this album is amazing , amzing melodies ,choruses, solos, riffs, everythign its so good! im a metalhead not a big fan of this genre, but i heard it straight through the album really gets solid at number 4 the ones before number 4 are good but the songs all after are just pieces of art i cant explain it, the best songs are remenissions,eternal rest,second heartbeat,i wont see you tonight part 1, clairvoyant disease, buy this now, if your a metal head like myself!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film is not for everybody. The premise is not strange but it does have an exotic air to it. One reviewer here wrote something about it's lack of sensitivity towards Japan and the Japanese. I didn't see that. I saw a film about two displaced people who probably shouldn't have gone to Japan and I never was convinced that their take of the country was meant to be worldly or balanced. They were both their because of circumstances that led them there and their take was never meant to be some utopian ideal. The actor (Murray) was there because the money was too good (presumebly) to pass up. The young wife (Johanssen) was there to be with her new husband, and she did try to take in the culture and the sights. That they amused themselves in their boredom by making light of their circumstances is nothing more than a safety valved to compensate for their loneliness and apprehension about being in that alien place. As the film progressed they got out of their shells and had fun among the locals, and by the end there was no doubt that the memory of the experience would be a high mark among others which would sustain them as they continued in their lives. I really loved to see how this change came about as well as the sexless love affair that ensued (the lack of sexual intimacy put more weight into the affair making it seem somewhat more potent and on some levels more disturbing when regarding their marriage partners) within this setting of glittering towers, high tech commercial visual displays and little restaurants. The population, that was as varried as any metropolitan cities around the world, and despite the language barrier, were also the stars. The fact that Murray's character is uneasy and somewhat flippant toward his hosts is not because he's a creep. These people are just as shallow as handlers on the other side of the Pacific and my guess is that he's disappointed with that realization. I can understand that. How often are Hollywood and advertisement folks painted with a broad brush in the USA? I never hear anyone complain of that treatment. It's the character growth in this film that makes me like them despite knowing very little about them. I've been in strange places with a language barrier and it's often not very pleasant but eventually you get out, meet the strangers, eat their food, drink their beverages and do that weird pantomime with hand gestures and facial expressions, and, if you're smart, a well placed local greeting, and things are no longer very strange.One word of caution. Just because the critics like something, or, heck, even your best friend, that is no indication of whether you will like the film. Don't blame the film because you didn't like it. Their intention is to entertain people and not rob them of their hard earned cash. Next time pay attention to the previews (most filmmakers have very little say about how a film is marketed) and really read those critics' reviews and from a few sources not just one or two. For more than a few people who've reviewed this film I get the impression that they bought into the hype rather than made good individual choices.Never, never buy into the hype. While I like (putting it mildly) this film, I can't see why it was as popular as it was. It's not that kind of film. The last time I saw this happen was with \\"American Beauty\\". Another great film but not one that was a crowd pleaser. Both of these films are too layered and subtle to be popular. The viewing audience is not at fault for liking or disliking this film, but neither are the filmmakers. Chalk this up to bad communication.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|I just spent a couple of hours looking at this wonderful movie and the extra features.  The aptly named Masterpiece Edition is worth every penny, and like The Matrix, should be included in any movie collection, whether you have a child to hide behind or not.<br />Beautifully adapted and animated from Lewis Carroll's highly imaginative, high-trippin' classic, the imagery and illustrated puns amaze and amuse, especially the little things like the rocking-horse fly, the bread-and-butter flies, the vultures, the pencil and hammer birds, the momeraths, and the bird in the tree (Queenie Leonard) yelling \\"Ser-pennnnnt !\\"<br />The animators drew each frame based on the portrayals by the actors voicing the parts, and the stand-outs are Kathryn Beaumont as Alice, Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter, Verna Felton as the Queen of Hearts, Bill Thompson as the White Rabbit, and the very flexible and versatile J. Pat O'Malley as Tweedle Dum, Tweedle Dee, the Walrus AND the Carpenter, in one of the best scenes in the movie.<br />With fourteen songs, this is the most musical Disney around, but unfortunately, the songs are not very easy to sing along to, making me sound like William Hung every time I try to impress people with my thorough knowledge of the lyrics.<br />There are lots of interesting tidbits in the extras, such as the discarded Cheshire Cat song, and the fact that one of the songs was later re-worded for Peter Pan.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I rented this movie last night with high hopes --like many of you, I'm sure.  I was expecting clever dialogue; good cinematography; better-than-average acting from the magnetic, charasmatic Scarlett Johansson and dry humored Bill Murray; and, for Christ's sake, an interesting story for once in a long while.  I ended up getting very little bang for my buck, and got instead an extended, petulant MTV video.  The goal of this film was for Sophia Coppola to show us her hip-ness --not much else.<br />The dialogue --most of it between our two stars and annoying, (condescendingly portrayed) miniature Japanese people (which could've been hilarious, instead of tedious, had this 'dialogue' not eaten up half of the film)-- was not clever at all.  It rarely elicited a chuckle, much less make me think a little bit.  It was clear in the first fifteen minutes that the characters were dissatisfied with being in Japan alone, but there were so little conversations of substance between Johansson and Murray throughout the rest of the film, that I wondered how they shared the strong bond that they did.  Johansson saw Murray as a father figure of sorts, it seemed (they fondled one another like dear old pals), but I really never saw that bond materialize...  It just sort of... happened.  That got to my craw about 3/4 through the film; my respect for the characters (and their creators) had fizzled to nothing after seeing them so enlightened by hardly anything at all.<br />The cinematography was done very well, I think.  The filters used made downtown Tokyo seem so clear, vibrant and beautiful --not too bright, not too morose.  The director wielded the cameras with relative precision, not eluding to --as so many hipsters do these days-- home-video-camera wobbliness.  It was, for the most part, stable (or else I'd've turned the movie off half way through).  I was more than happy with the shots of Tokyo; if only Coppola had shown the same appreciation for the people that she did for the edifices...<br />The acting was all-around impressive.  Johansson was her typical magnetic, mellow self, and Murray played the solemn, (perhaps) washed-up actor like few others could've, I suspect.  I do not think that any of the performances were worthy of awards; but I can blame that on the writers for not exploiting the actors abilities the way they should've.<br />It is so nice to be surprised by a film which you'd heard all the buzz about, and turns out to be enlightening, alive and brilliant --a pleasant gem.  Lost In Translation was indeed not entirely what I was expecting, which CAN be good; but in this case, I was disappointed by the lack of substance that many other contemporary independent films have been successful in acheiving.
B000003S0P|5.0|This album is great, probley the best King Crimson album, I love it and can't stop listning to it.<BR>Red-An awsome song that has really cool guitar riffs and strange drum fills and beats. 5 stars.<BR>Fallen Angel-amzingly porgressive great style, probly the best song on the album. 5 stars.<BR>One More Red Nightmaire-Sorta catchey, but still veary orginal and porgressive( as we'd exspect from King Crimson ). 5 Stars.<BR>Provedence-Veary cool sounding, a bit more layed back. 4 stars.<BR>Starless-Wow.5 stars.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Don't let the people raving about what a great family movie this is scare you away...while Whale Rider is appropriate for younger ones, it is definitely aimed at a more mature audience.  Very good story, extremely moving and heartbreaking.  I cried for hours.
B00006879E|5.0|Finally, something ORIGINAL!!! This is arguably one of the best CD's released in the mainstream because it combines many styles of music from rock to jazz in order to create this wonderful sound. The lyrics are about love and heartache like a lot of artists out there, but singer Adam Levine adds his soul and personality into his songs. Songs such as &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;She will be loved&quot; displays the versatility of the band's sound, therefore making them talented. how refreshing.
0345403959|4.0|This book is a great addition to the saga; a real added bonus for those who already love Eddings' work. Its wry humour and great storytelling style make it a definite page-turner, despite a few qualms I had with Belgaraths' little 'asides' to the reader - amusing to begin with, but a few of his quips fell short with me. However, overall, an extremely enjoyable read.<BR>However, I must add a word of warning to potential readers out there. A lot of reviewers have been recommending Belgarath the Sorcerer as a good way to start on the Belgariad and Mallorean series - it IS a nice summary of the world Eddings has created but some people might want to avoid it until they have read the other series as this book reveals many of the plot-twists which, for me, made the Belgariad and Mallorean so enjoyable. Eddings' device of starting and ending this book with episodes from Garions' current life, set after Seeress of Kell, is a good idea but it means that  a new reader will quickly find out what happens to the gang in the end - if you're the kind of person who flicks to the ends of books anyway then that's alright, but if you want to save the surprises for later then don't read this book yet! A friend of mine picked up Belgarath the Sorcerer before  reading the other books and was disappointed that she then knew what was going to happen to Garion and his friends. Also, the world-building which came quite gradually in the Belgariad and Mallorean is now crammed into one book here, and I think many of the references to events in the other novels would be lost on new readers here, especially towards the end of this book when emphasis is heavily on the background of characters such as Silk, Barak and Garion.  <BR>Overall, a great book, but you'll get more out of it if you've read Eddings' previous works already!
0060730552|4.0|It's hard to believe that Touching The Void is a true story.  The level of physical exertion that is depicted in the book seems beyond anything a human could produce.  But, the searing emotions that accompany that exertion are described so movingly that a reader has no choice but to accept that this story is painfully true.<BR> <BR>The only drawback to this fascinating tale is the mountaineering minutia littering the text.  I realize that this information was presented to provide some context to the difficulty of the climb and the descent.  However, instead of informing me, this information actually bored me with its technicality.  It also added a clumsy quality to the writing that ended up disrupting the flow of the story.<br />Like The Climb by Anatoli Boukreev, Simpson makes up for his sometimes clumsy writing style by dramatically portraying the emotions he felt during this ordeal.  As a result, Simpson's story is a testament to the power of ingenuity and faith. After reading Touching The Void, it will be impossible not to have a greater appreciation for the inherent strength of the human character.
0812550706|4.0|Why You Should Read This<br />If you regard(ed) yourself as a gifted child you will find the reading cathartic. If you're a parent of a gifted child then you should regard this book as non-fiction. Anyone looking for a very good book to read over the weekend or during some other short interim of time then there are really no finer books. Ender's Game is an excellent book to give or recommend to someone unfamiliar with the genre who isn't desirous of much in the way of high-brow literature. If you've read other books by Card and are (rightly) puzzled and disgusted at his iconic status then you should give this one a try. <br />Why You Should Pass<br />There is an extraordinary amount of hype surrounding this book. Do not flip the cover open expecting to have your life changed. Have realistic expectations for what it is: a decent book with mass-market appeal. If you're looking to have your life changed or affirmed, seek other books. Do not expect heavy philosophy here, you won't find it. If you're looking for heavy philosophy likewise seek elsewhere. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM

B0001GF2DS|5.0|&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; is Sergio Leone's magnum opus. An audacious undertaking, it would have flopped miserably in any other director's hands. Only someone so commited to his artistic vision as Leone could have pulled off this bombastic pageantry of human nature in all its facets, its capacity for cynicism, greed, bloodlust, revenge, heroism, redemption and honour.<br />This movie must be *experienced.* Put the DVD in, turn the stereo all the way up and let it pummel you from the moment the Lardani titles blast onto the screen in a blaze of Technicolor fury. The montage of colour, interspersed by stark black and white visages of Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach is a tough act to follow, like Saul Bass' mesmerising titles for Hitchcock's &quot;Vertigo.&quot;<br />The wait is now over! Last year, MGM/UA issued a restored 35mm print, which showed at the Film Forum in Manhattan. First restored in Italian by Cineteca Nazionale, the English-language restoration was spearheaded by Martin Scorsese, whose efforts with the Film Preservation Foundation have helped fund preservation of America's celluloid heritage. Both Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood returned to the sound studio to dub new dialogue for approximately 20 minutes of restored footage. Both sound a little older and scratchier, but these added scenes help to explain both Tuco's and Angel Eyes' gangs and some plot points that were previously unclear. However, they both sound great! (Van Cleef's voice was dubbed by a professional voiceover artist, and sounds almost on target). The movie now has the true feel of a sprawling epic, one that's earned its right to take its time.<br />This special edition DVD features the movie restored to its original length in the Italian version, and comes jam packed with interviews with Eastwood, Wallach, producer Alberto Grimaldi and -- most importantly -- Mickey Knox, who wrote the English language dialogue. Knox crafted lines that lived up to the larger than life screenplay. You'd swear the original was in English, the dialogue is so perfectly tailored!<br />But the vision is singularly Leone's. It starts slowly, as  a band of bounty killers home in on their prey, small-time bandit Tuco Ramirez (THE UGLY, played by the venerable Eli Wallach). They pile through a saloon door, then the camera imediately pans away laterally. Suddenly, his body hurtling through the front window in a rain of glass, Tuco bursts onto the street -- in what has to be the most absurd grand entrance in screen history -- revolver in one hand, a chicken leg in the other. It's total chutzpah on Leone's and Wallach's part.<br />If you think *that* can't be topped, watch Wallach's entire performance. Animated is putting it mildly. More than a performance, Wallach is a one-man band, nay, Army. Never has such a selfish, petty, ratty and shifty little man been played so larger than life. Wallach smirks, scurries, grimaces, chuckles, shouts, bellows and slyly oils his way across the screen in what has got to be the hammiest performance ever by a method actor. Or *any* actor: He makes Orson Welles, Burt Lancaster and Charles Laughton look like the grey and sullen cast of Woody Allen's &quot;Interiors,&quot; he's so alive with passion that he literally sweats his performance out through the filthy pores on his stubble-ridden face. And he's wonderful!<br />If that's a tough act to follow, you haven't met the bad. They don't come any badder than Angel Eyes, Lee Van Cleef's hired killer who's got ice water running through his veins. Van Cleef is ruthless, bold and heartless. Riding out of nowhere onto a doomed man's rancho, Angel Eyes pays a visit, carrying out a murder for hire. The price: $500. But the victim offers him $1000 to look the other way. No dice: Angel Eyes isn't in it for the money. Rather, he's a man who loves his work, and always sees the job through. So, the poor sod dies anyway.<br />Clint Eastwood is as cool as a cucumber as The Man With No Name (but really one with sort of a name, in this case &quot;Blondie,&quot; which is Wallach's moniker for him). It's fun watching the ongoing relationship between Blondie and Tuco as bounty hunter and prey. In another life, they would have been great pals, but in this life (&quot;we're all alone in this world,&quot; Tuco confesses to Blondie, half seriously, half cynically) their love of money is thicker than friendship. So, they invent ingenious and cruel ways to exact revenge of each other.<br />It's during one of Tuco's sadistic plots - in which he marches the pale-skinned Eastwood across 100 miles of scorching desert - that the plot finally comes to a head: A driverless stagecoach full of wounded Confederates happens across their path, and through a twist of fate, Tuco and Blondie each have two halves of a secret which, if put together, will make them a quarter of a million dollars richer. But, without each other the two halves are worthless. Thus does Tuco do a 180 from brutal executioner to Blondie's would-be saviour. Now that he could be rich, he suddenly realizes how valuable their friendship is.<br />It's not before long that they wind up with Angel Eyes, as they're captured by Union soldiers. At the prisoner of war camp, a deadly game of cat and mouse begins. Van Cleef is now more restrained and less thuggish as he deals with Tuco to extract the secret; his henchman Wallace (Mario Brega, a Leone stalwart), pummels it out of Tuco.<br />In epic fashion, after a shootout in a deserted town and a bridge demolition that explodes across the screen, Tuco, Blondie and Angel Eyes make their way to the cemetery where the treasure is buried. In a fanfare of brass, percussion and chorus, the three face each other down in the cemetery plaza. It's a gorgeous and cathartic set piece. Credit must go not only to composer Ennio Morricone but also to musical director Bruno Nicolai, who conducts the score con fuoco.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album literally just made me stand up and take notice of Slipknot. Slipknot have really moved on as a band, both musically and mentally. They haven't completely done away with the shouting and swearing that everyone associates with Slipknot, but they have taken it to another level. <br />1. Prelude: Very aptly named! It really does start off the album, but not with the sort of bang that you'd think. It's quite slow and creepy with a lot of synthesisers doing some very well constructed melodies. 8/10<br />2. The Blister Exists: This is a very new approach to the original shouty and violent Slipknot. This still has elements of the good ol' stuff but is far better musically. Nice contrast to the first song. 9/10<br />3. Three Nil: Pathetic! I hate this song! It's just too pointless and unintelligable. Useless addition to an album full of brilliant songs. 2/10<br />4. Duality: Wow! Everyone has now heard the single and most people have bought this album just for this song. It is lyrically beautiful and full of interesting little guitar bridges and solos. 10/10<br />5. Opium Of The People: Lovely play on the saying &quot;opient of the people&quot; for the title. The song is very much like The Blister Exists and Duality, but still holds its own with an ace chorus! 8/10<br />6. Circle: I had to slap myself to believe that this was Slipknot. An accoustic song? Ace! It is well constrcuted and very moving. Good contender for best song on the album! 10/10<br />7. Welcome: Not bad, not good. It's just boring for me. Just shouting all the time. Yes it does show that Slipknot haven't completely changed but its one of those songs that you always skip to get to the next one. 4/10<br />8. Vermillion: The best song of all! Its amazingly dark and destructive but with actual melodies. My favourite song! 1,000,000/10<br />9. Pulse Of The Maggots: I really like this song. It's fun and utterly pointless in a good way! Its what was good about the old Slipknot! 9/10<br />10. Before I Forget: Amazing. Classic metal, grunge, rock and thrash combine to make what will no doubt become a classic Slipknot song alongside Left Behind and Wait and Bleed. 10/10<br />11. Vermillion pt. 2: Its an accoustic version of Vermillion and is brilliant. I love it! Its relaxing but at the same time dark and mysterious! 10/10<br />12. The Nameless: This is cool! It's like Opium Of The People in the fact that it has old and new combined. Good listening! 8/10<br />13. Virus Of Life: Awful! I hate it. It has no melody, no intelligible lyrics and sounds like a primary school band with a hangover! 1/10<br />14. Danger - Keep Away: Very dark, but again relaxing. Its very disturbing with the woman screaming and is an excellent way to end what is an undoubtadly brilliant album. 9/10<br />Slipknot's best album by far! Buy it! BUY IT NOW!<BR>The masks are also very cool. I just miss the gas mask guy. His new mask is crap. Too much like Corey's.
0679731725|5.0|\\"The Remains of the Day\\" is an unforgettable book. The novel tells the story of Stevens, an English butler who journeys across the English countryside to meet with an old colleague with the hope of recruiting her back to Darlington Hall. As Stevens ventures away from his workplace for the first time in decades, he finds himself reminiscing about his former employer, an unofficial English diplomat who worked to dispel European tension between the two world wars. Stevens records his recollections in the form of a journal; these journal entries comprise \\"The Remains of the Day\\".    Stevens is a haunting character, unforgettable for his obsessive desire for perfection and for the devastation this obsessiveness ultimately causes him. Ishiguro examines the question of what it means to \\"inhabit\\" the role of butler, a necessity if Stevens is to perform his job properly. To be a good butler requires Stevens to show no emotion, but he lives at Darlington Hall and is never off-duty, meaning that he rarely gets the chance to \\"disrobe\\" and consider his own needs. Consequently, when afforded the opportunity to leave home by his new employer, an American businessman, Stevens allows the role of butler to fall away ever so slightly. The result is a conflicted account of the major events of Stevens' employment: recollections of Lord Darlington both confident of his decency and undermined by doubt.    Ishiguro also examines the question of \\"dignity\\": whether working for a man of apparent \\"greatness\\" makes Stevens great by extension, or whether it is instead pathetic to surrender so much control. Stevens confronts this question head-on in the book's final pages, in a scene on a pier that will stay with you indefinitely.    Then there is, of course, Miss Kenton. A maid at Darlington Hall during most of Stevens's tenure there, Miss Kenton is the person we want Stevens to be: committed to her work but willing to assess the politics of her employer. Through their mutual responsibility forthe operations of the household, Stevens and Miss Kenton develop feelings for one another. Miss Kenton reveals her affection through teasing and gentle nosiness, and Stevens responds with awkwardness and, more often, strictness. When Stevens meets Miss Kenton toward the end of the book, his new self-awareness allows us to finally understand the vitality of their relationship and to feel the devastation of its lost potential.    \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is my favorite present to give, and I get jealous of friends reading it for the first time. Kazuo Ishiguro is a masterful author, and you will wonder why it took so long for a book like this to be written. Its scenes and narrator will both stay with you vividly.
0553278398|3.0|This book wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. I never felt bored, and all the characters were mildly interesting. However, the story did seem a bit contrived, and as always, Asimovian logic doesn't make sense at times. However, I did enjoy all the exposition in the book, which is rare for science fiction. A book that has an exciting plot AND good dialogue is hard to find. I also enjoyed the twists at the end, which I didn't see coming.<br />All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book to any sci-fi fan, but it was an enjoyable read.
0553382179|5.0|I haven't yet ordered her book, but if her website is anything to go by the book is an must read.  She has taught thousands of people how to get their living spaces under control but her advice can be applied to all areas of life.  A core element of her methods is teaching a person how to FLY (finally loving yourself) - so important for the disorganised person who has spent their life feeling a failure.  I guess anyone that doesn't find her methods useful obviously hasn't been willing to try them properly or doesn't need help with organising their life.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Wonderful artists recorded with Barbra and what wonderful performances... Any listener familiar with Barbra, knows that every track she records is perfected to beyond perfection.  Those of us lucky enough to have lived through these years of Barbra's duets remember how exciting it was when they hit the charts.. <BR>   I would highly recommend this fabulous collection.. In truth..any recording Barbra has released would be highly recommend.. She is simply the worlds greatest artist..
B00003CXAA|5.0|While the original film ranked #2 on the AFI's list of 100 Greatest Movies (#1 being Citizen Kane), many film buffs, afficionados, and audiences believed that the first Godfather film deserves that #1 spot.  How many people do you know who know some of those famous quotes like, &quot;I'm gonna' make him an offer he can't refuse,&quot; or &quot;Never take sides against the family again, ever...&quot;  A few maybe?  Or perhaps you grew up in an Italian family like mine and your father can translate the Italian for you while you watch?  Now how many people can quote Citizen Kane beyond, &quot;Rooooosebuuuud....&quot;<br />Despite the excellence of the first film, it is my opinion that Godfather part 2 delves deeper into the family, more into the two-toned life that Michael Corleone orchestrates between the family business and his family.  Nowhere is this more apparent than with the relationship he cultivates between himself and Hyman Roth (wonderful performance by Lee Strasberg), cementing the old adage that you keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  On the surface they are friends, behind closed doors they are co-conspirators, between each other they are close friends and confidants.  Beneath it all, in the depths of each man's heart, they are mortal enemies, Corleone ultimately the victor.  The whole movie is a mounting tension between the two, reaching heights as when Hyman fumes over the death of a great man, Mo Green, whom Corleone had killed in the first film.  In the end, Hyman becomes just another victim, mowed down by a Corleone footman.<br />The court proceedings are shot in a way that transmits the claustrophobia and morose tedium of the justice system back in the days of McCarthyism (the eras align somewhat, both post-war 1950's).  The court is crowded, people line the walls, journalists write furiously in the heat of the courtroom, in the background, people walk in and out of the proceedings like is was a Wal-Mart.  People speak into microphones, their voices drone in the hollow, sparse room.<br />And then Michael Corleone has his own brother killed.  Many would say this is when Michael gives himself over fully to the title &quot;Godfather.&quot;  This is actually one of the central themes of the first film, when exactly does Michael become Godfather?  The first film has a wonderful moment where, in the family office (the predominant colors are brown and orange), Brando gets out of his chair, moves over to the side of the office, Michael gets up from the couch on the other side, moves to the desk, and sits in his fathers chair.  This is when Michael becomes Godfather in my opinion, but Coppola is good enough to give us more moments that question exactly, &quot;When?&quot;<br />Coppola's film legacy lies within this box set, as does Pacino's, Brando's, Caan's, and Duvall's.  DeNiro managed to go off and do other things, his legacy lies somewhere else, but to the aforementioned actors, they have never done another film or role as well as what they did in the Godfather films.  You don't realize it until you pop in the bonus disc, but composer's Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola also put their legacy into this film with the music.  Who can forget Rota's seven-note theme that opens and closes the film?  Carmine Coppola adds a more Italiano flavor to the music in the flashback scenes featuring DeNiro as a young Vito Andolini (a.k.a. Don Corleone in the first film).<br />There's so much to go over, the least of which is film #3.  But the contents of the other three discs justifies the cost, which could actually be higher.  But really, this collection is an offer you can't refuse, or do I have to put a gun to your head??
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I bought this DVD yesterday and have already watched it about 5 times!

Believe 9/10    Every song in the show is a classic but nothing can beat Cher's performances of 'Just Like Jesse James', 'The Shoop Shoop Song', and 'If I Could Turn Back Time'. The 'Sonny & Cher' montage is a nice stroll down memory lane as are the montages showing Cher's movies and and other things including her Oscar win for 'Moonstruck'.    The special features are also very entertaining and include a behind the scenes look at the tour, Cher's special version of 'West Side Story', and the 2003 re-edit music video for 'If I Could Turn Back Time'.    This is a must have DVD for any Cher fan young or old, the only bad thing about it is that it is her farewell tour!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|For those who \\"got\\" this movie, I initially wonder what one has to smoke to like this one? Then I realize they actually have not smoked enough, not seen enough movies so to say.<BR>I've read previous reviews of both sides... those who can see what this movie really is - ball of nothing, are the type who typically watched lots of movies, esp. independent and foreign. On the contrary, those who love this movie are the ones probably not seen enough movies.<BR>So you go figure. <BR>Then another fellow reviewer is probably right: do yourself a favor, go out and watch more movies. After you watch 50 of top-notch independent movies, come back to &quot;lost in translation&quot;, you probably get lost too...<BR>Well the thing is you may not hear other indes as much since they probably don't have such strong marketing/publicity as &quot;lost in translation&quot; or not that many wooing critics (God knows what they wooing for) to start with.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|If you've never seen this and are getting it on DVD, watch the Theatrical Cut!  The Director's cut is horrible.  The movie is ruined by the way the ending is changed.  Theatrical ending is better.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|It's been a long time since a film has been so over rated particularly with regard to one of the lead actors, Sean Penn. Whatever gave Hollywood the notion that Sean Penn is a great actor is beyond me. A great actor he is not. An actor of sustance he is not. And actor who knows how to crawl into the skin of the character he is portraying so well that all we see is the character and not the actor up there on the screen. (Tim Robbins, by the way, does this magnificiently!) In only one respect is Mr. Penn a great actor  ... he knows the right body language to use in order to push the right buttons and manipulate the audience not by any in-depth, \\"get into the skin\\" portrayal of a character but by means of knowing the right way to scrunch up his face, contort his body, \\"act\\" drunk, \\"act\\" mean, \\"act\\" angry, \\"act\\" anything. But then this is what make Hollywood what it is -- a total illusion. The film itself is ok if you like plodding -- and plodding it is to the point that sometimes it just stops and starts up again in another plodding directon. Sure it's filled with twists and turns and all that good stuff that make for a decent mystery. But the book is better.  Some fine acting, on the other hand, by Marcia Gay Harding, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney. Interestingly enough Mr. Eastwood chose to give small, but memorable, parts to two of the most talented actors in the business -- Kevin Conway (Theo) and Eli Wallack (liquor store owner). As for Mr. Penn, Clint Eastwood did him a favor by surrounding him with a good supporting cast whose presence alone no doubt helped shield any viewer from noticing how bad Penn really is. Coming out from under the spotlight of Modana did nothing for him. He's still playing at being an actor.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|sure, she is famous. but she never wrote one single song in four albums. maybe a couple co/writing. but by real musician standars, that is sad. and why in gods name can't she sing live. i have only seen her sing one song live. everything else is lip syncing. i know she has all those dance moves to perform, but x-tina and madonna do that and sing. brit's voice is just soo weak, she never sings high notes, she never &quot;belts&quot; out a tune, not even on studio tracks. i won't say the songs aren't fun and bubble-gummish. but they are not meant to be rock classics. really once you grow up , you will get rid of her cds, embarassed that you ever owned them.
055357342X|5.0|Judging by the brick-size of 'A Storm of Swords', I was momentarily afraid that Martin had began the 'Jordanization' of his awesome series. The first 800 pages did nothing to alleviate my fears. Although the novel was a fun ride through the first two thirds, I got the feeling that not much was moving. I was afraid the novel would leave me with no discernable change by the time it was over.<br />Boy... Was I ever wrong!! If you pick this novel and are slightly put off by the slow (although well-written) pace of the beginning, trust me: get through it. By the end of the novel, things have picked up so much, I was wishing Martin would slow down a little and let me catch my breath.<br />To put it as plainly as I can without giving away anything, a LOT happens in the last third of 'A Storm of Swords'. A lot of it is characterized by Martin's implaccable 'logic is stronger than fairy tales' brand of storytelling. A lot of it, also, is so daring, so unpredictable, that I had to stop many times in shock to digest what I had just read.<br />If you liked the first two books in the series, don't hesitate one second to pick up this one. Chances are the fine writing and your beloved characters will get you through the first 800 pages without a problem, but if you ever tire of the slow pace, rest assured: by the end, you'll wish things weren't so darn fast.<br />For its daring, fine writing and excellent political scheming, 'A Storm of Swords' is actually better than its precedessors. I really can't wait for 'A Feast for Crows'.
B00003CXB4|1.0|I wish I had read the review here warning that this movie is not appropriate for young viewers.  I just assumed that a modern Disney movie would not have this level of violence.  I also just have to comment that I found the animation, the story, the script and especially the music to be far below the quality I would expect from Disney.  I know most disagree but I really don't get it!  The music is formulaic 1990's drivel without any creativity.  Despite the violence, it was phenomenally slow and hard to care about any of the characters.  My son was so bored he only made it through half the movie before wandering off to do something more exciting.

To my delight plus surprise, this book is great, definiteltly better than  Deception Point which the last scene of attempting to rescue the heroin from the Triton reads like fake, and too cliche. <br />It is believable that TRANSLTR could break a 64-bit key or crack a 128-bit key in less than 6 hours, because it is a parallel computing machine of millions of processors. <br />As great as Da Vinci Code but less filling.
B000002GQE|5.0|I felt in love with this album. Zhe songs of The Moody Blues are great, but the music of the London Festival Orchestra, who went this album into a concept album, is the BEST!!!

B0000DD7LB|2.0|I'll admit. I find many of Britneys tunes to be catchy and fun on her albums. This album is no different. However, I hate to say it but Brit should stick to dancing and not singing. Her voice sounds so artificial that it is almost insulting. No matter how beautiful a song could be, she has that trademark nasalness that continues to ruin her music. She should stick to something she has talent in, which is dancing, and stop morphing her weak voice into some wierd computer sounds.
B00008H2LB|5.0|The &quot;debut to sophomore album&quot; theory goes that musicians have their whole loves to pen their debut album and a relatively short time to follow it up.  With the highest of expectations and pressure on their backs, Linkin Park came out of the studio with a magnificent Sophomore album, proving themselves and escaping the pressures of the sopomore album jinx.  The finished product titled &quot;Meteora&quot; was nothing less than brilliant.  <br />Below are the songs in which each memeber shines the brightest:<BR>Mike Shinoda/MC-  Lyrical flow in &quot;Lying from You&quot; and &quot;Faint&quot; is magnificent.  Mike also wrote the lyrics and to and composed the masterpiece &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;<br />Rob Bourdon/Drummer- Drum intro on &quot;Faint&quot; and throughout &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;.  Listen closely to &quot;Easier to Run&quot;, as his drumming is phoenominal.<br />Phoenix/Bassist- Foot tapping bass on &quot;Session&quot; and noticable flow on &quot;From the Inside&quot; is very creative.<br />Mr. Hahn/DJ- Intro scracthes in &quot;Don't Stay&quot; done on his first attempt, but shines brightest during &quot;Session&quot;.<br />Chester Bennginton/Vocals- Shows the passion in his vocals in &quot;Easier to Run&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;.  Superb aggression in &quot;From The Inside&quot; and &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;<br />Brad Delson/Guitars- Chorus of &quot;Lying From You&quot; and intro to &quot;Figure.09&quot; are quite catchy.  Incredible job on his part.<br />If you loved Hybird Theory and Renanimation, you won't be dissapointed with Meteora.  Now go get it.<br />-Randa

0684833395|4.0|Catch 22 is a story set during World War II. A significant choice for what is, ostensibly, an anti-war satire, since that particular war was a universally popular one butressed by high moral motivations. But that is the point, for Catch 22 is not simply a lampoon of war, but a searing indictment of man's spiritual crisis in the modern world.<br />On all fronts, the main character, Yossarian, is assailed by the dehumanized absurdities of mondern life, manifested most concretely in that perfected science of death, modern warfare. Yossarian, like all of us, is chained by rationality that has been stripped of reason, engineered thus for the purpose of control. That is the essence of Catch 22. <br />The character of Milo Minderbinder represents the cold, opportunistic thinking of the corporate world, dead as it is to humanistic concerns in its tireless pursuit of profit and power. Chaplain Tappman embodies the impotence and self-doubt common to many people of faith who feel adrift in a culture of materialisticly driven insanity. But it is Yossarian's wanderings through Rome, the Eternal City, and as such, the representation of modern &quot;civilized&quot; society, that is the coup de grace. It is a moonlit, poetic scene lamenting the spiritual and humanistic decay and ultimate bankruptcy of modern Western society. Simply powerful stuff.<br />Properly speaking, Catch 22 is more a series of vignettes or short stories rather than a novel. But it is told with a humor that bristles with moral outrage. While not perfect, it is an excellent read, and definitely recommened.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This film should be placed under the horror category (...).  I don't care what the subject is, or the message being conveyed; this is simply a bucket of blood movie.  As a civilized person, I was sickened by this horror.

1592400876|5.0|This book is wonderful, and needed to be written! It's obvious that for some reason, the average person has completely forgotten the rules of grammar he/she was taught as a child. Someone needed to point this out, and that's exactly what Lynn Truss did when she wrote this clever little book about punctuation. As Ms. Truss points out, it is disheartening and discouraging that even movie titles (&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot;, anyone??) are grammatically incorrect these days. It's like no one cares anymore, or cares to know, that there are rules that cannot just be ignored. Maybe, just maybe, this will make people more aware of this problem and they will make more of an effort from now on. It's really not that difficult, and haven't we all been &quot;dumbed down&quot; enough? Thank you so much, Ms. Truss, for this book! The world needs it!!
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|The debut album for Franz Ferdinand is a lot of fun and I particularly enjoy listening to it. The main problem I have is after 4 songs you begin to notice that all of the songs have the exact same drum beat and disco cool punk guitar riffs. Yeah it sounds good, but it is not nearly as inventive and fresh as the head reviewer promotes it as. At least switch things up a bit. It's light, fun, but lacking the motivation to move beyond that. I look forward to a future release when we will see if something new comes to light.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased, period.  If you Like any bands like mudvayne, or ill ni&ntilde;o, or chaimara, or spineshank, or any metal at all, really-- this is a great CD.  Yes, their sound HAS changed a bit, but it is definatly for the better.  And the song 'The Blister Exhists' is one of the best songs I have ever heard-- even better than Duality, and definatly THE BEST Slipknot song-- which makes sense, since this is indeed their best CD yet.
6300216209|5.0|After reading the book &quot;Love Story&quot; and sobbing about the ending of the of the book when Jenny dies, I wasn't quite normal for a few days, the story just stuck in my mind. I knew that there was a movie based on the book out there and about a month after reading the book I saw the movie. To be brutally honest the movie didn't have the punch and the emotion that the book had had on me. It just seemed kind of choppy, like somebody was going scissor happy in the editing room in 1970. I am not going to say anything about the acting because who am I to give acting directions. I just want to say that we should feel that way the actors portraying the characters feel, and obviously I did because I felt totally disconnected with the characters.{okay, after seeing th movie I found out that Erich Segal had actually written the screen play before actually writing the book} I don't feel that it would be an insult to say that there should be a remake of the movie &quot;Love Story&quot; because with the technology and the acting skills of today's actors, producers and directors and what not, it could be great. I watched &quot;Love Story&quot; because my dad said it was his favorite movie of all time and that it's the only movie he's ever went to the theatre to watch twice, so I thought that it really had to be a good movie. I did like &quot;Love Story,&quot; even though I wouldn't call it one of my favorite movies of all time....I'm more the action, sci-fi, comedy, and horror movie type. <BR>&quot;Love Story&quot; is good because it seems realistic, just like two normal people who are real different from each other might act in a real life relationship. Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw brought their acting skills and used them in this love story of a movie. If you like love stories, I recommend purchasing &quot;Love Story.&quot;

B000244EMO|5.0|This has got to be one of the coolest monster movies ever made! The cast is great and the creature is THE coolest (technologically advanced) alien ever! Don't listen to the 2 bad reviews. One of those guys can't even spell a simple word like \\"cigar\\", I doubt he has much taste in movies if he can't pass high school english. It's ironic that all of the low scores (besides the two drop-outs) are given not because of the movie, but because of the poor DVD treatment Fox has given it so far. I can only hope that the upcoming Alien Vs Predator will be as good as it looks. It's been a long time coming and they had better not screw it up. Anyway, get this movie. Just make sure you wait for the spec. edition coming out July 23rd!  Go Yautja!

It's alright to not like a band but the endless bagging of Jet i've witness is ridiculous.<br />All I've got to say is don't dismiss this band because people with a holier than thou attitude say they are fake. There's some good stuff on this album.

B0001XALTG|5.0|I love this. At first it's shocking, and yes a little difficult to understand but concentrate for a little while and you'll pick it up, it is in English afterall.  I've also read the book (absolutely amazing) and I have to say that I think the adaptation was done really well considering the length and depth of the story line and all the characters.<br />Now just a correction... this film is set in SCOTLAND not Ireland... as it states that Renton goes into &quot;the worst bathroom in SCOTLAND&quot; not to mention the references to Scottish cities and of course Renton's tirade about how horrible it is to be Scottish.... but i suppose if some people weren't so busy reading the subtitles they might have actually gotten the chance to watch the film.... <br />But seriously it is definitely worth seeing, it's dark, funny, raw and very NOT hollywood infested.. :o)
0385510438|3.0|For the most part, I found this entertaining. I was troubled by one thing, though:<br />The killer sneaked into the victim's house and hid in her closet, surprising her when she opened the closet door. He blindfolded her with a scarf, and cut her panties off with a knife before raping her at knifepoint. He made enough noise to awaken her small children, who came to see what was wrong. When the killer realizes the kids are there, he reacts, and the victim calls out the the kids to run. They run to the next-door neighbor. In the meantime, the killer has been recognized, and he slashes the victim's throat and flees. The neighbor goes to investigate and finds the victim, who has tried to follow the kids and collapsed. Before she dies, she tells him the name of the killer. The children are in shock and are eventually taken to live with realtives. They are too small to testify. <br />Now, some of this, like the scarf, the closet, cutting the panties could have been discovered during the investigation. But, when the DA cross-examined the killer, he knew things that only the killer, the victim and the children would have known, like that the victim had called to the children to run. The killer was, of course, denying that he was even there. The victim died before she could say more than who did it. The children were too traumatized to tell what they had see. So how, exactly, did the DA know?

Coldplay, Radiohead, Morrissey, Starsailor,  and TRAVIS are in there. For moments you think, wow, sounds original and next second you think oh no is morrissey!, oh no, now sound like travis!, suddenly sounds like like keane!, and next second sounds like coldplay. looks like if you take a juice extractor, put a cd from artist of above and there is. a mixing of all. genious right, but finally its a copy. final comments: good album, good copy. keane know how to plagiarize. by the way, keane don't have a guitar player...good pont...my last question, what the hell is keane?
6305428042|5.0|If you grew up where I grew up, Halloween was THE biggest event of the year - and all these years later, I still love the sights, smells and spirit of that most magical night.      In Hocus Pocus, you might not find true horror, blood and guts, body parts and roaming zombies (um, wait...), but you do feel the gorgeous allure of the season through the crunchy-leafed scenery, the exquisite set design, costuming, innocence of youth and the somewhat corny (if not over-acted) witchy zeal of the wonderful Sanderson sisters.  Okay, the plot wouldn't win a Pulitzer Prize, but for sheer fun and enjoyment, let Hocus Pocus transport you to a time and place where witches ruled and moms still impersonated Madonna in cone cupped bustiers.  PS: Did I mention I have my own black cat named Thackery Binx?
B00024BHTC|1.0|I don't know what this reviewers is on, but to describe this album as the best thing going is very naive.  Nightwish are probably one of the worst metal bands ever.

0375703764|4.0|This may be the most complicated book I've ever read. There are layers upon layers and you can never be sure what's real and what isn't.<br />I won't say it's the best book I've ever read, but it's certainly the most ambitious and creative. The way the typography was used alone is unlike anything I've ever seen. It could have been simply a gimmick, but it really reflects the story as well. <br />A quick hint to people who like to read while doing something else--this is NOT the book for it. I took it with me to the gym and tried to read it while riding an exercise bike. Not a pretty sight.
B0001US62I|5.0|Let's see. A mesmerizing Mickey Rourke in his element. A brief but blood-curdling cameo from DeNiro sporting overgrown fingernails, dark flowy suits and a baritone drawl. A starkly bold turn from the beautiful Lisa Bonnet who exudes sexual abandon..<br />Cut to the chase, Angel Heart is a  riveting psychothriller with cojones. It absolutely boggles me, then, why this is not the cult classic that it so richly deserves to be!<br />What begins as a fairly innocuous sleuthing adventure quickly takes on the contours of a supernatural drill, replete with mythological and biblical symbolism, as our private-eye discovers the true nature of his horrifying engagement.<br />Trevor Jones' riveting score and Parker's immaculate direction could be some of the reasons why this grand nightmare lingers in your thoughts long after the credits have rolled, but whatever the motivation, I highly recommend getting a hold of this classic with an unforgettable twist.

B000286RZM|5.0|Being a die-hard fan of John Frusciante and the Chili Peppers, I was expecting great things from &quot;The Will to Death&quot;. I received a treat. John has matured greatly over the years with his music, and this album shows it. Every song is beautiful, honest, and compelling with every strum of the guitar, every lyric that is sung, and every drum that is struck. He set new limits with his diverse style of music. He broke the mold with songs like, &quot;The Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Days Have Turned&quot;, &quot;Far Away&quot;, and &quot;The Will to Death&quot;. You will be swept away by it's beauty. Josh Klinghoffer was a great addition on the drums. John even played the bass on the song, &quot;Far Away&quot;, and he was pretty impressive. John's talent can go so far. By this album. You will fall in love with it.
0440178002|5.0|I know this is an old book by contemporary standards, but I just read it.  WOW!  I became one with the book as Blackthorne, and the story and all the love and excitement and you name it.  I could hardly put it down.  Such a wonderful story if you don't get caught up in the historical facts of the time, which the book is obviously based upon. <br />I was once a seafarer myself. I just became Blackthorne as I read the story, and I found myself loving Mariko too. How could could any man not???  hehe.  Such a wonderful story of deceit, hate, brothership, obedience, love and hate, savagry and brutality, and just a new awakening to an Englishman who knew nothing of wordly life other than that of his loving England and his life on the high seas. I was just lost in the story.  I wish I could meet a woman like Mariko today.  Such a most wonderful and beautiful woman in fiction. I wish I could find one who exists today. If they only did, WOW!!! hehe???  <br />I recommend this book to anyone who is a romantic and loves a good yarn and is not upset by some of the violence and pictures of brutality.
B00003CX8U|5.0|What a dazzlingly engaging experimentation with the medium of film as we take an evocative peep into the life of a showbiz-obsessed director Fosse -- the hedonistic man behind the actual stage version of \\"Chicago.\\"<br />Apart from being a truly sexy turn-on of a musical, it hits one out of the park as an exploration of an artist at war with himself. Somewhat indulgent, yes, but it is the brutally honest potrayal of the many imperfections (girls, gin, glitz) of a perfectionist, in all his triumphs and trials, that makes this film a very, very endearing experience.<br />The bleak undertones may scare the faint-hearted but for them there's all the riveting stage action. A wholesome film that belongs in your own collections, not just in your Blockbuster records.
0064407667|4.0|A very interesting, original story about all the bad things that happen to the 3 Baudelaire children. I absolutely loved the way this book was written and seems to flow smoothly.<br />However, I think that some of the situations in the book were depressing, and may be scary for very young children. Otherwise this book was wonderful, and I found myself rooting for the Baudelaire children, and despising Count Olaf and his friends.
B00005B1EX|5.0|Live Insurrection is a double album of live material performed by Rob Halford and his Halford band which can stand proudly alongside the legendary live Judas Priest albums Unleashed In The East and Priest...Live!  Actually, one could argue that this may even be a bit better than the afformentioned Priest discs due to such a large quanity and wide variety of music being played from so many years (1976-2001) not to mention Rob sounding more talented and invigorated than ever before; he still has all the vocal range and power and the massive supply of energy that he had before and now his voice often has a really raw, raspy sound that just makes him sound even more menacing.  His band is excellent as well, not quite Judas Priest but still total professionals.  Every song on here is a winner with basically all of them sounding better than the original studio recordings.  The Fight material (Into The Pit, Nailed To The  Gun) is an especially major improvement on the originals.  The  Judas Priest material on here sounds as exciting as it ever was; listen to the second guitar solo on Tyrant and you'll swear Glenn Tipton was up on stage playing lead with them.  The two songs I think are the undisputed all time classics of Live Insurrection are Made In Hell and Silent Screams.  Other material from Halford's Resurrection album is here (Ressurection, Cyberworld, Saviour, The One You Love To Hate with Bruce Dickinson) and it all rules but those two songs are among some of the best that Rob has ever written and on here they become two of the best metal songs ever recorded.  Made In Hell is a heavy, midpaced banger with an awesome intro riff and killer chorus and is one of the best odes to the history of heavy metal music ever.  Silent Screams - I'm not gonna say anything about, you just have to hear it to believe it - could stand proudly alongside a shortlist of Judas Priest's greatest songs, in my opinion.  There are three solid studio cuts at the end of disc two - Screaming InThe Dark is solid speed metal not unlike the stuff on the Painkiller album and Heart Of A Lion and Prisoner Of Your Eyes are re-recorded versions of then unreleased Judas Priest songs, both are great.  Every Judas Priest fan must have this CD.  Anyone who wants to hear live heavy metal at its best, buy this, you won't regret it.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|After seeing the movie, I was without words to describe my disappointment with the movie. Seeing the comments and reviews on Amazon, I am without words as to how people could be giving such an awful movie 5, 4 or even 3 stars. It is phony from start to finish, with a terrible plastic feeling throughout. It has the most stupid script ever, jokes that are simply not funny, and the bottom line is the I just could not believe someone actually released this movie to the theaters. I simply cannot put into words how deep my disappointment is.
B00000099Y|5.0|I know no one will ever read this. I don't care. This is my favorite cd EVER aside from Pink Floyd's Animals. Those two NEVER leave my changer. Tool, I fear, will never make another cd like this, much like the Deftones will never make another Adrenaline. Unfortunate as this thought is, it is made &quot;all better&quot; by the fact that this great recording is made immortal through the blessing that is the compact disc. Tool is most excellent...they are, I feel, the Pink Floyd of this acursed generation, melding their album art with the music. Cam De Leon is now one of my favorite artists, along with, Giger, Dali, Escher, and none other than Tool's own Adam Jones. In short, Tool's ultimate opus lies in this album. Most excellent.
B00009Z574|1.0|After reading the previous reviews, I felt compelled to relisten to this album. I had not heard it since first getting it back in the late 70's. I recall it being not just a little disappointing, but an absolute disaster. Something by which to be embarrassed. I was not wrong. This is an album that can be best described by three words, which are and I quote: stink stank stunk. And I don't mean just a bad Yes album, but a bad album for anybody, (except maybe Styx or Journey or another of those late 70's crap bands). How can anyone give it more than a few stars???  It's trite; Don't Kill The Whale. It's ridiculus: Arriving UFO, Circus of Heaven. It's stupid: the fake live sounds in release. One OK song: Silent Wings of Freedom. Please, let's not make this out to be any better than the crap it is.
0061091480|5.0|This book is one of the best books, perhaps even the best book I've ever read in terms of gaining control over one's life. It is truly empowering in the best sense of the idea. It comes down to the fact that you are a &quot;choice making individual&quot;. No matter what the situation is that comes up you can still choose how to react to it. <br /> To illustrate... I used to believe that I had certain tendencies (like &quot;worrying&quot; about all the &quot;what ifs&quot; for example) that were somehow out of my control. The idea of buying into the idea that some things were just &quot;family traits&quot; that I was helplessly born into, that &quot;we come from a family of neurotic people who worry&quot;.<br /> I have a particular favorite story which is on the audio tape version of the book (I can't remember if it's in the printed version of the book.... the audio seems pretty much like he's extemporizing on the principles outlined in the book). He tells of how he was in a restaurant and the manager/owner of the restaurant is getting very upset and emotional at an employee. Dr. Dyer says to the guy something like &quot;Look at yourself, you're going to give your self a heart attack by the time your fifty&quot; to which the gentleman replies &quot;I am fifty two and I had a heart attack two years ago&quot; to which Dr. Dyer says something like &quot;Then why do you do this to yourself ? &quot; to which the fellow says &quot;What do you want from me.... I'm Italian !&quot; ..... as if that was an explanation for why he was getting himself all worked up.<br />  Wayne really helps one realize that they don't have to &quot;buy into&quot; feeling like they are helpless victims of their cultural background, family dynamics and, Genetic tendencies etc. While these may all seem to be the same thing there are in fact subtle differences between them.<BR>  <BR> I have recommended this book and it's audio version for countless people who have felt &quot;out of control&quot; oftheir emotions.<br /> The ideas in this book really work if you are willing to finally let go of the mental crap in your life that is holding you back from being happier and healthier in every way. This is not to put on Rose Colored glasses, but to be able to &quot;catch yourself&quot; before you go into reacting the way you &quot;always do&quot; and really asking yourself if it is necessary.<br /> Of course there are things in life where &quot;worry&quot; (for example if a loved one is ill) might be an unavoidable and compassionate emotion. But I'm talking about the sort of &quot;worry&quot; that is about things that &quot;might happen&quot;. How many people spin endless tales of woe that will never come to pass.<br /> Regarding Waynes other work, much of it has gone the way of the worst sort of New Age thought.<br /> While I personally think that there is much New Age thinking that can be beneficial (especially in terms of having people more accepting of others rather than being narrow minded and bigotted),  often it seems to be used to avoid having compassion (as in the idea that &quot;Everything is perfect&quot; so why help starving people). <br /> This being said, &quot;Erroneous Zones&quot; is still one of those books I will always recommend and re-read (or listen to) when I find myself slipping into old mental habit patterns.<br /> Another book along these lines that I also highly recommend is &quot;Full Catastrophe Living&quot; by Jon Kabot Zinn.

0930289528|4.0|In the early 1980's, Alan Moore (Watchmen, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, From Hell, chances are if you're reading this you know the list) began this chilling work.  In an alternate world, it's 1997, and America and the Soviets have nuked each other to extinction.  England is left, now under a fascist regime, and everything seems to be under control, until a mysterious terrorist, wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and calling himself V, begins picking off government officials and destroying buildings and monuments.  Moore's storytelling is nothing short of chilling; from the basic element of the loss of freedom to a totalitarian government to just who really fights for good (is it V or the government?), V For Vendetta is nearly unforgettable.  That combined with David Lloyd's ultra eerie washed out color art make this one of the most chilling works in the world of comics you'll ever likely find.  It's not as profound or as important as Moore's Watchmen or his Swamp Thing run, but this is still worth reading.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Alright Slipknot has been my fav band for a long time now and let me tell u this is an excellent CD. But I am gettin pissed about how all the new fans say this is the best Slipknot CD ever. IT IS NOT THE BEST SLIPKNOT CD. Get over it. The Self-titled kicks Vol. 3's ass to the curb and rips its friggin guts out. This is still a kick ass CD but stop sayin its the best because it is far from it. U newer fans dont know wat ur talkin about.
B00008EYA5|3.0|Based on the 70's cop drama TV show, S.W.A.T. is pure slickly produced mainstream action fluff of the highest degree.  Beginning with a rebellious and disgraced SWAT member (Colin Farrell) who is picked to join a new squad (which includes Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Brian Van Holt, and Josh Charles) by a fresh out of retirement sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson).  Soon afterward, the head of a European drug cartel (Unfaithful's Oliver Martinez) is captured and offers 100 million dollars to whoever breaks him out of prison, and the crew ends up having their hands full when anyone and everyone comes out of the woodwork to claim the bounty.  The film looks great and his some great action scenes, and the cast is nicely assembled, but it's an ultimately shallow experience.  If you're a mainstream action fan, this is worth a look, but there's better, more character driven action films out there that are more than worth your time.
B000002JR8|5.0|I was greatly inspired by this CD to start playing the guitar. The riffs are amazing. I don't think I've ever heard a better metal guitarist than Dimebag. Pantera isn't even my favorite band (Slipknot is, but Pantera is definitely up there). Anyone who says this CD has no talent should slit their wrists and die! Definitely my personal favorite Pantera album. Buy It, you won't be dissapointed!
B0001ENY6M|3.0|Personally, I think the best song out of all of them was used for the movie trailer because it had a similar emotional impact the way the Gladiator soundtrack did. I have yet to see the movie myself, but what attracted me the most was the music. After listening to it, sometimes it's a hit and miss to the ears. Previous reviews I've read either rave about it, or think that it's a piece of recycled crap. It's neither in my opinion. The tracks each have their own distinct method which I'm sure was meant to enhance the scenes of the movie instead of overshadow them. Some songs I liked, others not so much (because they lacked impact). I'd highly suggest listening to the entire track in bits and pieces before buying it. Personally, I don't think it's as bad of a soundtrack as certain people are reviewing it to be. However, it's not the greatest. It has yet to compare to Gladiator's phenomenal soundtrack.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I will give the jets a compliment- There music is pretty catchy and the instrumentals are very decent, if not well put together. The vocals are not all that good, they can sing better than me- not that that is saying much. I would have rated the band 3 stars, if they had better lyrics that were more original, creative and deep. I mean- Are you gonna be my girl and Rollover D.J, come on guys don't you have anything better to sing about? Well the one thing that I despise of is that when you listen to The Jets for a long time it starts to disgust you how sexist they are! Some of the comments they make really makes me lose respect for them.\\"Well it's a 123 take my hand and come with me.Is it cause you look so fine that i really wanna make you mine?I said you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.\\" That just sounds really offensive, is he talking about a prostitute? Very disrespectful to women in my opinion.
B000294SFW|5.0|This album is described by many as beeing trashy fast hard rock album.<br />I really don´t like trash metal rock. &quot;We are motörhead&quot; was in my opinion the worst Motörhead album <BR>and the song &quot;ace of spades&quot; isn`t one of my favorites either.<br />I myself like the more melodious and even slow Motörhead songs like  &quot;1916&quot;, &quot;love me forever&quot;, &quot;lost in the ozone&quot; and &quot;dead and gone&quot;. <BR>Don`t get me wrong i still like some kick ass songs too but the more melodious songs are my favorites.<br />This beeing said, although almost every song is a fast one(except for &quot;whorehouse blues&quot; which is excelent!), <BR>I still enjoyted every song on &quot;Inferno&quot;. They all had somekind of a hook in them which i like. <BR>I think &quot;Inferno&quot; is one of Motörheads best albums. <br />I recommend this album to every motörhead fan!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This is a slick film.  From the filming locations to the wardrobe worn by the actors, this film is definitely about style.  The plot centers around a beautiful female vampire named Selene.  Selene has spent the past few centuries hunting down and killing Werewolves.  She lives for the kill and hates them with a passion.  But fate is not always kind, and sometimes takes us on a very difficult path.  As luck would have it, Selene falls in love with a handsome Werewolf.<br />This is not your typical, gothic Vampire flick.  The Vampires and Werewolves in Underworld make good use of human technology to help them in their quest to annihilate one another.  This movie is similar to your common action film in that it is full of high tech firearms, computers, hip clothes, and fancy cars.  But it differs in that this one actually has an interesting plot.  Kate Beckinsale is very sexy as Selene.  She looks terrific in her black leather outfit.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000148KK2|2.0|&quot;The Girl in the Other Room, is  something else: her and new husband Elvis Costello's attempts to make music perfect for entertaining in their huge New York apartment.  As such, it's kind of a snooze. Half of Room's 12 tunes are Krall-Costello co-writes, including one called &quot;Abandoned Masquerade&quot; that I won't quote out of respect for, well, &quot;lyrics as a concept&quot;.
0446677450|2.0|Easy read-18 minutes &amp; spelling and grammer errors are throughout. Plus, pure money making &quot;Dribble&quot;. Follow this &amp; you LOOSE!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park Meteora is the best cd Linkin Park has done almost every home has this cd you cant be without it you listen to it once and you already know all the songs the best part is it has all the best songs on it, like Numb, Somwhere I belong (my personal favorite), Breaking the Habit, Easier to run and sooo many more. Even the people who dont like Metal or alternative music have this cd and thats pretty weird. You have to buy this cd its the bset.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Her music is so unique mixing punk, rock, pop, and country into a great Album. Every song is well written and sung with perfection. There are atleast 4 songs that you can hum to all day, after day. Personal Favorite is &quot;Who Knows&quot;, its so catchy it should have been her debute single.
B000002UAR|5.0|Oh,its true,thousands of music luminaries voted revolver the greatest album of all time,while it came in at number 3 of all time on the rolling stone poll. The results are cast in stone,Revolver is one of the all time greats,and all polls say that thats the truth!!!
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I won't try to add anything to the reviewers that have given this two CD set an excellent rating. I have been listening to progressive rock for many years, and this is one of the very best I have heard. If you enjoy anything Neal has ever done, buy this CD. Unless you are one of those people who hate any mention of God or Christ, you will not be sorry.
006054094X|5.0|If you read this lively and entertaining book, you'll hope Gavin Menzies is right and will offer further evidence of his notions.  This book is certainly a bit fanciful, but just too fun to ignore.<br />The idea that Europeans were nothing more than &quot;also rans&quot; shakes the bedrock of our historical foundation, but the snippets of miscellaneous 'discoveries' (such as the strange descriptions of kangaroos, the flora and fauna transplants, and the suspicious wreckages located off far-flung coasts) tempt me towards investigating the 'new' frontiers of speculation. <br />I don't doubt Menzies' sailing expertise, but he needs a battery of other experts to back up some of his tangential theories.  I certainly hope he finds them.  I look forward to reading the further research that is sure to follow.  It would certainly be fun to imagine that the Chinese managed to get an ancient ship lodged in San Francisco, located the North Pole, mined in Australia, and swapped goods with the early Central Americans.<br />With style and enthusiasm, Gavin Menzies opened up a big 'can-o-worms' that will provide several decades of exciting study and further speculation.  This book is a great place to begin that intellectual journey that awaits.<br />(paperback version)
B0000C2IQD|5.0|Theyve finally rleased this film in widescreen as they should have done years ago. And for the record this is NOT a DISNEY movie! It was made and released by UNITED ARTISTS. Don't you guys read the credits?
6305078181|4.0|Ignore all the folks vetching and GET the DVD if you can find it...<br />I've seen every version of this thing from it's incarnation as a Bway play, it's airing as a film in the theatre, on cable, the VHS, and DVD, and there is NO difference in color or quality from the way it was done on screen. Yes, there was some BRIGHT color on screen but it was NOT throughout the whole film.  <br />The b&amp;w thing was done INTENTIONALLY and it was that way in the original cut. The revamped Hamilton-Deane stage play upon which the film is based had Edward Gorey type sets in B&amp;W with touches of brilliant red. The film follows this in a smaller way with a more downplayed coloring scheme. The reason you see the brighter colors only part of the time is because it was the director's way of getting the same effect as the stage sets. Misty B&amp;W period look for most part, then a sudden change to bright color... <br />IMHO, it WORKS. It's eerie, and it's effective...<br />As for Langella, I think perhaps of all his fine performances this is the one for which he will be most remembered and justifiably so. His was a unique Dracula, a passionate Dracula, and yes, IMHO,one of the BEST Dracula's I've ever seen, and I've seen them ALL. I like a lot of them, Lugosi, Lee, Jourdan, and Oldman in particular. <br />For Pre-CGI the effects are excellent and for once they do harken back to the folklore which inspires the vampire legend besides. The horse in the graveyard for instance is straight out of Rumanian myth...<br />(Mina's being a moldering corpse is intentional I think too. The director is making a distinction between &quot;prey&quot; and &quot;love interest&quot; here. Mina is basically FOOD, whereas Lucy, Dracula wants to make his bride. The inference here is that there is a difference and the blood exchanged between Lucy and Dracula makes her more like him. Mina, poor thing is simply destined to rot until someone stakes her....She's the &quot;tradtional&quot; vampire of folklore, and I was truly creeped out by her makeup job actually...It was unusually horrific for the time period in which this film was made...)<br />There are some nice touches in this film, and I honestly feel it holds up well some 25 years later. It's still a favorite, and justifiably so...In terms of acting it far surpasses the FFC 92&quot; Dracula, and though it's not as showy it's still every bit as enjoyable to watch now as it was when I first saw it in the theatre. <br />It's a bit grainy in DVD, and I'd surely like to see a better transfer and maybe a cleaned up and completely restored soundtrack, but otherwise? I wouldn't change a thing, and I certainly would NOT want it colorized to make it all perfectly even. <br />It just wouldn't be the same &quot;Dracula&quot; at all...<br />Morrighan
B00005JKCH|4.0|This was a good movie with lots of great special effects and action sequences.  If you like superhero-type movies you'll really enjoy this family oriented movie. I would recommend this movie.
068483605X|5.0|I can't remember why I ordered \\"Watership Down\\" out of the Scholastic book order catalog when I was in 7th grade back in 1974, but I am forever glad that I did. I'm sure I found the description interesting, and I am sure I was drawn by what sounded to be a more substantial story. Boy was I right.<br />I was utterly gripped by Watership Down, and over the years have read and re-read the book - sometimes re-reading just the El-ahrairah portions. <br />Just great.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This movie was awesome. I could watch it 100 more times and still find it fun and enjoyable.  I would highly recommend this movie for everyone's collection.  You will not be disappointment.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ok, im a big fan of Slipknot. I've listen to all their cd's, and dvd's/movies. I have noticed a big change in them from their last cd's and I think its a good change. On their last cd's, there had been a few songs that i didnt like that much, but on this cd, i like every song.<BR>-Prelude....8/10, I think this song is a really good song to start the cd. <br />-Blister Exists....10/10, one of the best songs on the cd. It just has the old &quot;hate' type of slipknot music. <br />-Three Nil....9/10, I like this song, it has a really cool sounding corus, but it isnt one of their best songs.<br />-Duality....10/10, I dont think this should have been on of the singles for the cd, just because i dont think its their best one. Although it is a really good song with good beats and lyrics.<br />-Opium of the People....7/10, i must say that this is my least favorite song on here, just because of the guitars.<br />-Circle.....9/10, for an accoustic song from slipknot!!!!What the hell were they thinking. Well, im glad they did because this song is really good. its like a little break in the heavy songs right in the middle of the cd. But this song is really good.<br />-Welcome....8/10, pretty good song. thats all i have to say.<br />-Vermilion....9/10, This song is another one of my favorites. I think it sounds the best towards the end. But it is a good song.<br />-Pulse of the Maggots...9/10, another single...i liked this one more than duality though. The build up part in the beginning is a really good part. But the only flaw in it is the solo's towards the end. Mick and Jim could have done alot better.<br />-Before I Forget...10/10, This song is soo good.(and yes i meant to put 2 o's). It has everything needed to make a good song.<br />-Vermilion, Pt. 2...8/10, Pretty much just like the pt.1 but a little slower and different lyrics. I dont like this one as much as the other one but i still like it alot.<br />- Nameless....10/10, this is my favorite song out of all on this cd.Its a heavy song that switches singer after every verse, and also has a slow chorus. I dont know, i just listen to it alot...it gets stuck in my head..therefor its my favorite.<br />-Virus of Life..8/10, kinda creepy song. Its a good song to put towards the end.<br />-Danger - Keep Away...8/10, ok...last song. The thing about this song is weird. It has the most simple beat you could ever think of...but it WILL get stuck in your head. Other then that, there isnt really much special about this song.
B000063DIH|4.0|Many are complaining that this doesn't sound like a Maiden album and a lot of the songs are out of character for them. That's true but that doesn't mean the material is weak - just different. If you like Bruce's solo stuff then you'll love this album because that's mostly what you get. To me, the last four songs are the best, maybe just because the two songs before those are pretty bad... but it really kicks into high gear with The Apparition, Judas Be My Guide, Weekend Warrior, and Fear of the Dark. A fantastic finish to an album that seriously drags in the middle portion. Out of the twelve songs, four should have been left out, which would give you the Maiden you're used to - an album with eight classic tracks.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I'm surprised some of the bad reviews that I have been reading about this CD.  This is one of the best by Zakk and the band.  It's good to know that a band like this can make a little different music without selling out.<br />I haven't gotten into too many newer bands lately but I am huge fan of B.L.S.
B000002IST|5.0|I was recently doing some cleaning up and moving around when I 'redicovered' this album on tape version. I'd forgotten all about Genesis' &quot;We Can't Dance&quot; and after one listen in the tape player, it reminded me how much I love this. Throughout their many years, this band has created some classic hits. This album can be played and loved at anytime throughout the year because every track can have an appeal for every momment. &quot;No Son Of Mine&quot; is my jam.<br />&quot;You're no son, no son of mine,<BR>You're no son, no son of mine,<BR>You walked out, you left us behind,<BR>And you're no son, no son of mine&quot;<br />That ones just my jam right there. &quot;I Can't Dance&quot; was another classic groove from this album.<br />&quot;Cos, I can't dance, I can't talk,<BR>The only thing about me is the way I walk,<BR>No I can't dance, I can't sing,<BR>I'm just standing here selling&quot;<br />Every joint on here is a classic in my opinion. &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot;, &quot;Never A Time&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;I Can't Dance&quot;, &quot;No Son Of Mine&quot;. All classic grooves. As much as I would love the CD version of this, the tape version seems to make it more special - as if it's more of a discovery. Though I think the reason I feel like this is that it's special by anymeans. A real collection of tight jams. I can recommend this to all fans of music, and if you're like me, you'll fall in love with it on first listen. 5 stars.
0425107469|4.0|it watt really good<br />I really liked it was really good book that I would love to see it againa aol the time sdfsdfd sfsd the fact that i am a girl makes it feel really good and cool and and i loved that book <br />so so much  and very much I loved it so much too and just like my friends.
0684800713|5.0|I loved this book, and thought it a little bit strange.  The characters are so completely detached from their lives, and the bullfight and fiesta serve as an antithesis to their monotonous fleeting lifestyles.  Some of the characters were so downright strange, and almost fake, that it left me with a kind of empty helpless feeling.<br />  First of all, the female character, Brett, is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read about. Her mannerisms, and life choices are so interesting. She seems very beautiful, and I can see why everyone is is love with her. The male characters are also interesting, the main character being almost emotionless and accepting of his life, although he is in love with Brett, he is happy to just be her friend. You get the feeling that being hurt in the war has really changed him, and made him apathetic, and happy to live vicariously through the bullfight. The character of Cohn is also really interesting, and dark, although the descriptions of him seem a little anti-semitic in this day and age.<br />  The descriptions of the bullfights, and the fiesta in Spain, are truly magnificent, and make me want to go to Spain and see the bullfights, even though I am a longtime vegetarian and animal lover! The descriptions were just that powerful. The character of the bullfighter is also a classic literary character, strong and attractive.<br />  The prose of Hemingway is different than anything I have ever read, and I like it.  He doesn't say much, yet he says a lot. By sticking to the simplicity of a situation, he manages to expose the depth that lies beneath. All in all, I loved this book, and I think it is relavent today, and can be related to anyone who lives their life fleetingly from pleasure to pleasure. A lot of drinking in this book!
0385335482|1.0|I've nothing against a light summer read...and that is what I'd hoped for when I picked up this book.  Unfortunately the 'heroine' is repugnant to the point where I was actually unhappy that things worked out for her in the end.  She showed no true remorse for her lies, schemes and immaturity; so I wasn't routing for her to overcome them.  Also, the 'turnaround' in her career was at best happenstance...and so preposterous and unbelievable.   So, I think I can sum up my review in a single word which reflects the amount of thought and creativity that went into writing this fiction:  BOO.
B000002H1T|5.0|In the early 1980s, the Cars were beginning to gain significant popularity.   Their syntho-pop/new-wave sound and looks fit perfect with the trend of the early 1980s.  By the time the Cars would release &quot;Hearbeat City&quot; in 1984, the timing couldn't have been better for a monster hit album.   The syntho-pop/new-wave sound of the 80s was reaching its peak.   The Cars had been knocking on the door for several years with albums such as &quot;Candy-o&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot;, and &quot;Shake it Up&quot;.  1984's &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; would not only bring commercial success to the group, but the group would really show their strongest work to date.<br />Up until 1981, the Cars would be produced by Roy Thomas Baker.  Following 1981's &quot;Shake It Up&quot;, the band went on a 3 year hiatus and would bring in a new producer - Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange (better known as Mr. Shania Twain).    Baker had done a solid job with the Cars, but it would be Lange who would really show his strength that would put the Cars over the top.   The Cars would now cross-over as full-fledged Superstars and in addition continue to maintain strong to their New Wave roots.  Lange had been more known as Def Leppard's &quot;Pyromania&quot; producer and would prove he would have a lot of diversity as well (he would go on to produce artists such as Bryan Adams, Shania Twain, and Billy Ocean).<br />Despite Lange's presence, the Cars themselves deserve an enormous amount of credit.   Top to bottom, this is one heck of an album.  Lead singer and guitarist Ric Ocasek writes all ten songs (9 of the 10 are written by himself with the other co-written by Keyboardist Greg Hawkes).   Ric Ocasek does the lion's share of the lead vocals, but bassist Benjamin Orr gets the opportunity to do lead vocals on three of the most interesting tracks on the collection.   It's Orr's vocals on what is perhaps the album and group's signature song &quot;Drive&quot;.  This is the song that really showed the crossover as it hit big on the pop and adult contemporary charts.  In this song, The Cars take their syntho-pop sound and basically take it down to a ballad level.  While Orr's stirring vocals really make the song, Ocasek writes a masterpiece about someone fighting for a chance to keep a relationship going.   The Cars have their more traditional sound on &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot;.  This song has more of a tech-rock sound.   This was a song largely ignored by the radio, but still is a solid song.  Orr takes lead vocals on this song, but sometimes it almost seems as if his voice is &quot;fused&quot; with Ocasek's even though Orr has a solo lead on this.   Greg Hawkes on keyboards and David Robinson on drums are really going to play a key role on this song.  The third Orr led &quot;It's Not the Night&quot; song has more of a haunting feel (it could have easily have been a Halloween song). Orr provides some great haunting lead vocals.   Excellent background vocals and excellent guitar work by Ocasek and Elliot Easton on this track.<br />The Cars gained a lot of popularity through the very pop like hits &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;You Might Think&quot; in which Ric Ocasek does lead vocals.   These songs fit very well on the radio and are good songs, but Ocasek lends vocals to much stronger tracks.  The first two tracks &quot;Hello Again&quot; and &quot;Looking for Love&quot; are prime examples of this.   &quot;Hello Again&quot; is another techo-rock song.  This did get radio airplay, but by the time it did - the album had already peaked.   The keyboards take a strong lead on the intro to the song.  There is some great keyboards on this song by Hawkes - especially during the chorus.   The techo feel of the song really takes center stage after &quot;you leave it all, to fade to blue&quot; - a computer like sound is played, with some nice guitar work.  The background vocals of &quot;Hello&quot; also compliment Ocasek's lead perfectly.  The second track, &quot;Lookingfor Love&quot;, should have got some more airplay - but didn't.  This song has a great intro with some nice bass work by Orr, and Ocasek's spoken vocals of &quot;Come on Lover, make the switch&quot;.     Finally, the title cut of the album &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; deserves a lot of credit.  Along with &quot;Drive&quot;, this is another masterpiece on the album.  It has a techno rock theme to it with a futurist &quot;car and garage&quot; sound at the beginning.  The song overall seems to show how the Cars have taken their syntho pop roots and showed how they can stay true to them while maturing as a group.  Sometimes this song is referred to as just &quot;Jacki&quot;.   Ocasek also provides some stirring vocals and Hawkes again comes alive on keyboards.   The only weak song on this album is the song &quot;Why Can't I Have You&quot;.  I'm surprised that this was released as a single when there was so much more this colleciton offered.<br />A word on the music videos.  This album produced some of the most imaginative and creative music videos of all time - including the award winning &quot;You Might Think&quot; that really made the Cars a pioneer in using technology in their videos. &quot;Drive&quot; is another classic with Paulina Porizkova (Ric's wife) playing the role of a woman going insane.  There were other videos, but it is important to note that this album stands on its own and if there were no videos, this album should still be considered a classic.<BR>Liner notes are outstanding with all lyrics included on this album as well as songwriting and instrument credits of the band. <br />Following &quot;Heartbeat City&quot;, as the music landscape in the 80s changed to a more hard rock sound, the Cars would have trouble gaining commercial success on the follow-up album &quot;Door to Door&quot;.  This album however stands the test of time.
B000002OCP|1.0|The reviewers below must be joking. This is an abomination - probably the worst album I've ever heard.  I'm not a purist, just a lover of good music - and even Muddy recognised that this was awful.  Much maligned?  It really can't be maligned enough.  By any standard this is truly dreadul - an attempt by an ill-informed record label to make Muddy Waters more accessible to white audiences.  How?  Who knows.  Do yourself a favour, if you're after &quot;Electric Mud&quot;, go for either &quot;Hard Again&quot; or &quot;I'm Ready&quot; (both produced by Johnny Winters).  Poisoned chalk and an epicurist's cheese!
B00000I07P|5.0|I guess in 1986 the time was right for Bon Jovi. After two albums that got a little attention Bon Jovi released their third album &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; thus began Bon Jovi mania!MTV helped break the band into the big leagues of rock and roll.With their polished pop/metal sound Bon Jovi was able to size a handful of singles out of the album and have a huge #1 record. While their success may have came as a surprise to some people, it wasn't a surprise to those who had their first two albums, which are almost as good. Livin' on a prayer, You Give Love a Bad Name, and Wanted Dead or Alive were all huge hits, but the remainder of the album was also filled with songs equally as entertaining like Never Say Goodbye and I'd die for you.
B000000WJK|5.0|The Verve were a British band that were at the outset lumped into the shoegaze circle. They had all of the trappings of shoegazers like My Bloody Valentine--a strong reliance on guitar effects and other electronic devices that could alter the sound of the traditional rock instruments. The Verve, however, had something which made them superior. They had a wider range of influences. These influences (especially Krautrock) made them look to the stars rather than to their shoes and set them apart from the alternative music of their time.<br /><br />Like the Hendrix Experience or Floyd, the Verve had a master guitarist as their epicenter--Nick McCabe. Rather than merely burying his guitar under studio generated noise as did Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine or countless other shoegazers, McCabe spent less time in simply hiding the guitar under layers of sounds and more time doing what was the hallmark of all great psychedelic music--bending the notes in new ways. David Gilmour is still renowned not because of his effects arsenal or technical proficiency but simply because of the slow, ponderous emotion that he could wring out of a few simple notes. Like Gilmour, McCabe did not focus on the riff or on noise, but on what can only be termed \\"washes\\" of sound that paint the backdrop of the songs while the rhythm section (the bass/drums) do what they do best--keep rhythm.<br /><br />Another thing which set the Verve's debut LP A Storm in Heaven apart from their peers was, of course, their total defiance of genre. The Verve painted their songs not only with misty and intoxicating guitar washes but also with a breathtaking and inspiring array of various instruments, such as saxophones, trumpets, and flutes, which attested to their experimentation not only with jazz fusion but with atmosphere, in general.<br /><br />A Storm in Heaven has a Zen/Taoist-tinged sense of beauty illustrated by the cavernous guitar of Nick McCabe, as well as the album art: a front cover with a womb like cave and a figure of rebirth and a back cover with an old man giving a peace sign in a cemetery.<br /><br />The first track on A Storm in Heaven, \\"Star Sail\\", establishes a pattern which recurs throughout the album--what can only be described in the analogies of darkness and illumination, silences and awakenings, oceanic rising and falling, journeys through inner and outer space.<br /><br />With this first awe-inspiring track, the Verve create a foundation for the entire album which can be discerned in the paradoxical quality of the album's title: a blurring of the lines between chaos and cosmos, between yin and yang, between a rock-solid rhythm section and an oceanic guitar of drifts and squalls. And lost in the center of this vortex is Richard Ashcroft.<br /><br />A burst of distortion tapers off into sonorous distance. The guitar then begins a melody with ringing notes that becomes doubled after echo and delay. The bass and drums are thrumming a steady beat like the buildup to a rocket launch. The rhythm opens into a wider vista and a wordless mantric \\"ahhhh\\" wells up out of this brief interval, tunneling skyward. Another rhythm is opened up--no, exploded--by the reemergence of the reverb soaked guitar, illuminating the darkness of space as the rocket ship hurtles into the void.<br /><br />\\"Hello, it's me, it's me, calling out, I can't see you/Hello, it's me, crying out, crying out, are you there?\\" asks lead singer Ashcroft pleadingly, wandering adrift in this starry limbo.<br /><br />\\"I've been calling home for 20 years and in that time I heard the screams rebound to me while you were making history,\\" Ashcroft later declares. Then he yells in his mystical madness, \\"I could see the fires!\\" McCabe's guitar captures that image in bold, surging space-rock glory, showering meteoric sparks in spiraling arcs. The song reclaims its original chiming melody and then fades into silence.<br /><br />It is only on songs like \\"Slide Away\\" and \\"Blue\\" that the rhythm section is a stronger force, pulling the melodies back to earth as they dare like Icarus to kiss the sky. \\"Slide Away\\" opens on Simon Jones' sculpted, icy bass groove that remains the song's focal point as Nick McCabe once again takes off on airy, cloud borne expeditions which mirror Ashcroft's eye-opening epiphanies of beauty: \\"I was thinking maybe we could go outside/Let the night sky cool your foolish pride/Don't you feel alive?/These are your times and our highs\\".<br /><br />It is drummer Pete Salisbury who is the driving force of \\"Blue\\" as his cymbals are fed through a backwards tape loop which, in all of its<br />psyched-out fuzz, keeps a relentless beat that firmly grounds the song in Ashcroft's grimy city streets and references to Ecstasy, a murder and the wildest party you never remembered: \\"Conceived in a chrome dream/I was a crease in the shirt that this world wears\\" Ashcroft confesses in his rock'n'roll rebel swagger and splendor. \\"Blue, I've got a question every time I hold you/Yeah, Blue, I've got a question every time I swallow you it's true\\".<br /><br />The album is also constructed like the best of classic vinyl. The first side of the album (the first five tracks) is a journey through outer space (tracks 1 and 2) and inner space (tracks 3 and 4)--it is the \\"Heaven\\" of the album's title. Tracks 3 and 4, in particular, convey the most blissed out depths of the album's sound.<br /><br />\\"Already There\\" is the album's hidden highlight. This track best encapsulates the incredible and mesmerizing pattern of alternating spaces of silence with awakenings of consciousness. The song glides in and unfurls out of quiet darkness as McCabe's guitar sends out equal parts shadowy and shimmering echoes that resemble a harp submerged underground or underwater. The subtle tapping of Pete Salisbury on drums slowly leads the traveling passenger on the Stygian bark into the light.<br /><br />\\"Seen it all I'm already there\\" Ashcroft intones in a mysterious and ghostly voice. \\"Save your books and your pills/I don't need them I'm there,\\" Ashcroft repeats as the tone of McCabe's scintillating guitar slowly hums in expanding glows.<br /><br />\\"I thought the best days had left me/My best years had left me behind,\\" Ashcroft ruminates in wistfulness and nostalgia. \\"Then I watched them come back,\\" he reveals and the fragile monochrome filigrees are shattered into jagged jewelled fragments.<br /><br />Then Ashcroft truly gets into the mystic: \\"If trees cut stars and eyes to heaven/I'll bend them back and bend them again/If my skin looks tired and old from living/I'll turn right back and live it again/You better pray when the music stops/And you're left alone in your mind/I'll be hearing music 'till the day I die\\". The guitar shifts into a higher plane as the intrepid traveler ascends for a moment into the shining presence.<br /><br />\\"Then I heard it turn off,\\" Ashcroft blazes amidst the trance. The guitar drops into earthbound power chords which drown Ashcroft's voice as he struggles to emerge from his memories of ancestors and the spirit world: \\"I swear I heard the screams/And all the wild eyes/All the wild eyes know what I mean/They're scared they've lost their dream/They press down on me\\".<br /><br />\\"You know I thought I was there,\\" he admits in clarity as darkness falls once more. \\"Hello, high, are you?/Yes, well that explains it/Oh you were walking round like some kind of angel/You were walking round like some kind of angel/Hello, high, are you?/Yes, well that explains it/That explains it\\".<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Mind\\" finds the listener in the cave which adorns the album's cover. Everything is more subdued now as shivering reverberations resound through the peaceful stillness. Ashcroft muses once more upon moving back home and about continuing his quest for mind and spirit in the heavens or simply returning to earth and to the body. The song drifts towards waking life but remains in the womb of sleep.<br /><br />\\"The Sun, The Sea\\" is the most powerful track on the entire album and it closes the first side of the album with a definite answer to the mind/body question. The body and earth have reclaimed their son. \\"It amazes me how I broke free/And got brought back in\\".<br /><br />In the midst of a song of secret love and desire, Ashcroft becomes a seer who through a systematic derangement of the senses finds the meaning of life in his lover who has nicknamed him after their unity (and ostensibly a Rimbaud poem).<br /><br />Tidal waves of feedback and frenzied, turbulent riffs crash down in tempests amidst a fiery sun that burns so brightly that the lead singer goes blind as he searches for a woman's outstretched naked body on his bedroom floor. Then comes a climactic orgasm, a paroxysm of fury and euphoria as Ashcroft holds to the mast of his capsized raft upon the ocean and chants: \\"Hold on now/Hold on now/Here it comes/Here it comes...\\" and trails off as the guitar has become not a wall of sound but a hurricane of sound that descends upon him into the abyss. The swell from the speakers is accompanied by raving saxophones that wail out a swooping and diving free jazz air raid that perfectly complements the multi-layered typhoon guitars.<br /><br />\\"Virtual World\\" is, of course, the return to earth and to the \\"real\\" world on the second side of the album. Ashcroft (and the band) have, indeed, returned home and it is twilight, that ambiguous time between night and dawn, as fog shrouds the landscape. \\"See the water break my hand/No one knows my name/I'm not in demand\\", Ashcroft begins in a near whisper that has touches of melancholy and resignation. Ashcroft reflects upon not only his return home and his return to earth, but also broods over the machinations of relationships and of the record/music industry, and finally society, in general. His contemplations are not vitriolic nor satirical, they are merely meditations in the \\"dirty half-light where time means nothing at all\\". Flutes enter the crystalline dreamscape, fluttering and trembling like a winter morning breeze beckoning at the curtains of a half-open window (or a half-open mind) as the grayness of daybreak enters.<br /><br />\\"Make It Till Monday\\" follows perfectly and is the shortest song on the entire album, acting more as an atmospheric interlude as the wanderer (as well as the listener) rubs the sleep from his eyes and wipes the steam from his home and car window to travel back into the world of his home town. Except things have changed.<br /><br />\\"Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday?/Another Friday night waiting for a revelation/I can see a million faces in the condensation\\"<br />The trippy moods of sensual and passionate catharsis which would have accompanied these lyrics on the first side of the album have now been restrained by a cerebral detachment that is both hypnotic and melancholy.<br /><br />\\"Butterfly\\" is the storm in heaven. It can only be described in elemental or meteorological terms: gusts of wind and rain, flashes of thunder and lightning, rolling vapors. Guitars are layered atop one another and build and build until the clouds burst. The wanderer (and the listener) are caught out in the weather as maddening saxophones and trumpets freeze the downpour into hail, ice, and snow which plummet in a blizzard upon the lost soul as he struggles to find his way back home.<br /><br />Finally \\"See You in the Next One (Have a Good Time)\\" is the calm after the storm, the shelter from the storm. It is bittersweet and intimate as a reverbed acoustic guitar and piano leave glistening tears like rain on the windowpane. They also bring a sigh to the listener as the end of the journey has been reached. There is a sense of closure as Ashcroft plaintively and earnestly sings from his melancholy and childlike view: \\"Eyes they open wide/I like the way it was/Hate the way it is now\\". When the storm has passed, heaven can be seen again (in a new relationship or love, in the next phase of one's life,or in the next life itself).have reclaimed their son. \\"It amazes me how I broke free/And got brought back in\\".

B00008BXJJ|2.0|In 92 Ac/dC live came out in both single and double editions. Neither one is really that great! Ac/Dc is one of hard rock/metal's best groups,but just like everyone else, not everything that they do is good. One of the biggest flaws of the album is that it is too self indulgent. Most people don't want to hear songs in excess of ten minute running times. Another flaw is that the Bon Scott era is not represented very well, I know he's dead, but most of Ac/Dc's better albums were from the Bon Scott era. Highway to hell is only represented by the title track, big mistake there Highway to Hell is just as good as Back in Black if not better! Also not enough from High Voltage. The sound quality isn't that bad, but the song selections could have been better, so I must only recommend this album for die hard Ac/Dc fans, the ones why buy everything they release whether good or bad!
B00005JMYG|5.0|Anchorman is an extremly funny movie! Ron Burgundy (ferrell)is a male anchorman in the 1970s, where nobody had ever heard of a female anchor.  But almost suddenly, his anchoring job is taken away by Veronica Corningstone (applegate)!  The movie does have a happy ending, and many belly laughs!  It was one of the funniest movies this year!!  Ferrell's one-liners will keep you laughing!  This is Ron Burgundy saying, stay classy!
B000002UBB|4.0|Fly like an Eagle is one of the Steve Miller Band's greatest albums. Over half the songs on the album became hits singles. Fly Like an Eagle,Take the Money and Run, Rockn Me,etc are all popular staples on classic rock radio, and when an album has this many great singles it's worth owning. So forget greatest hits 1974-1978 and pick up Fly like an Eagle instead!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie show that Jesus died for my & your sins. In the Bible Show who is Jesus is. We are sinners. You see the movie, you will cry why they see what they did to Jesus.
B000000OQF|5.0|In the time of hair metal, Guns N Roses came crashing onto the scene with their hard rocking, gritty debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; bringing great Rock n Roll back to life in an era of techno crap and a lot of faceless pop/hair metal bands. Appetite starts with the feriocious opener Welcome to the Jungle, and runs through twelve classic tracks. Every song on this album is a winner, and at lease half of them are classic rock radio staples to this day;Sweet Child O'MIne, Paradise City, Mr.Brownstone,etc all sound great pumping out of the stereo.Instead of going to the music store for the newest radio hits, pick up &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; instead,you won't regret it.

B00002Z88D|4.0|Metallica's S&amp;M is a live concert with an orchestra. While the idea may scare fans off, the orchestra accompanying Metallica's songs is quite good. The playing from both groups is good, and what makes it even better is that being a live album, it removes the filler that often makes their albums dull and boring.
B000002JQ6|4.0|If you want a sampling of AC/DC live this is a great album.  I would, however, recommend the 23 track 2 disc version that is also available.  <br />This live album has a great selection of tracks (Back in Black, You SHook Me All Night Long, Highway to Hell, Dirty Deeds, For Those Aobut to Rock, among them) but the 2 disc version is more complete.<br />Including all of the songs on this version and also Sin City, Fire Your Guns, Jailbreak, Razor's Edge, Are you Ready, High Voltage, Let There be Rock, and Bonny.<br />For Jailbreak, High Voltage, and Let There be Rock alone the 2 disc set is the better buy.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has done it again!  After three bestselling albums, Spears has another bestselling album out!  At first, when I listened to the album, I was a little leery about it.  After all, Spears is a role model for younger childeren whether she likes it or not, whether she wants it or not and a few of these songs - \\"Showdown\\",  \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\" and a few others - are sexy, perhaps bordering on too sexy.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is a great album.  It really is.  I just don't think, in my opinion, that it's for her previously targeted fan group.  It has some great dance tunes - \\"Me Against the Music\\", \\"(I've Got That) Boom Boom\\", \\"Toxic\\", etc.  With songs like these, you can't help but dance to the music.  <br />This is an album not to be missed even if it's a little wild.  With this album, Spears has definitely proved that she is \\"not that innocent\\".
B00005QENZ|4.0|When Aerosmith released Permanent Vacation it was hailed as their comeback album, and it may well have been.  Their follow up, Pump was also a fine effort.<br />By the time Get A Grip was released the reformed original line up was firing on all cylinders.  This album had several hits (unfortunately many of them also sound alike) but the real gems are the songs like Eat the Rich that didn't get airplay.<br />With Get A Grip Aerosmith successfully fused their dirty rock and blues sound with a pop-metal vibe that was virtually perfect.<br />While not as great as the classics like Toys in the Attic, Get A Grip is a worthy addition to your collection.
B00006G8LB|5.0|This movie has exceeded my expectataions of it far beyond my belief.  Probably because I went in thinking that it would suck.  I'm just not into this kind of stuff.  Of course, I'm a closet &quot;Batman&quot; fan so I guess it does say something.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie.  The cinematography was awesome!  From all the camera dynamics following Spidey's twists and flips, you really felt that you were flying through the air with him.  The cinematography also had a warm, upbeat feeling to it.  It was one of the main reasons the movie kept my eyes glued to the screen.<br />The second reason is, of course, the actors.  From Tobey Maguire's clumsy but lovable Peter Parker to Kirstin Dunst's beautiful Mary Jane Watson to Willem Dafoe's deliciously evil Green Goblin, the actors most definitely made the movie.  The producers certainly picked the right people to handle the characters.<br />The only downside to this movie was that the opening credits were too long and too boring.
B000002LUB|5.0|Two words describe this ablum HEAVY and METAL.From the first punch of vinnie appice's thundering drums in the opening track Computer God,you know your in for a heavy ole ride.And the album just keeps crushing all the way through until you get to the end and can barely stand up or breath.Dio's voice is agressive as ever,tony's riffs are actually Technical as opposed to the basic (but killer)riffs he's known for.The produciton is HUGE,and the songs still evil as hell,what more could you want from sabbath other than Ozzy.Speaking of,i love the man(the only real sabbath) but dunno if his voice would have fit with this album.So when your mad,don't hit,don't yell,don't go kill your parents just pop in this album for a crushing good heavy metal time.Highlights---Computer God,I,Buried Alive,Master of Insanity(all).
B00005RIKI|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is not just the best southern rock band ever but they are also one of the best rock bands of all time including every band out there. This CD was a great debut for this band and showed what they were made of. Take out &quot;Freebird&quot; and this album still rocks. My personal favorite song on this album and favorite Lynyrd Skynyrd song AND favorite song of all time is &quot;Simple Man&quot;. The song is amazing in every way possible. I havn't heard a song with so many good quotes in it. This song keeps me goin everyday because the meaning of the song isn't deep or complicated like many songs are, the meaning of this song is so simple and easy to understand and thats what makes it so good. Also this CD has the very popular and fun &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot; and the good &quot;Tuesdays Gone&quot;. I recommend getting this classic album because it started this band up is a great album and good album to have in your collection of classic rock albums.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar is a stark narrative about depression, and the power it has to completely immobilize protagonist Esther Greenwood and throw her into insanity. The Bell Jar's prose is easy to read, and yet Sylvia Plath's writing style is highly sophisticated and exact, which is startling considering the nearness of her own suicide. Esther Greenwood begins an ambitious and talented young writer, working for a beauty magazine in New York, and attending college on a full scholarship. Her sorrow and madness begin to surface, and she soon finds herself trapped in a revolving door of mental asylums. The interesting thing here is way the story is told; unflinchingly and without remorse. I could hear Plath's cold, spare, incisive voice behind that of Miss Greenwood - hurting and ready to die. The Bell Jar can be read as a fierce indictment on depression. It is a brilliant, haunting, frightening work, and it held my interest intensely the whole way through.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Finally, all four of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies are available in one boxed set. One of the greatest series ever to grace the screen, the movies have Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as cops on the edge bttling internation criminals while trying to keep their lives in order.<br />1987's &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; is where it all began. Roger Murtaugh (Glover) is a veteran cop who is also a consumate family man. He is very careful and doesn't take any risks. Martin Riggs (Gibson), on the other hand, is a lonely, suicidal police officer who takes risks that even Dirty Harry wouldn't do. How could these do ever work together? Well, when a young girl mysterious jumps to her death out of a highrise apartment window, the two are assigned to work together. What ensues is a nonstop action (including a shootout at a Christmas Tree store and a a daring rescue of Murtaugh's daughter) as well as lots of funny moments. Also, the two cops, opposite as they are, strike up a friendship that would go on to make millions at the box office.<br />1989's &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; has Gibson and Glover back in their roles. The two cops are slightly different now. Murtaugh is still the family man but now is more of a risktaker. Riggs is still the more daring of the two but has calmed down... somewhat. When Murtaugh's house is invaded by German criminals, the duo cracks down on a crime ring selling drugs. To make things a little more interesting for them, they are assigned to look after Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a big moout money laundere in the Witness Protection program. Pesci turns in one of his finest comedic performances in this film. Like the first one, it's exciting and funny.<br />1993's &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; came after a 4 - year hiatus. This one is my personal favorite. Gibson and Glover are back yet again, and Joe Pesci returns to the fold as well. Murtaugh is getting ready to retire from the force in this installment, leaving Riggs a little down. Somehow, Murtaugh knowsthat his last case will be a dangerous one. A shady ex - cop is selling armor - piercing bullets to his workers and kidnaps the police chief. Once again, Murtaugh and riggs have to keep the city from mass destruction while keeping themselves alive. This film icludes several great scenes, including the opening bomb sequence, the motorcycle off the roof sequence and the coda. This film is significant because Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) joins the team. She will go on to play an important role in Riggs' life. <br />&quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; came aftr a 5 - year hiatus. Most people call it the weakest effort of the series, but I like it. In this one, Riggs is now much more somber, finding inner peace with himself thanks to Lorna (Rene Russo), who is giving birth to Riggs' first child. Murtaugh is preparing to become a grandfather. Joe Pesci's Leo Getz is now a cop. Chris Rock is also a member of the force and the godfather of Riggs' grandchild. One thing stands in the way of this happy time. A Japanese crime ring led by Jet Li is plotting something and Riggs and Murtaugh go on one last adventure before riding into the sunset - amidst a frenzy of babies.<br />Overall, great dvd set. These are among my all - time favorite films. Let's hope that the cast reassmebles for &quot;Lethal Weapon 5&quot; soon.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is a great album from one of the greatest and most influential bands of all time.  It is bursting with energy and is filled with catchy riffs and politically charged lyrics.    This album is real music.  You can tell the band had a true passion for the music they played.  It is not overproduced, but instead has energy and life that is rarely found in today's lifeless music.  This cd is one of the best cds you could ever buy.  Every song on the cd is good and you can listen through several times through without ever getting tired of it.  Buy this cd now.
B000002N3J|5.0|By 1996, much had been made about Madonna the celebrity, but little is said about Madonna the artist. While some of her songs remain some of the greatest pop records ever, many people tended to focus on her \\"SEX\\" book and her risque stage antics than her music. Many people never realized her sensitive, loving side. In 1996, she decided it was time to do it. So what better to release a collection of ballads? \\"Something To Remember\\" was the result, and it was truly memorable.<br />This cd has some of Madonna's finest ballads and biggest hits from the 1980s' and 1990s'; \\"Take A Bow\\" (her biggest hit ever with 7 weeks at number one), the chilling \\"Live To Tell\\", the captivating \\"Take A Bow\\" sequel \\"You'll See\\" and of course, the classic, timeless \\"Crazy For You\\". This song was all the rage at high school dances in 1985. Also, Madonna recorded new songs like the pretty \\"Forbidden Love\\" and the eerie cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\". The album's title track (originally from the \\"Dick Tracy\\" soundtrack) is among Madonna's best works.<br />The reason I gave this cd 4.9 stars rather than the full 5 stars is because there are several songs I would have loved to have seen on this collection. For instance, I would have loed if \\"Cherish\\" was included. This is possibly Madonna's purest love song, a celebraion of love power. And while it's a great dance song, \\"Like A Prayer\\" is in the same vein. There are plenty of other songs here I could list but it would take up to much space.<br />Overall, a worthwhile collection of Madonna love songs. Let's hope she releases a volume 2 of her ballads. These songs are among her best, and let's hope she makes more like them.

0385720920|4.0|Few books can survive on a clever idea alone.  Palahniuk is probably the only author I know who can pull this off.  This is not to say that the rest of &quot;Choke&quot; is not clever--it is--but the premise alone is good enough.  Victor Mancini is a con artists of mega proportions.  By day he works in a colonial theme park and when he's not doing that, he goes to restaurants and diners and fakes &quot;choking.&quot;  This, in order to get cash to help his mother who is a nursing home.  <br />I thought the writing in this novel was simply brilliant and can't wait to tackle all of Palahnuik's works. Bravo

B000148KK2|5.0|Don't like it?  Your loss.  Those of us in the know already realize that this recording will be a watershed in Ms. Krall's long and illustrious career.  She has the musical gifts and the artistic sensitivity to make her one of the great jazz singer/pianists of her generation.  Long live the Costello /Krall collaboration.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Whether or not Neil Young's musical tree can be traced back to rock `n roll's Mesozoic age, he certainly isn't fooling anyone on Greendale, rife as it is with self-deprecation and disguise. Here, on what is billed as his &quot;rock novel,&quot; Young stuffs the mouths of a peculiar array of characters with political indictments and platitudes attributable only to the man behind the masks.<br />I mean, it isn't as though members of the original Woodstocker wing of Young's fan base will hear him sing &quot;we've got to save mother Earth&quot; on &quot;Be The Rain,&quot; Greendale's fabulously hokey coda, and drop their jaws in astonishment, declaring &quot;Man! Now there's something I never expected out of the guy's mouth!&quot;<br />Whether it is &quot;Grandpa,&quot; the Green family's wealthy patriarch killed by media assault, or Sun Green, his granddaughter, a bandleader with a particularly overwhelming urge to protect Alaska from environmental ruin, there is rarely any question as to whom the Green family owes its gripes and eccentricities. Nor is there much surprise that Greendale's characters, each a mouthpiece for the curmudgeon who forged them, are no more distinct from one another than one shade of gray from the next.<br />&quot;There's a lot going on in Greendale that I don't know about either,&quot; Young scribbles in the liner notes, &quot;I mean, I made it up and I don't know what the hell's going on.&quot; The man's not kidding. From the FBI to Edith to Earle to Lenore to Jed's car &quot;full-uh-cocaine&quot; and, oh yeah, the cop he shoots dead, the action here boasts of about as much clarity and purpose as Mary Carey's candidacy for Governor of California. To be kind, the album's rampant chaos and paranoia does do a decent job of capturing the hysteria of post 9/11 life, but Greendale defies even the Neilophiles to derive anything coherent from the &quot;plot,&quot; if you will.<br />In contrast to past Neil Young &quot;experiments,&quot; however, this one is no more surprising than it is new. Crazy Horse and Young's rude riffs are just as snotty as ever this time around, despite Poncho Sampedro's noticeable absence. A somewhat quieter affair for the Horse, still the jangling fury and filthy harmonica of &quot;Sun Green&quot; and &quot;Devil's Sidewalk&quot; rank them among the finest dirges of Neil's career. Similarly, it isn't just the album's cartoonish cover art that smacks of Young's 1975 masterpiece, Zuma. The music, too, conjures shadows of past triumphs such as &quot;Pardon My Heart,&quot; &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; &quot;Drive Back,&quot; &quot;Danger Bird&quot; and &quot;Don't Cry No Tears Around Me.&quot;<br />The breezy blues of &quot;Double E,&quot; &quot;Leave the Driving&quot; and &quot;Charmichael&quot; contribute an unusual consistency to an album that demonstrates Young's long-standing endearment to blues great Jimmy Reed. At 57 (or thereabouts-let's play nice, kids) there's always the chance of fading away before burning out. But even if Young's rips and solos have softened with age, the bursts of flame speckling Greendale make it hard to accuse him of laurel resting.<br />The real clincher, by the way, is the bonus DVD which features Young live, solo and unplugged running through a first-song-to-last performance of the album. This bare acoustic blueprint of what ultimately became &quot;Greendale&quot; attests both to the power Young continues to command as well as what might have been had he not gone electric with this one. Don't get me wrong, &quot;Greendale&quot; still rocks, but the album's stripped-down counterpart is nothing short of sublime.this one is no more surprising than it is new.

B000089RVR|5.0|Let me just start by saying that there is some really crappy music out there. Shopping for music these days feels like you're walking in a mine field...I'm constantly faced with the question &quot;Do I really wanna shell out 18 bucks for this?&quot; usually I don't. That's how I felt when I picked up this album. In the end I'm glad I bought it. It's the best thing I've heard in a long time, sure Dido's not all that edgy, but not everybody has to be. Personally, I'm sick of listening to political music. Some musicians should stop campaigning and make music. In short, I urge people to buy this album. It does what pop music should do: take you do a better place. While she's not going tyo be nominated for the Nobel prize Dido brings peace into my life` and that's why I'm so glad she's around and so pleased th at I bought this CD, and no, I'm not some accountant in their mid 30's contrary to the Dido fan stereotype. I'm just a teenager who loves music.
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Okay first of all for the people who say that this movie is stupid, and overrated the same people probably thought Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was an excellent movie. I guess you people have to have everything spelled out and handed to you on a silver platter, if you stop and think for a minute about what you just watched it would all make perfect sense. To those who have'nt seen listen to the critics who praised this film, they were all right, you can read about the plot through all the other reviews on here so i'm not gonna write it again. This movie is not for those who wants everything explained to them, and that's the only way to understand the movie, if you can figure movies out for yourself and don't need everything spelled out for you to understand it then watch this wonderful masterpiece.<BR>Okay if you have not seen the film do not read any further, plot given away if you read any further, please don't read if you have not seen the film!!!!<BR>Okay for those who didn't understand the ending and were disappointed in it, you obviously wasn't watching the movie close enough or it would have totally made sense. So you ask how can Jimmy just get away with murder???? The answer is simple Sean is a crooked cop. which is signified at the end of the movie. Question how can him and his wife make love when he has just killed someone innocent? answer is simple: if you paid attention in the movie you would have learned that Jimmy has killed before when he is talking to Dave at mystic river he lets the audenice know this by stating &quot;How many people i killed here&quot;(mystic river) remember Ray Harris? how do you think he gets away with killing people, SEAN, BINGO! The audience (us) are led to believe that Sean and Jimmy aren't that close when infact they are, very close friends, Dave isn't really friends with them anymore because Dave died when he got in that car, a few times in the movie Jimmy and Sean make statements where they say Dave is not their friend,if you remember when Dave got home from being molested Jimmy and Sean waved at him in the window and he closed the blind that was a hint that they were not really friends anymore and at the end of the movie, Dave's name was not finished in the cement another hint that Dave was not really close with the other two. Now when Jimmy killed Dave he did feel bad but like i stated before they were not close and Jimmy is a criminal. I recommend that you go back and watch the movie look for these things and it will make perfect sense.

0316666343|4.0|When 14 year-old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered by her neighbour, Mr. Harvey, everyone is affected by this loss. Her father Jack is determined to solve the case, her mother Abigail denies the fact that Susie is gone, her brother Buckley tries to understand the concept of death and her sister Lindsey hardens herself in order to move on. But what of Susie? In Heaven she is watching the reaction of her family and friends, the police trying to find the murderer, and Mr. Harvey covering up his crime. <br />This book was very realistic and Alice Sebold does a wonderful job in portraying the everyday life of those who must try to move on and accept the fact that a loved one is gone. I am not a very sentimental person, yet I have found myself shedding a few tears while reading some intense scenes in the book. Sebold's concept of Heaven is a refreshing one after having heard about angels, clouds and wings so many times before. The members of the family each have a different way of coping with this tragic loss, which is one reason why this book seemed so realistic. <br />However, there are two reasons why I gave this book four stars instead of five: the first reason is because Alice seems to be too random. She oftens jumps back and forth from the time after Susie was murdered to the time when Susie was little. At the beginning, this was confusing and I often found myself wondering what date Susie was referring to, but after a while I started to enjoy this randomness, and it gives the story more style and a more realistic feel: I felt as if I was actually in Susie's mind, looking back on the memories she shared with her family. Nevertheless, it is still confusing and takes some getting used to.<br />The other thing I didn't like about the book was the impact Susie sometimes had on people. Sebold describes how her father saw Susie's ghost and how Ruth sometimes felt Susie's present. I don't believe in ghosts, and therefore this made the book quite incredulous at times, which was a shame.<br />All in all though, I found The Lovely Bones to be a very good book and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fresh new insight on Heaven.

0156027321|4.0|Martel spins a fascinating yarn that goes beyond the realm of imagination. The exposition moves slowly, leaving the reader to ponder where the tale is headed. However, once the plot becomes apparent, the text flows, for the most part. The seemingly simple story line of being trapped on a lifeboat is, indeed, complex. Some readers tout their religious denotation; however, no one needs to look that deeply. Read it because it's an enlightening tale that makes one wonder how anyone would endure such a crisis.
0448060191|3.0|An adorable book that may seem long at times.<br />The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war.

Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)
B0001WGDX0|5.0|This Beethoven set was the first one I purchased many years ago; I &quot;learned&quot; many of the Beethoven symphonies through Lenny and the Vienna Phil.  I couldn't have asked for better teachers.  Actually, Bernstein is more like a tour guide through the mountains. What he shows you eludes so many other conductors who supposedly rule this terrain.<br />Bernstein is often overlooked or diminished as a conductor of the standard classical reportoire, but he was often just as brilliant with Mozart or Beethoven as he could be with Mahler or the Americans.  Unlike the Sibelius or Elgar recordings from this new Bernstein Edition, his Beethoven set is a great place for anyone to begin with these works, and I still place it toe to toe with any of the other contenders.  As for those who already own other DG sets by Karajan, Abbado, or Bohm, or have legendary sets by Szell, Walter, or Furtwangler, give this one a try, especially at the bargain price, and see where Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic take you. A word of caution.  No journey through Beethoven is perfect, as every set has its mis-steps (some result in total disaster).  Bernstein's only flaw here is the Fifth, where he favors a slow and old-fashioned performance.  But this is easily remedied:  simply buy the Kleiber recording with the same orchestra, also from DG, and you will have years of great performances to relish.<br />Beethoven's name stands front and center on a golden jewel above the stage in Lenny's old stomping grounds -- Symphony Hall in Boston.  Originally, the designers were going to surround Beethoven with the names of other composers, but that never happened; they never reached a concensus on what other names were worthy to be enshrined in this symphonic crown.  So, Beethoven remains the sole jewel in the crown.  Perhaps no set of Beethoven symphonies deserves similar recognition, because there are so many other great perfomances out there.  But Bernstein's Beethoven from Vienna comes pretty damn close.n close.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Jet's first album had the potential to be a Great all rounder but they ruined it by trying to be the Beatles With their slow songs.The Uptempo Rockers are what Jet do best , I can't really get into their slow songs, Theyre quite boring and have nothing substanial About them.But The 5 Good rock songs on the album, Cold Hard Bitch, Rollover DJ, Take it or leave it, Are you gonna be my girl, Get what you need are just enough for me to enjoy the album.I'm not into slow, boring music, So ac/dc Take the cake perfectly or me. Not 1 slow/Boring song in the huge collection, Jet should Follow that lead.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Who hasn't uttered the words at one time or another &quot;I wish I were never born.&quot;  This movie seeks to explore that very possibility.  I am not quite certain I agree with the Director's answer, believing that everyone that finds him or herself on this planet is here for a very distinct reason, but bravos are most certainly in order for a most thought provoking premise of a film.  Darkly brilliant.  Thank you Ashton.  You were awesome.  Guilty pleasure my ass.  This is a powerful movie.  Watch it.  Then watch it again.
B0001I561E|5.0|There are a select few of the films made by Disney that can almost be considered essential Kid fare.  My personal faves are : Robin Hood, Lion King, and the great Aladdin.  This is one of Disney's all time greatest moments ever.  This is truly one of the best.  Adults will find it amazing, kids will love it!  An awesome and incredible tale of magic, wishes, coming of age, love, and temptation by absolute power.  Wonderful, simply wonderful.  Also was one of the first animated movies to really make use of a seamless blend of computer graphics and traditional animation styles.  Perfect.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|The term garage rock seems to loosely float around, anytime a band has vintage instruments, dirty hair, and wear scruffy attire, they're lumped into that class. So with assumptions being made that these guys are linked to The White Stripes, The Strokes, and Interpol...give them a chance, you'll be surprised. <br />  The decimal that seems to seperate these guys from their often-connected peers is their array of dazzling confidence and their ability to make something out of nothing. The foursome show hints of influence ranging from Blondie, Gang of Four and even a little Talking Heads for good measure, the overall execution works nicely. The smooth bass lines, some could contest with a statement such as - &quot;The bass is pure monotony, so much that it sounds like disco&quot;. Wait a second there, disco ??? Ok, so maybe this quartet can dish out snazzy hooks, and occassionally play around with dance-inspired rythym, but their music as a whole bends the rules a bit by including lo-fi recording (Ok so that's all they share with The Strokes) and splicing that with a good foundation of musical talent. Better yet, they actually have a singer who can sing and they don't have arrogant attitudes from hell. <br /> There must be something in the waters of Glasgow, first Mogwai then Belle and Sebastian, now Franz Ferdinand. For $12 I suggest picking this album up. A track like &quot;Dark Matinee&quot; holds such a groovy hook that will make even grandma shake her ass. It's just fun music to listen to, so what if they won't be around four or so years from now.
B000053GTK|5.0|Gentle Giant's last fully formed masterpiece never even saw a US release. This paved the way for the former Giants themselves to reissue it in this deluxe edition complete with crystal clear remastered sound plus two bonus live tracks recorded in, respectively, 1974 and 1976 during their European tours. Ironically, Gentle Giant had a larger following in the US than in Europe at the time which makes it doubly ironic that this album, perhaps their finest, never saw an &quot;offical&quot; release in the US on vinyl.<br />From the unusual percussive opening of &quot;Runaway&quot; with its use of the sound of breaking glass as the initial backbeat to the parade of recorders that sets up the stunning four part harmony of the middle eight, the opening track grabs your attention like no other Giant track before or since.<br />The odd &quot;Inmates Lullaby&quot; with its off kilter percussion and twisted nursery song melody jumps right out at you. It's an example of a band who believed in pushing the limits of what they could do musically and still not lose their audience. There isn't a weak track on the album and the inclusion of the two live tracks make this the ultimate &quot;House&quot; for fans. The sound quality varies a bit on these two live tracks (they were recorded by fans and cleaned up for release here) but the spirit and performances certainly make them worth it.<br />To top it off we get a replica of the original sleeve including the marvelous original &quot;plastic window&quot;. The inner sleeve is a replica of the original with lyrics and notes on this new edition of the album. Although GG would continue to sail at this level for a number of other albums (including the marvelous &quot;Free Hand&quot; and underrated &quot;Interview&quot;), this captured the band at their peak. Highly recommended.
B000002J09|4.0|Alright, to kick off this review I would like to assure everyone that the Avril Lavigne#1 fan was obviously a joke account satirizing modern pop culture (being 13 I can see right through this)I'm going to give a step by step review of what I think of this album:<br />Black Dog (9/10) What a great way to kick off an album! rocking riffs from Page and screaming vocals from plant define this track, a great way to get motivated.<br />Rock n' Roll (8/10) Another great track with wailing vocals from Robert Plant, the only flaw is that it can be repetitive at times, but otherwise this song is great.<br />The Battle of Evermore (9/10) A bit laidback compared to the previous two tracks but beautiful nevertheless. The lyrics with Sandy Denny's vocals add a great presence to this Zep track.<br />Stairway to Heaven (10/10)I'm going to be different in saying that this is definitely not the greatest song of all time, but it's a classic, an epic. And a song with such variety packed into less than 10 minutes has yet to be duplicated. (Especially by Slipknot)<br />Misty Mountain Hop (8/10) You cant go wrong with this one, Very interesting vocals throughout the whole of it. A bit too poppy for my tastes.<br />Four Sticks (6/10) A decent track, great drumming from Bonham throughout, but it doesn't have much else going for it.<br />Going To California (9/10) Pretty folksy for Zep. The first time I heard this on the radio i fell asleep, I know that doesn't sound complimenting but it also happened with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; by The Beatles, and it's a good thing.<br />When The Levee Breaks (8/10) A very strange sounding track that's a trip and nothing less. Heavy Blues is what I would call it.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Are you hungry for blood? Underworld is the latest attempt at re-vamping the myths about Vampires and Werewolves on screen. It presents us with a gothic tale of the \\"race-war\\" between the two species and takes a different look at the origin of both myths. In Underworld, the bloodlines of both species began as a \\"virus\\" that infects the blood, rather than the usual evolution derived from ancient mysticism and legends. This changes the perspective of the audience from the opening of the film and forces us to re-think anything we previously understood about lycanthropic and vampiric legends. It's a unique start.<br />Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity) leads the tale as Selene a vampire \\"Death Dealer\\" whose sole purpose is to execute all the \\"Lychans\\" she encounters, in the attempt to exterminate the race of Werewolves forever. The Werewolves, or \\"Lychans,\\" are led by Michael Sheen (Mary Reilly) as Lucian, whose convoluted back-story is the basis for the mysterious plot of Underworld. The third and most unique character is Michael Corvin, played by Scott Speedman (Dark Blue,) a handsome human, whom the Werewolves believe holds the key to end the war.<br />Underworld's writing is the product of a team of authors: Danny McBride, Director Len Wiseman, and Kevin Grevioux (who also starred in the film as a Lychan.) Their combined ideas formed the script with the intent of making it a full-fledged mystery, designed to unfold as the film played out. It was for that reason they deliberately did not reveal too much information at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, there is so little information revealed in the beginning, that it causes the viewer to be a bit more than perplexed. Without the benefit of a back-story and with all the new mythology being introduced so fast, so immediately, the audience has to struggle for a grip on who actually should be the hero. Although Kate Beckinsale's character Selene is introduced first, it becomes quickly apparent, that either she is an \\"anti-hero\\" or there is something distinctly amiss with her psyche. Therefore, we start to search for an alternative hero, or at least someone to identify with. Using our past knowledge of Vampire/Werewolf legends and stories, we try to glean what could possibly be the reality of the situation. However, all the rules have been changed in this film, so our archives of knowledge on Lychans and Vampires have been declared null and void.  Consequently, detecting which species is supposed to be the one to \\"root for\\" is indistinct until much later in the film. The problem with this is: at the beginning we miss a lot of the action sequences while pondering and trying to discern which species to identify with. The endless perplexity we experience detracts from the initial scenes while we try to integrate the new rules this script has postulated. If we weren't so busy contemplating heroes, we could better enjoy the action-packed sequences and spectacular effects!<br />The effects are truly something to behold. Various combinations of CGI, live action and Animatronics created new and original Werewolf transformations and Vampire agility in all manner of action sequences. There were definitely some action shots in this film that set a new precedent. Inspired by the constraints of their budget, the effects crew's ingenuity was brilliant. They came up with some amazing alternatives to standard action/effect sequences. This also affected the cinematography. To make certain shots happen, both effects team and cinematographer had to make suggestions and alterations to accommodate each other and incorporate the Director Len Wiseman's vision of bringing a graphic novel to life. Each scene is blocked and storyboarded and colored-he favors \\"blues\\" in particular-to look as if it were straight out of a comic book. The whole visual effect is stunning.<br />Despite the initial legend confusion in the opening of the film, Underworld does prove to be unique, interesting and plot-driven. Everything, from its super-fast pacing, spectacular effects, dark characters, sets, costumes and lighting, proves to be well worth watching. This film holds its own as a decadent, elegant, action flick, amidst the sea of pointless re-makes and story-starved-sequels in the action genre. Taken as a whole, Len Wiseman's distilled and surprisingly sanguine-less, cerulean vision can slake the blood thirst in any fan, hungry for action!
B00003CXXM|4.0|Robert Ludlum wrote &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; in the 1980's and it is the quintessential &quot;spy&quot; story. It is a thriller and the characters are so rich and well drawn.<br />A man is dragged from the sea. He has two bullet wounds and a &quot;chip&quot; embedded into his body. These are removed; the man recovers from this ordeal. He does not, however, remember anything, His name, where he is from from and his entire identity has been lost. He takes the chip and goes in search of himself. In a bank in Zurich he finds his identity- Jason Bourne and several other passports and lots of money. Enough information for Jason Bourne to change his identity whenever he needs to. But what does this mean?  It appears to mean that many people are after Jason Bourne, that he has information that many people want or they want this information to die!! Around every corner is danger and there is no one that he can trust. He meets up with two CIA analysts who appear to be trustworthy, but are they really?  He travels all over Europe and changes identities at every turn. He meets very interesting people at every turn. His life is full of risk and danger.  Jason Bourne is an important person with so much hidden information that he doesn't remember. But as time goes on, the people he meets share some of what he is missing, and he is beginning to put the pieces together.  He begins a love affair, and he thinks this is what he has been looking for. Why can't he be happy as a single man leaving the &quot;spy&quot; profession and finding his true love?<br />The movie stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, and he does a credible job. The action filming is wonderfully done. The car chases and the flights on foot and in trains are very real and I felt I was amongst them. I was part of the action!! Franke Potente plays Jason Bourne's love interest. Chris Cooper is the enemy and as always is a star- a cruel man who completes his job. The scenery is fantastic and brilliant. What I did miss in this movie that was not transposed from the book, is the storyline of Carlos, The Jackal. This is an important part of the book, and is not in the movie at all. Jason Bourne and Carlos have much admiratiion for each other even though they are sworn enemies. This is a significant loss, and the movie does not have the drama, background and richness of the book.  This is, however, a movie to be enjoyed- I understand the sequel, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is out this week.

B00005Q4CS|3.0|Alright the plot is simple.  A movie about four individuals who are junkies.  Three are addicted to illegal drugs and one is addicted to prescription drugs.  This movie has been done before.  But what sets it apart is how the movie reflects the four seasons.  The movie starts with the excruciating heat of summer where the four characters becomes agitated, restless, due to drugs.  Then Fall, which means when their lives starts to unravel before being doomed to the the dark uncertainties of drugs.  Winter becomes their death.  When we think of winter we think of bare tress, lifeless like the characters.  The director associated the lives of the four individuals with the four seasons.  Except at the end there is no spring because spring is hope, spring is a where life starts again.  For them there is none anymore.  A simple plot based on how we live our lives with the seasons of changes.
0060507772|5.0|There is no need for me to do yet another synopsis of this wonderfull book. If you are a Diskworld fan you already know and love all the charactors. What is differant about this book is that is has one thing that all other Diskworld books sorely lack; illustrations. Now normally I dont care for the illustrations in most novels. I prefer to visualise the charactors myself. Even the BBC Diskworld TV series didnt quite match how I see the Diskworlders in my head.<br />But Paul Kidby's illustrations truly capture the sole and essence of the denizens of the Disk. He makes the Silver Horde come to life. Especially his drawings of Evil Harry Dreads henchmen. And his rendering of Dunmanifestin is incredible. I thought how he captured Nuggin was exactly like Terry described him, and how I imagined him. I especially liked Leonards technical drawings, of which Paul captured even the finest details of the drawings done in the margins. But my personal favorite is how Kidby showed the transformation of Cohens Bard. The before and after pictures of the Bard literally brought tears to my eyes. Nothing else could have shown so well the changes brought on by traveling with Cohen and his Silver Horde. Even Terry's words fell short of Paul's drawings in this case.<br />I own two copies of all the Diskworld books. We buy the hardcover edition and read it together as a family, when the book is first released. And then we buy the paperback version, in order to protect the hardcover version, because we've all read them all so many times. I would buy them all again if they were rereleased with illustrations by Mr. Paul Kidby.<br />Thank you gentlemen, for this wonderful story and work of art.

B00005JMX6|5.0|I saw this movie by accident.  The movie that my friends and I wanted to see was sold out, and we decided to sit in on this one, mainly because Elisha Cuthbert is SMOKING!<br />Anyway, needless to say I didn't expect much of this movie.  And my was I quite pleasantly surprised.  I was amazed by the performances of Emile Hirsch and of Elisha Cuthbert, and of the ensembles as well.  Danielle's \\"pimp\\" was quite a well-played character, and I must give the actor his due (though I can't bring his name to mind right now).<br />This movie is a wonderful blend of heart, humor, fantasy (please, who wouldn't want Elisha Cuthbert to move in next door), and downright SEX APPEAL.<br />The movie keeps you enticed at all times watching the relationship between the leads develop, all the way to the VERY surprising and rewarding ending.  After this having been our begrudged fall-back, my friends and I walked out of the theater, and all we could say was, \\"Wow\\".  None of us could find more eloquent words to describe the movie.  Throughout the entire 20 minute drive from the theater, no words came to mind.<br />This movie is well worth buying.  You should probably get the soundtrack too, since it is some sweet music.

0790729628|3.0|After purchasing and viewing the DVD director's cut release, all I can think is &quot;where can I find the original theater release version&quot;.  I sat my family down to watch it two nights ago and they lost interest very quickly.  While it is still visually stunning to watch, it is not enough overcome the seeming lack of narrative/plot.  In fact, one of the key things removed from the director's cut version is the voiceover narrative by Harrison Ford's character Deckard.  For those that know the original version, it can even be a challenge to remember the significance of each scene.  For new viewers of BR, they're left wondering, scene after scene, &quot;OK what just happened and what relevance does it have to anything?&quot;.  Bring back the voiceover!
B00005AR3G|5.0|My kids watch this one all the time. My youngest just loves it, she laughs through the whole movie (and so do!)

B0001LJC2K|5.0|Those reviewers who say MUSE sounds like RADIOHEAD are missing the point.

B000065V41|5.0|My kids and I both adore this video. Around the end of November it suddenly begins to enter into our movie rotation, and we watch it a lot of times when its no where near Christmas times! And I can stand that! This movie is adorable, and a good way to expose kids to Dicken's legend. <br />I highly reccomend this!
B0001Z52RU|1.0|I am SHOCKED and almost scared that so many people LIKED this movie.  I had to turn it off when they got the part with the dog.  This is the most disturbing, worthless, junk for a movie.  While watching the parts I did manage to sit through, I hoped my small child did not walk in while I was watching it.  And I REALLY hope that as a teen he will never get his hands on it and see it.<br />I know I would NEVER want to be alone in a room with the person who thought up this terrible movie!<br />Awful awful.  This is the ONE time I do agree with the critics.<br />It is dark, depressing and horrific and that was BEFORE I even got to Ashton's charactor so it has no reflection on him.
0553103547|5.0|If I tried to sit here and describe in words how I felt about this book I would fail horribly, unfortunately Im not as good at writing as George R.R. Martin. But I can promise you if you want a world filled with Magic, Heroes, Damsels in distress, Cynical and pure evil villians and happy endings for all... then you will DETEST this book.<br />A lot of books in this genre are expected to have magic trickling through every page, but this one doesn't... heck it rarely has anything that has to do with magic, or dragons or whatnot... and when it does its makes sense! It isn't illogical out of the blue huge balls of fire flying at the enemies, its subtle, simple and dare I say, realistic (hard to refer to magic as realistic but this series pulls it off). To me this is a plus! I remember reading books by authors (who's names I will not disclose) and think to my self &quot;oh geez.. thats just a bit too much&quot; or &quot;oh c'mon, WAY too corny!&quot; but in this series, all that ever came to mind was &quot;I WANT MORE!&quot;.<br />Heroes are common in almost all books, fantasy or not. But in fantasy books heroes are usually weilding a glowing sword in one hand, a beautiful woman in the other and a dragon between their legs. Not only is this series no where near that corny, it makes it SO hard to choose sides! To many people, I can understand how this would be frustrating, but if anything it just gives you a taste of everyday life where evil and good are not black and white.<br />The villians... are there actually villians in this book? Somtimes I wonder. Its just this book has you thinking in such a philisohical and open minded way, it makes it hard for you not to relate with someone who just preforms an 'evil' deed, or at least pity them. Although some characters are hated pretty easily, overtime you may suddenly realize you are in love with them... and not understand when or how it happened! Same goes for the other way around, at one point in respect to a certain character I was thinking &quot;Oh this kid is great, will make a good man one day&quot; and later on, im not sure when, I was thinking &quot;never liked that stupid kid...&quot;<br />Also, as a warning more than anything else, be prepared for death if you read this book. There are characters who you may love, and think are amazing, that will die horrible pointless meaningless deaths. Yes I know, not a very happy ending, but not all endings have to be very happy. On the same token, there may be a villian you may be growing attatched too, and be expecting many interesting things from, who may suddenly just keel over. Again, in its own way dissapointing. But in all respects, it made the book THAT much better.<br />I know there are a few people out there who don't appreciate the sheer brilliance of this series, or they maybe dissapointed in a certain outcome. The thing is the books don't follow a predictable path lined with dandillions, bunny rabbits and a rainbow arched above, so at some points you may even be upset with George for being so mean! But after a few more pages you quickly forgive him and dive right back into the amazing plot(s). Like I said earlier... if you want predictable over the top magic, heroes that always win, illogical ideals that are always either extremely evil or extremely good... than this book series is DEFINATELY not for you. BUT if you want somthing new with an original and interesting concept, somthing that is not afraid to hurt your feelings to further the plot, somthing that makes you ponder about life itself, than this book series is DEFINATELY for you! Two thumbs up! If I had more they would be up as well.acter I was thinking &quot;Oh this kid is great, will make a good man one day&quot; and later on, im not sure when, I was thinking &quot;never liked that stupid kid...&quot;<br />Also, as a warning more than anything else, be prepared for death if you read this book.

B00004RJ71|4.0|Where to begin? Awesome cast, who portrayed every available aspect of a man's life. The ever incredibly handsome, Victor Mohica as Tio Mano,(can you believe he was 60 yrs old in this movie...incredible!!)The awesome interaction of the three main characters played by Benjamin Bratt, Jesse Borrego, and Damian Chapa. The language is foul and the violence is heavy, but it draws you into the movie as though you are living through it with a member of your own family. The language switches between english and spanish as though there is no difference, yet even if you are not bilingual, you will have no problem following this story line.<BR>   Basic's are three kids growing up in the Barrio together against all odds and in a street gang. Choices they each made sends them in three different directions in life, yet still a bond holds them together. A must see if you are able to sit through the three hours.. I would recommend this for anyone but children and teenagers, mainly because of the rough nature of the film and the violent language, and sexual content (inuendos).
B00000ILDE|1.0|This sequel to ALIEN displaces scares for &quot;action.&quot;  I got such a headache watching after the first few minutes.

B00006879E|5.0|1 - Every song on this album is a winner! There are undoubtedly a few weaker numbers but compared with the instantaneous impact of This Love, Not Coming Home and Harder To Breathe it would take something amazing to beat them.<br />2 - The immense energy coming from every song will make it very hard for you to keep from tapping your foot, tapping the steering wheel or tapping your thighs! Even on the more chilled out numbers like &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; you will be singing along for sure<br />3 - This is a very well produced album.  Each song has its own distinct sound yet it flows from beginning to end.  The sound created by the band is very unique and certainly well defined.  The vocals are delivered confidently and with such an original twist.  <br />4 - The blend of almost Motown R&amp;B with Rock is nothing new, but these guys pull it off better then I have heard before making it their own sound.  Harmonies that any Motown outfit would be proud of complete with driving percussion and guitars make this a delight!<br />5 - Songs About Jane is my favourite album of 2004 - give it a chance it will be yours before you know it!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|In The Zone - Britney's Most Shocking Album...Sexy, Revealing and exciting music!! I feel that this album really shows us a different side of Britney! <BR>1.)

VeryVery revealing! Love it! Wish it was a Single! The strings are amazing!<BR>9.) The Hook Up - Fun!<BR>10.) Shadow - Sad but up-lifting!<BR>11.) Brave New Girl - NO NO! This song does not fit on this album. It doesnt go with the new grown-up Britney Image. Very Cinderalla from Brit's 3rd CD, Britney. <BR>12.) Everytime - Very Sad/Beautiful Song though..Hilary Duffish! I find it some what immature.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The first Matrix movie was revolutionary at the time.  In retrospect, almost frustratingly so(I'm sure we're all tired of directors trying to impress us with bullet speed special effects).  However, I enjoyed it.  It was good science fiction, and the premise was interesting.<br />Now, in the second Matrix, it was painfully obvious that the directors were thinking throughout the entire process &quot;man, in the first movie, they liked it when we did this.  So lets do it A LOT!&quot;  However, despite a weak first hour, and a lackluster ending, it still eeked out an hour of entertainment (especially the incredible car chase scene).<br />And here, the last arrives, and it is not a good thing.  They stopped trying to hide the fact that they were ripping off the first two movies.  You see Neo fight Smith, start losing, get kicked into a wall, dramatic music plays, Smith looks triumphant.  Neo gets up, Smith looks startled, Neo brushes himself on, and does a kung fu move to say &quot;bring it on&quot;.<br />That doesn't sound familiar AT ALL, does it?<br />I was almost chuckling at the absurdity of it.  It looked like they were trying to duplicate the lobby scene of the first film, only have it with programs who walk ON THE CEILING!  The movie tries, and fails to be cerebral.  The first film kept it more down to earth, and later on, it tried adding the mystical aspects to the approach, and it fails.  And the ending is frustrating in itsself, only serving to remind those of us who didn't pick it up that Neo is supposed to be a Christ-figure.<br />I won't get started on the acting... basically, this film loses all acting, plot, or originality that the first had, and the second had to a lesser extent.  This is the lowest wrung of a series which got worse at each attempt.  I'm not giving it 1 star just because there are a few action scenes and plot points that aren't COMPLETELY contrived.  But not many.  I can't recommend this film.
B00004T8RK|5.0|(Actual Rating-4.5 Stars)<br />Binaural(2000). Pearl Jam's Sixth Album, and the First to Feature Drummer Matt Cameron.<br />As the 90's came to a close, Pearl Jam was still an anomaly in Popular Music, having their first huge hit single,&quot;Last Kiss&quot;, since Ten under their belts, Pearl Jam ignored trends and kept on shelling out albums based on their style. Pearl Jam was the only original Grunge Band left, and despite the music scene dominated by such junky bands as Limp Bizkit and N'Sync, Pearl Jam stuck to their roots and never once strayed from their music, much like Metallica and The Stone Temple Pilots. So, along with the guitar mastery of Stone Gossard and Mike McCready(I will refer to them as &quot;The Duo&quot; in my review), the Undeniable Vocal Talents of Eddie Vedder, the bass talents of Jeff Ament, and Former- Soundgarden Drummer Matt Cameron, Pearl Jam was ready to rock! So, is 'Binaural' a classic album along the lines of Pearl Jam's first three albums, or a decent album by a washed up band? Read My Review To Find Out....<br />Track Listing-<br />Breakerfall- &quot;The Duo&quot;'s opening riff clearly shows the influence of The Who, and &quot;Breakerfall&quot; uses Vedder's slightly distorted vocals to his full extent. Good Alt Rock song, but way too short!<br />God's Dice- &quot;God's Dice&quot; combines stellar drumming from Cameron, the melodic vocals of Vedder, and Reggae-tinged riff to make a short but sweet Alt. Rock song.<br />Evacuation- &quot;Evacuation&quot; is an odd number, combining influences of Psychadelia, Funk, and Alt. Rock, very much like 'Vs.'s &quot;N.W.A.&quot;, and uses Vedder's vocals on the chorus to create an undeniably great and catchy song.<br />Light Years- &quot;Light Years&quot; is a great ballad, mixing a heartbroken riff from &quot;The Duo&quot; with Vedder's somber vocals to create a melodic yet rocking ballad. Great song!<br />Nothing As It Seems- &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; starts off with a VERY doomy riff, along with Vedder's low and frightening vocals make this a spooky song. The Chorus, the insane solos(note the 's') make this a slow, yet ultimately rewarding song. Horrifyingly good!<br />Thin Air- &quot;Thin Air&quot; is another ballad, and Pearl Jam mixes a tinge of Country and Folk, yet keeps enough Alt. Rock to still make it a good song. Great vocals and guitarmanship!<br />Insignificance- &quot;Insignifacance&quot; is a cross between a ballad and Heavy Metal, because &quot;The Duo&quot;'s dark riff mixes with Eddie Vedder's very melodic vocals, making for an excellent experiment. Great guitar work and a killer chorus!<br />Of The Girl-&quot;Of The Girl&quot; shows Pearl Jam experimenting once more, adding influences of New Age and Jazz onto a ballad. Although Vedder's vocals are great, and the Jazzy Guitarwork from &quot;The Duo&quot; is very good, ultimately &quot;Of The Girl&quot; comes out rather boring. A Decent Song.<br />Grievance- &quot;Grievance&quot; is a mix between Heavy Metal and Punk, using &quot;The Duo&quot;'s hard as hell and punk influenced riff behind Vedder's melodic, yet angry vocals to make &quot;Grievance&quot; an undeniably good song! Excellent Guitar Work!<br />Rival- &quot;Rival&quot; is obviously influenced by Led Zeppelin, using &quot;The Duo&quot;'s Jimmy Page-y riff and bluesy solo behind a steady keyboard beat that complements Vedder's sarcastic vocals. Great song!<br />Sleight Of Hand- &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; starts off slow, with Vedder softly singing, but soon &quot;The Duo&quot;'s distorted, Heavy, and Dark riff sweeps in. &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; is slow during interludes, yet it gets VERY hard in some parts. Overall a good song!<br />Soon Forget- &quot;Soon Forget&quot; is a filler song, yet Vedder's vocals and the almost-not-there ukelele make &quot;Soon Forget&quot; a nice touch to the album, though don't be expecting a song.<br />Parting Ways- Before Pearl Jam parts ways with us, they dish out &quot;Parting Ways&quot;. &quot;Parting Ways&quot; uses &quot;The Duo&quot;'s Middle-Eastern tinged riff with Vedder's comforting vocals to create a very soothing song.<br />Overall, 'Binaural' is a very good album, and undoubtedly one of Pearl Jam's best! Pearl Jam uses very original techniques here, implementing touches of Folk, Blues, Jazz, New Age, Country, Heavy Metal, and Alternative Rock to show they are one of the most consistently original bands around. I can't give Binaural 5 stars, simply because so many of the songs are short(ex. &quot;Breakerfall&quot;, &quot;God's Dice&quot;, &quot;Evacuation&quot;) and &quot;Of The Girl&quot; and &quot;Soon Forget&quot; aren't all that great, hence the 4.5 Star Rating.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! PEARL JAM CONTINUES TO ROCK AFTER ALL THESE YEARS! ALTHOUGH NOT AS GOOD AS PEARL JAM'S FIRST 3 ALBUMS, 'BINAURAL' IS STILL A GOOD ALBUM AND I RECOMMEND IT TO FANS OF ROCK IN GENERAL, ESPECIALLY PEARL JAM AND GRUNGE FANS!<br />Also Recommended-<br />Vs.-Pearl Jam<br />Ten-Pearl Jam<br />Siamese Dream- Smashing Pumpkins<br />Thanks For Reading!uot;. &quot;Parting Ways&quot; uses &quot;The Duo&quot;'s Middle-Eastern tinged riff with Vedder's comforting vocals to create a very soothing song. <br />Overall, 'Binaural' is a very good album, and undoubtedly one of Pearl Jam's best!

B0000214F0|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out in the movie theatre. I have been waitng since then to purchase the movie. I almost bought it on VHS about 10 years ago but wasn't prepared to pay $80 then. This is a must see. It has one of the best story lines of any movie in recent history. Oh the sex scenes aren't too bad either.

Director, operator and main actor did their best. But all this hysteria about move is just a very, very good entertainment and marketing. (Bravissimo, marketing heads!)<br />If you realy want to think about \\"great and eternal\\" things, watch Antonioni, Pasolini,  Scorsese, Bergman, De Sica etc. works.<br />Even \\"Finding Nemo\\" is more about faith, than Gibson's movie.
B0000062FL|5.0|There are some people who believe that Carlos Santana does not belong in the same company as Clapton and Hendrix. These people include Santana himself. He is dead wrong. Not only is Santana's stellar guitar work on par with both men but he frequently surpassed them. While others were content to wring chords out of the blues, Santana  leaped for the stratsophere with an older vision: more tribal, more latin, more african and in the end created a music that was paradoxically, both past and future at once. Don't think that Hendrix didn't notice. Abraxas is where it came together for the first time. The abstract songs are the best, but it's telling that a throwaway like &quot;Hope You're Feeling Better,&quot; still out-Claptons all of Layla. Carlos did not sing (unlike Clapton and Hendrix), but that only made his guitar more urgent than ever. It had to be, it was his only voice. Hard to believe that American tastes were so sophisticated once, but this was one of the biggest selling albums of the seventies.
B00002E224|4.0|I loved this movie or all the reasons stated by the other reviewers but beware those who buy this DVD-unbelievably the ONLY extra is the trailer. If you can tape it off a TV showing you won't be losing anything.
B000067FP8|5.0|I'm not saying this just because I am a New Yorker, but GREMLINS 2--THE NEW BATCH is slightly better than the original. First, it's a much less mean-spirited film than the first (which I also gave five stars, but for different reasons). Just the fact that a character who was crushed to death in the first film, shows up in the sequel (wearing a small cast) because he really was likeable, shows that Joe Dante and the scriptwriters were going into this film for the fun of it. Second, the casting was flawless. Whoever chose Tony Randall to do the voice of the strangely-William F. Buckley-sounding, intellectual gremlin was responding to nothing short of divine inspiration. Everyone involved in this production had their hearts in the right places and the effect shows. GREMLINS 2--THE NEW BATCH is an astounding piece of comic fantasy and horror that should endure.
0486237664|5.0|It took me 10 years but I finally own it. I fell in love with the pictures in this book in 7th grade art class.
B000067FP7|5.0|1) Buy GREMLINS. 2) Watch GREMLINS 3) Repeat #2 several times<br />Every time I surf the t.v. and I come across GREMLINS, I will put down the remote and watch it til the end. GREMLINS, for its time, was truly groundbreaking. It was E.T., except with really rotten friends and relatives. Well-paced and directed Joe Dante, with unique performances by Zach Galligan and the gorgeous  Phoebe Cates, GREMLINS deftly treads in and out of suspense/horror and comedy. (Phoebe Cates' explication of how her father died is still outrageous.) And there are plenty of pitched battles between the good guys and the unruly gremlins to keep the plot moving. Just don't show this movie to young kids around Christmastime.<br />This special edition has a lot of goodies that true GREMLINS fans will enjoy, and the quality is top-notch. Just don't get it wet.
B0000E2FLC|2.0|I picked up this concert DVD on a recommendation from a friend. I was interested to see this newly re-masteded concert, so I fired up my home theatre and gave this DVD a spin. I only made it half way through before turning it off, the sound was good, but there is no way that this was a live sound, my guess is that the sound was either re-recorded or re-dubbed and it left me with the impression that you were listening to a CD! and not a live concert. Second, the so called re-mastered picture was also a disappointment, there was too much grain and artifacts present that it gave the feel of watching an old film projected image from my days at high school! Overall, I was not impressed and this concert is only from 1991, so there is no reason why the film and sound quality should be this poor. I have seen many concerts on DVD that were either this age or older and they looked spectacular!
B000099T2L|2.0|Depending on why you were a destiny's child fan to begin with, you will either love this album or hate it.<br />I became a fan when DC did the survivor album because they had a diverse amount of the background sounds/instruments and lyrical topics (like they really do love each other like family, people need to get their act together, you need to find god, true love is the best, and last but not least you need to party too). DC was also really good at being totally serious on a song and then being really cheesy (but have it still be fun to listen to) on another song.<br />Before this album came out I was really hyped up for it because Beyonce did a big chunk of producing and writing for the survivor album.<br />Since the survivor album was the first time she did most of the behind the scenes work I assumed this album would be similar in terms of what kind of vibe you got from it.<br />Man was I wrong, on most of the singles she is in Foxy Cleopatra mode (what she did in Austin Powers). It was cool to see that routine in the movie (because that was a comedy), but not on here (this wasn't supposed to be a comedy). Another major problem is most of the songs that were not ever on the radio are really bland ballads that are totally forgetable.<br />The sad thing is whenever you see Beyonce in interviews she is one of the few celebrities that really does come off as smart, kind, sexy, and mature. But if all you knew about her was from this album you wouldn't think this because way too many of the songs don't project that kind of feeling at all. Because of this the songs things sound contrived or really cheesy (in a bad way) most of the time (Naughty Girl is the worst offender, I laugh uncontrolably every time I hear that song).<br />So here is the final verdict, if all you are looking for is some songs to play at a party or you follow only top 40 stuff then get this or some compilation CD that has her singles (seriously, you will probably love it). If you are looking fora great album that you will continue to play years from now then avoid this and buy DC's Survivor album if you don't already have it.
B000002HPT|4.0|Ok from what I've noticed, everyone seems to blame the newcomer Derek Sherinian for this lame excuse of a living album that Dream theater has created. I admit, one of my favourite keyboardist, Jordan Rudess has finally joined DT to really shred the technicality to a whole different level. <br />Setting that aside is the fact that this album truly does suck. It bought shame upon the whole dream theater community and they lost many fans instead of bringing them in. Dream theater's record company, Elecktra forced DT to create a standarized, more &quot;commercialized&quot; album this time around. Bad luck for Sherinian since he came in when this started.<br />When Sherinian first came up to this band he was supposed to be a temporary member until they recruited virtuoso Rudess. But since Rudess still had a few things left with Dreg, DT had no choice to pick up Sherinian. Immediatly they began to record the record &quot;A change of Season&quot; with Sherinian and does anyone give him credit for that? I'm pissed off that nobody gives Sherinian the correct recognition.<br />True to this, many of these songs on this album blows...especially that pansy ass song &quot;Anna Lee&quot; I mean come on...this kind of ballad does NOT belong to dream theater. Nobody knows but when Sherinian came up board they already began making the outlines around Metropolis 2. But of course Elecktra had to force them to create a commercialized album. Who here has ever seriously heard of Derek shred the keyboards? Buy his solo albums along with Planet X and you'll see how much of a player he really is. You can even distinguish him from a lot of other keyboardist.<br />Plus why does nobody give credit to Derek for creating &quot;Sand in a line?&quot; Read the booklet and you'll see that it was created by him. That other guy only did the backing vocals, complimenting Labrie's already beautiful soaring voice. The only thing that people are nowadays is that they are ignorant. Doing no research of theperson and down right criticizing them...In my opinion I would say that Rudess &gt; Moore &gt; Derek around the technicality parts but when it comes to showmenship and plain out &quot;soul and melodic&quot; playing then Derek beats all people.

1572814349|5.0|I was always told that I couldn't just go out and find a Tarot deck, that it would have to come to me.  Well after a year of casually browsing and buying some absolutely horrible duds, I walked into a local bookstore and found this deck staring at me from a shelf.  I am so in love.  It's incredibly beautiful, with rich symbolism that evokes you to find your own reflections.  The accompanying book is very well-written and helpful, and has aided me immensely in my study of these cards.  I *would* recommend this to everyone I know, but I still like feeling special as the one with the best deck by far :)
B00005Q66T|4.0|The amazon.com reviewer is right. This compilation is missing two great singles &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; and &quot;American Pie.&quot;  Another complaint is that the single radio version (Miami Remx) of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; is not included--it's the soundtrack album version. But still a good buy for Madonna fans. A-
0783114222|5.0|HBO's \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" (E2M) is everything a good docu-drama mini-series should be. Tom Hanks has brought to life the true story of man's greatest adventure to \\"land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth\\". For those of us who were alive, E2M allows us to relive those incredible days. And for those who were born afterwards, it gives them a chance to understand exactly what it was they missed. If you have even the slightest interest in the space program, obtaining a copy of this DVD set is a must.<br />Coincidently, Apollo 11 landed exactly 35 years ago today. I was 13 years old at the time and living in Nova Scotia, Canada. The \\"Eagle\\" touched down at 5:17 pm, much to the consternation of my mother who was busy trying to prepare supper. Just like Tom Hanks would later relate, I had my models of the Command Service Module, Lunar Module and Saturn V rocket close at hand while I had claimed the living room armchair for the occasion. My family gathered around our old B&W television which was tuned to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), one of only two stations which were available to us back then. Much of the CBC's coverage consisted of a feed from CBS, so we got to watch Walter Cronkite's famous \\"Oh Boy!\\" commentary. My prized 3\\" reel-to-reel tape recorder (you could get all of 1 hour on a single reel) was busy taping a local radio station carrying NBC's coverage with Jay Barbree. <br />The entire family congregated again a few hours later for the moonwalk, just before midnight, and watched Neil & Buzz's first steps. I stayed up for the entire 30 hour televised stretch, from lunar landing to liftoff, stealing a moment every now and then to go outside and gaze up in wonder at the moon, filled with awe that two human beings were actually there, living and working on its surface. In this day of CNN and other all-news networks, it should be remembered that the coverage of this event was in itself history in-the-making - TV's longest continuous coverage of a planned event. <br />My interest in space began with the flight of Apollo 8. When I heard that this was the first manned launch of the world's biggest rocket, the Saturn V, I was sure that one of its million parts would go wrong with disastrous results. Thank God it didn't. I watched and I was forever hooked. A real space junkie, religiously watching each mission after that, coaxing my Mom to let me stay home from school (recurrent cases of \\"moon sickness\\", no doubt), clipping out every newspaper, Life, Time or Newsweek article I could find (now faded yellow with age) and trying to tape as much of the audio coverage as I could (few private individuals could afford a video recorder back then). By Apollo 14, I had earned enough money working at a grocery store to buy a 4-track 7\\" reel-to-reel recorder (which allowed one to put up to 12 hours on a single tape!) and had built a 15\\" Heathkit color TV. For Apollo 16, I had added a new-generation \\"cassette\\" recorder to my arsenal (don't forget that the venerable 8-track was still popular at the time). And, of course, I had acquired a VCR by the time the first Space Shuttle flew in 1981. It has always annoyed me that the more recording resources I could afford, the less TV & radio coverage there was available to tape. <br />But the effect of the Apollo program on me was profound. Because of it, I entered into a career in radio astronomy, enjoying the technical challenge of building instruments to investigate deep space from the Earth, perhaps recognizing the likelihood that I would never have to opportunity to leave its surface (although I did make the first cut for the Canadian Astronaut Program nearly 20 years ago). In tribute to Project Apollo, we named our son (now 16) after astronaut David Scott who commanded Apollo 15, my favorite of all the lunar flights. <br />In many ways, I feel sorry for the children of today - they will never experience the monumental awe and global celebration that we were privileged to witness back in 1969. Strange, isn't it, that although Apollo - the pinnacle of mankind's technical achievement - which occurred only 35 years ago is now looked on as though it was something out of our deep past rather than a part of our future. It's almost treated like it was a chapter out of ancient history, similar to other great accomplishments like the building of the Pyramids or the Great Wall. Although it might not seem so today, 500 years from now the moon landings will undoubtedly be remembered as the most significant event to have occurred in the 20th century. <br />It's hard to choose my favorite E2M episode since they were all so good. As an engineer, \\"Spider\\" resonated well with me, portraying the passion and dedication which many of us put into our work, albeit for projects with a much lower profile. \\"That's All There Is\\" brought back fond memories of the Apollo 12 mission. I distinctly remember there was talk at the time that astronauts Conrad and Bean may have been on an accidental oxygen high. It's good to know that there effervescent behavior on the surface was just a manifestation of their normal high spirits and comradery. I was delighted at how \\"Galileo Was Right\\" was able to present the training of the astronauts to be field-geologists in such an entertaining and informative manner. And finally, the bittersweet \\"Le Voyage Dans La Lune\\" brought a tear to my eye, just as happened back in 1972 when I watched Apollo 17 and the last lunar module lift-off from the moon. It's even sadder still, that we have not returned, nor will we for perhaps another 20 years.
B0000CFW87|1.0|What the world needs now is NOT an opera version of Clay Aiken! or should I say opera-wannabe version.  Do yourself a favor and get the &quot;Cabaret&quot; soundtrack of the movie for some REAL MUSICAL TALENT. F-(-)
B0002234LS|4.0|I didn't even want to watch this movie. I wasn't compelled to see it in the theater and I wasn't enthusiastic about it once the DVD showed up in the house.<br />But then I watched the first fifteen minutes . . . and, well, it got interesting.  As others have noted, Depp's acting is, as usual, superb.  The man is one of the best actors we have at this time.  And the story does pull you in.  The characters are well drawn (as is the case with most King novels) and viewers will want to see what happens to them as the story progresses.<br />However, the story itself and Stephen King's reputation are part of the problem.<br />&quot;Secret Window&quot; was based on a King novella within the larger work &quot;Four Past Midnight.&quot;  For some reason, King's novellas and shorter novels (Stand By Me, Shawshank, The Shining, Carrie) have translated the best to film while his longer works (The Stand, Tommyknockers) are utterly horrible.  Given this track record, &quot;Secret Window&quot; should have been one of the better King movies.  The problem here is that &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot; was never an example of King's better work.  Thus, in a sense, the director has to rescue the movie from the perception of King as the &quot;master of horror.&quot;  When you have the deck stacked against you like that it's hard to come through with the goods.  &quot;Secret Window&quot; is basically a love triangle in which one of the characters goes nuts.  A plausible story, but it's difficult to present a story as routine as this is in a manner that will satisfy the hype.<br />&quot;Secret Window&quot; is a good movie.  It's just not great.  And it's certanly not worthy of all the King hype.  Still, it's worth a look.  Depp's acting is especially worth watching.  And the story, if you're in the mood, is a bit scary at times.<br />As for the DVD, it's also worth a look.  The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the featurette sequences are interesting, more so in fact than most such extras on other DVDs.  Far too often we get DVDs which show us scene after boring scene showing us the technical aspects of how a movie was filmed.  Here we at least get a brief glance at some of the human interest aspects behind the camera. I would have liked to have seen an interview with the author, but that seems to be a rarity amongst all DVDs.  I think that all movies adapted from books should have this extra feature (assuming the author is still alive).
0671027387|3.0|I just finished Deception Point, and albeit a well written novel that raced along at &quot;Dan Brown speed&quot;, I couldn't help but feel disappointment in the story itself. I loved Angels and Demons, but this novel lacked the mystery element that A&amp;D had. I also thought the characters a bit hooky...but hey it is a novel of fun, not literature. I will say that Mr. Brown does a great job, in bringing new tech ideas to the forefront. I know you will hate me for saying this, but I can't help it.

B000286SCO|5.0|DT fans, I have been waiting for Live from Tokyo to come out on DVD for since DVD players were on the market. I have had the VHS for the Tokyo show for at least 7 years now. It's my opinion that this was one of their best shows ever recorded. I have seen them many times, even before James joined DT when When Dream and Day Unite was just an import and when Kevin Moore was with them and I have to say that the Tokyo show just rocks. There were all in their prime then. The 2nd DVD in the set is just awesome as well. I was really pleased that they included members of Yes, Marillion and Napalm Death playing with them. I paid about 29.00 for the VHS on the Tokyo show on VHS back in the day, now only half the price and with a 2nd DVD. For the price, you cannot pass this up!
B00005JKNC|3.0|Didn't anyone notice how derivative this movie is? The whole plot screams of Marin Guerre. And the scene in front of the HUAC was lifted straight from The Front (Woody Allen was a little more colorful). They even had the guy who went to a communist party meeting strictly to score with a girl. (It was Zero Mostel in the original movie.) <br />As for the ending... c'mon everybody sing! &quot;Now the whole damn bus is cheering, and I can't believe I see... a hundred yellow ribbons round the old... oak... tree!&quot;
B0001FGBL6|5.0|It pains me to see bands like this not getting the recognition they deserve.  This album is just plain awesome.  It has an epic scope to it that makes it seem like a soundtrack.  It's refreshing to see bands coming about that take classical elements and use them with metal.  This is a stand-out album in a sea of Gothic mediocrity.  It reminds me of Nightwish in a way, but there are more choir and orchestra here.  The album takes you on a wonderful ride.  If you're new to Gothic or metal music, you might find some of the male guttural singing a bit annoying, but I like to think it complements the soft female voice---plus it's just one of the many aspects of metal singing.  Don't miss this album.  It's a winner!
B0000C8AVR|5.0|A rock album from our Boy, hmm?<br />Dylan has guitar flash Mike Bloomfield along for this ride, and he adds jets to this whole shebang.  If you want to hear Dylan rock, really rock, then you need this album.  Forget all the lyrical tricks, the hidden meanings, and just get it because it is electric, it has guitars, and they go fast.<br />It also has maybe the best rock song of all time, &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;.  From the opening rim shot to the last note, it is a classic's classic.  &quot;How does it FEEL?&quot; asks Dylan, as he takes a former debutante to the woodshed after her world falls in.  Misogynistic?  Maybe, but so what?  It is an awesome track.<br />&quot;Desolation Row&quot; features two harmonica solos that rise the hair on your arms.  The song gradually builds in its stridency, until Dylan can hardly keep from shouting the words. He solos one time, comes back with the last verse in a voice almost shaking in its intensity, then solos again to put an ending to this great, great album.  Woof.<br />In between these two songs lies a set of perhaps the greatest collection of music ever put onto record.  If you are a folkie, and electric music makes you nervous, then I'm sure you prefer an earlier Dylan album, or maybe &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.  If you are a rock and roll person, this disc is the one.
B000267JQK|5.0|Ive been into Seether since the debut and they still rock. Alot of people are commenting on his voice sounding alot like Kurts. Well I just got back from a concert where seether opened for Evanescence and he sang the song &quot;you know your right&quot; and it sounded amazing! Anyways the cd is a filler but a worthy filler. If your a true fan or maybe just getting into them buy this cd.
B00005JLR8|4.0|This story, about an Irish family that immigrates to Manhattan after the death of a son, is a sweet film about family, loss and new beginnings.  <br />What I liked best about the movie were the very strong performances by the two young girls and the neighbor, Mateo.  <br />On the down side, I sometimes found the Irish accents hard to understand and details were sometimes unrealistic.<br />The story wasn't strong enough for me to consider it outstanding, but it's an interesting watch, a nice change of pace from Hollywood and a good family film.
0688170528|5.0|My friend was supposed to read this book for school, so I found it in his backpack while we were in Europe.<br />For the next two days after, I read it all the time.  No matter where we were.  The bus, the lobby of the hotel waiting for everyone, lunch, etc.  I sat up one night until 2:45 reading.<br />I loved how it went from Past to Present.  And the twist at the end, really makes it interesting.
B0000027F8|4.0|&quot;Faith&quot; may have been the album that made him a superstar, but I think this is the album I listen to and enjoy more. There are still pop jams and ballads, but it feels more consistent than the previous album did. Also, unlike &quot;Faith&quot;, this disc feels more timeless and removed from the 80's, even though it was released just in 1990. &quot;Praying For Time&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot; are two of his best songs ever, and they both start off the album. &quot;Waiting For That Day&quot; and &quot;Heal The Pain&quot; are two great upbeat tracks, while a song like &quot;Mothers Pride&quot; is beautiful and moving. I find &quot;Older&quot; to be similar to &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot;, but not quite as good. Overall my favorite of his, and I still listen to it often.

B000002MUN|4.0|\\"Full Moon Fever\\" may have been more popular, but I think this is at least as good. Actually this has a few hits of it's own. \\"It's Good To Be King\\" and \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\" were both singles. Other strong songs are \\"You Wreck Me\\", \\"Cabin Down Below\\", \\"A Higher Place\\", and the title song. In fact, every track here is very good, or excellent. \\"Wildflowers\\" is even more essential to own when you consider that neither of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections include any of these songs (different label). I'd say if the casual fan gets one album after a \\"Hits\\" disc, it's got to be this one. I might even get this first it's so good.

1559409002|1.0|It sounds cheap.  It looks cheap.  There was nothing scary or entertaining about it.  The plot doesn't make sense.  People talk to her, everything blurs then they don't see or hear her.  Dumb.  I had to force myself and my friends to watch it.  I love old horror films but this one was a dud.  I don't understand the reviews saying how great this movie is.  Don't waste your money.
B000002UKS|5.0|&quot;Colour and the Shape&quot; is plain and simply one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Dave Grohl's musical genius should never be discounted, and his talents far surpass almost anyone in the business today - simply put, he is a living legend.  CATS is simply awesome, from the mellow opener 'Doll' to the sonic assault that is 'Monkeywrench'.  Sonic assault is the perfect word to describe this album.  The setup is interesting, as it goes from a series of short songs, that lead up to big ones.  'Up In Arms' is one of the small songs (great one at that) but its message and length is perfect as the drum intro to 'My Hero' begins.  The last 4 tracks are an absolute treat and 'Everlong', 'Walking After You', and 'New Way Home' is about a strong a 1-2-3 punch to finish of an album as I have ever seen, rivaled by none other.  &quot;Colour and the Shape&quot; is an absolutely essential album.  Many years from now, the ripples left behind by Dave Grohl will be alongside names such as Dylan, Lennon, and Morrison, as the true legends of rock music.  Very highly recommended.
B000092Q4U|5.0|After what I thought was the demise of good metal in the '90's, along comes Lamb of God with this album. This is some of the hardest, rawest stuff I have ever heard. Blythe's growling, angry vocals are also amazing, and unlike on their debut (New American Gospel), his voice adds to the heaviness. <br />It's not all just the music, either. The lyrics on this CD stand out as cynical, rage-inspired, downright beautiful pieces of poetry. These guys have a talent for turning old cliches into irony; there are phrases on the CD you wouldn't expect to hear in metal. Listen to my personal favorite, &quot;Boot Scraper&quot;, to see what I mean.<br />If you like pure brutality and grindcore, this CD is probably not for you. It's melodic and heavy without being over-the-top, which is what I like about it. All in all, I have to say this is one of the best metal albums I've ever heard. I'd rank it right up there with Carcass's Heartwork or Megadeth's Rust in Peace.
B000268QB2|5.0|I wandered the NYC Virgin Megastore one night hoping to find a new band to win my heart.  After just one listen, I knew this band was special.  Yes, there are similarities to Travis and ColdPlay, but, those similarities are only related to how catchy and easily these songs take hold.  Keane has their own sound, heck, they don't even have a guitarist.  I saw them play in NYC and then flew to Amsterdam just two weeks ago to see them again and both shows were incredibly powerful and memorable.  The energy emitted from this trio is out of the ordinary and the stage presence of the lead singer is nothing shy of perfect.  If Keane can put out an excellent sophomore effort and mix it with the right promotions, they should be a great success!  BUY THE CD AND THEN RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW!  I've been doing that ever since making the purchase.  Thanks for the wonderful music!
B000002LE6|2.0|Through out the 80's, Princes' standard in artistry and production was nothing short of amazing. \\"alphabet st.\\", \\"dance on\\", \\"love-sexy\\" and \\"I wish u heaven\\", were all strong tracks with much potential. The finishing result was a 45 minute mish-mash of noise that has destroyed the joy of listening to these four particular songs. The mastering process of the album, resulted in one single track (very unusual) (that's prince), but overall, the album sounds awful. Many of the tracks are mixed together, with no definitive track boundaries, with \\"over the top\\" production work, which becomes somewhat annoying. Prince would have been much better off to release these four tracks on an EP, with distinctive silent gaps between the tracks. This would have given all four tracks their distinct individuality, deepening the experience that each track is conveying. On a finishing note, this was one messy album to listen to, with no depth. This was the beginning of Princes' decline

B00023B1LC|3.0|Okay, I'm writing this because I feel that I've been burned. I just purchased the 2004(?) re-release of this DVD and I was very disappointed. The package describes an &quot;explosive extended edition&quot; and &quot;includes an all-new beginning and ending&quot;. I've got to admit that I loved the movie when it was in the theatres, and am happy that it is now in my collection, but I never would have bought it had I known the hype was so lame. The 'explosive' new beginning and ending were NOT, and really add nothing to the movie (I won't 'spoil' the 'surprise' for those die-hard fans). Plus they couch the reasons for excluding them from the theatrical release in some 9/11 mumbo-jumbo that was not clearly defined enough to understand. I think it's just a marketing ploy. If you're looking for a major addition to the original in this new release...please say, &quot;I wasn't Bourne yesterday!&quot;
B00005ASHM|5.0|Well, Pet Sounds may not be the best album of all time, but the best isn't the Beatles' Revolver either.  There just aren't enough good songs on Revolver to stand up to Wouldn't It Be Nice, Don't Talk, God Only Knows, Caroline No, and the great harmonies of Sloop John B.  At the other end of the spectrum, Pet Sounds has nothing near as bad as Yellow Submarine. So, the argument just doesn't add up. Oh, and, neither does it work for Sgt. Pepper (gag) or Rubber Soul (yawn).
B0000027RL|5.0|Not so often, have I seen and heard so much good music on one record. I got the album two years after it was released and it was like an explosion, literally, at least for me. I was a little bit sceptical at the beginning, especially not liking Nirvana, but so surprised after hearing it. It was nothing like anything I heard before. The music is absolutely absorbing, breathtaking and soulful at the same time, great guitar playing, good rock with still enough rhythm to be listened to by the crowd. Not to talk about Eddie Vedder's voice and his way of singing. The first time I heard Alive I couldn't believe anybody can have a voice like that and can sing a great and said story like Jeremy or deeply personal lyrics like Alive or Black so well. Truly amazing. I would recommend this album to absolutely everybody who appreciates good music, good lyrics, and great voice. Probaly the best voice....

B00005A46T|3.0|Every generation gets the heavy metal heroes it deserves. <br /> The hedonistic '70s produced Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. The superficial '80s gave us Moetley Cruee and Poison. And now, the violent, dysfunctional days of this new millennium have given us the frightening Slipknot, the new Antichrist superstars of disaffected teens everywhere. <br /> We should not be surprised by their popularity. Everything about this nine-member troupe from Des Moines is tailor-made to appeal to surly adolescents. Start with the look, which is, after all, just as important to kids as the music: The members perform in identical industrial coveralls. They wear freaky-creepy horror-movie masks. They go by single-digit numbers instead of names. Think about it: Anonymity, withdrawal from conventional society, the creation of a fearful new persona, a sense of belonging to a rebellious and powerful group -- what more could your average teen want except a side of fries? <br /> In Slipknot's case, that would be the music -- a monstrously heavy and explosively destructive cacophony of pain and mayhem more akin to the blackest European death metal than the comparatively benign rap-rock of Limp Bizkit. Searing sheets of guitars, pummeling waves of maniacally frenzied rhythm, nuclear-powered bass guitars and tortured vocals that veer from a guttural growl to a white-hot primal scream are the main ingredients in this recipe. And it's all served up with a bottomless lyrical cup of bitter psychotic rage. The message is simple: Slipknot hate everything about society. And everybody in it. Us, themselves, you -- especially you. <br /> Amazingly enough, they're even more pissed off on their second major-label album Iowa than they were on their eponymous 1999 debut. That album was like a middle finger stuck in the face of the world; this one is more like a fist heading towards your skull. On shiny, happy tunes with titles like People = S--, My Plague, I am Hated and New Abortion, Slipknot make their intentions graphically clear: They don't just want you to clear off. They want to stab you, bathe themselves in your blood and have sex with your corpse. We are not hyperbolizing. \\"I wanna slit your throat and f-- the wound / I wanna push my face in and feel the swoon,\\" bellows vocalist No. 8 on the devastating Disasterpiece, one of the 14 violence-drenched assaults in this hour-long session of brutality. And you thought Marilyn Manson was evil? <br /> Slipknot may not be evil but they're damned clever. The warning sticker on this CD (at least on the review copy we got) is stuck to the outer plastic wrapper, so kids who buy it can remove it before they get home. As much as we hate those stickers and the censorship they represent, that sneaky tactic concerns us. Slipknot's Iowa is an album every responsible parent should hear, both by themselves and with their kids. Not to try to dissuade teens from listening to Slipknot -- frankly, these songs are so relentlessly over the top and indistinguishably one-dimensional that even kids should get bored of them pretty quick. But adults might want to point out to the young 'uns that Slipknot is selling rebellion the same way McDonald's sells those fries. And that while their horrifically violent reactions to life and its evils make for excellent cathartic fantasies -- and we all have them -- they aren't to be confused with reality. <br /> Otherwise, we suspect it's only a matter of time until another confused, neglected kid listens to a disc like this, picks up a weapon and screws up a whole bunch of lives. And if we as a society just let that happen, it will be just what we deserve.

B00000IQC8|5.0|This has to be my all time favorite comedy and one of my all time favorites overall. About three years ago a friend of mine came to school one day raving about the funniest movie he had seen on late night. He talked about this black and white low budget movie about two blue collar losers who talked endlessly about sex. From that description I wasn't anticipating a masterpiece but I decided to rent it anyway. It was probably the best surprise I have ever had. I was laughing the entire time, so much so that I nearly woke up everyone in my house. For months afterwards my friend and I would endlessly talk about and quote this incredible film. Everyone I have recommended it to has loved it and I can easily see why. I know that some people attack the movie as being vulgar and excessive. The way I see it it is being true to life (I'm sure that when you have 10 hours to kill you'll talk about the average pay of a gizz mopper). In short I absolutely love this film and it gets better and better with every viewing. Rent this film as soon as possible if you haven't already.
B000099T2L|5.0|Lots of gay people like myself love Miss Beyonce.  I think she's fabulous, and I know her man Jay-Z is the luckiest dude alive.  This CD is bangin' with big beats and hot vocals.  Do your thing, Miss Beyonce!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I went to this movie hearing plenty of buzz about how graphic the content was. Over the course of the movie you see just how Aronofsky wants to send his message to the audience. The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest anti-drug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous, but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.<br />As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry, while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year, not even close. I was totally amazed by her.<br />All in all, I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. This is a movie everyone should see, but unfortunately not enough will.
B00029LNHS|2.0|Speechless, thats the only way to describe it. When i first heard the single &quot;Where is the Love&quot; gag reflexes arose and vomiting ensued. Was that a little to harsh? I think not. Their &quot;funky beats&quot; and &quot;genius rhymes&quot; are nothing more than a groups struggling attempt to become celebrated hip pop &quot;artists&quot;. Now, nothing is wrong with wanting making money, but when mainstream heavy hitters are added to to somewhat underground hip hop group's recipe im inclined to ask myself, Where is the love? The love im referring to, is the love of making good music, not vacuous lyrics stratigicly placed beneath poppy, radio friendly beats and Justin Timberlake. Through their first two albums it was the words, innovativly strung together into lines of rhymes, that ran throughout my head daily, not the teribbly misplaced guitar riff from Papa Roach in Anxiety. Im opting not to touch on the other tracks for the simple reason that it might just throw me into a paroxysm of histaria. I own both of their previous albums and belive me, if i could strike this album from their discography i would. This is not quality hip hop, and if you perceive it otherwise i suggest research on your part is necessary, and you might start with &quot;Behind the Front&quot; and &quot;Bridgin the Gap&quot;. Listen to the album if you must, but while you do, ask yourself what exactly it is that your hearing, music or corporate balderdash.
B0000399WI|5.0|At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the \\"only\\" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.<br />But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.<br />It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words \\"His judgment cometh and that right soon.\\" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.<br />Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\\" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.<br />Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.<br />The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the \\"sisters,\\" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the \\"redemption\\" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.<br />All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.
B000001GQC|5.0|Maestro Abbado had done it again. From the bone-chilling bite of the strings (depicting the Russian winter) that open Alexander Nevsky across the Frozen Lake, the LSO under Abbado maintains a dramatic reading of the score. The LSC lacks nothing in the way of Russian idiom and Elena Obraztsova necessarily gives an authentic performance. Her voice is suitably dark. Personally, however, I prefer Anna Reynolds' more haunting lament under Previn...only because Reynolds sounds like a younger woman and to me this is more convincing (and tragic, given the &quot;robbery&quot; of war). Previn also has the added bonus of being recorded in EMI's double-forte Classics series, which also has the complete &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; (with brilliant soloists including a more youthful and vocally secure Irina Arkhipova) and Rachmaninov's &quot;The Bells&quot;. Nonetheless, I give this recording it's due as a great rendition of what I consider to be Prokofiev's most accessible vocal work.<br />The Scythian Suite begins to delve into what I like less about Prokofiev but what, nonetheless, is his more radical and novel side. My comments are therefore curtailed to say this: I have heard far more impenetrable compositions so it's clearly not beyond appreciation (even from someone like me who dislikes dissonance/atonality). Moreover, Abbado's conducting doesn't convey any notion of sheer chaos, so for those who can better appreciate it, this will likely be a good reading (I'm given to believe more than &quot;good&quot; but given my admitted lack of objectivity on the matter, I wouldn't want to indulge my own ignorance).<br />Lieutenant Kije on the other hand is a lovely little work. Anyone who remembers the soundtrack from &quot;The Gladiator&quot; will recognise the inspiration for some of the film's music (together with Wagner's Gotterdammerung incidentally). Again Maestro Abbado conducts with true feeling and warmth, convincingly conveying the drama.<br />This disc forms an worthy part of any introduction to Prokofiev.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Pretty good if you listen to tracks 1 - 14 and just start over.  Songs like Come Together and the Ballad of John and Yoko shouldn't even be on a best of the Beatles album.
6305508550|5.0|If you see one comedy from the late 90s, see this one!  The cast is great, and the story is better.  The only person I know who didn't like this movie just doesn't understand the modern industrial/metroplitan environment.  Driving to work in Silicon Valley REALLY IS THIS BAD, and if your definition of heavy traffic is going 15-20 mph on the freeway, you might not appreciate this film.
0307665488|5.0|This book was given to my sister when she was very young. It became the standard reading book in my family. Try as my mother did we always requested a story from this book. My favourite was \\"Egg in the hole\\". I loved this story and requested it night after night. After a while i knew it off by heart and would tell my parents off if they changes a word. Many years ago we discovered this book in a local bookshop and bought it for friends who had just had a baby - it became a sucess in their family as well. A friend of mine has a 1 year old and i was trying to think of a present for her. The daughter has enough cloths and toys when i thought of giving her a book and remembered how much my family had loved this book. I couldn't find it in any shops in Australia and am very excited to find that it is still in print and available. Although the child is only 1 this book will cover her all the way to school and i hope it becomes as much of a favourite with her as it did with me. Thanks Richard Scarry for some of the best stories ever.
B00000DGUG|1.0|Jagged Little Pill was great, but since then Alanis has just churned out three albums with nothing new to offer, little inspiration, and lyrics that aren't particularly poetic or interesting and overwhelm her music with their sheer bulk.  This album is one of those three.
B000003TAW|5.0|I have been a weezer fan from the start(so like when i was 4)! Personally I think Blue Album is the best because it has great guitar parts and lyrics. I think this is a great cd for about anybody(especially if you like alt. and emo). It is great for road trips or just hanging out. If you get this cd you will love it! tracks 1,5,7,8, and the last are the best. The last track starts off quite and kinda quites down and then takes off and really starts rocking! Any weezer cd is good and you will absolutely love it all!
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi was a wonderful book, with notes of philosophy and theological thought tied into a well crafted story. While it may start with a slightly slower pace than other books in the genre, it is worth the effort. If you liked this, I would also recommend Golf in the Kingdom.
B000060P79|1.0|Though Simple Plan isn't punk, its the fans that call them it and THEY are the dumbasses, anyways, the reason simple plan sucks is because they are talentless, posers, moneygrubbers, pointless, and above all canadian.  Their lead singer whines too much and their music has no purpose or voice besides *insert high pitched whine* \\"oh me oh my, my parents hate me, and god hates me, and I want your cash to help me overcome my pain,\\" well folks don't give 'em a dime, let the little bastards suffer.<br />P.S. BLAME CANADA!
0671027387|4.0|While not the concise and mesmerizing work of his other novel The DVC, this book certainly shows the author's growth from A&amp;D. Dan Brown seems to get better with each subsequent work, I can't wait for his next novel in 2005.
B000001GRZ|5.0|It seems pretty obvious that this recording doesn't need any defending, but the last negative review seems to have garnered some attention, which is why I felt I should try to set the record straight.    The brightness in the sound of the cello (which doesn't seem shrill as far as I can hear on the samples here) is entirely due to the remastering. I own the last release of these suites before the originals remastering, and the tone is one of the most beautiful cello tones imaginable.     The suggestion that this recording is a \\"period\\" performance is unbelievably misleading. This is NOT a reconstructed baroque style performance, whatever that is (one quick comparison of the samples here with some of the horrors you can find on youtube will suffice), but it is a recording that does stand out from many contemporary recordings. Fournier was born in 1906, and his career took off in the thirties. To suggest that any modern performance practice made its way into this performance is absurd. What characterizes Fournier's performance, besides his usual incomparable phrasing and tone, is the subtle use of rubato (which is extensive though discreet: this is by no means a metronomic performance), an incredible feel for how to bring out the different voices in the music in a way that makes everything sound right (to my ears), and a pervading somberness which is unlike any other recording I own. Fournier never forces the music, never paints over it with schmalz or sentimentality, but is always emotionally focused and keenly aware of how he wants every note and phrase to sound. The brilliant music is performed brilliantly, the majestic music is performed majestically, and the sad music is performed with a nobility that engenders the most curious sense of loneliness. You truly feel Fournier is playing for nobody but himself and God. We can be more confident that that was Bach's intention than any other statement about this music.    My recommendation to everybody who comes across this page is to give this recording a chance. Let it sink in. Let your ears be purged of the different versions you have most probably heard (this one seems to be an insider's tip, and so most people end up getting imprinted on Yo Yo Ma), listen with your heart, and you cannot fail to note the intense emotional involvement Fournier brings to these works.     Be warned though, this recording sounds so \\"right\\", so perfect, that they will probably ruin many other versions for you, unless you are also able to detach and give them a chance like you did this recording.
0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises was my first sampling of Hemingway's novel length works. My verdict? Clearly, this is a first novel, but a very good one. The first half of the book is slow and not exactly compelling, and yet by the second half, it really takes off, and I found myself engrossed.<br />Basically, The Sun Also Rises is a portrait of the &quot;lost generation&quot;, those who were so impacted by the war that their lives have no meaning in the traditional sense. They go about a series of meaningless activities that leave them feeling empty and unfulfilled. This premise is fairly existential and dark, and if that isn't your cup of tea, don't bother with the Sun Also Rises. That said, this novel does a great job of characterizing such members of said generation, and the style of the writing is attractively lucid and crisp, yet rich with symbolism. Despite the shaky start, I would reccomend reading this.
0800177975|4.0|You've probably read this film's plot description already, but let me sumerize it briefly just to comment on it: Austin O'Brian is a huge Swartzenagger fan. Arnie's latest films (acording to this film,) are the Jack Slater movies, which (presumably) came out right after Terminator 2. Danny idolizes the character Jack Slater, a fictional L.A. cop, in the same way that so many of us idolized Han Solo. Then one day Danny's personal friend Mick, an elderly theater projectionist, gives him a magic ticket that was given to him by Houdini, just before Danny gets to watch the latest Slater film all by himself, before anyone eles does. (Jack Slater 4). Danny watches as the film introduces the two bad guys, who've kidnapped Slaters cousin Frank. The scene shifts to two nameless cops (who of course are sure-fire dead meat) who come to Frank's house after getting a false call about a drug deal. Slater arrives and wonders why they're here, he goes in and finds Frank tied to a chair, Frank gives Slater one last message before dying, Slater sees a note that turns out to be a count down and gets out just before the house blows up, the two red shirt cops...well, need I even say? A car full of dynomite-weilding bad guys drive up, Slater gets in his car and the chase is on! Then something strange happens. A stick of dynomite comes out of the screen and lands in the theater! It blows up, and Danny finds himself in Slater's car, now a character in the film! <br />I couldn't understand why so many critics and audiences hated this. Naturally I was upset when it bombed in the theatre. It was the most origonal film to come along in quite some time. I mean, really, who hasn't fantasized about being able to actually go into the world of their favorite movie or T.V. show and interact with the characters? Thankfully I see most people on Amazon have given this between four and five stars, so I'm not alone. I loved the action, the humor, (which is basically making fun of typical action films andjust how absurd they are, even the ones that are meant to be taken seriously) and the one-liners. <br />O.K., here's one thing I _didn't_ like: the animated cat. I mean, what the @#&%?! The film works when it spoofs typical action films and ridiculous they are, but not when it goes all the way into the realm of farce and becomes something like Airplane! or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Everything eles was fine, but the cartoon cat...well, when's the last time you saw a conventional action film with living cartoon characters? Really, what were they thinking? <br />Also, there was the bit where (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) we learn about half way through the film that Slater's son Andy was killed. This presumably happened at the end of Jack Slater 3. So Jack Slater 3, it would seem, ends with Slater shooting the Ripper (the bad guy from the last moive), and then the Ripper pulls Andy over with him. Would a typical Hollywood light-hearted action escapest film really have such a dark ending? Well, then again, I guess Lethal Weapon 2 had a simular ending. <br />Anyway, don't listen to anyone who's told you not to see this. This is not another dumb action movie, this is a film pokeing fun at dumb action films (including some of the ones Swartzenagger's made). Check it out for yourself.
B000002OX3|4.0|For a 1966 sophomore album, this is pretty good.  Regardless of each of the bandmembers having to contribute songs to this album, it's still only a sophomore album, and in 1966 the majority of albums, whether they be debut albums, sophomore efforts, or later releases, were nothing more than a couple of hit singles or popular album tracks mixed together with about ten junky throwaways so that an entire album could be filled out and boost the sales of the hit singles.  How can you expect most of any band's early songs to be perfection or as classic as their later songs would be?<br />This is one of those albums I had to give a second listen to for the songs to really sink in and for me to fully appreciate what this album is all about, and I wouldn't recommend it to a new fan.  Still, perhaps because I'm a female fan and most Who freaks are men, I've always viewed these songs as cute and campy instead of embarrassing or something that makes one want to vomit when listening to it.  And you can hear that this is their transition album, going from the bubblegummy sound of the 1966 Pop Art culture that inspired it to more mature things, as evidenced in songs like the title track (how many songs in 1966 were over three minutes in length, to say nothing of nine minutes and ten seconds long?), which was their first mini-opera, as well as the other better tracks like &quot;Boris the Spider,&quot; &quot;Whiskey Man,&quot; and &quot;So Sad About Us.&quot;  It wasn't meant to be a masterpiece like their later albums, it was just meant as a fun slice of 1966 pop paradise.

0380778556|5.0|This wonderful book bored me quite a bit of the way through, but maybe that is because I am a high-school student, and I had to read it.  Without pressure, most books are much more pleasing.  However, looking back, thinking about it, I love this book.  Du Maurier is a  talented author.  She has created a grand environment, the immense Manderley.  She has also made great and intriguing characters: the young, timid narrator, quite often the only one who is left not knowing what is going on (she is never referred to by her first name); the rich, enigmatic Maxim De Winter, the narrator's husband; the loyal servants, including the ever-active Frith and the bumbling Robert; the unforgettable Mrs. Danvers, always seeming to lurk in the shadows, always looking upon Mrs. De Winter with a keen eye of expectancy and detest; the tactless Beatrice; Maxim's agent, Frank Crawley; and of course, the dead, ever-present, haunting Rebecca.  The narrator comes to Manderley, completely new to this lifestyle, and forever falls in the shadow of Rebecca.  She learns of Rebecca's fate, having drowned in the sea after her boat capsized.  She learns everything about the ways of Manderley, and tries to follow these unwritten laws.  Then, a ship crashes somewhere near Manderley, and a diver is sent to survey the damage.  When he comes up, he reports the discovery of Rebecca's ship!  He also reports a body found in the cabin.  Could there have been another passenger onboard?  Did Rebecca even drown at all?  Could she have been murdered?  I won't spoil the big surprises, suffice to say this is where the plot twists and you begin to see the shades of gray.  And of course, the last surprise, which is even foreshadowed on page 3 or 4, is given on the last page for the final eye-opener.
B000092Q8C|1.0|This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not &quot;re-mastered&quot; for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album &quot;Dark SIde Of The Moon&quot; or the Eagles &quot;Hotel California&quot; or Elton John's &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again.

They reminded me in a way of the raptors from Jarassic Park particularly when they are congregating on the launch pad at the end of the film. <BR>Total waste of time. <BR>Perhaps 'Chronicles' will be different?<BR>It definitely looks a bit more polished.
B000092Q8K|1.0|This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not &quot;re-mastered&quot; for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album &quot;Dark SIde Of The Moon&quot; or the Eagles &quot;Hotel California&quot; or Elton John's &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again.
014028009X|2.0|I first read this book a long time ago, around when it came out...I must have been 16 years old. I enjoyed it then. Then the movie came out and I enjoyed that as well. Then, just recently I read Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice to satisfy my curiosity of the classics. As a result, I am now horrifyingly disgusted with Bridget Jones's Diary and with the author, Helen Fielding. Her book is borderline plagerism of Pride and Prejudice. Of course it is not a word for word plagerism but the plot line is exactly the same. Unfortunately, I was only able to find one book review that made mention of this which leads me to believe that Ms. Fielding has gotten away with highway robbery. She even uses the same name for Mr. Prince Charming.<br />In all fairness Ms. Fielding has at least accomplished something. She took a classic, which most people have little interest in reading, and modernized it while adding comic relief. Pride and Prejudice, as a typical Victorian era novel, has little comedy but I must say that Elizabeth, Bridet Jones's counterpart, is much more of a heroine for her time then Bridget is for hers.<br />(...)

B00005JN0A|4.0|i seen this movie on dvd, and wish i had seen it in the theatre,<BR>everything that may go wrong,  does go  wrong and the hilarious mishaps..keeps ya laughin , with adult  humour.
6305161879|2.0|This movie is, in a word, hilarious. I defy anyone to watch it and not have tears streaming down their face from laughter. It's one of those classic, uproariously insane comedies in the Monty Python style, just plain crazy funny. I am an animal lover but even the part where the poodles that get annihilated was hilarious and Michael Palin's reactions to that are beyond funny.  This is one movie that is guaranteed to make you scream with laughter.  I have seen it about a dozen times and it still makes me laugh till I cry.
B000002UAX|5.0|Most bands who attempt to follow up their most critically acclaimed album produce something mediocre at best.  But not the Beatles.  Nothing on this sounds like Sgt. Pepper.  The variety of songs is breathtaking.  Yes, it's obvious they were splintering but it doesn't take away from the fact that they still fed off of each other's creativity and were totally unafraid to take risks.  It just may be the most adventurous musical offering of the 20th century.  It is bold and thought-provoking while at the same time memorable and timeless.  No collection is complete without it.
B000148KK2|1.0|Diana Krall should be credited by helping to end the obnoxious screaming and yelling that became popular with the &quot;love anthems&quot; of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, and Michael Bolton in the 90s. Thank goodness that is going out of style and this new calming and romantic sound is coming into vogue.<br />Unfortunately, this is probably a bit too watered down, introspective and muted to be exciting, passionate or particularly interesting for more than one listening. DIana's &quot;Look of Love&quot;, &quot;Love Scenes&quot; and &quot;Live in Paris&quot; tower above this effort and I hope she gives us more of this type of brilliance again in the future.<br />This CD is imaginative, but seems aimless and confused.

B000002IST|1.0|This is the worse Genesis cd I ever heard. When I bought this it was $2.99 in the cut out bin at Sam Goody(I should have got the hint at the price) There are too many stupid songs to be even considered Genesis. I have Foxtrot and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and I enjoy them much better than this. Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett made Genesis better as this crap proves.
B0002DB52M|5.0|All angles of Von Trier's genius bursting in this movie have been more or less thoroughly explained in the previous posts. I'd just like to add one thing that wasn't much talked about, yet I thing it was the crown jewel of this movie. <br />Yes, the movie is a brilliant study of characters and (dark) human nature, but more importantly it gives viewer a priceless lifetime lesson. It displays a battle between moral purity, youthful idealism and unaware-of intellectual arrogance on one hand and pure-and-simple concept of responsibility on the other. It is in fact this battle that squeezes and twists our stomach throughout the whole movie; it is this opposition which, in all its clarity, finally unveils itself in the final dialogue. Intellectual exchange of argument defines the \\"winner\\". And leaves the viewer contemplating, speechless in awe.<br />A masterpiece that raised the bar of cinematographic creativity on a brand new level.
B000003TAW|5.0|This CD is a classic and I am sure my kids will listen to it when they grow up.  Definitely one of my favorite rock albums of all time. Say It Ain't So and Undone are really great songs.  Get this CD.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|The Fog of War has received rave reviews on Amazon.com, but this review will not add to that long list.  Fog is the word most appropriate for McNamara's discussion of Viet Nam.  After two hours of hit and miss questions and answers, we are left with the conclusion that Viet Nam was a mistake and that McNamara was not responsible for it; that honor goes, according to McNamara, to Lyndon Johnson.<br />McNamara was a statistician/accountant who understood the numbers, but he was not a leader who could translate his knowledge into forceful action.  Instead, it appears as if he supported Lyndon Johnson long after he realized that Viet Nam was going to be a war we could not win.  Additionally, the information that he received about Viet Nam was sometimes innacurate and misleading.  In hindsight he knows that it is unsafe to trust as fact reports given by subordinates.  Without a historical perspective with which to judge the data he received, he arrived at false conclusions which resulted in the deaths of 58,000 Americans and millions of Vietnamese.<br />Not only was McNamara ignorant of history, but he also understood little about ethics.  He concludes that it is morally acceptable to do evil in order to arrive at a greater good.  Machiavelli, in The Prince, would certainly agree with McNamara, but The Prince should not be a handbook for American foreign policy, even though recently it appears that Machiavelli's recommendations are alive and well in American government today. Torturing and abusing Vietnamese and Iraqi prisoners may provide useful information, but few would argue that the evil of torture is justified by what we learn from it.  McNamara would have done well to study Kant's Categorical Imperative.  If we approve of torture, or firebombing in the example given by McNamara, we must recommend that all other nations follow our example, at least according to Kant's Imperative.<br />My guess is that McNamara is a much smarter man than appears to be the case in The Fog of War.  Unfortuntely, the director made McNamara appear to be often confused about the facts which were his stock in trade. He is an old man reminiscing about his life in public service and his memory is conveniently selective and self-serving.<br />Even so, I can recommend this film with the reservations noted for this reason.  No viewer will ever think again that our safety and well being as a nation depend on rationality.  McNamara prided himself on being a logical man of reason and often he was.  That did not stop us, according to his own testimony, of coming an eyeblink away from the apocalyse during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Luck was on our side then.  After watching The Fog of War many viewers will ask: When will our luck run out? This is a question well worth asking.  Hopefully some will answer that we must replace evil intentions and actions toward other countries with moral behavior that stands as an example for the world to follow. This imperative puts us on the right if not always the winning side.e Fog of War.  Unfortuntely, the director made McNamara appear to be often confused about the facts which were his stock in trade.

B00005JLEU|5.0|First of all,don't listen to people who give this masterpiece bad reviews... they probably think disney movies are the only animations worth watching!<BR>This anime is fantastic... Miyazaki is truly a genius. Everything about it blew me away, from the animation and characters to its storyline! The characters have depth, and they show real emotion, and unlike disney movies, there are no annoying sidekicks or crappy songs... in fact, the music is very beautiful and heightens the feel of the movie.Even the dub is pretty good(at least in my opinion), but of course the original japanese with subtitles is best(as always)!<BR>I HIGHLY recommend this one to everyone, anime fan or not!This is definitely worth your money! Don't hesitate!
1573229725|5.0|Any critisisms aimed at Fingersmith have tended to focus on dislike for the twistiness of the plot. I can see that some people would not enjoy this - I know in some other twisty stories I've felt betrayed by the writer - but perhaps because I don't read much in this line, I enjoyed it all immensely.<br />My interest was sustained throughout because certain things remained true throughout - the feelings between Sue and Maud most importantly.<br />Best of all, it is a book which combines the thoughtful slowness of a book of ideas with the exciting plot of a book of action. The story, it is true, might not look out of place on a bad soap opera, but the book is pastiche (Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens) as much as anything else. Suspend your disbelief and you'll have the read of your year.

B0001I55NS|1.0|Book? I don't know about any book, I'm talking about the movie. I can't believe someone even dared to share this crapp with us. <br /> Filled with flaws, TERRIBLE acting, stupid plot (ergo stupid screenplay), cheap unbelievable custome design, cheesy, artless, mindless, insulting, etc. etc. etc. <br /> I wish I'd watch it more recently so I could make a list for you of all the flaws, mistakes, nonsense presented in this rubbish. I can remember an example though:<br> <br> When the archeologists are discovering that new &quot;whatever&quot; underground, the girls says: &quot;Who would destroy such a beautiful piece of art?&quot; (the stone). Then, when they are back in middle age, she is infront of the stone and she must break it so they can escape, then she remembers what she said and answers herself: &quot;Oh, I did it&quot;. (...) What?! The writer might've as well at least watched Back To The Future to get some lessons on time-traveling rules. Nothing you change in the past can be seen in the present before you did it (before the time traveling), because if wouldn't have any sense. In less words, what if she decided NOT to travel in time? Would that stone be broken? Who would've done it? crapp, crapp, crapp. <br /> No opinions here, some movies are still about opinions (In my opinion it's good, in my opinion it's bad), this is plain bad and anyone who thinks the contrary has no idea what he's talking about, and if you son't believe me, check the general rating.
0553382179|5.0|I think I fall somewhere between the reviewers who love or hate this book.  While I give it an unqualified thumbs up, that's not to say I like the style.  I don't.  I am spiky, cynical, irreligious and unsentimental.  I cringe when Marla talks about &quot;blessing the world&quot; and &quot;purple puddles&quot; and her &quot;DH&quot;.  But here's the thing.  This book works.<br />I am not a Stepford wife - I'm a senior executive for a national organisation and I have no family at all, no parents, siblings, partner or children - not even a pet.  Because I have absolutely no time for myself and no priorities apart from work, my house was utter chaos. Thanks to Marla Cilley it is now livable and I am able to have friends over without drowning in shame and am gradually reclaiming my life away from the office.<br />This book contains practical ideas that made me completely rethink my approach to my home.  I am not cleaning out of moral duty or to please someone else, but because I deserve a nice place to live.  The concept that it is better to do something imperfectly than never to start completely changed my thinking.  And permission not to finish - to just do 15 minutes worth and stop - has made a huge difference to my life.<br />And while I don't like the syrupy stuff, I also suspect that someone without that homespun sweetness could not or would not have written this book and offered this help.  So I am just grateful, and Marla can be as religious and as honeyed as she damn well likes, because I truly appreciate what this book has helped me do, and only an idiot throws out a rare gift because the wrapping doesn't suit them - particularly when it is genuinely well meant.<br />And to the patronising cow who can't believe people don't have time to throw out old toothpaste tubes - not everyone has as much free time as you do, and not everyone has the self-esteem necessary to put their own needs first. Clearly you are lucky enough to have plenty of both time and ego. Perhaps you can now invest in some insight to match.<br />Thanks, Marla, for your generosity and common sense.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|&quot;Under MY Skin&quot; is a very good album. There are really only two mistakes in the album that keep it from beign truly great. Avril lack consistency in her lyrics from song to song. Most of the time her lyrics are very powerful and intriguing, but then she seems to run out of creative ideas and produce goofy lyrics. But if you think about it she is speaking to teenagers who are straightfoward and brutally honest these days and so therefore her lyrics work when you think about who she is talking too. Tyhe other problem is that she doesn't have a variety of stories to tell. Being a girl with boy problems is the soul idea for most of tthe songs on this album but her wonderful music and singing help make the ideas and lyrics sound a lot better. They way she delivers each of the songs about relationships is terrific in that she is not complaining about the break up like most pop singers do, she says it was time and she is able to move on. She sings with a determined, confident, agressiveness that is truly a breath of fresh air in todays music industry. The best song on the CD, &quot;forgotten&quot; is wonderful to listen to and sounds very much like a rock song, with some violions towards the end that only make it ten times better. Throughout the CD Avril hints at what I think she really wants to do, which is create some very powerful rock music and in the songs in which she tries it she does it beautifully. This album is very good and as she matures she will only get better. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is definitely worth a look if you are searching for something with a little pop sound with true rock at its core.
0783225849|4.0|I`ve seen this film numerous times and I have always found it a bit cold, made without passion. Sure the shower-scene in particular is a mind-blower, but Hitchcock was much better off in the suspense-genre...  This story simply isn`t interesting enough. It reason may be that it always had a GREAT reputation and everyone who ever saw it knew if by heart and thus destroyed the first viewing of others...  Another factor is that Janet Leigh is much 2 pretty and ladylike for her role. When I saw Anne Heche in the 1998 movie I realised that H E R Marion was indeed a low-life, tramp - sort of - who jumped at the chance of doing something stupid 2 her employer. Janet Leigh`s Marion is never at any moment stupid...  Alas, Anne was much more satisfying, as were Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore.<br />John Gavin and Vera Miles are lifeless - cardboard stereotypes and that leaves us only with Martin Balsam and the great Anthony Perkins. THEY breath life into their characters and are the main reason I like this version. William Macy and Vince Vaughn repeated their roles, but eh..... hehehehe???????? Let there be silence.  In 1983, Perkins reprised his role as Norman Bates to even better effect in the splendid PSYCHO II.
0312955006|5.0|Detective Harry Bosch as a character is totally believable.  Mr. Connelly's knowledge from being a crime reporter show beautifully in his novels.  Very realistic.<br />I wish he had better taste in women.  He like them sexually desirable, but shallow and self-centered.  They always end up dumping him for cold, selfish reasons. They claim to understand the seriousness of his work, and also understand his commitment; but they leave him at his neediest, because only threir (lesser important) needs take precedence.  Disgusting.<br />Hope he figures out he needs to find a real women to build a life with, not just a doll to screw.<br />Overall, an excellent read!!
0790749815|5.0|It seems 2 me that Hitchcock sort of stole many elements from his pre-chaser-films and said: &quot;Good-eeeeevening..... You think you have seen my best efforts, but I must unfortunately dissappoint you.....!&quot;<br />Indeed this is a neurotic and clastraphobic chaser and suspenser - maybe the BEST EVER - thanks 2 the talents of Ernest Lehman, Hitchcock himself, his crew and the entire cast. There are numerous highlights from this film; I prefer NOT 2 single out any of them in favour of others.  This film belongs IN EVERY HOME:-)
B00024BHTC|5.0|well.... in my opinion.. this album rocks big time.... and ill tell you another thing... its the only nightwish album i really liked.... i heard that wishmaster that everyone is talking about... and i didnt like it all... this one got me to like them.... althogh its the only album by nightwish that i can hear.... call me crazy but the other things i heard by them just sounds horrible... only this one got me... I SAY: BUT IT!
B00000I4XR|5.0|I`ve seen this over and over... It simply never outstays its welcome. The thrills are still at potent as in 1975. Yup, they did make sequels and Deep Blue Sea; but it can never be like this....Thanks to the genius of Spielberg, Verna Fields and a GOOD screenplay by Garl Gootlieb and author Peter Bencheley this is both drama, horror and suspense on a high level. JAWS is indeed high art. Scheider, Gary, Duvall, Hamilton and Dreyfuss ALL excell in their roles.
B00005JLXE|4.0|First of all I would like to say that I am a big Marvel comics fan, and I happen to think that Ben Affleck is a good actor. Now with that said....<br />Lets get the mistakes out of the way first. <br />1.There was not enough time spent with the Kingpin, we should have gotten his back story as well. [he was white in the comics, but Mr. Duncan did a good job.<br />2.some moments wee very cheesy. [see foryourself]<br />3.And finally.....that's it.<br />The film was actually better then I thought it would be, I mean after the Hulk came out I thought Marvel was slippin. I now see that I should have seen this in theatures. I can just imagine what it would have looked and sounded like on the big screen. <BR>The effecs in this film were off the hook as well, as well as the camera angles courtesy off Ericson Bore. As far as dialouge goes that could have been a little better at times but over all good, that would be credited to mark steven johnson. I also liked the fact that one of my favorite filmmakers shows up, Kevin Smith. That right there alone makes me want to buy it, oh wait I already did. Casting was on point with this on, putting Ben Affleck as Daredevil was like putting Tobey as peter parker it's a perfect match. And Michael Duncan did a good job as The Kingpin Wilson Fisk. I think the addition of Colin Ferrell as Bullseye was key, he did an excellent job. And Jennifer Garrner did an ok job as Elektra, could have been a little better. Over all I feel that this was a pretty good film, u should check it out.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|.....and the screenplay is wonderful as are the actors. There are no fancy camera-angles or MTV editing of high speed(compared to Moulin Rouge and William Shakespeare`s Romeo+Juliet - classics in their own right), but the camera let the protagonists do their jobs and they do it admirably... Not that every character is of importance; I prefer Connery, Rowlands, Jolie and Philippe; but we all have our favorites... It`s a movie that few people would find dull, boring or just bad.... It`s a low-key masterpiece:-)
B000069HK2|5.0|I wasn't overly excited to listen to this CD, but my friend told me about them and borrowed me the CD.  I think this is how The Used survives, they aren't a big band yet they sell out concerts because of word of mouth.  When a band is this good, they don't even need to promote like other bands...the fans tell 10 people, who tell 10 people, who tell 10 people. <br />It's an awesome CD, worth a listen definately.
B00003CXC7|4.0|I don't think this is Hitch's best film.  It is highly ranked by film rating services, sometimes higher than Vertigo, but I can't agree.  There's something claustrophobic about what is essentially a movie set.  We are stuck in that lofty room with the big glass windows.  Jimmy Stewart peers across a courtyard and observes New Yorkers in their habitat.  When I was in elementary school we used to have projects called diorama's where we would take a shoebox and decorate it like a stage.  Each apartment in Hitch's diorama showcases a mostly silent vignette, the gorgeous dancer and her boyfriends, the lonely-heart middle-age lady, the sex crazed newlyweds, and the guy who kills his wife.      Stewart can watch all the fun, but with a broken leg, he can't leave the apartment to do anything about it.  Hence, the suspense centers on Stewarts inability to maneuver when his girlfriend, fashion gal, Grace Kelly breaks into the killers apartment to find clues.  We see the killer coming down the hall and Jimmy can't warn her from his perch.      Stewart and Kelly are interesting as a couple with opposite interests.  She's high fashion-society chick and he's a rough-it, world-traveling photographer.  These differences never resolve and Stewart appears maybe 15-20 years older than young marriage-scheming Grace.  The film is actually a stage play with stage play lighting and a who-dun-it plot. Great suspense, yes, but not as good as Vertigo by a mile.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I know this film doesn't normally get high reviews, but I have to say this is my FAVORITE movie of all time! There are many things that make this movie awesome, here are some...<br />The first would have to be Renee Zellweger.  I must admit, if it weren't for Zellweger, I would not love the movie as much as I do now.  I still would love it, but she really tops it off.  I personally find her character (Ruby Thewes) in this movie hillarious.  I didn't even know who Renee was, (no offence) until I saw this film, but I know now!  I just wish she were in the movie more than she is! <br />The second thing that made me love Cold Mountain was the setting.  The setting is so beautiful.  If you really like country settings, you will like this one. The whole &quot;farm look&quot; and old town style is great.  It is some what similar to the setting in the movie The Missing.<br />I thought the love story in this movie was creative and nice, but I liked everything else better. If you are looking for a real touching love story you should read a book by Nicholas Sparks, but that is besides the point.<br />Here is some advice, if you are looking for a real war movie, Cold Mountain is probably not the best when it comes to action, it does have action though, but not a lot compared to something like Band of Brothers.  You should give it a try though, because it shows what life was like for the people back home during the Civil War.
6305327084|3.0|Ted Demme has offered us a sweet reunion of small town, New Englander, twenty-somethings.  There is some Big Chill here 1990's style, but for the most part, the guys that stayed home and married or almost married are blue-collar, beer drinking, and chick panting types. High school big man, Matt Dillon is still respected for his womanizing skills. Tim Hutton has a girl back in New York City, but his musical career is getting old and his thirteen-year-old neighbor girl attracts. The relationship between a young man and an adolescent could have been really creepy, but there's some deft writing and directing, so we enjoy this impossibility for a few hours. Uma Thurman vamps as the perfect chick.  Each of the single guys gives her a rush, but she's just out of reach as any apparition. My wife really liked this one. Maybe there's more appeal to chicks in this flick because Rosie O'Donnell in a minor part sure makes a mockery of men and their desires.
B00024BHTC|1.0|Nightwish can't write, can't sing, sound pathetic and are total and utter crap.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I rented this film, I watched the Director's cut. Later on, I saw the Theatrical cut, and honestly, I liked the former more. The ending was much more heartfelt and ironic.<br />But the other day, I got onto RottenTomatoes.com and looked it up. To my surprise, the critics agreed that this film was rotten. I felt that Ashton did a splendid job embracing a more serious role. Moreover, the story was completely unpredictable and non-cliche. I was overwhelmed with the movie, and I thought it was awesome.<br />Although both cuts are good, I have to recommend the Director's cut.
B00024BHTC|2.0|Some of the reviews on this record are strange because this album is no way a 5 star album.  In saying that it isn't a 1 star either.  2 Stars is the best I can give this.  There have been a few reviews saying that nightwish are unoriginal and I agree with these reviews.  It is impossible to put out much music nowadays without it being associated with something thats been done before.  Nightwish are no exception.  There music was done 20 years ago.  Some reviews have attacked the singer.  This isn't the best I've heard, but not the worst either, so again 2 stars.  If you are into neo-classical opera type rock then you will probably like this.  But no way is this as gooda album as some people are making out here, and to be frank I found a few tracks on this album annoying to listen to.  Infact some of the tracks with their symphonic overtures, sounded plainly stupid.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|The film, although not filled with exciting plot twists, is rather good. Instead of focusing on plot, the film focuses more on character development, as well as the development of a relationship. I believe that we all can relate to situations in which we become friends with someone, yet never keep in touch after this seemingly wonderful time has passed. The characters are real, and heartfelt, and although, like I said, it wasn't incredibly exciting, it does contemplate the mechanics of relationships in a way I never thought possible.
1592400876|5.0|I'm a fellow grammar Nazi and have received about a dozen copies of this book from well-meaning friends who think I haven't seen it already. Yes, it's great, but there is a huge error in it, one staring Truss in the face (which she should now be hiding in shame). In the subtitle \\"The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation,\\" there should be a hyphen between \\"zero\\" and \\"tolerance.\\" The hyphen's main purpose in life is to join multiple physical words into a single logical/virtual word. \\"Zero-tolerance\\" is an adjective meaning \\"admitting no tolerance,\\" or maybe \\"not at all tolerant\\"; the pair of words \\"zero tolerance\\" is a phrase that means \\"tolerance of zeroes.\\" Sheesh.
B00005S6K8|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  It takes an already-good plot and updates it -- an \\"Ever After\\" for our classic Cinderella story.  The new Sabrina is more self-sufficient, worldly, and her relationship with Linus is much more mature than the variety of relationships portrayed in any movies from Hollywood's Golden Era.  It's not that the first Sabrina isn't a wonderful classic, but while that one was classic for its fairy-tale quality, and cute scenes that could never be truly be duplicated, this one meets the demands of an audience who today, wants proof that these are actually two people in love.  With Ormond's character, we, the audience, understand and participate in her transition from teenage infatuation to mature love.  There are no petty emotional mind-games here, as are so common in Bogart-era romantic comedies.<br /><br />In addition, the actors themselves add considerably to the movie's success.  Kinnear's David matures as well, from playboy to partner, and it is easy to see that his relationship with his brother has played no small part in the formation of his playboy image.  Additionally, many of his lines are priceless.  Ormond delivers a few ringers as well, including my favorite, when she refers to Linus as \\"the only living heart donor.\\"<br /><br />And all this is without speaking of the music.  The soundtrack is excellent.  The score is classy for its infusion of jazz, yet made passionate by John Williams' unmistakable orchestration.  Sting also contributes a haunting ballad.  It all fits beautifully into the movie.<br /><br />I cry every time I watch this version of Sabrina, and I'm not the crying type.  I highly recommend it -- not as a remake, but on its own merit.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|During WWII, millions of Jews whose only crime in the eyes of some where their being<br />Jewish.  Thousands to over millions were sent into concentration camps where few<br />survived and many were murdered, even the innocent of innocent, the children.  Those<br />Jews who managed to escape did so by fleeing to hopeful safe harbors in other countries,<br />or, they passed.  Far from passing to gain material wealth, power, and a share in the<br />decadence of the predominant group, these Jews  simply sought to survive and see<br />another day.  One cannot help but admire those who spent the rest of their lives,<br />whenever possible, challenging racism and bigotry and injustice.<br />The titled character in the HUMAN STAIN is far from being admirable and sympathetic.<br />Coleman Silk is a black man who chooses to pass as white to enjoy the privileges of<br />being white.  He doesn't care to fight the injustices that deny his people their humanity,<br />but instead chooses to cater and bow down in honor and the keeping of such injustice<br />against his own people.  Ironically, at the time he passes, those Jews who where unable to<br />pass were being killed, entire families.  Even more ironical, Silk chooses to pass as<br />Jewish.  He turns his back on his family, even after his mother in the movie pleads with<br />him in what has to be the best emotionally intense moment in the movie.  Seemingly<br />without much conscious to morals, Silk starts his life new as a white man without anyone<br />ever suspecting him as being anything other than this.  He marries a white woman, begins<br />a career as a college professor, lives the American dream of freedom without roadblocks.<br />Life is pretty good until his wife dies and  two black students accuse him of using a racial<br />slur against them which is accidental and unintentional, but Silk so long denying his<br />heritage does not realize the power and mistake of the word he has used.  At this point,<br />his mask begins to fall off and his past comes back to haunt him and it is not forgiving.<br />The main problem with this film is the way the story is told.  The makers would have<br />done better to tell the story from the perspective of the young Silk instead of the old Silk<br />who is played by Anthony Hopkins.  Moreover, the character played by Nicole Kidman,<br />who Silk begins a May/December relationship with in the midst of the Clinton sex<br />scandel with a young intern, seems to pollute the storyline and burden it down.  Kidman<br />plays her part well, as the entire cast is excellent, but her character should have been<br />exercised from the story on the big screen all together.  It is the young Coleman Silk and<br />his family who are the really interesting characters deserved more time on screen instead<br />of only being seen in flashback scenes.<br />The press for this movie was a lesson in the racial divide that is growing in the U.S.  The<br />press took more of an interest in seeing how quick the guy who played young Silk,<br />Wentworth Miller,  would distance himself from being black than they did in the moral<br />questions raised in the movie or book of the same name by a white man.  Sadly, they may<br />have gotten what they wanted.  I hope that I am wrong.  I would take great pride in being<br />wrong!!!!!  and offer an apology for the misunderstanding of Miller.  Rather than<br />understanding the diversity of the black American community, that is, that black<br />Americans are a multi-cultural people whose blood roots extend not just in Africa but<br />also Europe and even Asia and all those places in between, regardless of the complexion<br />of skin or of the skin or race of one or both parents--the cause of the huge color spectra<br />among black Americans and blacks from North America to South America--, and, that<br />black Americans are a people proud of their ancestry in all its diversity regardless of what<br />only a handful of extremely bigoted afro-centralist don't want admitted and many white<br />Americans refuse to take time to learn and  understand, the press has  played to its own<br />blind and ignorant liberal bias that divides blacks Americans into dangerous social stratas<br />of ethnicities.  For his part, Miller, who doesn't deny his heritage like he has done in<br />playing  earlier roles in his career until the HUMAN STAIN,  has shown a proclivity not<br />to correct his interviewers and has legitimized their prejudices that the one drop rule of<br />blood applies  to all but a few of black Americans who have one non black American<br />parent, political correctness at its most perverse and dangerous.  Miller doesn't<br />understand or doesn't want to understand that he is legitimizing racist fallacies.<br />To those who choose to watch the movie, or even, read the book, keep in mind that the<br />story is written from the view point of those or one person  not in the know to all the<br />nuances, diversity, complexity, pride, heartache and tragedy, joy, sometimes<br />embarrassment, anger, struggle, bloodlines, and stories to the black American community<br />no matter how sympathetic and understanding they claim to be.refuse to take time to learn and  understand, the press has  played to its own<BR>blind and ignorant liberal bias that divides blacks Americans into dangerous social stratas<BR>of ethnicities.

B00006J3WH|5.0|The season six &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; episode that inspired this soundtrack is not to be missed--Buffy and the Scooby Gang sing and dance their way through Sunnydale, making for very compelling viewing. I was skeptical about the success of a &quot;musical&quot; episode, but Joss Whedon's ability to enrich various plotlines through music is impressive. Standout numbers include Anya's &quot;Bunnies&quot; rant in &quot;I've Got A Theory,&quot; Spike's &quot;Rest in Peace,&quot; and the poignant &quot;Where Do We Go From Here.&quot; If you loved the episode, I doubt you'll be disappointed with the soundtrack.

B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain is a very good movie.  The only problems I have with the movie is it takes so long to get into (but once you do it's so worth it) and the fact that they barely met and were already madley in love! <br />As a previous reviewer mentioned there is a very explicit love scene.  It is my opinion that the love scene is so very important to the movie.  You almost feel the love between the two.  The movie would not have made such an impact on me without this scene.

0312319517|1.0|Very disappointing novel that has nothing to do with Forsyth's previous work. The intricate plots of Dogs of War and Day of the Jackal give me the impression that this story was not written by the man himself. A messy story from Bosnia via the Middle-East to South America? Come on, next to Bin Laden Forsyth introduces South African bullies, private armies, CIA black ops, Vietnam vets and every other cliche in modern suspense. Please pick up any other Forsyth.
B0000959N0|4.0|Affleck has never been my favorite actor but his Matt Murdock made this movie for me. I can relate to his desire to see justice done and to stand up for the little guy. I loved it that he only defends clients that he believes are innocent even if they can't pay him. I also liked the fact that he grappled with his own morality and battled to keep his desire for revenge from getting in the way of his desire for justice. The Kingpin is Daredevil's enemy and like Daredevil he comes from a violent past. It's Daredevil's struggle to remain on the side of justice that makes him different from the Kingpin. They are as different as they are the same. Will there be a Daredevil sequel? Daredevil was a money maker and the plan all along was to get Elektra off the ground next and that's what's still being planned.  We'll have to stay tuned to see exactly what's next for Daredevil at the movies. Meanwhile we have the Daredevil DVD. It's too bad so many people insist on wanting Daredevil to be another Spiderman but I like Daredevil for he is. With or without the mask Matt Murdock is a guy with his heart in the right place who struggles with his demons and tries to do what's right. <BR>I like that.
B000002I25|5.0|Let me tell you how great this album is. I found every song so great, I grew up thinking this was a greatest hits album. Until I realized I was an idiot...and wrong, I always never considered this one of their greatest albums because I never thought it was a regular album. That being said, you can already understand the power this has. Either that or how much of an idiot I am.<br />The Doors is my all time favorite band. Morrison, Manzarek, Densmore, and Krieger...the finest in each of their professions. From Morrison's swagger and unintelligible poetry at times, to Manzarek's blues and soul organ, then forth to Densmore's eccentric jazz drumming, and finishing up with the inane flamenco aspects of Krieger's finger picking guitar work...The Doors in retrospect, own. Their debut is such a powerhouse and makes you scream, explode, and reach for the air, that you really just can't get enough of it.<br />The singles, the hits, and the golden ones are obvious. Who in their right mind HASN'T heard 'Break on Through' or 'Light My Fire'? Or even 'Whiskey Bar'? It's apparent that this album has highlights. But, look further and you can see just where the Doors progressed. From the opening rawhide thunder opener, 'Break on Through' we slowly diminish into this psychological warp that is, 'The End.' Surprisingly, that's exactly where the Doors left off and began with their follow up, 'Strange Days.'<br />While this is their debut, it is almost a greatest hits album. It culminates everything the damn Doors are. It has psychological, psychedelic rock with that jazz, that blues, and even that thrill. You watch sneak previews at the theaters today and it's not too different than this. Their self titled debut is a demo to what was to come, the ride they were to take us on.<br />While it's certainly not their best, I rate all of their albums five stars, even the distant 'Soft Parade.' Why? Simply, The Doors were one of those bands that you rarely ever see. Much like 'The Beatles' or 'Led Zeppelin', they were perfect. They matured and they thrived and they never looked back...they just increased upon. It's obvious 'LA Woman', their last album, had hints of this self titled debut, but even then...that was different too.<br />Forget all that, this isn't about the history of the Doors, but this album almost depicts that. If you want to know what the experience of the Doors is like, I more than highly recommend this to you. You can start from here and keep on going, never look back...that's what they did. This is easily one of the most influential and greater albums from the past. You will not be disappointed. Buy this, then buy Strange Days!<br />That...or rent 'The Doors.'or 'Led Zeppelin', they were perfect. They matured and they thrived and they never looked back...they just increased upon.

B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona Apple was signed to a major label in 1995 on the strenght of a demo tape of a few songs. She was 18, and a major label signing an unknown teenager was possible only because we now know (in retrospect) that 1995-96 were the heydays of the \\"alternative music\\" scene, and anything was possible.<br /><br />\\"Tidal\\" (10 tracks, 51 min.), released almost 8 years to the day, was auspicious in many respects. The confessional writing style, the jazzy-smokey pop (don't even think Norah Jones, but more a jazzier Tori Amos or Aimee Mann), it all struck a cord. And a few killer songs helped tremendously of course. \\"Shadowboxer\\" became a breakout hit, and justifiably so, it still sounds good today, 8 years later. Other oustanding tracks include the opener \\"Sleep to Dream\\", \\"The First Taste\\" (with great lyrics like \\"Darling Just Start the Chase/I'll Let You Win/But You Must Make the Endeavour\\"), and \\"Pale September\\", featuring the vibraphone which is used throughout the album, very effectively. However, the very best of them all \\"Never Is A Promise\\", a haunting ballad.<br /><br />Since \\"Tidal\\", Fiona has released only one other album (1999's oustanding \\"When The Pawn\\"), but supposedly we will finally see a new album later this year. Meanwhile, \\"Tidal\\" is aging quite nicely. Strongly recommended!<br /><br />*UPDATE* (June, 2012) Just saw Fiona on her current tour in support of \\"The Idler Wheel\\", what an electric performance. I have seen her on a number of occasions, including on the original \\"Tidal\\" tour here in Cincinnati. The current tour brings songs from all 4 studio albums pretty evenly, including 4 tracks from Tidal: Dream to Sleep, Shadowboxer, Carrion, and of course Criminal. If you can see her on this tour, absolutely do not miss it!
B000003TAR|5.0|When 'Nevermind' hit the charts in 1991, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was already the anthem to a lost generation as many would say. The greatest thing about 'Nevermind' was that it brought the band onto the main stage and allowed the inevitable, 'In Utero.'<br />Like Hollywood sequels, the good are rare. In this case, 'In Utero' takes good and throws it out of the ballpark. It's everything the first album was and wasn't, all at the same time. In this case, you have the action figure packed riffs that hook you and entice each listener to each song. Don't tell me 'Heart Shaped Box' doesn't send volts down your spine! Needless to say, lyrically, the album sheds away from changing youth, to just talking about it. There are several kep points in the album, that always amaze me.<br />'Serve the Servants', arguably one of their greatests songs, makes a joke upon themselves and the culture following. It's extraordinary to find one song that culminates everything the band is. From the raw sound, to the campy yet intricate lyrics of Cobain, and to the mood, we come to view Nirvana more than a band, but as a social phenomenon.<br />'All Apologies' and 'Pennyroyal Tea', both quiet and timid in nature, but far from peaceful. It's this confusing, albeit tricky choice of songwriting that has everyone go, 'Oh...' and then finally realize the meaning leaving them with, 'Oh!' Listen to the tracks and then really listen to them! See the images you see and the ones meant to be seen. It's a trip.<br />'Rape Me' and 'Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle' are a darker 'Date Rape' and a historic horror fest, respectively. On one hand we see the terrors we read about and on the other, we see a story we never really knew. It's bold and it's sound takes on different dimensions, something bands use a lot today. The low verse, heavy distortion choruses...very formulaic, and surprisingly, very original then.<br />The album surprises me to this day, even after ten years or so have passed. Besides maybe 'Unplugged', this is the real way to see Nirvana as honest as they were meant to be. If you catch even a glimpse of it, then you're already hooked. If you even like rock, art, or anything that makes you...um...think, then buy this. I shouldn't even be suggesting this, this is an imperative buy.<br />It's so perfect, but it's not...and that's what makes it what it is.sed.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple rose to notoriaty with her 1996 debut album \\"Tidal\\" (released when she was all of 19 years old), and then took 3 1/2 years to release her second album in November, 1999. It was well worth the wait, and the album sounds as good now as it then, if not better.<br /><br />\\"When the Pawn\\" (10 tracks, 42 min.) delivers on the promise of \\"Tidal\\" and then some! From the excellent opener \\"On the Pound\\", Fiona delivers one standout track after another, and shows how much her songwriting has matured from \\"Tidal\\". Although her music is very different from Tori Amos, spiritually they are both on the same page. I can't help but notice, though, that Matt Chamberlain, drummer and side-kick for Tori's albums, drums on most tracks here too. If one has to pick out standout tracks in the album (there are no weak tracks truly), I will pick the angry \\"Limp\\", the enthralling \\"Fast As You Can\\", and the pensive \\"The Way Things Are\\".<br /><br />One thing that stands out is how much Fiona's lyrics have improved from her debut album. This despite the ridiculous album's full title (which is a 90 word poet). It's been more than 4 years since \\"When the Pawn\\" was released, but supposedly a new album is in the works for later this year. \\"When the Pawn\\" was released in late 99 and I called it one of the best of 2000 (see my annual \\"best of\\" lists) simply because I felt its impact wasn't felt until then. It still resonates with me now as it did then. Just magnificent!<br /><br />*UPDATE* (July 2012) Just saw Fiona on her current tour, and she plays about half of this album (Fast As You Can; Get Gone; I Know; On The Bound; Paper Bag). It is clear now that this is Fiona's best album, period. A timeless masterpiece, period. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! And if you can catch her on her current tour, do not miss that!
1592400876|5.0|Lynne Truss has done an excellent job educating (and entertaining) the public on punctuation. At least, she's done a great job educating and entertaining me.<br />I began this book with the outlook that I'd finally read a non-fiction book that stood for the truth, and was neither ashamed about it nor self-flattering. This is exactly what I received from Miss Truss' (or perhaps Truss's) Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves. (Note the George Bernard Shaw style in the writing of the title.)<br />Let's begin with organization (or perhaps organisation). Truss has done an excellent job organizing this book. Each section deals with a certain portion of punctuation, and sticks to that section (unlike some books such as Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus). When rules apply to the punctuation, Truss lists these rules in a very organized manner and elaborates where extra information is needed. Beginning with an Introduction, then the main sections of punctuation,[&lt;- Notice this Oxford Comma] and following a Concluding section. During all portions of the book she acknowledges the necessary information as well as making references to examples that help to explain certain things or perhaps to offer an opposition.<br />Writing. Truss' writing is un-matched. She has a simple technique that includes intelligence and advanced ideas. Never does she attempt to step outside her boundaries and write (...let's say: showy) in a showy way. She is quite reserved, but expresses herself and the truth when necessary.<br />Overall position. Truss stands by herself. She is not afraid to correct those who are incorrect; she is not ashamed to admit her inconsistencies and mistakes. Often non-fiction books take a strong stance and things and don't budge. These stands are commonly outrageous and obviously incorrect in some people's eyes. Truss makes subtle stands for what she believes in, and she believes in the truth.<br />This is an excellent, quick read. A recommended weekend reader.
B000002N3J|4.0|This is a collection of Madonna's best ballads. There are 10 of her ballad hits, and some new tracks. I think that her version of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Want You\\" is the best cover song she's ever done. The video clip is good too, very rarely seen but it's beautiful. She also updates \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\", which was originally from her 1984 album LIKE A VIRGIN. The new version is nice I guess. The other new song is a David Foster ballad, the acoustic \\"One More Chance\\", which shows off her vocals a little more. This album obviously was released to try to recoup some of her fans she lost over the EROTICA and Sex Book projects, perhaps reminding people why they loved Madonna. \\"You'll See\\" is an excellent ballad, another new song. Then you have other ballads like \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\", \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Something To Remember\\" and more. Overall a nice collection of ballads from Madonna.

B00008CLOA|5.0|i find it disgusting and pathetic that any human being can give a negative review about this album or any album that this band has put out. i am absolutely speechless that people can write bad reviews about something they know nothing about. they are one of if not the most influencial bands in history. when this album was released in 1973 nothing even compared to its magnificence and beauty, in my opinion nothing compares to it even today. i being 16 years old am in complete awe when i listen to this album. anyone who appreciates rock music should be ashamed of themselves if they havent heard this album.
0783241399|5.0|Well, it should've gone to Washington for his breathtaking performance in this biopic from 2000. Washington captures the very essence of the different modes of &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, a man wrongly incarcerated for a crime that he didn't commit. Washington superbly displays the various sides of this most complex man: anger, defiance, reflection, intelligence, humility, and perseverance. As others have hypothesized, Denzel's win for &quot;Training Day&quot; was a reward for Academy oversights for earlier tremendous performances...and his work in &quot;The Hurricane&quot; ranks as one of his best.<br />Besides the work of Washington, the film benefits from marvelous turns from co-star Vicellous Reon Shannon as a young man enamored of the boxer and determined to right the wrong that has befallen Carter. The young man possesses the right amount of &quot;wide-eyed innocence&quot; as he confronts a man that he discovers in a long-forgotten autobiography. Who cannot be moved when man and boy share a tender moment by touching through the bars of the convict's cell???<br />This kid deserved a supporting acting nod, if nothing less.<br />And a film that sports such stellar character performers as Rod Steiger, Debbi Morgan, Dan Hedaya, Harris Yulen, Clancy Brown, and David Paymer is a cut above the others. Liv Shrieber, Deborah Unger, and John Hannah are wonderful as Canadians that assist Shannon's &quot;Lesra&quot; as the lad works to free his friend.<br />While there are a few slow moments, the overall film is worth viewing...and owning.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|The civil war was a period of unimagined brutality and suffering. This movie captures the horror and chaos of that time while also offering a glimpse of renewal and hope. Kidman is awesome. So is Zellweger. If you ever wondered what Letterman was carping about with &quot;if you need me, here I am...&quot;, see this movie. I don't know if there's a joke to get, but at least you'll get the reference.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I saw the movie in theatres and loved it. I couldnt wait until the DVD came out. I came home, popped it into my DVD player and had just watched and listened throught the whole movie. I love this movie, its just so moving to me. The Directors Cut is alot better I believe. Im a guy and I almost cried at the end. It was just a fitting end, and some of my friends didn't understand the movie cuz they keep on yappin their mouths during the movie and not watching every little detail. I love Ashton Kutcher in That 70's Show and Dude,Wheres My Car, but this was a totally different kind of movie for him. And he succeeded undoubtly. He showed he could really act, and was just amazing. Like I said, the ending is very sad, if anyone hasnt seen this movie, or the Directors Cut, you should buy this DVD rite away. Its WELL worth the money.
1592400876|4.0|I like Lynne Truss. I'd love to have a long lunch with her. Not because she's a grammar know-it-all but because she's intelligent and funny at the same time. This is apparent in her book &quot;Eats, Shoots and Leaves.&quot; As an editor, I've shared many of the same emotions as Truss concerning dropped commas, unnecessary apostrophes and mangled colons. She's a lady after my own heart. I gleaned a lot of useful history behind the rules and laughed heartily while doing it. Who knew there was so much to the apostrophe?<br />I'm also thankful that Truss is mindful of different styles (AP being the one I adhere to) and the ways of we wacky Americans. She knows that grammar itself continues to change over the centuries. <br />Truss is a beacon of hope for those who despair that any semblance of structure is fast evaporating from all written discourse. Just read the message boards on any Web site (full of &quot;i luv ths book!&quot; and the like) and you'll understand what I mean.
B0001BKAEE|4.0|I would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't. It like The Matrix Reloaded wasn't quite as good as the original, but still is a brilliantly written and important piece of sci-fi literature. Although it starts out directly where Reloaded leaves off, the situation is completely understandable and not confusing to a non-Matrix person. Like the others, its soundtrack of classical music with a blend of rock gives a nice feel.<br />Mind-boggling conversations between characters sieze to get old and Keanu Reaves gives his best preformance in the trilogy. It ends strangely, with Buddhist-Christian philosophies that balnket the sad ending with a happy, touching feel.<br />My only problem with this film is that the battle scenes are to elongated, and after a while become tedious, and just blurres of flashing light and loud noises.<br />Overall, I thought this was a great ending chapter to a science-fiction masterpiece.
B000053VAF|2.0|As a sweet bite of blaspemy this Kevin Smith stinker may do fine, supported by a star-studded cast and a crunchily inventive premise to sink our collective teeth into the heart of Catholicism.<br />But it is amusing to see a horde of reviewers call this clever and thoughtful. Sorry folks, the film's troop of eccentric characters do very little to bail it out of its convoluted ramble about theology.<br />When it comes to intellectual muck-raking, the film with its doozy &quot;loophole&quot; simply drowns under the weight of diminishing returns. Religion is not an intellectual exercise, it's role is to fulfill spiritual, psychological and emotional needs in our lives. A person needs his world to make some sense to them, and religion can comfort with answers that science can not yet provide.<br />If on the other hand you're game for some tongue-in-cheek degenerative humor (for example, giant monsters of bubbling human excrement) sure, this may be right up your alley. Just make sure you have plenty of time as the circus goes on for a while.
B000009EAD|4.0|Somthing Wicked This way comes is a cd that I have been looking forward to purchasing for awhile now. I already owned Horror Show, the Dark Saga, and Tribute to the Gods. I love thes cd's and almost everything on them.There style is so unique and fun espeacially when they give time for people to hear the amazing vocals of Matt Bartlow. I felt that in this album he did not show his very best work. He seemed to ruch out his lyrics on a lot of the album and somtimes in verged on the sound of a lot of talentless &quot;singers&quot; out there that just shout or growl out an entire album.<br />Don't get me wrong, this album had a lot of strong points and I would defiently reccomend this album to any Iced Earth Fan because even with a few bad tracks this cd still kicks but. This album seems to have a little but of a religious theme, with a lot of songs about angels, jesus, corrupt priests and of course the anti-christ.<br />One of the best things on this album is the fourth song. THis song is for all the people that are big fans of the songs like Ghost of Freedom, and A question of Heave.It is about a guy who lost his freind but now he feels his angel guiding him through hard times. It is very good, and can be intense at some moments, which is somthing I love when listening to music. <br />So agian I Definitly reccomend this cd, just make sure that you buy Dark Saga and Horor Show First.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Cold, calculating, but ultimately callow Upper Middle Class pop jazz from an Ice Queen who sings with all the soul of a doorstop. If this is indeed Ravi Shankar's daughter, she inherited not one iota of her father's passion and artistry. Phony through and through.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is a lot more than a so-called bloodfest and being equal to Finding Nemo.  For those that think Finding Nemo has more religious value there is no hope for them.  The Passion of Christ will make everyone who sees it realize what Jesus Christ did for us as sinners.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Speechless is the only way to describe my first viewing.  I made a comment later that evening that it was odd there was no soundtrack.  It seemed there should be beautiful music.  Afterwards, I saw the soundtrack and bought it. It is beautiful.  When I went back the second time to see the film, there it was...perfect and very moving.  I was so engulfed in the film and the emotion, I did not even realize the music was there.  I bought the soundtrack.  I cry listening to it.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First i would like to say that the jump from iowa to the subliminal verse are huge and that is in a positive way, they have really become better musicians.<br />1:prelude 3.0 3/5:Kinda like a long intro, bit boring, but ok<BR>2:the blister excists 5/5:So f#¤!%&amp;g good, reminds me the old slipknot<BR>3:three nill  4/5:kinda like the blister excists, and it´s very good<BR>4:Duality 5/5:The best hard song on the cd<BR>5:opium of the people 5/5:love the guitar work in this one<BR>6:circle 4/5:the first suprise on the cd with accoustic guitars, very good, but annoying background noice<BR>7:Welcome 2/5:my least favourite track on the cd, very messy<BR>8:vermillion 4/5:very good, but nothing special<BR>9:pulse of the maggots 4/5:reminds of duality just not as good<BR>10:before i forget 5/5:as good as duality, reminds of Metallica<BR>11:vermillion pt.2 5/5:beatiful song, corey really shows he can sing<BR>12:the nameless 1/5:a terrible song, the only reason im not giving it 0/5 is the chorus<BR>13:the virus of life 2/5:a boring song<BR>14:danger-keep away 5/5:the best slow song on the cd, very beatiful
B0001LJC2K|5.0|A convoluted metaphor for you:<br />Radiohead = father<BR>Incubus = mother<br />It's as if Radiohead and Incubus, horrified at the thought of not having a child, adopted Dexter Freebish.  Years later, the doting couple finally had their first-born, Muse.  Not being the favorite, Freebish tinkered with Muse's mind a bit while the first-born took musical inspiration from its mother and father.  The result: Muse's skillfully crafted and complex (&quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot;) sound that operates, at times, on subtle simple elegance (&quot;Time Is Running Out&quot; and &quot;Ruled By Secrecy&quot;).  The lyrics fall in between Incubus' blatantly explicit stories and Radiohead's befuddling, cycphered words and work wonderfully and often keep the record aloft.  They obviously know how to write a catchy hook while keeping it meaningful.  This is a must-own record of wonderfully evocative rock for Radiohead fans and/or those who don't enjoy the bizarre subtleties of Radiohead.
B00000IP2L|5.0|Zakk Wylde is a great songwriter, with a very broad range.  First he gives us Pride &amp; Glory, demonstrating clear mastery of Southern Rock and Country styles.  Then he follows with Book of Shadows, a perfect singer songwriter outing from start to finish.  Sonic Brew proves that Zakk is also the master of Hard Rock and Grunge.  I mean, Alice in Chains were a good group, but their best effort (Dirt) is totally spanked by this inspired, bone crunching record.  Every tune is a masterpiece, no joke.  How did he do it?<br />The only drawback of this fine recording is a slightly overdriven sound - there's a little distortion on everything - even the drums.  I grew to enjoy this facet of Sonic Brew, but it may be disconcerting to people expecting that slick hard rock polish.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It took her a while but she came back in full force.  All the tracks are great and they show that she really grew up.  Through her songs, you understand that she grew into a woman who's comfortable in her skin, sexuality, and just her place in the world.  You hear her tears in \\"I'm Okay\\", singing about her abusive father and you feel her love for herself in \\"Beautiful\\" a song that encourages self love and determination in believing in all that you are.  Every woman should own this album.  You won't be wasting your time.  She kicks Britney's ass with this.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King's On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, is probably the best advice book you're goin to get.<BR>It has three parts:<BR>     (1)An account on his younger life, and why he thinks he came to be the type of writer she is today.<BR>     (2)The second part is an absolutely fantastic account on writing. He runs you through Plot Development, Character development, different types of plot eg: Story/Situation, advice on Literary Agents, submitting short-stories to magazines etc etc etc...<BR>     (3)And the last 60 pages or so is an account on the horrifying accident he had in 1999 in Maine. He walks through it in detail.<br />As an aspiring writer myself, I found this book classic. When I think back to before, when I didnt read it - and was writing myself - If found that I really needed it. <br />So, for anyone who wants to know the low-down on becoming a successful writer, buy the book; for anyone who is a fan this is a must, you will read exciteing stories about his childhood and later life, and read the explicit chapter on his horrible accident.<BR>   King, at his best. :-)(-:
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is THE BEST album from THE BEST BAND EVER!!!  Wildest Dream is pretty good, No More Lies is freaking cool (check out their video for it-it's bad!) Dance of Death is probably the best song of all time, Paschendale is amazingly cool, and so is Face in the Sand.  The other songs are really cool too.  Seriously, this is the best CD I have ever listened to.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|Perhaps at 34 I am too young to 'get' this movie. I was hoping for a great romantic comedy, but found this one fell flat. Not even in the same universe as As Good as It Gets. After Jack Nicholson's character is stranded at Diane Keaton's house, I just lost interest. I didn't think he was anyone's dream man, and their love scene was frankly more than a little embarrassing. And the ending! Let's just say I find it very hard to believe a 60-something leopard would change his spots.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is like a dream come true!!<BR>I cannot wait for the second season to come out!!
B00024BHTC|2.0|Why so many reviews?  a rave review seems to be followed by a crap one over and over again.  Everyone to their own, but there is definately some massive differences of opinion on this album. To some it is simply fantastic or trash.  I'll go down the middle, It isn't as good as some people are making out.
B00005R62K|5.0|Stained Class is one of Judas Priest's best CD's.  It contains Exciter - probably the best speed metal song out at that time. Saints In Hell - Black Sabbath worship done perfectly.  Stained Class - the best misanthropic song ever, in my opinion.  Heroes End - a tribute to fallen legends like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin that asks &quot;Why do you have to die to be a hero.&quot;  Beyond the Realms Of Death - few can do ballads like Priest and this is one of thier best, also has one of Glenn Tipton's best guitar solos ever.  Invader - awesome guitar sound effects at the start by KK Downing.  Savage - makes a great case for modern man being savages.  White Heat Red Hot - just a great classic metal tune.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|From Zellweger's overhyped performance to Kidman's not-believable portrayal of a love-sick, starving victim of the Civil War, here is a film that starts slow and quickly downshifts. How DOES one manage to make a Civil War \\"epic\\" with almost no black people in it? Oh, wait, this is supposed to be an \\"epic love story.\\" Yep, a love story wherein the hero and heroine have exchanged about a dozen sentences each, but manage to never never never stop thinking of each other over the miles and years and events that separate them. I gave this movie two stars solely on the basis of Jude Law's performance, which I thought was very well done (he almost made me believe that love stuff), especially considering that he has never ranked among my favorite actors. From cardboard villains to feminist-leaning heroines to a plot steadily sinking under a mass of phoney southern accents (granted that Zellweger's accent was real enough, just more Texas than Tennessee is all - and her little truisms were cute enough to make me ill) and more hormonal angst than one could conceive of in a film not about teenagers, this is not a movie to be trifled with. There is unwarranted nudity, inserted just to make you remember this is the South - as in Deliverance - you're watching, and it borders on the pornographic. The sex scene between hero and heroine is also overdone and unnecessary. Somebody PLEASE tell director Minghella that LESS IS MORE!
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I love Julia Roberts' glowing smile and infectious laugh, but this movie is just another clich&eacute; of the inspirational teacher. This time, it's not inner-city gang members, but privileged college girls at Wellesley who are motivated by a special teacher. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, in which Julia Roberts' character admits that marrying and raising a family might not be evil incarnate after all.
0894803123|4.0|I received a Cuisinart ice cream maker last Christmas and, while I have come up with some great ideas on my own, I was looking for some new ideas to try. This book fits that bill admirably. I have found LOTS of good inspiration here. My only complaint is that it is a bit dated in that nearly all of the recipes call for raw eggs. I wouldn't want to substitute Egg Beaters since my favorite part of the egg (and the part that adds the richness of flavor) is the yolk, which is what EB leaves out. I'm considering cooking the base to make the base a custard-base in order to get around this problem. I will use this cookbook a lot, I am sure, but hope they eventually come out with an updated version!
B000286RZM|5.0|John Frusciante has been a part of my life since I was 10 years old. I grew up listening to him and the post-Hilel Red Hot Chili Peppers, always paying closer attention to his guitar playing than I did to Anthony's singing or Flea's bass heroics. As cliched as this sounds, I suppose John is one of the few musicians I listen to, and I do listen to and enjoy a lot of musicians, whose work I can connect with spiritually. When I listen to John play the pieces I consider his most beautiful, I become filled with so much positive emotion I feel high. For whatever reason, I looked upon John's decision to release six albums throughout the remainder of the year with some trepidation. Would these albums live up to the high quality of Shdaows Collide With People? Was John Frusciante beginning to stretch himself thin? Would I even enjoy this record at all?  The Will to Death is, up to this point, my favorite piece of work by John Frusciante. John's solo music is so special to me that I am apprehensive about playing any of his first three solo albums for people because I know how angry I will get if they criticize John's playing or voice. Shadows Collide with People is safe in this regard because it is so overproduced and essentially a pop album at heart, although it is very personal to me as well. The production on the Will to Death represents the perfect medium between John's first three solo albums and his fourth. In my opinion, this is how every Frusciante album should be produced. The songs themselves are all beautiful, with the deeper, more introspective songs on an already lyrically deep and introspective album taking on a life of and creating worlds of their own. John's voice couldn't sound better and his minimalist guitar playing compliments his rejuvinated vocals perfectly, allowing for his poetry to take center stage for the first time. The song which best exemplifies this is the Mirror, with it's ethereal whisps of smoke and haunting piano playing, it examines the self-destructive psyche of an essentially good human being. At the emotional apex of the song, Frusciante sings a crystaline, &quot;Time doesn't crawl back to where it doesn't show, no one means me when they say people don't grow. The face in the mirror is not me.&quot; If you know anything about John Frusciante's life story, these lyrics and the sonic landscape they inhabit are familiar. Familiar is a good word for describing the subject matter Frusciante tackles on this record. Again, John examines ontological and psychological topics, such as loss, pain, life, death, consciousness, the nature of space-time, and reincarnation. John also examines love in the amazing Far Away, which sounds like something Lennon and Mccartney could have written if they had been able to reconcile during their solo careers in the 1970's because it meshes the two without ever really sounding Beatle-esque. My favorite song on the album is the mildly psychedelic &quot;Wishing&quot;, which has the amazing ability to transport me back to childhood every time I listen to it, in part becuase of the background chimes that recall the ice cream truck man in the summer. Other stand-outs include the opening tack Doubt, The Loop, Days Have Turned, and the Will to Death. As a side note, Helical is one the best John Frusciante instrumentals, rivaling Ramparts in its beauty. This album is a very high watermark to set for one's self, which makes me all the more excited for John's next five solo projects and the work he is supposedly doing with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Omar Rodriguez of Mars Volta. Thank you, John.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is the worst, most unoriginal movie ever. Terrible acting. Terrible plot. Monster as scary as Mickey Mouse. I like horro movies. I like even terrible horror movies. This movie is its own genre of dung. Save a few hours of your life and watch something else. Anyone who likes this movie is a nerd and don't listen to their advice to watch it.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|1. this is THE cute guy movie. from 8 to 80, small, tall, thin or round, this movie will have someone for you. i can only imagine my sister, who once had a list of 254 men she Truly Cared About that included people like the guy 3d from the left in the second scene of Star Trek 2, drooling like a pet of pavlov w/in the first 3 minutes.<br />2. &amp; speaking of star trek-----<br />russell crow _IS_ Captain James T. Kirk.<br />this is the most postmodern movie i have ever seen!!<br />here is an actor playing a captain playing an actor playing a captain!!<br />i think captainhood has been forever embedded in the mind of anyone young or old &amp; privileged enough to see the _real_  &amp; _only_ Star Trek as meaning one thing: William Shatner. watch the timing!! watch the _gestures_!! watch the way he looks at the camera. the likeness is uncanny!!<br />my partner watched this movie a couple of days before i did &amp; when i said to him, &quot;you know who that is--&quot; he said he had thought the same thing.<br />amazing!!<br />dont worry, i LOVE Captain James T. Kirk. when i was a very little kid, even younger than any of the little kids in this movie, my parents &amp; i saw him (the actor, not the captain) screaming at his girlfriend at a folk dance festival. that image is embedded in my brain as well!!<br />anyway.<br />Captain Kirk, in order to be Captain Kirk, MUST have his Spock. &amp; here, of course, he does. but oddly his Spock is only the entr&eacute;e into........<br />3. the Monty Python element. think John Cleese, younger (much much younger), w/ a lot of freckles &amp; a slightly skinnier jawline. think his uppercrust gestures &amp; the way he often looks up at you (thru the camera) w/ those eyes..... right here. Mr. Spock as a naturalist-warrior-sailor-doctor who also, on the side, runs the Ministry of Silly Walks.<br />but thats not all!!<br />you also get, in this movie that was modeled on &quot;Star Trek transports itself into Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail on the High Seas&quot; --the old guy. you remember the Old Guy. he is embedded in yr brain too. i know he is. &amp; it will be very very hard for you to watch a scene wherein he appears w/o thinking of eric idle, hanging on a dungeon wall &amp; singing. every single time.<br />but nobody is singing &quot;la marseillaise&quot; b/c when you finally do meet those french types, they are too busy yelling things like:<br />&quot;oh you english pig-dogs!!&quot; --you get that too!! i almost expected a bunch of fruit &amp; a cow to come flying over the side of the boat.<br />&amp; theres more-- so much more-- it makes ones brain itch trying to remember it all.....<br />4. &amp;, speaking of an itchy brain, in addition to heroic self-surgery, one also gets: trepanning. woohoo!! personally, i recommend amanda fielding's video (worth looking up) as she is doing real-life, real-time self-trepanning, but this one works as a little preview. &amp; besides, she doesnt stick a quarter into her skull.<br />5. &amp;, wait, there is so much more!! poop on the poopdeck (rewind or you will miss it. my partner, who worked on lots of boats made us rewind so i wouldnt miss it)-- &amp; LOTS &amp; LOTS of animals. i LOVE this movie!!<br />but probably not in the way that peter weir intended. which is why i gave it 4 stars. it is the most postmodern movie i have ever seen. the whole thing seems plotted, directed &amp; acted as if it were a bunch of archetypal television programs strung together or laid on top of one another (lets not forget marlon brando (rip) in &quot;mutiny on the bounty,&quot; although that might just have been inspiration for the costumes) (&amp; do remember &quot;the poseiden adventure&quot; &amp; undoubtedly &quot;titanic&quot; (i havent seen it)) w/ unbelievably fabulous images of oceans, islands, ground &amp; ships-- just gorgeous stuff from the director of &quot;the last wave.&quot;<br />&amp; yes, it is a roiling barrel of entertainment.il on the High Seas&quot; --the old guy. you remember the Old Guy. he is embedded in yr brain too. i know he is. &amp; it will be very very hard for you to watch a scene wherein he appears w/o thinking of eric idle, hanging on a dungeon wall &amp; singing. every single time.<br />but nobody is singing &quot;la marseillaise&quot; b/c when you finally do meet those french types, they are too busy yelling things like:<br />&quot;oh you english pig-dogs!!&quot; --you get that too!! i almost expected a bunch of fruit &amp; a cow to come flying over the side of the boat.<br />&amp; theres more-- so much more-- it makes ones brain itch trying to remember it all.....<br />4. &amp;, speaking of an itchy brain, in addition to heroic self-surgery, one also gets: trepanning. woohoo!! personally, i recommend amanda fielding's video (worth looking up) as she is doing real-life, real-time self-trepanning, but this one works as a little preview. &amp; besides, she doesnt stick a quarter into her skull.<br />5. &amp;, wait, there is so much more!! poop on the poopdeck (rewind or you will miss it. my partner, who worked on lots of boats made us rewind so i wouldnt miss it)-- &amp; LOTS &amp; LOTS of animals. i LOVE this movie!!<br />but probably not in the way that peter weir intended. which is why i gave it 4 stars. it is the most postmodern movie i have ever seen. the whole thing seems plotted, directed &amp; acted as if it were a bunch of archetypal television programs strung together or laid on top of one another (lets not forget marlon brando (rip) in &quot;mutiny on the bounty,&quot; although that might just have been inspiration for the costumes) (&amp; do remember &quot;the poseiden adventure&quot; &amp; undoubtedly &quot;titanic&quot; (i havent seen it)) w/ unbelievably fabulous images of oceans, islands, ground &amp; ships-- just gorgeous stuff from the director of &quot;the last wave.&quot;<br />&amp; yes, it is a roiling barrel of entertainment.
B00003CXCT|5.0|For those who are \\"complaining\\" about these really are not the \\"origional\\" versions of Star Wars, keep in mind that when George Lucas first made Star Wars: A New Hope, he made an incomplete movie. He knew that there were some scenes in this movie that he would not be able to finish the way he \\"origionally\\" intended because of the limited technology back in the mid 1970's. Now some 25 years later, technology has advanced enough that he is now capable of completeing the movies the way he intended.<br />These are George Lucas' movies. He wrote and produced them and even directed the first one. They are still his movies and now he is completing them the way he wants.<br />Don't forget about the scene in A New Hope when Han Solo meets up with Jabba the Hut at Moss Eisley Space Port. That scene was not in the origional theater release, but it was filmed during the making of the movie fully knowing that that scene would not be able to be completed for another 20 years.<br />The DVD version of these movies will be great. I couldn't wait to see the movie when I saw the first trailors back when I was a kid in the 70's and now I can't wait till Sept 21 for the DVD release.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin, by Avril Lavigne, released May 25th 2004 is much better then her first album, Let Go. Lavigne has expanded her horizons with her genre and topics. Where before she was acceptable for a tween audience, her new songs have much more mature themes.<br />From the start of Under My Skin, Take Me Away explains Avril wanting to get away from everything in life. This song along with the new album features much more dynamic guitar work and background effects, including much more distortion. Also this song showcases Lavigne screaming \\"yeah\\" as a transition between verses, which is a really nice touch.<br />Her very sad and emotional song, Nobody's Home, explains how her friend makes the same mistakes that Lavigne has made and there is nothing that [Lavigne] can do to help her. She \\"watched her make the same mistakes again\\". She explains how her friend has no place to go, no home. She lies around broken inside. The song dynamics and lyrics go together very well and give the song an awesome, powerful and touching touch. Although this song is very depressing.<br />And then song number twelve, Slipped Away, is by far the saddest song on the entire CD. It talks about one of Lavigne's friends who \\"slipped away\\" or committed suicide. She reminisces in graphic detail about her friend and \\"the day you slipped away\\" and how her friend's suicide has permanently shaped her life into something unhappy. She \\"never got around to kiss [her] goodbye on the hand\\" before the suicide. Although this song is very sad, its very inspiring. The message of a friend's love for another friend.<br />I reiterate that this album is not for kids or pre-teens. It has very mature messages in it, mild profanity and mild sexuality. But as an older teenager, I give this album five stars. It is very touching, entertaining and just all in all an awesome album.
006092988X|5.0|I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn when I was about twelve years old, and I decided to give it a whirl once again. I recommend that adults who loved this book as a child return to it because the magic of reading it is as wonderful and beautiful in your adult years as it was when you were a child. The story of Francie Nolan and her family will most likely have a different and interesting effect on the reader, or at least it had a different effect on me this time around. Francie is a bright young girl growing up in a poor, but hardworking family in 1912 Brooklyn. Although her life is a constant struggle over money, she still manages to eke out much joy. The novel, which does not really have a plot, is rather a collection of vignettes about Francie's life. While so much of her life appeared to be conspiring against her success, she never gave in to defeatism. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an inspiring and beautiful story that people of all ages will love. I cannot recommend this book enough.
B000093BDX|5.0|I can't think of a better compilation of a single band's work than this!<br />I've always been of two minds regarding the Beach Boys.  On one hand they can provide fuel for cynics by producing songs with trite lyrics that look silly beyond belief on the printed page.  But when you listen to the music and their harmonies, you quickly fall under the spell of fantastic musicianship.  They can be crass and commercial in the extreme, with concerts that are formulaic and multiple &quot;Best of...&quot; collections that only exploit the show business maxim of &quot;always leave them wanting more.&quot;  But there is nothing to criticize here... nothing at all.<br />When all is said and done, it's about the music, and the music of the Beach Boys is something special!  Listening to this collection of thirty hits (with nary a clinker among them), you can almost wear yourself out just tapping your foot and moving with the music.<br />Ask any group of fans for their favorite Beach Boys classic, and you'll likely get a different answer from each; my vote would be for Sloop John B.  But I'd be willing to bet that 99% of the population will fine their own &quot;my favorite Beach Boys&quot; song on this CD.  And they will sing/hum/dance or drum along with every cut on this fantastic body of work!
B0002234LS|4.0|Overall this film kept me right on the edge of the seat, and that's why I give it the four stars. Jonny Depp was great in this movie. He looked exactly like a writer- tousled hair, hilariously tattered robe, the works. He worked the part of a lonely writer perfectly. He played this 'lonely writer' who is obviously still tortured about his wife's infidelity and their divorce they are finishing through, and then to add to his problems a guy comes to his door and claims he stole his story. Throughout the entire movie I was kept in suspense, because I honestly didn't know what was going to be the solution of this plot. <BR>And yet the solution is where I dropped one star. The ending was a total killer for me. I don't know why, but in the back of my mind I made the assumption that this guy accusing Depp's character of plagirism was a lot more than he turned out to be. I won't ruin the ending for people who haven't seen it, but trust me, the ending is not explosive, not surprising, not anything. It's just a dull 'oh yeah' kind of ending. But all in all, the beginning and middle of this film are gripping and awesome, so the movie's worth that much to watch it.
B000002WPI|5.0|This CD is impeccable.  Except for that one idiot who's claiming 50 is the greatest, i think we all agree that this cd is nearly flawless.  I'd say that every track is the best song on the cd.  I highly reccomend this is your a wu fan at all, and if youre not, you should probably buy it and give it to someone who is, therefore making their life complete.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles left very deep footprints, and, love them or hate them, they are a cultural force to be reckoned with. The White Album represents both the peak of their art and the nadir of their personal relationships within the group (only to be surpassed by the gruesome Let It Be sessions...). Less of a group effort, each of Fabs here showcase their individual songwriting and singing talents, using the others as session players. They decisively destroy the image of the four happy pop clones of 1964. It was a liberating move for the musicians, but it can also be a jarring experience for the listener. It is a massive, sprawling masterwork that occasionally verges on complete collapse. The Beatles were never afraid to push the envelope to breaking point and beyond: The White Album is a case-in-point. As a historical document, The White Album can be heard as the \\"come down\\" from the Summer of Love, a testament to the idealism and disillusion (and dissipation) of 1968 (the year that saw the murder of both Martin Luther King and the death of the dream of peace, both within the US and internationally with the escalation of the Vietnam War). The minimalist cover artwork can be seen as the inevitable antidote to the colorful and florid excesses of Flower Power fashion. The White Album is a historical moment preserved in song. Matching the anguish and uncertainty of the era is the anguish and schizophrenia of the Beatles music on this record.<br />Many (including producer George Martin) have complained that the album is too long and includes tracks of inferior quality, that it could have been boiled down to a single album of solid gold. Honestly, there is something here to offend everybody. While most people (including Paul McCartney) find Revolution #9 unlistenable, it was a major achievement of experimental electronica at the time, and it bears repeated listening (but not when you're in an Obla-di Obla-da mood!). You may find yourself consistently skipping over several  tracks, like Why Don't We Do It in the Road?, Wild Honey Pie, Good Night, Don't Pass Me By because they're all put-ons. <br />I find myself skipping over some tracks, like Yer Blues, not because it's a poorly written tune, but because it's just too emotionally painful, which is actually an acknowledgement of Lennon's success as an artist. He was in pain, and he conveyed it all too clearly. Helter Skelter, on the other hand, is completely empty of meaning, yet is absolutely hair-raising, perhaps the most terrifying pop song ever (after I Am the Walrus). The frantic clanging of Everybody's Got Something to Hide matches perfectly with Lennon's manic mood and mystical mind at the time. He describes the most profound LSD and/or meditation experience - \\"Your outside is in/when your inside is out\\" - but the way he sings it, it sounds like he's being torn apart by the experience, making the song both inspiring and frightening. I'm So Tired is such an effective evocation of apathy, insomnia, and frustration that it also makes my hair stand on end, esp. when he screams \\"I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind!\\" That song has fit into the soundtrack of my life alarmingly well. In short, some people might be put off by The White Album because it is too emotionally charged and artistically adventurous. It wasn't designed as musical wallpaper and refuses to be reduced to that. You have to be prepared to listen to The White Album. When you are, it's an exhilirating experience. If not, it might make you want to puke.<br />The contrast in mood between the tracks is most jarring. Lennon snarls at his fans in Glass Onion, layers sarcasm on gun lovers in Happiness is a Warm Gun, pointedly berates the Left in Revolution #1, savagely attacks the Maharishi in Sexy Sadie, wails of suicide in Yer Blues. In contrast, McCarney offers some of his mildest, sweetest  songs - I Will, Blackbird, and Mother Nature's Son, as well as the syrupy, music hall kitsch of Honey Pie, MarthaMy Dear, and Rocky Raccoon. None of McCartney's tracks here are \\"deep,\\" but if you're in the mood for some tasty musical candies, these fit the bill quite nicely. Obladi Oblada is perhaps the best of the fluffy treats here. If this is your first exposure to the Beatles, you might well wonder how the group could contain such dramatic differences in temperament. (In fact, it couldn't, and would soon collapse because of those very differences in personality).<br />The classic tunes of this collection certainly more than justify the purchase of the two-disc set. John offers the stunning ode to his lost mother (and to Yoko) entitled Julia. George Harrison scores perhaps his greatest triumph with While My Guitar Gently Weeps (featuring Eric Clapton on lead guitar). Lennon's Dear Prudence is another touching masterpiece, written to order to induce Prudence Farrow to quit hiding out in her bungalow at Rishikesh. Ultimately, The White Album has something to delight everyone. If you prefer to avoid some tracks, you are among the majority of listeners. That's par for The White Album course. Once again, the inconsistency of the album accurately portrays the mind of each of the Beatles at the time as well as the larger cultural environment of 1968. It is required listening for anyone interested in 20th c. pop music. But be forewarned, it's not a smooth ride.
0767830555|5.0|To start this off, I'll just say this: Do yourself a favor and buy this fantastic film. If for nothing else, buy it for DeNiro's INCREDIBLE performance! I'm a movie buff myself, and I have never seen such amazing acting. It's a crime he didn't win the oscar. Secondly, it's directed by Martin Scorsese, one of the more brilliant filmmakers of our time, and written by Paul Schrader. This is the team that brought you Raging Bull. When these two geniuses get together, they make pure movie magic. And finally, Jodie Foster. She's only fourteen years old, and beautifully brings to life the child prostitute who is secretly hating the horrible city she lives in. One of the most brilliant touches of filmmaking was made here when Scorsese portrays NYC as hell, such as focusing on the smoke spewing out of the sewers, and making Betsy, Travis Bickle's love, seem like an angel among all the demons. <br />     The story goes something like this: Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) Is a taxi driver who can't seem to sleep. He works at night, and the city around him fills him with paranoia, for the gangsters and the slime on the streets at night every day seem to be everywhere. Among all of these demons and devils, Travis sees an angel, a gorgeous woman named Betsy. He immediately falls in love with her, but his anti-social tendencies scare her off when he brings her to a pornographic movie on their second date, thinking it was just like all of the other movies. When she leaves him and won't return any of his phone calls, his depression rises until he meets a child prostitue named Iris (Jodie Foster) and her pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel). Feeling the deepest sympathy for her, he tries to help her leave that terrible lifestyle, not believing her pleas that she loves her being a prostitute and loves her pimp.<br />      To sum this whole review up, do yourself a favor and watch this great piece of work. See Scorsese's nightmarish vision of NYC, and Travis Bickle's slow descent into insanity.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard the single &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; on FUSE, and I thought it was ultra-catchy.  I decided that I'd buy their album immediately upon it's release.  So, I pre-ordered it here and waited patiently.  When I first listened to it, I was immediately struck by how much I liked *every song.*  I'm normally the type of person who needs to listen to a new album a few times before I like it, but not this time.<br />My top three songs of the album are &quot;Andy, You're a Star,&quot; &quot;Jenny Was a Friend of Mine&quot; and &quot;Smile Like You Mean It.&quot;  I'm not one to normally gush over bands, but Hot Fuss is a purchase that won't let you down.
0671027387|2.0|i read this in essentially one sitting, on a plane.  it's the first time in my adult life i've read one of these junk-food-for-the-brain thrillers that you see lined up in airport bookshops. and i now see the use of these sorts of books. it's a good way to utterly distract yourself while you're stuffed into an uncomfortable seat for several hours.<br />the reading experience was a mixture of guilty pleasure and embarassment.  i'm a sucker for the techno-gee-wizardry and the intrigue, but at the same time i was astonished by the utter lameness of the writing... particularly the dialogue.  the characters were 1-dimensional and completely uninteresting.  i kept hoping the protaganists would die, which would lend a modicum of realism and unpredictability.  but these characteristics were in short supply.  and while i'm a lefty crank myself, i found the heavy-handed and simplistic left-wing bias nauseating.  in this world, republicans are sinister and souless dastardly demons, and democrats are lofty and righteous.  gag me.<br />the action sequences left me cold, and honestly could have been written by a seventh grader (the escape off the ice shelf in particular was just plain silly).<br />i will admit however that i allowed myself to be taken in by the plot, which was a fun ride and kept me turning the pages.  but my guess it's like a million other books that have similar-looking covers and similar-sounding (and meaningless) names.<br />and for god sakes there was *product placement* in this book! i think dan brown must have made deals with various manufacturers of outdoor gear as he makes numerous references to brands such as Thinsulate.<br />i was planning on reading the da vinci code, but unless someone convinces me that d.b.'s wrinting skills have leapt forward by orders of magnitude then i'm not going to bother.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I thought Nightwish would be putting an album after album sounding roughly the same - power metal with operatic vocals and a bit of gothic influences. But I was wrong. &quot;Once&quot; incoroprates symphonic elements simply superbly, it's heavier than the other albums and Marco Hetala is singing flawlessly. Yes, Tarja doesn't often uses her highest vocal ranges in &quot;Once&quot;  but I don't think that's because she no longer can but simply because the spotlight is moved a bit from her to the instrumental parts instead. And in whatever way she sings, Tarja is still the best female metal vocalist, IMHO. I have been trying for ages to find anyone equal to her but to no avail (Theatre of Tragedy and Lacuna Coil's vocals come come close but not enough). <BR>The songs in the new album are very diverse especially considering this is Nightwish, not the most versatile band out there. From the furious pace of &quot;Dark Chest of Wonders&quot; to the slow paced beauty of &quot;Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan&quot;, the band shows everything it has to offer. Tuomas is outdone himself with the compositions especially in &quot;Ghost Love Score&quot;. Yes, it's not the most original album by any stretch of the imagination but if I want originality I would listen to some prog-metal group like Pain of Salvation and frankly the power/gothic metal bands as a whole lack originality.<BR>At first I wasn't very impressed with the new album but I listened more and it really grew on me. I am pretty sure most Nightwish fans should like &quot;Once&quot;. I rate it to as the best Nightwish album, just a bit better than &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. As for the others - &quot;Oceanborn&quot; is maybe a better place to start getting into the band.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Okay, well, who knows what my taste will be like when I'm an old person?  But, I know what I like at this phase in my life, and it is precisely what Franz Ferdinand dishes out: unabashed, fun, get-up-and-dance rock music.  From start to finish, this album is highly listenable.  It's one of those discs that you can have on in the background and not get sick of it on repeat for a few hours, AND you can sit and listen to the lyrics and still appreciate it.  People who say they dislike FF seem to have lost all ability to laugh and have fun without pretension.  While music elitists seem rather disappointed that this band has achieved a wide fan base in a short time, the rest of us will be enjoying ourselves on the dance floor.

B00002SWEM|4.0|I was &quot;introduced&quot; to the Latin music by my Brazilian neighbor, but give Ry Cooder his due folks. Most of these marvelous Cuban musicians would still be only memories of your Grandparents had Cooder and Wender (sp)? not put the recordings and DVD together. Documentary or concert tape? who cares? I loved the music and since I've never been to Havana or Cuba, the video section of Ry and his son putting along on their motorcycle thru the city's streets to the recording studio were wonderful background for me.<BR>Am I going to quit searching for Cuban / Latin music because I &quot;found&quot; Buena Vista Social Club? Hell no... I'm looking for more!! Does Ry Cooder's steel guitar work blend in with the Cuban sounds? Ahhh... Who cares? How much Gerry Garcia / Jimi Hendrix crap did we have to listen to... to get to the meat of their talent?<BR>Give it a rest folks.. Or better yet- share some of the discographys of your favorite Latin players, young and old!!<BR>THAT would be really fun!<BR>But quit whining
B000059H99|5.0|They just don't make 'em like they used to.  Sylvester Stallone had to learn that the hard way, after making countless, subpar action movies for twenty years.  He went down a spiriling escalator to become a watered-down, Hollywood celebrity.  However, that's not what people were saying back in 1976, and rightfully so.  &quot;Rocky&quot; is Sly's crowning achievement, and ranks as one of, if not the best, sports movie ever made, and one of the greatest motion pictures of the last three decades.  The story is nothing short of compelling.  Based loosely on the fifteen-round fight between Chuck Wepner and Muhammad Ali (as the DVD will tell you if you don't know), &quot;Rocky&quot; weaves a perfect storyweb centering around the title character Rocky Balboa (Stallone).  One of the most beloved characters in movie history, Rocky is a tough but good-natured man from the mean streets of Philadelphia; a loan shark goon by day, and boxer by night, under the moniker of The Italian Stallion.  Despite working two jobs, he's on the brink of bumhood, and has no luck impressing his belligerent boxing trainer Mickey (played magnificently by Burgess Meredith) nor impressing the local pet shop girl Adrian (Talia Shire).  However, when World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) gives him a shot at the title for the Bicentennial Match to be held in Philadelphia, it gives Rocky a glimmer of hope, to rise above the odds and go the distance.  <br />The story alone is incredibly gripping, but so is the acting.  Stallone is in top form as The Italian Stallion.  Immensely likable, melancholy, and incredibly human, the Rocky of this movie sadly disappears as the sequels go on.  Burt Young also does a great job as disgruntled butcher Paulie, who is jealous of Rocky's offer at redemption.  And who can forget the training montage?  No one.  &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; is a classic, through and through.  <br />Overall, owe it to yourself to at least RENT &quot;Rocky&quot;.  If you haven't seen any of them, start with this one, because its sequels cannot hold a candle to it.  It's a gritty, rousing, realistic, touching collage of romance, comedy, drama, allegory, action, and sports.  Watch it ASAP.<br />MOVIE-10/10<BR>DVD EXTRAS-5/10

B00008O31H|5.0|This album is Great. I don't know how these two guys managed to get such a soulful sound while using so few resources, but I'm glad they did. Both of their albums (see also: The Big Come Up)are the kind that I never get tired of. But I should say, that I think Thickfreakness is the stronger of the two because it has a less retro sound. Check this album out, there's never a dull moment.

1400034779|4.0|After the death of her father, Precious Ramotswe uses the inheritance to buy herself a house and an office from which she starts the first detective agency in Botswana. Business starts slowly, but she gets a number of clients with problems ranging from missing husbands to fraudulent employees and she starts to build up a reputation leading to new clients. The book describes some of the cases that Mma Ramotswe solves, but the real star of the book is Africa: there are long, loving descriptions of the nature, the people, the culture and the life in Africa and anybody who has been to Africa (and subsequently loves the continent despite all its problems) can use this book to refresh their memories and long back to those real African nights. Don't read this as a detective but as a book about Africa.
B00009TB5G|5.0|OMG! I love this movie so much, I never put it back in the case...it's always in the dvd player. If you at all liked the original theatrical version, you HAVE to get the extended version. The addded footage completes the story and fills in character developement. And you HAVE to listen to the cast commentary. Dom and Billy are hilarious. And the bonus disks are well worth the money. Forget that...added Viggo footage makes it WELL worth it. Plus, the box is beautiful.
B00005ATQD|5.0|It's no surprise to me that 'Eyes Wide Shut' was instantly rejected by mainstream audiences, who were probably expecting a soft porn movie along the same lines as 'Basic Instinct.' There is nudity and sex in the film, but it is Kubrickian nudity and sex - in other words, it's cold and vaguely off-putting, and we suspect that it is not a celebration of the procreative act.  Kubrick is far to classy a director to allow a movie 12 years in the making to be a piece of erotic titillation.<br />This is a very rich, visually lavish, and deep film; Kubrick shows an expertise with expressive colors that we haven't seen so full-blown since his 'a Clockwork Orange.' The giant ballroom, with its bright red carpet and robed occupants, is destined to become a legendary Kubrick set piece, along the same lines as the Korova milkbar, the War Room, and the deep space victorian bedroom.<br />Kubrick's use of music here is unusual but compelling nonetheless.  He masterfully uses Ligeti's minimalistic piano music to set the mood and heighten the tension, and the ceremonial chants of the orgy sequence are sublimely haunting.<br />Perhaps the only drawback is Nicole Kidman's performance; a limited actress in the first place, it doesn't help that she's required to act half asleep or stoned through most of her screen time.  She pauses, draws out sentences, stammers, uses body language excessively, and in general annoys the heck out of me.  Surprisingly, I have no complaints about Tom Cruise.  He has proven, in Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, that he is a real actor.<br />Kubrick's final film is the work of a filmmaker who knows everything about film; watch it and be awed by his effortless command of the camera.
B00004XONN|1.0|Pointless, redundant, possibly the worst form of per capita matter that has ever taken up space on this earth. I was not a huge fan of OK Computer, but I liked it. I felt the same about the bends. But this album is just plain trash. How is it getting five star reviews you ask? I will tell you. The people who are giving this album five stars are people who call themselves &quot;anti-corporate,&quot; hiding behind such facades as &quot;if you like Kid A don't listen to Britany Spears&quot; or &quot;not for people who listen to corporate radio&quot; or &quot;this is a very deep and emotional album.&quot; To the contrary, I hate Britany Spears, I don't listen to the radio, and I can say this is not a deep emotional album. This is pure unadulterated crap. It is deep for the sake of being deep, and with this ideology comes the making of shallow people listening to &quot;deep&quot; music, or is &quot;deep&quot; people listening to shallow music? Either way, the record is crap. You think it's groundbreaking? The ground has been broken by bands like Rush and Sigur Ros. Why do overrated bands get to produce crap like this and sell millions of copies? Because the sheepish people who don't consider themselves sheep because they listen to &quot;abstract&quot; music buy it in order to get their &quot;anti-normal points.&quot; Who keeps count anyway?<br />Anyone who actually has a sense of what it is to listen to music for the actual enjoyment of it should stay as far away from this album as possible.
B00005JN0A|1.0|Sounded promising, I don't mind brainless comedies, but this was absolutely the biggest waste of celluoid ever produced.

B00024BHTC|3.0|With Once, Nightwish continue their tradition of being a middle-rate band. Not bad by any means but certainly not great either. As far as this compares to their other stuff, it's probably in about the middle of their discography in quality. Better than Angels Fall First and Wishmaster, about the same as Over the Hills and far Away and Century Child and not as good as Oceanborn. Tarja sounds worse than ever and I've got to suspect that maybe she's a chainsmoker or had some sort of throat sickness when this was recorded. I know she's a classically trained singer, but so are a million choir students across the world. That dosen't neccasarily make her or them a great choice for a metal album. The rest of this sounds exactly like their old albums. Power metal mixed with synths and symphonies. While using symphonies was interesting back when Tristania and Therion first did it, it's become very boring and cliche now. <br />My main problem with this is many bands do the same thing with much more skill. If you want something that sounds like this but only 100x better check out Alas:Absolute Purity. Within Temptation, After Forever, Epica and This Ascention also sound similar but much better. If your just looking for bands with female vocalists check out Rhea's Obsession, Tristania, Sirenia, ...How Like A Winter, Brave, the Gathering, Lacuna Coil, or Cybele.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film is David Lynch doing what he does best: screwing with people's heads until they want to smash their VCRs.  There's everything you expect from Lynch; bizarre, dreamlike situations, whacked-out characters with no clearly defined purpose, an inexplicably foreboding atmosphere.  Oh, and of course, the entire cast shifting identities in the last half hour.  While I loved it, there was one particular moment which was a bit too unsettling, even for Lynch.  You see, there's this elderly couple who appear at the beginning.  They're kind of strange, and have smiles plastered on their faces.  They disappear for the next two hours, which is nothing new.  Near the end, they show up again - as...hyperactive two-inch tall midgets.  Even Eraserhead's singing worm creature didn't disturb me as much.  I mean, midgets are kind of disturbing, and old people who can't stop smiling are also kind of disturbing, and when you combine the two...<br /><br />Well, I've watched it five times and have no idea what is supposed to be happening.  Surprisingly, it really isn't that much of a problem.  This is an enjoyably twisted and eerie movie, and noone should be intimidated by its notorious ambiguity.  However, those with a phobia of evil imps, old overly cheerful people, or old, cheerful evil imps (that's where I draw the line) should steer clear.
0393324818|4.0|Michael Lewis deftly inserted himself into the A's front office to find out how a professional baseball team with a $40 million payroll can win 102 games and consistently 90 or more wins in subsequent years and compete with teams like the New York Yankees who have payrolls exceeding $130 million.<br />What he reveals is that by approaching baseball in a more rational, analytical way and doing away with all the traditional conventions, you can compete with anyone who doesn't do the same. Too many GMs and coaches are seduced by speed, home runs, and batters who swing at bad pitches when the simple truth of it is that in baseball the most precious thing you have are your three outs per inning. Anything that risks losing one or more of those outs is something you should avoid. As a long-time fan of the game, it's hard for me to swallow some of the anti-traditional things Lewis describes in this book. But the proof is in the pudding as they say and the A's success over the past several years is hard to argue with.<br />The focus of the book is A's GM Billy Beane, a former A's player himself who had a world of talent but could not transform that talent into a Hall of Fame career. He didn't have certain intangibles that are needed. Beane now recognizes those talents in the players he drafts, recruits and trades for. Beane's obsessive personality and unorthdox ways make for interesting reading. He's a man who seems horribly tortured by the game and yet thrives on his success in the game as well.<br />There are excellent mini-biographies in the book including one on A's first baseman, Scott Hatteberg, a Red Sox catcher who was thought all but done with baseball after he ruptured a nerve in his throwing arm. The A's reclamation project recognized a diamond in the rough and brought him aboard to train him as a first baseman, mostly so they could benefit from Hattie's shrewd batting.<br />Chad Bradford, the A's middle relief pitcher with the unorthodox pitching style and uncanny ability to get outs, is also profiled. A's minor league phenom Jeremy Brown, a former University of Alabama catcher who broke all sorts of NCAA records but wouldn't get a look from most pro teams, is also profiled. You get the sense from this book that there IS no traditional upbringing for a pro baseball player. The A's unusual collection of &quot;misfits&quot; all came from different backgrounds and most have taken a rather odd path to success.<br />This book is a great insiders look at a pro baseball team and how they approach the game from a very unique perspective. The most fascinating thing of it is, the A's didn't invent what they're doing at all. They're exploiting baseball wisdom that was anyone's for the taking for the past 30 years. You just need to know where to look.<br />If you're a baseball fan or just someone who can appreciate creativity and ingenuity in a world that promotes imitation, you'll enjoy this book.y ability to get outs, is also profiled.

B000005JA8|5.0|Opinions are divided about the Captain, as evidenced by the rabid one-star reviews and the equally rabid five-star reviews.  I have never seen a page this polarized. Let's just make one thing clear - you will never get this album on first listen.  Once you give it a couple of thorough listens, you can easily hear ideas, and then after that it will be pretty easy to see this album for what it is - rock music's equivalent of James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which I wouldn't call the greatest novel ever, but certainly one of the greatest. Listen to &quot;Ella Guru&quot; - this is the best individual example of the Captain's method. At the beginning, the guitars play one riff, one lead guitar, one rhythm (the rhythm part, though, admittedly is in a different time signature from the rest of the group) and keep playing that riff until the &quot;She got all the colors that nature do&quot; line.  They then abruptly switch to a different riff, over the bassline (which is in a different key, but harmonizes in odd places with the guitars) and drums' previous parts.  When we get to the &quot;High yellow high red high blue she blew/Hi Ella, high Ella Guru&quot; line, everything switches again to a different riff. This riff is transitional, with the guitars harmonizing, the bassline snaking around and around, and the drumming (which I believe is what turns many people off the most - the drumming is almost never in 4/4 and focuses on truly offbeat accents for most of the album) doing its stuff.  Then they go to the chorus, with that cowbell, and then the next section is a solo section, with the solo in the left speaker, with rhythm parts and bass and drums, then it changes again briefly, then back to the chorus. Throughout, everything that sounds &quot;wrong&quot; is repeated in a cohesive way, therefore becoming the song's riffs. And all the songs here, except for the a capella songs, &quot;Moonlight On Vermont&quot;, &quot;Veteran's Day Poppy&quot;, and &quot;China Pig&quot;,are like this. It's really not all that hard to comprehend. Beefheart's lyrics are fantastically visual and very humanistic glimpses of another universe. So I should really leave this to you to decide, but to me, this is crazed, wild genius splattered across the face of popular music.  I should also say that &quot;Moonlight On Vermont&quot; and &quot;China Pig&quot; are actually pretty conventional blues songs, and that &quot;Veteran's Day Poppy&quot; is a '60's protest song.  Not everything works here - I'm no fan of, say, &quot;Hobo Chang Ba&quot; - but mostly it does, which is why most of the one-star reviews sell the album short. Please give &quot;Ella Guru&quot; another listen with the step-by-step I gave - you might get it this time. I'm not trying to sound patronizing, because it is really very hard to get into.  But once you do, you'll never see music the same way again.  Come on - are you gonna listen to Good Charlotte for the rest of your life?
B0000067X1|5.0|Can's legendary Tago Mago is beyond comparison.  The songs are otherwordly, dense, and impossibly groovy, and the musicians are uniformly spectacular.  The rhythms pound away with tribal intensity, the keyboards shimmer and bubble and warble, the raw guitars belt out ingenious solos, and the vocals are just about indescribable.  Don't try to decipher the lyrics, just enjoy Damo Suzuki's voice mumbling and groaning and yelling insanely, and enjoy the totally unique and addictive sound of Can.  Tago Mago is guaranteed to be one of the most played albums in any collection.        This is an album that should be bought by any enthusiast of experimental music.  If you already have it, buy it anyways and give it to a friend.  It isn't just important as a forerunner of such modern genres as trance, ambient, industrial, rap, and techno, it's one of the pinnacles of 20th century music, as essential as any other modern composition.  Rock music has been an important part of our culture for fifty years and the fact that 'Tago Mago' is its pinnacle entitles it to be regarded as significant.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spiderman is the thrilling tale of Spiderman's birth, his conflict with his most nefarious villain, the undying Green Goblin, and the film which describes the beginnings of his adult relationships with Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osbourne. This film addresses the ancient myth of absolute good and absolute evil, and shows how these two can sometimes become blurred, but with a strong heart can be distinguished. Spiderman includes some exciting scenes of blood-spattering facial fist blows, but never strays into unneeded sensuality and apologetic expletives. A romp through the sky-alleys of a modern American city, Spiderman remains one of our contemporary classics which will be remembered as a landmark in the American mythos.      STUDY GUIDE: questions to think about while watching the film...      1. Humanity: What events in the film drove Peter Parker to adopting his vigilante attitude toward crime?<br />2. Implications: How is Spiderman's understanding of &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; an example of contemporary American thought? Think specifically about the nature of evil and the propensity toward intense individual classification when one's existence becomes threatened.<br />3. Evolution: Spiderman was a hero born out of the 60s, springing from both the dangers of genetic manipulation and the problems of substance abuse (in the form of Oscorp Chemicals). Raimi makes little mention of the chemical abuse in the story, and paints it in a much simpler picture of the probable evil in man's soul and the strange world of pseudoscience. Therefore, it is obvious that in many ways, the film departs from its traditional conditioning while remaining loyal to the original personalities of the characters. In which ways is Spiderman the hero shown to be a creation of the contemporary age, versus a creation of the 60s, in the film?<br />4. Realism: America has a long history, not only in comics but in legendary history, of people who take the law into their own hands. If a being like Spiderman existed, could he survive in our real world, or is he only a dream?<br />5. Stageplay: Spiderman is classicly a cynic, an individual thinker, an avid contemporarian (someone &quot;in&quot; the times), a man of passions (versus someone who could care less), an irreligious jokester and a man who is not sure of his destiny, but lives to succeed. Do you feel Maguire fulfills this role? Some critics say he is too much of a &quot;boy&quot; to fill Spiderman's shoes, while others claim it is his boyishness that charms us into belief. What do you think?
B000002UB3|3.0|Take out the songs that you can't even listen to such as /She So Heavy/Sun King/Because/- these are songs which lack creativity and rhythm. And why put in You never give me your money, it has the same rhythm as Carry that Weight. Why did they end in the ridiculous Her Majesty, and why is this overrated?...It is mere lyrics with simple beat. The Golden Slumbers lullaby is a brilliant ending. Come Together is an amazing beginning. Octopus' Garden and Maxwells silver hammer are very creative and essential to the Beatles culture. Mean Mr Mustard- what is the purpose of this song, Poythene Pam is humourous- (for whoever can understand the humour. The album needs editing, its needs filtering. It needs to be more concise in terms of style. Mixing good songs with crappy songs will produce a moderate album- which is exactly what Abbey Road is!
0380789035|4.0|1. Reflections: When this book was written, it became an immediate bestseller.  Previously, Gaiman had only been known for his lengthy and verbose Sandman graphic novels, more of a specialist collection of the strange and beautiful.  Why did people respond so well to American Gods?<br />2. Thematics: American Gods continually claims that the existence of gods is only because we need them, and when we lose the need, they fade into oblivion.  Does Gaiman offer any solutions to this problem?<br />3. Characterization: From the moment we are introduced to him Shadow remains a mystery.  As we follow him on his journey, it could be said that he is a walking shadow.  Yet there is a deeper significance of his name.  What is it?<br />4. Symbolism: Gaiman asserts that many objects in today's world, such as historical monuments, popular festivals, and contemporary philosophies, had their roots in a pan-theological foundation, or from the hands of many gods.  What examples do you see in American Gods?  What examples do you see that Gaiman doesn't mention?<br />5. Authorship: In Gaiman's other works, he often writes about similar themes.  The gods in the contemporary world, the reality of the dream, the immortal nature of the spirit world, the failing of the gods to appease mortals and thus are forgotten, the mastery of the human over the material but limited in the spiritual: these are all themes be tries to work into his books.  In what ways does Gaiman break with his tradition in American Gods?  In what ways has his philosophy changed by becoming a novelist?
B00028HBKM|5.0|i stepped out of my car with my friend and as i was walking to get tickets for this movie i almost got ambushed by a group of \\"church goers\\" as young as 5.I was thinking great. As i walked up to the ticket counter i got all these bad looks and evil eyes. the line for this movie was longer than i had ever seen.me being on the other side of the religious spectram as the concept of this movie, feeling like i was going to be beaten to death with bibles. the subtitles began to role, i watched with delight at how jesus in the movie looked more beautiful than all the books i had ever seen him in... great efects and fabulous acting.. And man was Satan looking better than ever. WOW!! i said in my head everytime they showed her.. The movie was great over all.. nothing about it was bad.. even the story was good. a big gory for some ages i seen in the theater. Since it was jesus i guess it was ok for younger kids to view this. An excelent movie in my eyes.. it had everything a movie should have.. most of the great movies in time have been true stories. this was one of the best fiction movies i have ever seen.. i recomend it to anyone.. religious or not.. its great
B00005JMYG|5.0|i thought this was a really funny movie.  And i dont lead a shallow life.  You may walk out thinking that it was odd but then you begin remembering all of the funny stuff that happened.  If you like Will Ferre then you like Will Ferrel, adn if you dont, then why did you even go see the movie? dorks!
B0001I55OC|3.0|Abraham doesnt sound like too intelligent of a reviewer so I will try and make sense of it.<br />The movie is entertaining, if LOOSELY based off the incredible book by Michael Crichton. (Abraham, i suggest you read the book before blathering off about something you know nothing about)<br />There are plot holes, bad acting, and less than stellar wardrobes. But if you have read the book, it is still entertaining to see the characters on screen and see the story in action.
B000066NW0|2.0|i'm not going to lie. she comes off as this punky chick, but once she opens her mouth i just want to smack her. this album promises but does not deliver. with what she says her influences are, you'd expect something hard, of the ramones at the most, of green day/blink 182 at the least. but this album has NOTHING to do with anything she is supposed to represent. it is not a punk album, it is not what her character portrays. it is exactly what she always speaks out against, pure pure pop with a tad bit mix of country in it. there is no quality in this album, it is another teeny bopper piece of crap. too much whining. i feel sorry i borrowed this album. my advice, preview it online, the static from the poor streaming does the songs more justice. why 2 stars? it is poppy and catchy, that's all.
B00005JMEW|5.0|i loved this film! great STYLE, great action, great story. and very funny. i loved the use of zamfir's famous tune for the samurai scene! it's a delicious homage (or parody?!) of various genres - japanese samurai (esp kurosawa), chinese kung fu, american spaghetti westerns. wonderful.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Mere words cannot describe just how awful this movie is.  While I was certainly not expecting Shakespeare in the Park, I did expect something resembling a storyline and dialogue that sounded like it was coming from people with more than two brain cells to rub together.  I'm sure the audience is supposed to just ignore the Matrix-wannabe fight scenes, but this just went too far out.  I'm all for the &quot;girl power&quot; idea that Drew Barrymore thinks she is portraying in this movie, but back flips and martial arts moves in four inch stilletos?  Puh-leeze!  The only bright spots of this mish-mash of a movie are Bernie Mac and Demi Moore - who unlike the present angels, looks like someone who actually could kick some a## (trust me, the present angels are so ditzy and insipid, you are praying that Demi Moore will succeed in killing them).  But even the only two characters that don't make you want to retch look embarrassed at some of the dialogue they are forced to speak in this ridiculous movie.  The first movie was silly, but had a few fun moments... this one is just plain bad unless you're a fourteen year old boy in search of a T&amp;A fest.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I really have to say that I like this new album.  I have all of their other albums, and each has its own redeeming qualities. Their DVD Disasterpieces is pretty good as well.   <br />One might venture a guess that there's a twinge of Stone Sour's influence in this album.  They're pretty cool too.  I love Corey Taylor's voice!<br />I like all of the songs on this album.  It shows the new direction that the band is going in.  I have yet to take the CD (or any of their CDs) from my CD changer in my car... I crank the radio when I listen to these guys, they rock!<br />For those that don't like Slipknot, you are entitled to your opinion.  I just think that these guys (in many of their songs) express the anger and frustration that many of us feel.  I am tired of the wimpy rock that everyone's making these days.  It's a change of pace for me to listen to a Slipknot CD while everyone else is listening to whatever the heck they're playing on pop radio these days - Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, you name it.  <br />The cool thing about Vol 3 is that they changed their style.  You can't fault them for wanting to make a record that's different from the predecessors.  Give them time guys, I am sure they'll make another CD that will suit your tastes!
B00004VXF2|1.0|If you listen to the samples and read the reviews, you should be wise enough not to buy this horrible baboonshine of an album. However, here comes my two main reasons why you should never even consider to buy it: <br />1. It has no substance. The painting by Jackson Pollock and music by John Cage most definately has a substance to it. MMM hasn't, for one simple reason: Lou Reed is a songwriter, not a composer. He never had the skill to carry out a project as this. <br />2. The CD format. As the music has no substance, the nature of the double vinyl album was of essential importance. As one small, convenient compact disc, the album simply isn't the same, as a lot of its conceptual value is lost.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i really loved this cd and love the whole tracklist every song was great and cant wait to see the next cd . iread the track list on [...] and thats great if its the right tracjklist go check it out.<BR>by the way she is so talent and every albu,m she releases is going better and better .
0380789035|3.0|This book was beautifully written, but I just seemed too fragmented to make much sense.  Maybe the concept is just over my head, but I found I didn't enjoy it.  I found the characters interesting and complex, but the book seemed to lack cohesiveness.  Perhaps it culminated into something that made sense at the end, but I couldn't wait that long.  I opted to give it up and read something that fell more in line with the usual shape of fiction.
B000066NW0|1.0|This is one of the most terrible album, I have ever heard in the last ten years.
B000063DFN|5.0|...this CD is an amazing piece of work from the best of the  NWOBHM bands.  Sadly, a fellow by the name of &quot;lucifer_666&quot; doesn't appear to agree.  He appears to prefer King Diamond, stating that &quot;those guys [Note:  He means King Diamond here, sadly, not Iron Maiden] are an awsome band with talent and originality and amazing solos with intense lirycs&quot;.<BR>Now, I've never heard any King Diamond, so I can't judge them as opposed to Iron Maiden.  But if this is the intelligence level of their average fan, I shall stay as far away from them as humanly possible.  I don't know if Steve Harris ever has written &quot;intense lirycs&quot;, but this is probably because I don't know what the hell a &quot;liryc&quot; is.  Sigh.  Still, I suppose that this is all you can expect from someone that calls themself &quot;lucifer&quot; in order to get attention.  I AM TEH EVIL!  PAY ATNETION TO MEEE!!1111!!!!1111 OMG LOL<br />Really, though, this album rules.  You can't beat Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.  Best Maiden song ever.  Aces High, 2 Minutes To Midnight, The Duellists, and Powerslave (the title track) itself ain't exactly bad either.  Second best Maiden album - nothing beats Number Of The Beast.  Powerslave, however, is better than even the substantial achievements of Brave New World, Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, Piece Of Mind, and Somewhere In Time.  And I won't even go into how superior it is to the Blaze Bayley albums.  To summarize:  Get this album.  But try to listen to other tracks than &quot;Flash Of The Blade&quot;, which is horrendously overrated.

B00004Z459|5.0|As some might know, the band was called Hybrid Theory before their commercial breakthrough, and that name gives you a hint of what this band is like. <BR>No, this band is not Heavy Metal. A lot of people are busy complaining that the guys are a disgrace to Heavy Metal, but really, they are not a Heavy band. They use some metal elements (very well, I might add), along with rap and electronica, which is why some like to label them as Nu-metal. This label might be the most accurate, but their sound is unlike most other Nu-metal bands.<BR>They have a knack of creating very catchy songs, which, of course, explains their commercial success. <BR>More, they really are a bunch of talented artists. Chester sings really well, both aggressive and emotional, even though his voice is a bit untraditional and maybe boyish, but he does it well, and it adds to their distinctive sound. <BR>Mike raps with routine, and complements Chester well, while Brad and Phoenix on guitar and bass does the groundwork in most songs, even if they don't give off any flashy solos. Rob is, in my opinion, one of the best drummers out there, and Joe Hahn - well he is on of the elements that adds to LP's distinctive sound. LP wouldn't be the same without his intelligent understanding of scratching and electronica. <BR>The lyrics are well written and the band keep them universal, so they are easy for everyone to relate to. <BR>Some are annoyed by their heavy use of angsty lyrics, and most of them are about alienation, and yes, they may not be very original, but still well written. <BR>Hybrid Theory is one of the few albums in my personal collection where I can listen to all songs at all times without skipping any of them.
B0001DI5W6|4.0|well if you like bullets,lasers and explosions,this one is for you.problem is,thats it too.the world is free of humans.the computers have designed thier own world and only a few master hackers realize this.they are the black guy from thejedi council in the new star wars movies,ted from bill and ted and the crippled guy from oz.in the first one,they train ted to do all the state of the art,over the top awesome moves he does.it is truly breathtaking to behold!theres plenty of action!in reloaded they go deeper into the computers program to figure out how to beat it.theres a 12 minute long car chase scene that is the most excellent car chase scene of all time!theres also a lot of that crazy -spacey-gravity defying-kung fu stuff that they do.in revolutions they  go to the central core of whats holding the computer world together and rage war on it.then these millions and millions of robotic squid things come out.theres a big bunch of shooting and boom boom boom.the end.its too violent for kids i think.it seems as though they spent so much money on the squids,.in part 3 only,they forgot a storyline or anything else that goes with a movie.just boom boom boom.outof the 3,it basicly just wraps the first two up.in the first 2,there were stories,chicks,plots,scenes,and places.this had a dark place filled with squids.of the 3,this one is a distant 3rd.if you like sci fi and action youll love all 3 of them for they set the abselute standard for our time as far as sci fi goes.the first time this happened was in the late 60s when 2001:a space odyssey made all others before it obselete.than no one could touch it until star wars in the late 70s.the next batch to take over was the terminater series.now its the matrix trilogy.in part 3,.this one black chick does some awesome pilot work in one of the movies most exiting parts.the hype was better than the movie actualy turned out to be.not to discredit it though as an excellent movie.hollywood tries to advertise every movie as exiting as armageddon but fails a lot.this is keeono.uuuuhhhhhhh.....teds third best movie ever.ill give you one guess what the other two are.the trilogy ends here.it is a bit long,but good.
B0001LJC2K|1.0|when you try and turn radiohead into shallow, easy listening rock-pop, it becomes muse.  It sounds like radiohead but has lost the experimental, ground breaking quality radiohead has.   <br />So if you like cathy pop music on MTV you will like this album.  But, if you like listening to revolutionary, dark, experimental music, just listen to radiohead.
B000096IB6|4.0|lets get its flaws out of the way first.its not necessary to show a small boy being blinded,screaming in agony at the hospital and the like.what is it with movie makers and graphic portrayels of kids suffering?damn!would you all stop it already.the whole daredevil comic was also summed up in one movie.it has been out a long time.some of daredevils stunts all over the rooftops were hardly belivable,especialy for a blind man.and lastly,that the kingpin is a gigantic,fat white guy not a pretty big,thick,black man.are we color blind?does it just not matter what a guys color is?i bet you a lot of people would get mad if a movie got made about oprah with rosanne playing her or one about martin king with danny devto cast as the doc.now the cat woman is black too.this is stupid.can eveyone just stay the right color please?in this one a kid gets blinded .his other senses get bettter,but his take off to super extraordinary levels.he becomes the daredevil.lawyer by day,masked vigilante by night.well,the kingpin whos now a homeboy crimeboss.since were on the subject,crimeBOSSES,are almost always white.the thugs are black.check your statistics!but,anyway the kingpin is getting pod that his men keep getting wasted.yes,they are white.so,he gets this crazy irish guy called bulleseye to kill him.bulleseye has a few powers of his own.1-anything whatsoever he picks up,he can use lethaly.2-he never misses-except in this movie when hes fighting the daredevil,3-his bones are laced like wolverines with admantium.im betting they didnt use that in the movie either.ben affleck plays daredevil.it is the best ben affleck movie ever! i like jay and silent bob strikes back better.but he was in that for only a few minutes and whined like a littlke girl the whole time.youre the parent you make the call with this one.i couldnt really say.it is one of the better comic book films lately.if you liked them,youll like this one too.elektra is a long time rival of daredevils in the comic book but here shes his girlfriend and she is HOT!!!!!!!!!too bad she never goes full frontal.hype says its not that good.the real deal is its better than the average comic flick.the action is awesome.there is a fight between dd and everyone i named.will there be a sequel?if you watched the credits,and lets be honest,nobody does,you ll see bullseye all muffed up in a hospital bed.now this did happen...........wait a minute!no it didnt!daredevil had a building fall on him from bulleseye.nevermind!its a good movie.the creators just had a hard time seeing to make it with thier heads so far up thuer asses.maybe thats why its about a blind guy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Not just pasting in deleted scenes, this version was assenmbled from scratch with additional material that add to the depth of this movie.  THIS is the version to buy for watching at home.
B00000JGEI|5.0|in this sequel to the awesome original,arnold is a good guy sent back to protect john conner.another newer model of terminater comes after them.this t-1000 is made from quasi-liquid metal.it can be solid or liquid as needed.johns mom sarah decides to go and waste the dude who found the original terminaters hand and was largely responsible for the eventual takeover by the machines.this is a bit much for smaller kids.the action is incredible in this one.the first part was a indt film.this one cost 80 million dollars and made 78 million in its first weekend.it is the best of the 3 id say.if you are squeamish,you might want to go see bambi instead.belive it or not,its even emotional in a spot or 2.sara isnt a tenny bopper in this one but a dykey rambo bitch.her shrink isnt around long,but while he is,he is very obnoxious.of course he lived.it seems the guy in any movie who really needs killed,never gets it.sara deserved an award for this one.she did an awesome job playing a psycho with a lot on her mind.the message is no fate but what we make.in part 3 youll see that just isnt true,but i alredy knew that.intensity galore!sara plays a very intense character.all the action,the nukes,it freakin rocks!this is arnolds best!the special effects kick ass too.they made a 3rd.im hoping for a 4th also.but since it takes 10 years for another sequel,id better not hold my breath.and,by the way,who cares if arnolds to old.cant they find another musclehead to play some sort of new   terminater?its do-able.we know it.hollywood knows it.so get off your lazy asses and make it already.i belive its about time for the big showdown between machine and man.
B00024BHTC|5.0|In any age when MTV and Radio have nothing but crap music it is good to know there is a band out there that puts out good music. I used to think bands like Slipknot, Korn, and Limp Bizkit were what metal was all about. I used to think that good singers where people liek Britney Spears, and that Hiliery Duff. Then I found Nightwish. I foudn a band that was real Metal. I foudn a band that had a realy singer. I found music that was well music. <br />I hear it all the time here and in other places. They are not on MTV, they are not in the top 40 of music. I also hear stuff such as teens will only like this. Sorry but teens like Britney Spears and Limp Bizkit. They don't like Nightwish. <br />I also like bands like Within Temptation, After Forever,and Epica  <br />But to not sound just like them Nightwish keeps changeing. Epica sounds like Nightwish in some ways. So I'm glad Nightwish is doing something to not sound like other bands with a Female singer. What they had with OB was new. What they have with Once is different and sets them apart from other bands such as Epica and After Forever. Same thing with bands such as Tristania and Sirenia. <br />Also one last thing I would ask those who are new to Nightwish and got OB first to listen to all of there stuff starting with AFF. You will find that Tarja gets better in better at singing. AFF was good but OB was better. OB was good but WM was another step up for her. Then comes CC it is even better then WM. Know you have Once. She is able to sing in many other ways besides just her OB voice. A true singer can use many different ways of singing. Everything from opera to none opera all the way to something you have never heard of before.
B00000JGEH|4.0|this movie goes down in history as one of only 4 standard setting sci fi  films.the 1st in 68 with 2001 a space odyssey,then in the 70s with the star wars group.then there was the ter,minater team.the only real flaw with this set is that the sequels are so far apart.its awful.i argued for years that a sequel was feesible.it was almost 10 years before the 80 million dollar sequel showed.these are wsay too good too let sit like that.i heard that arnold only has like 16 lines in the whole movie.story is this,there is this chick who mothers a boy who grows up to be the guy who saves the human race from extinction in the future.the machines send back arnold swarzanega[man,whatever]who is a cyborg to kill her before she concieves.however,the humans had stolen some of the time displacement equipment and sent back a soldier to protect her.as you can guess,a lot of people get wasted.id wait until the kids were about 12 for this one.it started out as a indy film and then hit big.there are three parts.this one,the second one with the gelatonaus terminater and the 3rd one with terrible acting but ovet the top action and effects.this is the least greatest of the three but is still awesome.it is a bit much for the squaemish.there is the mom,sara conner,in this story as a 80s style single from the punky brewster era.she gets busy with the soldier boy.you know making plastic explosives and the like.arnold gives one of his best performances even though he doesnt say much.the important message is:do not trust machines!this movie is intense!this is arnolds third best movie.after,of course the other two terminater films.the future?well,maybe by 2015 well have a 4th one and by 2040 #5 will finaly show.anyhow,id love to see one where all this stuff they keep talking about goes down with the machines trying to exterminATE the humans and the war and all.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|I just recently got the privelege to hear this astounding band live in Kansas City. I'll tell you, they are great. With songs like &quot;Just Friends&quot; and &quot;I Don't wanna be&quot;, Gavin makes it easy for anyone to relate to his music. If anyone has ever had a relationship, friends, or just lived in general, this CD is sure to relate to you.
B00008F21S|5.0|there have been 4 movies that blew all other sci fi movies away and set the standard for new omes.this one was the second one to do so.the story here is that the rebel alliance had a message transmission going out.the empire picked up on it and overtook the ship it came from.before they could be found out,they jettisoned 2 droids out in hopes of survival.some desert people sold the droids to lukes uncle.luke accidentaly found the message.it was a chick trying to find o.b.won ken o.b.[i know i know]he found him and ben took him along to adventure.luke ends up in the rebel alliance flying a starship.the kids will enjoy it as it is full of giant teddy bears,fantastic laser light demonstrations and exitement.george lucas made this film.it rules!did he ever do a non-star wars related movie?this is the 1st of a big set.the best set anywhere with 6 soon to be 7 awesome episodes.this movie is for everybody.theres one slimy part where theyre trapped in a garbage disposal.leia is the only chick about and she kisses her brother!thats some sick sh........stuff.of course she didnt know but still.oooohhh!the special effects were top of the line in 77.theyre still cool now.this movie is one the all time greatest contributions to film ever!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'd rank this movie right up the with the best of the slasher films. It is The Texas Chainsaw massacre or Faces of Death 5 of our generation. Just when you thought horrible fanatical death was only the perveiw of the cable news networks Mel Gibson gave us this gem of a gorefest. If you like blood, flaying, misplaced entrails and seeing a man brutally murdered this is the movie for you. Like other movies in it's genre it has no redeeming qualities but unmitigated brutality all there for you to see. What more could you ask from a movie. Now that we have this on DVD we can all sit back and enjoy the ride at home. Grab a 6-pack, a pack of smokes and turn on the surround sound and let every bone crunch and death scream remind you that movie greatness still exists in the new millenium.
630575067X|5.0|in this one,there is a council of jedis who rule everything and keep the peace.yoda,ben,some black dude and on like that.a younger ben finds a little kid-who is called anakan and later vadar.that kid wins his freedom with bens help in a very cool pod race.ben recognizes the force in the little one and decides to train him as a jedi.the bad guy is darth maul who has a double bladed light saber-very cool.hes the coolest  looking character yet.i think peple came down too hard on jar-jar.hes a dork but there have been a lot worse.the kids will like it.it is the 4th part but the first episode.everybody should go see this one because just anybody will like it.anakans mom was pretty nice if she cleaned herself up.this movie isnt as good as the tv says but they blow everything all out of proportion anyway.this movie is abselutely incredible though.i think the black dude may be in the matrix too.its good too.the special effects are good.after this there is one more.then there is an animated short film.there is also another one on the way next summer.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|this CD is good...i definatly like her 1st CD better...it was more more lyricly inclined. The lyrics on this CD are good but its like shes run out of ideas...and the sound of her vocals and music is waay to poppy! <br />Its still a good CD, not even close to hard core punk, but it could satisfy any pop, pop/punk, punk, alternative listener.
B00005ATQC|5.0|another gem in the bracelet that is the stanley kubrik discography.this was his 13th film.3 bad things happened.one-it was his last film because 2-he died and 3-nicole kidman and tom cruise[the stars] divorced shortly thereafter.anyhow,tom and nicole are hitched.they dont spend much time together and thier marriage is on the rocks.tom is given someone elses invitation to a very sexual and wierd party.thats when everything begins to unravel.this has way too many female parts in it for the kiddos.this movie is a psycological thriller.i was very involved in it.any guy whose staight will like it.at the party i was as confused as a baby in a topless club.it is also very emotional for the chicks if thet can get past seeing thier own parts.chicks are so silly about stuff like that!this is tom and nicoles best movie ever.hands down.bar  none.it is very long but worth every second.
B000066NW0|4.0|this is an amazing break thru CD! i enjoyed the lyrics and music very much! the lyrics Avril wrote seem like they are written for a lot of teens, this is because shes still a teen, so she basically goes thru some of the same things a lot of teens today go thru, and putting all of those emotions into music makes for a great time! some of the constant screaming on the album gets old, but its over powered by everything else...im not saying this is the best alt/punk/pop CD ever, but its really good...
B0000CDL3W|5.0|in part 3 here,sara conner is dead.john conner is in his early 20s and keeping his self impossible to trace.they send this extremely  sexy terminater chick to kill his officers since he cant be located.arnold must protect john and this other chick who is an officer later on.they call her a captain.a cap is by no means 2nd in charge like they say in the movie.that would be a general.arnold shows again in another excellent performance in the terminater movies.i dont know who that sexy chick terminater is but damn is she fine!john,however,is really ugly and nasty.his officer,the chick is pretty but an uptight bitch.its kind of violent for children.this is as youve read already the third part to this fantastic series.the bad terminter chick has many neat powers like dna testing,talking to other machines,mimicking dial up tones,controllling other machines etc.there are a few more.its the second best of the 3 .any terminater fan will love it.only like squeamish and non-intellectual sell out julia roberts types will not like this.but screw them anyway.no fate but what we make does not carry over to this one.this is arnolds second best.the special effects are cool.the action is great.im still waiting on a 4th part with the man vs machine war.
B00005RFAI|4.0|i love this CD. I bought it mainly for Just Like A Pill and found that most of the songs on her appeal to me. The beats and sounds of this make for great party music. <br />i dont get why she's classified as a pop artist tho...some of the music sounds poppy, but not completely...shes more alt/punk or pop/punk...<br />good CD....that wraps it up
B00004XOWM|3.0|This CD is alright, but Significant Other was way better. Wes Borland was kind of right, LB did become a \\"sellout band\\" in a way. On this CD you can sense them trying to make an easy buck off of some of the songs, and most of the lyrics are downright horrible and laughable, its mostly about Fred Durst not wanting anybody to p*** him off, or him bragging about how Limp Bizkit has the \\"hot s***\\". Still, LB are a good band, and this is way better than that overrated, overproduced, formula-based Linkin Park crap.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I love anything punk or alternative, and i live for this CD! It's on of my favourite CDs from any artist. The lyrics and music are amazing and its definatly, in my opinon, the best CD that they've put out. Even if you dont agree that it's their best, you have to admit that its a great CD and even tho its only like 35 minutes, for those 35 minutes you can lose yourself in some truly amazing music!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time and the AFI top 100 movies of all time refuses to acknowledge it. Al Pacino deserved an oscar for his portrayal of Tony Montana, the movie deserved an oscar for something yet this movie is constantly overlooked by all critics, but the cult following that it has amassed is by far more telling of it's popularity than sheer box office numbers. ask anyone on the street and they'll tell you Scarface is one of the best movies ever made, and if they don't think so they haven't seen it. So sit back, crack some hennessy and alize, light up a cigar, and enjoy one of the best movies ever made!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|A separated 'sort of' boyfriend and 'sort of' girlfriend become all and everything to each other while struggling their way through the devastations of the Civil War.  Inman (Jude Law) is a poor carpenter in a small North Carolina mountain town who has a strong mutual attraction to a 'better class' girl named Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman).  Social status dictates and the proper decorum of the day prevent them from plunging forth in the direction their hearts want to go, but when Inman leaves for war, they lay bare their passion and agree to correspond during his absence's duration.  <br />Upon her father's death, Ada finds herself alone and penniless in the world, and unable to manage her large farm on her own.  In a letter, she asks Inman to return to her, and he, no longer able to tolerate the depressing daily horrors of war, obligingly abandons his post to tramp home on foot.  Now a deserter, he is hunted by the law and encounters obstacle after obstacle on his journey toward his 'ain true love'.  Back at the farm, a no-nonsense, take-charge young woman, Ruby (Renee Zellweger), has appeared, and is as determined to build helpless Ada up from being a self-sorrowful belle into a self-sufficient survivor as she is to save the farm from ruin with hard work.  Ruby becomes Ada's bonded friend and essential helper, while Ada and Inman become each other's goal to live and strive for.<br />The cast does a flawless job with their roles and the costumes, location shots, and music are all top quality.  Phillip Seymour Hoffmann proves yet again that he's the greatest character actor of modern times.  He's always brilliantly playing somewhat unsavory fellows with mental issues.  And Charlie Hunnam, usually G.Q.-style gorgeous, usually a 'good guy' onscreen, so efficiently turned himself into one of Cold Mountain's most sinister creeps, I didn't even recognize it was him until the ending credits!<br />This movie reminds me of a contemporary version of 'Gone With the Wind', much more raw and real, and without the soap operatic flourishes.  Those with intellectual minds, sentimental streaks, or both, shall not be disappointed.
B000268QB2|5.0|This CD is totally amazing. This guys falsetto voice is incredible and the songs are addicting. My favorite one is She Has No Time. If you like Coldplay, I think you'll love this!
055357342X|5.0|I finished reading book 3 in April and I'm sitting here typing out my review and I still get chills JUST THINKING ABOUT what has happened in this book, the previous books and the future books to come.  Book 3 continues on where book 2 left off.<br />The character development is amazing.  As others said, the beginning is a tad bit slow, but once you get through it, its a roller coaster ride up to the top and you're left weightless at the climax with disbelief.  Actually, I should say climaxes - because each thread ends in its own shocking way - especially Tyrion's.<br />Another example of his mastery of character development is the Jaime story line.  I used to *hate* Jaime and now I understand his point of view and I've come to love him.  I was always excited to see a Jaime chapter.  Hell, I was happy to see ANY chapter because each one snowballed into the next.<br />This is hands down the best lit. series I've ever read.  You wont regret reading it.  I somehow managed to read through the first 3 books in 3 months while going to school full time and working full time.  Yes, it is that engrossing.
B000286SCO|5.0|This is the second DVD I have bought from Dream Theater, the first being Live Scenes from New York.  Although the sound quality might be superior in LSFNY, the quality of the content in this 2 DVD package is just too good for any Dream Theater fan to pass up (especially at this low price).  I loved to see the music videos that were never aired... and the commentary is hilarious!  Dream Theater puts on a better live show than anyone, and this DVD is very high quality.  I can't wait for the new Budokan DVD. :)
B00003CXUM|5.0|'In the Mood for Love' is a touching, engrossing meditation on, you guessed it, love: what it is, what creates it, what ends it, what keeps it sewn strong together. All of these aspects are collected into a clever, lovely, sometimes devastating piece of artistry directed by the fabulous Wong-Kar Wai. Those of you who love romantic comedies or grand, epic love sagas will be immensely disappointed with his latest film. It is not either. Rather, it is a gem of cinema that strives for emotional truth and absolute realism. Inside of cramped apartments and old diners, that, too, is what the main characters of 'In the Mood for Love' yearn for. <br />The film takes place in Hong Kong during the year 1962. Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) have just moved into neighboring apartments and have met each other rather casually. But the two progressively realize a secret about their respective spouses and a profound relationship develops almost instantly. From there, the film sets a tone that is cislunar, seeming to float in its own world situated between reality and a sense of disconnection. Kar-Wai perfectly evokes this mood with fleeting slow-motion sequences accompanied by Christopher Doyle and Mark Li Ping-bin's delicately visceral cinematography. What ensues throughout the rest of the film (both plot-wise and technically) masterfully conveys romantic yearning. <br />The lead performances were breathtaking, namely Maggie Cheung as Su Li-zhen. From scenes of obvious hurt to moments of hidden despair, she ceaselessly astonishes. I'm surprised she did not receive the massive encomium she deserved from 2001 year-end awards groups, let alone the Oscars. But credit must also be given to Tony Leung as Chow Mo-wan, who managed to maintain a quiet, tired loneliness throughout the film. Leung also understood that it was only with Su Li-zhen that Chow Mo-wan felt truly alive with passion.<br />Another character worth mentioning are the breath-taking sets by production designer William Chang Suk-ping. The claustrophobic atmosphere offered by Suk-ping's dated, tight hallways was as much a part of the emotion and story line as each lead. Collectively, each part of the movie-making process (screenwriting, directing, designing, acting) achieved an assured concinnity; and in the end, what was already a personal, accessible study is lifted by Kar-Wai to a universal level using epic shots of Mayan temples and mysterious landscapes. As the credits role, it becomes apparent that 'In the Mood for Love' is arguably a masterpiece worthy of the all-time lists. <br />For me personally, the constant flashbacks of wind sifting past vinaceous curtains and artful conversations about love at its core only underscore 'Love's greatness. It is an unforgettably personal journey not to be missed.
0345440900|1.0|This book is aweful. So many reasons why..... <br />Control and training are not something you need to do to your child. Children have needs and if you meet those needs when they need them, then they will give it back to you later. <br />Don't buy this book. You don't need someone to tell you how to raise your own child. Follow your instincts!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Either she got a vocal coach and learned how to sing better or she uses better equitment but either way this cd, Under My Skin, is very good.<br />It has everything from ballads to punk songs about not having sex.<br />Avril has a knack for writing lyrics.
0316168815|5.0|Although somewhat morbid in that it is about ghosts and rapists, it was overall a great read.  It's what most people want - to be given the chance to communicate with, or watch over, your family and friends after you die.  I loved the book, couldn't put it down...it's a must read.
0767840135|1.0|I am a dedicated Cirque fan, experiancing the delights of O, Alegria, Varekai, and Dralion. I recently saw Quidam on TV and was extremely disappointed that I sat and wasted 3 hours of my life in front of the TV for that. This annoying little girl never quits singing, and nothing very entertaining happens through the entire performance. If you want to become a huge Cirque Du Soleil fan, my advice is to not watch this one first, because it will spoil it for you. The best would be to go and see O (or Mystere) live in Las Vegas before anything.
B00000I8UD|3.0|So far, my experience with David Sylvian's music had been 100% satisfying: having heard some of his work with Japan and his outstanding 'Secrets of the Beehive', I figured that this album would be just as good. Well, I was wrong. In spite of some great musical moments (such as the opening &quot;I Surrender&quot;) this album doesn't get to the level that 'Secrets...' does. It ocasionally departs from that 'mystical' musical path where Sylvian is so good at, to explore other forms, or maybe it is that so far I still cannot get over the change, but I wouldn't recommended for those uninitiated to Sylvian's work.
630024797X|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but the movie wouldn't let me.  Sorry to disagree with everyone, but this movie is a real stinker.  I gave it 2 stars for the music and the cinematography.  To call this movie slow is the understatement of the year ... it moves like a sedated tortoise.  I really can't understand those people who say that this is the best film they have ever seen ... they can't have seen many films.  I have been watching films seriously for about 30 years, and have seen many great ones ... but this ain't one of them.<br />&quot;Okay, wise guy, you didn't like it. Why?&quot;  First of all, let me say that the first part, when the main character interacts with his brother, brother's wife, and his kid (who has been raised by his brother), is far better than the end, when he and his son search for his wife.  They find her in Houston by waiting outside a bank and following her car (why not try the phone book first?). Then, unexplainably, Travis leaves the kid with her while he takes off again (going to Paris, Texas?  Does he intend to come back?).  This, after spending much time re-establishing a relationship with his boy.  I'm not one that demands happy endings, but I do like endings that make some sort of sense.  I hear that much of the ending was unscripted, and it shows.<br />Dramas require tension, whether between characters or in the plot (&quot;don't ever open the green door!&quot;).  This movie has none, which is a primary reason why it is so terminally dull.  Travis (Stanton) is a complex character, but is never fully revealed, and although we may feel sorry for him and his condition, he remains simply a screwed up individual.<br />Dramas also require some kind of contrast.  There is very little of that in the film in any respect.<br />Great dramas usually have great dialogue.  Don't look for any memorable dialogue here.  I don't expect Shakespeare, but the totally mundane, inane dialogue in this picture does not serve it well.  Shepherd couldhave done better. And the director must have been watching too many Antonioni films, with all the pauses and lacunae.<br />Acting?  Stockwell, as usual, does a good job.  Stanton is mute for much of the first part of the film.  When he does finally talk, his lines are delivered in a monotone that could put anyone to sleep.  Kinski, Travis' wife, is gorgeous, but doesn't have much of a role. <br />I recently viewed &quot;Scarecrow&quot; with Gene Hackman and Al Pacino.  This is a truly fine drama.  &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; could have been a very good drama, but it would have taken a lot of tinkering.
B000053VAZ|5.0|This film features Johnny Depp as Sam a quirky off beat character who moves in with brother and sister,  Benny and Joon (played by Aiden Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson) after Benny loses at a card game.<br />Benny takes care of his ill, troubled sister and initially is grateful to have Sam there to help care for her, especially as Sam seems to understand Joon and brings laughter into their home. As Sam and Joon's relationship starts to deepen into love however Benny protective instincts kick in and he becomes hostile and angry.<br />Very strong acting from all the leads stop this film from becoming too schmaltzy. The result is a beautiful film, which has a perfect balance of humour and pathos. Highly recommended
B00009XITP|4.0|If you're looking for a quality movie for people of all ages, stop now. But, if you're looking for some family-friendly fun, you've come to the right place.<BR>  \\"What A Girl Wants\\" focuses on the life of quirky NYC teenager Daphne, played by Amanda Bynes. Her job as a waitress at weddings (with her mother alongside her, playing in a wedding band) has left her longing to meet her father, whom she knows very little about. Daphne looks him up on the net and flies to England to meet him, but is distressed to discover that he knows nothing about her and has his own busy life. While trying to find out about her father, though, Daphne discovers she has a lot to learn about herself.<BR>  In short, the movie is good, clean fun. It's cute, but pointless. Fans of Bynes are guarenteed to fall in love with the film, as will pre-teen girls. They're also likely to fall for Oliver James, who is very studly as Daphne's love interest; but, if he's not your type, Colin Firth as Daphne's caring-but-emotionally-confused father is dashing, as always. Bynes does a great job, too, adding comedy to this sticky-sweet film and keeping it from being tooo melodramatic and soap opera-ish.<BR>   Overall, \\"What A Girl Wants\\" delivers. That is, if  you're looking for a popcorn-and-gummy-bears-slumber-party-chick-flick.
B00000K3D4|5.0|On its release this little gem of a film was overlooked and was not the hit it deserved to be. Sarah (a young Jennifer Connolly) is a teenager with her head in the clouds, living in a fantasyland of knights in armour, goblins and fairy tales. She greatly resents her stepmother and her baby half-brother Toby. Whilst babysitting one night she gets frustrated with the constantly crying baby and wishes he would be taken away by goblins. To her horror the goblins oblige and Toby is whisked away to the castle of the goblin king (played surprisingly well by David Bowie).<br />Sarah has to journey through the labyrinth of the king in order to rescue him. Along the way she is befriended by a variety of strange and wonderful beings who accompany her on her way; Hoggle the grumpy dwarf, Ludo the hairy giant with a gentle soul and Sir Didymuss, a terrier type 'knight' with an Old English Sheepdog for a steed. The labyrinth twists and changes as the Goblin King tries to thwart Sarah's quest.<br />Jim Henson's workshop has worked its usual magic and produced puppets that have character and appeal to young and old alike. The film is littered with songs that are written by and performed by David Bowie. This film is pure magic that will entertain any age group.
B000002UB3|5.0|As the sixties came to a close,it was only fitting that the beatles were on top of the charts with abbey road.Reports are that this was there all time biggest seller,and I'm not surprised at all.
B000059TEP|4.0|Ghost is a film that essentially covers the theme of life after death and is about Sam (Patrick Swayze), his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore) and their lives after Sam is murdered. Sam's spirit tries to contact Molly and reassure her he is all right but Molly has no belief in the afterlife. As far as she is concerned Sam is dead. When Sam realises who is behind his death his concern for Molly grows and he becomes desperate to get through to her. By chance he comes across Oda Mae, a charlatan medium who is as shocked as Sam is when she realises in fact she can hear him and she does have psychic abilities.<br /><br />Whoopie Goldberg is the real scene-stealer as the reluctant medium trying to convince a sceptical Molly that Sam is still `alive'. She manages to inject real humour into the role, which stops the film becoming too morose. Her reaction when she realises she is really psychic and is not just a fake conning bereaved people is hilarious.<br /><br />This is a real tearjerker of a film, a box of tissues to hand is a must, but it is a film that is well worth watching.
B00005V9HA|3.0|How they took HP Lovecraft's short story (which is one of the SCARIEST short stories ever written, in my opinion)and came up with this, I'll never know, but there's no denying the entertainment value.<br />This has some outrageous scenes, like the decapitated head performing  cunnilingus on a woman strapped to a table, and the exploding eyes, and the re-animated cat. It is easy to see why this has such a huge, loyal cult following.<br />Now to be fair, what I'm about to say has not been mentioned by the other 106 reviewers, leading me to believe that this only occured with my copy, but I was not able to move the arrow on the main menu, so I missed out on the extra features. Like I said, I proably recieved a defective copy, but it may be wise to investigate before purchase.
B00005JLRT|4.0|This final outing of the 'next generation' crew is one of the better films in the franchise but not the best.<br />On the plus side it offers some excellent action scenes and SFX and we finally get to see the enigmatic Remans who are being led by a clone of Picard. A lot of the story threads that have continued throughout the T.V. series and prior films are also tied up, such as Deanna and Will Riker finally marrying, Riker getting a command etc.<br />However, the film is not perfect. Data discovers a 'brother' on another planet but there is no indication of why/how he get there and this thread is never fully explored. Picard's clone seems obsessed with Deanna at one point...why??<br />This film works on a pure entertainment level but don't expect any complexity in it. It is like a marshmallow...a lot of bulk but not a lot of substance.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Although this 5 time Academy Award winning film certainly gets a beautiful presentation on disc, I both do and do not understand the complaining of the DVD presentation of Schindler's List. But first, let me discuss the benefits of the disc first.<br />The picture here is impressive, although there are noticeable flaws. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture showcases excellent detail and rich black levels; at times the picture looked so good I thought that the movie was remastered by Lowery Digital Services. But then minor flaws show up, such as excessive grain and minor print flaws (such as in the sequence where Schindler Jews are calling out their names, I spotted a vertical line). Flaws aside, the picture is still beautiful and Janusz Kaminski's photography is put to good use here.<br />The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 Surround. All Dolby and DTS tracks give a sense of place to the film, and while the tracks aren't bass-heavy, they fit the movie's tone perfectly. It demonstrates excellent stereo separation and bass response, all the while not calling attention to itself. The two-sided disc cuts down on cost, and the menus allow one to access each part of the DVD with considerable ease. (The movie is also given French and Spanish spoken languages and subtitles, while the extras have optional subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.) <br />Now, the disadvantages. I know people were expecting an extras-packed version of this movie, but we only have two real extras included; the \\"Voices From the List\\" Featurette and \\"Behind the Shoah Visual Foundation\\" Featurette. Both are good extras detailing the various stories recounted by actual Schindler Jews, and while these are substantial enough, I had the feeling more could've been added. If Spielberg were to do commentaries, I would appreciate one done for this film, and the addition of the theatrical trailer would help too. Inclusion of those two extras would've added much more to the DVD.<br />Still, quibble about the extras aside, the disc release of this film gives newcomers a chance to be introduced to one of Spielberg's greatest cinematic achievements ever made, with great picture and sound. It may not always be easy viewing, but the impact it leaves is indelible and unforgettable. For fans of Spielberg's work and this movie, this disc is a must-have, despite the slim extras. (If you're intent on having more, the gift set is a viable option. Along with the DVD, it also includes a booklet, the movie's soundtrack CD, certificate of authenticity, a photo still book and a Plexiglas keep case.)
B000002UA5|5.0|Ummagumma features a live album and a studio recording. They are both excellent. The live recording features 'Astronomy Domine', 'Careful With That Axe Eugene', 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun and 'A Saucerful of Secrets' all of which can be found on previous albums. The live rendition however is certainly better than the recorded versions of these songs.<br />The Studio album is quirky to say the least.... the track 'Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict' says it all! It is a cacophony of sounds that on first listening is bizarre and makes you wonder if Floyd were on acid when they performed it. It does, however, grow on you and does fit in well with the rest of the album. 'The Grand Viziers Garden Party' is well worth a listen as is 'Sysphus' but, by far and away the best track, is 'Granchester Meadows'. This beautifully harmonised piece is an indication of the brilliance to follow with 'Dark Side of the Moon'.<br />This album will probably appeal more to the die-hard fan of Floyd rather than the casual listener but for that die-hard fan it is well worth the money.
B000002MZ6|2.0|Is he trying to become Brian Eno or what? If it's space music you want, stick to &quot;Apolo - Atmospheres &amp; Soundtracks&quot; and you'll be fine. This stuff sounds pompous, self-righteous and grandiose, but the musicwriting is ridiculously weak. The vocal samples, the &quot;hi-tech&quot; synths and effects are all gimmicks, throw there to conceal the absolute lack of melodies and musical ideas. Really, it tries to show more than it has. It's a void, insubstantial piece of fluff. And Mike's guitar playing sounds uninspired and dull, as if he's absolutely sure that everything and anything he plays will necessarily be utter genius. I've never heard such a disappointing album in my life. If he wanted to create atmospheres, he should go back and listen to Hergest Ridge, not the latest Enigma albums and try to do a cheap copy.
B000068R1X|5.0|Bark at the Moon was the first studio album that Ozzy released following the death of the great Rhandy Roads.Bark at the Moon features Jake e Lee on guitar and Tommy Aldrige(Black Oak Arkansas) on the drums.The title track Bark at the Moon is a classic with a great riff.The keyboards have quite a presence on some of the songs, which isn't to bad.Other great songs are the ballad So Tired, and Slow Down, and Waiting for Darkness. The whole album is great, one of my favorite Ozzy albums.
B00000DATR|1.0|&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; no longer means a timeless, groundbreaking masterpiece. &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; now is a brand, because Mike himself sounds convinced that anything that begins with a tinkly piano line and ends with the sound of bells instantly is &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (check The Millennium Bell). As such, what once was a powerful name is banalised, brutalised and beaten to a pulp, because Tubular Bells III is nothing short of godawful. It looks like he forgot to write melodies for his album, so all he does to fill up time is let his synthesizers bleep around and create a bunch of derivative &quot;dance&quot; riffs (The Source Of Secrets, Secrets), play something on his guitar that he has played MANY times before in the past (Outcast, Serpent Dream), or worse, indulge in an embarrassing, derivative &quot;melody&quot; (The Inner Child, Top Of The Morning). Practically everything he does here, he has done before. Man In The Rain not only directly copies Moonlight Shadow, but rips-off the intro for Rush's Time Stand Still (remember that one?) with its &quot;beautiful&quot; guitar sound. But the worst blow is that Mike plays every note as if he was playing Beethoven's 9th Symphony. Everything is pompous and self-important to a sickening degree, and the majestic finale of Far Above The Clouds features (sampled!) tubular bells playing nothing at all. It is a disgusting album, no more, no less, not worthy of attention at all. Stick to Amarok and the original Tubular Bells and you'll hear everything Tubular Bells III is supposed to be, but isn't.
B000063DGC|5.0|Released five years after Randy Rhoads death, Tribute is a live document from Ozzy's 1981 tour. The band plays a great show, with 8 of the 9 Blizzard of Oz tunes making the album, and a couple from Diary of a Madman, and a couple of Black Sabbath numbers as well. This is one of Ozzy's best lineup's featuring Rhoads, Tommy Aldrige(Black Oak Arkansas), and Rudy Sarzo(Quiet Riot.If you can't get enough of Rhoads, or if you just really enjoyed Blizzard of Ozz you'll love this album. The 1995 CD version has a couple of flaws, the intro is cut out, and the space between the songs is messed up to cutting out the dialog, while they're saying it.
B00005JNA2|5.0|Maybe because I am the same age as Ethan Hawke, I could really relate to Before Sunrise when it came out in 1995. I was hopeful when I heard there was finally a true sequel (not counting the Jesse/Celine segment from Linklater's Waking Life) coming out. Well, just as I could relate to the conversations in Before Sunrise, Before Sunset offers up a whole slew of new topics for us 34 year olds to relate to. Amazing. I am now married with 1 child. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) brought up some things in this film that really hit home. Richard Linklater is a true master at conversation. Unlike Kevin Smith, who writes great dialogue that sounds very unnatural, Linklater's conversations are 100% real. It also helps that Delpy & Hawke have a real love of these characters (Jesse & Celine). Anyone who dismisses this movie as \\"boring\\" or self-indulgent is someone I would not want to associate with personally. It is a beautiful work of art. We need more films like this.
B000000OSE|5.0|With the real follow up to Appetite for Destruction, GnR stretches the formula out a bit. There are a lot of great rockers like the opener &quot;Right Next Door to Hell&quot;,ballads like &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;November Rain&quot;, with the later being different than their previous ballads and longer than must of the other tracks being about 9 minutes. There is also a cover of Wings &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Use Your Illusion 1 is an excellent follow up to the classic &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;.Axl and the boys open up their hard rock formula a bit, and try some different styles.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album has got to be the best I have ever heard.  There are no tracks on this album that should be skipped.  I have listened to a lot of albums over the last couple years and nothing comes close to this.  I would have to say that Big L - Lifestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous, Jay-Z - Reasonable Doubt, Tupac - All Eyez On Me, and Notorious B.I.G. - Ready To Die come close to this album but none of them are better.  Nas' story telling ability alone sets him apart from other rappers.  When he raps you almost feel that you are a part of what he is spitting.  Also, he almost always has a positive message in his songs and to me that counts for a lot.  Now-a-days almost every rapper out there is rapping about cars, money and girls just to sell records but it seems that Nas doesn't care about how much he sells he just wants to put out music that almost all people can relate to.  Make sure you pick up Street Disciple when it hits the stores September 24/04.....ONE LOVE
B000000OSG|5.0|Use Your Illusion II, continues the experments and open formula of Use Your Illusion I.Some of Axl's best singing and writing is on display here.&quot;Civil War&quot;,14 Years,Yesterdays,and a cover of Knocking on Heaven's Door, make for a killer first half of the album. There is also an alternate take of Don't Cry, as well as a goofy attack on some of the critics that gave Axl bad reviews, &quot;Get in the Ring&quot;.

B00007LTIA|5.0|I found this album very enjoyable right after the first listening. I recommend it to anyone. <BR>The songs are long, but I really don't care. They're just darn good. T&amp;TO is just like a good wine.<BR>Perhaps this is not an album which you can listen to five or ten minutes. If you like good books, you cannot read them for ten minutes, or 10 pages per a day! You must listen to the whole album per each listening, and then that's better.
B00009V7OL|5.0|The Abyss is by far one of the best alien encounter movies in the last 15 years.  But I'm glad Cameron left the original ending out of the final movie. <br /> <br />Some of the extra footage is great, but the ending they left on the cutting room floor should have stayed there.
0553573403|5.0|My husband, an avid fantasy reader, has tried for years to get me interested in the genre.  One evening when I was desperate for something to read, he handed me this book and begged me to give it a chance.  I was hooked from page one!  The writing is exceptional, and the characters--especially the women--are well developed.  What strikes me most about Martin's work is that it is brutally honest and the characters act and think like real people...they don't seem at all like the stereotypical &quot;heroes&quot; I've encountered in other books.  One word of caution to those who don't read a lot of fantasy, be sure to give yourself a few chapters to get into this book.  Until I figured out how this world worked I found myself confused a lot, and I kept having to ask my husband to clarify certain points.  Once I &quot;got it&quot; though, I had no trouble reading. This book (and entire series) is so amazing it transcends genre and can appeal to any reader.
B00008WG3U|3.0|There are quite a few tracks that just never grow on you but the ones that are good are pretty damn good...
B000268QB2|4.0|...just listen. Keane are very good at what they're doing. If you've heard their singles and liked them, the album will not disappoint you.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is the kind of fantasy book that glues your hands to the book.  It draws you in further and further as the plot undergoes bumps, surprises, and spectacular twists.  At times it can cause chills to run up your spine.<br />  It's about an 18 year old girl who is just graduating college, but she's far from normal.  She dwells in the dark and dangerous art of necromancy.  Her family line is one known as the Abhorsens, who unlike most necromancers, who raise the dead, put those that should not walk in life, back to death.  When her father  doesn't show up for his monthly visit, Sabriel gets a disturbing message from a dead servant, telling her that his life is in danger, as he is trapped in the dark depths of death, itself.  Sabriel ventures into the mystifying and dangerous Old Kingdom, where she grew up when she was little, in search of her father.  Sabriel learns along the way a disterbing amount of information about necromancy, charter magic, and the dark world known as the Old Kindom.<br />  Sabriel finds more then she ever thought she would while journying through the Old Kingdom, including deep love, dark magic, and an unspeakable evil.
B000002MTR|2.0|Despite constant member changes the Peppers have proved to be one of the most reliable groups around and they seem to reveal more and more talent in their writing as years go by . Their last couple of albums were simply amazing and &quot; Blood Sugar ... &quot; remains one of those great rock albums music lovers never get tired of . If there's a low point in their career then &quot; One Hot Minute &quot; must be it . Only the first single &quot; Friends &quot; is worthy of your time or money . &quot; Aeroplane &quot; is cathcy but forgetable , &quot; Wrapped &quot; a noisy mess of some sort , &quot; Pea &quot;  more of a joke than a song , &quot; Falling Into Grace &quot; is rather cool yet they can do so much better . This is a band that has released some of the most rich , high quality modern music albums of the last decade only &quot; One Hot Minute &quot; is not one of them .
B0002NRRUQ|5.0|What can you give to some one who likes Classical and at the Same time heavy metal music? Solution: Metallica S&M. This DVD features one of the most notorious heavy metal Band known to America accompanied with one of the best organizations of all: The San Francisco Symphony. It is to no surprise that after viewing this videos or listening to the CDs much of the heavy metal fans opened their taste for classical music and the same goes for the classical music fans towards heavy metal. Three of the most awesome features of this DVD are the composition Ectasy of Gold by Ennio Morricone, wich it has been heard on Clint Eastwood's \\"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\\". Also the display for the song \\"One\\" Wich had a mayor impact of the view on the military; And last but not least the best feature ever is the release of the song \\"No Leaf Clover\\". This Song has a mayor view on hardship and the short rewards of Life. Overall this Volume of the carrer of Metallica will have a long and steady hold for years to come. I rate this product a ten but unfortunatedly there is only a max of five
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|No film I've seen since Barbara Streisand's \\"Prince of Tides\\" was less worthy of its Academy Award nominations than this turkey. And no film I've ever seen was less deserving of the awards it won. Aside from an average story and murky Boston location shots, there was little else good to say about this film, whose principal theme was eerily familiar to another bad movie, \\"Ghost Story\\".<br /><br />The acting, in particular, was poor. Had Marcia Gay Harden not portrayed an interesting, multidimensional character, there'd have been nothing good to say about any of them.<br /><br />Sean Penn played the same role he has played since \\"Falcon and the Snowman\\" and \\"Bad Boys\\" -- the brooding, insolent killer with bad judgment -- yet somehow won an Academy Award for this image. This says more about the Motion Picture Academy and its processes than about this film, which is full of bad acting and direction.<br /><br />Sadly, Penn's lack of subtlety was only the beginning of the mess. Tim Robbins, who also won an Academy Award as a pitiful victim, was so miscast as a Boston resident it was laughable. The direction given Robbins, Penn, Lawrence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon -- especially in the use of their Boston accents -- was stilted and resulted in unbelievable characterizations.<br /><br />Boston lifers must have laughed out loud listening to these dimbulbs try to speak Beantownese. No one could be expected to suspend disbelief to that extent!<br /><br />The fault for this overacting, bad langauge and one-dimensional acting belongs to director Clint Eastwood, a Hollywood insider on scale with \\"Pretty Woman\\" Julie Roberts and California Gov. Arnold \\"Terminator\\" Schwarzenegger. Had a lesser director or an independent like Spike Lee or John Favreau done this, no Hollywood entity would have rushed forward to reward their effort with awards.<br /><br />It's great to be Clint Eastwood, I guess. He could at least have used his influence to bring a language coach to the set. One of the elements that makes \\"The Sopranos\\" the best program in television history is its language coaching, especially the on-set coach for star James Gandolfini. Even with that, this film would still have been average but would have been more believable had a coach instructed these dummies in the proper use of Boston English. Hell, they even did that with the Louisiana Cajuns in \\"Southern Comfort\\"!<br /><br />Among the movie's other vagueries was the telephone relationship with Bacon's ex-wife. It put a smile on Bacon's face after two hours but played no role in the film. More important, it did nothing to dispel the memory of Bacon competing with Gregory Peck's portrayal of Captain Ahab as the most wooden acting job in Hollywood history. Perhaps Medusa was on the set and turned him to stone for two hours, only to relent once he made up with the wife?<br /><br />It has been written that the average films that win Academy Awards have the largest advertisinig and promotional budgets and the greatest influence by Hollywood insiders. \\"Mystic River\\" is the case study in this postulate, winning several awards and being nominated for many others when it was, in fact, deserving of none.ram in television history is its language coaching, especially the on-set coach for star James Gandolfini.

B000002GK1|5.0|i bought this CD long before i even owned a CD player
B000009ROK|5.0|the music is great however it came with a package and the case was broken and it was not taken care off.<BR>I was dissapointed about the manner in wich it was shipped.<BR>Just thought I would let you guys know to becareful next time you send something.
0767817664|5.0|this is no doubt the best horror during the eighties. i watch quite a lot of horror movies due to the fact that they are my favourite kind of movie. Although i watch horror movies they never seem to scare me but &quot;fright night&quot; has been the 1 and onli that has scared me. It is a brilliant film to watch. Hope u have the same pleasure as i did
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This is one hilarous movie! My dad always used to tell me how good it was and how he watched it when he was in college, but I never believed him. When I got a DVD player as a gift from my boyfriend my freshman year of college, it was one of the first movies that I purchased. It is so funny and it's a great movie to watch with your friends while you're relaxing and having a few beers! I think that everyone who has ever experienced college parties should be buying this movie because you probably never experienced a party like the guys on Animal House throw! Enjoy!!
B00005JKN9|3.0|Martin Scorcese's epic tale of gang warfare in New York at the time of the Civil War is an overblown, exaggerated account that is very watchable but ultimately fails as a cohesive story.  I don't doubt that much of what happens in this film is inspired by fact, but I don't think that the actual participants looked quite as much like the cast of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; as do the characters in this film.  Take, for example, the main villain, William Cutting AKA Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis).  One of his eyes is a steel ball with an American eagle on it; he cut out the original to present as a gift to the man who gave him a magnificent beating.  There's also a woman who has filed her teeth into fangs.  And a guy whose club is notched to commemorate his victims.  Star Leonardo DiCaprio's father (Liam Neeson) wore a priest's collar even as he marched into battle.<br />I have come to expect gritty realism from Scorcese, but in this film he goes way over the top.  The enormous (and surprisingly well-lit) catacombs and cavernous interiors with ratty characters hanging from bamboo scaffolding seem like left-over shots from &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;.  It often seems like a film made by a much less skillful director who is willing to sacrifice the reality of his scenario for a cool effect, a bit of dramatic posing, or some easy violence.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Robert Wise made his masterpiece with this film mixing the essential spirit of the shakesperian mood , recreating it in the modern times as a racial conflict.<br />Wise mixed the drama with a credible plot . The coreography is towering and the music ( Oh what kind of inspiration was in the mind of Leonard Bernstein , acquire buy also the soundtrack; Maria became a classic ), Rita Moreno won a deserved Academy Award and this became a personal triumph for Natalie Wood one of the most beautiful faces ever seen in the cinema story .<br />The sequence fights between the bunchs is perfect articulated , there is a fine balance between drama and music.<br />Enjoyable film and of course for all a generation of teenagers in that age , who actaully are grandparents , still remember with nosthalgie that unforgettable jewel picture .
B000008GHW|5.0|Buy this album for the song &quot;Drifting&quot; which a friend put on a compilation for me once. Its definately one of my favourite Hendrix songs along with &quot;1984&quot;, but it has the greatest lyrics ever written-<br />&quot;Drifting on a sea of forgotten teardrops, on a lifeboat, sailing for you love, sailing home&quot;.<br />As a musician you can only admire that kind of imagery. I'll give it 5 stars because of that song and because Ezy Rider is superb too. I havent heard the rest of the album, I probably should buy it.
B00006ADFL|4.0|While I watch alot of muder,mystery and suspence movies. This movie was an insight to two girls who murder. This true story is simply disturbing. Kate Winslet plays Juliet Hulme. Juliet and Pauline are selfish and cruel to think of only themselves and kill for the two girls to be together. Did anyone know that Juliet Hulme changed her name to Anne Perry? Name sound a little familiar? Well thats because Anne Perry is a murder mystery writer. What a way to channel thoughts of murder!!! Write about it and make lots of money. I guess since she couldnt just keep killing people for real. She decided to write about instead. Hey Anne, your one sick puppy!!!!!!
B000002AVF|5.0|I have always and ever shall be a BIG fan of the diva named Ms. Mariah Carey. I own 3 of her CD's namely &quot;#1's&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, and of course, &quot;Daydream&quot;. Why am I saying that Daydream is the BEST album that she ever recorded? Due to the fact that the songs in this album are all HITS and there were some #1's in this album here like the songs &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, &quot;Always be my Baby&quot;, and &quot;Fantasy&quot;. There are also top 40 hits like the songs &quot;Open Arms&quot;, &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot;, and &quot;Forever&quot;. See that almost all of her songs in this album reached the hits destinction. That's quite a feat, right? I didn't have any second thoughts in buying this CD, because I knew then that this album will become her BEST among the rest of her albums. I always adored her music, because she can sing in such a very melodious way that will even make my hair stand at attention everytime she gives us that very high-pitched climactic note. Just like on her duet with Whitney Houston for the soundtrack of the animated feature film,&quot;Prince of Egypt&quot;, the song &quot;When You Believe&quot;, wherein she did one of her hair-raising high-pitched note for the word &quot;believe&quot; in the ending of the said song. WOW! That really sent my soul to another dimension! No other artist has ever made my hair stand stiff due to their voice. Only Ms. Carey did and I salute you for your masterpiece of an album which is the BEST Mariah Carey album to date &quot;DAYDREAM&quot;. All hail the eternal diva, Ms. Mariah Carey!
B000003TA4|5.0|well, depending on what u grew up with all changes the aspect of what you like...so all opinions are welcomed, but in my opinion nirvana has qualities that some bands could only dream to master, instand fame, and kurt's ability to write lyrics, just listen to what he has to say before you criticize his voice, everyone is born with a different vocal talent.  And then there's my man Dave Grohl on drums where he belongs, not on guitar with the foo fighters, anyways, nirvana had the attitude needed for this decade and if not for them...music today would not be the same, you can't deny it...
B00009MGQL|5.0|Buy this CD.  Play it loud enough.  Your children will hear it and leave you alone for a while. They will also think twice before crossing you.  Of course if they surprise you and end up liking it - you still end up with a great Jeff Beck album. Score one for family values. 'Nuff said.
B00005JMYG|5.0|this movie was hilarious!  i was continuously laughing so hard i nearly wet my pants....even if you don't like will ferrell, SEE THIS MOVIE! it's worth it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is by far Britney's best to date.  Everytime is a beautiful song, and her latest single Outrageous is an awsome song with a great dance beat.  I can't wait for her Greatest Hits album which will have new material to come out this November.  Go Britney!
038073186X|4.0|Just read this book.  I picked it up at the airport.  I've never read any of Mr. Lehane's other books.  I COULD NOT STOP READING IT.  I read it on the plane from Vancouver to Los Angeles.  I read it until I couldn't see anymore.  What else do you WANT from a book for God's sake?  It's FABULOUS.  It breaks your heart and pulls you in and makes you THINK.  It's just good writing and there is no substitute for that.
B00008MZ0N|1.0|I hate this movie. Do not buy or rent.
0441003257|4.0|Think Monty Python meets Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide.  Throw in a bit of Dogma (the Kevin Smith film), and you have this book.  If you like all three of these, you'll probably enjoy Good Omens. It helps to have a basic understanding of Biblical prophecy and a bit of appreciation for British humor.  Without these, you might get a bit lost.  <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book is that I had a hard time figuring out where it was going a lot of the time.  It felt like there were a lot of unnecessary scenes.  I kept waiting and waiting for the Apocalypse to come around, but it seemed to take forever.  <br />Still, it was worth reading.  I laughed outloud at several of the jokes, and the two main characters--the representitves from heaven and hell pictured on the cover were hysterical.  It's worth the seven dollars just for them.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|In which Nicole Kidman defends her home against cartoon villains and Renee &quot;Look at me, I'm ACTING&quot; Zelwegger's performance, while Jude Law wanders the wilderness and meets eccentric people (including an old woman who bears a suspicious resemblance to Clint Eastwood in drag).<br />During the way, the movie pauses to explicitly note that one of the reasons Nicole is struggling so to keep the old homestead running is that she SET HER SLAVES FREE as soon as her Daddy the preacherman died (and of course the script never refers to them as &quot;slaves&quot;, but as &quot;negroes&quot; or &quot;coloreds&quot;), because of course she is a GOOD Confederate, you can't have your major motion picture stars whipping the darkies behind the barn, now can you?
B000000WA2|4.0|If \\"Parklife\\" celebrated the working class, \\"The Great Escape\\" is the polar opposite; a bleak outlook on white collar life. Nonetheless, the music is very upbeat and catchy (for the most part).    \\"Country House\\" is so catchy and fun that it borders on novelty song territory. \\"Charmless Man\\" contains, arguably, Blur's catchiest hook to date. \\"It Could Be You\\", \\"Stereotypes\\", and \\"Dan Abnormal\\" are among other catchy pop/rockers on here.    The dreamy \\"Fade Away\\" uses an ugly main chord progression, yet you'd never know it. And \\"The Universal\\" is a majestic slice of Burt Bacharach-like chamber pop.     \\"Mr. Robinson's Quango\\" combines a tradional bouncy Blur beat with seductive saxophone breaks. And \\"Ernold Same\\" is a weird spoken word piece set to a harpsichord, strings, horns, etc. It sounds like a druggy Brian Wilson experiment..really cool, actually.    A couple lowlights towards the end. \\"Globe Alone\\" is annoying punk. And \\"Entertain Me\\" is a shameless retread of \\"Girls & Boys\\".     The album closes on a great note with the Japanese electro-pop ballad \\"Yuko & Hiro\\". It's very bittersweet and beautiful.     Other highlights include the melancholy \\"Best Days\\", and the downbeat, hypnotic \\"He Thought of Cars\\".    Blur really did hit a dead end with this album. The songs are great, but their sound was entering self-parody territory at times. Luckily, they were smart enough to realize that, and radically changed their sound on the next album.     Best Songs: Yuko & Hiro, The Universal, Mr. Robinson's Quango, He Thought Of Cars, Fade Away.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Wow, I don't think I have ever seen a better depiction of crap than in this film. The only thing redeeming is that Ben Affleck was in it...on second thought, there was nothing redeeming about it. And coporations wonder why people download movies instead of going and paying for them. In film (as it is in music) if your product is not worth paying for, people will download it. This film is one of many examples where the dobly 5.1 and HD quality picture makes no difference. Wanna see this film? Get it from Kazza
B000001ESN|2.0|I have been a major Rush fan since I started High School. After all these years I'm still a fan of their older stuff through the eighties. <BR>Permanent Waves was a decent album, but it started, unfortunately for me, an ATHEIST trend that Neil Peart got on. The song &quot;Free Will&quot; is not simply about freedom of choice, but the lyrics take the time to call believing in God &quot;fantom fears&quot; and &quot;kindness that can kill&quot; and describes a believer in God as a simpleton with little brain power who believes in this grand puppeteer pulling his pathetic strings and doing what he pleases with us without our questioning, etc.<BR>I took exception to that song. <BR>I noticed that he brings back an atheist twinge on the album &quot;Roll The Bones&quot; singing about how could a kind God allow global poverty and famine, etc. that the only reason we're here on earth is because we're here. That doesn't make much sense. &quot;Why are we here? Because we're here, roll the bones...&quot; But both albums play to a cynical tone of pessimism. The Roll The Bones album is very much about chance and that nothing happens for a reason, especially on the song &quot;Ghost of a Chance,&quot; there is no fate or destiny, just happenstance. <BR>Neil Peart was a brilliant writer and I just loved his songs until the time when he seemed to get into the cynical pessimism and antagonistic atheism of Permanent Waves.<BR>Natural Science, Entre Nous, Spirit of RAdio, all great tunes! I absolutely LOVE 2112, Farewell to Kings, Moving Pictures, and the rest....I think Rush is one of, if not the greatest, next to the group &quot;Yes&quot; progressive rock bands ever.<BR>As a Roman Catholic who DEEPLY believes in Christ, I was saddened to see Rush alienate believers like me who also happen to be Rush fans. <BR>As a result, I'm only a fan of their old stuff.<BR>I've seen them live in concert but I'm not the fan I used to be and honestly don't care much about them anymore because their lyrics don't fit me since Permanent Waves.<BR>Christians beware of some of the course Rush went on....
B00005JMYG|1.0|How can you people rate this movie anything but bad bad bad!!!  There's NO plot!!!  Terrible waste of film.  Boring and waste of time.  There's no humor in it.  If you really think this is funny ... you must lead a rather shallow life.  Don't waste your money seeing this movie.
B0001WTUH6|1.0|And I'll say it again:<br />What a STUPID movie!<br />At first it looks rather good when you look at the dvdbox. You would expect something like Batman mixed with the Matrix. But it's not! The storyline is horrible, everything rolls out of the closet, storyelements are taken for granted, and don't get me started about the actors and especially actresses.... what a bunch of losers! Where did they get them!? A mental institution?<BR>The only good parts are the settings and some of the special effects, for the rest I would say.....<br />TO BE MAKING FUN OF THIS MOVIE IS LIKE POOPING ON POOP!
037571457X|5.0|&quot;Persepolis&quot; marks the third book in the almighty triumvirate of great autobiographical graphic novels that examine injustice. Joining the ranks of &quot;Maus&quot; by Art Spiegelman and &quot;Palestine&quot; by Joe Sacco, &quot;Persepolis&quot; has garnered a remarkable amount of attention. Positive attention, that is. Suddenly it's getting high marks in everything from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; to &quot;VOYA: Voice of Youth Advocates&quot;. I wonder to myself whether or not author/artist Marjane Satrapi has been surprised by the mounds of attention. I also wonder how it is that she was able to take her own life story and weave it seamlessly with the history of her own country, Iran. This book is like an illustrated version of &quot;Midnight's Children&quot;, but far darker and far more real.<br /><br />The first image in &quot;Persepolis&quot; is the same image you see on its cover. Marjane sits wearing a veil in 1980 for the first time. As the story continues, Marjane explains her own beginnings as well as the beginning of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. In her own life, Marjane was an only child of middle class intellectual parents. She experienced the usual childhood ups and downs. Sometimes she believed she was God's next chosen prophet. Other times she wanted to demonstrate with her parents in the street against the Shah. Over the course of her childhood Marjane learns more about the limits of class in Iran as well as the secrets behind her family history. She finds that her grandfather was a prince, her uncle a political prisoner for years, and her parents far braver than she ever expected. Marjane deals with the danger of challenging authority under the rule of religious extremists while growing up as a normal girl. By the end, her parents determine that the only thing left to do is to send their only daughter to Vienna and Marjane must face a future without them by her side.<br /><br />Before I read the book I scanned the illustrations and found them lacking. I thought (originally) that they were too simplistic to effectively convey a deep plot and deeper discussion of the human propensity for violence (and good). After reading the first page I discovered that this assumption, while normally correct, was wrongdy wrong wrong wrong. Yes, it's certainly true that Satrapi's style is simple. At the same time, it's also the ideal companion to the piece. In a book such as this you do not want to draw attention away from the narrative voice with inappropriately overdone illustrations. As for the writing itself, it's engaging to even the most reluctant reader. And what better way to teach people a little Iranian history? Quite frankly, I was baffled by some of the things I discovered here. I consider myself a lightly educated middle class individual. I know a little more world history than joe schmoe down the street, but not much more. Nonetheless, after reading roughly five pages of &quot;Persepolis&quot; I discovered, to my chagrin, that I know jack squat about Iran. Were you aware that Iranians are not, in fact, Arabs? How about the roots of the Cultural Revolution? How much do you know about that? Or the day to day routines of people living in Iran in the 1980s? No?<br /><br />Today we the American people live in a country where our rulers like to bandy about phrases like, &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, and condemn entire countries with a single blow. What &quot;Persepolis&quot; does so (apparently) effortlessly is to put a human face on inhuman suffering. Iranians have been through more horrors than can be recounted in a single book. I think what struck me the hardest about this story was the little things. The stories about girls in school skipping class to flirt with boys. Discussions with other kids about farting from kidney beans. Punk rock and Michael Jackson. All this took the book from being a personal voice of a nation's struggle to the point where your average reader identified deeply with the characters. The final image in this book is heart breaking. I only hope I have the guts to get &quot;Persepolis 2&quot; and read it cover to cover.. The final image in this book is heart breaking.

B000001IQH|4.0|this is a good album for youger people just getting into rancid.<BR>when i got this album i listened to it so many times and i didnt get sick of it like i normally would. It is melodic and has  good choruses.there is some great bass playing also. best songs are junkie man  back to olympia and journey  to the end.
B000001FFR|5.0|Spreading the Disease is where Anthrax went their own way with their own music. In 1985 you had plenty of bands playing your run of the mill Thrash, but Anthrax personalized Thrash in a whole new way.<br />The overall production is dry. But the album amazingly doesn't suffer one bit from that small detail. This is Anthrax's second singer as well. If you compare Belladonna and Turbin, you can see why the former got the job. (Turbin's good...in his own way.) Belladonna doesn't have a super high voice (like Turbin) but his occasional wail is well placed...he sounds like he's having fun.<br />The speed and tempos showcased here are very diverse -you have slow songs (&quot;Madhouse&quot; and &quot;Medusa&quot;) and pedal to the metal songs (&quot;Gung-Ho&quot; and &quot;Aftershock&quot;). The guitar work is incredibly tight but experimental and varied with some of the best solos Thrash metal has to offer. Spitz and Ian make a good duo. The bass lines stand out in the parts where it matters and are pretty creative and time-varied. While Charlie Benante's drumming became better in later albums, the drumming here is still better than about 80 percent of the small time Thrash bands at the time. Not an excessive amount of double-bass on the album but it is well positioned where used.<br />I don't have a favorite Anthrax album, I have two. But this is no lesser an album than &quot;Among the Living&quot; the other #1. This is classic and no Thrash catalog (or even Metal catalogue) can be without this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like many fans, I completely missed this series when it aired.  I'm  certain that word of mouth will boost sales of the DVD set far beyond expectations.  The characters are three dimensional, quirky and likeable.  Current sci-fi shows like Enterprise or Andromeda constantly leave you wondering why you should care about the characters.  Firefly's pilot episode, &quot;Serenity&quot;, ensnared me with  wounded Kaylee, disturbed River and what's with Captain Malcolm and the companion Inara?  It's worth watching.  I only wish there were 6 or 7 seasons worth.
B000001FTD|5.0|What more can you say about this album? It's a little faster than their (1985) &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; [the other #1] album and the production is far better.<br />I don't think there is one bad song here. There are of course some that aren't as good as others...but you know you have a good album when the first four songs could easily be put on a &quot;best of&quot; album.<br />The guitar work is as tight as it gets. The Spitz/Ian duo creates some great main riffs and solos that aren't typical Thrash displays. They work hard and it shows. The bass work is great (even solos) at certain junctures (like &quot;Skeleton in the Closet&quot;). The drumming is interesting, Benante is a good drummer but I think his energy exceeds his ability sometimes. Nevertheless the typical Thrash fan will like the blast beats and double-bass parts like in the title track and &quot;Skeleton&quot; tracks. He also uses &quot;explosion&quot; beats a little too much. The best drum parts are on &quot;I am the Law&quot; where the time change ups are pretty cool and the main drum part is kinda funky (but in a Thrashy way). <br />The vocals really can't be described because Belladonna certainly has his own voice. I mean it's not like the other high-pitched Bruce Dickinson ripoffs out there at the time but it isn't like the Dave Mustaine growl either. <br />Favorites for me are the title track, &quot;Caught in a Mosh&quot;, and of course &quot;I am the Law&quot;. Anyone with even a casual interest in Thrash Metal (1981-1994) should own this album.
B000002KMV|4.0|to think that this album appeared back in 1981 and we are still talking about it. That's a real testament about this huy's work. This is what today's people are attempting to sound like but never will. In a world that can be rather unflinching and colorless Prince's Controversy put a little fucion unto the landscape then. The album that would come before 1999 has so much to offer than just great songs. In a blink it could be easy to miss out on its gems such as Do Me Baby and Let's Work. Do Me Baby is the first and perhaps the only ballad that really elevates the music with it's careful orchestration and simple piano. This song just invites for an evening of champagne and candles. It's edited version need not apply since Prince always makes the album cut so much more interesting. There is so much layering and additional stuff. Don't miss out on the title cut which at this point Prince was mastering. His next few albums would open with more specialized title cuts (i.e. 1999, Around the World In A Day, and Purple Rain)enough to make your mouth water. The dance beats on this album are just so conatgious for your soul and feet. Try keeping from dancing to Let's Work, laugh silly to Jack u Off. The last two cuts in this album are bit confusing in that Annie Christian is a little dated. Ronald Reagan and John Lennon? And Ronnie Talk to Russia. That does not matter it is good to the last drop!
038533348X|5.0|This early classic was one of the books that made Vonnegut famous, and probably the first book where he really found successfully his particular style of black comedy.  (He aimed for something similar in Sirens of Titan, but that book, with some fine moments, is uneven and significantly less successful.)<br />The first persom narrator is known only as Jonah, although his first sentence is the allusive, \\"Call me Ishmael.\\"  He is writing a book about the atomic bomb that leads him to research on the late Dr Felix Hoenneker, a brilliant scientist who viewed science with pure curiosity.  Never caring about the practical implications of his work, Hoenneker made no distinction between working on the atom bomb and investigating how turtles retract their heads.<br />Seeking to learn more about Hoenneker from his surviving children, Jonah follows them to the impoverished island nation of San Lorenzo, loosely based on Haiti.  There he is introduced to Bokononism, the dominant religion of the island which, among its many unusual features, openly proclaims that it is a fraud.  A good part of this rather short novel is a detailed discussion of Bokononism, which is  one of Vonnegut's most memorable creations.<br />While on the island, Jonah also learns more about ice 9, the final project that Hoenneker worked on.  Ice 9 is ice with an entirely different crystalline structure from regular ice, which has the trait of freezing at normal temperatures.  Thus, if you mixed ice 9 with any body of water, it would promptly freeze.  Jonah soon finds reasons to doubt his assumption that ice 9 could not really exist.<br />Jonah's adventures come to a grim if strangely appropriate finale - I don't think Vonnegut has ever written a novel with a happy ending. The moral of the story is, it seems, that life is entirely without meaning or purpose.  And yet, the humor and vitality of the novel give it an energy and even joy strangely at contrast with its depressing message.
630512065X|5.0|&quot;Mungojerrie and Rumpletezzer have a very strange way of working together and some of time you would say it was luck! and some of the time you would say it was weather&quot;<br />&quot;Macavity , Macavity theres not one like Macavity there never was a cat of such deceitfullness and suavity he always has an alabi or one or two to spare at what ever time the dead took place Macavity wasnt there&quot;<br />These are only two of the great songs in the show! it is really really good; great songs, funny, good acting, good dancin!<BR>all around excellent!
B000003TA4|5.0|this album is by far the best album of the 90's! anyone who doesn't have dis album has 2 get it. with a song like, smells like teen spirit, who could go wrong? everytime i listen to this album, it just blows me away. Kurt is the ultimate, and if u dont have dis album, u r totally missin out! get it! it rox!
0441009425|1.0|This is appallingly written. Some gems:<br />&quot;Fire burned in their minds too, but this was the unquenchable fire of being.&quot;<br />&quot;'Assassination tools!' Girardieu shouted.&quot;<br />&quot;Volyova digested this knowledge for a few moments before regurgitating it as a tiny, troublesome cud of certainty.&quot;<br />Quite hilarious, really; perhaps the whole thing is tongue-in-cheek? Such depths could only be reached intentionally.
1400034779|2.0|I wanted to read this book because of the positive reviews it had received. The book was hard for me to get into. I wanted the mystery to present itself sooner than it did. Too much time was spent on the main character's history, which I suppose was to set up the series. When she finally got a case, it was resolved very quickly. I realized that this book would describe several simple, quick cases she had worked on rather than having a main mystery that would serve as a plot. It was interesting to have Africa as a backdrop, but that is not enough to make me want to read other books in this series, the first book of which disappointed me.
B00005JKGV|2.0|Whereas I appreciated the abstract, progressive filmmaking of \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" this movie was so abstract that it took the jump from progressive to ambaguous (yes, that's a word).  In fact, I discovered, upon viewing this film, that it is actually possible to spontaneously combust from confusion.  To make things worse, I made the mistake of taking a lovely young lady on a first date to see this movie (needless to say, we didn't date very long after that).  Patricia Arquette's well-proportioned jumblies are the only two things I found remotely fascinating about this turd.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Imagine if the ending to the Sixth Sense was only on DVD, and there was a friendly Hollywood ending released in theatres.<br />I decided to watch the Director's Cut first when I got the DVD. I was intrigued from the start of this horribly tragic story. Evan leads a devastating childhood, always managing to end up in traumatic situations, from a very young age to his young adulthood. One really feels for him in his attempts to alter his situation; however, the result is always something just as horrible or worse.<BR>  Some of his attempts to change his childhood make more sense than others; one could leave it to that his mind is becoming more and more irrational, that he will attempt things that may not necessarily be beneficial to him. As the film builds up, one begins to wonder, what is the solution to this poor, seemingly cursed boy's problem? The Director's Cut ending is a harrowing, shocking ending that gives me chills to think about. Watching the theatrical release AFTER you watch the Director's cut is not nearly as powerful.<BR>  I think if the Director's Cut had been released in theatres, critics would have looked at this film much differently.
B000003S0D|5.0|this is my favorite king crimson album.it is consistantly powerful all the way through.each song has a corresponding portrait on the front cover.has anyone noticed the song &quot;happy family&quot; being about the beatles?(see top right picture on cover)......jon anderson of yes has never sounded better,and the drumming is superb.many bands have worn the label &quot;prog rock&quot;,but dare i say robert fripp may have invented it.....
0380002930|5.0|I first experienced the amazing lapine world in Watership Down at the age of 7 when my mother read it aloud to me.  I was absolutely entranced by the different characters, the epic feel of the journey (which would seem as mere miles and months to humans), and the deeply entrenched mythos that tells the rabbits their place in the world.<br />If you enjoy the deep world and characters of Tolkien, you will find this book to be endearing and riveting.  This novel is not just for children or for high school English; it is for everyone and is an experience to share with the ones you love.
B000001IQH|1.0|this cd is so awsome i almost crap my pants i think about listening to it!!!!!!1 when listen to it i feel more sex than before. i want rancid to make 4 or 5 more cds that sound just like it!!!!!11
B0001UL7RY|1.0|i think that people who call themselves punks and then deny it is not cool because that makes people wounder when you are telling them the truith or not and so you would not really be trusted.  as far as her music goes,  most of her songs are crap.  they are not even how should i put this... they dont sound good at all and if you see her live and she is not liping to background lyrics then you would obviousely not like her and not want to go to anymore avril concerts and not buy anymore of her cds. trust me.  her music is for little kids because once you reach highschool you finally reolize that she is a fake and makes crappy music.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's such a shame when a band as great as Muse fails to captivate a complete audience, sure these days mainstream music in America has gotten slightly better with the advent of bands like Modest Mouse, PJ Harvey, Death Cab for Cutie, Coheed and Cambria and The Shins crossing over onto the air waves...maybe just maybe we'll see the demise of coporate-sewage, though it will take some time. <br /> Anyways back on subject, Muse first album to fall onto the U.S. shores since 'Showbiz', not to say that 'Orgin of Symmetry' was a bad album, because it still stands the test of time, it just wasn't well received. The opener starts off much like Pink Floyds' &quot;The Wall&quot;, as soldiers march across giving a hint of the post-apolayptic mayhem that stretches across this albums' borders. &quot;Apocalypse Please&quot; comes marching in with frigtening pianos as Matthew Bellamy echoes off into the distance, this is the end of the world...and he sure makes a good convincing claim it is. &quot;Time is Running Out&quot; is the bands first official single in the states, it's catchy but in no way loses it's focus on being a tighty-pieced together song. &quot;Sing for Absolution&quot; is quite the doozey, a trance ambience fills the backdrop as a choir play host to another desperate cry from Bellamy, all leading to a perfected piano closure. I can go on and on about every track, since they all bring something valuable to the album's overally sheath, but I'll spare thee the time.<br /> I'm lost for words here, very few modern bands have the overall ability to pull an audience right in, these guys can do it. They're talented, got showmanship and have been making a wave wherever they've gone. I didn't get to see them at Coachella, the only place in recent memory I can think of where they played in America; a friend told me they were amazing...as equally awesome as the Pixies and Flaming Lips which is saying a lot.
0440416027|3.0|I recommend Skellig for 10-14 years old boys and girls. If you like mysteries and like to be left hanging, this is definitely a book to read! I liked this book because of the weird things that happened. There are some things that leave you wondering. At one point in the book the old man says, \\"27 and 53\\" and you might think it doesn't have to do with anything, but it appears throughout the whole book. Mike's friend says to him, \\"What's wrong with you?\\" That leaves you hanging because by this point you're so into the book, you want to know what happened.  Even though it's not one of those really important parts but it's a mystery that the author throws in to keep you wondering. But in the end you finally find the answer to all the mystery's and the problems. That was why I liked this book because at first I was confused but in the end it all came together.
B00023BM20|1.0|WARNING! Don't believe the hype. This movie is boring as HELL! Absolutely nothing happened. Come on, I wasted my time trying to avoid falling asleep hoping that something interesting would happen, or that there will be a major turning point soon. I got NOTHING! Anthony Hopkins is really a black man...PUHLEEZE I THINK NOT! Get real, that was so unrealistic and unbelievable. Maybe, if it were somebody/anybody else besides Anthony Hopkins I could buy that, but not him. What was Nicole Kidman thinking? There is way too much star power in this movie for it to be as bad as it is. I don't know or see what a lot of other viewers saw, but apparently based on the overwhelming response of positive reviews a lot of people like it. I find that shocking, but I guess to each it's own. I've seen my fair share of movies, and I have a pretty open mind, but I didn't like this one at all. Frankly, I have seen some of the worst movies imaginable, but this one, I must say was one of the worst movies I've even witnessed.
0780020685|5.0|A reviewer once wrote that the most amazing thing about Seven Samurai is that one-and-a-half hours into the movie, we're still in the character development part, and nobody's even noticed the movie has been running that long already.  sure, it's not for everybody, especially for those who grew up with mostly Hollywood commercial fare that last 70-90 minutes.  but for even the borderline film enthusiast, the Seven Samurai is a treat.  Here, some of Japanese cinema's greats (Kurosawa, Mifune, Takashi Shimura) come together at the perfect time, to do the perfect job.  Here, possibly, is the greatest movie of all time, and you are watching it.<br />the best special feature, the commentary track, is very detailed, in fact at some point, it is annoyingly too detailed! but if you want to know why toshiro mifune's acting was over the top, or where he was born (Manchuria), or why millet seems so low compared to rice, or why the light seems to change during the scene where we first see Kanbei Ishima (the bald, dignified leader of the samurai, here portrayed by Takashi Shimura), then the commentary track is indispensable.  I've seen this DVD twice, with commentary on, and with commentary off.  It's quite easy for me since I don't understand Japanese anyway, so the dialogue comes to me strictly through subtitles.  needless to say, I highly recommend watching it in the manner I described.<br />there have been many &quot;tributes&quot; to this movie, from the obvious (The Magnificent Seven, The 13th Warrior), to the not so obvious (Disney/Pixar's &quot;Bug's Life&quot;).  In all of them, the idea that a band of warriors would come to the rescue of an obscure village for nothing more than a bowl of rice (what, not even meat to go with that?), or in the case of &quot;Bug's Life&quot; nothing more than the chance to finally give a good show, seems ridiculous and unbelievable.  As many reviewers have posted, the wretched farmers don't even deserve sympathy.  Until you realize (the commentary helps a lot on this) that these samurai agreed to take the job because it gives them a chance to do what they do.  They went there because once again, they can prove themselves worthy.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil is a highly underrated group.  They aren't given the credit they deserve.  This album is a must-have for any fan of Evanescence.  The sound is very similar, but Cristina has her own vocal quality different from Amy Lee's of Evanescence.  If you're looking for the sound of Evanescence with a touch of a stronger grunge sound, this is the album to purchase!  This album contains a great variety of music!
B0001XWV0S|3.0|This film surprised me. I thought it was a remake of Harvard Lampoon's European Vacation (which was awful). I might read in to much, but I thought it was reasonably clever and funny. Four stereotype Americans go to Europe to find the the German girl one of them is in love with. Over there they run in to English soccer hooligans (Vinnie Jones in good form), Italian bisexuals, and so on. The Europeans are stereotyped, but not in a too insulting way (I am European myself by the way). Some jokes are spot-on, like the Dutch bakery, the German truck driver, or the effects of absinthe. Other things are just stupid, like the portrayal of Bratislava.<BR>If I understand correctly, which I hope, the film makers want to show that Europe is a big continent, quite sophisticated (except the soccer hooligans), and freer than many Americans think.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is insane top to bottom.
6304140754|5.0|Most people probably say this isn't worth your time since it's no where compared to the orginals, however I would so disagree since most of 80's scooby-doo are really hard to find. The fact that it lacks the possible charms of a good mystery solving then unlike the 70's ones however I think it was more focus on the humor to help obtain a younger audience. Anways if you are a good scrappy-doo fan and would recommend you get this one.
B00000J7LB|5.0|Of course this is a great album.  When I saw the &quot;Remastered with bonus tracks&quot; version of this album, I clicked to find out what the bonus tracks were.<br />Of course, there's no track listing.<br />Way to go, Amazon.<BR>More reasons why I am so disappointed that you bought out CDNow and trashed their far superior site.
B00005JKG7|4.0|This film is in the era of the late seventies/early eighties new wave style horror films:Halloween/Carrie/Creepshow etc.<BR>At the time not one of the greatest but it seems to grow on you the more you watch it!!<BR>The opening sequence with the Edgar Allen Poe quote,the electronic type of music typical of the era and the atmospheric camp fire with the children.It has a ghostly seafaring feel,which draws you in.<br />The actors typical John Carpenter (Jamie Leigh Curtis,Hal Halbrook etc.)Also Tom Atkins character who starts off very go lucky but ends up very sullen and serious!!<br />The end scenes are truly scary and very atmospheric.Worth a second glance.
B00004Z459|3.0|This is the very first album of music I ever bought so it always will have a special place in my heart. The music isn't as good as lets say Tool, Shadows Fall, or Iron Maiden but ehh its good for me for nostalgic purposes. Believe it or not, my fav song is actually number 10: forgotten. Some people are saying its bad but i actually like the rhymes.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses)by Slipknot is a great CD! Though it was different than their other Cd's. There were Acoustic songs in Vol. 3 but who actually cares its still a good CD. Corey Taylor does an excellent job at Vocals. Joey is still a great Drummer, and Mick & James are still astounding at guitar . Prelude 3.0= 8/10 The Blister Exists= 10/10 Three nil= 9/10 Duality= 10/10 Opium of the People 9/10 Circle= 8/10 Welcome= 10/10 Vermillion= 8/10 Pulse of the Maggots= 10/10 Before I Forget= 7/10 Vermillion= 9/10 The Namless= 9/10 The Virus of Life= 8/10 Danger - Keep away= 7/10. Average is a 9/10. As you can see its a good CD! I downloaded the song Scream of a Slipknot fan website and it's awesome. Scream is on the japanese import but,I got it!  Scream= 9/10
B0000E1ALR|1.0|I'll have to admit that I don't know much about Bruce Springsteen.  So when I saw this for sale at Walmart, I put the &quot;Essential Linda Ronstadt&quot; down that i was going to buy my mom for mother's day and grabbed this for myself instead.  From the first track I was loving it!  I thought this man is truly a talent and couldn't wait to see how he had matured as a songwriter by the third disc.   Sadly I didn't get that far, and by the second half of disc one I realized that &quot;The Boss&quot; had done like so many other....he sold out!  Just like Pink Floyd had done with &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon,&quot;  Springcan'tsing was making generic bottom-line-only music.  Its sad to think what he could have been.
B00005JLR8|1.0|I did not like this film at all. I had hoped to see a film that is observant and critical. A film that shows the fears, hopes and challenges to immigrate to the US. Yet I found that the film that was full of cliches. It was predictable like most of the Hollywood movies. Evil looking black guy who ends up to be loving and wonderful when he meets the two cute girls.<br /><br /> A poor family who can not afford health insurance in American, ends up having a third child who is born premature. The enormous hospital bill is magically paid by &quot;someone&quot;, so the film can close with a happy end. Only in hollywood.
B000002N3N|5.0|Some music touches your heart in ways nothing else can. This CD contains just such music. This music is atmospheric and uplifting. Enya has a voice like fine crystal, pure and beyond compare. The most beautiful track on this CD is Athair Ar Nearmh - it has crystal clear beauty of such quality that you can only imagine the angels of heaven being capable of achieving it - you just need to close your eyes and feel the beauty of it. I am in complete awe ...
6303477259|5.0|From Brain Damage:<br />&quot;We chatted this week to our friends at Pink Floyd Management (formerly known as EMKA), about future and upcoming releases. Whilst at the moment there are a number of details that are far from being definite, we felt that you would want to hear what there is - however brief! Certainly from the many emails we receive each week, upcoming releases are of major interest.<br />PULSE DVD - they are hoping that this may be released, worldwide, at some point in October. Any actual dates you may have already heard for its release are simply supposition at this stage. In terms of content, the main feature is finished, and some decisions are being made at the moment with regard to additional content to complete the package. Any DVDs you already see for sale (on, for example, online auction sites) are fakes, created from either the original VHS tapes or from laserdisc. A lot of work has been done on the official version and it should be worth waiting for! We will be speaking to PFM again shortly for an update on this project...&quot;<br />Maybe THIS will be the final time that we hear that it's coming.
B00005K3NR|5.0|This movie is a very rare type of teen horror moive. It perfectly balences our fears and teen angst with phenominal acting at the same time. I think the reason why Carrie is still so fresh even today is because we all have a little bit of Carrie in all of us. All of us at one point in our lives have been teased, beaten up, or felt like you didn't belong at some point in our lives. We all know exactly how Carrie feels when all the girls laugh at her at the prom, or the excitment she felt when the most popular guy in schol askes her to the prom. We have all experienced these feeling throught out our teen years. Pino Donaggio did a superb job with the sountrack. Its so simple yet so effective. The music playing just before the blood is dumped still gets me everytime. It sounds almost like a clock ticking. Almost as if itsticking away the time that the kids have left to live. Even though I know whats gonna happen that scene never fails to scare me to death. This movie is a must see. Even todays teens will love this movie.
B000063V8R|5.0|THE THIRD SEASON OF STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION IS PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE SERIES.THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT AND THE STORIES ARE VERY WELL WRITTEN.<BR>    BEING A LONG TIME STAR TREK FAN FROM THE OLD DAYS, I MUST ADMIT I WAS SCEPTICAL ABOUT TNG, BUT I WAS VERY IMPPRESSED WITH<BR>IT, AND THE THIRD SEASON IS A DELIGHT TO VIEW!
B000286S8S|4.0|Ok, every or almost every hits package leaves off one or 2 songs we like, But in this case. NOT Enough Over Dont tell me, must have been sammy doing the tracklisting.. No humans being. Or summer nights. And what up with 3 live tracks?? they didnt thinkthis one through too good. Instead of the 3 live tracks, they could have put, so this is love, Humans being, and summer nights. and replaced not enough (song sound like a united way commerical) and put Dont tell me (which was more  of a hit than not enough) IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT..  but wait until 5150 and 0u812 come out later this year remastred..
B00005JKCH|5.0|&quot;You do too much, you're not Superman...&quot;<br /><br /> No he isn't and thank God, as this super hero is as believable as it gets. What super hero? Your friendly neighborhood Spider-man that is. Peter Parker is Spider-man as everyone already knows and he's as average, even less than average. As branded the &quot;school geek&quot;, Peter Parker succumbs to a load of torment from his fellow peers. His parents died long ago and he lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York. In Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's &quot;The Amazing Fantasy&quot; we learn of the super hero and his origin. In the heart of a scientific lab with radioactive experiments, a spider transmutes with radioactivity and bites his last victim before it dies. This last victim is Peter Parker, the harmless student. Soon after basic encounters such as almost being run over by a car, Peter finds himself able to scale walls and have acute senses, let's not forget amazing agility. A twist from the film, Parker actually engineers web spinners with new cartridges to replace older. He then becomes the infamous Spider-man after becoming a wrestling and showing off his rare fighting abilities. Which leads to the major drama behind the reason for the crime fighting super hero to arise. A robber leaves the building without being apprehended and Parker does nothing to stop it. Little does he know, that same robber turns out to be the murderer of his Uncle Ben. From one he found out it was the thief that killed his uncle, he made a pledge to follow Uncle Ben's statement, &quot;with great power, comes great responsibility.&quot; And that is where Spider-man comes from.<br /><br /> In Sam Raimi(Evil Dead, A Simple Plan)'s film take on the beloved comic book series, the premise is equally the same. Minor details are changed in that which Peter doesn't contact the spider bite from a radioactivity lab, but from a lab filled with amazing, genetic spiders. And he also does not create web spinners, but rather &quot;inherits&quot; them. As an avid fan of the comic series and a die hard fan of the character himself, I found these changes to be nothing for me. In fact it seemed more realistic, as I always gawked at the fact that a radioactivity lab would be produced for the likes of high school students. So the changes that everyone has arisen aren't a problem with me, but rather welcomed. But as the story progresses into the 121 minute film, we meet some very serious characters from the books. Norman Osborne(Dafoe), as the villainous Green Goblin, Mary Jane Watson(Dunst), Harry Osborne(Franco), and even Flash Thompson! I was quite surprised Thompson would even be in it, but the addition of him in it added a great variety of scenes. The whole film centralizes very well on each character as the film is basically the carving of the series. It's the true form of which Spider-man becomes and without these centralized themes that revolve around his evolving character, there would be nothing to base feelings toward. Parker's and Osborne's transitions were so wonderfully and delicately played out, you really felt for the characters and understood them to their maximum potential. Especially the very troubled MJ whose family life took a rough transition from her's in the comics. But this transition made her stronger and much more believable. I mean it is New York, not every family is happy go lucky as portrayed by the earlier comics. It's a different time period now, so the changes are necessary and Raimi took the right steps.<br /> I'm not going to explain the storyline much as everyone knows that it's the build up of the hero and the enemy on the horizon. But as mentioned before, I've read the comics, and I can assure you it's very true and very entertaining. Seeing Peter's teen angst against Uncle Ben was so remarkable and relatable. Mary Jane's troubled home life and Parker's resilience to let himself open up was so valid. Harry?s conflicting social life with his father, so heartbreaking. In the words of Homer Simpson, &quot;I guess it's all wrapped up in a nice little package.&quot;<br /><br /> The directing and writing of the film was also captured brilliantly. David Koepp took the comics to script(with help from Cameron's &quot;treatment&quot;) and made what is thee best super hero film ever. The lines were of things people would ACTUALLY speak about and say. The people were so realistic and the underlines of Norman Osborne's 'change' were scary and ominous. Parker's childish joy and next door neighbor crush were as though I felt I had said stuff like that long ago. The writing really helped the film and even added some very memorable, creepy moments. I won't spoil any for you, but you?ll know when you see it. And let us not forget the &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; himself, &quot;Sam Raimi.&quot; His on the target directing provided some really beautiful shots, especially the ending, that put this film number one for me. The transitions, cinematography, action, etc were all so wonderfully strewn together as if a part of a web itself! Raimi's fine work on &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; which has some of the best cinematography ever really gave him a head start for this film. The choice for Raimi over someone like Fincher or even Cameron was a well adept choice and basically made the film.<br /><br /> As always, I'm going to congratulate Danny Elfman on a superb score for the film. His work on &quot;Men In Black&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, etc have all had that eerie, yet unknown sense. The contraptions of Norman's sleek, sly and outlandish look were so overly enthralling due to the music that Elfman constructed. He captured the moment in each scene and I really feel he was the best choice for the film and should be duly noted.<br /><br /> The themes from the books themselves are quite essential and very valuable to myself. The reflections I have made from the past 470+ comics have really crafted my way of using charisma, action, and inspiration to situations that I endure each day. Spider-man has and always will be my favorite super hero of all time. I would do anything to be in that position and to think of something like that really shows how believable and relatable the character can be. The movie itself moved me, physically as I moved around in the seats with excitement and fear. Yet it also affected me emotionally as I, and many other, could just understand the basic problems people faced in the film. For a super hero movie, which I hate to regard them as, this film takes the cake in the category. But for me, it takes the whole dish in itself. Thee best film I have seen in a long while and probably one of the more memorable ones as well. I not only recommend you to see this film, but I urge you to see it.s of Homer Simpson, &quot;I guess it's all wrapped up in a nice little package.&quot;       The directing and writing of the film was also captured brilliantly. David Koepp took the comics to script(with help from Cameron's &quot;treatment&quot;) and made what is thee best super hero film ever. The lines were of things people would ACTUALLY speak about and say. The people were so realistic and the underlines of Norman Osborne's 'change' were scary and ominous. Parker's childish joy and next door neighbor crush were as though I felt I had said stuff like that long ago. The writing really helped the film and even added some very memorable, creepy moments. I won't spoil any for you, but you?ll know when you see it. And let us not forget the &quot;Cabin Boy&quot; himself, &quot;Sam Raimi.&quot; His on the target directing provided some really beautiful shots, especially the ending, that put this film number one for me. The transitions, cinematography, action, etc were all so wonderfully strewn together as if a part of a web itself! Raimi's fine work on &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; which has some of the best cinematography ever really gave him a head start for this film. The choice for Raimi over someone like Fincher or even Cameron was a well adept choice and basically made the film.          As always, I'm going to congratulate Danny Elfman on a superb score for the film. His work on &quot;Men In Black&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, etc have all had that eerie, yet unknown sense. The contraptions of Norman's sleek, sly and outlandish look were so overly enthralling due to the music that Elfman constructed. He captured the moment in each scene and I really feel he was the best choice for the film and should be duly noted.         The themes from the books themselves are quite essential and very valuable to myself. The reflections I have made from the past 470+ comics have really crafted my way of using charisma, action, and inspiration to situations that I endure each day. Spider-man has and always will be my favorite super hero of all time. I would do anything to be in that position and to think of something like that really shows how believable and relatable the character can be.

0765310015|5.0|The best beginning to a fantasy series I've read since A Game of Thrones.  Was a little difficult getting all the characters and plot lines straight, but the trouble is very worth it.  I ordered the second book from the UK since there's no way I'm going to wait for the US publication.  A very auspicious beginning.
B0002234LS|2.0|If you get the feeling you've seen this movie before it's probably because you have. In fact it was another Stephen King movie, done much better, Called, &quot;The Dark Half&quot;.<br /><br /> Oddly enough, that movie's star Timothy Hutton is a co-star in this movie. The movie stars Johnny Depp as Mort Rainey, a successful mystery writer who's holed up in his lakeside cabin trying to finish a novel even though his mind is on a messy divorce proceeding with his cheating wife (Maria Bello).<br /><br /> One day, a scary cracker (John Turturro, with a ludicrous Mississippi accent) appears on Mort's doorstep claiming the author has word-for-word stolen a story he had written years before and published it in the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.<br /><br /> He's innocent, of course, and tries to brush off the man, and even calls the police. But nothing works, and pretty soon the disgruntled amateur is stalking Mort, killing off his friends and making a most unusual demand on his literary talent.<br /><br /> Like so many Hollywood thrillers of the past decade, the movie's structure takes you along a certain path and then drops a revelation in the last act that's supposed to raise the hair on the back of your neck and force you to see the story in a whole new light.<br /><br /> But Koepp's script and direction is just not clever enough to make the trick work. The audience is way ahead of him on this one. When you add the usual thriller cliches and some graphic abuse of women and dogs to the predictability, it's altogether a bad trip.<br /><br /> Depp, who spends most of the movie in a ragged bathrobe and what looks like a blond fright wig, has some enjoyably eccentric moments as the tormented hero. But his shtick doesn't add up to a performance, and the film never kicks in as a character study or a star vehicle.
1400049628|4.0|In the vein of a traditional, realistic survival guide or the U.S. Army handbook comes Max Brooks? ?Zombie Survival Guide?.  Max Brooks gives exhaustive detail on what exactly a zombie is, what weapons to use, and in general just how to survive a zombie attack.  Even though ?The Zombie Survival Guide? is typically catalogued in the ?humor? section of the bookstore, Max Brooks plays this seriously.  At no point in this book is there any impression given that this is not fact and that this topic is one that should be taken very, very seriously.<br /><br />Brooks begins with the how Zombies are created and what it is the causes the reanimation.  Apparently it is a drug/chemical called Solanum.  When Solanum is entered into the blood stream (which can happen from a bite, or from being sprayed by infected blood) it leads to death but the Solanum then causes reanimation into a zombie.  Brooks discusses various facts and misconceptions about zombies.  For example, zombies do not have superhuman strength but what gives the illusion of this strength is that a zombie is unable to feel pain or get tired.<br /><br />Max Brooks moves on to discuss the various weapons that can be used to combat a zombie, and this too is exhaustive.  Included in the discussion are handguns, axes, rifles, assault rifles, flamethrowers, swords, pikes, fire, acid, hammers and many others that fall both inside and outside of these categories.  Brooks discusses the pros and cons of each weapon (and class of weapon), just as one might hope for in an actual survival guide.<br /><br />This volume also contains information about the four classes of zombie attacks which range from an isolated attack to having to live in an undead world.  Anything that the reader can possibly need to know to equip himself (or herself) to survive a zombie attack is contained in this book, and make no mistake, the point of this book is survival at a basic level.<br /><br />The greatest strength of this book is also its greatest flaw: Max Brooks does not wink at the reader or let the reader in on the joke.  As presented, this book is factual (though widespread media coverage has been either suppressed or manipulated) and straightforward.  If zombies attack, this is what you do and how you do it.  The joke, of course, is that there is no such thing as a zombie.  The straight forward zombie survival guide borders on being absolutely brilliant.  The greatest flaw is also the fact that this book is very straight forward and dry reading.  It reads like a manual, but the manual is for something that does not exist.  If zombies really do exist, we?ll all be in for a world of hurt.<br /><br />-Joe Sherryalso its greatest flaw: Max Brooks does not wink at the reader or let the reader in on the joke.

B000286S8S|4.0|Let me start off by saying this compilation was sorely needed, Van Halen's Best of Vol 1 was a puzzling release, track-wise. In my opinion, VH is more than deserving of a 2 disc package instead of a single (where's a box set, with outtakes, b-sides, etc?? Sorry, moving on..)and this set delivers many Dave and Sammy hits equally. Now my minor beefs....With room for over 30 tracks, no Mean Street, arguably the best VH track ever?? I agree with an earlier reviewer....Fair Warning is under-represented (as usual)...probably the best VH album ( a dead heat with VH 1). And looking at disc 2, Not Enough??...3 new tracks were expected (most best of's do this) but 3 live Dave songs sung by Sammy?? Was this done to let people hear a few Dave tunes they'll be doing live this tour? Probably...and no Summer Nights?? For a mid-summer release? They're not even playing this one live either...hmmm...anyway, overall this is a cool set, one that you can put in your cd player and let rip for a long time. You can't expect record company versions to provide the perfect setlist, we all have our favorites...but this will do..especially for VH beginners...the rest of us can always make our own &quot;true&quot; best of....bottom line, it's just great to be hearing, seeing and talking about one of the best rock bands of all time again...Van Halen!!
B00005JMYG|4.0|I went to see this with no more expectation for this movie, than to have some good laughs and on that, Anchorman delivered.  I liked that it was set in the 70's and in San Diego!   No place I would have rather grown up in the 70's, than in SoCal!  :))  Great music too!  <br />Once again, some Amazon reviewers are too serious.  If you actually go to this movie intending to see something with a deep plot or soul shaking message, you will be disappointed!   Go rent the Mel Gibson/Jesus movie for that!
140003180X|5.0|This series gets better and better. This fourth book took another turn which I think is a good idea!  It is good!!<br /><br />It is not only about Mma Ramotswe but also those who are part of her life, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, Mma Makutsi, the apprentices, the children. Each book tells us a little more about the people in her life, and this book is about Mma Makutsi. What a delightful character, if you think Mma Ramotswe is clever and funny, wait to learn more about Mma Makutsi. I just laughed and could imagine her walking with her new green shoes that usually tell a lot about their owner! Just those simple remarks that we might neglect sometimes but it is what makes the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency so famous and successful.<br /><br />Mma Makutsi opens her own project which proves to be as successful and she falls in love for the first time! Just charming! Watching her dance and flutter...<br /><br />There is also the new detective agency, but that proved a failure compared to Mma's insight and sincerity. It is a small country where everybody knows everbody... you just need to ask keeping in mind the Botswana morality.<br /><br />Mr. Smith never fails to state his views on humanity, culture and even politics, but you never get bored of those remarks, you expect them as you would know that this is what Mma Ramotswe would say in this and that situation!<br /><br />Still, there is no wedding date!

They have a formula that works (one thats often ripped off in the trip hop genre) samples of old music (and odd sounds) accompanied by heavy down-tempo beats. i like to listen to this cd after ive smoked a nice big one. yeah... <br /> <br />and according to the official website theyre working on a new cd...
0140177396|5.0|Deep down the story carries an important message about dreams and their fulfillment. The story revolves around George and Lennie, two immigrant workers, who believe that someday they will not be working for someone else, but would have their own ranch. The characters of George and Lennie are strikingly different yet they seem to be complementing each other. While, George is depicted to be an energetic man, Lennie is mentally retarted. George is shown to be very protective of Lennie. Steinbeck, very nicely depicts that the protection accorded to Lennie is not act of altruism, but instead, in a way it is a selfish act, an act that makes George feel that he is important and someone is dependent on him.   The other characters also carry their story far beyond what is explicitly written about them. Crook's situation highlight a strange sense of numbness and indifference to emotions and feeling, apparently a consequence of oppression of a black American those days. Candy, the old man represents how a man clings to hope and future in both physical and meta-physical sense of the world. With his dog been shot dead, Candy is shattered only to be rejuvenated by the thought that one day he would be sharing the dream of independence with George and Lennie. Curley's wife, the nemesis of Lennie and the dreams of George and (now) Candy is a woman who carries a strong sense of deprevation.  Like George and Lennie, she also had a dream, a dream of becoming an actress, which just passed her by. Her life was an empty hope, which reflects in her acts in the story.   Steinbeck's descriptive style is par excellence. The story is simple, yet the description of the characters and the locations make you feel a part of the story.
B000067J1H|3.0|OK, blend Matrix, Guy Richi, and Osama Bin Laden and you get a masterpiece? A funny comedy, not more. Fight Club is brilliant in the beginning with all that satire, but when it gets philosophical, I felt like I have seen this before.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|&quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; is the best Foo Fighters album, and that's saying a lot as they're all pretty good.<br />What sets it apart and above the rest is the depth of the album.  For instance, while &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; begins with three great songs it sort of tapers off as the album progresses.  Not so with &quot;The Colour and the Shape.&quot;<br />Songs like &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;My Hero&quot;, &quot;Everlong&quot;, and &quot;Walking After You&quot; are well-known (and maybe slighly overplayed when it comes to the first two) but all 13 songs are quality listens.  Moreover, the album grows on you with each spin -- I remember liking some songs but not others at first but now really like the whole thing.  I really doubt this is an album you would grow tired of or only hear a lot at first and then let collect dust.<br />I think the Foo Fighters are one of the coolest bands around and this represents the coolest of their work.  Each song is pretty good; the guitar on this album is rugged and hard-charging without ever devolving into headache-inducing noise.
0780622553|5.0|&quot;Dark City&quot; will be remembered as the film that bridged the film noir genre at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st.<br />Alex Proyas directs a suspenseful story on the meaning of reality in a dark, foreboding dream world. As people go about their lives, almost no one notices something is seriously wrong with their world. Until one man wakes up alone, one fateful night.<br />John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a hotel room to find he's lost most of his memories. Even worse, he may have committed a string of brutal murders against local prostitutes. Fleeing the crime scene, he finds himself pursued by not only the police, but also a mysterious cabal of cloaked men. <br />Assisted by a cowed doctor and a supportive woman who claims to be his wife, Murdoch learns the truth of the city, and its secret Masters, the Strangers.<br />The feature actors all give strong performances, as a confused Murdoch and a supportive Jennifer Connelly as Emma. Keifer Sutherland is impressive, especially when you contrast the cowardly Dr. Scheber vs. his characters from &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; or &quot;24.&quot;<br />The sets are as compelling as the actors, and credit is due for the deliberate &quot;retro&quot; look of the city. Making of movie of this style look creative guts, and it paid off.<br />I just beg of the producers of the story one request: don't make a sequel, this story will always stand as a one and only!
B00005JMEW|2.0|At the risk of sinking my lofty Amazon.com reviewer ranking into the depths, I must warn you that I have come not to praise this film, but to bury it. Well, maybe not bury it, but certainly kick a little dirt on the glittering monument that is all these five-star reviews. Now wait....take that finger off the &quot;unhelpful&quot; button (yes, you!). Hear me out first. Then vote me down. It's the American way.<br /><br /> First let me admit by saying I am not overly enamored of Quentin Tarantino. I thought &quot;Reservior Dogs&quot; was excellent, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; somewhat over-rated but still quite good, and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; predictable, boring and forgettable. On the plus side I think &quot;QT&quot; is highly imaginative in a kind of Dr. Dre sense, meaning he has no original ideas himself but is a genius at cobbling together his manifold influences (film, TV, comic books, et al) and creating something new out of them; I think he is a film-buff's film-maker, who truly loves the 70s pop culture he grew up in and celebrates it at every turn,, I think he's extremely funny and has cojones of brass to make such offbeat films in a Hollywood where hundred-million dollar cookie-cutter projects are the order of the day.<br /><br /> On the down side I think Tarantino's dialogue, while highly entertaining in small doses, grows a bit tedious and self-indulgent over time (the long, boring scene between Bruce Willis and his girlfriend in the hotel room in &quot;PF&quot; is a good example);<br /><br /> doesn't have much of a sense of pace (his films often drag), and seems to have the kind of juvenile obsession with graphic blood-spilling and violence that is usually found in people who have seen neither firsthand.<br /><br /> All these things are on display in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; a quirky, retro-style takeoff on, well, just about everything from Japanese chopsockey flicks to Italian westerns to the awful &quot;Batman&quot; series in the early 1960s (just with lots more blood and dismemberment). As usual, QT laces the film with homages and peppers it with appearances from familiar faces and pet actors(David Carradine of &quot;Kung Fu&quot; fame; Michael Madsen, Uma Thurman et al): you have to admire the highly personal way he makes a film, as if it were a class project and not a major motion picture release with millions in studio money riding on it. The story, like the characters, is so straightforward as to be non-existent: a retired assassin is put into a coma by her treacherous former comrades, and later wakes up looking to deliver some serious payback, which is accomplished with a custom-made Japanese kitana and a lot of droll one-liners. The actors are good, the dialogue ain't bad (the scene with the Japanese swordmaker and his angry assistant is hilarious, until it drags on too long) and the visuals are sumptuous. Unfortunately, the film has too many self-indulgencies and boring spots: even the scene where she slaughters the Crazy 88 goes on too long, and all the flying limbs and fire-hydrant jets of blood get tedious after awhile. That, and the ever-present martial-arts movie question of why one of them didn't just shoot her a la Indiana Jones in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot;<br /><br /> Of course, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is not meant to be taken seriously. The movie takes place in a stylized quasi-reality and the blood and beheadings are done in such an over-the-top way that even people easily grossed out or offended would have to laugh (and if they don't, they probably should know better than to watch). The problem is, QT doesn't quite stick to the formula: the scene where the Bride kills the black assassin in front of her own child is valid as far as the story goes, but it is not in the best of taste.<br /><br /> I am aware that this film was originally one big three or four hour production, later cut into two separate movies, and that this may have effected the story and pacing, etc., but I can only judge the movie on what I saw, and I wasn't all that impressed. It wasn't great. It was, however, interesting enough to see, &quot;Volume II.&quot;<br /><br /> Now....go ahead and hit that &quot;unhelpful&quot; key.

B00002E224|5.0|I was one of the few who actually watched this movie when it was in the theatres in 1995.  9 years later and I still think its one of the best romances I have ever seen.  For me, the dialogue was  very real.  They used the same venacular and posed the type of philosophical questions that my friends at the time often brought up in our discussions.  Of course it is still a drama and connecting with  a stranger in Vienna is something that has never happened to me, but the idealism and the romantic spirit of the film epitomizes the 20 something college student I was in 1995.
B000286S8S|4.0|Boy, all you folks who bought 'The Best of Van Halen' must be steamed! 'Cause this renders that disc superflous.   Now my (minor) gripes....   1). No chronological order! I thought it was gonna be like ZZ Top's recent 2 disc best of, start at the beginning and go forward. A disc of Dave and then of Sammy woulda been great, but what the hey. I guess this is how VH wanted it...   BUT... it works against them. The sequencing really plays up how much better a songwriter, singer, and performer Dave was. Nothing against Sammy, but his songs fall into 3 categories 1)I'm horny 2)She's gonna give me everything tonite 3)Prom themes (&quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Right Now&quot;). Whereas Dave wrote stuff like &quot;Jamie's Crying&quot;, &quot;And the Cradle Will Rock&quot;, &quot;Jump&quot;. The man was versatile. Plus he provides us with one of the greatest moments in rock at the end of &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;. Mr. Stud gets shot down: &quot;Hey what's your name?... Hey! Where ya going?!?&quot; BUT, he laughs at himself and shrugs it off (&quot;I love 'em! I need 'em!&quot;). And how many hard rockin' front men are confident enough to pull off something like that?   Plus I think Dave really challenged the band with his songs; just listen to the diversity of the arrangements (especailly with something like &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; or &quot;Could This Be Magic&quot;. Yeah, neither one's on this set, but do you think Sammy could thunk them up?).   2). Three live tracks?!? Yuck. I'da put in &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot;, &quot;Could This Be Magic&quot; and &quot;Humans Being&quot;. But I guess this is Warner's way of making us still have to buy the individual albums... or download or something... Sammy's diatribe during &quot;Panama&quot; is just embarrassing.   But, all in all, I am very happy with this set. Has (almost) all the VH I want in one convenient package..   Oh, I sent an e-mail to Ice Magazine about the &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; glitch. The are investigating (the got a lotta e-mails about this!).
B0000024YL|4.0|I'm only 3 months older than this album, but I listen to it all the time. With the recent releases of the 20 track &quot;Best Of&quot;, and the 2-disc &quot;Essential&quot; collection, this may not be in such demand, but the songs here are no less classic. 14 hits including &quot;Sounds Of Silence&quot;, &quot;The Boxer&quot;, &quot;I Am A Rock&quot;, and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, among others. As I mentioned before, you may want to get the &quot;Best Of&quot; instead, as it has 6 more songs, but this collection is still the &quot;Greatest&quot;.
B0000033OZ|4.0|(Actual Rating-3.5 Stars)<br />Emerson, Lake, and Palmer(1970). Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's First Album.<br />Around 1970, the supergroup Emerson, Lake, and Palmer was formed, which combined Nice's Keith Emerson's Amazing technical wizardry with the keyboard and the Moog Synthesizer, King Crimson's Singer/Guitarist Greg Lake, and Drummer Carl Palmer of Atomic Rooster. With much critical fanfare, and with the success of Nice and Crimson King, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer were destined for Classic Rock fame, and sure enough, their self-titled debut climbed to the American Top 20 and the British Top 5, and forever after they were superstars. Combining instrumentals(Ex. &quot;The Barbarian&quot; and &quot;The Three Fates&quot;) and Classic Hard Rockers(Ex. &quot;Lucky Man&quot; and &quot;Knife-Edge&quot;), 'Emerson, Lake and Palmer' creates a diverse album, but its main focus is on the keyboard, while very little guitar is added into the mix. So is 'Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's sound to predominately on the keyboard, or does that make the album better? If you ask me, a little bit of both.....Read on the find out why!<br />Track Ratings-<br />The Barbarian- &quot;The Barbarian&quot;'s a Keyboard/Moog heavy Rocker, and Palmer's frenzied drumming and Lake's short bursts of static-y guitar riffs fit in nicely alongside the mostly keyboard instrumental. A rather dark and enigmatic song, ELP pull it off nicely.<br />Take A Pebble- &quot;Take A Pebble&quot; starts off with Lake's amazing vocals behind Emerson's jazzy piano, but soon Emerson takes center-stage, using a Synth line as background music, but his piano is the main instrument, encompassing jazz, folk, and classical styles in this 12 minute epic. Since this is basically a 12 minute piano track, it gets very repetitive and redundant after a while, but overall a decent track, just don't be expecting any Rock 'N Roll, but a lengthy piano piece.<br />Knife-Edge- &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; starts off quickly, with Lake's Beatles-inspired vocals being backed up by a synthesizer beat much along the lines of what The Doors do. All the musicians are Top-Notch here, and &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; comes out sounding like The Doors, yet this Classic Rocker contains its own originality.<br />The Three Fates: Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos- &quot;The Three Fates&quot; showcases his immense Classical Piano skills, and remind me very clearly of Rick Wakeman's solo Piano projects. Since I'm not a huge fan of the piano, this track got a little old, but if you are a fan of Classical Piano, this song is a masterpiece in that sense.<br />Tank- &quot;Tank&quot; starts off with a low bass beat surrounded by Emerson's Moog Synthesizer line, which sounds odd and reminds me of &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Palmer shows us his admirable skills, dishing out a lengthy drum solo, proving Emerson isn't the only musician. &quot;Tank&quot; sounds oddly disjointed, as if Emerson and Palmer were trying to show off their respective skills. A Pretty Good song.<br />Lucky Man- &quot;Lucky Man&quot; became a big hit, and why not? &quot;Lucky Man&quot; combines Lake's sweetly innocent vocals and acoustic guitar playing, creating a ballad that seems genuine, almost as if Lake was heartbroken when he sang this. A beautiful and compassionate ballad, it's a superb song and my favorite on the album.<br />Overall, 'Emerson, Lake, and Palmer' is a dominated by the piano, and Emerson seems to be the entire focus of the album, while Palmer and Lake seem to be left in the cold. That is unfortuneate, because Lake is one of the best vocalists I've ever heard, and his guitar is quite beautiful. Palmer is a great drummer, but his talent can only be seen on tracks like &quot;The Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Tank&quot;, and &quot;Knife-Edge&quot;. Although Emerson is an excellent pianist and synth player, one of the best in fact, I think his playing gets in the way of the other musicians, basically giving them the cold shoulder. &quot;The Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; all incorporate the musicians, and they are all excellent numbers that make ELP's self-titled debut worth the price. Be warned though, this album is not for everyone, and DO NOT come in expecting the album to be totally Hard Rock, as you may be disappointed.<br />RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF CLASSIC ROCK, CLASSICAL PIANO, CLASSICAL MUSIC, PROG ROCK, ART ROCK, EMERSON, LAKE, AND PALMER, FANS OF JAZZ OR ANY OF THE BANDMEMBERS BANDS. IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE OVER-ABUNDANT PIANO, ELP'S DEBUT MIGHT JUST BE ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE ALBUMS.<br />Also Recommended-<br />In The Court of the Crimson King- King Crimson<br />Five Bridges- The Nice<br />The Doors- The Doors<br />Thanks For Reading!&quot;Knife-Edge&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; all incorporate the musicians, and they are all excellent numbers that make ELP's self-titled debut worth the price.

B000068FUS|3.0|I must say that I never cared about &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot; much, but I saw this compared to other things I did like, and gave it a shot. Overall I'd say it's pretty good. They definitely walk that line between classic southern rock, and some of the recent alt-country bands, and I can see how &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot; could please either crowd. There's a few slower/speaking parts that drag this down some, but tracks like &quot;72 (this highway's mean)&quot; and &quot;Guitar Man Upstairs&quot; rock along well. &quot;Ronnie And Neil&quot; is really good, and actually sounds like &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; to my ears, which may be the point. Not every song amazes, and I wonder if this wouldn't have been a better 15 track single disc, but oh well. So even though this is a decent album, I think when the mood strikes, I'll reach for &quot;My Morning Jacket&quot; instead.
1400032717|2.0|Wow.  What a chore.  My wife recommended it so I began reading it.  50 pages in I put it down.  The short, choppy senteneces, the long, pointless tangents, and plodding story were too much for me to bear.   <br /> <br />Next thing I know my brother is recommending the book.  His taste is usualy impeccable so I give it another shot.  Same problems as before.  this time however, I forced myself to finish it hoping against hope something, ANYTHING would make the experience enjoyable.  No dice. <br /> <br />Using the mentally challenged kid as narrator obviously worked for some - not for me.
B000002BYD|4.0|In my years of listening to &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, I've enjoyed everything from &quot;Ten&quot; to &quot;Riot Act&quot;. If I had to keep just one of their albums, the one I find is the best of all things &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, it would be this one. It's not the straight forward rock record the first two were, but also not quite the experiments that &quot;Vitology&quot; and &quot;No Code&quot; are. It's the perfect middle ground of everything before it. There's a number of grunge/punk rockers like &quot;Brain Of J&quot; and &quot;Do The Evolution&quot;, as well as some mellower tracks which I feel they excell at, like &quot;Low Light&quot; and &quot;All Those Yesterdays&quot;. Plus bonafide hit material like &quot;Given to Fly&quot; and &quot;Wishlist&quot; both are. Now again, I like most everything they've done, but this is the disc I'm most &quot;Faithful&quot; to.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|okei folks this dvd is  must for everone.... even if you dont like floyd :).... the tracks are just amazing the footage is great sound quality is very rich....

B000001FZK|5.0|Listening to this and its predescessors Spirit Of Eden and the underrated Color Of Spring, you'd have no idea that Talk Talk started out as an also-ran '80s synth-pop outfit. The band's evolution alienated their original record label (EMI) and probably turned off a good deal of their old fanbase, but they left 3 beautiful, unique records that are musically &quot;post-rock&quot; long before that term entered the indie lexicon.<br /><br /> Gone are most of the synths and any hint of verse/chorus/verse structure. The instrumentation is mostly organic--trumpet, contrabass, acoustic guitar and bass, organ, piano, harmonica, woodwinds, viola, acoustic drums, and touches of electric guitar. The sound is extremely sparse--though the song lengths (on average about 7 minutes) are &quot;progressive&quot; the music does not adhere to the usual prog cliches. Late-period Talk Talk is not about excess displays of virtuosity. This album proves you can say far more with 3 seconds of well-placed silence than a 3-minute barrage of expertly played notes. Laughing Stock has an incredible sense of space and airiness. Every guitar, horn, organ, string, and bass note has purpose and advances the song--the muted horns in the mournful Myrrman, the burning electric guitar slashes in the angry Ascension Day (probably the closest to &quot;rock&quot; this album ever gets), the floating organ and somehow frightening dissonant chords in After The Flood, the prominent drums and uplifting piano on New Grass, and intermittent bass notes giving way to eerie stretches of quiet on the closer Runeii.<br /><br /> Over this backdrop floats Mark Hollis. His plaintive, mournful, and sometimes indiscernible voice is one of pure emotion, and the lyrics speak of redemption, mourning, spirituality (&quot;maybe Christianity will come westward&quot;), hope, anger, and loss.<br /><br /> My rather dry description does not do this remarkable record any justice, and I apologize. Ultimately, Laughing Stock is a beautiful, harrowing album that speaks directly to the human spirit, and is truly one of a kind. Highly, highly recommended. Also pick up its companion (in both theme and music) Spirit Of Eden.is a beautiful, harrowing album that speaks directly to the human spirit, and is truly one of a kind. Highly, highly recommended.

B000002U8G|5.0|i love this album personaly one of these days echoes and the whole piece is great. if you wanna chill out to something nice one afternoon while tokin a fattie and get lost in outer space listen to it.... i gurantee you ll explore things you never have before....
B00008S2VG|3.0|For those who say Madonna is over, go to Billboard.com and look at her concert ticket grosses. In New York, she sold out SIX shows to 185,000 fans and had similar success in other venues. This is good, considering she's coming off of the weakest album of her career. AMERICAN LIFE  is NOT the disaster it was made out to be. The album was poorly timed with the new era McCarthyism that developed in the United States last year. Madonna was quietly dixie chicked in every way possible. That said, there are some songs on here that are UTTER crap. Nobody Knows Me sounds like it was written by a three year old. &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; is...oh well, stupid. &quot;Mother and Father&quot;..gosh, what was she on when she wrote that song? Then again, the album has its gems as well. The title track is funky and fun to listen to, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is absolutely beautiful, and &quot;Intervention&quot; is one of Madonna's best tracks ever. Once again, this album is NOT the disaster it was made to be.
B000006TRV|5.0|I'm amazed that this album has actually received bad reviews.<br />Has our culture become so banal that Spears/Jackson pop music is the base line? This is art folks. If you have any self awareness, this album will affect you. Damn it, it should make you, at the very least, teary eyed.<br />I admit that I blur the album and the film into one experience. The whole project is amazing - that includes the live DVD performance in Berlin.<br />War, insanity, drug use, fame, authority figures who don't give a damn, (that includes your precious, little mommy), self-absorption, and the desperate need for longing -  come on folks, you got to be kidding when you trash this album.<br />How can one not feel when Pink calls home and his wife's lover answers the damn phone? Then again, maybe you've never been completely betrayed during a moment of adulterated innocence and weakness.<br />Sure, I have every Pink Floyd album and then some. The Wall isn't the typical psychadelic, experimental mastery that one might typically equate with this band. But, the apparent simplicity is the genius.<br />This is Pink Floyd. This is a masterpiece.<br />Centuries from now adolescents, and adults who can empathize with that angst of just being, will embrace this album.<br />Buy it...
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Lets set this straight. I am 31, I don't like our new wave of pop especially losers like Justin Timberlake and Usher. However, I find this CD unique. No, I didn't buy this album for myself, I bought it for my 12 year old who is a teenybopper. Does that take away from how great this album is. <br />Many of these one star reviews don't even talk about this album. They never listened to this album. Hello everyone, in case you didn't know, Amazon.com is for people who listened to the CD! Duh! <br />I would like to make clear that no matter how personal and shocking these songs are, Britney Spears could never be an R&amp;B/Rock star like she is trying to be. She will always be bubblegum pop, thats how her voice is. <br />Now a review for the tracklisting:<br />Me Against The Music- Overplayed, great song but gets tiring...8/10<br />I Got That Boom Boom- I love it....this is the only rap I really liked and danced to.-8/10<br />Showdown- Love the chorus &quot;here comes the showdown, what comes around comes around, and the crowd is waiting...ahhh&quot;. 10/10<br />Breathe on me- too whispery for me. Trying to be shocking like Madonna....don't try it Britney, you make a fool out of yourself. 5/10<br />Toxic-Annoying! Repetitive but unique and genius. Obviously the sound is enhanced with the technology...not credible. 6/10<br />Outrageous- Worst song on the album. I hate it so much...should have been left out. 2/10<br />Touch of My Hand- Like Breathe on me, but better. 7/10<br />The Hook Up- Jamaican vibe going on. Okay...6/10<br />Shadow-Second best ballad on album. Chorus is catchy. 10/10<br />Brave New Girl- Song is great but low points due to the fact that it sounds LIKE HILARY DUFF SINGING! ENHANCED BY TECHNOLOGY....THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT ITS A GREAT SONG. She raps at the beginning...that doesn't work for you Britney! 8/10<br />Everytime- Best track on the album....best ballad...much better than stupid weisel Justin Timberlake's Cry ME a River. Both Everytime and Cry ME a River are both about their break up! 11/10<br />Me Agains The Music Remix- Unnecessary, and waste of disc space. 2/10<br />Overall, better than her previous three albums combined!
B000002C1W|5.0|To hear people say this is one of Pink Floyds not-so-great albums makes me want to throw fists. This cd is simply stunning and I LOVE it. The CD has songs which will take you to a whole other dimension and it's definately something to listen to when you just feel like chillaxing, it will set you in the mood. <br /> This is my first official Pink Floyd album that I bought, and I'm very impressed. I loved the Wall, but I think I love this one much more! :D The best song by far on the CD is Learning to Fly, which has both impressive lyrics and an a tune, but One Slip comes very close as well. I recommend this cd highly, and if I were queen of the world I would order everyone to have this cd in thier collection! <br />Amazing! :D
B00009L1OB|2.0|The Third Album was supposed to be the triumphal, world-conquering follow-up to &quot;Rio&quot;. Instead it comes across as over-produced smarmy pop with an overblown title and bad cover art to boot. This is the one D2 album I hardly ever listen to. &quot;The Reflex&quot; is a promising start, but fair warning, the album mix is distinctly different from the Nile Rodgers produced single remix that hit #1 on the charts. &quot;New Moon On Monday&quot; is okay, but then the tracks descend into insincere pop inanity. &quot;Cracks in the Pavement&quot; and &quot;I take the Dice&quot; are pure pablum filler. Side one grinds to a close with &quot;Of Crime And Passion&quot;, a song trying so hard to be edgy it ultimately spins off the 'ol turntable. &quot;Union of the Snake&quot; is solid chart material, the strongest song with a solid Bowie bass beat, excellent percussion and some good horn work. &quot;Shadows On Your Side&quot; comes off as an overdone uptempo number that seems to get to the chorus inside of 10 seconds and repeat it every 30 seconds thereafter. The band finally take a breath and stretch their creativity on &quot;Tiger Tiger&quot;, an evocative instrumental number that leads in to the big finish &quot;The Seventh Stranger&quot;, which is one of my favorite ballad/atmospheric numbers from the band, and Andy Taylor's guitar solo theme work is gorgeous. The album ends abruptly, far short of it's intended goal. This album needs a serious &quot;Director's Cut&quot; style updating from Nick and Simon to bring it back to respectability. If they had included the &quot;Is There Something I Should Know&quot; single, the outstanding B-side &quot;Secret Oktober&quot; and the remixed single version of &quot;The Reflex&quot; they might have had something. Buy this version only if you have to have it to complete your collection.
0743490304|3.0|Not particularly well written sort of on a Steven King level. I agree with apparently many others about the product placements - I wonder how much he made from those??? And if they weren't placements, then that may give some insight as to the shallowness of his characterizations. The anti-business rhetoric didn't sit well with me either. But if you keep something in the bathroom to occupy otherwise wasted time, this is as good as any.
6300214435|5.0|The &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy will endure for a long time--everyone adores cliffhangers and romance, and these three films have plenty of both. Of the three, the middle film, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, is by far the ickiest: the assortment of bugs, monkey brains, millipedes, burning bodies, and unique open-heart surgeries are visually more stunning than tangles of snakes and melting Nazis. But, like the other two, TEMPLE OF DOOM is loaded with action, great pacing, and on-the-money performances.
B00005JKCH|5.0|SPIDER-MAN and SPIDER-MAN 2 ROCK!! I've never liked &quot;superhero&quot; movies. In fact, most of them bore me to tears. On a whim and needing some R&R I went to see Spidey 2. What a surprise! It is an incredibly romantic, moving film. After seeing it, I had to rent Spidey 1. It was almost (not quite) as good (but so much better than almost any other recent movie I can think of) and seeing it helps one understand several key plot points in Spidey 2. <br />  <br /> The guys behind these two movies know how to structure a story that delivers a powerful emotional payoff. Along the way they take you into a fascinating exploration of issues that will interest any person who aspires to...whatever you aspire to that's unusual and positive. There aren't many movies I can unreservedly recommend. These 2 movies are the exceptions. Special word of advice: in Spidey 2, if you find yourself getting very, very frustrated by Peter Parker's endless inability to resolve his situation (after all it is rather unusual!!) stick with it. The director, Sam Raimi, has got you in the palm of his hand. Trust me. You can trust Raimi. He won't disappoint. Won't say more except that I laughed til I cried when I learned in Spidey 1 how Spiderman got his name and his suit. And also in Spidey 1 when Uncle Ben tells Peter he understands what he's going thru...well, if you haven't seen it I won't spoil it but it's very funny and moving at the same time. One final thing: you can almost taste the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Deeelicious. Whoever cast those two deserves an extra percent or two of the gross.  <br />  <br /> Okay, one more final thing: the values throughout this film are exquisite. What a difference from the decadent and/or superficial shrunken heart of most movies today. In both Spidey's there is never a sour, nihilistic note. They are edgy, non-sappy movies with a huge, romantic heart. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to any kid older than 12 or any grown-upwhose soul hasn't shriveled into prune-like resignation at life's vicissitudes. Younger children may be troubled by the villains and some of the violence (which is truly and gratefully de minimis and not emphasized). All in all, I unreservedly recommend these movies for all those who like big-hearted movies that make you feel very, very good and stimulate you to think and wonder along the way.
B000092Q4U|5.0|probably close to 25 times now, maybe more, the first time being way back when they went as BTP and only had some splits out with Zed and Agents of Satan. (As you might surmise, their a retardedly impressive live act). They were an amazing band then and are considerably more impressive as time as only increased their talents. Some people might view their massive increase in popularity and signing to Epic of course as selling out but f&amp;%k em, if any band deserves a shot at being considered a Black Sabbath, Slayer or Judas Priest of metal for this decade, Lamb of God is the band. Their new track I've heard on MP3 and seen live (Laid to Rest) is just as brutally heavy as anything they've done, I see no respite in their aggressive ways simply because of a new label. LOG will continue to deliver crushing metal as they have promised, I don't see this band churning out a black metal anytime soon. <br />This might be considered the album that really gave the metal community the collective kick in the rear it needed to recoqnize this band as being a contender for one of the best metal bands ever. The riffs fly by fast and heavy and display a rare mix of agressivness and catchiness which many metal bands I'm sure would give their left nut to be able to write. Compared to New American Gospel the songs are more involved and therefore not quite as immediate. NAG was just an instant kick boot to the face with it's vicious attack. ATPB will take a listen or two to fully appreciate (this isn't like Gorguts though with Obscura, only a few listens, not 200) but once you do you'll realize this is every bit as menacing and violent as NAG ever was. There isn't a track on this album I'd label as average, while some are better then others (Ruin, Blood Junkie and Vigil being highlights), every track is a metal masterpiece. Delay no longer if you don't own this album, buy it, gather your buddies, open some beers and headbang till it f&amp;%king hurts
1881273156|5.0|This book REALLY gives you the steps to improving your relationship.  My husband and I have a great relationship already and there still was much food for thought in there.  I also liked it because it have a Christian base to it- and to me, that is important.
B0001FGBL6|5.0|With haunting melodies, Bach/Mozart inspired chorals, and heavy riffs this is a must have.  If you like Tristania and Nightwish you should fall in love with this CD.  The female vocals take the front stage similar to Nightwish (as opposed to Tristania where it is more the growling).  However the lush chorus sections are very reminiscent of World of Glass. Well worth the money.
B00023BLXK|5.0|OMG this movie is a definite must see!! While the first Dirty Dancing was undeniably a classic this movie just has something more. You just can't take your eyes off the screen as they dance because it's so amazing!! The story is interesting and sweet, and Diego Luna as Javier is just brilliant. Please give this movie a chance!!!:-)
B000286S8S|3.0|Almost all of the hits are here, and I like the mixing of the Dave and Sam tunes.  However I wish they would have included something new, for example some live Dave songs, or maybe a couple of unreleased songs.  Overall I like what they did, however all VH fans already have all of this (except for the 3 new 'kind of lame' songs).  Hopefully they'll put out a box set sometime soon, that will be something to look forward to.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|The combination of these two artists give a unique and excellent master piece. I have play this CD to many friends, ALL OF THEM has liked it and rated as excellent. Hope they will make another one.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Many years ago, the graffito &quot;Clapton is God&quot; started appearing on brick walls all over the western world.  As we all know, God can create things the way She wants, and sometimes, her choices are a little strange.<br />Face it, Clapton has probably done more than any modern artist to bring Robert Johnson's music to a wide, popular audience.  If he'd wanted to, he could've done note-for-note, &quot;pure&quot; covers of all 19 of Johnson's compositions.  He's got the chops, and he's good for it.  But if he had done so, it would;ve been no more than an empty, mindless exercise in musical impression. Of anyone, Clapton has earned the right to record these tunes any way he wants.<br />I think he does a great job with this album.  His arrangements are vivid and unique.  From the mischevious &quot;They're Red Hot&quot; to the spooky, mournful &quot;Me and the Devil&quot;, he gives each song in this album a new life, and he gives us a new way of listening.<br />I think the production was just a tad too slick, which is the only reason I stopped at four stars.  This is definitely Robert Johnson &quot;lite&quot;, but I enjoyed hearing Clapton's creativity and genius in this recording.  I think it's a heartfelt tribute to Mr. Johnson and to classic blues, from someone who's been standing at the crossroads for a long, long time.

6303282237|5.0|My sentiments are pretty much identical with the ones of the gentleman Sri, from India. I am very disapointed that this magnificantly depicted story has not found favor with the DVD formating industry. After all stories such as 'Tale of two cities', 'Count of Monte Christo', 'Man in the iron Mask','Scarlet Pimpernel', the list goes on..;has been formated in DVD format. I can only wonder if the reason for not having 'El Cid' on disc was a matter of preference or economics at time of decision? I understand that not everyone may enjoy this 'Genre'but personally I believe it's one of the best re-telling of a magnificent, by-gone era and is certainly worthy of DVD formating-if for nothing else but to retain History. I truly wish that this masterpiece of cinamatic splendor would be re-formated and re-mastered digitally. It is such a great story and so masterfully depicted that it most certainly worthy of telling to future generations-and what better way to preserve this on DVD format, since it keeps a lot better than Tape?
B000286S8S|3.0|I can deal with the non-chronological ordering of the songs, I can appreciate the remastered tunes from the main two VH eras, I can forgive the omission of the 1-2 songs from the Cherone debacle that barely would qualify to make a VH &quot;Best of.&quot; <br />  <br /> What has me scratching my head big time, though, is dropping the three new songs right after &quot;Eruption&quot;? Not saying it has to be &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; there, but tad strange to me nonetheless. <br />  <br /> Every greatest hits will be missing someone's favorites, but only one song from the woefully underrated Fair Warning?!?!? Even wearing my hits-minded music label cap, would having &quot;Mean Street&quot; or &quot;So This Is Love?&quot; killed them? <br />  <br /> Don't even get me started on the re-treading of the three live songs...that we've already heard studio versions of elsewhere on the compilation - ugh! <br />  <br /> Also, was the engineer asleep at the board when &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; just clips out? No fade, no fancy new edit to end the song, no smooth mix into the next track. Makes me wonder if Warner Bros. will be re-pressing. <br />  <br /> Minor gripe, too: why have the instrumental prelude to &quot;Not Enough,&quot; while ignoring the &quot;Intruder&quot; lead-in to &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot;? Eh, what'cha gonna do? <br />  <br /> You know, three stars may be too generous, but I can't diss the boys too much. <br />
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|First off this 2:31:1 Widescreen Edition DVD comes with absolutely NO extras whatsoever, just the basic subtitles. (Not even a commentary.) After that dissappointment I was ready to view the film.<br /><br /> Incredible. Some of the best male performers today. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins deservedly earned those Oscars. Man, I was impressed. The story centers on 3 young best friends who are torn apart by a horrendous crime. Years later these friends are thrown together, by yet another horrendous crime. It seems their lives have been drastically altered by the incident that befell their childhood friend, Dave, and none of them have been the same since.<br /><br /> I don't want to go through the plot, like so many have, but this film was extremely effective. Mainly because of the strong script, and unbelievably amazing actors to create this heartbreaking story. I read through most of these reviews and most people are either extremely for it, or against it in every sense of the word. Talks of horrible directing, unclear motivations, and a poor script. I, personally, completely disagree. This film was amazing for the simple fact of the strong character analysis. A strong beginning, a steady and suspensely middle, and a powerful ending. Each person had struggle and purpose. They were passionate, grieving, loving, confused, in denial, frustrated, all of the multifascited feelings to convey in a beautiful array of levels and deliveries.<br /><br /> **SPOILERS**<br /><br /> Some people didn't understand this picture and certain scenes where Dave (Robbins) got into the car with the brothers, and so forth. Simply put, when Dave was abducted as a child, he denied that he was sexually assaulted by the assailents and has kept this horrible experience hidden deep within him for nearly thirty years. This is emphasized in the scenes when Bacon's character told his partner that &quot;Dave wasn't sexually assaulted,&quot; and also when Dave tells his wife the name's of the kidnappers and she doesn't know what he's talking about. This means that Dave never really spoke to his wife about his abduction, and never went in detail about his 4 days in hell. Dave had held all these feelings in and wasn't even able to tell his wife the truth about who he really killed that evening. If he exposed the truth about killing a pedophile while saving the teenager it would have come out that Dave, was indeed raped all those years ago. Dave was ashamed and was trapped inside himself and was falling further and further in. (Also to answer the question why did Dave get into the car with the brothers... Well Dave grew up with Jimmy (Penn) and the brothers, so he's known them his whole life...why WOULDN'T he get into the car with them??)<br /><br /> Penn's character was a handful from the start of the film, causing trouble out of boredom. After the incident with Dave, Jimmy's life seemed to crumble along with him. He sort of blamed himself for what happened to Dave, since he was the one who innitiated the writing in the cement. He seemed to distance himself from people. He was constantly getting into trouble and associating himself with the wrong crowd, earning some jail time. His daughter was the only thing that kept him from completely crossing over into the crime scene. Now he is a family man who loves his children more than anything in the world. And the unusual scene at the end of the film when his wife &quot;seduces&quot; him after he tells her they killed Dave, was a scene to calm his nerves and assure him that they all would know that Jimmy only killed Dave because he was the number one suspect of his daughters murder, and even Dave's wife agreed. Jimmy's wife needed him to go on and provide for the family he still has. She wanted him to continue to be the &quot;King&quot; of the streets to love and protect them at all cost. She wanted everyone to know that to mess with his family is the wrong thing to do. And since Dave's wife even thought that Dave killed thegirl, that is every reason to rid the world of a lunatic, that was bound to commit a crime due to his horrific past.<br /><br /> Bacon's character was the one who couldn't stay in a stable relationship with his wife. He was lost and alone, and didn't know how to deal with this otherwise typical situation. The ending almost seemed that now that Dave, the hurtful part of their life, was gone they were all able to move on with their lives and forget about the past that had been weighing them down all these years. They were both ready to start over again.<br /><br /> **END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br /> These are the things that I observed and analysed while watching the film. Most people will think otherwise, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But never the less, this is a film that should be seen and experienced first hand, if not for the text, for the amazing performances, including the amazingly subtle Marica Gay Harden as Dave's tormented wife.illed the girl, that is every reason to rid the world of a lunatic, that was bound to commit a crime due to his horrific past. <br />  <br /> Bacon's character was the one who couldn't stay in a stable relationship with his wife.

This book described tons of humorous punctuation situations I could really relate to, as well as relating interesting information about the history of punctuation (and its proper use). I first read this in an airport gate lounge and laughed out loud so much that everyone wanted to know what I was reading! Very articulate, informative, and funny. Sticklers of the world, unite!!
B000024A70|5.0|The UK version of Queen's Greatest Hits is superior to the American version, in my opinion.  It includes all of Queen's UK Top 20 Hits from 1974 to 1980.  (&quot;Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; is included because it was the lead track on the hit &quot;Queen's First EP&quot;.)  It should be noted that these are the single versions of the songs, which are sometimes different than the album versions.  The most notable differences are on &quot;Bicycle Race&quot;, which is almost a minute shorter than the album version, and &quot;Flash&quot;, which includes dialogue from the movie, which the album version does not.  This is the definitive compilation of Queen's early years.
B000001FAU|5.0|On Sept 3rd 1976 I went to see my first ever concert at the Liverpool Empire, it was Blackmore's Rainbow and it changed my life. <br />The monstrous setup of a giant Rainbow over the stage, guitar smashing, 1812 overture drum pounding, stereo effect keyboard solos and Dio's amazing voice made this concert a comparison for every concert I have been to since. I remeber Blackmore lauching his destroyed strat in to the audience smacking some kid clean in chops then he was mobbed by people fighting for the parts, the theatre was wrecked after this concert.<br />There there is the album - every part is stunningly incredible, from the artwork, gatefold sleeve [vinyl] quality pressing by Polydor. This album remains the treasure of my collection 26 years later.<br />Simply ahead of its time, setting trends for years to come this is an original piece of musical work. It has the best ever combination of  rock band and orchestra in the studio. My only complaint of this album is that is was simply too short :-(
B00005JL9B|5.0|This is, hands down, the BEST MOVIE COMING OUT OF JAPAN IN YEARS. As a reviewer who read the book first and loved it, I had high expectations for this movie and it did not let me down. Here's a quick plot summary: the Japanese government is in chaos. The adults are afraid the youth, who are apparently uncontrollable and boycott school. Therefore, the government institutes `Battle Royale', a program designed to rein in the youth. A ninth-grade class is randomly selected each year, sent to a deserted island, supplied with weapons, and forced to kill each other until there is one survivor. I would have thought it difficult for a movie to track all 42 kids. In the book, this is fine since the book is 600+ pages. But this also works very well in the movie since the director somehow gives almost all the characters substantial screen time and v. memorable scenes. He doesn't cut any character short. And even the short scenes have real poignancy. Therefore, we remember almost all the characters, what they did, and how they died. <br />THE ACTING IS SUPERB. The kids in this movie are played by actors between 15-20 years old. With the exception of one or two, the actors were v. believable and conveyed all the teenage angst, suspicion, hatred, rage, love, goodness, and all the other goodies in the book. And even when they are doing terrible things to each other, they are still sympathetic characters since we understand they are deathly scared and are still young....that unique balance is crucial to the movie's success.  Just to mention a few standouts: ERI ISHIKAWA (Yukie Utsumi) is the best actress, best-looking girl, and my favorite in this entire movie. She's perfect as the class representative who tries to calm everyone down but ends up feeling the same suspicion that is doing her classmates in. Her lighthouse scene is the most memorable scene in the film, and in my opinion, one of the best scenes in the history of cinema; just watch her face...aahhhh, that is perfect acting... TAKESHI \\"BEAT\\" KITANO (Kitano) is the perfect combination of menace and sympathy as the teacher who sends the kids to their deaths and reads out the names of the dead with phrases like, `Here is your list of goners! Only 3 dead. You're slacking off, I'm disappointed with you!' I love how emotions can flicker on and off his face; at one point, he can be scary and mean and terrible as hell; at other times, we feel sorry for him! TATSUYA FUJIWARA (Shuya Nanahara) and AKI MAEDA (Noriko Nakagawa) are fantastic as the couple we root for. Aki Maeda, especially, looks adorable in the movie and conveys innocence and purity so well. TARO YAMAMOTO (Shogo Kawada) is one of my fave characters in this movie and is the best bad-ass I've seen in movies for a while. He looks simultaneously tough and soft, which gives him an interesting complex. MASANOBU ANDO (Kazuo Kiriyama) and KOU SHIBASAKI (Mitsuko Souma) are deliciously wicked as the class's two crazy/wild ones, the two that are consciously going out to kill their classmates without remorse. And, on a vain note, SOUSUKE TAKAOKA, who plays the sweet and caring Hiroki Sugimura, is a major hottie. <br />The DIALOGUE in this movie, like the book, is sometimes cringe-worthy (you know, like, `Damn! I survived, thanks to my excellent bulletproof vest!!'). However, because it is usually delivered perfectly and on target, I hardly noticed it. (It may also be because the actors were speaking Japanese and I was only reading subtitles because I can't understand Japanese.) Although I did like the book better than the movie (tells you how good the book was since I think the movie is FANTASTIC), there are some moments in the movie that outshine even the book because of the acting and the way the dialogue is delivered. For example, Yukie's LIGHTHOUSE SCENE is much better in the movie than it is in the book. I love the way their voices become delirious and the way their anger escalates (it's nearly palpable!). <br />Also, the setting is well-done, too. There are a lot of neutral and cool colors like whites, grays, and cool blues that set the mood and provide a contrast for all the bright red blood. That reminds me: this movie has, like the book, been criticized as VIOLENT EXPLOITATION. That is understandable since the movie shows young classmates killing each other in messy, realistic ways, some willfully and some out of fear. The movie is v. bloody and v. violent and sometimes gratuitous. I normally don't like violence, I don't like blood and guts and gore flying everywhere. I really hate those `Halloween' and `Freddy' and `Texas Chainsaw Massacre' type movies because blood spills needlessly and in an excessive/stupid way. But `Battle Royale' is different. The violence will sometimes make your stomach turn, but you'll think, that's the only way it could have been done. <br />And lastly, I have to praise the way CLASSICAL MUSIC is used in this movie. It's done in a v. artsy way that makes you think about the horrible things you've seen and make sense out of it, and I loved it. The use of Mozart and Giuseppe Verdi's `DIES IRAE (REQUIEM MASS)' in the opening sequence is especially incredible. It practically lets you know that you're in for a wild, thought-provoking, horrific, unique, and exciting ride. Also, MASAMICHI AMANO (the composer) did a great job on the original music in `Battle Royale.' I've listened to most of the soundtrack and think every one I've listened to has real poignancy and feeling. The way it is used in the film is even better; it brings even more meaning to what the kids are feeling and what they are doing. <br />This is an INCREDIBLE movie - a mind-blowing exposition of the minds of teenagers and a fantastic exercise of style. I LOVED this movie. After watching it, you will be thinking about it for days; all the scenes of teenage angst will not leave your mind too easily. I give it my highest recommendation...go watch it right now!!
B000286S8S|5.0|I had pre-ordered &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; and actually got it yesterday (one day before the street date). The first thing that should be mentioned is that the track order as listed here is incorrect. While the first track is indeed &quot;Eruption&quot;,the rest of the songs actually alternate between those fronted by Roth and Hagar, which creates a nice mix. The three new songs &quot;It's About Time&quot;, &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot;, and &quot;Learning To See&quot; are tracks 2,3, & 4 on Disc 1. Also a previous reviewer mentioned a song called &quot;Message in A Bottle&quot; and he was disappointed that it had not been included. I think he was referring to &quot;Feels So Good&quot;, and it is here, it's track #11 on Disc 2.<br /><br /> Here is the actual order of the tracks:<br /><br /> DISC 1<br /><br /> Eruption<br /><br /> It's About Time NEW!<br /><br /> Up For Breakfast NEW!<br /><br /> Learning To See NEW!<br /><br /> Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love<br /><br /> Finish What Ya Started<br /><br /> You Really Got Me<br /><br /> Dreams<br /><br /> Hot For Teacher<br /><br /> Poundcake<br /><br /> And the Cradle Will Rock...<br /><br /> Black and Blue<br /><br /> Jump<br /><br /> Top of the World<br /><br /> (Oh) Pretty Woman<br /><br /> Love Walks In<br /><br /> Beautiful Girls<br /><br /> Can't Stop Lovin' You<br /><br /> Unchained<br /><br /> DISC 2<br /><br /> Panama<br /><br /> Best of Both Worlds<br /><br /> Jamie's Cryin'<br /><br /> Runaround<br /><br /> I'll Wait<br /><br /> Why Can't This Be Love<br /><br /> Runnin' With the Devil<br /><br /> When Its Love<br /><br /> Dancing in the Street<br /><br /> Not Enough<br /><br /> Feels So Good<br /><br /> Right Now<br /><br /> Everybody Wants Some!!!<br /><br /> Dance the Night Away<br /><br /> Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love (LIVE)<br /><br /> Panama (LIVE)<br /><br /> Jump (LIVE)<br /><br /> An excellent compilation.

B000002UA9|4.0|If I had to explain to you who The Beatles were, it would be obvious that you have been living under a rock for the past forty years, or since the time you were born. They have produced some of the most enjoyable, thoughtful and inspiring music of all time but this album proves something that is frequently forgotten, they are one hell of a rock and roll band. <br /> <br />Before the over-dubs and studio trickery, The Beatles were pure rock and roll with leather jackets, greased hair and lots of energy, before Brian Epstein made them a bit more polite. This album is good to remember The Beatles when they were just a little rock and roll group. Fun but at the same time, it didn't have the impact that something like 'Strawberry Fields Forever' or 'In My Life' did. That's not to say it's bad, it's just not as good as they proved themselves to be. I do recommend picking up this album, though, as you will have a great time listening to it. There's a few clunkers here but any album that starts off with 'I Saw Her Standing There' and finishes off with 'Twist and Shout' can't be too bad in my book. <br /> <br />If you want a good introduction to The Beatles without getting too much into the later stuff, you're better off picking up something like 'A Hard Day's Night' which shows just what a talented writing and singing group they could be. This album is essential for all us fans, of course, and fun to put on in the summer and twist and shout to.
B0000009OU|5.0|Music critic Gene Santoro says that this is his favorite Costello album because Costello lets the Attractions improvise (whereas later masterpieces such as Imperial Bedroom are tightly arranged). For me, this album's finest songs are &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;Lipstick Vogue,&quot; both lyrical masterpieces.<br /><br /> (&quot;I keep thinking about your mother/ No, I don't want to lick them/ Don't want to be your lover/ Just want to be your victim/ I don't go out much at night/ I don't go out much at all/ Did you think you were the only one/ Who was waiting for a call?&quot;)<br /><br /> There's no one better than Elvis, ever.
B000002UAC|4.0|While their first album 'Please Please Me' had been to clumsy and disjointed to make a great impression, this more than makes up for it. There are too many brilliant numbers here to sit down and discuss. 'All My Loving', 'It Won't Be Long', 'Roll Over Beethoven'... <br /> <br />Beatlemania was starting just as this album was coming out but The Beatles were un-affected by their huge fanbase and didn't get too big-headed for their own good. This album shows that even under all sorts of different pressures, their musical output always remained the same: brilliant. This is where the writing talents of Lennon/McCartney finally come into their true colors while George occasionally got his chance to shine (If you want some good George numbers, you're best going to the later stuff on 'Abbey Road').  <br /> <br />We're still not reaching some of the best music of The Beatles' career but already they are starting to show their talents as great song writers and effective singers.
B000002KFJ|5.0|The first 14 minutes of this album, culminating in Megalomania are the most bizarre, weirdest, heaviest wall of music I've ever heard. If you've never traveled out of body into the astral regions of existence but have always wanted to, this is your vehicle. Althouh I think at times the last few tracks miss the mark, Hole in the Sky, Symptom of the Universe, and Megalomania make up for it in abundance. Trust me, you'll never be the same again after you've finished Megalomania. It's simply blows my mind. It's really beyond words. I's' way out there in the astral planes. And maybe that's not far enough.
B000148KK2|1.0|Remember the scene in the Nicholas Cage movie &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; where the old man is dying and they play him his favorite Sinatra to soothe him during his last moments? Diana Krall's past few CDs are like that to me.... So, fool me, I bought it without listening to it first. It is bad. Very bad. It's not romantic at all; it doesn't flow from one song to the next; and the singing and lyrics are awful. There is one nice ballad, &quot;Narrow Daylight,&quot; but I'm way past buying a CD for just one song. A past reviewer who praised it, nonetheless called it a &quot;hard listen.&quot; In these times, we could all use the gentle, soothing, and romantic listen that was Diana Krall.

0618526412|2.0|I found the storyline too meandering with not enough substance.  It was not a gripping page turner.  The characters were oddballs and not terribly interesting oddballs at that.  I'm very surprised this was one of Oprah's picks. It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list.
B00028HBL6|5.0|This movie was the best movie ever made, im a 16 year old catholic and i dont go much to church but i felt everything that jesus went through deep inside of me. Some people might not like the movie but thats their problem, God knows what evil spirit was toying with their mind. This movie was very well directed and left me speechless in the theatre. Mel Gibson is an awesome actor and he has now proven to be an awesome director also! Much love to all my peeps in the Bx baby~peace

B000007492|5.0|I remember listening to Supertramp when I was just a little boy in the early eighties. I didn't know the name of the band.

I just love the theme and sound of those songs...and more.<br />This compilation is probably the best Supertramp greatest hits album they can come out with. Its got all the big hits, the highlights are: Breakfast In America, a sweet little pop song; Goodbye Stranger, another sweet pop song that the lyrics of will play back in your head everytime you read the title (ok, you can stop now!); The Logical Song, a logical choice, this song was one of Supertramp's biggest singles and it is possibly their best written song; From Now On, a nice sing along; Its Raining Again and Give A Little Bit, for the reasons listed above. <br />Recommended<br />A-
0385504209|3.0|After reading Dan Brown's Angels and Demons and The Digital Fortress, I was anxious to read the best-selling DaVinci Code.  Although it was fast and entertaining, it was not without some flaws.<br />DaVinci Code combines the religious theme of Angels and Demons with the cryptography theme of The Digital Fortress.  Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon (of Angels and Demons) is called in by the French police when the curator of the Louvre of found murdered.  Before the curator dies, he leaves several cryptic messages and arranges his body in a symbolic pose.  Cryptographer Sophie Neveu shows up at the scene, and she quickly informs Langdon that he is their chief suspect.  Neveu is also the granddaughter of the victim.  They set out on a whirlwind adventure to solve the murder on their own.<br />Three other men are also found murdered the same night, and it is discovered that all four victims belonged to a secret society, The Priory of Sion.  Robert and Sophie's search leads them to such topics as the beginning of Christianity, the role of Mary Magdalene, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, Pagan Worship, and the search for the Holy Grail.  But what was a big disappointment is that The DaVinci Code is filled with a large number of historical inaccuracies.  Even a novice will know that Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul's, and not Westminster.  The plot is also unbelievable in spots, although the plot for Angels and Demons was more of a stretch.<br />Still, I listened to the unabridged DaVinci Code on a long trip, and reader Paul Michael did a stellar job of bringing this story to life.  I thought his accents were especially good.<br />So, accept this book for what it is-an entertaining work of fiction, but not a definitive historic research.
B00004NRWH|4.0|It is often the case that the latest album from a band on first listening sounds better than the previous one, simply because the material is fresh and you may have played to death the band's current offering.  <br /> <br />I find my self in a unique position with Nickelback in that I listened to five of their albums for the first time over the course of a day and did not know which came first or last - The State came out top of my list. In truth I could tell it was an earlier album - less commercial in sound and cover design - but I think it is the best nevertheless. <br /> <br />Ok so Nickelback sound a little 'samey' at times - using similar riffs, chords and vocal harmonies - but lets not get too analytical - The State is a cracking rock album - wherever you are, whatever you're doing - it just does the trick.
B0000024W3|3.0|Let me point out that this is a very challenging 80 minutes of music. I was intimidated by this album when I first started collecting Bob Dylan's work. Following the advice of many reviewers and critics, I skipped from 'Nashville Skyline' to 'New Morning' and never even considered adding this to my collection. <br />  <br /> Last winter, my curiosity got the best of me and I purchased 'Self Portrait' on a whim. I wasn't sure what to expect, I'd already heard 'Dylan' and 'Knocked Out Loaded' and many other albums that compete for the title of &quot;Lowest Point in Dylan's Career,&quot; but I was shocked. 'Self Portrait' does not belong in that category. <br />  <br /> True, there are far too many throw-away songs. However, at least half of the album is great. Another reviewer wrote that this album is like an old, comfy sweater. What a perfect comparison. Sifting through 'Self Portrait,' I have found many songs that are catchy, comfortable and unimposing. <br />  <br /> I won't pretend that this is worthy of 5 stars, but I do think that anyone who gives 'Self Portrait' a chance will be pleasantly surprised - provided they drop all expectations and just listen. I'm very glad that I did - I'm always using &quot;Days of '49&quot; and &quot;Alberta #2&quot; in my mix tapes! Maybe you'll find some favorites too. <br />
0872860175|5.0|Allen Ginsberg's poem &quot;America&quot; in the Howl collection is excellent. Ginsberg has been called the best post-1945 poet in America. I think that is certainly true of his poetry from the 1950s and '60s, if not later. It's funny that &quot;Howl&quot; was called obscene when first published and such a big fuss was made about it--drawn-out trial, etc. It really is one of the great works of poetry of the 20th century, in the same way that Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; is of the previous century. What Ginsberg did with language was something radical, refreshing, hip and new, and his messages had great appeal to those disgusted with the Establishment and with various forms of social injustice. As you read Ginsberg, some of his poetical phrases can be hard to decipher, but for every obscure line the poem is often saved by the next line which is beautiful and crystal-clear. What he writes about in &quot;Howl&quot; is somewhat of a different world from ours, physically--a world of Dharma bums, hipsters, Jazz, Buddhism, Dadaism, Communism, etc... but emotionally, what he writes is very relevent to our times because his work is an attack on America's materialism and social complacency.  <br />  <br /> David Rehak <br /> author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;
B000002KDG|5.0|It's hard to believe that I picked up &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; on vinyl more than 20 years ago.  I just downloaded the album the other day and it still holds up all these years! God, I recommend everybody go and revisit this album (or pick it up for the first time if you've never heard it before).  This album still rocks!
B0001MDP3G|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie.  Nicole Kidman is too old to play such a young character.  The story started depressing and ended suicidal!  I actually bought this dvd and after I watched it one time, I threw it in the trash.  The only good thing about it was Renee Z's excellent rendition of a tough country girl.  Only watch this movie if you like self-punishment.
B000002URV|5.0|I picked up this CD way back when it was first released because I liked the CD cover. I was hoping I stumbled across some cool new goth metal like &quot;King Diamond&quot; or maybe another &quot;Alice Cooper&quot;. I popped in the CD and the first thing I hear is &quot;The Voice of Enigma&quot;. I knew right away that this was going to be different than anything else I was currently listening to. There was no screaming guitar, or blistering drum and bass combos. This was simply a beautiful experience. I was swept away on the audial experience of language, song, music and sound effects that make up &quot;Enigma&quot;. By now you have most likely heard &quot;Sadness&quot; or one of Enigma's other songs on a compilation CD like &quot;Pure Moods&quot;. But, don't be satisfied with the single song, pick up the album. Enjoy the Enigma experience from start to finish. This CD is never far from my car stereo, and when I have a particularly bad day, &quot;Enigma&quot; is one of the first things I turn to. I can't explain it but, this music makes you feel better after listening, more at peace I guess. I know that sounds corny, but give it a try. &quot;Enigma&quot; is the best mistake I ever made.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie is a true and faithful telling about the last hours of Our Savior.  Finally, a movie that is not a watered down version of how Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. Not for the fainthearted, because as graphic as this movie is, this is as close as we will get to being there to witness the actual crucifixion of Christ.  Mel Gibson is to be commended for having courage to pursue and complete such a beautiful and brilliant masterpiece, and obviously a work of love and faith.

No matter what movie is being reviewed there is always some mother that thinks every movie is supposed to be made for children.  This movie is dark.  Guess what lady, real life is pretty dark sometimes too.  Hopefully art and entertainment would reflect this in a honest way.  Otherwise art is very shallow.  I'm pretty sure the number one intranet commodity isn't disney videos.  Have you turned on CNN lately?  p.s. (South Park is not a cartoon for children.)<br /><br />4.  You find out intresting information that you would not have otherwise.<br /><br />3.  Srew what the critics think.<br /><br />2.  You are able to make better purchases by learning from other's mistakes.<br /><br />1.  redemtion:  The director's vision is astonishing.  All of the sudden you realize you just watched an entire movie about someone who was never born.  What a great story.  One can sit and think about this one for a while.

B0001907DA|4.0|A rag-tag group of individuals, for different reasons, join together to help fight crime! Where could it go wrong? A movie so popular, that it spawned 6 sequels, with a new one on the way, making a total of 8 in the near future. Regardless of people's opinions on the quality of later films, the first few remain classics in most people's hearts. Well, at least mine. <br />  <br /> Police Academy: 20th Anniversary Box set features all seven films, in widescreen format except for 3 of them. Each disc contains a 6 to 10 minute featurette with original cast members shedding light on some of their favorite scenes. <br />  <br /> 1. Police Academy <br />  <br /> The film that brought audiences to their knees with laughter, Police Academy was one of the pioneers of 80's comedy. After several attempts at trying to make it on the outside, Steve Gutenberg as Carey Mahoney is given the choice of facing jail time or doing something with his life and becoming a police cadet as a favor from one of his parent's friends. Carey soon discovers that he is not unlike his odd group of counterparts, including Larvell Jones, played by stand-up comedian Michael Winslow, a human microphone, the late David Graf as Eugene Tackleberry, a life-time NRA member if there ever was one, and former NFL star, Bubba Smith as Moses Hightower, a man whos passion to fight crime is just as much as his penchant for flowers. 1st best out of 7. <br />  <br /> 2. Police Academy: Their First Assignment <br />  <br /> The majority of the previous film's stars come back for the sequel, but the person who truly steals the show is Bobcat Goldwaith's Zed, a quintessential 80's hardrocking thug, who just happens to love Family Affairs and is a vegetarian. Hey, at least he has morals. Also, SNL allum Tim Kazurinsky is the Zed's polar opposite in the role of Sweetchuck. 2nd best out of 7. <br />  <br /> 3. Police Academy 3: Back in Training <br />  <br /> Sadly, the role that the series was previously on beins it decline with the third installment as we loose G.W. Bailey's excellent character, Lieu. Harris. Art Metrano is instead brought in as a replacement as Cmndt. Mauser, but fails to equal the same side-splitting laughs. The saving grace in this film is Lance Kinsey's Capt. Proctor, a loveable, well-meaning suck-up/lackey to Mauser. Set in a different location, the third film has it's moments, but can not compare to the previous installments. 5th best out of 7. <br />  <br /> Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol <br />  <br /> When budgets have become next to none, and crime is at it's top, what other choice does the city have but to ask of it's citizens to become volunteer policemen? Now in their third movie, Zed and Sweetchuck once again steal the show. With several great aerial stunts, breakthrough roles from Tony Hawk and David Spade, the fourth movie definately makes up for the 3rd film. 3rd best out of 7 <br />  <br /> Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach <br />  <br /> By the fifth film, the series had lost most of it's original cast, but it desperatly tried to revive the series with new cast members and new locations. Probably the most kid friendly of the whole series, filled with more oddball/dumb humor, it easily out ranks #3 as the worst yet. 6th best out of 7. <br />  <br /> Police Academy 6: City Under Siege <br />  <br /> Once again, with a lose of the majority of original characters, times are hard for the series, but City Under Siege tries it's best to do what it can with what it has. One of the more memorable and funny in the series, #6 delivers with some great laughs, but fails to match the previous movie's sucess and ranks 4th out of 7. <br /> Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow <br />  <br /> With only 5 of the original cast members left, for some odd reason the officers are picked to go to Moscow to help stop an evil Russian sterotypical character played by Ron Perlman. Perlman's character has created
B00009W0WM|5.0|Obviously there is a lot of hype about this old movie, calling it &quot;one of the greatest films ever made&quot; and all that. My opinion on the hype is this: there are plenty of films out there that have more psychological insight into its characters and explore deeper themes than CASABLANCA does. Despite the fact that it uses a wartime setting and has a cast of various nationalities, it merely uses these elements as a backdrop to a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama. The whole thing is basically safe old-style Hollywood entertainment, but that's really all it is. Nothing more, nothing less. (CASABLANCA is a film that would probably appeal more to older people who feel nostalgia for the &quot;golden age&quot; of Hollywood than to us progressive younger folk.) To call this film &quot;one of the best films of the cinema ever&quot; would be a gross overstatement of its quality, in my opinion. To me, CASABLANCA is hardly that, and I would not rate this high on my own personal list of the greatest films I've ever seen.      The reason I give this movie five stars, though, is that, as old-style Hollywood entertainment, it is pretty glorious. Here is a romantic melodrama that actually had me interested in its characters and situations from roughly beginning to end. The screenwriters and director Michael Curtiz never make the central romantic tensions overblown in any way (something that GONE WITH THE WIND did, to its detriment I think). It all remains nicely down-to-earth, and the actors help make it convincing and fun to watch, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles. Bogart, especially, does a good job with bringing out the sides of his character Rick Blaine, a man who outwardly shows cynicism and indifference, but deep inside still has feelings for Ilsa Lund and really does want to help her and her husband escape the country. (His final sacrificial act at the end of CASABLANCA is one of the most sublime things Hollywood has ever dreamed up.) And of course no discussion of this movie could dare to skip over the now-classic dialogue of this movie, which remains nicely edgy and flavored. (I particularly liked Rick's response to the officer who asks about his nationality, as well as his &quot;I stick my head out for nobody&quot; philosophy.) All in all, here is a romantic movie that never gets soapy, and its honesty of feeling is something to be truly admired.      CASABLANCA remains, to this day, an example of Hollywood entertainment at its skillful best. It doesn't have ambitions to be anything other than diverting, and on that level it succeeds magnificently. Just don't come into the movie expecting &quot;the greatest movie you'll ever see.&quot; Recommended.

I have to say tht Nickelback Needs Melody in their music !! There r no moving ballads and no excellent acoustic numbers at all in all their albums ! i wonder why ? The only great point abt Nickelback is...without any doubt .. Chad Kroeger !! hes a fantastic singer with a great range and a captivating voice !! He shud better go solo !! Nickelback fans plz dont mind... but this is true..they r not making good music despite 3 albums or so !!<BR>           If u want to hear some great music .. Listen to the band REVIS !! and they will make u forget nickelback (ofcourse not chad )!! Give a try to REVIS !!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This had to be THE most boring movie I've ever watched! I watched it all the way through....thinking it had to get better. It never did.
B000286S8S|4.0|Well, a few remarks:<br /><br /> 1) There's only three songs on the other GH one that is not on the &quot;Best of Both Worlds&quot; one. Those three are Humans Being, and the two &quot;new&quot; DLR songs (Can't Get this Stuff no More & Me Wise Magic). Other than that, every other song from that one is on this one.<br /><br /> 2) This has three new songs with Sammy on it. Of the two I've heard so far, I rather like 'em - I think It's About Time is a great song.<br /><br /> 3) There's nothing from the Gary Cherone album on here. I know most people don't care for it, but I do. They could have used the single (Without You), or possibly Dirty Water Dog, which was a great song.<br /><br /> 4) There are three live songs (Talkin About Love, Panama, Jump) that are also on here as studio versions. There are plenty of other songs that could have been here - instead they put three songs on here twice. WHAT IS WITH THAT?<br /><br /> As with any Greatest Hits album there will always be preferences that were left off. For me, that's &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot;. That's the perfect end of album song, to me. Should ahve been here, instead of three live versions of songs that are already on the package elsewhere!<br /><br /> I suppose it will come down to whether or not you've already got the first one. If you do, you'll be buying what essentially amounts to &quot;Disc 2&quot; of the other Greatest Hits package plus a couple of extras.<br /><br /> Of course, now you can't dump your copy of Volume 1 either, because it's got three songs that aren't on any other Van Halen album - and Me Wise Magic is one of the best DLR era VH tracks.<br /><br /> About Best of Both Worlds? It's a great greatest hits album, has just about every major Van Halen hit, plus a few good new tracks. Worth it, I think.
0783225857|5.0|Destruction of the innocent by the evils of the society<BR>Kuldip Kumar Garhwal<br />\\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but... sing their heart out for us. That's why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" The movie 'To kill a mockingbird' depicts the destruction of the innocent by the evils of the society. Mockingbird is a symbol of innocence, characterized by Tom Robinson and Arthur Radley (Boo) where racial prejudice and ignorance are the symbol of evils in the society. <br />Tom Robinson, an African-American is accused by Mayela, a white woman, of sexual molestation. Atticus, a prominent lawyer of the town Maycomb, has proved that Tom Robinson is innocent but still the \\"all-white jury\\" convicts Robinson of the guilt. Tom Robinson, a \\"quite humble respectable Negro\\", becomes the victim of racial prejudice. Arthur Radley (Boo) has been emotionally destroyed by his father, as his father did not let him step outside the house. Boo is one of the \\"mockingbirds\\" in the story, who is the victim of ignorance; evil of the society which is trying to kill the good. Boo had a deep affection for children, which is later displayed in the story, when Boo saves Jim and Scout from Bob Ewells.<br />\\"There are some men in the world who are born to do unpleasant jobs for us; your father is one of them\\", said Maudie to Jim after his father (Atticus) lost the case of Tom Robinson. Atticus helped his children to learn values of life and he showed them how to live life by the values; preaching by practicing. Atticus allowed his children to call him by his name instead of 'father'. He wanted his children to explore freedom, but also taught them to stay in limits. Jim is brave, intelligent, and caring. He learns courage, dignity, and value of life from his father. He is transforming into adulthood. <br />Scout is still a kid; she does not know anything about the existence of evil in the society. She is learning about evils from the real life example of the victims (Tom and Boo) of the evils inthe society. By the end of the story Scout's perspective on life develops from that of an innocent child into that of a near grown up. \\"Mr. Tate was right\\", said Scout to Atticus, after Mr. Tate, the town Sheriff explained Atticus indirectly that whatever Boo did was correct and he is not supposed to be punished for that. \\"It would be like shooting the mockingbird, wouldn't it.\\" Scout shows a high level of ability to comprehend at the age of five, and understands the whole situation and judges what is right and what is wrong. <br />The Music Director of the movie has done an excellent job. Music plays an important role in the movie, by setting the mood for what is been screened. The movie starts with a musical note, which seems like it is played by a kid, one note at a time. The movie also has gothic music to create the horrifying or thrilling environment, when Jim and Scout were walking home after the Halloween Party and they had an encounter with Bob Ewells. Most of the places the movie has melancholy music to produce the feeling of thoughtful sadness. The pleasant arrangements of musical notes in the movie create an atmosphere where we feel that we are a part of the movie, and we go back into our nostalgic memories and look back into our childhood. The movie itself seems like a mockingbird song. <br />My favorite scene in the movie is when Atticus is walking out of the courtroom after the trial is over and all the \\"colored\\" people sitting in the balcony stands up to pay respect to Atticus, a white man, who tried his level best to save a \\"Negro.\\" The Reverend says to Scout who was sitting, \\"Stand up Jean Louise. Your father is passing.\\"  The scene says it all, there is not much dialogue but the expressions on the faces of the black people was marvelous, with a slow melancholy music at the background. As it this situation there is nothing left to say, because everyone knows in the courtroom that Tom Robinson is not guilty but still the jury has convicted him of the rape, just because of racial prejudice.<br />_____________________________________________<br />Kuldip Kumar Garhwal(...)
0316776963|4.0|I have never read a book so consistantly funny. I wasn't laughing at every page, but there was at least one line or paragraph in each essay that honestly made me laugh out loud. I won't give any away; enough are posted here. Any more, and I'd give away half the laughs.<br />I'll admit, I wondered what was going on in Sedaris' head at some points, but at others his thoughts so closely mirrored my own that it was just too funny. His one-liners and anecdotes are wonderfully witty (my favorite was the American tourists in Paris who arrogantly think no one else on the train speaks English). He accurately points out negative qualities of Americans in the second half, yet he doesn't talk down to his readers as he himself is a lazy loaf who spends most of his time in France in a movie theater. Just wonderful. You'll laugh your way through it.
B00000JZI9|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully photographed, intelligent, positively flavored and exciting westerns you are likely to see. I rate this up there with &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;Tombstone&quot;. All cast members are superb and perfect in their parts. There is humor, but realism in costume and sets. Linda Hunt is marvelous, as is Kevin Kline and Kevin Costner. Scott Glenn's best film in my opinion.  <br />  <br /> The action is non-stop, but not gratuitous... for every bullet means something. This is also okay for teens, since blood and sex are at a minimum and the action is so intense.  <br />  <br /> For sheer beauty of photography, and scope and expanse, you can't beat this one... and the new DVD transfer in anamorphic widescreen is clean, clear and color corrected. The stereophonic soundtrack with the gorgeous score by Bruce Boughton will move you.  <br />  <br /> Top marks for this one!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This album is something i havent come across in a long time. It was original and the lyrics made so much sense and this artist just completely clicks with whoever is listening. I went to see him in concert and hes a great guitar player and keyboard player and all the fans loved him because he is such a great singer. He was also very nice and  signed autographs and took pictures. One of the few people that are as great live as well on the cd. I strongly recommend this album more than anything else you get along with Stripped by Gavin Degraw which is coming out soon.
1592400876|2.0|I bought this book hoping it would be informative and maybe a little humorous, judging from the title, but it turned out to just be a big rant about the stupid people the author has encountered and the grammatical mistakes they make in writing. A much better approach to tackling grammar with a side of humor can be found in the two hilarious and information-packed volumes by Bill Walsh, &quot;Lapsing Into a Comma&quot; and &quot;The Elephants of Style.&quot; If anyone deserves to be on a bestseller list for a cool book on grammar, it's Bill.
B00012QM8G|3.0|Watching &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is a bit like identifying the remains of your child, or witnessing an execution. In a word, devastating. I happened to see this movie in a three-generation family group, at a theatre, and on leaving we witnessed a well-dressed, dark-haired, middle-aged woman exit the theatre, prop herself up against a utility pole and sob uncontrollably.  You don't witness a scene this after the average blockbuster like &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;.<BR>    In the car on the way home, my father, a World War II veteran who was at the liberation of Belsen concentration camp, said &quot;The feeling I have is anger against the Germans ... I've seen the real thing and now I've had enough. No more for me.&quot; I recalled the little girl in the red coat, and tears involuntarily streamed down my face. <BR>    You can read reviews, right here at this site, that testify to the widespread resentment of the Jews and their alleged conspiracy to steal everyone's money. &quot;The Jews control banking and the media&quot;, they argue. &quot;What about other massacres like the Alamo? Don't they count?&quot; As the late Jack Benny used to say, with the left hand propping the pensive right forearm, the other hand cradling the right side of his deadpan face: &quot;Could I have a moment to think about that?&quot;<BR>    &quot;Schindler's List'' is carefully and expensively made propaganda; as such, it violates the creative principle of suspension of disbelief and is not a whole work of art, nor is it a documentary, like Leni Riefenstahl's &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. It is, like all of Spielberg's work, supremely manipulative, with outstanding performances by Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson, and an over-the-top, self-righteous performance by Ben Kingsley. The overall product leaves viewers with their emotions not only wrung out, but also strangely compromised, and very few are likely ever to watch it a second time. The medium of entertainment and the message of genuinely righteous anger do not play well together.
B000255LIY|1.0|I try to evaluate a movie like this on two sets of criteria: 1. Is it a good adaptation? and 2. Is it a good movie, in and of itself?<br /><br />The answer to both questions, in this case, is no. The original movie's dialogue was delivered with such impecible timing and sarcastic, sharp wit that you could actually believe these folks WERE Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The onscreen chemistry between Peter O'Toole and Catharine Hepburn was off the charts, and the supporting cast, including a very young Anthony Hopkins, was superb.<br /><br />In this remake, Patrick Stewart (who I always regarded as a great actor) and Glen Close (who I never did) seem to have about as much interest in their dialogue as a toddler in a calculus class. They sound so scripted and deadpan that it's hard to believe they weren't actually reading off of cue cards (perhaps they were). They barely, as far as I could tell, even make eye contact with one another.<br /><br />Disappointing all around.
B0000JCFPE|1.0|&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; is worth a few words as being possibly the worst popular movie ever made and marketed in the good ole U.S. of A.(it's significantly worse than &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;). Why?<BR>There isn't one, microparticular hint of human kindness anywhere in this production - and that's the definition of porn, which provides, at best, the cheap thrill of refined sugar. One hopes for an accidental, peripheral detail of someone waving to a friend, a dog tentatively wagging its tail once or twice; the shadow of a smile on someone's face in a bus window - but no. It's our duty as consumers to be unhappy: let's get on with it.
B000022TSW|2.0|I'm a big fan of South Park, and in my opinion, the tv show is still going strong in season 8. However, I honestly think that the movie version, released in 1999, is probably the worst &quot;episode&quot; ever. For one thing, the plot is simply bizarre: Kyle's mother starts a war against Canada due to a misguided effort to clamp down on obscenity. An interesting, if silly idea, but it just doesn't work as a movie. In fact, it's obvious that Trey Parker and Matt Stone didn't have enough material for a full-length movie, which is why they padded every scene possible with lame songs. (Obstensibly, the songs are paraodies of other well-known musical numbers...fine. However, the songs themselves aren't particularly good on their own merits, and I found them barely amusing.) <br />  <br /> I mean, really the whole movie is dumb. Yeah, there's a lot more swearing and obsenity, but none of the clever ideas or outrageous satire of the best shows with the exception of the love-hate relationship between Satan and Sadaam, which is actually rather topical given the War in Iraq.  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|I thought I'd just add that prior to viewing \\"50 First Dates\\" on DVD, they were advertising a Seinfeld DVD set slated to \\"be in stores soon\\". I believe it's a \\"Best Of\\", but they didn't specify it in the advertisement. Take what you will from this. All it did was get me excited.
B000286S8S|4.0|I have to agree with most of the reviews I've read, why did they include the live tracks?  The song selections were good for the most part, but the live tracks should have definitely been omitted and replaced by a couple more tracks from Fair Warning or Women and Children First, or Somebody Get Me A Doctor from VH2.  Also, why do they have to split up Eruption and You Really Got Me, that is irritating, and why not include the Intruder intro to (Oh)Pretty Woman, instead they included the intro Strung Out before Not Enough (another song that could have been left off, in my opinion).  I give it 4 stars because it's VH and the songs are great, a few changes and it would have been a perfect compilation.
B00005176F|5.0|If you haven't heard a lot of Blur and want to introduce yourself to their music this is a great CD for you. I cant think of one song that sucks.  It shows what a great band blur is and versatile they are. I don't know why America can't produce talented bands like this.
038551123X|4.0|Here's the deal: a good book writes its own review, triggering sufficient spontaneity to fill the page without reaching for bits of interest; this is one of those books, pushing aside all those mundane summer novels, leaving the reader with a satisfying, &quot;Ah.&quot;<br />The attractively ghoulish protagonist is a sociopath and a murderer, but one with a &quot;conscience&quot;, unfortunately an asset as manufactured as his other feelings. But Dexter does his best, given the circumstances. Brilliant and introspective, Dexter charms from the first page, even while distracted, dismembering his latest victim. What makes Dexter's extra-curricular activity bearable is the reason he kills: Dexter only chooses victims who have perpetrated foul deeds, those who would continue harming innocents if not stopped. To be honest, who hasn't secretly applauded the occasional vigilante who takes justice in his own hands, balancing the scales a bit?<br />Essentially passionless in his pursuit of evil-doers, Dexter is an elegant ghoul, fascinated by blood, the essence of human life. With the self-control of a  recently sated vampire, Dexter is intelligent and thorough in his murderous pursuits. Like Rice's Vampire Lestat, this more human predator has a dark, romantic appeal, his dispassionate regard for &quot;necessary&quot; murders seductive and curiously erotic.<br />Dexter spends his days as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Dade PD, the perfect job for keeping up with current crime scenes and maintaining a cover, not to mention the chance to troll for other deserving victims. Lurking behind his public self, Dexter is as secure as a serial killer can be. Until another killer shows up, perfectly modeling Dexter's MO. Both anxious and intrigued, Dexter scents a challenge, another creature of the night that lives with a Dark Passenger, as he refers to his murdering alter-ego. But Dexter is torn; he covets this newcomer for himself, but has promised to help his half-sister policewoman solve the case in her bid to become a detective.<br />Suddenly events spiral out of control, Dexter's careless insouciance is a thing of the past, as he is pursued by dark dreams and chaotic nightmares. Like Alice in Wonderland lost in a psychedelic trance, Dexter tumbles down the rabbit hole. What he finds is completely unexpected, a twisted, deviant detour into horror, startling the man who has thought himself incapable of shock. One has to wonder about Dexter's powers of self-preservation, whether he is tempting fate and secretly wants to be caught.<br />Lindsay has delivered an inspired mystery, one that demands to be read, in one sitting if possible, the elegant Dexter speaking to the need for justice where often there is none. Can't help but smile at the young man's antics, dancing in the moon-drenched night with his own demons and skirting the edge of mayhem. With infinite grace, the author reaches into the dark heart of each of us, igniting atavistic memory, no doubt with a smile on his face.

B0000029GA|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums ever. If you're one of those &quot;i just listen to the beats&quot; characters, don't bother pickin' this album up. But, if you're a true hip-hop junkie that just wants an album to feel, this is the one. Nas uses his great story-telling ability to take you back to the days when hip-hop was about chill beats mixed with dope rhymes. The amazing thing is, he does it so naturally, that it doesn't sound like a choppy old-school album. This is a true classic that will make you want to kick back with your peeps and reminisce about the good ol' days. If you don't already got this one, it's a must-have for any hip-hop collection.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|Horribly sad, and in the end, just downright depressing.   I have not seen a movie that made me feel this emotionally drained in a long time.   I liked Renee Zellwegger, she deserved that Oscar, but otherwise I just sobbed like a baby through most of it.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|The Bee Gees have always been great performers, but this is their career topping concert. Four decades of songs are showcased here with impeccable harmonies and a first class band. The highlights are the guest appearances whether ala 'Nat King Cole' style or real like Celine Dion. Yup, Franki Valli and a tear-jerking Andy Gibb can be heard here as well as the Celine highlight. There is too much and too little as great songs like, &quot;Nights On Broadway&quot; and &quot;Guilty&quot; are cut short, but the typical 'Bee Gees song medley' and the 'Night Fever/More Than A Woman' segment made up for that. In retrospect, the concert could have had more lighting effects, but, geez, the sound is just so good, you wonder if it really makes a difference. This was a historic event.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie White is a bit strange. She is friendless, her mother is obsessed with worshipping god, and sin, everybody at school harrases her, and to top it all off, she gets asked to the prom by the \\"hottest\\" guy in school, which also happens to be the guy Carrie has \\"special feelings\\" for.<br />Now, when you mix all those things together, do you come to the conclusion that Carrie might be under a lot of pressure? Well sure you do, cause she is. And to her horror, when she and Billy or whoever it is, i forget his name, starts to dance to the school song, a huge bucket of pigs blood is poured on her.<br />Blood, guts, gore...not really, but during the last half hour or so, the violence is pretty strong, not too graphic, but there are some graphic scenes of violence. When a girl gets crushed by a basketball hoop thingy, and when Carries mom gets killed by knifes being stabbed in her. I am sure there are some other ones, but those are the most graphic that i Can remeber right now.<br />Not too sexual, but there are definatly some sexual scenes, after all, this IS stephen king we are talking about, read this book and that will be enough dose of sexuality for you for one day, guarenteed.
B00005JNA2|5.0|I remember catching Before Sunrise on tv a while ago and thinking what an incredible movie it was.  I loved how things were drawn out and how it never cut to a specific scene.  It didn't really seem so much like a movie but a beautiful piece of life. It's a shame that this movie isn't more mainstream, but I guess its' obscurity makes me love it even more.  The ending was easily one of the best endings I've ever seen,  if you like romantic movies, or even if you don't, I'm sure you will love Before Sunset

B00008S2VG|5.0|I only can say that American Life is one of the best Madonnas efforts, maybe you hoped another up-beat album but this time is more introspective in lyrics and music, i think is very mature, the music sometimes is a little dark but all fits perfectly because of the theme in this record. Dont worry, this is not the last Madonnas album, i think it is like she said... it reflects her state of mind so she express this feeling in the album, maybe she took again the mynimalist synth pop into it but with great and awesome arranges in every song! I think she set her free with it and what i way to do it because is simply brilliant! and be prepared because she is planning a new album for the next year with Patrick Leonard and others say with William Orbit and i believe shell gonna shut the mouth of many many people who thought her creativity was finished.<BR>Thumbs up for American Life! and dont judge without a listening.
0679424741|5.0|Carson McCullers did a wonderful job with &quot;The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter&quot;. You can find all the descriptions of the story line elsewhere. I'll simply leave it that you should absolutely include this book on ANY reading list.
B00000JLWW|1.0|this is my opinion should have its own category in the video store.by this i mean it should be under terrible movies that cost to much along with the day after tomorow.I think that this movie really did hit an iceberg and it was only popular because of its stars these stars i must add were not that great they were ok but nothing special.And i would rather shoot myself than hear another person singing my heart will go on.I really do not like this over expensive movie bu5 i suppose that thats just my opinion.
B00008EY9G|5.0|One of the best psychological thrillers made since Jacob's Ladder.  This ensemble cast is perfectly blended to offer the right mix of fresh talent (Amanda Peet and Jake Busey) and seasoned veterans (Ray Liota, Alfred Molina and John Cusak) along with Rebecca DeMornay.  You will be drawn in with the rhythmic poetry recited in the opening scenes and once the story begins at the desert Motel, you are absolutely riveted.  There are key clues throughout to sort of clue you in to the shock at the end, but don't ruin it by talking to others about it!  Watching the director's commentary is helpful on the DVD, explaining odd scenes and intricate story lines to the viewer.  This movie is one you will want to watch more than once or twice.  You get most of the plot only superficially the first time watching, and only on the the second and third go around will you say, &quot;AH HA!  Now this makes sense!&quot;  IDENTITY is also John Cusak's tour de force, a superb job here in a performance you will not soon forget.  Top notch entertainment.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I own and love all of the 3 slipknot CD's out. This is the real side of Slipknot. Sure their isn't a parental Advisory sticker, or they don't cuss as much in this CD, its because its real...they did not sell out!!!if you know the singer of Slipknot well enough you woould know that his name is Corey and that before coming to Slipknot he was in another band Stone Sour which had a lighter aproach to Metal so please stfu, this is a great CD... My favorite tracks on this CD are: <br /> <br />-Pulse of the Maggots <br />-Duality <br />-The Nameless <br />-Three Nil <br /> <br />& others... <br />
B00005O5CM|4.0|I give the commentary a 5, the movie a 3, which averages out to a 4. First of all, how can they call this a comedy when maybe half the movie is about a murder trial! I don't think being tried for murder is funny. Do you? In my Alabama review, I said that Reese has no comic ability. I am wrong. She is much better in this flick. But, I find the dog to be the best part.
B0000399WI|5.0|Well what can I say about this modern day classic that hasn't been told already. It seems that most of us who have been lucky enough to watch this gem have been profoundly moved by this story. Not hearing anything about the release of this film in '96, I rented this out without any idea what to expect, other than it was a prison drama. Now I love prison flicks and my favourites are Brubaker, Birdman of Alcatrez and Stir Crazy, but after watching Shawshank Redemption I can say this is one of the best films ever made, and one of the very few movies that made me cry, and it takes a lot for me to shed a tear. I think the last time I cried was at my grandpas funeral, but that was a different emotion to the one I felt watching the Shawshank Redemption. The ending was filled with a great deal of satisfaction and hope that you rarely get in any film today. If you want to watch a film that has a story that covers human survival, struggle, bonding and hope and want to be uplifted than this is the one to watch.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I absolutely adore this album!!! It's so dramatic and theaterical that you just find yourself wrapped up in this intriguing world Wainwright creates... and you never want to leave. All the tracks have their own flavor- especially refreshing in a world of Dashboard Confessions where all the cuts have the same sound. I wouldn't say it's better necessarily than &quot;Poses&quot;- it has a completely different vibe to it. In any case, love it and I've been cemented in as a permenant Rufus Wainwright fan. My favortie tracks are &quot;O What a World&quot; and &quot;14th Street&quot;.
B00005JM02|1.0|If I sit through Finding Nemo ever again, I swear I will shoot myself.<br />It is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, with jokes that lead nowhere.<br />Althought the animation was pretty good, a cutsie aspect was terrible and pretty unbelievable.<br />Monsters Inc was better for the kids and adluts.<br />Im sick and tired of people saying that Finding Nemo is the best Disney....ARE THEY FORGETTING THE LION KING and other classic such as Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and Sleeping Beauty.

0792153189|1.0|We have here a movie that epitomizes everything that is wrong with Hollywood movies: sickening sentimentality, gung-ho patriotic drivel, the completely telegraphed happy ending, and such a persistent effort to be as PC as possible that it paradoxically becomes stereotypical.  Did I mention the bad acting and dialogue and the stupid plot?  What is with these 'saving the world at the last possible second' movies?  Please, can we rub out the disaster movie forever?  If I see another bad actor outrunning a fireball, tidal wave, or tornado I'm going to smash my TV set.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|There's not much more to say about this album that hasn't been said already. It's fabulous. It's brillantly written and performed. I listen to it in the car, at work, at home. It's absolutely in my top five favorite LPs of all time. My favorite tracks are &quot;Greek Song&quot;, &quot;Poses&quot;, and &quot;Rebel Prince&quot;.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I saw the stage show of Annie, with my friend ******* as Grace, and she was fantastic. It bought a tear to my eye when she sang I THINK IM GOING TO LIKE IT HERE. This version however, needed my friend in it! All the cast were terrible, except for Ms Hannigan...who pulled a stunning performance.<BR>That red head girl...well, lets just say that it sounds like a rat crawled down her throat and died.
B00028HBKC|4.0|i'm not going to say this is the best movie i have ever seen. I won't even say that it was really good. But i will tell you that this movie made me more completely understand my Christianity. Sure, the violence was probably in excess, and there are some extremely gruesome scenes that probably could have been edited out. But when I walked out of that theater, my eyes red from crying, I was really glad that I went to see it because it made me want to be a better and more religious person, and it made me want to kneel down and pray right then and there and thank the Lord for all the suffering and pain he has gone through so we could be here. So, in the long run, the movie is ok but the feelings it provokes, the way it inspires your faith, that is what is important. That is why i think this is a must see film for christians everywhere.
B000002LVB|3.0|After listening to their previous three records, I was glad to finally hear this album as part of the Peel Slowly box set. It certainly isn't inoffensive; now matter how commercial the Velvets ever got, that adjective is not something that would describe them. But it is somewhat neutered. Not because of new drummer Billy Yule, who is far better than Moe Tucker, by the way, but simply the album doesn't have enough strong songs and lackluster production. <br />I needn't restate what virtually every other reviewer has said: &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock 'n Roll&quot; are classics. 'Nuff said. &quot;Cool it Down,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill,&quot; and &quot;I Found a Reason&quot; are very underrated tunes in the VU cannon. &quot;New Age,&quot; &quot;Who Loves the Sun,&quot; and &quot;Oh!Sweet Nuthin'&quot; are good, but rather overrated. &quot;Train 'Round the Bend&quot; and &quot;Head Held High&quot; are mediocre throwaways. <br />Overall, a listenable album with two stone cold classics (&quot;Sweet Jane&quot; sounds even better on the Peel Slowly box set in its full-length version) and a few other good tunes. But it's not a rock 'n roll classic.
B000000WCV|4.0|When I bought this album I listened to it and was amazed. I love the songs on this album. Here is a list on a scale 1 to 10.<br />Daftendirekt-10/10 (Solid beginning, nice beat.)<BR>WDPK 83.7 FM- 8/10 (Sounds good, a little short but good.)<BR>Revolution 909- 10/10 (Awesome song. Like the beat.)<BR>Da Funk-     10/10 (Excellent. This is probably the best.)<BR>Phoenix-      9/10 (I like it, but it can't beat the others.)<BR>Fresh-        9/10 (Like Phoenix, good but doesn't get 10.)<BR>Around the World-10/10 (One of the best, it gets stuck in my head all the time, even after not listening to it for awhile, iy always finds it's way back inside my head.)<BR>Rollin' & Scratchin'-8/10 (Some people say this one bites the dust, but I say it's only for the true DJ. I like the scratching, but this one is a little too long. Solid 8.)<BR>Teachers- 6/10 (It was hard to rate this one. After listening to it over and over, I decided that the background sounds together deserved a 9, but the weird voices drops it 3. Still trying to get used to this one.)<BR>High Fidelity- 8/10 (I liked this one, but I don't know what it is, this is just a little bit less than the rest.)<BR>Rock & Roll- 8/10 (This is another one that goes a little unliked. I would say that is because it's a little too long, and a little repeative, like Rollin' & Scratchin'. I still liked it though, but it is a little long.)<BR>Oh Yeah- 8/10 (I like the beat of this one, but those kids saying \\"Oh Yeah\\" brings it a down a couple points. I still like this one though.)<BR>Burnin'- 7/10 (I like it, but it just doesn't quite have what the others have, so I give it a 7.)<BR>Indo Silver Club- 9/10 (I love this one. Not exactly a 10, but it's close. Great for dance clubs.)<BR>Alive- 10/10 (Cool song, it sounds good too like the other 10's.)<BR>Funk Ad- 10/10 (Great way to end the album, this album starts you off with some funky ones and ends you with it too.)<br />Overall:<BR>I really liked this album. I usually listen to this one when I'm sitting around doing nothing, or (like the album's name states) doing homework. I usually like listening to music that people dance to at clubs with some dj and techno. Two other Daft Punk Albums I would recommend which I own are Discovery and Daft Club. The overall grade for this album would be an 8.5. Most of the album is awesome but there is always those one or two songs that always have an effect on the album. This is from Daft Punk's earlier years, but I still say this one is really good.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT was one of the greatest movies on earth.  I hear a lot of Ashton Kutcher with everybody talking about him, I thought he would wreck this movie up A LOT, but man was I WRONG.  Ashton plays the part of Evan in the movie.  As a kid he had many interesting moments and had blackouts.  So his doctor told him to write in a journal each night about that day.  Ever since he became older, or an adult, he had the journals, and everytime he became in a bad moment, he read the journals which sucked him up back to that time to change it, and as he was older things have been going wrong.....I don't want to spoil all of the movie for you but you MUST buy this movie if you are into action and drama like this.  I would rate this movie a 100 out of 5, it was one of the best movies on earth!!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|This spirited album by Muse makes me pine so much for Radiohead circa '95-97, those years prior to the latter band's corruption via Kid A.  Anyway, Muse rock with a vitality and an energy not common to many contemporary bands--just check out the emotive, wailing &quot;Time is Running Out&quot; for proof of what Radiohead, Wilco, and others have eschewed in favor of supposedly &quot;nobler&quot; musical pursuits.  &quot;Absolution&quot; will not save the world, it will not make us view post-modernism in a different light, it will not deconstruct recorded sound--but it will provide for an exciting, enthralling, and ultimately rewarding listen.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I'd rate this with 10 stars if the option were given! I bought this a couple of months ago, and I already know it's one of the essential CDs I'd want with me on a marooned island. Arrangements, chords and Diana's sultry voice weave a fabric of lush richness. Melancholy and perfect. Such music fine-tunes good emotions and will warmly greet you when you're sad. Some music I love for it's energy and novelty, but they don't necessarily possess high repeat-listenability as does this; high praise indeed. Good musical endings are a lost art; I find the way several of these tracks trail off leave me so tranquil that I turn off the sound source and savor the gentle, heart-felt ambience for a moment before resuming. My other discovery is When I Look In Your Eyes. You're spoiling me, Diana.
0446310786|5.0|I taught this book to eighth graders seventeen times and never got sick of it. Why do I love this book? Let me count the ways:<br /><br /> 1. The protagonist, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, is such a great character Demi Moore named one of her daughters after her.<br /> She's funny, smart, and she's got a stronger will than Catherine the Great. Atticus, Scout's father, is almost as compelling. He is willing to defend a black man accused of rape, despite living in racist, depression-era Maycomb, Alabama.<br /><br /> 2. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great story we can all identify with. How many of us have known a weird neighbor who refuses to come out of the house? The first part of the book follows Scout and her brother Jem as they try to get a look at \\"Boo\\" Radley. The second half involves Tom Robinson's rape trial and its aftermath.<br /><br /> 3. The book is simply teeming with great vignettes. Jem and Scout are ashamed of Atticus because he doesn't play football, until he shoots down a rabid dog with one shot. Miss Maudie Atkinson's house burns down. Jack, Atticus's brother, makes Scout laugh and is able to painlessly pull a sliver from her hand. The Footwashing Baptists come to town for the rape trial. There are dozens more.<br /><br /> 4. The minor characters are simply wonderful. There are over a hundred (I know because I had my students count them). X-Billups has three sets of teeth. Aunt Alexandra tries to make Scout act like a lady. Cecil Jacobs gets into a fistfight with Scout. Dill, Jem and Scout's neighbor boy develops a crush on Scout and asks her to marry him. Calpurnia, Atticus's housekeeper, acts as a surrogate mother to the children. Bob Ewell rivals Simon Legree as a villain. They're all so real you'll want to visit Maycomb to see if they're still alive. Too bad it's a fictional town.<br /><br /> 5. Many lessons are learned, the most important of which is \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" Mayella Ewell, who accuses Tom Robinson of rape, is actually a sympathetic character. The town's social structure condemns her to a life of drudgery and she grasps at straws. Mrs. Dubois, the old woman down the street from the Finches, who calls Atticus a racial slur, dies brave, refusing to take her medication because she wants to die clean.<br /><br /> This book doesn't get enough credit; it's rarely listed as a masterpiece of the twentieth century. A masterpiece wouldn't be so easy to read. Certainly it's taught in just about every junior high in the country, but it wasn't written for teenagers. The book is a flashback, told by Scout as a grown woman; she uses New York Times' syntax, not S.E. Hinton's.<br /><br /> Some of my students rented the movie instead of reading it page by page. Big mistake. Not only did they fail the test, but they failed themselves by missing out on the best book they'd ever read.structure condemns her to a life of drudgery and she grasps at straws.

B0001MDP3G|5.0|Very well done. A portrayal of LIFE during the Civil War. This is not another civil war movie. If your looking for that you will be disappointed. This is about what a man and a women, and a community struggle thru during the war years - survival, stamina, evil, human spirit; even a good time or two. Yes guys, a love story as well. But my guy liked the movie too. Be prepaired for a good cry, and a not happy ending. The war did not end happy for most folks, it just thankfully ended, and folks moved on. This movie reflects that. If you have read the book you will be pleased with the movie.
B0000048CP|5.0|This is one of Bathorys best. As well it marks a turnig point in Bathory's career. Bathory is one first Black Metal bands and on this album Quorthon has some the best Black Metal vocals to this day. This is still is better then a lot of the Black Metal of today. This also marks the turning point Bathory's career To when Bathory went on with the viking theme With Hammerheart. Which is good but not as good as Blood Fire Death in my mind. <br />R.I.P. Quorthon, may you reach Valhalla
B00027JYLC|5.0|I recommend all movie watchers to buy this movie! its a great movie! the actors playing &quot;freaks&quot; in this movie have given it its reputation as being disturbing, but the idea behind this movie in the first place is how &quot;freaks&quot; are just like any other people and you can't just hurt them and get away with it. You can't find another movie like this! Its one of kind and very well made and really sends a message across! Even if you're not a fan of black and white, check it out anyway, the color hardly affects the impact of this movie on you.
0060934913|5.0|If Bourdain cooks even half as well as he writes, I'd sit at his table any day. This book and &quot;Cook's Tour&quot; were so delightful, I truly hated to finish them. He writes with wonderfully wry humor yet he's endearingly self-depracating. He tells compelling stories, isn't afraid to speak his mind (but is NEVER strident), and just writes the most entertaining tales you could ever want to read. This book could have been a nasty expose but instead, it is a rollicking good time. BRAVO ANTHONY BOURDAIN!!!!
B00024BHTC|5.0|Hey, I wonder if this guy has anything better to do...  I bet this one &quot;*&quot; star person is the same guy for every lame review.  Can't you use another line besides &quot;total and utter crap&quot;?  Stop changing where you're from because we know it's you.  Get a life will you!!  Write lame reviews for Clay Aiken or something. <br />Nightwish's Once is a great album! (IMHO)
B00028HBKM|5.0|What an impact this movie has had... Yes, it is true, the movie is very graphic and depicts in excrutiating and accurate detail the suffering Christ endured. He was crucified and the movie realistically portrays what that was -&gt;&gt; probably the worst possible way to die that man could ever dream up. This type of punishment/execution really and truly was carried out. Mel Gibson didn't just make it up for shock value. <br />  <br /> I believe that Mel Gibson's intention was to attempt to deliver a wake-up call to anyone ready to listen by putting the uncensored story out there: an in-your-face, no-holds-barred depiction to remind us of the sacrifice Christ made for all of mankind. I'm sure there are countless ways the last twelve hours of Christ's life could have been recounted. In my opinion, I think Mel Gibson was trying to make an impact simply by illustrating what ACTUALLY happened, even at the risk of possibly offending some people.  <br />  <br /> I know that after I saw it I felt a strong need to reconnect with my faith and have done so. The movie also helps to put into perspective the &quot;crosses&quot; every-day people bear. If Christ could get through that hell-on-earth without complaint or question or submission, we should all try a little harder to deal with our daily struggles in a humble way. <br />  <br /> I truly don't mean to preach (because I am by no means qualified to do so), but I get tired of all the negative press. To each his own, but I think it is hard to ignore all the good the release of this movie has done (people coming back to God, others converting to Christianity, and even those who confessed to committing crimes after seeing it). What an act of worship and witnessing by Mel Gibson. Well done. I am so grateful he overcame so many obstacles to release this very important film as his personal tribute to Jesus Christ. You have to admire him for that...
B0000399WI|4.0|Whoever wrote the following review, I've got to hand it to you for almost pulling my leg.  This is funny stuff, I actually thought you were serious at first.  I'm sure they're many ninnies who will put their DVD copy in now and think there's something wrong.  Keep it up.<br />Anyhoo, The Shawshank Redemption is a great piece of work.  Better on DVD than in the theaters (unless you get to take that special someone to the last row &lt;wink wink&gt;.  Buy it if your internet connection just happens to be down.  Of course that last statement was a joke.<br />---<br />My third submission on this, if you are doubtful, check for yourself. I own the VHS of Shawshank. I recently purchased a DVD player and Shawshank was one of my first disks. I set both the disk and the tape up to play simultaneously, and flipped back and forth to compare the superb quality improvement of DVD. I was in for a surprise. The picture DOES NOT get wider-AS IT SHOULD-and the top and bottom of the picture of the DVD version are ERASED and replaced by the black bars. The other movie I found with this flaw is Jackie Brown. Check out the point where Bridget Fonda &quot;services&quot; Robert DeNiro. On the VHS widescreen version , her &quot;buns&quot; disappear. They are fully visable on the fullscreen version! The top and bottom have been erased on the widescreen version and the picture does not get any wider. I suspect more movies have this flaw. Now that we know what to look for, let's look!<br />---
0142800821|3.0|Now, I'm as much of a stickler for proper grammar as anyone, but I have to admit to being more than a little disturbed by Truss's (her usage of the possessive apostrophe) guide to punctuation. <br />  <br /> I applaud Truss for putting a cardboard apostrophe on a stick and going to stand outside a movie theatre to correct the spelling of the movie 'Two Weeks Notice'. (There would be an apostrophe if the title was 'One Week's Notice'...why'd it go away with the addition of an extra week?) I'm all for some of her comments that a lot of punctuation depends on who taught it to you in the first place -- whether or not you use the Oxford comma (which would make the title of the book Eats, Shoots, and Leaves) is one of them. But some of the comments Truss makes in passing would make even the most hardened grammarian shift uneasily in his or her seat. <br />  <br /> The one that bothered me most involved an incident from Truss's early teenage years, a recollection of a letter she received from a pen friend in America: the unfortunate Kerry-Anne. Kerry-Anne, an eighth-grade girl from Detroit, had made the grave error in judgement to write to Truss on 'pink paper, with carefree spelling errors -- and where the dots over the I's ought to be, there were _bubbles_' (104).  <br />  <br /> Oh, do pardon me whilst I ring for my smelling salts.  <br />  <br /> In any case, Truss recalls that she immediately turned around and wrote back to Kerry-Anne on 'grown-up deckled green paper with a fountain pen....I deliberately dropped the word &quot;desultory&quot;, and I think I may even have used some French'. Essentially, she did her best to 'blast Kerry-Anne out of the water'. Though Truss claims that she now feels ashamed of her actions back then, I don't really get a sense that she's ashamed of it at all. And what sort of person gloats (however minimally) years after the fact about dealing out a literary smack-down to a twelve-year-old American pen friend? If that's a 'zero-tolerance'approach, then it smacks of the draconian rules at my old grammar school that prevented students from bringing cough drops to school if they had a cold. <br />  <br /> If you manage to put the author's personality aside, the book does have its good points. It clarified a few questions I had regarding when to use colons and when to use semi-colons. It's relatively approachable, and Truss gives plenty of examples to illustrate her points. But frankly, if you're looking for a grammar/punctuation/style guide that keeps the author's sordid past out of its text, you'd be better off looking at the bibliography in the back of the book and getting your hands on copies of the books that Truss consults as her source material. <br />  <br /> Of course, it should be said that if you use American-style punctuation (the Oxford comma is a prime example of a punctuation style that's far more common in American usage), I'm afraid that you're on your own. To the best of my knowledge, the US printed edition of Eats, Shoots and Leaves hasn't been edited for a US audience. And that, to me, is the saddest thing of all.

B00007KMOX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber, who died aged 74 on July 13th 2004, was the most exciting and frustrating conductor. An acknowledged genius, admired to the point of reverence by such different personalities as Herbert von Karajan and Claudio Abbado, whenever he lifted his baton (which happened rarely enough, no matter what he was promised - unlimited rehearsals, any ammount of money), something greater than music happened.<br /><br />Even more rarely did he venture into the recording studio. Again: whenever he did, something special came about. His legendary recording of the 5th (and also the 7th) is almost unanimously considered the greatest 5th ever recorded. All others must be measured by it, none can pass this test. (That's not to say that there aren't equally accomplished 5ths out there by now, or that another approach might be more to one's personal liking.) Kleiber 'did' rhythm as well and better than, say, Mengelberg - his grasp on texture was firmer even than Karajan's - his sense of musical architecture exceeds that of Karl Boehm. No conductor had his uncanny ability to end a piece. The shy, gratuitously difficult, perhaps somewhat autistic, sometimes abrasive, sometimes witty Kleiber, never recorded a work that could not feasibly be the best recording of the particular piece he chose (his repertoire--although not his knowledge of scores--was painfully narrow - LvB 5th, Brahms 2nd, Schubert 3rd, Tristan, La Traviata, Der Rosenkavalier, Die Fledermaus...).<br /><br />None, however, have reached the undisputed status of this one. In its third life as a SACD, it will continue to outshine, outsell, outlive all other rivals. Forget--if just for the moment--'historically informed', forget discussions about tempo... under Kleiber this work is everything you can imagine it to be, and all along it will always sound 'just right'. Never forced, never wilful, there is not a hint of 'interpretation' - just music at its most frightening, at its most beautiful, lyrical...<br /><br />Enjoy!oy!

0520215842|4.0|Since I am a novice in the realm of Chinese history, I felt that the abridged version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms would be a better starting point to satiate my appetite that has been whetted by various video games. I find this odd, since I've always lived by the rule of never reading abridged versions, and never buying greatest hits albums. I wouldn't say disappointment settled in, but when reading such a story of chivalry, honor, and valor, you don't want the beautiful writing to end. But then it did. Needless to say, I was left wanting.  <br /> <br />Moss Roberts is a poet, no doubt. The language he uses in translation would make this a great work no matter what the age. Essentially, Three Kingdoms is the abridged version of about 90 years of Chinese history chronicling the fall of the Han Empire, the splintering into Three Kingdoms; Wei, Shu, and Wu; and the rise of Wei to prominence. It deals with betrayal, honor, strategy, and respect. And if you can read this, and not have Zhao Zhilong (Yun) be your favorite character, you are a better person than I. His abilities are outstanding.  <br /> <br />This is an abridged version (4th time I've said that... Theme?) so you're getting a taste. The original work is 4 volumes and in excess of 2400 pages, this is a hair over 400, so you see what you're getting. I'm about to tackle the original, I've got to get through my Sophocles first, though, and I'll let you know how much better that is. If you're at all interested in Medieval Chinese History, consider this a jumping off point, the chocolaty exterior before the creamy filling.
B000002C1W|4.0|Many people say of this album, &quot;Good, but not Pink Floyd.&quot;  To them I say that Pink Floyd, if anything was a band that was constantly on the move and changed its sound from album to album.  This album isn't any less Pink Floyd than Saucerful of Secrets, or Obscured by Clouds; both of which differ from this recording as well as each other quite a bit.  <br />To those of you not concerned with whether this album is like other Pink Floyd albums, consider the music itself.  This album was made in the 80's and it shows.  Gilmour and company (minus Waters for the first time) experiment as many bands did with synthesisers and synth drums.  The effect is distracting and umpleasant if you hate, hate, hate 80's music.<br />I, Myself, felt this at first, but the music itself is strong enough that soon, I listened beyond the 80's plastic sound and heard the songs themselves.  The music here is as good as any that came before it, although maybe not as complex lyrically.  Gone also is the dark broodiness that Waters brought to the table, but David Gilmour has a much more clear and pleasant singing voice than Waters.  If you liked Gilmour's previous vocal performances (such as Comfortably Numb and Wish You Were Here) you will like this music. <br />For those of you who have listened to and like this album, I highly suggest The Divison Bell and both of Gilmour's solo albums if you can find them.
0345423496|2.0|After reading this book, I decided to read through 2001 and 2010, then never got around to 2061.  On the plus side, just watching the movies is enough for you to know what's going on.  Plus, there is at least one entire chapter lifted from 2010, and multiple references back to the other books, so you in no way need to read the other books to know what's going on.  On the other hand, there's an entire chapter lifted from 2010, and several other instances where entire sections were pasted in from his previous books.  Yes, I listed that as a plus, but I also definitely felt a bit short changed by the fact that Clarke had basicaly padded the book by cutting and pasting from previous works.    Also, as somewhat of a nitpicker for details, I picked up on multiple instances of continuity problems between this book and the rest of the series.  Clarke timeshifts events in 2001 A Space Odyssey forward several more years to apparently try to maintain some continuity with real life technology.  Yet this is a horrible thing to do, considering that he named the books after the years they take place in.  There are also a number of other events that take place in the previous books that are altered so as to better fit with the plot in 3001.  In reality, it's almost better if you read 3001 as a stand alone book, as if you read it as part of the series, you'll end up scratching your head over the constantly changing details.    It is, however, a facinating view on how far (or how little) we'll have come in 1,000 years.  And you do get an explanation behind what the Monoliths are really there for.  But once I got past the
B00005JKC3|1.0|I saw this movie @ my cousin's and I thought it was gonna be so good.  I love comic book movies so I was expecting something excellent.  I thought this movie was a waste.  It just totally sucked.  I wouldn't buy this @ all.  If you wanna see it, go out and rent it or borrow it.  It's not worth spending your money on actually buying it
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|I was quite surprised at how bad this movie was. Perhaps it was just me, but I was looking forward to a Unforgiven-type directoral masterpiece from Mr. Eastwood and the stars Robbins and Penn. Given the hype this movie recieved (and the oscar nods to its 2 main stars and director Eastwood) I was really ready to sink my viewing teeth into something substantial.<br />Unfortunately, this movie was as stale as a bag of month-old potato chips. I never really came to symphathize at all with Sean Penn's character, even though his daughter was murdered. I mean, seriously, how can you symphathize with a criminal (Penn's character) who barely was involved in his kid's life to begin with?<br />Perhaps if the movie had shown a more deeper relationship between Penn and the kid then I could have cared more about the outcome. As it was all my sympathy went to Tim Robbins character, sexually molested as a child and then basically forgotten by his so-called \\"buddies\\". In my opinion Tim Robbins is the only reason to watch this movie. He walks around with an aire of utter hopelessness (reminiscent of the character he played in Jacob's Ladder), and yet he tries so hard to get passed the mental anguish of his past and make it through each day as an adult that by the end you are cheering for him.<br />Which brings me to the other reason why this movie stinks - the ending.<br />Like in a good novel, the reader/viewer doesn't want to be cheated in the end. I don't want to give away the ending, but be warned - it stinks.<br />All in all there really wasn't any substance to most of the characters, and I found myself toward the end wondering why I should even finish watching it. I like to be absorbed by characters played with heart and substance. Watching these jokers (except for Robbins) was like watching carboard cutouts being moved around on a stage.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This the finest live double album of all time, better than the Allman bros Fillmore album. Every time I listen, I am so over come by the sheer beauty of it, I get tears down my cheeks. Stevie Nicks, eat your heart out, THIS, is the voice of an angel. The band, what can I say that already has been said, the best. There is none better in this world than Jerry Douglas, none. The crowd, I have no problem with them, I envy them, listen  in the pauses in the softer songs, not a sound, they are taking in all these wonderful sounds and then exploding in joy when they are over, lucky people. I am now going to add to my Alison Krauss collection.
B00008D1NF|3.0|Together, Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown and Arnaldo Antunes, three of the best artists of the MPB. One Album, 13 songs. When I finished listening all the songs, I was deceptionated. 13 songs, and, apart from &quot;Ja Sei Namorar&quot; and &quot;Velha Infancia&quot;, no other really atracted me. Ok, &quot;Passe em Casa&quot;, &quot;E Voce&quot; and &quot;Carnavalia&quot; were other good music, but the other songs appeared to me that they made quickly only to fill the rest of the CD.<BR>   Tribalistas is a good CD, but I am still thinking that hear the old songs of Marisa Monte is better. However, take it if you really like Brazilian music or like any of the three musicians, you won't be deceptionated, even because &quot;Ja Sei Namorar&quot; and &quot;Velha Infancia&quot; are excellent songs and does not let the CD to be a complete waste of time.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I loved all the special effects and the storyline with Bobby (Iceman) and Rogue.  I thought they were so cute together.  Nightcrawler's a great edition to the X-Men team but I felt bad for Scott (Cyclops) and Logan (Wolverine) when Jean turned into the Phoenix.  I can't wait until X-Men 3.
B000255LIY|4.0|I have not seen the first version of this film done in 1968 and from what I've heard the newer version does not match up at all. However, watching the film was a very enjoyable experience. I picked this film up because it has Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the King of France in it- he does a stunning job as do all the actors. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first purchased this DVD but I was very pleased. I was pleased with the work the actors did and the dialouge (which was very dry and bitter humour). It is a long film and at the last 3 or 5 scenes my patience with the film had waned and I was longing for it to be over. Though it is good, it is by no means astounding. Overall, I'd say watch this one on a rainy Sunday but I wouldn't rush out to buy it unless you are (like me) a tremendous fan of one of the actors in this film.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Brainwashed was to be George Harrison`s last album. He was working on it till close to his death in November 2001. It was finished and co-priduced by friend and producer Jeff Lynne, and the sound is quite similar to their previous collaborations in the Travelling Wilburys and George`s `Cloud Nine` album. George`s son Dhani also played a big part on the album.<br /><br />  Even though it is sad that George is no longer among us, it is actually a very uplifting album. Many of the songs are on level with George`s very best work. Lyrically it`s a very moving and mature album.<br /><br />  The optimistic `Any Road` opens the albums and set the mood from the beginning. Great catchy country tune with George on his charateristic slide guitar.<br /><br />  `P2 Vatican Blues` sounds a lot like a Wilbury song; also a very good track.<br /><br />  `Pisces Fish` is an outstanding song; great melody with thoughful lyrics. Somehow it reminds me of Donovan at his best.<br /><br />  `Looking For My Life` in spite of the upbeat tune, this is George looking back well aware that he may not have so many days left to live.<br /><br />  Songs 5-9 are all good songs, though not outstanding by Harrison`s standards<br /><br />  `Marwa Blues` is a quiet instrumental<br /><br />  The charming `Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea` featuring George on ukulele and Jools Holland om piano is the next highlight.<br /><br />  `Rocking Chair in Hawaii` is blues-song and a little atypical for George, but a fine track too.<br /><br />  The finale and title track is by far the most complex track. George`s inspiration from Indian culture and music shines through here; lyrically George comments on how everybody claims to have all the answers, and how it`s often hard to think for yourself about what really matters in life.<br /><br />  This clearly one of Harrison`s best albums; maybe only second to `All Things Must Pass`.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This was an empowering film to me.  I loved how Julia Roberts' character, Katherine Watson, challenged these women into different ways of thinking.  She helped them all to see what potential they have and that they didn't have to fit a binary of a woman in the 50s.  Watson challenged every idea that these women were brought up with: the ideas that a woman's role was to serve her husband and keep house and home.  Watson was a teacher ahead of her time and the fact that Julia Roberts played her character allowed Watson to come alive for me.  This film was excellent and very well done.
B000089RVX|1.0|This is absoulutely the worst album and quite possibly the worst band ever. This Amy Lee chick sounds like she's dying when she sings. It's sad that so many people can actually call this rock I mean, this is a cd I would buy just to crack it. I can't believe so many people like this crap, I'll tell you what real rock is, try Linkin Park, Metallica, Korn, stuff like that. About the only thing I can say good about this band is that Amy Lee is hot. Honestly the most annoying part about this band is that people can actually call this rock. I don't mean to sound sexist but, girls and hard rock, they just don't mix. Sorry ladies. If it was possible I would give this album less then 1 star but this rating thing don't go into negatives. If you feel depressed and want to hurt yourself in some way but this album and listen to it, otherwise don't even bother.
B000099T2L|3.0|The album was ok, I thought it was gonna be better.  I like a few of the songs and thought they were well written but I expected something huge.  She's a great artist,performer,singer,and person.  She deserves all the grammys and success that God can bless her with but this album was a little disappointing to me.
B000002UB3|5.0|I was 11 when this album came out, and have loved it since. The Fab four were rockin' on all cylinders when they bade farewell with this one. The vocal harmonies were at their best, and Paul's power was right on in OH Darling.  Paul's fancy bass work was never more evident than in &quot;I Want You&quot;.  This will always be my favorite album, so much so, that in my will I have stated that if I should &quot;go out&quot; naturally,  that this album should be played at the time I reach Golden Slumbers.  Not kidding........Miss you guys!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Ok so I usually read these things, trying to base my purchase with the rating systems. But when I check up on one of my favorite albums and saw that there were only four stars. I had to speak up, this album has everything you want and need. If you like Jaz with a little rap in it you have it, if you like Indie music with a little rap in it you have it, if you like Alternative with a little rap in it you have it.<br />I also must say that if you need an album with great bass this cd has it. I love this cd and it has been in my car blasting itself away through the highways of Montreal. So stop reading this crappy review and purchase it. I guarantee you are going to like this album. ;)
B00028HBKM|4.0|When seeing this movie in the theater, my first thoughts about the DVD were getting Mel Gibson's explaination of some of the symbolism expressed throughout the movie. The director's commentary will be very interesting. <br /> <br />
1558216847|4.0|There have have been questions about the truth od this book. What rings true is the deep emotional turmoil of the author as he hangs on to his hatred for his tormentors, and there's no doubt thess dark passions helped spur him on during his long and often seeminly endless trek. It's a sad book. An amazing journey of the mind and the soul can be found in IN THE GHOST COUNTRY by Peter Hillary, a mind-bending account of his haunted journey to the South Pole. Deep stuff.

B0001HAHXW|5.0|In the beginning, there was Robert Johnson. And he was great. He wrote some of the tastiest blues songs ever put down on  tape.<br />In the sixties, Eric Clapton rose to guitar divinity with John Mayall and a band named 'Cream. He became one of the most respected in a long line of guitar hero's.<br />Me and Mr. Johnson is Clapton's homage to his mentor. It is a reworking of the primitive original delta sound of Robert Johnson into the smoother interpretations of ERic Clapton. But the result is, in my opinion, the best Eric Clapton album since From The Cradle.<br />This album will grow on you. Listen to it at least five times before you make up your mind.<br />It is, in its own way, a masterpiece. Traveling Riverside Blues and Milkcow Blues are especially delightful.
B000286S8S|4.0|First off, I have to say that this 2-Disc compilation was sorely needed and is a huge step forward from the single-disc Best of Van Halen Vol. 1 from 1996. Also, the music here is awesome. Van Halen is one of the best hard rock bands in the world & the amount of hit songs they had from 2 different lead singers is staggering (thankfully, there are no Gary Cherone/VH3 tracks represented in this collection). Enough of the praise, let's get down to the Amazon tradition of bashing Best Of compilations. I think VH missed a golden opportunity to make a double CD with Disc 1 dedicated to the David Lee Roth Era & Disc 2 dedicated to the Sammy Hagar years. Did we really need 3 new songs? I think at least 1 could have been cut. Did we really need 3 live songs? Definitely not due to the fact that the studio versions are already represented & who needs to hear Sammy singing these classic Dave tracks? They should have left off these live tracks & moved the 4 songs at the end of Disc 1 (from 5150) to Disc 2 & added &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (the only glaring Sammy missing song in place of one of the new songs. In the place of the 4 songs moved from Disc 1, I would have added these great absent Dave songs: &quot;Mean Street&quot; & &quot;So This Is Love&quot; from the under-represented Fair Warning ablum, &quot;Where Have All The Good Times Gone&quot; from Diver Down and &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; from Van Halen I. All in all, this is a great collection of music and a perfect starting point for VH newbies. I would have made the aforemetioned changes to earn a 5th star, but you can't always have your cake and eat it too.
B000000W5B|5.0|Goat's Head Soup was originally released Aug 31, 1973 and went to #1 in both the US and the UK.  I have found it quite rewarding that over the years this one has gained respect and continues to appear in many rankings of greatest rock albums.  Personally, I've always like this one a lot.  It's got the usual megahits; Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker), Angie, and Star#$!@% (a hit as a single in Europe and Japan), an incredible jam in Hide Your Love, great intro in 100 Years Ago, part 2 of the voodoo chronicles in Dancing With Mr. D., solid rocker Silver Train, and oh yeah, Winter, Coming Down Again, and Can You Hear The Music too.  Most people know the music, so in my reviews I try to give you data on the sessions and interesting facts connected with the songs and the album.  Here we go:<br />There were 23 songs recorded during the Goat's Head Soup sessions between Nov 25-30 and Dec 6-21, 1972 at Dynamic Sound Studios in Kingston, Jamaica.  Only 8 of them made it onto Goat's Head Soup.  Keith had made strong connections with the Jamaican reggae musicians and had recently bought a house in Jamaica, so he was the driving force behind the sessions.  The band included Mick Taylor, Nicky Hopkins (piano), Billy Preston (organ), Bobby Keys (sax), Chuck Finley (trumpet), Jim Horn (horn), and of course Ian Stewart on piano.  Sonny Rollins played sax on Waiting On A Friend.  Final mixes were done at Island Recording in London May 28 - Jun 20, 1973.  Hide Your Love was recorded in separate sessions on May 23 & 26 at Olympic Studios in London.  Silver Train was recorded during the mixing at Island in London.<br />Interesting notes include:<BR>.....The UK version of the album had one verse censored and deleted from Star#$!@% (which appears as Star Star in text on the album) while the US version had the line \\"I bet you keep your pussy clean\\" deleted.  Both record distributors (US and UK) refused to allow the line \\"giving head to Steve McQueen\\" until the Stones got McQueen to signa release (he said he appreciated the publicity).  (The entire song with all the censored lyrics are on this release, or at least they are on my copy.)<BR>.....Short And Curlies was not released until 1974 on the album It's Only Rock `n' Roll.<BR>.....Tops and Waiting On A Friend were not released until 1981 on the album Tattoo You, after which Waiting On A Friend was also released as a single.<BR>.....there are still 12 tracks from these sessions that have not been released (although some have been bootlegged)  They are Criss Cross (Save Me), Separately, You Should Have Seen Her Ass, Four And In, Give Us A Break, First Thing, Miami, Man-Eating Woman, Brown Leaves, After Muddy & Charlie, Jamaica I, and Zabadoo.<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection, with some of the notes from Davis' \\"Old Gods Almost Dead.\\"  Both books are available from amazon.com.
B00003CY0V|2.0|I rented this so I could see Drea De Matteo, and sure she has only a couple scenes, only a few lines, and so on, but I loved her in it.  It's cute how they did the irony thing with her talking about parental fitness while she makes porn and drinks and can't even be there when her daughter needs a ride.  Also, she get whacked (preparing for when Adriana gets it? HA HA).<BR>See this for her, and Halle Berry's boobies, and forget the rest.
B000031WYP|5.0|this is one of the recordings that made me believe that hvk knew what he was doing. he brings out details in the music that i'd never heard in other recordings. it was a revelation. one reviewer put it well: this is a wagnerian treatment of an italian opera, the music telling the story even w/o the words. i was impressed. a first rate version of cav. highly recommended. good price, too, considering it includes the libretto.
6304712936|5.0|Peter Shaffer wrote the &quot;Amadeus&quot; screenplay based on his play, which is a quirky, fanciful vision of Mozart and Salieri, and how God gave Mozart the gift of musical genius despite his character flaws, but bypassed Salieri, who tried to strike a deal with the Almighty, vowing pious devotion, if He would only grant him brilliance and fame.<br />F. Murray Abraham is marvelous portraying Salieri's pride and envy, and having to suffer the indignity of mediocrity; the part garnered him a Best Actor Oscar and a Golden Globe, among other awards, and as Mozart, Tom Hulce is stupendous, with his high pitched raucous giggle, fluffy wigs, and energetic appeal.<br />Others in the cast of note are Elizabeth Berridge, excellent as Mozart's wife Constanza, and Roy Dotrice as his stern father Leopold.<br />The biggest star of the film however, is the music...the glorious sounds of Mozart's operas, and his magnificent Requiem. Many of my favorite scenes are depicted, from the ballet music from &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, to &quot;Don Giovanni a cenar teco&quot;, as well as portions of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, and much more.<br />Some of the great voices heard are Samuel Ramey (Figaro), Richard Stilwell (Count Almaviva / Don Giovanni), June Anderson (Queen of the Night), Brian Kay (Papageno) and Gillian Fisher (Papagena), though the parts on screen are played by actors, and not those singing.<br />Twyla Tharp's choreography is fresh and exhilarating, Miroslav Ondricek's cinematography is exquisite, and Milos Forman's direction imaginative and well paced.<br />As well as Best Actor, the Academy bestowed Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Sound, all well deserved.<br />Total running time is 160 minutes.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Critically, this film can be flailed (!) for its omissions, contradictions, etc.  For this, I award four stars.  However, the cinematography, acting, directing, etc. are all tremendous.  It is too strong for children, so don't let your non-teen children see it unless you want them to have nightmares of bloated-eyeball Jesus.  It is a gory torture movie full of blood, pain, and little else.  That said, I think it should be required viewing for everyone else on Earth.  Historically, religiously, and culturally, the film is a triumph, and seeing it make $300 million + at the box office amidst all the cruddy kiddy movies was extremely satisfying.  But don't listen to me--you've already probably decided whether or not to see it.  Here is what this movie will be remembered for after all the hype dies down.<br /><br />Passion is an anomaly within its admittedly odd circle of like-minded films.  Compare 10 Commandments, Ben-Hur, King of Kings, etc. to this film and you get the feeling that the Christians have finally caught up to the realistic standard in cinema since those films were released nearly 50 years ago.  It really is a step forward even from Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, which was released over 15 years ago.  (If you hate that film, by the way, you probably haven't seen it.  It's a beautiful expression of faith in its own right.)  Finally, Gibson takes the bible-history movies into this millenium.<br /><br />Passion is a film made by Christians for Christians.  I know many atheists who saw the film, however, and at least respect the principles of Jesus now.  If anyone says that this is not an achievement, then they know nothing about the difficulties of trying to preach to the uninitiated.  Those people on the street corners handing out flyers get spit on daily; they have guts, too.  Think they're nuts if you want, but admit their determination is uncommon.<br /><br />In the same way, it's necessary to appreciate the message of this film:  this is the man we have based our religion on, and this is what we know he went through.  In dealing only with the tribulation of Jesus, Gibson reduces belief to pain.  Would you suffer physical pain for the notions you hold true?  Few would.  This, my friends, is why we still see him as a model for the rest of us.  Jesus had inner strength uncommon in man.  Gibson is no savior, but he does remind us of something vital with this film.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has a lot of guts.  You have to respect a man who put his neck on the chopping block of public opinion in order to express his religious convictions.  Too bad he didn't have the gall to finish producing F 9/11, but I'll take one major career risk a year as sufficient progress.is the man we have based our religion on, and this is what we know he went through.

B00006879E|5.0|After hearing their third single, She Will Be Loved, on the radio, I knew that this CD by Maroon 5 was a &quot;must-have&quot; for me! Now that it's been in my car's cd player for the past month, I can't just choose one favorite song and don't want to listen to anything else. Songs I constantly hit the &quot;repeat&quot; button for: She Will Be Loved and Not Coming Home. Great addition to your music collection!!
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is a great cd.  Although the third film was not my favorite of the 3, it certainly had the best score.  I highly recomend this cd.  The percussion parts on songs like The Knight Bus are awesome.  The score is very different from the first two while still cleary flowing together.
B00000IN5G|5.0|I've long heard a lot of praise for Finland's Children of Bodom. Ultimately, after listening to the album repeatedly during about half a year of owning it, I have decided that this praise is well-deserved. Children of Bodom are an interesting addition to the wave of Scandinavian (or thereabouts) metal bands. The biggest comparison to another band that I can make would have to be to Sonata Arctica; like, if you replace Tony Kakko with a black metal vocalist, and intensify the guitars just a bit, you have Children of Bodom. Hell, both bands are from Finland, too! Must be something in the water...      I might add a note about the band's name: in 1960, four teenagers were camping in Finland, at Bodom Lake, just outside of Helsinki. That night, they were assaulted by some unseen attacker, and three of them were murdered brutally, and the other one went crazy (to this day, as far as I know). True story! This incident is well-known in Finland as one of their worst crimes, and is definitely worth checking into alone. Now we have a band named after those children of Bodom who were slaughtered...      Blending styles similar to both melodeath (especially Soilwork and Dark Tranquillity, a la keyboards) and black metal (screeching vocals that are particularly evil-sounding, as well as extremely intense musical delivery), Children have a very signature kind of sound that is like a blast of frosty air from over the mountains: at once fierce and yet beautifully refreshing.      One of the few metal bands that I enjoy which has only one lead guitarist, Children's metal is highly melodic but very intensely heavy. Alexi Laiho is immediately recognizable with his uniquely high-pitched vocals, but it are his contributions as lead guitarist that are most noteworthy. Although fellow guitarist Alexander Kuoppala does not shred up lead notes, the two are a tightly interweaving duo reminiscent more than often of Murray & Smith, Chris & Michael Amott, and Mustaine & Friedman. The Iron Maiden similarity is the most obvious - just listen to the first part of the bridge of &quot;Hatebreeder&quot; and just try to tell me that isn't reminiscent of something Murray & Smith wouldn't do. The two have great speed and use many chords with excellent finesse, but it is Laiho's leads which steal the show. He shreds with uncompromising speed and ease, yet maintains the great melodies present in each of the songs. He does not just save his leads for the bridges of songs, either - like on &quot;Hatebreeder,&quot; there are leads throughout the verses and choruses. An especially noteworthy performance is on the bridge/outro to &quot;Cowards Dead End&quot; - the way Laiho plays out his leads, it sounds like the orchestral arrangements of a classical piece!      Often, Laiho alternates leads and solos with keyboardist Janne Pimeys to create beautifully crafted interweaving notes. Many people find keyboard solos in metal songs to be overtly cheesy, but I think that if done right (like Children of Bodom does), it can be very effective. Pimeys is great in every aspect of his instrument; his background textures finely complement the melodic riffs, yet when he leads, the work can make a listener laugh with how beautifully it fits in (like his solos in &quot;Silent Night, Bodom Night&quot;). His almost blissful intro to &quot;Black Widow&quot; is simply beautiful. If it wasn?t obvious enough already, Children of Bodom is a very beautiful band while being excellent at metal.      Henkka T. Blacksmith is far from the average bassist; although a majority of his bass blends in with the heavy riffs, he can often be heard creating his own complex rhythms which add to the onslaught. Blacksmith does an awesome sort of &quot;lead&quot; in during the last chorus of the title track, too - just listen to that and tell me that's not cool! To once again bring up an Iron Maiden comparison, Blacksmith's interweaving bass lines are reminiscent of Steve Harris. (NOTE: I'm not saying that Children of Bodom compare to Iron Maiden in any form of greatness, I just mean how they SOUND can be awfully similar at times).      And finally, Jaska Raatikainen is a memorable drummer. Complex, fast, heavy on double-bass (but not to the point of overkill like too many death and black metal bands do), and hard-hitting, he can do it all. Every track is a perfect example of his talent, so it is really hard to find anything particularly outstanding (although he becomes even better on FOLLOW THE REAPER).      Now what to say about HATEBREEDER? Nine songs clocking in at just a little over half an hour is a little too short for my tastes, but Children of Bodom are good at making short, fast, hefty songs which always manage to kick some a$$. The lyrics largely deal with...er, death, I guess. It is often hard to distinguish what the songs mean, but &quot;Silent Night, Bodom Night&quot; is obviously a metal song's retelling of the story behind the band's name. While I'm talking about lyrics, I'll mention my biggest (and probably only) problem with the band: they never include ALL the lyrics to their songs. They include most in this case, but on HATE CREW DEATHROLL, for instance, they include the lyrics to 4 out of 9 of the songs. Alexi Laiho, who writes all the lyrics, insist that some of the songs are &quot;too personal&quot; to include the lyrics to. Okay, I'm not sure how &quot;I'm accessing in all the northern light/ You know I got no f***ing other souls, guilty now/ I've got no fine, no f***ing thoughts, so/ A combination, now you're f***ing dead&quot; is all that personal, but whatever. The lyrics are hardly one of Children of Bodom's strengths, so it hardly matters.      Some of my favorite tracks include &quot;Silent Night, Bodom Night&quot; (obviously; I've only mentioned it four times now), &quot;Hatebreeder,&quot; &quot;Black Widow&quot;...hell, they're all good. This is a fantastic album. If you like black metal, melodeath, or even just well-crafted metal, this willbe a treat. Go buy it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I know, I know.  Avril Lavigne. Twelve year old girls listen to her music, and her \\"attitude\\" is similar to her pre-pubescent fans.  But, hey, this cd is so awesome. Whether you like her or not, you've got to admit she's got a great talent for singing.  And it's that plus awesome guitar.  Buy it.
B00005JA2B|4.0|Yeah, I'm reviewing a Kansas album so go ahead and laugh.  But with all laughing aside, I think more people should realize that Kansas aren't the band they seem to be.  God only knows why, but Kansas are always lumped together with a bunch of other bands that sound nothing like them.  Have you noticed that too?  Kansas always seem to be lumped in with Foreigner, Journey, Styx, etc.  That's very inaccurate, and probably turns alot of people away;  People who would actually like the band.  I've said it before about other bands, but those people fortunate enough to have grown up and listened to rock in the 70s know what the deal with Kansas was.  They were good.....very good.  AND THEY SOUNDED NOTHING LIKE FOREIGNER OR JOURNEY!  It sounds more like a mix of Rush and Molly Hatchet(minus the southern twang of course).  Sure, they could have picked a better name for the band.  I mean, after all, Kansas is a pretty lame name for a band.  But if you have the slightest interest in what Kansas are really about, or you're a classic/progressive/hard rock fan, there's no reason you shouldn't get Leftoverture.

B00003CXCT|5.0|...these movies absolutey destroy (in comparison) the (NEW) Star Wars movies. I've been waiting for 6-7 years for these to be released on DVD, so quit whining. So they are not the ORIGINAL, but they are close...and for you people that have trouble moving on from this I suggest you get a life. You have WAY TOO MUCH free time to be criticle of this. Get the movies, and enjoy...go whine about the new Star Wars movies, they deserve criticism. At least the 1st 3 movies have good acting compared to todays films...think about it. Most movies these days suck, for good reason too...POOR ACTING...POOR WRITING...or the fact that EVERYTHING has been done to death. If you still have problems with that, go ride a bike outside or something...spend quality time with your kids. They are MOVIES...not life.

B00000I0XW|4.0|Not many people have a musical written around their voice, but that's what Andrew Lloyd Webber did for ex-wife Sarah Brightman, by creating the classic &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; musical. And in &quot;The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection,&quot; Brightman sings various songs from Webber's works -- some mesh with her voice, and some don't.<br />It starts off on a strong note with the gothic &quot;The Phantom Of The Opera,&quot; a duet with Michael Crawford. Following that is the ethereal &quot;Unexpected Song,&quot; the rich but forgettable &quot;Chanson D'Enfance,&quot; and the enchanting &quot;All I Ask Of You,&quot; a duet with Cliff Richards. Following a few dud songs are the warm &quot;Love Changes Everything,&quot; the Latin-tinged &quot;Amigos Para Siempre (Friends For Life)&quot; with Jose Carreras, and the entertaining duet with John Gielgud, &quot;Gus the Theatre Cat.&quot;<br />Brightman starts to falter with &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina,&quot; &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall,&quot; and &quot;Memory.&quot; Her voice sounds restricted and uneasy, and at times her crystalline vocals sound shrill. &quot;Maclivity: The Mystery Cat&quot; is perhaps the lowest point of &quot;Collection,&quot; with Brightman sounding completely weird. But the album rises again with the gently melancholy &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday,&quot; soaring &quot;Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,&quot; and finishing up with the majestic &quot;Music of the Night.&quot;<br />Certain voices are best suited for certain songs, and Brightman's vocals are clearly suited for songs from &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;Aspects of Love.&quot; Some of the songs sound astounding and heartfelt, but some of them just sound strange coming in her rich soprano.<br />Brightman's voice is given a good range -- she can sing in a little high girlish voice, soar like an operatic diva, or just sound sweet. At her best, Brightman can give you goosebumps. In many of the songs, she emotes subtlely, as if she really feels the heartbreak, joy and fear behind the songs. But when her voice is poorly used, as in the &quot;Evita&quot; songs, she just sounds confused.<br />The selection itself can't be faulted -- there's stuff from &quot;Cats,&quot; &quot;Phantom,&quot; &quot;Evita,&quot; and other Webber musicals. And Webber's writing is just beautiful, simple and heartfelt: &quot;In all your fantasies/You always knew/That man and mystery/ Were both in you...&quot;<br />Sarah Brightman is not in top form in the &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection,&quot; but in several songs she is simply astounding. Flawed but definitely worth checking out.tlely, as if she really feels the heartbreak, joy and fear behind the songs.

0743455967|5.0|This tiny book would be lost on a shelf of King's door-stop thick fiction, but I found it just the right length.  The first half is his autobiography.  While reading it I saw his 'bio' of one of the cable channels.  I must say that the sanitized TV version did not do justice to the book - hmmmm sounds like a chronic Stephen King problem.  I'll not spend any time about his story except to say that I liked (1) the way he did NOT glorify his drug and alcohol abuse and (2) the way he (at least in writing) praises his wife.  I don't read much of his fiction, but I respect him for those things. <br /> <br />The how-to section is good and interesting.  He offers very practical advice and down-to-earth opinions.  You might get more from other books on writing, but most are not written by someone of King's stature in the publishing world.  That alone makes it worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br />

1592400876|5.0|For a long time, I hid my sickness. I only talked about it to close friends, people who wouldn't judge me. I thought I was the only person who cringed each time I saw &quot;your&quot; when it should have been &quot;you're&quot; or wanted to rewrite entire Amazon.com reviews because of atrocious spelling and/or punctuation. Now I know that I'm not alone; in fact, I'm in good company. This book does the unthinkable. It takes both a humorous and an educational look at the often overlooked (and undertaught) world of punctuation. There is a lot of historical information included, but the humor is what kept me hooked. I actually found myself laughing out loud at parts of this book. That could be because I'm an English teacher, but I like to think it's because Lynne Truss is a funny lady and this is one funny book. The next time I'm about to pull my hair out while teaching apostrophes to eighth-graders, I'll pull out this book and have a good laugh. Lord knows I'll need it.
B00008EYA5|1.0|Collin Farell can't act for sh....<br />I saw this movie one a VCD...think god I didn't pay 8 bucks for a ticket for this crap in a box...<br />What a dumb film...Samual L. Jackson saved it....Movie sucked pretty much.....Horrible casting...Worst then Phone Booth...Acctually Phone was worse then this........they both suck pretty much...<br />I wish i could give it a -000000/5...<br />Worst movie I've seen last summer...<br />Later...
B00009TB5G|5.0|Usually, the second movie in a trilogy is the weakest.  It doesn't have the freshness of the first movie or the finality of the final movie.  The Two Towers, however, is the exception to the rule.  For lack of a better phrase, it rocks!!!  The extra material included in this extended version DVD really fleshes out the movie.  After you watch it you'll wonder why Peter Jackson left it out; it makes the movie complete.  The fight scenes at Helm's Deep are great, and you forget that a lot of what you're seeing is computer generated.  Several new characters are introduced, but you feel like you've known them all along.  The best part of the movie is the addition of a Boromir/Faramir scene.  Of course, I could be biased.  I love Boromir (Sean Bean).  This movie is a cinematic masterpiece.  It's great!!!
0385659806|5.0|There's a reason this book is high up on the bestseller list:  it's highly unusual and the intelligent reading public wants things such as this; things off the beaten path.  The same thing happend with &quot;Life of Pi&quot; and &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood.&quot;  Serious readers are tired of car-chase lit with its shallow characters and thin plots.  These books, especially &quot;Curious Incident&quot; are different not only in theme, but execution as well.  If you have to read one book this summer, make it this short, easy, fun, and extremely informative read.  Autism as seen from the inside of the mind. Highly recommended.
B00008PX8P|5.0|this DVD is the most incredible DVD you'll ever slide into your DVD player. I must admit I bought it as a new Zeppelin listener, sure I had heard their hits like stairway to heaven, dazed and confused, etc. and I actually put down the 20-something dollars for the dvds on a complete impulse buy, a whim if you will.  I had no IDEA what I was about to experience!!!  I have become an avid Zeppelin fan ever since.  everyone can enjoy this dvd, heck I've put it into the player at parties I've held and people forget their card games or beer bonging sessions and everyone congregates around the television.  If you have ears whether they like classic rock or heavy manson rock, you will love and enjoy this incredible set of dvds.  One time I actually misplaced the DVD set and was so adamate about it I almost went out and bought it again!! I would have!!  it's that good, but thankfully I found it in my freezer some drunk kid thought it was too hot cuz we played it so long at the party it had to cool off!!  haha well I've said my part, this dvd should be owned by everyone on the planet and that's putting it lightly.
B000286S8S|4.0|So close.....but so far away. I agree with some of the other reviews that Fair Warning should have had at least two more songs on this set(Mean Street and So This Is Love). The live songs should not have been on there at all. The strangest thing is that the strange instrumental &quot;Strung Out&quot; is included at the beginning of &quot;Not Enough.&quot; This is a good set and I like the way they mixed up the songs but the three new ones should have been mixed in as well. Besides the Fair Warning songs...the biggest omissions are Don't Tell Me, Humans Being, & Me Wise Magic. Those songs are some of their best. Bad move guys!! As for VH3? Well, maybe &quot;Without You&quot; should have been a hidden bonus track or something. No great loss though.
B0001ZX0OW|1.0|First off..someone please tell Clint Eastwood to back away from the camera slowly and never ever direct another film. As far as everyone who raves about this film..you have lost all cred. I supposed your enthralled by shiny objects too. The ending was ridiculous....my daughter is killed..lets go to a parade?????? The fact that this drivel was considered genius in two mediums is baffling...more proof that everything is watered down beyond hope...whoever says this is a classic- I have some old home movies..you wanna shell out money to see those too???
0394800184|1.0|Many of you, \\"Parents\\", have exposed this book unto your families. Same thing with my mother. She exposed this story to me. But you know what I see in this book of evil? Scary images and ideas. Look at the dog for instance. Does he look like a \\"nice\\" dog to you? He didn't to me. He scarred the buttons of my shirt. Everytime I look at his eyes I fill with fear. But the idea of being seperated from your parents of the worst fear factor. AND in addition. NEVER EVER EVER BUY THE VIDEO THAT GOES WITH THIS BOOK! It has bizarre music that will stick in your childs minds while the sleep and haunt them. I had many nightmares about \\"Are You My Mother\\" and your kids shouldn't. NEVER BUY THIS BOOK!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|The first time I ever saw Ashton Kutcher was the very first episode of &quot;That '70's Show&quot;---a show that I fell in love with right away. As it went on to become one of the best sitcoms in the past ten years, I at first saw star Topher Grace as becoming the superstar of the bunch. However, as the third season began, I began to realize that Ashton Kutcher was the valedictorian. As terminally clueless, and childishly impish, stoner Michael Kelso, the former straight-A college engineering student has created one of the most memorable sitcom characters of the modern television era. His impending superstardom seemed more &amp; more destined to be. By the beginning of the year 2000, I was wondering when his first movie would come out. By the end of the year 2000, my question had been answered, though not my prayers.<br />As Ashton's film career began with the incredibly unfunny DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?, I shook my head with disappointment at how the lowest-common-denominator mindset of Hollywood was going to drag him down along the forgotten road of Typecast Alley. I missed the few other comedies he did afterwards (TEXAS RANGERS--2001, JUST MARRIED, MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER--both 2003), but after viewing my DVD rental of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT (2004) last week, I was disappointed no more.<br />THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT shows the beginnings of Kutcher's hopefully-maturing career-turn as a real all-around actor. This isn't an Oscar-caliber performance, but he brings a real heart &amp; soul to his portrayal of a young man whose future seems inexorably bound to his past---a past to which he discovers he can return at any time in order to affect his present. Evan tries to fix what went wrong in his life; however, in doing so he creates unintended consequences for himself and his beloved Kayleigh (a radiant Amy Smart, showing real depth of character here). <br />This DVD shows both the original 113-minute Theatrical Version and the full 2-hour Director's Cut. I saw only the latter version, which is said to be the superior cut. I have not yet seen the original, so I am unable to compare the two versions. I will just say for now that the Director's Cut had a similar effect on me as the incredible Adrian Lyne-directed 1991 psycho-horror flick JACOB'S LADDER (1991): both films begin as strangely perplexing, but develop a strangely hypnotic and engrossing quality as well. As much as I wondered what the *beep* was going on, I just couldn't take my eyes off the bizarre action unwinding onscreen. And then *THE ENDING*---&gt; Unexpectedly blindsiding, it pulls the previously indecipherable clues all together, and makes total sense out of senselessness, order out of chaos. Funny that the central theme of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT *is* Chaos Theory! <br />Although it displays some of the more unpleasant qualities of a conventional horror flick (foul-mouthed youngsters doing things they have no business in doing, cute dogs existing purely for the purpose of being sadistically put to death), there is no doubt that Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber---the co-writers and directors who had previously teamed up to write the 2002 chiller sequel FINAL DESTINATION 2---have crafted a truly original story that contains a deceptive amount of substance behind the blurry, slick style. Some people---especially kids, it seems---did not particularly like the Director's Cut ending. I say that this is the only true ending this story could have had. (It also serves my strongly-felt theory that movies like this are most decidedly not meant for kiddies.) It makes me all the more curious as to what alternative kind of ending was edited into the Theatrical Version in order to 'please' the audience (whatever it was, it sure didn't seem to please many). Well, it looks like I'll just have to purchase this loaded-with-extras DVD to find out. That's just fine with me, as the Director's Cut alone is worth the money! If you're like me and passed on seeing THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT during its theater run, take another look at it on DVD. It may just surprise you, too!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; AGES 16 &amp; UP
B00003CXSP|5.0|This is a wonderfully twisted film. It is the second sequel to Michael Mann's excellent film &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986), Jonathan Demme's &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991) being #2, and Ridley Scott's &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001) being #3. Also see Brett Ratner's &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), the remake of &quot;Manhunter&quot;.  <br /> You can read about the plot and everything under the amazon.com review so I won't bother. in the end this is a GREAT film with excellent acting, directing and script. As all the &quot;Manhunter&quot; films are concerned this is the most underrated and mabye the best in my book. All four of these films are classics and I recomend them to any hard core movie fan. They are murder mystery cinema at its best! <br />  <br /> &quot;Hannibal&quot; by Ridley Scott (2001) <br /> Anthony Hopkins, Julieanne Moore <br /> *****/***** <br />  <br /> One final note Moore and Foster give equally memorable performences as Agent Starling.
0385659806|5.0|Great book!  I couldn't put it down.  The subtle ways Haddon reveals the characters and the plot are so delicate and intricate that you never notice his devices.  I laughed out loud in many areas and was truly moved by the authenticity of the characters.  Viewing the world though the eyes of autism was eye opening.  Steve Martin tried to do something similarly ambitious in The Pleasure of My Company but couldn't quite pull it off .  STEVE!  If you're out there, read this book.
0553213105|5.0|As I read Pride and Prejudice, one thing struck me--that I reacted to the twists in the plot rather strongly.  I laughed aloud at the wit; I smiled at the *ahem* 'cute' romance; I shouted at the characters when they missed obvious signals and acted like idiots...but such as it is, lets just say that I was truly affected by this book.  Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel.  I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author.
B000002UA0|5.0|piper at the gates of dwan was one of the greatest debut albums produced by any band which was equalled only by the debut albums of led zeppelin and black sabbath.songs likw astronomy domine,interstellar overdrive,matilda mother are great songs and among my favourite syd barret era songs.dont overlook this masterpiece if you like classic rock as this was the album which started the golden floydian era.highly recommended.
B00024BHTC|5.0|this album is nothing short of amazing. ONCE surpasses most other bands out there, not cutting down those bands , but i won't compromise my opinion even though some of the forementioned &quot;other bands&quot; are favorites of mine , but nightwish is my absolute favorite and will continue to be so and i will support anything and everything they do. toumas is a musical genious and tarja's voice is the true definition of beauty . jukka , emppu , and marco combined with tarja and toumas make up the most amazing band of our time , NIGHTWISH. <BR>this album is sure to please any true fan of symphonic metal, and i stress the words &quot;true fan&quot;<br />p.s. ONCE is never enough.

B000000HSU|3.0|For this CD, you need to talk about not just the music but also how it has been presented.  First, the music part.  \\"Rock for Light\\" was the Bad Brain's first full-length vinyl release, coming a couple of years after their attention-getting (on the underground scene) release for New York's cassette-only ROIR label. A lot of the tracks from the ROIR release are repeated here.  In case you don't know--and maybe you don't, which is why you read these reviews--the music here is punk rock.  The Bad Brains' fast, precisely played interpretation of it was one of the sounds that helped create the template for hardcore punk, for better and worse.  Vocalist H.R. does everything from croon to screech to yowl as he belts out frequently Rastafarian-themed lyrics about freedom, social ills, and the like.  Three reggae tracks are mixed in--not the greatest reggae you'll ever hear, but a nice change of pace and certainly played from the heart.  The riffs are hard and the musicians know what they're doing; this is great music to set your heart racing and get your arms and legs pumping.    The presentation: As two earlier reviewers (Tokyogarman and ebblank) suggested in their comments, all of the hardcore songs have been sped up a full half-step on the CD reissue from the original vinyl release of \\"Rock for Light.\\"  I used to play these songs on guitar all the time and have them pretty much committed to memory, and I had to play everything higher when I played along to the CD.  If you've got the LP, you can play it side by side with the CD--you'll hear the change right away.  Oddly, the reggae songs still play at the same speed, though a lot of the toasting (the bits thrown in at the end of the reggae songs where somebody, presumably an overdubbed H.R., throws in the occasional, \\"Rasta say 'revolution' bingity bingity bong,\\" and so forth) is now buried in the mix for the CD.    Hard to say whey they did this.  Speeding up a recording is frequently a producer's or record company's trick to make a band seem more energetic--surely, that's the last thing anyone had to worry about with the Bad Brains?     The ROIR cassette was indeed a classic, but the sound was terribly muffled (I haven't heard the CD reissue so I don't know if they \\"fixed\\" that), like they had recorded it in a large cardboard box.  That made the cleaner-sounding \\"Rock for Light\\" a most welcome release in 1983 (at least if you weren't hung up on the idea that a muddy recording was somehow more authentic and \\"real\\"). But the LP still suffered from some odd choices about the sound balance between the instruments, and that problem has not been fixed with the CD. The biggest complaints about the vinyl mix are (1) you can hardly hear or feel the bass, and (2) the guitar solo overdubs seem to float on top of the music. Given that bassist Darryl Jennifer had a hand in so-called remix for the CD, I was surprised to discover that the bass was still pretty inaudible.  Moreover, the guitar sounds REALLY strange now--all treble, no midrange or low end sounds. The only improvement was that the vocals seem to be clearer and have greater presence.  After purchasing this, I was tempted to just burn my vinyl to CD and tack on the three extra tracks that appear on the CD version that weren't on the LP.    (In the end, I just ripped the hardcore tracks to my computer, slowed the speed to about 93% to shift the pitch down, recorded the vinyl versions of the reggae tunes, and burned myself a \\"proper\\" version of the CD.)    All told, the music itself rates a 4.5; this CD gets a 3 mainly for the disappointments.  If you can't find (or play) the vinyl, you won't suffer if you buy the CD, but you should be aware of its quirks.
B000024D4R|5.0|Not sure why so many people say not to buy this album first. I'm sure most people who listen to classic rock have heard songs from Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and the Wall on the radio, so we pretty much know what we're getting before we buy those records. <br />  <br /> But Animals is the real prize of the four because it sounds so fresh and was never overplayed. Structured in the same format as WYWH, it is a five song cycle bookended by the first and last song which are similar: Pigs on the Wing. In between we have the epic Dogs, whose melody will haunt your waking awareness. Then we have Pigs (Three Different Ones) and Sheep. All songs are epic with the fat Pink Floyd sound - clear wailing guitars and trippy keyboards. And we have typically brilliant Waters lyrics such as: &quot;then it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around, so have a good drown, as you go down, all alone - dragged down by the stone.&quot; <br />  <br /> Be sure to listen for the demented version of PSALM 23 (not the Lord's Prayer, moron !) in Sheep. After a few listens, Animals will be your favorite Pink Floyd album (so why not buy it FIRST!)
B00003CXDG|1.0|Ethan Hunt, with all at his disposal, perhaps is bested at being the one man who can put an end to this, by none other than would be action director John Woo. I have NEVER been a Woo fan. His previous &quot;action&quot; films bored me to tears. Really, I don't understand people. Um, ANYONE can direct a bunch of people to mock shoot at each other, while fireballs are being blown up, and pigeons flying, all to a ridiculous &quot;storyline&quot;. It's not that difficult. I don't buy that Hong Kong bs. There are good action films that have come out of Hong Kong that actually posses a story. He just happened to do someone in Hollywood a favor. He's cancerously overrated, much like this film, which is a travesty to action films period. Why bother calling it Mission Impossible 2? It has NOTHING to do with the MI series. I liked the first film because, guess what? It actually had something to do with ESPIONAGE, which in case anyone forgot, is supposed to be what the DAMN FILM IS ABOUT!!!Why didn't anyone tell that to Woo? Oh yeah right. To busy admiring himself in the mirror.
B00005JMSE|5.0|Guillermo del Toro's HELLBOY is one of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. Ranking up there with BATMAN RETURNS and SPIDER-MAN, this is a fantastic example of everything a movie of this genre should have: Great action, spectacle without overkill, story before style and a leading man who carries the whole movie on his broad shoulders. Ron Pearlman is unquestionably the perfect guy for the role, eschewing the usual moody, anti-heroes of previous CB movies that tried (And failed) at setting the bar for excellence, this is a film that rides on no ones coattails, instead shows off its originality well. The music is brooding and stylish, the supporting cast is excellent and the villains are great fun. So what else is there to say?  If you haven?t seen it, go see it now, and if you have already, then see it again. Now.
078322804X|5.0|Here is one of the few movies in my lifetime that qualifies as a \\"feel good\\" flick, one where I left so fulfilled I actually missed the characters, story and fun when the movie is over, wanting it all back again. Fortunately, through the miracle of tape and DVD, you and I can both do that!<br />This production was the linchpin event for the Saturday Night Live characters that wore black suits and sunglasses before the equally fashion-challenged \\"Men In Black\\" showed up. Along with \\"Animal House\\", this flick reminds me what a great comedy career John Belushi would have had in cinema had he lived more safely (as long as he stayed away from bombs like \\"1941\\").<br />Back to the film...this is loaded with great music, music from many 20th Century ages, music that makes you want to hum, tap your toe, dance, delight, smile, kiss your girlfriend and say hello to God. The plot -- something about getting money for an orphanage -- is superfluous but the movie has memorable scenes and characterizations equal to the equally uninhibited \\"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad World\\" from 1963.<br />A hyperactive musical street scene coming out of a music store -- led by the late Ray Charles doing a great blues tune -- is a typical venue in this film. Another time, Aretha Franklin takes a break from her waitress job to sing threateningly to Jake and Elmore. Still another time, Cab Calloway entertains kids so the brothers can get their cash to Chicago. In another scene, the Blues Brothers band does it up good in a honky tonk but drinks too much beer and ends up in a police-car-RV chase with some good old boys known as...the Good Old Boys!<br />This movie destroyed about 200 cars in and around Chicago and has one of the funniest car crash scenes and accompanying lines in American film history. The line is: \\"We're in a truck!\\" Watch the movie to get the joy from it. You'll laugh out loud and enjoy it almost as much as those Nazis driving off the end of the incomplete freeway overpass in Chicago!<br />If you want to experience mayhem disguised as two hours of uninhibited escapism filled with great fun, a thousand car chases and car crashes, lowlifes, ex-convicts and rednecks, and some of the best choreographed music sequences ever, buy, rent or borrow this DVD today and get set to ENJOY YOURSELF!If you want to experience mayhem disguised as two hours of uninhibited escapism filled with great fun, a thousand car chases and car crashes, lowlifes, ex-convicts and rednecks, and some of the best choreographed music sequences ever, buy, rent or borrow this DVD today and get set to ENJOY YOURSELF!
B000068FY0|5.0|I decided to get a Supertramp album as I've tried all the other bands who have dabbled in Prog Rock however had been reluctant as they were also said to be very Popy (you know what I mean... I hope) Anyway, upon listening to it I agreed with its Prog Pop naming however thoroughly enjoyed it. Its best listened to reading the lyrics (from the booklet), I don't really know why, but I recommend it.  <br /> Musically, it is very interesting, singer Richard Davies sounding, at times, like Peter Gabriel (slightly), and the heavy rocking riff (reminds me of a Uriah Heep song) on Bloody Well Right (great funny sounding song). The opener School reminds me of Pink Floyd and the much talked about on this page Hide In Your Shell is in my opinion slightly overated. It is a enjoyable song, however isn't the best on this album and certainly not Supertramps best. Asylem is an enjoyable song, as is the pop song Dreamer. The title song itself isn't stunning but is a good album ender. <br /> It's as simple as this, get this album if you like the sound of the above. From thier I can only suggest that you put the rest of their albums on your to get list, but put them near the bottom. They all have their own moments and songs of greatness but none of them are quite as good as this.  <br /> None the less, sit back and listen to this musical masterpiece that is... oh what was it? Oh yeah... Crime of the Century. <br /> I hope you find this review helpful. <br /> Toodle Pipskie (is that how you spell it?)
B00007L4MJ|4.0|Set in a faltering Utopia, the governor's son, Freder, is compelled to seek out the underpinnings of his existence.  He descends into an abysmal underworld of man-eating machinery that is nearly indistinguishable from his fevered hallucinations.<br /><br />Despite the film's hyper-drama and viciously precise arm movement, it is a riveting study that compellingly mirrors the French Revolution and yet eerily foretells the rise of Fascism. It invokes distinctly Germanic art styles as we see Freder become a black-uniformed living transistor, fully 20 years before transistors were invented.<br /><br />No movement, no lighting change is extemporaneous; in legendary Teutonic vision, every frame is set exactly as it must be.<br /><br />As an example of the film's relentless angst, the governor, Joh Fredersen, beholds his son breathtakingly idolizing a Joan of Arc character, Maria, to the revolutionary strains of La Marseillaise.  Maria's gaze is mesmerizing.<br /><br />To regain his son and control a worker's revolt, the governor beseeches an old nemesis to turn the first robot into a Maria automaton, but a Lorelei-type emissary.  Joh's desperation is Freder's undoing and, later, his own.  As the great city begins to hemorrhage, a fight for the future of the republic ensues.<br /><br />It will be impossible not to see Metropolis' incomparable flavor on dozens of other movies, not the least- George Lucas' entire Star Wars saga.<br /><br />Despite issues inherent to early movies and having lost a large portion of its substance to amateur Hollywood meddling, Metropolis is the watershed cinematic experience that every dedicated film-maker must acknowledge.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; is a true masterpiece of rock music. The album is truly thought provoking, unwinding a tale over two amazing CDs. <br />  <br /> About a week ago I was in a bit of a drout for something to listen to. As I searched threw my CD collection for an album with some good guitar on it - without being Hendrix - I found &quot;The Wall&quot;. I've always been a bit of a Pink Floyd fan, mainly because these guys could really make good rock. Anyone will tell you that this album is a classic, and I really love it, I can jam to this right here anytime. <br />  <br /> The album itself is about the mind of a troubled rockstar, who deals with the death of his father, controlling mother, opressive school teachers, broken marriage, his music, his fans and his bout with drugs, as the numerous problems and demons that haunt him. <br />  <br /> I still get excited when I come to listen to this, and everytime I never want it to end. Every song on this album is classic - there's not one I don't like. My favourite songs would have to be &quot;Another Brick In The Wall&quot; Parts 1 + 2. But every song on this album makes up the story, but the ones that have the deepest meanings are &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot;. <br />  <br /> Just because every song on the album contributes to the story, that doesn't mean that if you listen to any song it won't make sense. I regualy just pop in &quot;The Wall&quot; and listen to &quot;Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2&quot;. <br />  <br /> So from me &quot;The Wall&quot; gets five stars, and rightly so, as it is one of the best written, well played and complex rock albums ever. You don't even have to be heavy into rock - I'm not - to enjoy this masterpiece. It's worth having, not just for the history, not just for the outstanding guitar work, but for the absolute listening experience it is. This is recommended. 5 stars.
B000244EMO|5.0|when I first saw the first Predator film,I was happy to see the strong male role running for his life. Yet I do think why this editions for the Alien and Predator films are coming out so close to each other is for the summers next cross over. Alien vs Predator. But to the film, the first predator was by far the best. Sending in comandos into a rain forest and each one being killed off is truly a scary sight and yet the movie is full of action. Predator is by far one of my favorit films and I will go by this film when it comes out three days before the opeaning of AVP.
6305558167|3.0|Of all the horrid films based on Arthurian legends (it seems there's a curse preventing a good Arthurian film!), this is the &quot;best&quot; there is.  The screenplay is weak and the acting bearable at best but at least it sticks (roughly) to the legends (which is more than I can say for every other &quot;Arthurian&quot; film in existence).  For that reason, I recommend &quot;Excalibur&quot; over any other Arthurian film.

B000001Y9I|5.0|Ever since I got the album Machine Head whenever I have a group of CD's with me at school it's been there as it is one of my favorite albums. When my dad told me we were gonna see Deep Purple it was mind blowing, and when he said it was at massey hall )probly the greatest place to see a concert in Ontario.) I was extatic. Then he told me Blackmore isn't with the group anymore... My response was dissapointment. He told me a friend of his and seen then with the 'new guy' (as i knew him at the time) and he's great. I still wanted to see em but i didn't think the 'new guy' would be any good. <br />So my dad borrowed Purpendicular. and from the Intro of Ted the Mechanic I was amazed. I expected dissapointment and got pure musical Gold. From beggining to end the album is great some songs start out slow then bam enter will guitar filled riff's adding suspense to the tracks. and I must I think Steve Morse has mastered the art of 'Pinch-Harmonics'.This album is a deffinite must have the lack of Blackmore (i'll try to stop rhyming thing's with blackmore I sware) isn't bad it's different, they have differing styles.<br />oh and Purpendicular is also now almost always with me when i have cd's.
B000286S8S|4.0|I'm curious if anyone else's copy has the end of Disc 1, Track 6 &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; cutting off abruptly. It sounds like a mastering error, but I don't know if it's just my disc or all of them. Can anyone comfirm?
B000002L1L|3.0|First id like to say the name and cover of the album I believe symbolizes the on going roughness between Gillian and Blackmore<br />It's not a great album but when I hear things like 'Final hours' for the band and 'crap' it pisses me off Deep Purple is great and still is great even with Steve Morse on guitar infact in some ways he's better.<br />this album has it's moments. but it pails in comparision the next album released 2 years later Purpendicular,
B000006OS2|1.0|DON'T THROW OUT THE VHS!!  I foolishly didn't look in this section and see the previous reviews of the DVD before I bought it.  Bad move.  This DVD is the worst quality DVD transfer I have seen.  I compared the VHS and the DVD at the same time: The DVD was out of focus, color over-modulated and the picture slightly enlarged, so that, not only do you lose the Cinemascope aspect, but you also lose 5-10% of the vertical picture.  You would get a better DVD if you copied the VHS using a DVD recorder and doing it yourself.  I myself have tossed the DVD, kept the box and I'll make a copy.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I resisted Daredevil, because, frankly, there is such a glut of ?super hero? movies.  Not they are bad, but there are Xmen, Hulk, Spiderman?seems there is always another one, but nothing really that stands outs.  But I must say this movie surprised me.  With engaging performances by Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner in the leads, nice support from bad guys Michael Clark Duncan and Colin Farrell and as the nose-for-news reporter Joe Pantoliano, plus super effects, it?s a fun movie.  There is a driving soundtrack that really sets the mood for the movie,<br /><br />music that will cause you to go out and buy the soundtrack.<br /><br />It?s a tight rope act to bringing a comic book story to the screen, too often a movie will take itself too serious, or it comes across as too cartoonish.  Davedevil manages that balance.  You have enough seriousness to keep you hooked, but it has that ?stretch the boundaries? feel to retain the comic book flavor.<br /><br />The store is the typical line.  The young idealistic kid witnesses his father playing muscle for the local hood.  Shock by the ?fall? of his hero, he runs away and ends up losing his sight to a chemical spill.  The kid fights back and takes the<br /><br />advantages his other senses now give him and won?t give into the tragedy.  The death of his father, later sending him down the road as the avenger for the downtrodden, the defender of justice.  Garner plays his love interest, but she is a pawn sacrificed by her fathers misdeed.  The romance between Affleck and Garner is solid, the chemistry very believable.  Great fight scenes.  All the mix to make this just a very enjoyable movie in this genre.
6305364648|5.0|This movie has a lot of action and a good storyline behind it, coupled with a very funny interaction between Tom Arnold, Arnold and Bill Paxton.  It's a perfect mix of Tom Clancy national security thriller, action, and comedy. <br /> <br />I rate this one as one of the better films that Arnold has done, coupled with Predator, for its immersive value. <br /> <br />Get it
B00005JKJA|5.0|A few reviews have called this &quot;unexplainable.&quot; Nonsense. It's perfectly explainable, you just have to THINK ABOUT IT. This isn't a julia roberts movie - lynch doesn't explain every step of the plot as it happens, but rather he lets the viewer draw his or her own conclusions. It's a bit like visual poetry in that respect. Like i said in the title you really need to watch it twice to get the twist (and there is one, he hasn't just jumbled together random scenes as some reviews seem to suggest). If you've already seen it and are a little confused watch the opening 5 minutes again VERY CLOSELY, remembering that what's on screen throughout the movie isn't necessarily reality. If you get it watch Lost Highway, which for me is even better.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|This is a project that will only be appreciated by people who are not searching for &quot;radio-friendly&quot; music. Many folks liked her first album the best. I personally like Mama's Gun the best. This new CD sounds like an underground mix-tape and is quite clever. It is a very enjoyable listen. I like that she is willing try different concepts and expand her horizons. I wish the album were longer. <br />  <br /> I'm going to make a bold statement: <br />  <br /> This album will probably be enjoyed by people who are sophisticated music listeners.
B00001QEE7|3.0|save your $ on ebay auctions and wait for the platinum series release. this version's sound is excellent (dolby 5.1), but the bland/dull colors is a big disappointment. poor visibility,  below average clarity and very dark throughout the entire movie. i've seen better second generation VHS recordings. this being a classic Disney release, it deserves a new high definition transfer like Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King (outstanding DVD's).
B000089CJI|5.0|I first discovered The Postal Service at a 2004 Seattle-area music festival. All the bands preceding them were standard indie-rock fare, and the audience was pretty riled up before they went on.          When the music started, the change in the audience was remarkable. Everyone settled down and started swaying. By the third song the audience was positively hypnotized.          The Postal Service's music is suprising: its not what you'd expect from rock or pop or electronica. It mixes old with new sounds, complicated rhythms with simple, catchy melodies. The vocals are soft and personal, and the male/female harmonizing works well. There is a bit of reminiscence to it as well- I could swear one of the songs samples old nintendo game sounds.         Since I bought this CD I've listened to it many many times. Its soothing without being boring- great music to chill out to.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I know...a lot of people don't &quot;get&quot; it.  This is a story about humanity's desire to tweek nature to transcend the &quot;common&quot; human condition.  The hubris of science trying to break free of nature by manipulating nature...big business and the military industrial complex attempting to enlist this Icarus-like program for their own nefarious and very inhuman-human purposes...the HULK...transcending and returning to the very place his creation was an attempt to escape...those few Indians in South America facing genocide at the hands of modern civilization (so called)...snake bites it's own tail tale...
0920668372|5.0|I adore this book! My mom read it to me all the time when I was little. This is a wholesome book that sends a message of love, not death to a child. I'm sure there are a handful of children who focus on the ending, but not many. And the adults who focus on the ending are obviously unable to handle the concept of death. This book doesn't send a message of incest or inappropriate interaction between a mother and child. It tells the story of a loving relationship between a mother and son that lasts beyond the realm of childhood. In fact, when I have children of my own, I will buy my own copy (perhaps sooner) and read it to them.

B00020X88O|5.0|Let's all be honest with ourselves.  This film is about Elizabeth Berkley and how gorgeous she was in the nude.
B000286S8S|3.0|Not to disagree with my fellow reviewer but here would be a nice list also As follows: <br />  <br /> CD 1:  <br /> Runnin' with the Devil  <br /> Eruption  <br /> You Really Got Me  <br /> Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love  <br /> Jamie's Cryin'  <br /> Feel Your Love Tonight  <br /> Dance The Night Away  <br /> And the Cradle will Rock  <br /> Everybody Wants Some!  <br /> Mean Streets <br /> Unchained <br /> So This is love?  <br /> Where Have All the Good Times Gone  <br /> Cathedral  <br /> Secrets  <br /> Intruder  <br /> (Oh) Pretty Woman  <br /> Dancing in the Streets  <br /> Little Guitars (Intro)  <br /> Little Guitars  <br /> 1984  <br /> Jump  <br /> Panama  <br /> Hot for Teacher  <br /> I'll Wait  <br />  <br /> CD 2:  <br /> Why Can't This Be Love?  <br /> Dreams  <br /> Best of Both Worlds  <br /> Love Walks In  <br /> When It's Love <br /> Black and Blue  <br /> Finish What Ya Started  <br /> Poundcake  <br /> Runaround  <br /> Right Now  <br /> 316  <br /> Top of the World <br /> The Seventh Seal <br /> Amsterdam  <br /> Can't Stop Loving You  <br /> Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do  <br /> Not Enough  <br /> Deja Vu  <br /> Me Wise Magic <br /> and the other two songs Roth did <br /> on the 1ST greatest hits. <br />  <br /> So overall I would suggest possibly buying Van Halens first disc <br /> up to the Gary Cherone III album. I think you will enjoy alot more of the songs not listed and certainly the ones that are. <br /> Or.....wait another year or two for the &quot;deluxe box set&quot; I am sure they will put out.  <br />  <br />
B000286S8S|3.0|It's a great pickup for any Van Halen fan, love the switching back and forth between both Sam and Dave. But it would've been cool if they put Eddie's signature intro to songs like Cathedral, 316, etc...And got rid of the Live songs that most VH fans have heard already and added VH gems like Mean Streets, Little Guitars, Don't Tell me what Love Can Do, Human's Being, and maybe either Summer Nights or Ice Cream Man would've been great. Just my opinion but the Best of Both Worlds is great but incomplete for most Van Halen fans old and new. Could've been better but atleast Van Halen is back from hiatus.
B000063147|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is one of the best Harcore/punk/Screamo bands Ever! M. Shadows has an awsome voice and scream. There are awsome Guitar solos and Drums. This is the perfect harcore album for anyone. Better than Waking The Fallen. Avenged Sevenfolds older music is what sets them apart from the others. Dont fall for other cheap immatators, stick with the kings of Hardcore! A7X
B0000630BT|5.0|This cd was my first Judas Priest cd. I have to say it is the best Heavy Metal album I have ever heard. The drums are great, the guitars are great and vocals are awesome. If you have wondering which Judas Priest album you should get, GET PAINKILLER!!!<BR>P.S. great art on cover.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|In The Butterfly Effect, Ashton Kutcher plays a young man who discovers he can re-live traumatic experiences from his childhood, causing dramatic changes in the world and the people around him. <br />In better DVD releases, there are two things worth reviewing: the movie, and the DVD. <br />The movie is far better than most time-travel movies, and light years ahead of most Ashton Kutcher movies.  The movie is akin to Final Destination 2, which both writer-directors Eric Bress and J. Mackeye Gruber wrote and admit was a warmup for this film.  The movie features a psychology and chaos theory based method of time-travel, the idea that one event is part of a chain that alters everything.  The movie also features more controversial subject matter than anything I've ever seen.  One thing that probably hurt this movie were the expectations of Ashton fans, their expectation that they were not seeing a movie that deals with pedophilia, prostitution, animal murder, and shows Ashton beating a man to death with a baseball bat.  The subject matter works perfectly, and does not feel like it is there to shock you. <br />The DVD is excellent.  Even if you saw the film in theatres, you must see it on DVD because, honestly, you never really saw the film.  The DVD has the original ending, which is one of those shocking-yet-perfect-ties-everything-together endings that treats the viewer like a real person, not a movie-going sap.  The ending is the best thing in this movie, and I feel sorry for theatre goers who paid $9.50 and were still cheated of it.  It also features excellent Infinifilm features, including the theatrical ending, two additional endings, tons of deleted scenes and shorts, as well as interviews with some PhDs to better flesh out the brains of the film.  Definetly worth watching. <br />Movie - 8.5 out of 10    DVD - 10 out of 10
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This film is a wonderful story taken from the novel's by Patrick O'Brian. One can think of other well-made classic maritime films such as Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando, and my other favourite, Horatio Hornblower, starring Gregory Peck. These films will always be classics, as they have withstood the test of time, as Master and Commander will most certainly do in the future.<br /><br /> This high praise comes from the obvious, as this film is almost flawless in many respects, artistically, technically and its historical realism. However this unqualified praise really comes from the fact that my expectations before finally viewing the film were actually quite low. In fact, up until a few months ago, I had totally overlooked that Peter Weir was the film's director, and this man has proven himself to be one of the current greats in Hollywood. His past triumphs, such as Witness, staring Harrison Ford, in my opinion, was one of the top ten films made in the eighties. Considering my expectations were nothing to speak of, Master and Commander turned out to be a great surprise.<br /><br /> For the most part this film is a story about leadership, courage, tenacity, friendship, honour and loyalty. And this is all done in the film without having to resort to unnecessary sentimentalism or platitudes. Captain Jack Aubrey is the manifestation or epitome of all these virtues and more. What an inspiring character. Russell Crowe delivered a believable performance as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot;. Crowe has a tremendous amount of presence in front of the camera, which is the exact skill or gift necessary to play this particular character. If anything, most if not all the performances in this film were first rate.<br /><br /> The soundtrack, too, was appropriate for the film. As a classical music admirer and listener, for once I've been prompted to purchase the recording (which doesn't happen often) as well as the DVD to add to the library. Master and Commander is an &quot;all-rounder&quot; and will be a pleasure to watch many times over. A solid five stars.a pleasure to watch many times over. A solid five stars.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Yes, I admit it! I was sucked in by the hype! I was excited by the concept! I went to see the movie! I came away thoroughly disappointed... <br />If ever there was a case of 'over-egging the pudding' this is it. The concept of the titular character taking on three of Universal's classic monsters is great! So what do they do? Turn Dracula into a mad scientist, make the wolfman entirely CGI and don't even ask about Frankenstein's creature, his glowing cranium and melodic tenor voice. Throw in Mr Hyde (and Dr Jekyll) who aren't even Universal, Dracula's three Brides (who surprisingly are the best thing in the movie) and Dracula's 'children' (think flying Gremlins) and you begin to see that what we have here is enough plot (and I use the word loosely) to fill a trilogy. Steven Sommers seems to have got carried away with the success of The Mummy movies and lost the plot completely! <br />The 'human' characters are bland and two dimensional with Jackman's Van Helsing briefly showing promise before being thrown into yet another battle against an evil animated character. That the final battle is between two (rather poorly rendered) CGI characters says it all. <br />When the best you can say for a film is that the Production Design is good you know you're in trouble. The opening sequence is very promising as it harks back to the good old days. Even then the highlight of the film - a human character looks in a mirror to see her's is the only reflection out of a room full of people - was stolen whole-sale from Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers (AKA Dance of the Vampires). <br />There seems to be a plot twist somewhere, involving Van Helsing and his past relationship with Dracula. When it comes it is so under-whelming as to be embarrassing. It was obviously put in for the (doubtful considering this one' box office performance) sequel. Even if there is a sequel, considering how many major monsters were used up on this one, who can Van Helsing fight against? The Creature from the Black Lagoon? The Invisible Man? King Kong? Who Knows? Who Cares? <br />
B00008RH3L|5.0|Miller's Crossing is the most skillful and affectionate film ever based on the novels of Dashiell Hammett. The plot is roughly a cross between Hammett novels The Glass Key and Red Harvest, though it's in adapting the latter that the Coen's really hit their peak. Red Harvest was also the inspiration behind such fine films as Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and Walter Miller's Last Man Standing, but it's never been done better than here. (One wonders when the novel will be adapted under its own name.) This is perhaps the most violent story ever filmed and yet also the most ingenious: A town is run by two rival gangs and one man, in this case Gabriel Byrne, cleverly makes them destroy one another. The performances are inspired, especially the brilliant John Turturro as a very loose cannon. The scene where Byrne is led to his own death under a canopy of trees is one of the greatest moments ever filmed and is very nicely foreshadowed under the credits. If you like gangster movies and you've already seen the first two Godfather flicks, this is unquestionably the one to see. <br />
B00000427L|4.0|Having studied and played this concerto (the 3rd), I know that someone as great as Ashkenazy should be able to hit more of the notes in the first movement, especially with modern recording techniques which I know were available in the 1970s. It's still good. I actually think he plays the first mvt. cadenza kind of slow and ploddingly, then all of a sudden it speeds up. I'm not sure I like the interpretation, but it occurs to me I'm missing something. It's a more expressive interpretation than most that is for sure. For another interesting and insightful listen, also check out Rachmaninoff's own recording of the 3rd concerto, although some material is missing and the tempi are almost absurdly fast, presumably so it would fit on one side of a record.
6305609705|1.0|I've tried so hard to like this movie, even going so far as to watch the damn thing twice.  In short:  It's boring as hell.
B000286S8S|2.0|Where is Cabo Wabo or In and Out? And come on, Me Wise Magick? (I think I spelled the last title right) Anyway, this is a pathetic attempt at trying to give VH or just rock fans the &quot;best of both worlds&quot;, and they miss the boat.  <br /> If you are going to give a best then look at the band's essence, not the hit factor and there lies the album.  <br />  <br /> Nice try Eddie, by the way Eddie... just face it Adam Jones has buried you.
6305014140|4.0|Remember when you used to pick up a comic book and get lost in the (sometimes guilty) pleasure of art and violence? Remember all the compelling, tormented characters? Ninja Scroll is just like picking up a comic book of twenty years ago.<br /><br /> Gone are the huge eyes, the pretty girl/boy magic tricks, the colorful, flashy outfits. Ninja Scroll is old-school anime. Because of the spouting blood and strange, almost mysoginistic sex/sexual scenes, this is for MATURE ADULTS ONLY. But this is not hentai by any stretch of the imagination. Any sexual scenes are brief, and Ninja Scroll has one of the best love stories/romantic couples EVER. I dare you not to cry, or at least be deeply moved, at the scene toward the end with Jubei and Kagura.<br /><br /> Jubei is a wandering ninja who accidentally gets caught up in a battle between ninja clans. While neither group is &quot;good,&quot; one is evil. The ninja serving the Shogun of the Dark Lord have some peculiar and nasty tricks up their sleeves. The action in Ninja Scroll happens so fast that second and third viewings are a mandatory delight. Really mesmerizing. The beautiful Kagura transforms from geisha to ninja. Kagura is strong, but very feminine in the Japanese sense. The Japanese voice actor of Jubei is exceptional.
B00004Z459|1.0|There are a bunch of 1's, and there are a bunch of 5's. The people that have given this CD a 1 most likely would have given it a ZERO if it were an option.<br />The people who gave it a 5 are one of two things, or a combination of both:<br />a) a teenager, without any clue about what good music is all about (ive been there, and im not holding it against you...it's just that, when you get older, you also get some taste)<br />b) very very immature intellectually (if you find anything pleasing in this music, you have the mind of a 15 year old...even if you happen to be 30 years old physically).<br />The lyrics are non-existent...<BR>The music is uncomfortably bad...<BR>The singing is nothing to talk about...especially that really bad rapper, and the horrible parts where the guy sings like he's a Backstreet Boy...<br />If you have any sense of what good music is, you wont be listening to this. If you are mentally stuck in high school (unaware of what is going on in the world around you), then youll find this really pleasing, and probably post a review right after mine, giving this CD a 5 and spouting off a bunch of garbage about how cool the music is, and it's so hardcore.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I'm very happy many people made good reviews for this film, many people(including young people like me) who have never seen western films because they were boring,now i have changed my  mind, thanks tarantino for homage in kill bill films. i am 27 years old, and honestly  saw GBU last year for the very first time and before Kill Bill was released....my uncle told me it was a good film and i rented. i was blown away. especially for Morricone's music at the end of the film. when i saw Kill Bill Vol.2 i recognized the leone style, and Morricone music all over kill bill. i was never so excited in theaters all my life, thanks tarantino.... <br /> <br />This dvd is a good released, i'm from peru and i ordered from Amazon, and i was very impressed by the extra features and the package. <br />it has 5.1 sound and the video transfer is really good. <br />I recommend this dvd for any young people who have never seen a western film, you will be astonished. <br />Buy it!!! <br />
B000002LCX|4.0|This album doesn't seem to get the praise that some of their others do, but I can't understand why. Personally, as far as their proper albums go, I like it second best after &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;, and this is similar to that. The only songs I would call hits here are &quot;Girlfriend In A Coma&quot; and &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot;, but &quot;Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before&quot;, &quot;Unhappy Birthday&quot;, and &quot;Death Of A Disco Dancer&quot; are all good too. I also like the mellow closer &quot;I Won't Share You&quot;, which is typical &quot;Morrissey&quot;. Overall I'd say this final studio album of theirs is essential &quot;Smiths&quot;.
0743454529|5.0|What a thought-provoking experience this book has been.  There are no easy answers for any of the characters and the story line is beautifully developed, with all the unexpected twists.  Last but not least, it brings to the forefront the importance of organ donation and the miracles that can happen in spite of what medical theory tells us.
B000002PH1|4.0|When this was released I had such a crush on &quot;Belinda Carlisle&quot;, ok so I still do. This album which was her most popular, is just as good as her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; as far as I'm concerned. Included are the hits &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, &quot;Circle In The Sand&quot;, and of course &quot;Heaven Is A Place On Earth&quot;, but I also like &quot;World Without You&quot; and &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;. Plus there's her cover of &quot;I Feel Free&quot;, which is obviously more pop than the original from &quot;Cream&quot;. Overall this album is one of the best from the late 80's pop scene, and definitely the best of &quot;Belinda&quot;.
B00005JMYG|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell and Christina Appelgate but they just werent thinking when they made this movie.  Anchorman goes beyond dumb comedy and into complete stupidity.  Very sad for the amount of good actors that made appearances.
B000077VPU|1.0|The DVD is a dissapointment. Over 1/2 of the music footage is missing. <br />  <br /> It's a &quot;tribute&quot; concert, yet the biggest tribute to Freddie, Extremes medley of Queen songs (which is BY FAR the show stealer) and them performing &quot;Love of my Life&quot; w/ Brian May are stricken from the DVD. <br />  <br /> Do yourself a favor, hunt down the VHS copy. If you threw out your VCR, it's worth buying another one to watch it with.
B0002234LS|3.0|This movie is not near as good as I was hoping. <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of both Johnny Depp and John Turturro, however I have to say this movie has the same plot of so many movies that have come out in the past few years. <br /> <br />The movie itself has so few elements of horror. There are no genuine scares, and the movie never truly gains any momentum to make the ending seem worth it. <br /> <br />The fact is that acting-wise this movie is very entertaining. Story-wise it?s the same story that has been hashed out since ?Fight Club? and Hollywood?s latest trend of schizo-chic. <br /> <br />If you?re a Depp or a Turturro fan, it?s cool, if not, don?t bother. There are plenty of other better movies out there than this.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000005J48|5.0|The music and perforamance are so sensually played and achingly beautiful, the hairs on my neck and arms stand up on end. Listen to the opening track and tell me this is not sensually intriguing. Yes, tango is a very sensual art form and this CD is great for those very intimate moments. Of course, sex aside, the music is nothing short of a miracle unto itself. That I was to discover this CD just last year meant I was without it for 7 years since it was released. My life is richer for this and other Piazzolla works done by Kremer.<br /> This CD has become one of those \\"island\\" CDs that you would take if you wer so to become deserted on one. You should be so lucky!
B00023BLXK|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the first one; I guess the sequels really aren't ever as good!
B000286S8S|3.0|I went ahead and shelled out the $20.00 bucks to get this two disk set of VH David Lee Roth-Sammy Hagar era compilation. Why, I ask myself? I guess I, like the rest of us fans have been waiting, What, at least 8 years to get new material from them. First DLR was back in the band, then canned again, then Sammy was canned, then Sammy is back in again. VH I feel has pissed alot of their fans off over the years for doing all this crap. This new 2 cd set is good, if you dont have the original remastered individual albums ( I mean CDs). You get most of the DLR era songs, Erruption, Jamies Crying, Dance the Night Away, Jump, Panama, etc. YOu also get the Sammy era stuff, like When its love, Dreams, Finish what ya started, Top of the world, etc... Also, 3 new songs, in which I cant really tell yet if I like them. Eddie's tone has changed so much over the years. He is into that low end chug thing, that is so popular nowadays, so where is the Brown Sound? All in all, its a pretty decent cd compilation. I just cant stand to hear Hagar sing Jump or Panama, or Aint Talkin Bout Love, in which you have the pleasure of listening to on this cd set. I guess I couldnt stand to listen to DLR sing the Sammy era songs either, so there you go....
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy is with little doubt the greatest epic scifi series put to film. I myself have owned several versions on VHS but with time and use they degrade and picture quality suffers. I personally can't afford my own theater or to purchase film prints of this classic so the DVD will be the final incarnation of perfection for me.<br /><br /> Granted these are not truely the &quot;originals&quot; screened in my childhood and yes GL has used some modern technology to twist facts and embelish some but these small parts don't take to much away from the whole.<br /><br /> I eagerly await the release of this DVD box so that my children in 15 years will be able to watch the exact picture perfect film I grew up on.<br /><br /> Five stars!*****
6305280762|2.0|I bought this in tandem with &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (the granddaddy of all the disaster flicks, still a favorite and superbly restored on DVD) but I was less than pleased with &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; on DVD. If memory serves, several small but relevant scenes are missing: why Paul Newman's architect character was away at the beginning of the film (He was hoping to design an environment-friendly community in the Pacific Northwest and chuck the big-city life); what exactly Robert Wagner's job was (The Glass Tower's PR man) and why only one of the three scenic elevators was working (A dock strike in Japan held up delivery of the extra elevator cables, as William Holden explains). Also, Maureen McGovern's rendition of &quot;We May Never Love Like This Again&quot; is truncated. Finally, a lot of the background soundtrack seems murky. OK, this is very geeky stuff, but I remember this movie well, and a guilty pleasure should be enjoyed in all of its restored, cheesy glory. I love this flick, but am not crazy about this version.
0743490304|5.0|Perfect for the beach, a plane trip, or at hand on your night table. Just don't believe all of the nay-sayer reviewers.<br /><br /> Yes, some of the incidents in &quot;Deception Point&quot; really stretch believablity, but they're not totally impossible to swallow, especially since this book is so confidently and artfully written. Say what you will: Dan Brown has an great gift for words, sentence-structure, and just the perfect amount of detail; not to mention his wonderfully overactive imagination. Forget Michael Crichton. Dan leaves him sitting in the dust. &quot;Deception Point&quot; is a pure, escapist, sci-fi/political thriller.<br /><br /> I was particularly terrified and intrigued by Brown's gruesome depiction of what it's like to freeze to death. VERY well-researched. And the whole ancient meteor/extraterrestrial fossil storyline was also utterly fascinating. Character development could have been a bit improved, but it actually beats &quot;DaVinci Code&quot; by a longshot in that department. You'll especially love-to-hate the President's despicable, chain-smoking advisor, Marge Tench. &quot;Deception Point&quot; is also a lot less episodic than &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;. And, yes, &quot;Deception Point&quot; would make a blockbuster movie.<br /><br /> Let's hope Dan Brown doesn't run out of steam, and keeps the page-turners coming, without falling into the bestseller trap that eventually entices good authors to start cranking out junk.
B000002GYI|5.0|What a record. How absolutely visionary, how ridiculously influential, how timeless, how international, how beautiful, how artistic, how technological, and how German all at the same time. <br />  <br /> &quot;Computer Love&quot; is my favorite track on the record. I never tire of that song; I mean who can't sympathize with this song's protagonist? The mere fact that I am typing this review of that song and this album should give you an indication of how ahead of its time this project was.
B00005JM20|3.0|This movie definitely has its moments, but it pales in comparison to any of his other work.  If you purchase the movie expecting Black Adder or Mr. Bean type antics, then you'll be disappointed.  Still worth having in my collection of Rowan's works, but not his best in my opinion.
B000002KKD|5.0|I remember how captivated I was when I first heard this album, and how impressed I was by the B52s sound: it was part pop, part surf, part 60s, part &quot;Monster Mash&quot;. Words cannot express how in awe I was of Fred's Jersey-tinged, slightly effeminate bark, and Cindy and Kate's esoteric harmonies. But I can tell you that this album made me learn how to dance because I couldn't resist it. It also made me howl with laughter at the sheer joy and pleasure of their tunes. Everyone has their favorites but give me &quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot; anytime. Even their all-too-short cover of &quot;Downtown&quot; was nothing less than inspired brilliance and fun.  <br />  <br /> This album is so friendly and fun that to not like it is, in my opinion, snobbery. So come down of your high horse and pick up this CD.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I told all of you, when the US theatrical cut came out a few months ago, to WAIT, because there is a super edition coming later this year. And here it comes folks............. <br /> <br />I see a massive 4 disc set, that likely has all the bells and whistles that my old special edition laserdisc has and even then some. The artwork appears to be done in a skin crawling red and black, with the faces of all four actors behind each disc and the box itself looks to be the size of a 200 page novel. <br /> <br />September 7th is approaching.........Is your ammo loaded? Are your first aid kits ready? Do you have an escape plan if you should be spotted by the undead? Prepare yourself folks, if we act quickly and without emotion, we may be able to survive.
B000002HPT|4.0|First of all, this is not Dream Theater's best record, but I don't believe it's their worst either!  I have to admit, it took a long time for me to give this album a chance, but I'm glad I did.  Basically, what I get out of Falling Into Infinity is that this is the record that Queensryche has been striving for!  If you'll listen to QR's last three albums, then you'll hear the similarites in the sound.  The difference between Dream Theater and Queensryche is, that Dream Theater can actually pull off a nu-metal/rock sound!  Rest easy, because there is no rapping in it thank goodness!  I agree with one of the earlier reviewers that said this is some of the best vocal melodies the band has done!  Dream Theater expiermented with a modern sound and pulled back from their signature technical rants!  Falling Into Infinity is a stripped down version of Dream Theater, but these guys couldn't play average if they had to!  This is a great album to add to your collection!
B0002234LS|3.0|I think this movie is better than what the other reviewers are giving it, but they're not far off the mark. A movie about a writer being haunted by a gruff Southerner who accuses the writer of plagiarism. Meanwhile, the writer is going through a tough divorce. <br />  <br /> Weaknesses: <br />  <br /> 1.) Tepid directing, few pop-up thrills to even justify it being a thriller. <br /> 2.) Obvious, obvious twist. And also nonsensical, as the whole premise of the plagiarism in relation to the &quot;Secret Window&quot; story is rendered irrelevant. <br /> 3.) One grotesque and infuriatingly violent act performed on an adorable and very hugable doggie. Not shown, but the aftermath is enough. If you're a dog lover, you will be ticked off at this movie. <br /> 4.) Didn't we see this story before in numerous other Stephen King novels and adaptations(ie, the Shining?) There is one scene towards the end that is a direct rip off of a famous scene in the Shining that was parodied in a famous scene in a Simpsons Halloween special. <br /> 5.) The characters are in one way or another, repugnant. You root for the bad guy. Maybe that's the point. <br />  <br /> Strengths: <br /> 1.) Johnny Depp is campy enough to pull it off. <br /> 2.) It has some funny moments, funny dialogue. <br /> 3.) The movie sticks to its guns and stears clear of a &quot;Hollywood&quot; ending (although, one could argue the &quot;dark twist&quot; ending is the &quot;new&quot; Hollywood ending). Like I said, you root for the bad guy... <br />  <br /> All in all, not a bad movie, but not a particularly good one either. Rent it from Netflix or watch it at a friend's house. Only buy it if you like seeing dead dogs, or you're in love w/ Johnny Depp, or you're a Stephen King collector. <br />
B00005JMYG|5.0|Will Farrell is brilliant. His comedy talent reaches new heights as he makes you totally believe he's Ron Burgundy. The laughs are non-stop. If you don't understand this kind of comedy, then why go watch the movie? I'll never understand why all of the wackos have to come out of the woodwork to criticize a movie that's supposed to be *entertainment*. Jeez people. Kicking a dog off a bridge in a movie for laughs is not animal cruelty because it never happened. You can see plain as day that the &quot;dog&quot; is a stuffed animal. Don't we have enough politically correct garbage in our society already without someone putting down a comedy for its attempt at laughs? I mean, what has society come to? You have to get a certain kind of humor to watch this movie. It's the same kind of humor Will Farrell has been doing since SNL, so if you don't understand it by now you shouldn't be watching it in the first place. I thought the movie was hilarious. It's Will Farrell at his best and I definitely plan on owning this one. The all-star cast finishes out this movie. It's irreverent, stupid and downright ridiculous in spots, but that's what you expect from an off-the-wall comedy such as this. I give this movie 5 stars because I laughed constantly through the whole thing. The bar scene where Will played the flute was priceless. People will look back on this movie as a comedic masterpiece.
B00018D44U|1.0|I like beer. All sorts of beer. I enjoy everything from featherweight glacier brews to 10W40 consistency stouts. Each provide a different texture, drinking method, and, dare I say, intoxication.  <br /> One's preference of beer is also different between each person. Some may solely prefer wheat beers. Some only prefer a light beer. Many couldn't care what they drink most of the time. However, I can vouch for anyone even slightly versed for the art of beer when I say this: Michelob Ultra is an abomination, if not heresy.  <br /> So, if you can't already tell where I'm going, this is the Michelob Ultra of music. That's as good as I'm gonna do with this one. &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; and Michelob Ultra belong together. Flavorless, lighter than air beer coupled with flavorless, lighter than air music. Sit at home counting carbs to this, as far away from society as you can. Maybe go rent &quot;How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days&quot; while you're at it. I'll be enjoying the extra 30 calories in my can of Guinness while running along the third rail. I might die young, but it'll all be worth it knowing I wasn't listening to Norah Jones and drinking ultra-light beer at the time.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|About a month ago I decided to purchase the new Killswitch Engage album. I had never really been that much into them but I thought they had good potential from what I had heard of them. WEll, I was seriously disapointed with the lead singer and how all they felt all their songs needed to have a p-ssy sounding chorus.  <br /> <br />Well a month later, I purchased this cd, and I can this is the cd I was looking for! I got great, heavy, Gothenberg(loosely) riffs, with amazing drums and breakdowns that make you want to get crazy. And surprise! I don't have some black dude giving his best Clay Aiken impression about 1:30 into each song!  <br /> <br />So basically, if you think KSE is cool but you get sick of all the wuss singing, you'll love this. Didn't give it 5 stars because the middle gets somewhat monotonous...but overall probably the best metal cd i've bought in awhile.
B00005JMYG|4.0|If you are looking for a good laugh, go see 'Anchorman'. Mostly you will laugh out of sheer stupidity and randomness. Wil Ferrel and Christina Applegate also give great performances. Go see it ;)
0679428895|5.0|Ok, ok, I have read the rest of the reviews of this book and will admit that it is not the fastest-moving book out there.  But come on, folks, has there been a better book in recent past as far as its ability to actually transport the reader into the story?  Not in my mind.  The sense of what was coming was palpable, and the efforts and struggles of the Aquarius in the face of so many difficulties were so realistic.  I could smell the sulfur, feel the heat, the dust, the dirt.  I could see the characters in each scene.  I only felt that the book lost a bit of steam when the volcano erupted (no pun intended).  I felt that the escape efforts actually dragged on a bit.  But just a bit. <br />One of the best books I have read in some time.  It takes some work to get through it, but is is well worth the effort.
B0000844I8|1.0|I was expecting a better movie.  I found out that this film has a large following of sci-fi fans, and all of the fans of the movie that I know tell how great it is.  Some even go to get autographs of the actors from the movie because of the great job that they did.  I borrowed this film from one of these sci-fi fans, and was very disappointed with Stargate. <br /> <br />The whole plot was bad.  The characters were all one dementional.  Lots of stuff didn't make sense.  Even the whole idea around the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Sure, I do admit that there is a possibilty that aliens built the pyramids (which is very, very, VERY unlikely), but the idea that the Egyption god Ra created all civilization on earth to enslave is absurd. <br /> <br />My arguements probably don't sound very convinceing against the movie, but I don't feel the movie is worth writing about, even if it is listing the bad stuff...
B00008AWOD|5.0|In placebo's latest album, they have dared ventured into some new styles, and convincingly revisited some old. Most songs on this CD have a somewhat mellow feel to them, but there are also some hard hitting songs. There is a great amount of variety throughout. Stefan's bass lines are pounding and inventive (with the occasional fill), Steve is better than ever on drums, and Brian Molko's voice has got considerably better as their albums have progressed. Here's what i think of the songs on the album: <br /> <br />1. Bulletproof Cupid - Great instrumental to give the opening a hell of a kick. Brian's guitar work is very good. One of the heaviest songs on the album. 9/10 <br />2. English Summer Rain - Good use of synths and guitar, but after a while does get repetitive due to the same sets of lyrics used throughout. 7/10 <br />3. This Picture - The 2nd Single. One of my favourites! intresting intro with the vocal effect, and good use of the keyboards on the chorus. The bassline is also insanely catchy! 10/10 <br />4. Sleeping with ghosts - Another one of my favourites. The album title song features guitar over-lapping work, and very good lyrics. 9.5/10 <br />5. The Bitter End - The 1st single. I didn't like this at first, but it's grown on me. It's very catchy, and good to sing along to. 8.5/10 <br />6. Something Rotten - The most intresting song on the album. Also happens to be one of the best. It doesn't sound like it should belong on this album, but it works imensely and it fits! 10/10 <br />7. Plasticine - I first heard this when someone got me the 'special needs' single and the lounge version of this song was on there. Personally i think that is much better, im not too impressed with the album version. 6/10 <br />8. Special Needs - This is one of the best songs they have ever done. The lyrics are astounding, the guitar and bass work is fantastic, the drums fits with the song like a dream, and piano (on the chorus) is class. Pure masterwork. 15/10 <br />9. I'll be yours - The lyrics are good, so are the drums, but it's nothing special. 7/10 <br />10. Second Sight - This is old placebo, re-incarnated with molko's new singing style mapped over the top of it. It lets us know that the old rock 'n' roll placebo are still alive. 9/10 <br />11.Protect me from what i want - This is intresting. Some may link it back to the old style placebo, but i think it might be another direction they could go in. Might be hinting of whats to come on the next album 8/10 <br />12. This is too slow for my liking. Good lyrics and piano though. 6/10 <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you are a placebo fan, get it now! if you have only heard a few of their songs, get it now! if you despise them in everyway, get it anyway!
0312958455|5.0|This is the fourth installment in the Harry Bosch series, and overall it was excellent.  Fast paced, action packed, a terrific thriller.  Harry still has S#@t for taste in woman, but that is actually par for the course in this genre.  But, overall, this is a great story.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|Stanley Kubrick's 1975 film adaptation of Thackeray's novel by the same title.  It is a narrative epic of an empvorsished Irish upstart (Ryan O'Neil) whose ostracism sets him off on adventurous journeys into the high and low society of 18th century Europe. Although the acting is somewhat uneven, the force of the narrative is brought through more by Kubrick's brilliant stylized sceneries and moving music than acting talent.      Ryan O'Neil as the lead character is probably the weakest part of the film. His acting skills aren't really suited for a period film such as this one. His Irish accent starts sounding more and more American as the film progresses. His expressions also tend to be more reserved than they should be in certain scenes. The screenplay is well paced and the cinematography is impeccable. Shot in natural light, Kubrick gives the audience a lush sequence of images that capture the individual themes of the story. One minor flaw is some of the music selections. Although the use of Schubert's chamber works are well suited to the scenes and their themes, the music is out of context for a film dealing with 18th century Europe. Schubert was a romantic composer in the 19th century. The romantic movement in music came over 30-40 years after the setting of this story through the work of Ludwig Van Beethoven. In contrast, the film is set in the late 18th century during which the musical styles were Baroque (Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, etc.) and Roccocco (Mozart, Haydn, etc.) The film's choice of music would therefore be equivalent to including music by Van Halen in a drama set during the early 1950s.       Apart from these minor details, the film is a masterpiece of directing and cinematography. I strongly recommend it. If you like this film, I would also recommend Riddley Scott's first feature film, \\"The Duellists\\", with Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel. Scott uses similar montages and cinematographic styles as Kubrick for this film which is set in Napoleanic France.
B000001IPL|5.0|Ahh, Smash. What can I say about the Offspring's last record with Epitaph that hasn't been said already? Catchy, fast, furious, funny, a '90s alt-punk classic. I've owned this album since seventh grade (I'm 18 now), and it never gets old. Although I still like Offspring's new material (though not as much), they will never top Smash. It's their Dookie, their Dark Side, their Master Of Puppets, their Rage Against The Machine, their Dirt, their... well you get the idea. <br />  <br /> I was gonna do a song-by-song anaylsis, but so many reviews have already done that for me, so it would just be redundant. So I'm just gonna name my favorites (though they're all very good): <br /> NITRO (YOUTH ENERGY): A fast, furious, rocker that sets a good tone for the rest of the album. It was a song for Generation X. <br /> BAD HABIT: The ultimate ode to road rage. <br /> GOTTA GET AWAY: My favorite on the album. A great anthem for paranoia, right up there with Green Day's classic &quot;Basket Case&quot;. <br /> COME OUT AND PLAY: Everyone's heard this one on the radio. But it never seems to get old to me. Great guitar work, and you gotta love the line &quot;Hey-ey, don't pay no mind, if you're under 18, you won't be doing any time, hey-ey-ey, come out and play!&quot; A great '90s alt-rock anthem. <br /> SELF ESTEEM: Also another radio staple about being an a lousy relationship and not doing anything about it because, well, &quot;I've got no self esteem!&quot;. Some funny lyrics, mid-tempo beat. Good stuff. <br /> KILLBOY POWERHEAD: This is a cover, the most punkish song on the album. I can't figure out what the lyrics are about though. <br /> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU: Hey-ey, this one's got a ska beat. Actually meaningful lyrics here, about having to watch a friend struggle with drug addiction and wishing you could do something about it. <br /> SMASH: Great closer, love the inspirational lyrics of the chorus. <br />  <br /> If you want to hear some really good alt-punk music from back in the day, pick this one up. You won't regret it.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|After Madonna released her debut self-titled album in 1983, most critics labeled her a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot;. Nobody expected her career to last long. However, her great presence started becoming more public in the last half of 1984. Her performance of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; at the First Annual MTV Music Awards in 1984 made musical history. Later, she released her follow-up &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, which propelled her from dance singer to superstar. Though her public antics sparked tremendous controversy, she became a great role model to girls everywhere, especially the liberal society. Her dance moves, her music, her wardrobe, and her antics continue to influence a generation. <br />  <br /> With the help of producer Nile Rodgers (former Chic guitarist), &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; resulted as a masterpiece that is now hailed as one of the greatest 1980's albums. The smash hit single of the same name begins this. Though the songs are less funk and more keyboard/ synthesizer dance (not techno), every song is as catchy as the next. She experiments with different levels of upbeat that offers a great musical journey. Every song defines 1980's pop music. Through the album's dance theme, she fits two slower songs without eliminating the quality: &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot; and &quot;Shoo-Bee-Doo&quot;. Madonna performs her lyrics wonderfully, blending perfectly with the individual theme. Her vocal expressions wonderfully add the extra catchy upbeat or ballad flavor. Though her lyrics are less repetative than her previous album, they continue being joyous for singing along, namely &quot;Material Girl&quot;. Such great music quality earns its spot as the beginning of a pop music revolution. <br />  <br /> &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is a must-have for all Madonna fans. This classic album will surely continue pleasing many listeners as it has since its release. Those who can find the original 1984 record should buy it to make any Madonna collection complete.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I started out buying the Rock in Rio dvd, and let me tell you, that rocks so hard, there is no other word to describe Iron Maiden but awesome...every song on Brave New World rocks harder than the last, even though i have to say the Wicker Man is the best out of all...but seriously, get this cd, it's worth every penny, you will NOT be sorry!  and while you're at it...pick up your copy of rock in rio on dvd or cd!
B0001XAPX8|2.0|The Human Stain has a dream cast, but each star is shockingly miscast.  Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman lead the list of Oops, I shouldn't be here, but are closely followed by Gary Sinise and Ed Harris.  So mujch talent, so sadly wasted.  i actually felt embarassed for Hopkins.  Better luck next  time!
B000286S8S|5.0|These tracks have been remastered and sound awesome!  I'm sure someone is going to complain about certain songs not being on here, but all-in-all I think the selection is great.  If you like Van Halen and are a true fan of quality produced music...this is a great album.  I just wish they had more than three new tunes!  Van Halen needs a new album (while they still like each other..joke).
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I however am completely in the middle on this movie. I thought the names of the charcters were really cheesy. &quot;Evan&quot; and &quot;Kaley&quot; sound like they should be on All my Children. I know a lot of people name their kids those name now adays, and they are cheese balls. Same as if you name your kid Hayley or Emma or Conner or anything that end in &quot;-den or -ton&quot;. Anywho, thatkind of took me out of the movie. And another thing before I forget, I went to college, and I can tell you that his fat roommate would not be getting any girls except big old internet girls, not the hot ones he has in the movie.  <br />  <br /> As for the movie, did no one notice that Kelso was not even in the movie for 30 minutes? I mean, I got things to do, they needed to hurry up a little bit, and save me some of the drama. And they didn't develop the character of the fat kid enough either. Not the fat roommate, but the fat buddy.  <br />  <br /> Seriously, besides that the movie was OK. I thought that it was a good time killer, but an extremely unoriginal idea. Didn't anyone ever watch Quantam Leap, or those other Sci-Fi movie about this sort of thing? I didn't either, but I know it is an old idea
B00001R3GI|5.0|If I were marooned on an island and had to take one recording with me &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; would be my choice. Released in 1972, I was 12 years old when I got this double lp in my hands. At the time, it was a disappiontment compared to &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; I suppose it had something to do with the more muddy production quality as compared to the previos lp. However as I listened more and more to &quot;Exile&quot; it absolutely eclisped &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. In fact I look at this lp as the Stones love letter to the the various genre of American music that influenced them: Blues, Country, Gospel, R&B and Rock and Roll. No serious lover of music should be without this recording in their collection. Much time has passed since 1972 and now and this lp from the opening riff of &quot;Rocks Off&quot; to the mad ending climax of &quot;Soul Surviver&quot; and everything in the middle still get my juices flowing. <br />
0792844882|3.0|You should absolutely buy this DVD. It is cheap, and don't forget Gina Gershon gives the performance of a lifetime. This probably has the worst acting ever in it. I mean Nomi Malone, wow, she is a bad actress. But did we mention Gina Gershon is in it. So is the guy from Twin Peaks.
0064409422|5.0|This is an excellent book for teaching classic themes in literature to 5th and 6th graders. The symbolism and vivid detail are excellent as well. I use this book every year with my class! <br /> <br />The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is an amazing book by C.S Lewis. It is about a magical land inside of a wardrobe in an English countryside home. C.S Lewis was very creative to put a portal to an entire magical land inside of a wardrobe! I loved all the detail that the author put into it and it was a very creative book. I also enjoyed following Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy on all of their exciting adventures around Narnia.  <br /> <br />One of my favorite parts was when Aslan (the true king and a lion) goes to the witches castle and breaths life onto all of the stone people. My favorite character in the book was Peter because be showed good skills like leadership, courage, love, and loyalty just to name a few. On the other hand my least favorite character in the book would definantly have to be the witch because she terrified the entire country and she turned people into stone. <br /> <br />The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is only second book in a series of seven books. Overall it was one of the best books I have ever read and I hope you will read it too!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Unbelievably comprehensive, unblinking documentary of the second World War with original footage and first hand accounts from the participants many of whom are no longer with us. <br />Sir Laurence Olivier's narration set the excellence bar high for all documentary voice-overs to have followed since.  A must for War historians and Documentary buffs. <br />10/10, Five Star, the Best.   <br />Watch this and learn that War is Hell.   <br />
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I finally got to see this movie and i have to say I still can't stop thinking about it.  I love everything about it, the acting the story the setting.  I loved the movie so much that I am getting ready to read the book now and will buy this DVD to add to my collection.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Just a warning to those of you who haven't seen this film: Some of the people who have posted reviews below have been complete jerks and given away the ending without warning! Someone has even given away the ultimate spoiler in their title! Personally, I think this is unfair, so be warned.      Otherwise, this is a great movie -- at least in my opinion. Some people find it dull and slow-moving. But if you decide to invest in it, be sure to get Anchor Bay's 99-minute \\"extended version,\\" which comes with the expensive Limited Edition. Anchor Bay's transfer is, as always, superb. Though it would have been nice if they could have included the commentary track with Christopher Lee and director Robin Hardy that appears as an extra on the Region 2 disc.
B00014TJ6Q|3.0|One of his best albums, and I think &quot;Faster&quot; is the best song.
B00006LSM3|4.0|George Harrison's legendary career comes to a close with this posthumous release, titled &quot;Brainwashed.&quot; This album is oozing with the production style of Jeff Lyne, the ELO & Traveling Wilbury's musician who has brought success to several veteran rock performers with his skills. Much of the production on this was done after George's death, and occasionally the production seems to overpower Harrison's diminished voice. Still, George sings adequately for this type of blues/folk material, and he even closes the album with some Hindu chanting, assisted by his son. The lyrics on this album are excellent, as is the folk cover of Between The Devil & The Deep Blue Sea. The album title and lyrics are quite revealing, and George may have saved this album for the time when he knew he would be returning to spirit, as the &quot;Mind Controllers&quot; who run our society probably would not have been too kind to George if he had released this while incarnate. The track &quot;Rising Sun&quot; seems to sum up the theme of the album - spiritual victory and release from the brainwashing and darkness humans face on Earth. This is one former Beatle's album that I really liked, although I will say that I would have given it all 5 stars if it had some more memorable hooks to reach a wider audience. Those who like classic rock, blues, and folk music are likely to enjoy this album.
B0000CGV00|5.0|...of the creative force that is Helene Grimaud.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />I know those three letters are not the most reviewerly ones that I could use to persuade you, but just listen to this disc and you will understand.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />The Master, Part, and Corigliano--ecclectic to say the least, but the two that are not yet lauded as loudly lurch ever closer to greatness as time moves on. And speaking of greatness (and I do not so easily part with that reviewerly word) Mrs Grimaud continues to build her case.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Her live performances have, in the past, far transcended her recorded ones. Yet this unique, thoughtful and dynamic Artist begins to shine through on this disc. I am no fan of DG for several reasons, but if they continue to work this well with Mrs Grimaud, more power to them.<br /><br />I recommend this CD as highly as I can. And though I have probably overused the phrase already, let me just say it one more time:<br /><br />WOW.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|When I first rented this movie I didn't know what to expect.  Sadly, I use the film Amelie to compare most french movies to.  After watching this one, I will for sure use this one to compare foriegn flicks.  It was amazingly great and I would recommend this to anyone at all. period.
B000286S8S|4.0|*Things they got right <br />-Remastered tracks sound great <br />-Almost 80 minutes of music per disc <br />-Decent but not perfect song selection (you can't please  <br />everybody) <br />-Cover art is great <br /> <br />*Improvements for VH Best of V3.0/Things They Messed Up on V2.0 <br /> <br />-Running Order.  Should be a Dave disc and a Sammy disc.  Eruption is supposed to be after Running With the Devil and before You Really Got Me.  Chronological order would be fine. <br /> <br />-They cut-off at the end of Finish What Ya Started <br /> <br />-They included syrupy songs like Can't Stop Lovin' You, Not Enough (with Eddie's drunken piano disassembly intro), Dance the Night Away. <br /> <br />-They included a handful of live songs.  If you felt the urge, why not remaster and re-release the entire live album separately? And while you're at it, turn Sammy's volume up on the live tracks so it isn't so buried in the mix.  <br /> <br />-Could have included more of Dave's stuff: Ice Cream Man, D.O.A., Light Up the Sky, Somebody Get Me A Doctor, Take Your Whiskey Home, Show Your Love, Mean Street, Little Guitars...  Obviously not all of those, but a few.  This is the material that put them on the map. <br /> <br />-Could have included Intruder Intro on Pretty Woman <br /> <br />-Could have included other guitar solos like Cathedral, Spanish Fly (they're really short).  Not 316--it puts me to sleep. <br /> <br />If they did everything I said, you'd have four discs.  All in all, it's a worthwhile purchase. <br />
B00005QW5X|5.0|This movie is a 'shining star' in a world of banal tripe. I'm not going to tell you it's the best film ever made, however, you'd be hard pressed to get a five star rating out of me for any other movie. Star/Writer/Director John Cameron Mitchell takes you into the world of Hedwig... an imigrant from cold war era East Berlin. Describing Hedwig's story of heartache and betrayel through lyrical genius along with beautiful graphics and storyline. <br /> You literally fall in love with the character of Hedwig in this movie... and the claim &quot;You buy me the dress and I'll be more woman than man like you can stand&quot; becomes no idle threat. This coming from a straight man... or so I think... John Cameron Mitchell is one sexy beast in this movie and his supporting cast is very likeable, all of the acting is far above par. <br /> As for the soundtrack... in the words of a good friend... 'these are songs that David Bowie should be doing if he wasn't so busy playing heterosexual' The musical performances are riveting and hysterical fun. If you like musicals or just a movie that dares to be different this is a very heartwarming and entertaining venture, I highly reccomend it for anyone that thinks they have good taste. <br />
B00003CXFG|5.0|This was definately not what I've expected. I was prepared for something like Aliens(which I really hated since this is horror movie in all its glory, plus there was too much gore for me to stomach) but i was pleasantly surprised. This was the first time I liked the &quot;bad guy&quot;, frankly because he was so much more interesting than the others. Story kept me on the edge of my seat and I have to say I consider this one of the best science fiction movies I've seen in a while.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Britney Spears debuted in 1998 with her infamous, No. 1 and Grammy-nominated smash &quot;...Baby One More Time.&quot; Close behind her came Christina Aguilera in August 1999, the power-ballad voiced singer that eventually won Best New Artist at the Grammys that February, an award most agree should've been presented to Miss Spears. Christina (now simply nicknamed &quot;X-tina&quot;) came out in 2002 with her second full-studio release Stripped, and knocked the socks off most critics. Not only did she co-write the majority of the tunes on this sterling LP, but Aguilera sung with more power than she'd ever done previously (excluding the Grammy-winning collaboration of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;). Christina definitely delivered on Stripped! Recently, though, people are saying that Stripped is doing about a million sales better than Britney's November 2003 release In the Zone, but no wonder! Christina's Stripped hit shelves a year earlier than Britney's latest and Brit's In the Zone is only about a million behind after only 9 months since its release; but you must realize that this is officially Christina's second CD and Britney Spears is currently on her fourth. Tally how many sales Brit has had with Oops!...I Did It Again, Britney and In the Zone and you'll see Brit's sold a lot more (overall) than Christina Aguilera's Stripped. But Stripped takes Britney's biggest female rival closer and shows that Aguilera's 15 minutes of fame is just as worthwhile as Spears's. Congratulations Christina! 4 out of 5 stars. Great second album!

0783233477|3.0|Remove about half an hour of pregnant pauses and some unnecessary dialogue, and you'd have a really charming film, complete with good acting, an elegant setting, and nice cinematography. First, the pluses. Brad Pitt, a fine actor as well as a heck of an eyeful, gives a nuanced, rather endearing performance--first as an outgoing young hunk in a coffee shop, then as Death, who inhabits the body of said hunk in order to experience the world first-hand. &quot;Joe Black&quot; is a character who seems to know almost everything about everybody, yet he has no experience whatsoever of the basic five senses, or exactly how to behave in a social setting. (He's like a cross between a benevolent Big Brother and Kaspar Hauser.) Hence his amazement at the pleasures of peanut butter, swivel chairs, and lovemaking. Anthony Hopkins refrains from dining on the scenery and offers a balanced interpretation of a wealthy news magnate on the brink of death. The attractive Claire Forlani is good, if a bit twitchy, as Death's love interest, Jeffrey Tambor is moving as Hopkins' bumbling son-in-law, and the versatile Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as Hopkins' earnest and caring older daughter. On the minus side--if only Mr. Brest had tightened up the ending, and cut all the padding (yes, Mr. Pitt is gorgeous, but the closeups don't have to last ten minutes) and excess chatter--this could have been a wonderful film. As it is, it's certainly worth watching.
0393324818|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining books I have read on any subject. I love baseball, so I may have enjoyed it more than most, but I do not believe a love for the game is necessary to appreciate MONEYBALL. My wife will judge a book's merits by opening it up and reading a random paragraph to see if it piques her interest. She declared this book a winner after reading about gaudy save totals and inefficiencies in the market for closers. Even someone who has only a cursory knowledge of the game can understand that concept. <br /> <br />Lewis gives a good overview of the history of Sabermetrics and all the characters who helped derive the new formulas for evaluating performance. He also invokes Jim Bouton's BALL FOUR by introducing us to some of the characters in the game. Scott Hatteberg comes out smelling like roses, and will be remembered long after his undistinguished playing career has ended.  <br /> <br />Billy Beane is the main character in the book, and he is represented as a tortured revolutionary. The point is well drawn that as a general manager, Beane is consumed by the task of discovering his own antithesis, since Beane himself was a failed prospect of the antiquated methods of player evaluation. <br /> <br />MONEYBALL is a crash course in modern baseball and how the management of the game is changing during the present era. Scouts are being replaced by statisticians; field managers are sent to the top dugout step to appear commanding while awaiting orders from the general manager and his consortium of number crunchers. There is also a great analogy of the changing game of baseball in the '90's with the changes that Wall Street went through a decade prior, as the inefficiencies in the market were discovered and exploited. <br /> <br />There were several instances in reading this book that I was moved to laughter. Lewis has such a great command of his straightforward business style, that it comes as a surprise when he decides to point out an absurdity lurking just below the surface. This is a book for the shelf, to be enjoyed more than once. It will prove an enduring touchstone for future baseball executives, players, and fans, and possibly even stock brokers.
B000059HAI|5.0|Some of you younger movie-goers, may only know of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.<br /><br /> Forget it!<br /><br /> If you want to have the actual story of what &quot;really&quot; happened on December 1941, then you have to go back to this movie made in 1970.<br /><br /> &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; is a vision from both sides of the coin, not just the American one.<br /><br /> &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is more a love story in its context and has only one vision, the unilateral and unnecessary patriotic American one.<br /><br /> This is not history as it should be told.<br /><br /> &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; was the codename given by the Japanese fleet to its carrier pilots to start the attack on Pearl Harbor.<br /><br /> This is far less a shooting war movie, than an actual historic recreation of facts happening on a certain month, week, day and moment in 1941.<br /><br /> Everything is told, from the burocracy involved (slow at that, as usual), to the actual military decisions on both sides and on the ground.<br /><br /> The attack, when it comes, is a majestic recreation that, once watched side by side with the actual documentary footage available, makes you realize that were it in black & white, one could not distinguish its differences.<br /><br /> That's how accurate it is!<br /><br /> Expenses were not spared at all in doing this recreation. The aircraft used are all faithful reconstructions (a rarity!).<br /><br /> All the actors involved (American and Japanese) have played their roles with outmost accuracy and sense of drama.<br /><br /> The watcher is taken in and left wondering &quot;what next&quot;, even if he already knows the story. Not a moment passes in boredom.<br /><br /> This is another fine movie I would recommend for schools and war museums.<br /><br /> It is a movie for thinkers, not warmungers, and it is certainly not one for those who always love to wave flags around.<br /><br /> In other words, this is history, told at its best.told at its best.
B000002UCQ|5.0|(Actually, this is a 4.5 star rating.)<br /><br /> This is one of those soothing records that came out in the early Seventies, a new wave of calm comforting music replacing the angry chaos that had been so much a part of the late Sixties. Not only that, but it's a great debut album as well, proof that George was a great singer and songwriter in his own right. While he was being allowed only one or two songs on each album most of the time and having his material by and large ignored, he was creating the beautiful songs on this album. And it beautifully reflects his deep spiritual beliefs, some of them quite diverse, without being preachy, obnoxious, or sectarian. This is spiritual music far more so than it could be classified as religious music. Of the 18 songs on the original first two LPs of this album, I would only classify two as throwaways--&quot;I Dig Love&quot; and &quot;Apple Scruffs.&quot; I've also never really cared for &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; but apart from personal taste I would never consider it a throwaway or a weak number.<br /><br /> Maybe George felt like he had to overcompensate for the years he spent in the sidelines by putting an overkill of material on this his first album, not knowing when to quit. The final five tracks are that overcompensation. It's not that they're bad music or unlistenable, just that they don't fit in at all with the spiritual mood set by the 18 prior songs. They belong on another album; here they not only contribute nothing to the overall theme of the work but in fact actually detract from it. If you add to something that's already perfect, you often ruin it. To me, ATMP ends properly with &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot;; after having played the four endless unstructured jam sessions and &quot;It's Johnny's Birthday&quot; (a cute sweet tribute to his former bandmate, but could have been put somewhere else if it had to be included on this album at all) a few times, I'm pretty much set for life and don't need to suffer through them time after time. I know they're there, but don't want my listening experience of an otherwise flawless classic marred by five tracks that just sound like they belong on an entirely different album.ough them time after time.

B00005QZWI|2.0|Howard Shore had an immense undertaking for this project, and his final score is decent. The dark and ominous themes for full orchestra and chorus are effective in the movie, though somewhat contrived an un-original. Speaking of un-orginial, the other famous themes have their origins elsewhere as well. The triumphant Fellowship Theme can be heard during football season as the NFL Sunday Night TV theme. Crack open a hymnal and find &quot;This is My Father's World,&quot; whose first phrase is lifted directly for the Hobbit's theme. <br /> Aside from those disappointing steals, Shore does a good job with the background music to this movie. I would recommend this to fans of the movie, but not fans of original motion picture music. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible at all. However, I would not call this Academy-Award winning material by any means. Just a pretty good album.

0316096199|5.0|I am a tall, suburban, white male, roughly the same age as Ms. Sebold. I have a long commute to work, so I listen to many books while driving in my truck.  <br /> <br />I picked this one out by mistake, but I recognized something out of the ordinary, so I listened.  The author read it herself, which was powerful and compelling. I won't make any other comments on style or technique, which isn't the point. <br /> <br />The point is that this book opened my eyes to a reality which had been largely invisible.  You could say that the world is controlled by powerful people who are more like me than not.  By definition therefore, I am ignorant of the realities of people who are different than I am, particularly women who have experienced violence in their lives. <br /> <br />I'm better for having read (listened to) this book.   <br /> <br />Thank you for sharing it with me Alice.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Upon purusing the various five star reviews, my four out of five star rating my stick out to you like a sore thumb.  Well, I did this for two reasons:<br /><br />1)The Bonus features, while nice, are missing one essential element: the actors' thoughts.  You hear a lot of stuff from director Francis Ford Coppola.  But also, you hear way too much stuff from the producer, Mario Puzzo, etc.  These guys say way too much.  Francis Ford Coppola gets his due in the one documentry and comentary on all three movies.  I really enjoy what he had to say about his classic trilogy.  But I need to hear more from the actors.  While they do get some words in, we just don't hear nearly enough from them.  Sadly, Marlon Brando doesn't even appear on the bonus disc.  And guys like Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Andy Garcia, and the guy who played Fredo (sorry, but I can't remember his name), need their own actors' documentry and actors' comentaries on the movies that they appear in.<br /><br />2) Now don't get me wrong, I adore the Godfather Part III.  But it has one fatal flaw.  And that is god-awful acting by Sophia Ford Coppola.  The preformances by Pacino and Garcia are to be regarded with the highest honors, but this is heavily marred by Sophia Ford Coppola.  It seems to me like Francis Ford coppola's only flaw in directing is his nepotism.  If he would have been fair and had casted a better actress for the part, then the Godfather III would be as respected as the other two.<br /><br />That being said, I love the Godfather trilogy.  Everyone I know loves it just as much.  Even if you are not a movie buff, I can pretty much guarentee that you'll like the Godfather Saga.<br /><br />Now, I offer a brief overview of the three films:<br /><br />1) Ah, yes the ledgendary first installment of the Godfather Saga.  Many ledgendary scenes that are now parodied, respected, well known, and imitated come from this movie.  Marlon Brando delivers the best preformence of his very famous career.  Duvall's preformence as Tom Hagen is also one of my favorites.<br /><br />2) The second installment is the perfect sequel.  There's no doubt about it.  This installment compliments the first part so well, that I believe that it is greater than the first.  Al Pacino and Robert DiNero deliver great preformences, in my opinion the best of there careers.<br /><br />3) Overlooked in many ways, the final installment is a classic ending.  Aside from the flawed acting of Sophia Ford Coppola, the thrid part offers a Shakespearian tragic ending, much like the first two.  Andy Garcia should have won an oscar for his preformence.<br /><br />As a final word, if you are like me and highly admire the Godfather Saga, then read Macievelli's The Prince.  It'll go nicely with the Godfather.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|Have you ever watched an incredible movie, wanted to buy the soundtrack, taken a look at the songs on it and thought, &quot;What were they thinking?&quot; I know that this has been the case for me. Too often, good films have a below-average soundtrack, but, luckily, with &quot;Love Actually&quot;, the music people got it right! <br />  <br /> Unlike the music in many films, &quot;Love Actually&quot; does not shy away from well-known contemporary hits. Artists such as The Calling ('Wherever You Will Go'), Norah Jones ('Turn Me On'), Maroon 5 ('Sunday Love'), and Dido ('Here With Me') are all included on this soundtrack, as are more classic hits such as 'God Only Knows' by the Beach Boys and Joni Mitchell's exquisite 'Both Sides Now'.  <br />  <br /> There are three tracks I'm very glad were included on this soundtrack. First of all, who could forget Hugh Grant's dancing scene to 'Jump (For My Love)'? With that song on this CD, you won't forget soon! Olivia Gordon's unbelievable rendition of 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' is better than Mariah Carey's, and brings back memories of the classic auditorium scene at the end. Best of all, Billy Mack's so-bad-it's-good 'Christmas is All Around' is also here, so you can listen to one of the funniest remakes ever done. <br />  <br /> There is only one downside to this album. While Craig Armstrong's 'Glasgow Love Theme' is included on the soundtrack, his soaring main theme (played at the end, for instance) is not on the CD. I would rather have had that instead of the one track that is here, but it is still a great soundtrack. <br />  <br /> Finally, a movie has come out with a decent soundtrack that perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's not one song that is out of place, and they're here on this soundtrack so you can forever enjoy a time when the music producers got it right!
079284131X|5.0|Some say it's not scary, some say it's terrifying, all agree that it is an awsome movie. You don't even need to view this beautiful piece of cinema from a horror standpoint to see the greatness that bursts out of every frame like a nuclear blast of sunlight. It is just a great film to watch. Chucky doesn't scare me personally but I know people who can't even look at pictures of him without shrieking. Childs Play is a classic that is sure to live on forever. It's great, why else would it have spawned 3 sequels with a 4th on the rise?  <br />  <br /> What is great about this movie is that the Killer Doll does not come of looking cheasy or fake. The movie makes you think the doll is real and doensn't allow for those whiny ones to deflect their fear with humor. You know the ones I'm talking about. Every scene all you hear is &quot;HAHAHA he looks so fake! Oh, yea right that looked totally real, NOT! HAHAHA I'm so CHEAP!!!&quot; Yea, they are annoying.

B0001611DI|5.0|Are you in the mood for some Zombies?  Because they're definitely in the mood for you. This 1979 cult classic gore fest is definitely worthy of ownership if your a fan of the horror genre and not squeamish. The second installment in George A. Romero's Zombie trilogy sees the undead zombies seeking out live flesh once again. Once again Tom Savini the special effects genius and gore wizard pulls it all off with the right amount of blood and gore. Considering that \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" was very controversial at the time of its release, it seems tame by today's standards.     Anchor Bay has gone all out for this release. The picture and sound for this special Divimax Edition is dynamic to say the least. The picture is crisp and clear and sound options range from mono to 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS. This version is like nothing I've ever seen or heard before. The first time I saw this movie was at the drive-in, so the picture was average and the sound was crappy at best. Some people believe this movie was terribly bad, but yet it inspired dozen's of zombie films and it and continues to shock even today.     There are extra features and commentaries included and I found them to be quite informative and interesting. This incredible follow-up to Romero's classic \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" will continue to pull at your flesh. While trying to outwit the flesh eating Zombies, four people find refuge and lock themselves inside a shopping mall to get away from the undead.     Will the mall provide the protection from the gathering masses of Zombies or will they become the Zombies next meal?

B0000524CY|5.0|Horror movies today fall into distinctly one of two categories: Dumb and Good. Lately we horror fans have had a sort of Garden Of Delights, with movie upon movie being released in rapid succession. The trouble with this is that the majority of these releases fall squarely into the &quot;Dumb&quot; category (Wrong Turn, 13 Ghosts, Jeepers Creepers 2, The (new) Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and while they may be relatively entertaining, it is possible to sit through them all without even breaking a mild sweat.      Far rarer today are those movies that hearken back to the golden era of Horror - movies like &quot;The Blair Witch project&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot; and &quot;Ringu&quot; invoking memories of such classics as &quot;Don&quot;t look Now&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; - and these movies garner critical acclaim, as their three-decades-old counterparts did upon their first release, too.      The reason? Substance over Style. Look closely at any of the more recent critically acclaimed Horror flicks and you'll see a common trend - no oceans of blood, no deformed humanoids wielding axes, no silvery-white transparent blue-screen ghosties. Just solid acting, excellent direction and excellent production. Real Actors with Real Characters to portray in settings that are... ...well, just real.      &quot;The Exorcist&quot; falls firmly into this category; it is the original triumph of Substance over Style. There are no hi-end special effects here, nor is there any Hollywood Overstatement to muck up the proceedings with. For that reason alone the excellent performances, beautifully shot direction and exquisite scoring are allowed to shine through, and the movie is today, a whopping 31 years after its original release, and every bit as compelling and powerful as it was back in 1973.      The plot centres on Regan MacNeill (Linda Blair), the daughter of acclaimed actress Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn). A series of out-of-character episodes and violent behaviour lead her through a maze of conventional doctors to a Jesuit priest, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller). Recognising that she is possessed by a demon, the Church summons experienced Exorcist Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) to rid the child of her evil occupant.      It is a strong testament to the superficiality of the modern Academy Awards system that Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. Here is a performance with depth, truth and believability - she is a Mother, she is on the Edge. Burstyn's remarkable talent shines through in this picture and the fear and tension she herself creates is alone worthy of praise. Blair as Regan is good, she is a perfectly sweet and innocent creature as Regan, and in the scenes where she is being taken over by Pazuzu (the Demon), she displays a rare talent in child actors - the ability to create drama without histrionics. Miller as Karras is similarly excellent as the tortured, moody priest wrestling with his faith, and the scenes between him and his elderly Mother are simultaneously tender and grim. Von Sydow does a good job with the role of Merrin, but he's somewhat peripheral to the central core of the story.      Direction is superior. William Friedkin has used a sharp, choppy style of camerawork to suggest violence born out of normality, and it works beautifully here. The Party and medical Examination scenes set a wonderful tone for the last half of the movie, and the floaty, unstructured quality of Karras' Dream Sequence is a beautiful, haunting piece of film. The opening scenes in Iraq and the Exorcism itself draw some interesting parallels - monochromatic and stark, they compliment each other nicely and, in and of themselves, are excellent 'ends' to the movie.      The score is perfect, animal voices and sharp strings (as well as Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of Pazuzu, check her out alongside Joan Crawford in spaghetti western &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;) add an aural tension that's rarely been matched, and the whole production screams of professionalism. Here are masters of their Craft, and we're thrilled to be along for the ride.      The special effects may look hokey in places now, but this is directly the fault of those delightful Wayans boys and Mister Leslie Nielsen, legally plagiarising the Bile and Head-Turning scenes for their own juvenile ends.      The extra material is good, the 'Spider-Walk' scene is particularly grim, and the picture and sound quality are excellent. The extras on the DVD are nice, but they're not the point.      All in all, this is one of the most well-realised horror movies of all-time. Following the novel almost to the letter, and providing deep-fear immersion, I can highly recommend &quot;The Exorcist&quot; to all that are sick of seeing old &quot;Buffy&quot; cast members having their nipples photographed by Modern Hollywood.      Excellent.
0671027344|1.0|Wow. This was a trite piece of garbage. The prose is absoultley atrocious (yeah I know the author was trying to pull off the confessional letters of a young high school kid- but the character is supposed to be a smart writer.) The book explores the character's passive behavior is borderline autistic. And it's fine and great to have a male character that expresses emotion, but the kid cries every two pages. Jesus. <br />I can't believe I actually finished this crap. It's rare that you really read a truly awful book. It is too much of a time investment to read a whole novel without being pretty sure it's going to be good. But I fell for some of the hype surrounding the book. I should have known better. MTV lowers the discourse a little further.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby's \\"White Christmas\\" album should be the linchpin of every Christmas CD collection. Many of the inspired arrangements on this album were enjoyed by generations long gone by as they sat around their tinsel-laden Christmas trees during World War II. As the most famous singer in the world during that era, he was known as \\"Der Bingle\\" in German-occupied territories, a nickname that stayed with the Irish-American crooner throughout his life. Bing's recordings of \\"White Christmas,\\" \\"Adeste Fideles,\\" \\"Silent Night,\\" \\"Faith of our Fathers,\\" \\"Jingle Bells,\\" and \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" were part of a 78 rpm \\"Merry Christmas\\" set that was a huge seller in the 1940s. Of course his version of \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\" became the theme song for sailors and Marines in the South Pacific and the soldiers hunkered down in the trenches in Europe.      In the 50s, Der Bingle and the Andrews Sisters recorded \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" and that fast became another Crosby Christmas standard. His good friend Bob Hope introduced \\"Silver Bells\\" in the film \\"The Lemon Drop Kid\\" but Crosby's mellifluous version with Carol Richards is the song that should be used to ring in every holiday season. \\"Christmas in Killarney,\\" a tribute to Bing's ancestry is a lively arrangement that makes you want to do an Irish Christmas jig. A Christmas collection won't be compete without this CD, not just for the easy listening, but for the historic significance of the recordings.
B000286S8S|4.0|Seems everytime someone has a career spanning retrospective release, someone's GOTTA say &quot;Where's this?&quot; or &quot;How could you POSSIBLY put out a best of collection and NOT include...?&quot; Keep in mind folks, this is a retrospective, not aboxed set of the band's complete works...they can't include EVERYTHING or the price would be over the top...from the reviews I've read on this, I conclude that one mastering error would be nice to clean up with the next pressing of this collection, but the people complaining about the omission of &quot;Me Wise Magic&quot; and stuff like that...if they're a FAN, they already have that one on Best Of Volume One. Stop complaining and enjoy the music...as for me, I like the Hagar years...they seemed to be more of a team effort instead of a front man who seemed to be screaming &quot;Look at me&quot; and a strong backup band giving him way more than they needed to given his ego...not saying he wasn't good...it just seemed like Sammy was more interested in the team than his own interests. Yes, he left for awhile but you may recall, it was down to him wanting to release an all-new album after Balance and not a greatest-hits collection. All that said, I'm glad they settled their differences. Welcome back boys...long overdue and here's to the future!
B000268QB2|5.0|I read a review of this album in Rolling Stone magazine. It was a good review but not  fair enough. They compared the lead singer to Freddy Mercury. I'm a Queen fan and I'm of the opinion that Freddy's voice is unique. The fact that the reviwer mentioned Mercury was the push to buy this CD. It's absolutely pure delight pop-rock with no electric guitars. Tom Chaplin voice is quite original. Yes, it has some Mercury resemblance, the grandiosity ?not gratuitously may I add? of the songs, some of the choruses. But don't be misled by comparisons. Their muisc is fresh, original, full of pop/rock nostalgia for people of my generation, with a lot of influences from Queen, Todd Rundgren; some people mention Coldplay, Radiohead.  The songs have an urgency that almost hurt but in the right way. This album has been No. 1 in UK. I hope for a great success here in the USA. Strongly recommend it.
B000286S8S|2.0|Ok, let me make one thing clear: I do not own this CD. However, one thing that is obvious from the description is that about 80% of the tunes from this &quot;latest&quot; GH collection are the same as on the original GH collection. Now, if I'm expected to buy this CD for the sole purpose of getting three new (and mediocre) Haggar tunes, well, I'm sorry but the marketing wiz at Rhino Records is gonna have to come up with something a lot better than that. I would have rather waited a couple of more years to get a complete new studio album from Eddie and the boys. Hope you're proud - another cheap marketing ploy bites the dust!
B00005221M|5.0|While I will freely admit that this film is almost nothing like the book, I still love it. I'm afraid the book doesn't translate well to the modern reader, so most would feel as I did - that they want to throw the book out the window. What Michael Mann has given us instead is a grand, romantic adventure set during the French and Indian Wars. Two brothers, one white and one the son of the last Chief of the Mohicans, fight to save the women they love. Great cinematography, stunning soundtrack, can't say enough good things about it. Dialogue that would sound cheesy from anyone else rolls eloquently and believably out of Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe's mouths.
0790729628|5.0|Some may refer to Blade Runner as the best science fiction movie ever made.. I contend that it's one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />The support for this contention could go on for pages, but one of the main points is the extent of the vision that Ridley Scott and his colleagues had for this movie. To say that their vision was ahead of its time is truly an understatement.<br /><br />Let's not also forget the IMMENSE contribution that Vangelis gave this movie with his genius soundtrack. Without it, the power of the characters and their fantastic environments could have never existed.
B000002UUX|5.0|Great songs on here, great music all in all. &quot;Lucretia&quot; in my opinion is the standout here- while not nearly as heavy as &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; or &quot;Holy Wars&quot; it has a unique groove all its own that no other band in the world could imitate, with its beautiful riffs and wonderful solo at the end thanks to Marty Friedman (lead guitarist at the time) <br />  <br /> If you're a metal fan or new to Megadeth this is a must have in your collection! <br />  <br />
B00005NKK8|4.0|I really enjoy this soundtrack, it has a good selection of favorite songs from the 60s and 70s, but I concur with the previous reviewer who noted some great songs featured in the movie are missing. What happened?
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I don't like the vulgar on this CD.  And you call this music.  I sure don't.  What happen to the clean music.  There are children listening to this CD.  What kind of influence you have on kids.  This style of music is going to rot.  Every song has the f this and f that.  I think whoever wrote these songs need to grow up and start making better lyrics for everyone.  Don't have to use cuss words to make beautiful lyrics.  And Eminem what are you showing your little girl.  You aren't showing her nothing but cussing.  Well enough of this...I hope you have a great life or you need to get a life to listen to this garbage....
B00004YYDI|5.0|Leon is a simple, almost childlike man who sleeps sitting up in a chair, drinks a quart of milk at each meal, wears high-water pants under his overcoat, and has a houseplant as his only friend in a small appartment where he endures an unsociable existence. His life is enitrely unextraordinary, except for one thing - he is an assassin.  <br />  <br /> Mathilda is twelve going on thirty after years of being the most responsible person in a family of corrupt and compassionless individuals. When her one consolation, her baby brother, is killed along with the rest of the family during a botched drug deal, she flees to her neighbor's door, praying for mercy as she begs him to respond to her knocking. <br />  <br /> A middle-aged man and a 12-year-old girl? - I thought you said this was a love story, you're thinking. Don't become uncomfortable just yet. Though this is as much a suspense/drama as anything (with the ingenious Gary Oldman as another notoriously disgusting villain) it is the relationship that develops between the leads that is most remarkable. As Leon trains Mathilda to be an assassin and (in a contractdictory spin) teaches her some basic integrity as well, she shows him the value of &quot;living&quot; rather than simply existing. With brilliant performances by both Natalie Portman and French actor Jean Reno, the two meet on a plain of agelessness, creating a touching and purely platonic bond that may seem as though it pushes the limits, but in the end wins your respect and affection. <br />  <br /> &quot;Leon,&quot; the extended version of the American release &quot;The Professional&quot; is a fuller story, with only about twenty minutes more film, and is well worth the extra time. Even without the extra footage, it has been my favorite movie since I first saw it in 1992, but when the extended version was released, well, I don't think I could love any film more. <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Alright, I buy all types of music and listen to it. Got her last album it was good. I got this album, read the lyrics while listening to the songs. What can I say.

0783225199|4.0|&quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; has been criticised as being overlong, overstuffed and overhyped, but it's chock full of so much fun and so much great music that it's pure escapist nirvana. Our heroes (anti-heroes?) are Jake and Elwood Blues, inimitably played by Dan Aykroyd and the late John Belushi, on &quot;a mission from God&quot; to rescue the orphanage where they were raised from the wrecking ball. With one last whack of Sister's ruler sending them tumbling out into the street, they round up their old band piece by piece, and hit the road to raise funds. The Blues Brothers are consummate con artists, and 30 minutes into the film they have managed to fall afoul of the Chicago police force, the local neo-Nazi chapter, and a redneck singing group, not to mention Elwood's old girlfriend who's on a homicidal mission to blow him away. The mayhem starts early and escalates exponentially; there are enough car chases for three or four movies, including one inside a local mall which leaves it looking like the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, and it's nonstop action and laughs from the opening frames to the final credits.<br /><br /> But it's the music that really makes this movie. From James Brown playing a gospel preacher in a wild church service (there's a nice cameo by Chaka Khan in here) to Aretha Franklin playing the cantakerous owner of an inner-city diner, with appearances by John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, and the one and only Cab Calloway, the film is a showcase for some really great performances. The chase scenes are so over-the-top that they boggle the mind. The final chase, which must have wrecked half the cars in Chicago, has the entire Chicago police force (car, horse and boat), the U.S. Army, the local Nazis and a SWAT team after the Blues Brothers as they make a mad dash to the tax office to fulfill their &quot;mission&quot;.<br /><br /> The producers seemed to want to get anybody and his brother into the action, and almost succeeded; in addition to all the above, there are some minor appearances by Frank Oz, Twiggy (remember her?) Carrie Fisher, John Candy, and Steven Spielberg. But when all is said and done, the real &quot;star&quot; of this film is a beat-up black-and-white police car commandeered by Elwood Blues, with a bajillion violations on it, which seems to be able to do everything but fly (and when you see it turning somersaults in the air, you'll think maybe it can fly, too).<br /><br /> The film is overdone in spots, but taken as a whole, it's a two-and-a-half hour joyride. Grab the popcorn, kick back and have a ball.e some minor appearances by Frank Oz, Twiggy (remember her?) Carrie Fisher, John Candy, and Steven Spielberg.

B000286S8S|5.0|The guy who said to stop your whining is correct.  This is a great sampler with something special put in (the three new songs).  For those who complain about the Dave days being gone, the fact is is he was destroying the band with his ego.  Look at Diver Down, he was the one who wanted all the covers so they could have easy hits! I love all VH and it's great having Sammy back.  The band sounds better than ever so quit your crabbing.
B000002KHH|4.0|It's their first album, except shorter songs and far more commercial.  The first album was real jammy and the songs were mostly comprised of awesome but not radio friendly jam songs which I found to be awesome.  Then comes Paranoid, an album where jams only bookend this near commercial masterpiece. <br /> <br />1.War Pigs-Next to Black Sabbath, it's the epitomic Sabbath song.  Real jammy and in the vein of Sabbath's first album. <br />2.Paranoid-Sabbath's set closer for all time and quite possibly the best three minutes ever caught on tape. <br />3.Planet Caravan-Sabbath goes slightly acoustic.  They did this on all their albums even the first one at parts.  Good song but not the best. <br />4.Iron Man-Who hasn't heard this classic rifforama of a song.  Great all around song but after a million listens begins to bore you.  Still love it though. <br />5.Electric Funeral-Can I just say this song is better live.  Still a good song but is improved when played live. <br />6.Hand Of Doom-A misunderstood anti drug song with multiple time changes and a killer bass line. <br />7.Rat Salad-Great instrumental.  I don't even know why I like this.  Sure it could've been extended but then again bill ward was never an exciting drummer and prolly couldn't pull off an extended solo like bonham. <br />8.Fairies Wear Boots-Hilarious lyrics and all around great jammy song.   <br />Overall-This is essentially a great intro to any person for Sabbath.  It's arguably their best album(I argue that it's not) and is a great record for any rock enthusiast.  Personally, I think everyone should buy their entire catalog up until born again.  That's my two cents.  FAIRIES WEAR BOOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005U4UV|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST HORROR/ZOMBIE MOVIES OF ALL TIME, IT ACTUALLY HAD THE BALLS TO BE RELEASED UNRATED, WITH OTHER MOVIES SUCH AS RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD AND DAY OF THE DEAD COMING OUT AT THE SAME TIME IT HAD ALOT TO LIVE UP TO, BUT AS A FAN OF ALL OF THESE MOVIES RE- ANIMATOR WAS TOPS. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE TAKE SOME TIME TO DO SO, IT IS TRUELY ONE TO BE LOVED AND WILL WITHOUT A DOUBT LIVE ON FOR YEARS. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF PETER JACKSON'S DEAD ALIVE, YOU WILL LOVE RE-ANIMATOR. TRUST ME.
B000002KB8|5.0|Sabbath's first record is no dought it's best.  It really shows where the band was at this point and is essentially a live album because it was mostly recorded live and in one take.  The band is in full form on this record and lays the blueprint for heavy metal with this masterpiece. <br /> <br />1.Black Sabbath-What hasn't been said about this song.  It's the original heavy metal song and really sets the mood for Sabbath's career of music about the darker side of life.  All around great track with an excellent tempo change about four minutes in. <br />2.The Wizard-An underrated jem.  This song never got the credit it deserved and is probably the closest Sabbath ever came to sounding like Zeppelin.  Great harmonica work by the Ozzman. <br />3.Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B.-A really cool groovy jam track that is essentially two songs with a amazing bass solo connecting the two.  I must say that inspite of it being Geezer's only recorded bass solo, it's damn good.  NIB is the more popular of the two tracks and has a riff that everyone has heard at some point in their life.  Wasp/Behind The Wall Of Sleep is a good hard rocking song and sadly not much more.  Good song but not great. <br />4.Wicked World-Jazz Metal.  Never thought you'd hear that eh.  Great jazzy drum work by Bill and excellent riffs from Tony and Geezer with an exemplary solo by Tony in the middle. <br />5.A Bit Of Finger/Sleeping Village/The Warning-Essentially 15 minutes of the band playing and Ozzy singing from time to time with a whole lotta soloing by Tony.  I must say that this is Tony's real shining moment of Sabbath's career and is some of the best work he ever did. <br />6.Evil Woman-Only on European release and remastered version of this album-A song recorded as a single that Sabbath never wanted to do but was forced to do by management.  Originally done by a band from minnesota called crow, this song really doesn't fit in on this album. <br /> <br />Overall-The fantastic beginning of heavy metal and, in my opinion, Sabbath's best work ever.  Everyone should go out and buy this excellent record from nearly 35 years ago.  That's my two cents.

B000005HLV|5.0|Mayhem were one of the first black metal bands I ever heard and I was immediately hooked. Great necro guitar riffs by Euronymous, blast beat drumming by the mighty Hellhammer, Varg Vikernes on bass and the very odd vocals of Attila. He's the weakest link on this record, but he's not as awful as some say. In fact some of his vocals are very effective such as on Pagan Fears, at other times he is truly wretched. What the hell was he doing with those pseudo operatic vocals on the title track \\"De Mysteriis Dom Satanas\\"?!?! other than screwing it up I mean. Its no wonder that when Hellhammer reformed Mayhem after Euronymous' death and Vargs' incarceration that Attila was not asked to join.<br /> Atilla notwithstanding, this album is quintesential underground black metal, its dark, heavy, primitive and grim. An evil classic by the band that founded the Norwegian Black Metal scene.
0618526412|4.0|This is the first McCullers' book that I have read.  It felt like a timeless story that could have been written only yesterday instead of in the 1930's. It also could have been written by a much older, experienced person instead of a young girl of 23 years.  It is a gentle, sad story that might have been typical of small town life. It was very refreshing to feel submerged in the slow pace and emotion of life in a long gone era. The story touched me in an unexpected way, and I know I will long remember the characters and their individual stories. Timing is everything when making the choice to read this wonderful book.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Any fan of metal should own this groundbreaking record. Its still one of the most agressive metal recordings on the planet and it was released in 1986. Thats along time ago and it's still the champ. The drumming by Dave Lombardo is impecable, Tom Arayas' singing, screaming is in your face aggressive, just f*cking mean and the twin lead/rhythm guitars by Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman have to be heard to be believed, especially on the first tune \\"Angel of Death\\". They are two of the best guitarists in any genre today, period. This is one of those special albums that define a genre and by which other bands works are measured. There may be heavier bands out there now, but nobody has topped the pure adrenaline rush that is Reign In Blood.
B00005JLEX|5.0|What I can't believe is that they didn't put Seinfeld on dvd already.  I watch the show 2 or 3 times everyday on tv and I hardly ever see the same episode twice.  There are just countless episodes and none of them don't have you laughing hysterically.  It's a no-brainer putting Seinfeld on dvd, so whoever put the dvd together better put it in stores asap.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I watched this movie after having heard a very great deal about it: that it was the best movie ever, that it was incredibly over-rated, that it was good only for the innovations in direction and cinematography, that it was plotless and boring, and (of course) that Rosebud was Kane's sled. My conclusion? This film is amazing. Honestly, I know very little about the movie making- I'm not in film class, I have never directed anything, and I don't even particularly enjoy behind-the-scenes documentaries; my qualifications lie far more in literature. As a result, I was interested more in the plot and characterizations in this film than I was in the manner in which it was filmed. It was my feeling that not only was this movie breathtaking in it's portrait of Kane, one of the most fascinating characters I have come across in movies or books, but the narrative structure was entrancing without being gimmicky- it jumped through time with as little pause as a Tarantino movie, gradually revealing backstory a la Memento without the inherent inhumanity of a movie about a person to whom virtually no audience member can relate. All in all, I thought this movie far from inaccessible, and I think that one can justifiably call it the best American movie ever made.
B000255LIY|5.0|This version of the play \\"Lion in Winter\\" is actually a little better video than the 1968 movie.    I own the play book, the O'Toole/Hepburn 1968 movie, and this Stewart/Close 2003 video. I expected this to be an \\"almost as good\\" and was shocked and supprised that I like it better.    Actress Glen Close especially faced a challenging job of living up to Hepburn's epochical performance, and achieves it. The improvement to the play from her performance is similar to all the other actors' in this video: their characters are shown as slightly vulerable and hence more believable.    This 2003 'Halmark' production is a little better in that the psychology of the characters is a little more subtle and better brought out. O'Toole/Hepburn/Hopkins focused a little more on the verbal knives and daggers, less on the wounds. The acting by Close/Stewart/Howard and the rest of this cast leans more towards the hurt felt by the characters from eachother's barbs, something that's a needed emphasis to make the interactions such a long practiced dysfunctional family believable - I expected that the characters would have all hardened solid, years ago.    The only performance that I found somewhat difficult to adjust to was Andrew Howard's portrayal of Richard, compared to Anthony Hopkins'. Howard shows a much more convincingly human Richard, but not as kingly \\"lion hearted\\" as Hopkins'. In 1968, perhaps because he was worried about portraying a sympathetic gay character, Hopkins played a Richard who is the obvious choice for the next king. But that made Hopkin's presentation of Richard's moments of humanity in the play - when he is overcome by his love for his mother, or his ex-lover, Phillip - are less believable than Richard as played by Howard. Howard's tortured Richard is clearly soft under his armor, and the vulnerable scenes seem natural. But I perversely missed the comic-book \\"Good King Richard\\" on the screen while watching Howard play Richard as fully human.    I haven't seen anyone play Geoffrey in a way that satisfies me yet, but I think that could be a flaw in James Goldman's writing of the character.    Rafe Spall's body is a superior casting choice in this movie. I hope Spall will forgive me, but he looks the part of the slob; all the better to portray \\"Bad King John,\\" which rightly reduces the intensity of his lines. Unfortunately the director over-did the visual metaphors with the pigs in the end-of-video barnyard scene. It was a waste of screen time and an insult to Spall's already excellent portrayal of the spoiled youngest child.    There are other small visual clues that show moments of tenderness or affection between characters in this video, such as a fond glance between Philip and his half-sister Alais, that greatly help the story, which is otherwise so overloaded with family battles that the audience can forget that there is such a thing as a healthy, loving relationship. Another improvement is the rhythmic appearance of Eleanor's bodyguard; the actor portrayed vigilant loyalty so well, and without a single line, that he deserves to be listed in the credits. His performance serves again to show that good relationships are possible - where would Eleanor be without someone she could rely on to kill people in her way and then hide the body?
1400034779|4.0|I love these books but I must agree that it did take a bit of time to &quot;get into&quot; the first book. It's not really a mystery book as a story about a strong woman using her basic instincts and &quot;smarts&quot; to improve her life. Now I can't put down the books and the character is a real role model for following your own bliss and doing what you really enjoy in life, regardless of your education or background.<br /><br /> BTW -- Mma is pronounced &quot;mah&quot;, and rra is similarly pronounced &quot;rar&quot;. Mma means &quot;madame&quot;; Rra means &quot;sir&quot;. There are many good websites online that give more history on Botswana and language.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|As stated, I don't own this 3-in-1 CD set because I bought each of the CDs separately.  I would leave the theater at the end of each movie and head to the nearest music store to find the soundtrack, and I don't regret doing so.  These are among the best CDs I've ever purchased.  The music defies description; Howard Shore is a genius!!  Most of the selections are instrumental, but the vocal selections (Enya - CD 1; Emiliana Torrini - CD 2; Annie Lennox - CD 3) are magnificent.  I listen to these CDs every day.  I even burned a CD of the more soothing selections to listen to as I'm falling asleep.  Some selections are intense, but when I listen to them I can visualize scenes from the movies.  For those who love the Lord of the Rings movies or just like good music, these CDs are the best way to round out your collection.
B0001I55OC|2.0|I thought the concept behind this film was interesting so I watched it, only to be sadly dissapointed by the lack of effort behind a good idea. <br /> <br />I believe 14th century France would be mortified at how it was portrayed in this film with just a bunch of cardboard boxes thrown together as scenery and badly sewn together costumes. Even the attempt at speaking French seemed somehow out of a French 101 class in high school! The battle scenes are puppetry at best and nothing close to what a good Shakespearean play would have slapped together. The script itself is just far too predictable for my taste. <br /> <br />I hoped for more because like I said the idea behind this film is interesting. But next time I think I will spend my money on the book rather than a movie that has sadly run out of time.
B00003W8NM|1.0|This movie was a stylish version of a baby throwing a hissy fit, and suffers from pulp fiction syndrome( which is having no story and wasting a would be good movie on whatever the director was thinkin that day).  Nothing made sense, it had no good fights( and a movie called fight club should have good fights), and it was loaded with smut.  O yeah it also had a twist at the end which was unessasarily stupid.  Overall its a 2 out of a 10.  What a waste of talent.
B000286S8S|4.0|&quot;Best Of Volume 1&quot; was such a travesty that almost anything is a step up from that. So we're on the plus side to begin with. If you only want to own 1 VH title (as I do) then this is it. Every album is represented and all the hits are here. Here's the scoop:<br /><br /> PROS:<br /><br /> The remastering is nothing short of magnificent! Crystal clear sound that really is excellent. Includes everything of import from the aforementioned Vol. 1 (except &quot;Humans Being&quot;) plus such gems as &quot;Dancing In The Street,&quot; &quot;Feels So Good,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Girls,&quot; and &quot;Love Walks In.&quot; The real bonus is the inclusion of forgotten masterpiece &quot;I'll Wait.&quot; All in all, it's a good compilation.<br /><br /> CONS:<br /><br /> No liner notes and only 1 dorky photo. What the &%$#? The new songs are nothing special and are painfully inadequate when placed among such classics. Three live versions of songs whose studio counterparts are included here is really unforgivable. This would've been a much better collection had they nixed the live and new songs and included six others, such as: &quot;Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do),&quot; &quot;Humans Being,&quot; &quot;Cabo Wabo,&quot; &quot;Ice Cream Man,&quot; &quot;Mean Street,&quot; and &quot;Where Have All The Good Times Gone.&quot;<br /><br /> As with &quot;Volume 1&quot; what we ended up with is better than what we had before.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I first heard this record back in the early 1970's when it was first released. It was among the best records I'd ever heard back then (when in my early 20's), and though it does have a touch of dated pop rock, many of its songs still hold up, and compare well with the best popular music ever. And it's the ballads that hold up best, tunes like ALL THINGS MUST PASS, ISNT IT A PITY, BEWARE OF DARKNESS. Give these a close listening and they all sound near perfect with lyrics to match. Surprisingly, the &quot;Quiet&quot; Beatle in this record produced probably the best solo by any ex-Beatle right here!So over 30 years have passed, and George has passed, but this album has some fine recordings for, I feel, anyone of any age!
B000002B2X|5.0|For a start, you other reviewers need to learn how to spell AND type (and not be so negative and critical, you sound like kurt). These are all great tunes. What's not to like? As usual the vocals/harmonies are superb. Having Chris Cornell, Mark Arm and Ann Wilson adding their trademark vocal stylings is an asset to this set, not a liability. And plenty of great riffs for us guitar junkies out here. I bought this years ago for 'Got Me Wrong', but when i heard the other 3 tunes, i knew i'd found a winner. I did not find the hidden track 'Love Song (take 1)' until much later. Due to the EP being so short on running time, the tracks were repeated on both sides and i would flip the tape over and run both sides every time i listened to it. When i first heard the hidden track my initial reaction was of course, &quot;what the hell is that&quot;? Some of the other reviews state &quot;the hidden song is horrible&quot;. It isn't even a song! It is a tongue-in-cheek statement about how a love affair can be at any one moment &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; and in the next moment cacaphony, a nightmare, and a train wreck all at once. Anyone who has ever been married knows all about this. It was added for the band's as well as the fans amusement. As for the other offerings, &quot;Brother&quot; is a classic acoustic/folky type ditty augmented by Jerry's bluesy solo. Jerry sings lead and Ann harmonizes. &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; is plain old great AIC from start to finish. It has a great hook, and the usual hummable sing-along type chorus found in so many of Alice's songs. Layne sings lead. &quot;Right Turn&quot; is a hypnotizing acoustic number with adolescent lyrics playing on the old idea that men spend 9 months trying to get out of the womb, and the entire rest of our lives trying to get back in. So true. The track is listed as being performed by 'Alice Mudgarden'. &quot;Am I Inside&quot; is a very dark, brooding, acoustic guitar/piano duet. Layne sings lead, Jerry harmonizes in the bridge, and Ann comes in for the choruses. All in all a great disc more resembling an old-fashioned 60's hippy/folk/rock album than anything else (and i would know). Get this!
0743201140|1.0|Every other book on personality that I am aware of has the assessment contained right within the book's pages. The author's of &quot;Now, Discover Your Strengths,&quot; however, have come up with a new bookselling scheme. To take the assessment one must use a unique keycode printed on the inside cover of the book's jacket to access a website. The code is good for only one assessment, meaning one book per person (unless you personally file a complaint, I understand)--and not even that, but one assessment per person. Whether &quot;Now, Discover Your Strengths&quot; adds to our body of personality assessment is certainly debatable. Whether it takes greed to a new level is certainly not. My opinion is that it is best to stick with a book not so marred--an &quot;open source&quot; book, we could say.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|While this may seem to be only the latest addition to the genre of ever-monotonous, unfailingly overrated conveyer belt line of bands whose names begin with &quot;The&quot; (glaring exception-- The Shins, a wonderful band), Franz Ferdinand is an exception. True, &quot;Franz&quot; and &quot;The&quot; are two different words, but they could have easily landed in that generic cesspool of critical hype. But I think they escape it with flying colors.  <br /> Speaking of flying colors, an otherwise articulate and usually credible underground/indie website (whose name cannot be printed here) recently (meaning today) posted a clearly indifferent review of the song &quot;Michael,&quot; the new single from the very album they otherwise loved. There is a lot of homoeroticism here, and they only seem to be comfortable with it when it is tongue-in-cheek. &quot;Michael&quot; holds the distinction of being the only song on the album which blatantly addresses this quality, with an insistence that makes us question whether or not it's all a joke. My question: why does it have to be? When you have a groove this infectious, with guitars that scream and circle each other like amphetamine gypsies and drums that are as stately as they are fericious, does &quot;stubble on my sticky lips&quot; really turn you off to the song that quickly? Or does it come just close enough to turning you on?  <br /> The album, I agree, can sound a little monotonous on the first few listens. But unlike Is This It, this album got better with each listen.  <br /> The reason I wrote a review at all is that I couldn't believe there was only one review of this so far. That means not enough people have heard it. I say drop your copies of Highly Evolved and Room on Fire off at the 2nd hand CD shop, or at least donate them to someone who owns an Evanescence album, and move on.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Word of mouth & personal expierience made me want to see this movie.And when I did,it left an indelible mark.Granted,Clerks will have you laughing from beginning to end(such phrases as Chewlies Gum,37,____mopper,Berzerker,shoe polish,& salsa shark bring to mind this film),but it's the look at Gen X 20-somethings in the 90's. The bad job, stagnation and indecisiveness of life at that age. <br /> Brian O'Halloran plays Dante Hicks,the convienience store jockey with all the whiny&quot;I HATE MY LIFE BUT DON&quot;T WANT TO CHANGE IT&quot; attitude heard among Gen-Xer's.But Randell Graves (Jeff Anderson ) the clerk at the ajacent video store and the ultimate slacker.He hates his job, but not his life.He disregards his responsibility to his job because he knows it's a dead end and just something to do in the meanwhile. <br /> After a day in the life of Dante where he's conned and complaining about working on his day off(as well as other bizarre circumstances)Randell sets Dante straight telling him that he overdramatise things to make his life seem more interesting than what it is. <br /> Kevin Smith is a genius.Even though his movies fall on the wayside sometimes(Mallrats,Dogma),his skewed vision has brought him a following.Legend has it that he sold his comic book collection to finance Clerks.It shows he sacrificed something he loved for something his fans will embrace & love for many moons to come <br />
0743216458|5.0|Mr Ambrose takes the stories of these men who accomplished so much for the freedom of Europe in WWII and lets you climb into the foxhole with them in Bastonge, jump from the sky into Holland and France, and grieve with them when a comrade is killed. It is a book that is hard to put down once it is picked up. It still is amazing to me how a country such as the US who, as a people,abhor war and don't ever want to go to war can produce men like these who went to hell and back for thier country and there buddies. Yes there were outstanding British, Canadien,Russian, and German soldiers that did the same thing, but the story of this one company of the American 101st Airborne Division is a tribute to the indominable spirt of the American soldier in World War II. I highly recommed this book to anyone who wants to read about real men who fought, bled, were wounded, and some died to rid the World of Nazi enslavement and greed.
0060934700|5.0|Neil Gaiman is quickly becoming one of the world's most recognized and revered authors, and with good reason. His stories are fantastical, but not to the point that they are merely escapist enteratinment. When one reads a work by Gaiman, they come back into the real world and look at it differently, through smoke tinted glasses if you will. <br /> Every story in here is good, but some are better than others. <br /> -&quot;Chivalry&quot; is, as Gaiman himself says, a very friendly story. It's very funny and much lighter than his other works. <br /> -&quot;Tastings&quot; is not so much fantasy as it is eroticism, but it's different than what you would expect. There is more to this story than sex. <br /> -&quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot; is a very disturbing take on the Snow White mythology. A very chilling read that makes you see the Disney film in new light. <br /> -&quot;Murder Mysteries&quot; is one the best short stories ever written. Not only is it intricately plotted, but it also has a resonating message that anyone could find inspiration in, and if not inspiration then despair. <br /> -&quot;The Price&quot; is my personal favorite along with &quot;Murder Mysteries&quot;. It takes a whole new spin on the good vs. evil motif, has a twist that will throw you for a loop, and really makes you appreciate things you might perceive as normal, and in some cases annoying. <br /> -&quot;The Wedding Present&quot;, the story Gaiman hides in the introduction, is chilling and thought provoking. My next favorite of the collection. <br /> This is a great book and should be on the shelf of everybody who loves a good read.
B000286S8S|5.0|Van Halen is not only back with its first concert tour in over six years but with a brand new 'best of' compilation entitled &quot;The Best Of Both Worlds&quot;. This double-disc set is nearly packed to its limits covering the band's two classic eras (1978-1985 with singer David Lee Roth and 1986-1996 with Sammy Hagar). In addition to the remastered tracks, the set includes three brand new songs with the return of Sammy Hagar. &quot;It's About Time&quot;, &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Learning To See&quot; capture a revitalized Van Halen full of fresh new ideas and a style that harkens back to its classic release &quot;5150&quot; (Hagar's first album with Van Halen).<br /> As for the previously released material, it is a more comprehensive overview of the band's hits than what appeared on the 1996 &quot;Best Of Volume 1&quot; compilation. Sure, many of the tracks that appeared on the previous compilation are duplicated here but in addition, there is the VH classics &quot;Hot For Teacher&quot;, &quot;Jamie's Cryin'&quot;, &quot;Top Of The World&quot;, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;Runaround&quot; (plus many others).<br /> Like every &quot;Best of&quot; collection that passes our way, there's always a downside. In the case of Van Halen's &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot;, there are a few. First, the three live tracks which close the compilation feel completely out of place with the rest of the tracks. Also, the live material (which is three Roth-era tunes sung by Hagar from the band's 1993 live release &quot;Live, Right Here, Right Now&quot;) is already presented elsewhere on the compilation in their superior studio versions. Secondly, the band's 1981 &quot;Fair Warning&quot; album is represented soley by the track &quot;Unchained&quot;. Adding the popular hits &quot;So This Is Love&quot; and &quot;Mean Street&quot; to the compilation (in place of the live material) would have made the track list even stronger. Thirdly, not only is there no material from &quot;Van Halen III&quot; (the band's ill-fated and only album with singer Gary Cherone), there is no mention of it anywhere in the liner notes or the discography. Like it or not, &quot;Van Halen III&quot; did happen and removing it from a career-spanning anthology isn't going to change it. If there was just one track to represent &quot;VHIII&quot; to include on this compilation, my personal choice would be &quot;Without You&quot;. Forth, there is an abrupt cut-out at the end of &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; which could have been due to a CD-mastering oversight.<br /> Apart from these minor drawbacks, &quot;The Best Of Both Worlds&quot; is a fine collection from this vetran band. It's great to have Eddie, Alex, Michael and Sammy back together again after being apart for so long. Here's hoping the guys will re-enter the studio to make an album of all-new material real soon. If the three new tracks on this CD are of any indication, I can hardly wait for a full album. Until then, this compilation as well as Van Halen's back catalog will do just fine for now.<br /> God Bless Van Halen. Welcome Back Boys!!!there no material from &quot;Van Halen III&quot; (the band's ill-fated and only album with singer Gary Cherone), there is no mention of it anywhere in the liner notes or the discography.

0312995423|1.0|Brown is attempting to do for computers and the NSA what Tom Clancy does for the military and their hardware. The difference is that Clancy appears to do his homework, whereas Brown manages to have errors on almost every page and appears to have put no effort at all into learning how either computers or encryption work. Anyone who has a reasonably technical background in computing will wince on reading this claptrap. This habit continues into his description of Spain, where much of the action is set (hey Dan, they're a modern European country,  not a banana republic!) and pretty much everything else that he touches.
B0002234LS|5.0|When you watch it the first time, you don't quite catch on, but the second time around is great because of what you now know.  i definitely recommend this movie.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I just bought the Starsky and Hutch DVD. One of the previews was for the Seinfeld DVD's. It basically said that all of the seasons will be released soon in their original network format. They will also contain deleted scenes, bloopers, commentary and some behind the scenes footage. No release date was given, it just said &quot;coming soon.&quot;
B00005JMUA|5.0|Loved part 2 because it provided a balance from the first installment.  Tarantino's work is pure genius. I thought, how can Tarantino top Kill Bill Vol. 1? But what he's done in Vol. 2 is flesh out the story. Vol. 1 has incredible fight sequences; Vol. 2 does some sweet character development and gives us the whole story. Uma Thurman really throws herself into the part. You'll be amazed at this conclusion to a masterpiece.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I saw a Biography segment on A&E Channel on Salma Hayek of whom I was vaguely aware. She was shopping  her biographical Frida Kahlo idea around Hollywood. Thank God she did not allow them overlay what I call the Hollywood Formula onto her idea. She finally got Julie Taymor (Lion King stage play) to direct it, and what direction it was! The colors! The moods, everything was so Mexican! Taymor?s experience with puppetry was put to dazzling use in the entire film. I was blown away by her dream-like, or (should I say) nightmare-like sequence of doctors and spines, revealing the poignancy of Frida?s physical pain and hospital stays. It was comic and horrific, harking back to Day-of-the-Dead comi-tragic imagery.<br /><br />Kayak?s courage in attempting some daring scenes and appropriate nudity caused me to admire this beautiful model. There is an erotic spirituality about this film. It is very woman-like, also with remnants of what among poets and fiction writers used to be called Magical Realism, peculiar to Latino writers of this century.<br /><br />I enjoyed Frida?s manly qualities and wondered if they really belonged to her or merely of Salma?s interpretation of her. When Frida dances with Ashley Judd, I felt the sexual tension coming from Salma but not from Judd. In an interview, Judd said that scene made her uncomfortable. That moment was lacking for me, possibly because I have seen real tango dancers in Argentina with the sensually arrogant machismo both the male and female dancers exude.<br />For the rest of this review. (...)
B00005JMEW|5.0|I?m reading these other reviews on Kill Bill and it seems the approval rating is about 50/50. I then think to myself how in the world can this be? Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest film makers of all time. I loved Pulp Fiction for example, it is one of the most influential movies of the 90s. Some speak of violence or gore in the film with the same lack of understanding or ignorance. Tarantino is trying to fuse Japanese Yakuza and Samurai movies, water it down till its palatable to a U.S. audience to present a masterpiece. Seems like all the great directors whom you all love have a great respect for Asian cultures, Lucas with his Jedi or should we say Samurai or Spielberg with Road to Perdition, its been done before with Lone Wolf and Cub. Tarantino?s ability to stylize his film with music and anime is a respectfully refreshing new concept in American cinema has gone un matched in originality. This movie is a must buy.
0515125024|4.0|The action literally starts on the first page of this book when the super-hero Jack Reacher is abducted with a woman who had just dropped her dry cleaning.  The woman is an FBI agent and, of course, something more.  Reacher and she are taken to the outpost of a militia intent on declaring its independence from the USA and doing other unmentionable (here) malicious things. <br /> <br />As usual, Reacher is up to the task - and more.  Using his inhuman ability to analyze every problem and shoot every gun known he once again prevails.  Like all the Reacher novels, this is action-packed with some good twists and turns in the plot.  The super bad guy was a bit over the top, but part of enjoying these books is suspending belief for a time. <br /> <br />A good, fun action-packed read for a period of escapism.  Great beach reading.
0385510438|2.0|This feels like Grisham's attempt to write Southern literature, rather than suspense fiction. The entire book feels like a feeble attempt to imitate Harper Lee. Don't let the book jacket fool you, a full 1/3 of the book cover stuff that isn't related to the trial at all. <br />  <br /> The editing is also poor. Once he used the same exact descriptive sentence in two different places in the novel. In another, he describes a young man wants to be a draft dodger but is convinced to go to Vietnam by his parents. Less than 10 pages later Grisham writes that the parents begged their son not to go. <br />  <br /> The entire plot is a let down. There is no suspense, the &quot;surprise ending&quot; meager and predictable, and Grisham wastes half the novel writing about utter non-sense that is not related to the story and is not charming.
B000002G7G|3.0|I have constantly wondered why everyone thinks the Velvet Underground is the best band ever. I have listened to all four albums and White Light/White Heat is the only one that actually felt like something innovative and fresh. Honestly, what did the Velvets do that prior bands had not already done, and better? The Rolling Stones? The Who? The Kinks? Not to mention the infinite numbers of 60s garage punk bands, especially the Sonics, and German experimenters Can's Monster Movie? I believe there are several reasons the Velvets were seen as cool: a.) they had a hip backer in Andy Warhol. b.) they were from New York City. c.) they couldn't play their instruments very well. and d.) loads of critics and bands thought they were cool, so everyone else jumped on the bandwagon. I respect them for their influence and like their punky rawness, and actually I don't completely dislike the band or their music. However, they are incredibly overrated and were incredibly pretensious. <br />  <br /> Their third album, The Velvet Underground, especially showcases several things about the band. Most importantly, John Cale, NOT Lou Reed, was the best part of the band. White Light/White Heat was edgy and different, and obvious precedent for punk and post-punk. John Cale's experimentation kept the album interesting. Without the wild experimentalism of White Light/White Heat, their songs were nothing more than garage punk filtered through monochrome pretension.  <br />  <br /> Also, Lou Reed wrote ballads that basically sounded like rawer, less interesting versions of The Rolling Stones' ballads. &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; would fit very well on this album. Not that its a bad thing, its just that VU stopped being groundbreaking and experimental. Furthermore, VU never achieved the sonic diversity of the Stones. There's nothing here matching even the raw coolness of &quot;Paint it Black&quot;. My point is that the formula had been done before. Its not groundbreaking, and its not even really that interesting. &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;Beginning to See The Light&quot; are the only things that hold my interest here, and those two songs sound almost exactly the same. <br />  <br /> My basic point is that this album and this band are really really overrated. Overrated is not the same thing as bad -- in fact I don't dislike them. I just would rather listen to The Sonics or Can's &quot;Monster Movie&quot; or even the Rolling Stones' early stuff over this any day.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Boy, I took it hard on this one. If you want to torture someone via Clockwork Orange style, this is your movie. This is the type of movie where all the ARTSY freaks come out to describe just how brilliant it is.  <br />  <br /> No, but what is really great is how these people on here try to use all these words that no one has ever even heard of to describe the flow, and direction and a bunch of other nonsense about this abortion of a film. This of course, is to make them feel as though they are &quot;getting&quot; it, when in fact, they make about as much sense as this movie did. <br />  <br /> How many of you have ever witnessed a &quot;case of the coaches kid&quot; getting the playing time over more talented kids. Now come on, lets not probe ourselves here, you all know damn well why this vomit was heraled with such praise.  <br />  <br /> Wait, I just figured it out. Here is my new plan. I am going to film myself, you know, walking down the street for 20 minutes, kicking a few rocks, looking sad and then coming home. Then I will film myself picking up a spoon or putting in ceiling fan while cutting to some scenes of a few mountains (you know, for the artsy liberals out there). The only thing I don't have is the relative in the business to ride off of.  <br />  <br /> Then I can sit back and listen to all these sundance, expression, look at me I'm talking in circles about nothing wannabees, critique a film that will waste every bit of two hours of their life as this one did.  <br />  <br /> If this is all it takes now, I'm in the wrong business.
B000001FZK|5.0|I bought The Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, Bowie's &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; within days of one another. This created difficulties as I had the best albums of the sixties, seventies and nineties, respectively, vying for time in my cd player. When all was said and done, this album was the one I play the most. At first I loved the music, but disliked Mark Hollis's voice. If that turns you off at first, keep listening -- soon his voice is just another instrument - it meshes so perfectly with the music that it is impossible to imagine any voice more fitting and heavenly. Being a longtime Radiohead and Sigur Ros fan, I can now see the profound influence this album has had on them. Indeed, here is the blueprints for post-rock (Tortoise, Sea and Cake, Radiohead, Sigur Ros), sadcore (Idaho, Low) and slowcore (Bedhead). Also, people should notice that it was co-released by Polydor and Verve, one of the most important jazz labels ever. The album runs effortlessly through pop, ambient music, avant-garde, jazz, blues, and classical music. My favorite tracks are &quot;After the Flood&quot; and &quot;New Grass&quot;, but the whole cd is utterly mindblowing. This album is kind of unfair to the rest of the bands that followed because it is virtually impossible to match. Even Radiohead's (or any other band that followed in its wake, for that matter) best moments can't even scrape the surface of &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;. This one of those albums that one could fall into an obsessive lifelong relationship with and die quietly while listening to. I sure hope this is what is listened to in the afterlife, along with Can's &quot;Future Days&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. It's really a damn shame this timeless, perfect album is forgotten by most people. Honestly, it was easily the best $5.99 I've ever spent. Get it and you'll never be the same.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|I like Alicia Keys' music. Some feel that she is overrated. I personally think it may be too early in her career to comment specifically on that, but I do feel that she hasn't fully reached the apex of her creativity. Alicia has more talent and spirit than some of her diva counterparts. We've seen it time and again, but I think there will be much more in the future. <br />  <br /> Having said that, this set will do as good exposure to Alicia's talent. &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; has to be the most perfect usage of sampling yet for 2004, and is alone worth the price of the CD. The vibe and atmosphere match the lyrics to a tee, and I disagree that the spoken interlude is either corny or too long. This one is a modern day masterpiece...well done, Alicia! <br />  <br /> There are other flashes of brilliance throughout the album that let you know that Alicia is a force to be reckoned with. But you always get the feeling that there is too much left in reserve. You always wanna leave your fans wanting more, but maybe not quite this much. <br />  <br /> An example of what I'm talking about is the album's closer, &quot;Nobody Not Really.&quot; This is the kind of off-the-beaten-path material that I know Alicia is capable of, and so much more...and it so GOOD. But this is one brilliant song compared to what is mostly average R&B material.  <br />  <br /> I realize that Ms. Keys is more of a mainstream artist on a mainstream label, so she can't get too far out there. But perhaps next time around we can get a better balanced mix of the predictable stuff and the songs that express her own vision. What she sees is beautiful and I'd like to experience more of it. <br />  <br />

B000002TQB|4.0|(4.5 Stars)    \\"Parklife\\" is commonly thought of as Blur's masterpiece; a widly diverse album bursting with hooks.      \\"Girls & Boys\\" is an insanely catchy (borderline annoying) mix of disco, new wave, and pop to kick off the album. It only gets better.    There's sweeping ballads (\\"End of a Century\\"), brit-pop anthems (\\"Parklife\\"), thrashy punk (\\"Bank Holiday\\"), carnival waltzes (\\"The Debt Collector\\"), spacey psychedelia (\\"Far Out\\"), chamber pop (\\"To The End\\"), futuristic new wave (\\"Trouble In the Message Centre\\"), and of course, catchy pop (\\"London Loves\\", \\"Magic America).     The album closes with \\"This is a Low\\", a soaring melancholy ballad that's arguably Blur's finest moment.    Other highlights include the subtly symphonic pop of \\"Tracy Jacks\\", the high energy \\"Jubilee\\", the harpsichord ballad \\"Clover Over Dover\\", and the lush, bittersweet \\"Badhead\\" (Blur's most underrated song).     \\"Parklife\\" is catchy, clever, fun. Everything that a pop album should be, but rarely is. Don't pass it up.    Best Songs: Badhead, This is a Low, Parklife, Trouble in the Message Centre, To The End, London Loves.

B00005LMBK|5.0|Considering all the famous names involved in the Gorillaz project, one cannot but call it a true supergroup. Now, the usual problem of supergroups is that they often turn out to be just a self-indulgent showcase for their participants' instrumental talents, while the songwriting and the flow is forsaken. Fortunately, Gorillaz are in the minority here, and the talents of the band-members unite to create some unique synergy and an impressively varied album. <br />  <br /> As with many truly creative works, Gorillaz' debut denies classification. It's rooted in hip-hop, but there's plenty of rock, punk, trip-hop, drum-n-bass and other influences. It's a mellow flowing music with vocals ranging from rapping to clean singing, to punkish harshness. And there's a lot of soundscape-building going on in the background. Highlights include a trip-hop &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, a rapping hit single &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, and an original blend &quot;Latino Simone&quot;. But other tracks aren't disappointing either, and another listener's personal preferences might vary from mine, depending on his music of choice. <br />  <br /> This is not an album for anyone, but I think it's an important part of 90s music. At least one listen is almost mandatory.

B00006LPER|4.0|&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; is the story of Erika Kohut (a once in a lifetime role, perfectly played by French actress, Isabelle Huppert) is a renowned piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory, a top-notch prestigious music school in Vienna.<br /><br /> Erika, in her early forties and still painfully single, lives and even sleeps in the same bed with her vicious, overprotective and sadistic controlling mother (played aptly by Annie Girardot, however the part was initially offered to the fabulous Jeanne Moreau).<br /><br /> Erika is a complex human being to say the least. Besides the fact that she is playing host to a many colored different lifestyle by acting as the &quot;man of the house&quot;, Erika is utterly and deeply sexually repressed. When things in Erika's tiny, cloistered life get too horribly awful for her own self-expression and outpouring of feelings, she resorts to sexual self-mutilation, voyeurism, porn shops, and her own underworld of unspeakable acts on other human beings besides herself.<br /><br /> Then... Erika meets Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a engineering student-cum-talented pianist who signs on to Erika's &quot;Master Class&quot; that she teaches at conservatory. Walter is struck by the singularly quiet but strong, Erika and he lets his feelings be known. However, Erika &quot;expresses&quot; herself in very &quot;different&quot; ways such as sexual sado-masochism and writes to Walter all the things that she longs for him to &quot;do&quot; to her, all the while, Erika treats Walter like less than a human as she does, most all the people and her own students in her sick, sad and twisted life.<br /><br /> The irony of this story is that Erika can only truly express herself and her scant good, beautiful and natural feelings &quot;a priori&quot;- in and through her music, but in really no other way. Her sick and twisted thoughts of man overpowering woman, rape, a sexual relationship with her own mother, self-mutilation, and general sadistic behavior overtake her and in the end... Well, watch and find out for yourself.<br /><br /> Really, over and above it all, Erika's jealousy of other human beings who can and DO express their longings, fears, joys, and disappointments get to her in the end. When Erika is finally able to express her feelings and what it is she THINKS that she wants and desires in her sad half-human, base sort of way, she is rejected and thus the end to the tale is quite a sad one...<br /><br /> This is probably the most sexually charged movie that I have viewed without any of the cast being the least bit naked. There is no quivering frontal flesh in this fabulous film, only frightful, frigid, fruitless feelings that will cut you to the bone...<br /><br /> Careful Viewing Is Required...e end...

B0000797IO|5.0|You know, reviewer readers, every town from Salem, Massachusetts to Salem, Oregon has a local store just like the great state of Texas' Retail Rodeo featured in this film. Go ahead and call 'em Odd Lots, Big Lots, Dollar General, Family Dollar, or the old fashioned phrase of Five & Dimes, but every town has one and usually they employ some strange people to boot Let me tell ya, there are LOADS of strange characters in &quot;The Good Girl&quot;.<br /><br /> Justine &quot;Teeny&quot; Last, played surprisingly & extraordinarily well by none other than Mrs. Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston is a clerk/cashier/cosmetics counter employee at the local Retail Rodeo. Who knew that Jennifer could really act? Not me! For her to break out of the Rachael mold was exciting to watch for I was quite pleased with her performance even though I am not a huge fan of &quot;Friends&quot;.<br /><br /> The unhappy, trapped in her loveless & babyless marriage, Justine meets the morose Tom Worther, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, the &quot;brandy new&quot; cashier at Retail Rodeo and well... they start up an affair. Tom is his &quot;slave name&quot; as he tells Justine, so he has re-named himself after &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot;. Justine asks, so your name is &quot;Catcher&quot;? He states, &quot;NO, Holden, from Holden Caulfield, the main character in the book.&quot;<br /><br /> Teeny and Holden start meetin' for their lovin' in the back store room of Retail Rodeo, the town's seedy motels, and even Teeny's car, they form a bond and above all else, seem to really understand one another like no one has understood either one of them before in their whole existence. They sweetly refer to it in the film as &quot;Gettin' Got&quot;...<br /><br /> Even Justine's pothead housepainter of a husband, Phil Last, played deftly by John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights) never has really &quot;got&quot; Justine.<br /><br /> Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson) , Phil's best friend, co-painter & pot smoker in crime and his dog Bits find out about Holden and Justine and then things sure do git interestin'!<br /><br /> Zooey Deschanel from &quot;Almost Famous&quot; has a hilarious part as Cheryl, a smart aleck and edgy store employee, Mike White as the gospel preachin' Nazarene security guard, &quot;Corney&quot;, Deborah Rush as Gwen, and your Retail Rodeo Store Manager, Jack Field is played convincingly by John Carroll Lynch.<br /><br /> This is one of the best drama/comedies that I have viewed in quite a while, so come on down to your local Retail Rodeo and &quot;Get Got!!!&quot;<br /><br /> Happy Watching, All!!!things sure do git interestin'!

B000286S8S|3.0|First, here's what is good about this 2-disc set:<br /><br /> ---- 3 new songs, like 'em or not. I think &quot;It's About Time&quot; is pretty decent. Its song structure is similar to what was good about the Van Hagar era. Interesting chord changes, etc. &quot;Up For Breakfast&quot; is a bit silly lyrically. &quot;...she puts cream in my coffee...&quot; yeah, yeah, yeah Sammy. We know you have always been a bit challenged lyrically. So many songs about s-e-x that sound silly coming from a guy old enough to have an AARP card. And &quot;Learning to See&quot; - okay song but not a home run. Still, just getting some new stuff is okay, though 2 of them sound like they could have come from &quot;Balance.&quot; Not much songwriting growth, Ed, from someone who claims to have written hundreds and hundreds of songs while the band was on, er, &quot;hiatus&quot;.<br /><br /> ---- Remastered tracks: The DLR-era discs have already been remastered and released (Fall of 2000), so it is nice to get the Hagar tunes done up the same way. Eddie even admitted in the mid 1990's that he was very unhappy with the mix of OU812 (&quot;sonically it was [poop]&quot;, he said).<br /><br /> Now here's what is NOT so good about this collection:<br /><br /> --- Someone goofed and cut off &quot;Finish What Ya Started&quot; before the fade-out. It cuts off at an awkward moment. Someone didn't finish what they started, apparently. At first I thought my disc pressing was defective, but nearly every reviewer in this forum has made the same discovery, so I don't feel singled out anymore.<br /><br /> --- Only one track from &quot;Fair Warning&quot;? What's up with that? They could have easily bounced some of the Hagar ballads in favor of &quot;Mean Streets&quot;, &quot;So This Is Love?&quot;, or even &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;. Oh, those Hagar ballads..... &quot;I Can't Stop Loving You&quot; ---ugh! While I wasn't jumping for joy when Sammy left VH back in the 90's, I was a bit relieved because it was obvious that VH was turning into a Pop band instead of staying a Rock band.<br /><br /> ----- No tracks from &quot;III&quot;. Granted, the boys seem to have disowned that project. Too bad, because despite its grandiose flaws there were some killer tracks on it, namely &quot;Fire In The Hole&quot; and &quot;Dirty Water Dog&quot;. They complained about poor sales of that record, but I'd bet that few fans who never bought it actually heard anything other than the lead single &quot;Without You&quot;, which was pretty decent. There are many tracks on &quot;III&quot; I never care to hear again (&quot;How Many Say I&quot;), but I'm glad I have the album because the songs that work REALLY work!<br /><br /> ---- Sequencing of songs: moan and whine, moan and whine.... it just seems so darn disjointed. There is no sonic flow to it at all. I'm not saying all the songs should have been sequenced in chronological order (which would have made omissions and favoritism READILY apparent), but some sense of flow would have been nice.<br /><br /> ---- Another reviewer mentioned liner notes and a discography... Not in my version! Were there multiple release versions? Wait! Oops! Found it. Found it tucked away in the center section. I swear, if I hadn't read about it elsewhere I NEVER would have found it or thought to look for it. Quit hiding the darn things! Maybe the lyrics for the new songs are in there. [looking....looking] Nope. No luck.<br /><br /> **A final note -- since Day One of the Van Halen records, songwriting credit has been split evenly between all 4 band members. Consequently, they share songwriting royalties equally. Even &quot;Eruption&quot;, obviously an Eddie-only effort, is credited to Mike, Alex, Dave, and Eddie.<br /><br /> So what's my point? These three new songs in this compilation, according to the liner notes, are credited to Sammy, Alex, and Eddie. No Michael Anthony. Misprint perhaps? Or was this a jab at Mike somehow? Mike made no secret of staying close withSammy during the years Sam was no longer in Van Halen. He even referred to the Van Halen brothers as &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot; on one of Sammy's concert DVDs a while back. Was Mikey in a bit of hot water with them for a while because of that? Even if Mikey didn't directly contribute to the 3 new songs, he most assuredly didn't contribute to &quot;Eruption&quot; or &quot;316&quot; either, yet he shares credit on those songs. Hmmmmmm.<br /><br /> Also, check out the band photo in the liner notes booklet. Sammy is featured MUCH more prominently than the other 3 guys. And with a cat-that-ate-the-canary grin, to boot. This is just speculation on my part, but how much you wanna bet that what was running through Sammy's mind at the moment that pic was taken was &quot;See, they came crawling back to me after all!&quot;? If Sammy's selfishness and ego was to blame for their initial split (as Eddie has claimed from time to time), I'll bet you a shiny new nickel that it will lead to them breaking up AGAIN sooner than later.<br /><br /> It just seems a bit in bad taste to make Sammy the obvious focus of that photo. In that photo they don't look like a band of friends/brothers. It looks like Sammy Hagar and his Band of Genuflecting Butt-Kissers Who Are Just Happy To Be Performing With a Singer Again.<br /><br /> I hope that wasn't/isn't the case, but one could rightly assume it so.n referred to the Van Halen brothers as &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot; on one of Sammy's concert DVDs a while back.

B00008A7QK|5.0|I take offense at Krimboys review of Electric warrior.  First of all, when it comes to rock music you can't seperate the lyrics from the music and judge them in that way.  You have to take it as a whole. And the whole here is that of original genius.  Everything about Bolan, his lyrics, his vocal delivery, The sound of his voice, his guitar playing and even his appearance was perfect to this sound.  Thats right, his style is impossible to reproduce and that is one of the signs of genius. Most small minded folk listen to BOlans lyrics and imagine him as some sort of simpleton. I beleive BOlan had a great feel for life and that he is the equal of anyone in rock including Dylan, Neil Young, The Beatles or whomever.  To call hin a Glam rocker is also to limit his power.  Glam rock is a part of what he was about but he was also so much more.  He was a real Rock Star and he was a Musical Wizard.  I can't beleive he's not yet in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.  I love the fact that his stature continues to grow.  To say that Marc Bolan was no Rocket Scientist is not relevant.  Of all the Rocket Scientists I'll bet none of them could contribute something to the world as cool Electric Warrior.
B00005JMYG|1.0|This movie was first, rated PG-13, but in my opinion, should have been rated R. I am not a prude, but in the context of this movie, the blue language and references were not necessary. The dialog was as stilted as I have heard in any &quot;B&quot; movie. I may have laughed a few times at the beginning, but after that it became boring and childish. I felt that Dumb and Dumber was funnier than this one. I did enjoy Will Farrell in Elves, but this just was not at all to my liking.
B000286S8S|4.0|A fairly decent retrospective of a band that have come to turmoil with two different but astounding lead singers. It's good enough for Eddie to release something that is truly worthwhile for fans everywhere besides the ups and downs. I would be pretentious if I didn't like the band at all. It's nice hearing that distinctive guitar sound blaring out from the speakers again. Once again, the cradle will rock...

0783229364|5.0|While many dismiss Secret of My Success as a fluffy, unrealistic light comedy film, the fact is that Fox's character was a lot more substantive than some of the Bozos I have seen vault up the corporate ladder. Most of them nice-looking, all of them weilding a functional line of bull, they have somehow landed in corporations and performed no work at all -- aside from relentless self-promotion. <br />  <br /> At least MJF collected and studied some reference materials in his office. The real-life airheads I've seen did nothing of the sort. Their sole activity was to shadow the suits, provide conversation (read &quot;agreement&quot;), and act as nothing more than a sycophantic fawning toady lickspittle apple-polishing yes-man lapdog. And, they always got promoted, right up the ladder. <br />  <br /> MJF's character indeed had some of that in him, plugging really early into a network anchored by the president's wife, and we did see the young man doing a lot of good-old glad-handing. But you can't summarily dismiss Secret of My Success as a fluff-piece. There's no telling how many skippy-dog little pretty-boys have employed the film as a personal business model, and have actually reaped real-life corporate success therefrom.

B000002BBY|3.0|No, Oasis wasn't the greatest band in the world. They weren't better than the Beatles. They didn't have the talent to match their egos, but I don't even think the Beatles had the talent to match Oasis' egos. All in all they put together a good album with &quot;What's the Story, Morning Glory?&quot; There was some crap, but three really good songs and four pretty good ones out of ten isn't bad. They never deserved all the hype and I think some people still hold it against them. I say blame the press for annointing these guys &quot;The next Beatles&quot; or whatever. The album's enjoyable, and I recommend it to anyone like me who thinks rock music peaked in '73.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|I cannot go into how many ways this films bothers me or I would be playing spoiler.  Oh, how I wished I had read the spoilers first!<br />It was tightly directed, though with a style and feel that echoed a much better film, A Perfect World.  But unlike A Perfect World, where the were good guys, bad buys and bad guys who had good in them, this film has no one that is likeable, no one you can respect.  Worse, it has no remorse, and that is SO sad, no redemption.<br />Bacon, Penn, and Robinson put in strong performances in their going nowhere roles.  I admired Eastwood's flair in A Perfect World, an emotional film that touched you on all levels.  Only this movie...well, you want to wash after watching it.  You cannot empathize with Penn's character, even though the murder of his 19-year-old daughter is the focal point of the film.  Sorry, to point all the problems of this film one would have to go into spoilers left and right (I wish someone had told me the spoilers before!).  There are devises that have no place in the film, that do nothing to further the storyline, just Eastwood's sense of quirky?  Quirky worked in A Perfect World, quirky worked in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Quirky in this films was an insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  I have loved Eastwood since his Rowdy Yates days, and marveled all the films he has starred in or directed ever since.  But this one just is so pointless.  This movie has a lack of honor, of true caring, of heart and it just hurts to see such talent put to such a useless waste of 2 ½ hours.<br />My best advice - Rent this film before you buy or - be sure to read all the BAD reviews before making up your mind.  Most people will not enjoy the senseless violence and to no end.  Most people will not like the total remorse in nearly all the characters.
0812550706|5.0|We read books about unappreciated geniuses all the time. How often do we read books about geniuses that are appreciated? Not only appreciated by lauded? And not only lauded but miserable beyond belief? When author Orson Scott Card first wrote a full length book out of his short story &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, he could never have predicted the impact it would make. Since its conception, gifted children have read it on a personal level. Members of the military have viewed it as their epic. It has been taught in schools as an example of leadership, about its use of problem solving, about the role of self-creation, as a political book, and even as religious fiction. The book is infinitely adaptable and easy to relate to. Few would contest that it is Card's best written work today.<br /><br /> Our hero is Ender Wiggin, a boy who starts this tale at the tender age of six. The third child in his family (ala the book &quot;Among the Hidden&quot; third children are illegal in the world) his birth was approved of by the military. Ender is a genius, more intelligent than either his psychopathic elder brother Peter or his calm loving sister Valentine. When it becomes clear that Ender is capable defending himself in violent confrontations, the military recruits him. It seems the world was once nearly destroyed by creatures now referred to as &quot;buggers&quot;. Though the Earth was saved, barely, in the last invasion, they're looking for a military genius to beat the buggers a second time. That's where Ender comes in. He is seen as the world's last hope. If he can rise to be the commander that leads Earth's ships to military success against the bugger scourge he will have saved humanity itself. That is, if he can survive the military itself.<br /><br /> A great writer (it may have been Anne Lamott) once said that a good writer should never be afraid to put his/her characters into painful situations. Well, I can clearly state here and now that Card is in no way afraid to put Ender through the paces. This kid suffers often and regularly and if you're not comfortable reading about a miserable little child then you may as well put this book down right now. There's a real bent of cruelty to this story, some of it violent for the sake of violence and some of it done with the intention of making Ender stronger. Card's at work on this story in a variety of interesting ways. Not only does he make you think of the role of war for humanity (I found myself wondering if humans fight with one another just to keep their brains amused) but also the nature of propaganda, the toll of genius, the price of significantly affecting a child physically and emotionally even if that child is brilliant, etc. You can come at this book from a million different angles and interpretation and, even if you dislike it, you can't stop talking about it.<br /><br /> Now the book does suffer here and there from what I like to call sci-fi sexism. The explanation about why genius girls aren't entered into the school much says, &quot;They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution are working against them&quot;. Better still, the one girl that Ender does meet at the school is the first to freak out when, towards the end, he uses her in a complicated bugger game. So there you have it. A woman's instincts to stay at home and raise children make her evolutionarily less likely to want to hunt and gather and fight like her male counterparts. Due to the fact that this book was published in 1977 originally as a short story I might have forgiven this flub. The fact that Card kept it for the 1991 revision... less forgivable.<br /><br /> Now, if you're going to purchase a particular edition of &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, I'd like to personally recommend the Author's Definitive Edition. Not only has Card written a delightful and though provoking introduction to his tale but he has also gone back and fixed, &quot;the errors and internal contradictions and stylisticexcesses&quot; that have bugged him for years. The introduction puts the book into perspective, recalling not only the process by which Card as an author came to his story, but also the responses he's received to it over the years. For anyone who enjoys the book, this introduction is necessary for a really thorough reading. Also, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to kids. Teens yes, kids no.<br /><br /> Though not without its flaws, it's unlikely that you'll ever find a science fiction book that has touched so many people in so many different and various ways. It is an excellent view of games and (in some ways) the role of videos games on children. Or maybe it's a book about childhood itself. I can't begin to try to pick apart the different things the author is trying to say here. All I can do is say that it's a great tale with a great story to tell.

B000286S8S|4.0|This is an interesting collection, no other band has the lead singer controversy that Van Halen has. Still it's a shame there are no pictures of DLR or any cuts or mention of the VH-III Gary Cerone era anywhere. This compilation looks like an attempt by the VH brothers to &quot;blend&quot; the Dave/Sammy eras together and reintroduce themselves to a new era of young fans who were still in grade school when &quot;Balance&quot; came out. The new cuts with Sammy are OK - they all sound like they came from non-serious Jam sessions instead of serious songwriting. I hope VH & Sammy arent just reuiniting for a quick buck reunion tour and will stay together and release a new LP in the future.

B000001EPB|5.0|My daughter is an Irish step dancer, and we've seen the traveling LOTD show. Her school performs to many of the songs. We also own the LOTD dvd. I just bought this disc for her for her birthday, and it is AWESOME...listening to it gives me goosebumps. <br />  <br /> My only negative comment is that the disc does not include all the songs from the show. In particular, the fiddle duet &quot;Strings of Fire&quot; is not there, which is one of my favorite parts of the show.  <br />  <br /> Otherwise, I highly recommend it. I dare you to sit still while listening!
0316286850|3.0|This book was incredibly frustrating for me. Yes, the makeovers are beautiful. But a lot of the photographs are completely worthless -- they're in profile, or they're black and white, or they're soft-focus. There's almost no advice on how to choose a quality makeup product or tool. Most frustrating for me was the fact that the breakdowns on the photographs are egregiously incomplete -- in the Lisa Marie Presley ponytail photo, for example, she's obviously wearing a dark eyeshadow in the crease but there's no crease color mentioned, and in the Trish Goff colored eyeshadow photo she's wearing multiple shades of shadow even though it only says she's wearing one.<br> <br />The other thing that drove me nuts about this book is that almost every single eye shadow look is achieved exclusively with black, white, grey, or brown eyeshadow. I hate basic neutrals and I don't feel they flatter me. I wanted to be shown how to do interesting looks with some colors -- plums, blues, olives? -- and there are literally only three photos in the whole book that have colored eyeshadow. It's really a bizarre juxtaposition of basic, neutral looks with looks that are way too dramatic for anyone but a drag queen or a movie star; nothing in between. Also, it really aggravated me that everyone has flawless skin despite the claims that minimal or no foundation is used.<br> <br />What I do like about this book is the application techniques (instead of just products) and the stellar contouring photo. I also really appreciate the obvious effort made to include women of color. Conclusion: good for the makeup novice or the average woman, or someone who just likes watching transformations. For the person who already has a good grasp on makeup techniques, though, this book is an exercise in frustration.

A friend offered to let me burn her copy of the CD, but I decided to buy it myself instead. They're awesome, and I wanted the real thing. <br />  <br /> Amy Lee has an incredible voice. Anyone who disagrees is just jealous. She is the only female I've ever heard that can actually sing rock. Other girl-fronted rock bands sound like crap. I don't know how anyone couldn't like Evanescence. <br />  <br /> People that are saying Evanescence sounds too much like &quot;Luna Coil&quot; or whatever--you're just mad that your precious band isn't as famous as Evanescence. A lot of bands sound alike, and not all of them become famous. Deal with it. <br />  <br /> If you like music, get this CD. I think it appeals to anyone, no matter what genre of music you're into. And I think anyone can relate to the song lyrics.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This is a very decadent movie. In the movie, all the established relationhips are bad, and only the ones that have not yet developed are good. Love is enduring, fullfiling, and faithful, not betrayal. This is obviously a movie for people who are unhappy in their relationship and are looking around for something else. For me the worst is the the pretension that it is about love.
B000021XS0|5.0|My guitar teacher let me listen to this CD, and told me it would blow me away.....he was right.  <br /> I became a huge Dream Theater fan at that exact second, I listen to it about every day, and take it everywhere I go. <br /> The band is incredible, and they fill it with greatness, it was so much better than anything I have ever heard. They can top any Alternative Rock band, or basically any band that is big right now.  <br /> John Petrucci is awesome, and amazeed me with his guitar licks, tricks, and fast-paced riffs. Mike Portnoy has a huge drumset and uses it to its full extent, he is awesome, and very fast, and has some of the strangest beats out there and they are cool. <br /> John Myung totally whales on the 6-string, fretless bass, and does it so casually. and Jordan Ruddess makes the piano a work of art, and synchronizes with the guitar so perfectly. <br /> James Labrie is possibly the best singer on the planet, although singing quite high, and girly at times, but he is so good, and has hypnotic lyrics. I dont know which is my favorite song, they are all so good, each recieves a 10/10. I highly recommend this album to all people, no matter what choice of music you like. The first time you listen you may think &quot;I dont know about this...&quot; but after you listen to it a couple times straight through, youll think differently, I guarantee it. <br /> Maybe I should say its about a girl who was murdered in 1928 who comes back re-incarnated in the form of a young man named Nicholas, and he gets hypnotized, and tells the story, of how she had an affair with her boyfriend's brother, and the boyfriend killed them both, and committed suicide.....pretty cool huh? Yeah, its kind of creepy, but it is by far the best album on Earth.
B00004Z459|5.0|I don't normally listen to nu metal or alternative music, but this CD is GOOD!! I was so sick and tired of cookie cutter &quot;punk&quot; and other alternative rock bands. They all have one good song and the rest of their album is redundant filler! You can bet I was amazed when I discovered Linkin Park! I like that LP's lyrics actually have something to say. I can really relate to several songs on this album! And they can express their feelings in a creative way without using a mass of obscenities. Now, don't get me wrong. It's not that I'm offended by such language. It just gets old after awhile! Also, there is a lot of variety between the songs. No two songs sound the same! That's very rare in a world of one-hit and one-album wonders! And as for Mike's rapping, I love that I can actually understand what he's saying, unlike other rap/rock artists! Take it from me, I usually listen to pop. And even I like this CD, so that's definitely saying something! This album sold well for a reason! If you don't have it by now, then by all means, go and buy it!
1573227978|4.0|First of all, this book is waaaaaaaaayy better than the movie with Leo in it. And the movie was okay. I read this book in two days...absolutely could not put it down. I loved the character of Richard. He was insecure enough to be real, but brave enough to be interesting. Other characters weren't as well rounded, but this is a plot-driven book, so you really won't even notice all the people are rather flat.  <br />  <br /> The theme of this book has been done over and over, usually better, in &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; and more recently &quot;Drop City&quot;, to name a few. People dissatisfied with society try to create their own utopia. You can see that this is headed nowhere good. The thing that makes this book original is that it is geared specifically towards people my age (25). the main allusions are to video games, Star Wars, &quot;Platoon.&quot; While this is all entertaining, it can be a little trite at times. Perhaps Garland doesn't give his readers enough credit...when Richard at the end mumbles &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; (Kurtz) I almost cringed.  <br />  <br /> But really, this is not a big drawback. It doesn't change the fact that I was riveted from page one. Highly recommended. (If you've travelled through Thailand, this book is all the more interesting)
0316168815|2.0|I've just finished reading The Lovely Bones. This is a book which I had been anticipating reading for a while.  The subject matter seemed intriguing and promised for a touching and compelling read.  After finishing it, I feel that it left me pretty much in emotional limbo.  Like many of the readers, I too wanted very much to like it, and like many of the readers, my dis-ease with it is similar.  The beginning of the book pulls you right in emotionally.  There is a tension about it.  Even though you know that Susie is doomed to die, you root for her and hope against hope that she'll get away.  The grisley murder and the character of Mr. Harvey are chilling and upsetting, and appropriately hateful.  The investigation, the family and town's response are initially all realistic, and the book moves along well.  I'm not sure exactly where it starts to go wrong. I'm not sure exactly when I started to feel like I was plowing through it just to get it read.  It happens gradually and insidiously, but you suddenly realize that the threads of the story have just faded away.  The characters begin to wander and dissipate. While I can understand the mother's frustration over her lost past, her husband's inability to move beyond the murder, as well as dealing with the death of her child, I found her to be too selfish and self-involved for me to care about. I didn't even care when she came back to stay.  I agreed with Buckley's response in the car. The father, while he had my sympathy for his sensitivity, I found to be ineffectual and too weak.  The small exploration into the background of Mr. Harvey I thought promised an opportunity to shed light on his development into a serial killer, but this was briefly touched on and then forgotten about. The character of Lindsay I found to be the most satisfying in that she was the only one who seemed to find an empowering way to deal with the murder.   <br />Many of the other characters and situations seemed not well-developed, so that theybecame annoying, unrealistic and one-dimensional.  Did Mrs. Singh do anything but smoke smelly cigarettes and press flowers into books?  Did Ruth's entire artistic repertoire revolve around Susie?  What about Franny and Holly in heaven? These two I think were the least developed to the point where one wonders what their purpose in the story is at all.  Their heaven seems like a dead end.  Nothing happens, there is no spiritual growth, no revelations about life, death, afterlife.  The scene with Ray and Ruth at the sinkhole and after, which I gather was the climax of the book was unrealistic, contrived, and sappy.  When Ruth was standing at the edge of the sinkhole I thought, perhaps finally Susie's grave will be revealed to this girl. I think that this would have been more satisfying than the sex scene which followed.  I also found the death of Mr. Harvey to be contrived and written in offhandedly as a way of placating the readers. Far-fetched and silly.  Even if the crime was never solved, a better ending could have been found for him than accidental death by icicle. The very end of the story, Samuel and Lindsay moving into the Victorian house, which coincidentally belonged to Ruth's father, the cute ending scene with Lindsay's new baby Susie was trite and too pat.  It also seemed that after all the emotional struggle that Susie undergoes throughout the book.  We don't even get a sense for where or to what she may be headed towards in heaven now that she sees her family moving beyond her death.  After making myself finish the book in the hopes of at least a satisfying or thought-provoking ending, I found that it left me sadly empty.    <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000844M8|5.0|It may be hard to believe that there were classic family films created in the 60s by anyone other than Disney. This movie is an example of a very good and classic family film, one where the only car chase is after a lion, there are no video games to be seen anywhere, and the central themes of the movie are love and that wild things should live free.<br /><br /> This movie is based on a book by Joy Adamson by the same name, and chronicles her and her husband's experiences with a trio of lion cubs. Eventually two of the cubs are sent to a zoo, but the third lion, a lioness that Joy calls Elsa, remains with Joy and her husband George. Of course, lions are wild animals and they can live with people for only so long, and Joy is faced with the need to have Elsa sent to a zoo. Joy is unable to think of Elsa being caged when she has been free for her whole life, so she attempts what had not been done before, repatriation of a captive lion back into the wild.<br /><br /> Elsa and her husband work long, hard and with a lot of frustration, despairing that Elsa would never be able to go back to the wild, or that she would die as a result of their attempts. All along the way you can see Joy Adamson's love for Elsa and her need to see Elsa be able to return to the wild.<br /><br /> Andy Williams sings &quot;Born Free&quot; to accompany the end of the movie. This song is one of Andy Williams' best. If you are familiar with this song you will recognize portions of it are used throughout the movie as a recurring theme.<br /><br /> This movie is simple and heart-warming. There are a few moderately violent scenes, but I would consider this movie appropriate for children of all ages, though with parents watching when the youngest family members watch. This kind of movie is rare in any age, and one to be treasured.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have great news for you all...  I bought the 50 first dates DVD and watched it last night...  The FIRST preview on the DVD is the Seinfeld DVD!!!  I was so excited!!!  The first season will be out soon!!!  Check it out for yourself!!!
0765310015|5.0|The Malazan book of the fallen series is probably the best I have read in the past fifteen years.  Steven Erikson has created a dark and believable world of heroic soldiers, magic, and gods and presents them all in a neutral manner that leaves you guessing as to who are the good and bad characters.  Each book of the planned 10 book series is essentially a stand alone novel.  Because of this each book has a great lead up and climatic struggle which ties into the overall series.   <br /> <br />For those who are about to purchase this book there are a few things that you should know about the history of the malazan empire which will make the reading much easier.   <br /> <br />The Malazan empire at the start of Gardens of the Moon is over one hundred years old and is a multi continent empire encompassing Genabackis (Gardens of the Moon), Seven Cities, Quon Tali, Malaz and Falari Islands, along with expansion wars on several others that have yet to be mentioned in detail.  Dont bother looking to the map early on when the soldiers talk about past battles because most were on the continent of Seven Cities, which is not included on the map.  Also be sure to look at the dates early on to understand when things are happening.   <br /> <br />The rest I will not spoil because one of the most enjoyable things about this series is constantly finding out new facts about each character and the history of the world and empire.   <br /> <br />Have fun reading this excellent book.

B0001LJCMK|3.0|Queens of the Stone Age suck. Vain side-projects suck. This stupidly-titled group is essentially just an excuse for that Craig Kilborn-looking singer of QotSA to play drums. He makes this quite obvious by mixing the drums up as high as he possibly can, to the point where they sometimes nearly drown out the guitar, which is the only other instrument. <br />  <br /> When I popped this CD in my player, my only expectations were that it was going to end up in the garbage can five minutes later. I mean, come on, a guitar/drum bluesy garage-rock duo? This far along in the game?  <br />  <br /> There's nothing groundbreaking or original about &quot;Peace, Love, Death Metal,&quot; but it still somehow manages to surpass the other popular two-pieces of recent years (Led Zeppelin-lite White Stripes, Hendrix-lite Black Keys, and used-to-be-emo bandwagon-jumpers The Kills). The reason for this must be the drums, and although this project does seem quite self-serving, pushing the drums up and taking the emphasis off the guitar is just what this limited &quot;genre&quot; needed.  <br />  <br /> Some of the songs go on for too long (and false stops are way overused), and the singer just can't sing, but overall it's a fun, groovy listen that far surpassed my cynical expectations. I'd recommend it. <br />
0765310015|5.0|Dozens of countries/races/species, hundreds of characters, thousands of years. All of this in just the first book of a projected 10-book series. Erikson's writing is erudite and witty, the ideas are fascinating, the plot is exceedingly complex. This is not a book to read if you want everything laid out predictably, with characters using their conversations to explain things to the reader that the characters themselves would take for granted. I was so impressed that I ordered the next 4 books from Amazon Canada, the kind of thing I've never felt driven to do before. Buy it, read it, think about it.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Minimalist in dialogue, overloaded with directorial flourishes that never threaten to overpower, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE together with Kar-Wai's HAPPY TOGETHER(1998)are two of the most beautiful love stories ever filmed.  The cinematography & score are undoubtedly(aside from two great performances)this film's strongest assets, not least because these two elements complement each other so perfectly. The camera sways & swings with the score & at times enjoys a slow waltz as the cinematographer almost seems to be making love to the extraordinarily beautiful leads through the lens. <br />This film provides indisputable proof that Tony Leung Chiu-Wai(even better in HAPPY TOGETHER)is one of the best actors in the world. Watch him closely, not unlike Morgan Freeman, he barely moves a muscle & yet expresses himself so clearly. And those eyes...
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Bump. Bump. Bump. Wicked bass beats and addicting guitar riffs are the order of the day when pop-rock outfit Franz Ferdinand are cooking up the tunes. With their self-titled debut, the band have served up eleven truly fantastic tracks that are sure to keep you in beat. The first single, ?Take Me Out?, is a dancetastic song featuring confident beats and brain-destroying guitars. Other stand outs include ?This Fire?, a manic song  with 70?s pop-rock influences; ?Jaqueline?, the powerfully loud intro song; and ?Auf Achse?, a melancholy love song with, surprise, some pretty upbeat music.
B0001V07ZQ|1.0|I thought this movie was very tedious. It had one decent battle scene at the beginning and a marginal battle scene at the end. Everything in the middle was uninteresting filler. They spent more time on the Galapagos islands then anywhere else looking at animal specimens that I couldn't care less about. If I wanted that I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau. I was expecting a movie about wooden naval ships, but those were more of a background scene in this movie. The character of the captain was also as shallow and see through as plastic wrap. All the other characters around him has to tell the audience how great the captain is because the captain character sure couldn't demonstrate it on his own. The political correctness was also nauseating. Make better use of your time and money by checking out something else. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000286S8S|3.0|I gave the album three stars because of the track selection and pacing mainly. What's here is mostly great, except for Not Enough. Yuck! Why not put on Don't Tell Me, Aftershock, or Seventh Seal instead? Out of the three new songs, Up For Breakfast is the only one I like. The other two are awful, in my opinion. I like the beginning of &quot;Learning to See&quot;, sounds sort of Stone Temple Pilotish, and then it turns pretty lame. I liked hearing the Hagar stuff remastered, especially the OU812 tunes. With the live tracks, why not put two Sammy songs, and two live Roth songs. Now that would have been cool! Not bad though, all in all. Saw them in Hartford last month, and they were amazing!! <br />  <br /> Bob
B00000IREA|5.0|Barbarella, the beautiful space faring adventurous, has been asked to venture to a distant planet in the backwoods of the universe to find Duran-Duran, a scientist who is threatening the ancient peace.<br /><br />In this spoofy superhero classic, part of the appeal is the old school special effects and the way Barbarella seems to loose her clothing at the drop of a hat. From the free fall strip tease, to the birds and dolls eating away her clothing, and her penchant for giving sex as payment for help... It truly is a product of the 70's. From the very beginning where we learn that the only weapons in existence are in a museum, to the little pill they use for sexual encounters, and the excessive machine... it really is an interesting ride.<br /><br />I do think the PG rating is low. It should be at least PG-13 because there are a lot of sexual situations, and Barbarella does loose her clothing a fair number of times (though she does manage to keep her nipples concealed, even when stark naked). I did let my children watch it and the only part they wondered about was the excessive machine... A hard one to explain.
1592400876|4.0|My initial thought regarding Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves was that it is indeed, startlingly funny. Lynne Truss creates an enjoyable and amusing guide to grammar, centering around the old grammarian joke of a Panda that, quite literally, eats, shoots and leaves. The book covers the basics: commas, apostrophes, colons, semicolons and more. <br />The book was regretably quite short, weighing in at 204 pages. I highly recommend that if anyone is particularly interested in reading this book, that they should consult their local library prior to making an investment, due to the outrageous cost of hardcover books.<br />Within the last chapter of the book, Ms. Truss includes some interesting commentary concerning the future of punctuation in general. It appears to be a bleak one, with increasingly less formal instruction dedicated to the practice. However, this may not be the death of grammar itself. Perhaps the language is evolving to a level of sophistication where by punctuation is no longer needed. Alas, only time will tell.
0140277447|5.0|For the last twenty five years I have become increasingly something of an auto-didactic world war two scholar, and have read so many books on the subject to easily recall or remember. Often in all this time I have had to stop abruptly from reading particular passages in whatever book I happened to be reading to collect my thoughts about what seems to be yet more undeniable proof of the innate murderous impulses of the human animal. This is true, it seems for all combatant entities in all wars. It seems to hold true for every war, for every army, for every conflict. War is the ultimate de-humanizing experience, and it is a central lesson in understanding the constraints and limitations inherent in evaluating mankind's destiny.<br /><br />In truth, we are none of us immune from such blood-lust, whether we be Germans, Serbs, Vietnamese, Russians, Americans, English, Italian, French, Polish, Czech, Chinese, or Japanese (witness, for example, our own murderous treatment of the American Indian populations). Yet the magic of this superb book is to show just how massive, how planned, and how brutal the Japanese incursion into China was, despite the consistent denials by the Japanese government in the several decades since. Like the gruesome Russian purges, or the almost unimaginable scale of the Nazi death machine, the war against the Chinese population of Nanking and the surrounding area was total in its exercise of murderous force.<br /><br />Even as the Japanese mouthed platitudes of acting to free their Chinese 'brothers' of the yoke of western domination, in truth their intent from the very outset was to enslave and dominate the Chinese people for economic and cultural reasons. This is a difficult book to read, but one which is filled with important truths about what happened. Let the Japanese continue to deny it, telling themselves and those naive enough to listen to their attempts to rewrite this revisionist version of history, we who can read and discern can discover the truth. This is an important book, and one I can heartily recommend. Enjoy!iscover the truth. This is an important book, and one I can heartily recommend. Enjoy!  <br />
B000002G7E|5.0|After purchasing the 20th Century Masters CD, this was the first studio release from VU that came into my collection (because Sister Ray was scratched to hell on my first disc). I never looked back and proceeded to acquire the whole of the Velvets' catalog within a couple of years. <br />  <br /> Yes, the cuts on this album are noisy and a bit rough, but all of them are classics. The title track is a pounding sensation with brash cymbals and piano. &quot;The Gift&quot; is a rather humorous and ironic 8-minute story read by Reed, with a &quot;backing&quot; band just kinda jamming. &quot;Lady Godiva&quot; is my favorite track, with eerie vocal effects toward the end when the operation goes wrong. Cale chimes in on this one with his droning viola, it's just awesome. &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; is a quieter, more subdued effort, just as good as any other cut, and the following track is a crass jam with bizarre lyrics. &quot;Sister Ray&quot; is the highlight of this album, and possibly the entire short life of VU. Captured live in one take and supposedly based on the free jazz of Ornette Coleman (according to Reed), it pushes 18 minutes and features fuzzed out organ and guitar, as well as nearly the same pounding drum beat from Moe Tucker. Hypnotic. The heroin / murder / transsexual lyrics sound like accompaniment for one of WS Burroughs' beat novels. <br />  <br /> Although this album is loud, I find that you can just put it on at a reasonable volume and let it melt into the background. I actually find it RELAXING after awhile (is this possible?) All in all, an essential album for the true Velvet Underground fan.
B000002C2E|3.0|I think half this record is excellent, the other half lame. I agree with a previous review - I don't understand the acclaim and Grammy. I'm a huge Lanois fan and love his production here. But even that can't save the pedestrian lyrics Bob treats us to here on many cuts. But 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are vintage, well worth the price of admission by themselves. <br /> <br />DR
B000001GQB|3.0|I noticed something odd when I listened to this version and the John Eliot Gardiner version of Mozart's last (41st) symphony. Gardiner plays at a FASTER tempo...yet the Bohm recording is shorter!!?!      After a head to head comparison, it became obvious: DG, Bohm, and the BPO decided to chop a full ten minutes right out of the symphony. The finale is only half its proper length, and the first two movements suffer similar fates. THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE RECORDING.      In addition, I take exception to the 40th, which seems to also have been altered in places. Also, the opening movement to the 40th is, as another reviewer pointed out, agonizingly slow even though Mozart marked it \\"very fast\\".       But other than that, the CDs are fine. The four other symphonies are pristine and beautiful and, as far as I know, mostly or completely intact. They are well recorded and well played. No wrong notes or odd tempi here, folks.      But if you're going to buy this, do yourself a favor and buy a separate recording of the last two Symphonies (Gardiner's is my favorite). This set isn't even giving you the full symphonies. In fact, if you are really feeling generous towards yourself, go buy the Naxos box set \\"Mozart: 15 Famous Symphonies,\\" which gives you two-and-a-half times the music for just $10 more, in brilliant (and occasionally benchmark) performances with DDD sound.      Hate to spoil the party, but the truth is: the stuff they play here is excellent...but the stuff they don't play is sorely missed.    (This review has been edited on discovery of some factual errors...should be OK now. Importantly, I've learned that it's common practice to omit repeats in Mozart's slow movements, but NOT in the other movements...Bohm chops them out everywhere, most notably in the finale of the 41st as mentioned.)
044651652X|5.0|I finished reading this book about twenty minutes ago and started writing this while the book was still fresh in my mind, in my soul.  I?m not going to get into what the book is about because I think most everyone already knows that, so I?ll disband with the redundancies. I?ve been hearing about The Bridges of Madison County for several years now, first heard about it when I was at a seminar at Presbyterian College in South Carolina. Finally, I read Stephen King?s book about writing and King stated that this book was a terrible book.  So, out of curiosity, I decided to finally give Bridges a read. Though I?ve always liked King?s work and admired the man for what he?s done, I think he better read this book again.  My favorite mainstream writer has always been Ernest Hemmingway.  In this text, I enjoyed the simplicity of a heartfelt story told, the same as Hemmingway always affected me.  If you like to read something that will grab you in the heart, read The Bridges of Madison County.  I thought this was a very good novel.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This movie is odd - very odd, but in a Good Way. It's not the Yellow Brick Road, but it *is* a fun journey toward Father & Son Reunion, with a wonderous cast along the Way.<br /><br /> Reviewed by TundraVision &lt;-that's my Amazon Reviewer Name & I'm stickin' to it!
B00003CXCT|2.0|1. This is not real widescreen. GOD what a dissapointment this purchase was! I knew that this edition had added CG effects, some of which are good and some ridiculous like the singer in Jabba's house, but decided that I could live with that. The real problem is the picture-format!! The top and bottom of the picture in all three movies has simply been masked, to suit widescreen TVs.  <br /> <br />In RETURN OF THE JEDI, look for example at the chapter index picture of Jabba's fortress with a frog creature in the foreground, and compare it to the picture in the film. How enjoyable is it to see a panorama landscape view with a fortress in the distance with the top cupolas chopped off?? It is AWFUL!!! Furthermore the color nuances are all gone in this scene, it's all reddish!!  <br /> <br />And how enjoyable is it to see tops of heads chopped off?? It is AWFUL!!!  <br /> <br />Why do they have to mask the top and bottom of the picture??? If they hade left it whole, a widescreen TV would still not show the top and bottom because it would not fit, so it wouldn't make a difference! But on a normal TV it does! Furthermore, widescreen TVs are not actually that wide, so they still show black stripes at top and bottom with this edition!  <br /> <br />This proves that superficial proportions of the picture is more important than the actual content and integrity of the art. IS Star Wars art? Well, I respect George Lucas for his vision and work, but a real artist would surely not treat his own work in this abusive manner.  <br /> <br />(The widescreen editions of the newest Staw Wars films, part I, II, and III, is a different matter. They are complete in picture. They are great.)  <br /> <br />2. The Bonus Disc doesn't satisfy real fantasy fans. Where are the detailed pictures of all creatures and original sculptures? Phil Tippet's Rancor? The frog creature ouside Jabba's nest? The chessboard creatures? The new long-necked dinosaur creature at Mos Eisley? Those are the kind of things we want to see up close! For the layman's pleasure, and for future generations of fantasy creators to learn from. Why do you deny us that George?
B00008973Q|5.0|You have to see it to believe it.  This is the Bard's play in 16th Century Japan.  Our King Lear carves up the kingdom and it is downhill from there.  No sisters in this version, warlike brothers battle for supremacy.  The good brother is banished and the old man comes to see the mistake he made and the devastation.  I am not going to try to give you all the Japanese names.  Understand that the evil witch of a Japanese wife can be the downfall of any warlord.  The battle scenes are probably the best ever filmed.  The colors of the banners and costumes jump right off the screen.  The blood is very red.  This canvas is so rich; there are interior scenes that could have been painted by Rembrandt. In the top fifteen films ever made, Ran is Akira Kurosawa?s masterpiece.

B00005JMYG|3.0|MOVIE: This movie is just one big SNL skit made feature lengthed. The movie I compared this most to was Dodgeball. I was looking for similarities and differences between the two and unfortunetly found more similarities. Even though Will Ferrel co-wrote the movie it didn't really click. What I liked was that many of the jokes had a reference to something and even if they were random they still had some part in what was going on at the time during the scene. Dodgeball lacked hilarity because none of the jokes had a reference they were just blurbs of utter stupidity. This movie is not only making fun of the 70's era it makes fun of the news, jazz lounges, street gangs, men, and the rest of the jokes fall under the random category. What really hurts the movie is that the jokes are forced. Everyone in the audience will probably laugh in sync because all the jokes in this movie are physical comedy. Everything that you laugh at will be visually provoked. If you think about it, nothing that the characters say is funny. Imagine the &quot;glass case of emotion&quot; scene without Ferrel flopping around and crying hysterically. See! The laughs are forced but so goes with SNL, so it is a very enjoyable movie, but the second time around you wont laugh.<br /><br /> ACTING: Will Ferrel is Will Ferrel. His acting is the same as it was on SNL and even more similar to Zoolander. He is big, loud, and funny. Nothing new, just the same ol' Will that we love. Steve Carell (The Daily Show, Bruce Almighty) is the funniest guy in the movie. He plays the dumbfounded weatherman who makes the funniest cracks throughout the movie. I feel that he was the only real thing that worked perfectly in the movie, you didn't get tired of him but you didn't miss him either. The cameos in this movie were actually &quot;cameos&quot;. Dodgeball had the stupidest cameos ever, and they were so pointless. Will Ferrel invites some of his buddies including past co-stars Vince Vaugn, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller to join the fun as well as some familiar faces from SNL. The cast is fun no doubt about it.<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: You will laugh at the movie, but the laughs are very forced and seeing it the second time around will be dull. Today's comedies are starting to become so repetitive and it makes me wonder if comediens like Peter Sellers, Mel Brooks, John Candy, Bill Murray, and other greats will ever have an influence on future comediens.r to join the fun as well as some familiar faces from SNL.

B00003CXBH|4.0|Roland Joffe's film on sin, faith,and redemption set in South America during the mid-18th century. Although the acting sometimes seems to lack the emotion it should have, the beautiful cinematography and its individual scenes more than make up for the film's defects.      Jeremy Irons plays a peaceful Jesuit missionary who seeks to establish a mission among a tribe of Indians near the falls of Iguacu on the borders of modern Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. At first hostile and suspicious, the natives slowly begin trusting the missionary and some convert. This peaceful setting is soon shattered when Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro)comes to hunt the natives to meet the demands of a growing slave market. Mendoza later becomes a shattered man upon commiting a cardinal sin and prepares to end his life. Mendoza is soon persuaded by the Jesuit that his salvation is ensured only in the service of God and enrolls himself as a missionary. In penitence, Mendoza arrives to serve the mission housing his Indian victims. In the meantime, the Jesuit order has fallen out of favor with Portugal and Spain's political interests. In an effort to compromise, the Vatican orders the mission dismantled. Fearing that members of his native parish will once again be abducted as slaves once he leaves, the missionary chooses to stand his ground in peaceful defiance. Familiar with the expedient practices of the Portuguese, Mendoza chooses to resist the eviction by force if necessary.      The film is shot on location and the viewer is captivated by the pristine beauty of the falls of Iguacu. The roar of the falls and the lush vegetation strengthen the themes of the story. I found the acting to be somewhat uneven however. Jeremy Irons is a little to timid for his role. Although Robert De Niro plays his role quite well as the mercenary, his expressions of rage along with his slips into his NY accent reminded me more of his character in &quot;Taxi Cab&quot;. The director should have also directed his shots more carefully when the story emphasized on emotional/psychological turmoils.      This is still a great movie despite some of its flaws and is worthy of being in someone's collection. I strongly recommend it. If you liked this film, I would also recommend Herzog's &quot;Aguirre: The Wrath of God&quot; with Klaus Kinski.
0312995423|3.0|I was bound and determined to read every single one of Dan Brown's books. I read 'The Da Vinci Code.' Then, I read 'Angels & Demons,' followed by 'Deception Point,' and then 'Digital Fortress.' I should have given myself some time after 'Deception Point.' <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed all of Dan Brown's novels through 'Deception Point.' But by the time I read 'Digital Fortress,' I was able to predict exactly whodunnit and the plot twists. In fact, Brown's writing style is so stenciled out that I knew who the bad guy was from the second chapter (or fifth page...). <br /> <br />'Digital Fortress' started a lot slower than his other books, but ended up picking up the pace toward the last 10% of the book. <br /> <br />Although the novel was good, I was still antsy waiting for it just to end. It seemed to drone on longer than the others, too. <br /> <br />If you read this book, don't let it be the final book of Dan Brown's that you read. Perhaps read 'Digital Fortress' after 'The Da Vinci Code,' or I at least recommend that you wait at least a few weeks in between books.
B00008EY65|5.0|I went to see this three times. I never do that.  In fact, I didn't really want to see it in the first place.  I took my grandson, because he is a big Spiderman/superhero fan.  While the continuity is flawed (people who are seemingly important to the movie seem to just fade into the sunset), from start to finish, Hellboy is a wild, escapist ride.  Which is what this movie is, escape. Anyone who is looking for a cinematographic masterpiece will be disappointed. Try and see it through the eyes of an 8-year-old.  We were all young once.  This brings us back in touch with those days when comic books were one of our main sources of entertainment.  This movie just simply rocks.
0553296981|5.0|It is said that Anne Frank's famous diary is the second most best-selling book in the world, next to the Bible. It is hardly surprising that the deeply moving story of Anne Frank has touched so many hearts and made so many curious to read the intimate details of her life through her own words, a life of years of hiding in an attic with her family so that the Nazis wouldn't find and deport them to a concentration camp. Tragically, someone betrayed and informed on them, and they were arrested in 1944 and put on what turned out to be the last train from Holland to Auschwitz. And even more tragically, Anne died only about a month before the camp was liberated in 1945.<br /><br /> David Rehak<br /><br /> author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B00005JM1F|5.0|I saw Old School for the first time the other day. I had high expctations knowing I was about to watch a Todd Phillips movie(Road Trip, Starsky & Hutch) starring three of the funniest guys in Hollywood with Will Ferrel, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn. I wasn't let down at all. <br /> <br />Mitch Martin(Wilson) is in his early thirties and works in the real estate business. He goes home one night to find his girlfriend with some other people and the relationship is off. In his depression he goes and buys a house up near the local Harrison University. <br /> <br />Frank(Ferrel) is getting married. He is a little unsure of marrigae but does it anyways. He however can't pass up the chance to party with Mitch at his new place. <br /> <br />Beanie(Vaughn) is a millionaire. He owns six electornic stores and he looks at Mitch's new place as a huge opportunity. The place is right by the school that means one stop long party every night and everyday. <br /> <br />The first party is a blast and Mitch becomes a hero to these local university students. However, there fun is stopped short by Dean Pritchard(Piven) who says they can't live in student housing. They have until the end of the week to leave. The guys don't like that idea and they decide to start a fraternity. <br /> <br />They get there pledges and the fraternity is on. Pritchard won't stop though and he will do anything to shut them down. Now the guys  must keep the party rolling and stop Pritchard before he stops them. <br /> <br />This movie is hilarious. There isn't anything not to like about it. The three major stars make the movie. Will Ferrel is one of the funniest guys alive. Old School is his funniest movie to date. Vince Vaughn is the man. He's his normal funny self and Luke Wilson is great. It's the funniest movie of his carear. You have to love these three guys in the movie. <br /> <br />I love Old School. This reminded me a lot of Animal House and a lot have labeled it as this generations Animal House and Iagree. This is a great frat humor movie and if you love that kind of stuff you will love Old School. If you prefer a cleaner comedy than this is not your ideal movie. <br /> <br />Check Old School out. It's a great movie that has all the fun stuff from college. Be prepared to laugh and have a good time.
0141439831|5.0|I first read this novel twenty-five years ago, and while I found it funny and excellent entertainment at that time, I didn't realize that it is also a very great book. Now I do.  <br />  <br /> Readers who've found the novel too long are, I suspect, not regular readers of Victorian novels, which were traditionally published in newspapers, bit by bit. They're always long--that's their distinction from modern novels. More than most however, Vanity Fair opens with a bang, and from the first page on through more than 800, I found it hard to put down. <br />  <br /> Through the cast of characters we see for ourselves the pervasive greed and hypocrisy of the 19th century British Empire. Jos Sedley, the Ex-collecter of Bogley Walla, the unfortunate Rawdon Crawley, George Osborne and the immoral, resourceful Becky Sharpe are some of the most vivid characters in English writing. The narrator's voice is perfect--though hardly appealing. It's not sentimental. The &quot;objectivity&quot; of a journalist's timidly expressed irony feeds into the reader's need to feel smug -- so that when shocking moments come (and they sure do) we are stunned. The narrator's voice here is much more inventive than one realizes immediately. In this and many other ways Thackeray's story-telling isn't typical of Victorian novelists--Eliot or Dickens for example. In the works of those authors we always know just what moral position the narrator has. (I should mention that I also finished re-reading Middlemarch before re-reading Vanity Fair.) Comparing the grand stateliness of George Eliot with Thackeray's voice made me see just what a tricky work of art Vanity Fair is. But Thackeray, too, makes his story come to life. The description of the Battle of Waterloo is one of the most brilliant things I've ever read. It's hard to believe that he wasn't there. <br />  <br /> In the edition I read I found that C.L.R. James, the left-wing Trinidadian author and historian--an author I admire and enjoy reading, began reading Vanity Fair at the age of eight, and re-read it regularly throughout his long life. He claims to have learned more about the minds of white colonial empire-builders from this original and epic work than any history he read. Interesting...
B00005A8GY|2.0|I was disappointed - great music, poor sound. Just stereo version, bad quality. If you like classic rock, better buy QUEEN \\"A Night At The Opera\\", DEEP PURPLE \\"Machine Head\\" and PINK FLOYD \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\". Great and powerful 5.1 sound!!(...)
1558216847|5.0|I've noticed some sceptical reviews of this adventure.Boy, there are some cynical people in the world!  Are there huge black snakes in the Gobi? has any snake expert confirmed this as a fact or fiction? I presumed that this actually happened. What an incredible journey with such suffering!  It's a great testament to what the human body can endure.  Read it for that!
078322804X|5.0|this is easily one of my favorite movies. it is a classic!!! its a shame that they stopped making it, but im glad i got mine before they stopped making it. this is a movie that has comedy, action, and believe it or not pretty good music. john belushi was a great comedian as he was an actor, it is a shame that he died before he could of made a lot more classics, including the 2nd blues brothers....so to summarize, if you dont have this movies try to get it anywhere or you will really miss out!
6305508550|4.0|Don't spend time reading all the critics. If you're here, its because you have some interest in this particular movie. So, here's the deal: I'm from Mexico (and our humor it's a little different from yours), I'm not a fan of Beavis & Butthead neither King of the Hill, I dont know the Milton reference, I'm not in love with Jennifer Aniston and I only watch the movie once so many years before, but I have to own this movie now. Why? Cause I still cant' forget how great it is! pure and simple. <br />Everything in there (story, characters, funny situations from beggining to end) is a hit. This is the kind of movie worth seeing 5 times a year (at least). Too bad the DVD has zero cool extras (an insult for the fans and the great movie that contains). Five stars for the movie, 3 for the DVD. <br />Trust me: buy it, see it and enjoy it.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Huge Sarah fan that I am, this album has been my least favorite...the lyrics aren't so moving and the music is lacking something that FTE and Surfacing had captured so well.  Hopefully in another 6-7 years Sarah's next album will have a more emotional pull for me.  A couple of songs I did enjoy on the album were World on Fire and my favorite, Stupid (FTE like in sound, but way too short!!!!!).
1594200106|5.0|Being an especially discerning reader, I am pleased to admit that I can find absolutely nothing lacking in this utterly spectacular novel.  I listened to it on unabridged audio cassette, a particularly well done production that is performed by Jonathan Davis and peppered with a liberal sprinkling of original music composed by the author himself.  At the more than satisfactory conclusion, I found myself in an emotional quandary:  saddened that the last sentence recounting a most exciting sequence of events was echoing in my head, smiling from ear to ear at the pleasing way Zafon ties all the loose ends for all his protagonists, major and minor and needing desperately to wipe my eyes at the last most lasting and endearing images.<br /><br />Zafron is second to Scherazade, herself; he is a master storyteller, well deserving of the famed Victor Hugo/Julian Carax Mont Blanc pen of which he writes.  He binds his tale of a pair of parallel personal histories with the sure skillful hand of a rope maker, twisting and braiding one episode after another in an assured free flow of narration that never fails to compel the reader to desire more, to turn that next page and begin that next chain reaction in a double helix of adventure and personal discovery.  Set against a backdrop of the magical city of Barcelona during the 40s and 50s, narrator Daniel Sempere, living with his widowed father, a seller of books, comes of age.  From the very first page, he plunges headlong into his recount of circumstances that sweeps the reader along with him in a sumptuous indulgence that one can only incur from reading a good book such as this one.  We are privileged to hear age old truth from the wise and lusty Fermin; we encounter truth and beauty from all those who protect the memory of Julian Carax.  Our eyes mist at the simple selfless love between parent and child, community for its individuals and that extended to the elderly through the middle aged.  Evil crawls within the shadows of  a city tainted by war and treachery and personified ingeniously by the ruthless Inspector Fumero.  Yet, romantic love flourishes as Daniel finds and loses his dream girl and then curiously seems to relive the moments in the life of the mysterious author, Julian Carax to whom he is indelibly bound.  Above all, we are treated to a novel about that which we readers love best:  a lost book and its unappreciated author, pining for his lost love in a exiled garret in Paris while his life?s work is destroyed by a crazed madman.<br /><br />I will not give you any more details concerning ?The Shadow of the Wind.?  Know only that I believe it to be the most satisfying novel that I have read in at least the last 10 years.  After a listening session, I found myself pondering the permutations of possibilities, yet never once did I see the entire picture until the very end. I looked forward to predictabilities but as this novel differs from any that I have recently read, there are none.  I was happily spellbound throughout and give it my highest recommendation.  I will humbly ask Mr. Zafon not to sell the rights to this masterpiece to any film producer; like Beatriz, I desire only to filter in the images and the dramatic persona through my own sieve of experience.  I want no interpretation embodied within the medium of film.  To see, to smell, to hear and feel the undercurrents coursing through this work within the boundless confines of one?s own mind, is all that is necessary.  Bravo M. Zafon; I impatiently await your next work with great anticipation and appreciation.city tainted by war and treachery and personified ingeniously by the ruthless Inspector Fumero.

B000002UAC|5.0|The older I get the more I fear that the later generations are starting to view the Beatles as some kind of &quot;pop&quot; phenomenon much in the same way they catagorize Elvis by his movie music years. This album shows what got our collective attention in the first place. It rocked with an abandonment of restraint and a total commitment to enthusiasm. Just listen to Ringo's straightforward drumming and the joy in John and Paul's vocals. This was one helluva band, not just some collection of marketable faces. This cd will not let you forget that.
B00009V7PJ|3.0|I really don't like to get Cher fans mad at me being one myself, but this concert was simply a repeat of the 99 Believe Tour with different costumes and a few song changes.<BR>I went to go see this show live in Toronto and it was really well done, however it was because it was live.<BR>The person who wrote the review comparing it to Madonna is sadly mistaken, all Madonna's tours are different and unique.<BR>The extra's on this DVD are alright as well, best being the 3 extra performances.
B00006AW2G|2.0|Musically, this Stones cd is a true classic. (My rating of two stars reflects the SACD remix, not the music.) However, with regards to the SACD version, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! There is virtually no improvement with the SACD. I played the SACD through a very expensive sound system and compared it to the digitally remastered cd version (several times) and was disappointed. (Yes, I was using a SACD player in the proper mode.) I feel the digitally remastered cd brings back and enhances the &quot;original sound&quot;. Hopefully, the Rolling Stones will release the remainder of their music in SACD surround sound. Ok, perhaps the multi-channel concept doesn't work for older material, but I'm confident the listener will appreciate it for their later material.  <br />  <br /> All in all, SACD is a great concept providing the remix is in multi-channel 5.1 or 6.1 surround sound. However, as noted above, a two channel SACD really offers no substantial sound improvement (over the digitally remastered CD).
B00000AFGM|5.0|In 1996, Marilyn Manson released the album &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. It sparked widespread controversy due to many people misunderstanding the theme. Therefore, many protested against their concerts claiming the lead singer of the same name preaches satanism. However, in 1998, they released the album &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; that would explore a newer Marilyn Manson. They traded the unusual goth clothing for a glam-rock appearance that some say returns to the David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust days.  <br />  <br /> Aside the image, they experiment with different and more mellow rock sounds that match well with their wardrobes. Some songs contain other musical genres that offer the added creative sound: electronica and psychedelic rock. Such variety offers a great musical journey throughout the album, starting with &quot;Great Big Wide World&quot;. Marilyn Manson, the band, wrote these songs wonderfully while never misplacing a note. Despite the more mellow approach, some songs remain raunchy as before. In fact, the lyrics give the mellow songs its signature edge. The newfound drug theme remains interesting, always keeping listeners' close attention to the words. Manson sings these them very expressively, keeping the hardcore edge intact. He screams them and croons them at the perfect moments. One must tremendously respect him for expressing such issues openly. Therefore, he speaks to a nation wonderfully. <br />  <br /> Though the glam-rock phase was temporary, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is an album that listeners will never forget. This is sure to please many rock fans.
B00006AW2J|3.0|Ok, Stones fans, <br />  <br /> Most of us raved about the music on this cd. Face it, it was during the &quot;Classic Stones era&quot;. However, with regards to the SACD, there is virtually no sound quality difference/improvement between the digitally remastered cd and the SACD. (The goal here (with SACD) was to give it the original vinyl sound that may have been lost when transferring to cd.) If you have the original or remastered cd version, keep it. Don't bother picking up the SACD!!! In fact, don't purchase a SACD unless it is in multi-channel 5.1 or 6.1 surround sound.
B000065VB0|4.0|supposedly his masterpiece, right? eh, i expected more, i guess. what's most interesting to me about this album is its dark, heavy, industrial atmosphere. some of the rhythms and samples in these songs are just plain wicked. so that's pretty neat: a stark contrast with his later pop-chart personna. &quot;biko&quot; is a personal fave...
B00006GA48|5.0|We all have our favorite bands, Beatles, Deep purple, James gang, 80'd music and 90's music. We have my beloved Grateful Dead, and the Moody Blues. So many bands, so much music, our lives are permeated with it. <br />  <br /> But no band in history stood up and slapped you sillier than Grand Funk Railroad. There was no thrill like setting 5 rows back and having Mel's bass go right through you on its sonic trip to oblivion. No thrill like watching Mark's lead guitar frenzies and the words he sang. At one time GFR was the loudest band on earth. <br />  <br /> Grand Funk Railroad in its later years fought against drug use amongst teens, started the Pheonix House in NYC, did free concerts to advertise not living on drugs, donated monies to rehabs and in general cared about every person that came into contact with them, either through the music or their &quot;ministry&quot; against drugs. <br />  <br /> Get one of their live CD's, turn it up very loud, until the wife screams, back it off just a touch and let the 70's come home. <br />  <br /> Come on, ride the railroad one more time. Love the music. <br />  <br /> (In case you think I am predjudiced, I come from a very small town outside Flint Michigan. I seen GFR before they were famous, when part of them was the Pack. Heck yes I am!)
B000068PQ0|4.0|not quite as good as soft bulletin, but still a very high quality record. i think i'm going to put it in right now. i can't get enough of the first song (excellent cat stevens rip-off though it is). anywho, it looks like they're going the way of radiohead. only--and this is a very important distinction--they haven't forgotten that their fans like catchy songs. lots of electronic stuff here, but all tasteful. reminds me strongly of tortoise. and wayne's voice makes sure that you don't take it too seriously...thom should take notes.
B000063JDE|3.0|I'm just curious as to why people keep referring to this movie as &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;..it really wasn't.It wasn't graphic or gory or anything..I watched this movie last nite with the expectations that it was going to be incredibly weird and freaky and thought provoking..well it really wasn't-it pretty much just had a basic murder mystery plot..I'm not saying it was a bad movie,it wasn't really and I liked the way music played a big role in the film,I just honestly don't understand what the big deal surrounding this movie is.
B000002KKC|5.0|the strangest ridiculously popular album ever recorded. i went through a major fleetwood mac phase last month (thankfully restricted to the three masterpieces, the self-titled record, rumors and this one). lindsey buckingham's influence is strong here, and not only does it give the band a MUCH needed dose of weirdness and an element of surprise, it also predicts the course of buckingham's rewarding solo career. all in all, i think i like this fleetwood mac album the best--and &quot;the ledge&quot; is undoubtedly my favorite song--but it's hard to beat the sheer hit-power perfection of rumors.

B0001XAPX8|3.0|After seeing the flick, I think the whole point of the book and film was for P. Roth to have an opportunity to bash political correctness. C'mon! I went to college in the 1990s: I know that there would have been faculty and students who would have defended a professor that used the term &quot;spook&quot; without knowing he was referring to absent black students. Later, the protagonist's sister hears this and says, &quot;Are people getting stupider?&quot; Hello, you need to not be worrying about PC and starting getting upset about your brother abandoning his black family of origin. People associate PC with liberals and it's liberals who have set the societal conditions under which black men and white women can fall in love without the black man having to pass.  <br />  <br /> I just don't see the point. This movie could have been powerful like &quot;Monster's Ball&quot; gluing together how an older man and a younger woman with nothing in common could get together. Instead, this was just PC-bashing. I agree with all the critics: Nicole Kidman (as fabulous as she as) was terribly miscast and this movie was far from Oscar-worthy.
B000001AKM|5.0|There is no denying that Lionel Richie is a superstar in the soul music genre.  <br /> A lot of soul fans will disagree with this statement as Richie has become very middle of the road with his more recent music. Even some of the songs on this set will have soul boys turning up there noses. <br />  <br /> &quot;Back To Front&quot; has tracks on it which will be forever marked as &quot;Classic&quot;. Some of the tracks are no doubt on the slushy side. &quot;Hello&quot; the most notable one with the annoying video. But its vintage Richie. Its beautiful, corny and beautiful again.  <br /> &quot;My Destiny&quot; is another classic. Its of course catchy but one which showcases the voice that he possess.  <br /> &quot;All Night Long&quot; again is classic and one of the many many Richie songs that gets so much radio play. Everyone knows this song. Its typical accessable Lionel Richie - a song for all. <br /> &quot;Easy&quot; is perhaps the best ever song written by the man. Sung while still with the Commadores, &quot;Easy&quot; is a track you can't hate.  <br />  <br /> Ballads have always been his forte. And all the classics are here in the bucket loads. <br /> One of the best duets of all time, &quot;Endless Love&quot; with Diana Ross is here, with the heart wrenching &quot;Stuck On You&quot; the soulful &quot;Penny Lover and the anthem &quot;Say You Say Me&quot;. <br /> Its all here on this excellent and now so cheap history of a superstar - Lionel Richie. <br />  <br /> His music may not be &quot;black&quot; enough for some, and yes true he does attract a more middle of the road radio 2 listener - but that doesn't detract from the fact that Lionel Richie has had hit after hit and has made classic after classic.  <br />
B0000844IT|5.0|Great movie, but it is overpriced here.
B00009TB5G|4.0|&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is without doubt the best of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films. The second of the three, it features better acting and character development than the first or the third, and moves smoothly from one event or location to the next without confusing the viewer. It's a nice vehicle for Viggo Mortensen as the reluctant heir to the kingdom of Gondor, and features an entertaining, hammy performance by Brad Dourif as the sinister Grima Wormtongue. Ian McKellan is a wonderful Gandalf, Christopher Lee is perfect as Saruman, and most of the supporting players are quite good, although we get a little tired of Elijah Wood's mournful puppydog act as the ringbearing Frodo. &quot;Towers&quot; contains the best battle scene of the three movies: the battle at Helm's Deep (the third installment, &quot;Return of the King,&quot; has so many CG battle scenes that they become repetitive and boring), and the best scenes of interaction among the various inhabitants of Middle Earth. Cinematography is splendid, as are costumes and the architectural details that distinguish, for example, the court of Theoden at Edoras, in Rohan. Disappointing elements include Peter Jackson's alteration of the character of Faramir, and the scenes in which Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath are jarring; the Faramir of Tokien's novel is a much more interesting, likable person. In spite of these problems, the film as a whole is extremely impressive, and deserves to be ranked as one of the best fantasy/adventure movies ever made.

0446677450|3.0|I bought this book and cash flow quadrant after I purchased &quot;Choose To Be Rich&quot; program(which costed me a whooping $250!!). The CTBR kit had about 12 CDs and three books and a lot of other unneccesary stuff. What I found after reading and comparing the books with the kit was that there is absolutely no difference between the information presented there and the information presented in these two books Rich D Poor D and Cash Flow Quadrant. Also comes with the kit are memberships to associations that I never asked for such as Fortune-Builder (which I just cancelled). The CDs had Mr.Kiyosaki talk about the  <br /> books he wrote and the ones he plans to write (essentially marketing for his products). He also introduces a few advisors who will tell you that you should become financially literate and also should hire people who are more knowledgable than you. <br /> If you ask me, the whole kit could be reduced to 2-3 CDs and 1 book. <br />  <br /> The bottomline: The books do have some useful information... 50% of which is common sense(thanks to the wonderful internet) and other 50% is about building an attitude to become rich(This is where the books are useful. Usefulness of the books also depends on your personality and your values.) If you are really interested in knowing what Kiyosaki's has to offer, I think Rich Dad and Poor Dad is good enough... The rest of the books and kits etc are a rehash and an expansion of what is presented in RDPD.
6305428042|3.0|Well, this movie is difinitly better than The Nightmare before Christmas, and it's right up there with casper. But, I don't even Beetlejuice comes close to this one. I don't know which witch I liked best. Well, of course Bette Midler is right up there along with Sara Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy. yyou just never know what those three will conjur up next. Everyone else was good too. The Headless Billy, Mr. Hollywood, and Tweddledee and Tweeddledumb added to the highlights. Not to mention, The one and only Devil of the neighborhood. This one deserves at lest a one showing. I liked it. It's Holloween at its finist!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy steal the show in Love Actually and rise above the rest of the cast.  Thompson is wonderful as the stay-at-home mom who has to confront the fact that her husband is romantically interested in a young officemate; her performance is a combination of sweet, wry humor and deep hurt.  Then there's Nighy, as a crude and raunchy ex-rocker who, in one of the movie's best scenes, shows that he has a heart...  and a love for the most unexpected person! <br /> <br />The rest of the film wasn't as great as I expected it to be.  The jokes were not all funny, and the numerous storylines made the movie sort of shallow; it had a glossy, frosty, holiday feel to it.
B000286S8S|3.0|I have no one but myself to blame for buying this CD. I knew exactly what I was getting into. But for some reason I confuse nostalgia with quality, and end up putting out good money for music that I remember from high school and grade school. Notice that I didn't say &quot;music that I remember LIKING from high school and grade school&quot;. That's a key distinction. I did this with KISS, and now I made the same mistake again with Van Halen: I bought greatest hits CDs from both bands, thinking somehow that just because it was popular and regularly played back in the day means that it will still be good. There are certainly many bands that I started listening to when I was younger that remain good today- Bruce, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, to name just some of the obvious ones. But others, like Van Halen and Kiss, weren't very good then and aren't very good today.  <br />  <br /> To their credit, Van Halen consists of some masterful musicians. No one can play guitar like Van Halen. No one can make those drums thump and thunder like Van Halen (or more likely, whoever mixed their songs). The problem is, their music is at best mediocre, and at worst outright dumb. Loud screeching guitar riffs that sounded reasonably cool back in middle school now sound like a Spinal Tapish-parody. Endless lyrics about skanky women now don't even sound clever enough to be labeled politically incorrect. Had they any song-writing abilities, I think that Van Halen would rank with Led Zep as one of the great hard rock bands in history. As it is, they just come across as tedious and boorish. <br />  <br /> That being said, there's still something compulsively listenable and likable about Van Halen. I don't have a problem with either Sammy or Dave, but Dave brings a bit more fun and power to the vocals. Their covers are classics, almost eclipsing Roy Orbison and the Kinks. &quot;Jump&quot; is the greatest synth song ever recorded, and doesn't sound as dated as you'd think. And there's just something about playing Van Halen very loud in your car on a hot summer day that just takes you back to fun, simpler times... <br />  <br /> As for the CD itself, it's a decent collection of their hits, a few popular album tracks and b-sides and three passable new songs to entice those who already own the entire catalog. The live stuff seems a bit redundant and tacked on- they could have picked a few more album cuts to fill out the discs and left the live stuff for a separate &quot;Live&quot; greatest hits set.  <br />

B000001EG6|5.0|Despite the passage of 34 years, and the release of zillions of other Elton John records since the release of this, Elton's second studio album, it still remains his best record in my opinion. By 1970, 23-year-old Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin had been writing together for 3 years, and had created a large cache of very good original songs and of these, the 10 songs here were selected to be recorded in a really good studio by expert producer Gus Dudgeon with high-quality orchestration from arranger/conductor Paul Buckmaster and professional studio sidemen to augment the basic trio of Elton (voice, piano), Nigel Olsson (drums) and the late Dee Murray (bass). Elton really stepped up into the international league with the quality of his tunecraft and excellent vocals on this album, and the songs have a timeless, classic feel to them.  <br />  <br /> In particular, I love the tune The Greatest Discovery, which conjures up the magical world of a small child greeting his newborn sibling for the first time. Elton sings this so beautifully. The hit tune Your Song is very familiar now from countless radio and concert hearings, but it still has the ability to enchant with its sincerity and charm . It became Elton's first international hit single in February 1971, and his most enduring standard. The trio of innocently-delightful love songs is completed by I Need You To Turn To, which has another memorable melody, and an unusual harpsichord intro.  <br />  <br /> At the other end of the scale, we have the rockers Take Me To The Pilot,(with a famously-indecipherable meaning !!!), The Cage , and the country-styled No Shoestrings On Louise. These are good, but the Elton John Band still had a few years to go before hitting their peak as a full-on rock phenomenon in the mid-70's.  <br />  <br /> Another classic song is Border Song (Holy Moses), which has a gospel style and an impassioned plea of &quot;Let us, let us live in peace...&quot; The evocative poem First Episode At Hienton is about the shedding of youthful innocence and is also really good, while Sixty Years On looks even further ahead in the life cycle to the fears inherent in the onset of old age. It benefits from a strong orchestral backing and some lovely harp playing. <br />  <br /> The dramatic, climactic piece The King Must Die brings the album to a resounding conclusion.  <br />  <br /> Newer CD re-releases have bonus songs taken from Elton's treasure trove of great recordings from the year 1970, namely the original version of Grey Seal, the non-hit single Rock And Roll Madonna, and its B-side Bad Side Of The Moon. <br />  <br /> This is a definite 5-star recording, and one of my five all-time favourite albums. Essential .
B00005RERU|4.0|If you have been reading the reviews of this DVD, you no doubt have noticed the complaints about the DVD transfer. There are approximately 10 &quot;production&quot; houses that market this movie, all claiming Digital Gold Collection, Digital Remastered. I bought both the Alpha Studios (ASIN B00005RERU) and the Unicorn (ASIN B00005UM42). The Alpha release is the worst transfer I have ever seen. To borrow a great line from the movie &quot;Don't be doin' her like that. &quot; Total grainy 8mm projector quality. The worst. <br />  <br /> The Unicorn release is much better, very near typical DVD video quality. The picture on the case has only a close-up of a scowling Brando wearing a sombero with half of his face shaded (ala One Eyed Jack). <br />  <br /> The movie itself is on a level with Shane, Red River, The Man who Shot Liberty Valence, and Nevada Smith....although I hesitate comparing any Western or any movie to Shane. Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Karl Malden, Pina, Katy, Marlon Brando.....It doesn't get much better than this. <br />  <br /> I really can't add any details of the movie, out of respect to those who have yet to see it. Great story, Great cast, Great location, and absolutely GREAT lines.  <br />  <br /> Deserves 5 stars , but the quality of the Alpha print is so bad, it detracts from the character, mood, and atmosphere of the movie. GO FOR THE UNICORN RELEASE ON AMAZON.  <br />  <br />  <br /> Mysterious DVD release...10 studios marketing a classic movie so cheaply, with only a few, perhaps one, studios approaching even typical video quality.
0385336810|4.0|As I started this book, I thought it was another one of those &quot;Bridget Jones type girl whose life is lame but gets the man anyway&quot; books. In some ways, it was because she was annoyingly lame at first, but after 10 pages, she was endearing and I was really rooting for her. I even cried when she had a row with Jack! HA-I never cry at books! It was a great light and funny read. Very LOL (Laugh Out Loud). I can't wait to read the Shopaholic books now.
B00004RJ74|5.0|...read this review. From Dusk Till Dawn is one of those films where the less you know about it the better, so I highly recommend that you just see it and make up your own mind about it. In that spirit, I'll simply say that if you (a) have enjoyed Robert Rodriguez's and Quentin Tarantino's other work, (b) like suprises, and (c) have a fondness for genre films, you'll probably love this.        PS The DVD's great, too. See it on a system with 5.1 surround sound if you can. :)        Rating:    Film: 5 stars    DVD: 5 stars
B00023BLXK|4.0|On hot summer evenings, when deep drama just won't do, then try this little film DIRTY DANCING: HAVANA NIGHTS for a languid pleasure.  Diego Luna and Romola Garai make a terrific couple and both have enough stature to bring this little soap opera up to higher aspirations.  Set against the end of Batista's rule over Cuba and the rise of Castro, the background of Cuban exoticism adds to this coming together of a Cuban lad and an American lass on the dance floors of Cuban nightclubs and eventual Latin Dancing competition.  The story may be slight, but the cast is genuine and endearing and there is plenty of very beautiful and sensuous dancing to brighten up the plot.  Worth your time for that laid back summer evening.
B00008EY65|4.0|if you've seen 'the league of extraordinary gentlemen' and consider it's a too bad movie like what i thought, then you're gonna enjoy this cool movie quite a bit. this is a quite fun movie even it's cliched a lot. still worth watching. don't think it too deep, then you'd be fine.
B00000I5Y6|4.0|I was in high school when Kansas' first LP hit the stores. (Yes, this was during the dinosaur days of vinyl.) Kansas was HUGE among my friends. They performed several times at the local university. I owned every Kansas LP from the first right through Point of Know Return - what I consider the true meat of the Kansas catalog.<br /><br /> This CD &quot;best of&quot; concentrates on the &quot;hits,&quot; but gives a nice glimpse at the prog-rock songs like Song For America and The Pinnacle. I wish there was something from the first record, which is mostly prog-rock.<br /><br /> Kansas has always been a band that is hard to pin down. Rock, prog-rock, pop, and blues were all part of their sound. Kansas belongs in the pantheon of bands like Styx, Bob Seger, REO Speedwagon, Journey, and Boston that provided the soundtrack for many a high school party in the 70s. It's nice to listen to them once in a while, and this CD does justice to Kansas.
B00005NOOH|5.0|As a young kid I would set aside each Monday night for Monday Night Baseball and each Tuesday night to watch \\"The World At War\\" on PBS. I was rivited to the set. I learned about World War II from this wonderful series. I just could not say enough good things about it. I was worried since many things that seemed wonderful as a child don't hold up as an adult, but this did. It's great!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|These aren't the original movies, but instead are the &quot;special editions&quot; with Greedo shooting and Jabba flopping around in the first movie. Also, it's not &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope,&quot; it's title is &quot;Star Wars.&quot; <br />  <br /> I will not be purchasing these movies until they are released as they originally appeared in theaters.

B0001FR3IQ|2.0|This was a different type of role from Berry's other films.  Maybe she's attempting everything to keep from being typecasted.  Well, I liked the movie for what it was worth...passing time on a rainy day.  This movie held my interest but I guess the bad guy too soon and I was right.  Just remember when something is too obvious, it's not real or it's not the bad buy.  Rent this, please don't buy it.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|I can't comment on the newer format, but I bought this album when it first came out and listen to it frequently. I think this is one of the most musical of Dylan's recent albums, yet it still has great lyrics too. The last track, &quot;Sugar Baby' always meaks me think of &quot;Old Man River&quot; from Showboat for some reason. My two favorite songs are &quot;High Water&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Day Blues,&quot; but i can listen to the entire album easlily. As much as I enjoy &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; &quot;Love and Theft&quot; has more variety, especially musically. I can't wait for the next new Dylan album.
B00009XITP|5.0|The first time my college roommate suggested we watch &quot;What A Girl Wants&quot;, I thought she was crazy. After listening to the plot, I was skeptical - this &quot;modern-day Cinderella story&quot; seemed a bit too cheesy to be entertaining. Delightedly, I found it to be quite the opposite. While it will never make AFI's list of Greatest Movies, &quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; is a feel-good bit of fun.  <br />  <br /> Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) is the favored political candidate in an upcoming House of Commons election. Serious, charming, and intelligent, Dashwood is the impeccable Englishman, with a London estate, a beautiful finacee, and a brilliant political career ahead of him. That is, until a 17-year old New York teenager named Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) arrives on his doorstep claiming to be the daughter he never knew existed.  <br />  <br /> Daphne has long held a dream of developing a relationship with her long-lost father, and despite his initial reservations, Henry quickly falls in love with his daughter. However, the two are worlds apart. His life is one of garden parties and balls based on lineage and aristocracy; she is an energetic, vintage American teen. And though Henry used to be a loose canon himself, he finds that he must convince his daughter to change so that she can be accepted into his world. <br />  <br /> Though the film does feature the &quot;wicked stepmother and evil stepsister&quot;, it is mainly about the relationship between father and daughter and the importance of being true to oneself. With an all-star cast, including Bynes, Firth, Kelly Preston, and Jonathan Pryce, &quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; is more than mere fluff-it is a feel-good film with a fun plot and a bit of magic. It is, after all, a modern-day fairy tale.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I owe Alica and apology. I so much didn't wanna like this album. I was kinda burned out on her after all the hype and how overplayed &quot;Fallin&quot; and &quot;A Woman's Worth&quot; were. When I heard &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot; i began to suspect I was wrong about her. Then came &quot;If I Aint Got You&quot;, that song is just plane amazing. I then saw the Ladie's First tour, and Alicia won me over that night. I am a fan for life. I'll be representing for her from now on. She truly commanded attention in an audiance that was there more for Beyonce than her and that takes work. The song &quot;Diary&quot; is beginning to make an impact at radio and will for sure become a hit, its a great song too. Way to go Alicia, and please forgive me for prejuding you.
B0000399WI|5.0|I wanted to let anybody know that a new, 2-disc platinum edition of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; will become available in October 2004. However, it is possible to purchase and reserve a copy now on Amazon.com.
0767802470|5.0|I love DAS BOOT, in part, because it's a very different sort of war film. It doesn't seek to glamorize war, as most other war films do. Instead, it piles turmoil upon turmoil, stressing its characters to their very limits. This is a film that's not afraid to show the pure, relentless torture of war, its extreme emotional strain and the desperate struggle just to stay alive. <br />  <br /> At three and one-half hours, the Director's Cut of DAS BOOT is quite long (although it's so good it doesn't seem that long), but if you're looking for quality in filmmaking and top performances from all the actors, you really can't go wrong with DAS BOOT.  <br />  <br /> The best performance, by far, in my opinion, is turned in by Juergen Prochnow as the Captain. Prochnow certainly knows that &quot;less is more.&quot; Although DAS BOOT can, at times, be a melodramatic film, Prochnow never overacts. He says more with a facial expression, a gesture, or the look in his eyes that with overt actions. <br />  <br /> DAS BOOT centers on one German U-boat's mission and its struggles. We see the young recruits reporting for duty strong and healthy and, over the course of the film, we watch them deteriorate into mental and physical wrecks and, given all they go through, we're not at all surprised that they do. <br />  <br /> Almost all of DAS BOOT is filmed inside the cramped submarine and one of the tensest scenes occurs when the U-boat is forced to dive deeper than it should. It should go without saying (but I will say it anyway), that this is a very, very claustrophobic film, not only because of the cramped, nearly airless quarters in the submarine, but also because of the weight of the water that's constantly threatening it. <br />  <br /> DAS BOOT is definitely not a political war film and I loved that. It doesn't dehumanize Nazi Germany and glorify the Allied Forces. We see both as terrified human beings just trying their best to survive. Juergen Prochnow is not a politically driven captain; his sympathies are with his men, not with the Reich. <br />  <br /> One of the film's most revealing scenes occurs when the U-boat sinks a freighter. The German crew doesn't celebrate this as a victory; instead they watch with horror as their enemies die. I found this a chilling scene and one that really brought home the horrors of war. <br />  <br /> Anyone who likes the shorter version of DAS BOOT is going to find the Director's Cut a joy and will definitely want to own it. The characterization is richer and more complex, adding to the film's overall quality. For those who haven't seen the film, one warning: while this is quality filmmaking at its finest, it is certainly as grim and gritty as it gets. With that caveat, I would recommend this film to almost anyone. <br />
B00005JLEX|5.0|Just saw Jerry Seinfeld in concert and he personnally announced Nov. 23rd as the release date for the DVD.  He also said that the whole series would be packaged together.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I love this movie! The dancing is great, the music is great, and the plot is great. It's about Katie who moves to Cuba with her parents and then she meets Javier who works at the hotel she's staying at. But then she by mistake gets him fired, so to make it up to him, she convinces him to enter a dance contest with her. The grand prize being $5,000 and going to America. I think this movie is definately as good as (if not better) than the first Dirty Dancing.
B000286S8S|5.0|This is a great cd of the Dave era and Sammy era.While I am more a fan of Hagar I like the stuff with Dave also.Great mixing of the songs.It's stupid how most Greatest Hits have songs in order of release.I also like the 3 live songs at the end.In my opinion,Sammy does a better job on Jump and Panama.I would love to see them re-record those two with Sammy on vocals.Much better than that so called Best of Vol.1.Again,GREAT cd guys!The new songs kick a**!Especially Up for Breakfast and Learning to see.
B000286S8S|3.0|Sammy has put out a number of post-VH albums, most of which were excellent ('Marching to Mars' at the top of the list, IMHO), if not at the very least, decent. So, I'm reasonably clear in the thought that Sammy still has 'it'. <br />  <br /> And FWIW, Van Halen III never sounded like Gary Cherone had joined Van Halen. VH III sounded like Eddie was the new guitar player for Extreme. <br />  <br /> But I digress. After a decade and four spectacular studio albums proved that Sammy & Eddie had a musical cohesiveness that surpassed even David Lee Roth's showmanship & penchant for cover tunes, I am extremely disappointed that after nearly a decade apart, these three weak excuses for Van Halen songs. And it's not even like they're part of a whole new album. Wait...didn't they already release a greatest hits album? <br />  <br /> Don't get me wrong. I've grown up with Van Halen and loved their music. I consider Van Halen to be my favorite band of all time. And when Sammy joined the band, to me, they became the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of Rock & Roll (my favorite male vocalist together with my favorite band) But with this latest offering I'm left recalling the opening dialog of &quot;Inside&quot; from '5150':  <br />  <br /> &quot;Hey! What kind of crap is this?! I dunno. I thought it was really gonna be different this time!&quot;
B000002U8G|5.0|This is my all time favorite Pink Floyd album. In my opinion this album is very underated. The first song is about ten minutes long and it is very experimentel and exciting. The second song is not my favorite song but it is a good quality Pink Floyd song. The third song Fearless is one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs it is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head and inspires you to do something great. The fourth song San Tropez is a very smooth jazzy song that should be a classic Pink Floyd song but is virtually unknown. The lyrics make you want to sing along with it. The fifth song Seamus is a folksy song that is accompinied by barking dogs in the background and shows the band members dry sence of humor. But the real masterpiece on Meddle is the twenty-three minite long song Echoes. It is my all time favorite Pink Floyd song, it is so buetiful in a extreemely depressing sort of way. I strongly recomend you buy this album I promise you will get your moneys' worth out of it.
B0000024K1|5.0|Congratulations Remy - you're reviews are the final word in irony. Loved the Avril Lavigne hatchet job too - good to see you picking the difficult targets. Are you a student by any chance?
B00003CXB7|5.0|If you are only familiar with the TV version of M.A.S.H. you will find the film very different, but very funny. Donald Sutherland (Hawkeye) and Elliot Gould (Trapper) are both brilliant as the crazy surgeons trying to keep sane among the chaos of war. The tone of the film is wilder than in the TV series, of the original movie cast only Gargy Burghoff (Radar) went on to star in the Tv version. These days I find I prefer Donald Sutherland's Hawkeye, Alan Alda's unrelenting niceness gets on my nerves a bit. In the film version there are two other surgeons who share Trapper and Hawkeye's anarchic activities, Duke Forrest and Spearchucker Jones (you will recall there was a halfhearted attempt to make Spearchucker a regular character in the early TV episodes, but he soon faded from view). I love the bit in the movie when Duke, a southerner is told they are going to be sharing their accomodation with a black surgeon and he remarks plaintively &quot;It's bad enough having to share with you two Yankees&quot;. Uptight army nurse Margaret Houlihan is subjected to much rougher treatment than she gets on TV, as in the scene where her all is exposed when the doctors cause the shower to collapse while she's using it, in order to settle an argument over whether she is a natural blonde or not. Then there's the grand climatic football match, where some very dirty tactics are brought into play to make sure the M.A.S.H. team win. Dirtier, edgier and more cynical than the TV series, this is a very different M.A.S.H., but in some ways it's even better.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is one of those movies that reminds one of the power of film. Director Paul Thomas Anderson masterfully weaves together the stories of several people, all interrelated, into one brilliantly orchestrated work. Every aspect of Magnolia adds tremendously to its ultimate design, from the cinematography to the music to the flawless cast. <br /> <br />The plot is difficult to pinpoint, especially since the film consists of several different stories. Don't watch this movie for the plot so much as for the themes, all of them poignantly addressed, and the characters. I found most of them less than sympathetic, but this is beside the point. Each one is arriving at some sort of break-down. The movie essentially analyzes their descent, their attempts to pull themselves out, and their ultimate recovery, although this pattern varies from person to person. <br /> <br />All the performances are right-on, but the best, in my view, come from Melora Walters, Julianne Moore, and Jeremy Blackman. Aimee Mann's songs also add further dimension. All-in-all, I give Magnolia my highest rating and recommendation. It is bold and beautiful. See this film.
B00005JY1B|5.0|OK, admittedly the plot of this movie is implausable, unlikely and unbelievable. But, if you are either a Keanu Reeves fan, a Charlize Theron fan or a San Francisco fan it is worth watching. The city is lovingly photographed and it is a joy to watch the colors and hills of S.F. unfold along with the (corny, sappy) story. I've lived in the area of the films final sequence (just above Dolores Park) and can attest that the film is successful in capturing the essence and heart of both the Mission and Potrero Hill districts of the city. <br />Charlize Theron has since proved to be an A-list actress, and Keanu Reeves is so good looking it's a pleasure to watch him in anything. If you are in the mood for a getaway to the light and color of San Fran, and maybe shed a tear or two, this movie is just the ticket.
B00004U8JV|4.0|&quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; is based on the novel by Michael Crichton, but that would only be part of the novel &quot;The Lost World&quot; because most of it ends up in &quot;Jurassic Park III.&quot; In a lot of ways this film is actually closer to Arthur Conan Doyle's version of &quot;The Lost World,&quot; where humans enter a prehistoric world, whilce Crichton's purpose was to look at the dark side of Walt Disney. But all this really means is that neither movie is the original &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; and given that standard any sequel is going to be disappointing.<br /><br /> The story is that Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the chaos mathematician and Cassandra of the first film, is back amongst the dinosaurs even though he does not want to be. But his girlfriend, Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on Island B and so Ian is off to the rescue. The idea is that in addition to the island with Jurassic Park on it John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) had a second island, Isla Sorna, where dinosaurs were also being bred and allowed to run around with even more liberty (to wit, no electrical fences or any other barriers). So Ian joins Sarah, nature photographer Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), gadget expert Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff), and to everyone's surprise, Ian's daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester).<br /><br /> The group has enough problems when they make the mistake of rescuing a baby T-Rex with a broken leg, but then Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) shows up with legendary big game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlehwaite) and his merry men. Ludlow wants to round up some dinosaurs to take back to the San Diego Zoo while Tembo wants the chance of a lifetime to hunt and bag a T-Rex buck. Malcolm keeps warning everybody that death and screaming is the inevitable result of fooling around with Mother Nature when it comes to bio-genetically engineered dinosaurs, but if anybody listened to him where would the fun be?<br /><br /> For me the reference point is the T-Rex attack sequence in &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; which I think is, from a cinematic standpoint, the best in director Stephen Spielberg's career. Anything that happens in a dinosaur movie, whether it is by Spielberg or anybody else, gets judged against the standard of that sequence. I still have a vivid memory of sitting in the theater at the first midnight showing of the film watching that sequence and thinking it would terrify my son, who was still in grade school, and how would I ever explain to him that he could not see this movie? (He saw the movie, I got him a neon bedspread that we still have, and he wants to be a military historian, so it turned out okay). The bottom line with &quot;The Lost World&quot; is that there is nothing like that here.<br /><br /> The best sequence in the film is actually somewhat tangential to the dinosaurs, having to do with a vehicle on the side of a cliff. There is also a very effective shot of a group of velociraptors moving through the high grass to start picking off the harried survivors. But if we are talking about anything as terrifying as that original T-Rex attack sequences, then there is nothing close. For that matter we are, for the most part, missing the sense of shock and awe over the presence of real, living, and breathing, dinosaurs that you can see and touch. The first time we see dinosaurs in this film, a family of stegosaurs, is not even close to that same moment in the first film. But then most of the characters in the film treat the dinosaurs like commodities or special effects. The only two characters who really seem like they are interacting with real dinosaurs are Sarah and Tembo, although their positions on the beasties are polar opposites. It could simply be because Moore and Postlehwaite are the two best actors in the film, each working to make potentially stereotypical characters (damsel in distress, big game hunter) into something more realistic. Goldblum is still too much of the anti-hero to be an action star, but fortunately the film does not try to make him into one.<br /><br /> &quot;The Lost World&quot; is still enjoyable because it is still Spielberg on the other side of the camera running the show and even while there are comic moments he does not back off from the fact that these animals are more than willing to gobble up people (sometimes he combines the comedy and eating as with the dog in the backyard who has to guard the house against a T-Rex). Spielberg made the movie because of the final sequence, which gets a dinosaur off the island and back to California for some mayhem in the streets and if the film was going to bump up to the next level that was where it gets to happen, but the end result is pretty pedestrian (actually, lots of pedestrians, as well as people in cars and buses). Still, it is a Stephen Spielberg dinosaur movie, which is not a bad way to spend an evening in the safety of your own home.dblum is still too much of the anti-hero to be an action star, but fortunately the film does not try to make him into one.  <br />  <br /> &quot;The Lost World&quot; is still enjoyable because it is still Spielberg on the other side of the camera running the show and even while there are comic moments he does not back off from the fact that these animals are more than willing to gobble up people (sometimes he combines the comedy and eating as with the dog in the backyard who has to guard the house against a T-Rex).

6305907145|4.0|The first and foremost criticism you will hear for this film is that it does not slavishly follow Jane Austen's original novel. This is, in fact, true. For one, certain political issues (slavery) are brought to the forefront in a perhaps heavy-handed way that would constitute my only personal detraction from the film's worth. Certain plot elements are edited: in the novel, the preparations for the play that is abruptly cancelled take up a significant amount of text. And certain characters are much changed in manner and motivation, but more on that later.<br /><br /> Despite these liberties taken with the original, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; remains a superbly enjoyable film with the spirit of Austen intact, if not the letter or the law. Her heroine, Fanny Price, still has the same spirit and sensibilities that she was written to have, and her story -- that of a poor girl sent to live with her wealthy relatives, subsequently falling in love with her cousin Edmund -- is as fraught with emotion and upheaval as ever. A plot element I find especially keen is the downfall of Edmund's sister Mariah after her infidelity; Austen leaves no hope for Mariah's recovery here, whereas in &quot;Pride & Prejudice&quot;, Lydia Bennett's living in sin with a dashing young officer who is forced to marry her is swept somewhat under the carpet. A side note, definitely, but an interesting contrast.<br /><br /> Returning to &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, the character that undergoes the most startling transformation in this film adaptation is Henry Crawford, brother of Mary; both are enterprising and manipulative sophisticates intent on infiltrating the Betram family. In the novel, and in other previous film versions, Henry and Mary are an entirely matched pair -- both self-involved and self-serving. Here, Mary retains a black widow-type predatory slant, but Henry is given a new depth. He begins as the worst of playboys, chasing after Mariah Betram before (and after, as it turns out) her marriage, but here hsi pursuit of Fanny turns serious. He truly seems to fall in love with her, or at least in love with the man he could become if he were with her, which is in fact the most profound possibility of all. When Fanny briefly accepts his marriage proposal, we understand why, because his feelings do appear to be sincere; when she calls the engagement off, however, we see the inevitably of this decision, even barring her love for Edmund. Fanny might have &quot;been the making&quot; of this Henry, for there seems to be some hope for his sincerity. When he reverts to his immoral ways, however, after her rejection, we, along with Fanny, accept the sad truth that his transformation was only skin deep. This entire character exploration of Henry Crawford is not contained in the original novel, but (though many purist Austen fans will disagree) the film is the better for it.r marriage, but here hsi pursuit of Fanny turns serious.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie was excellent for a reason: it had a compelling message that has not been properly discussed in past sci-fi movies. While Back to the Future certainly dealt at length with the issue of changing &quot;future&quot; history by changing events in the past, The Butterfly Effect, showed that even small changes made in the past can change our destiny for better or worse.<br /><br /> Probably everyone has thought through at some point in their life whether their life would be different if they had made that stock investment in that Fortune 500 company, married their high school sweetheart, or bought that second home when prices seemed &quot;unreasonable.&quot;<br /><br /> I liked this movie a lot because it actually encourages its audience to think through the small decissions they make in their life that may have long-term ramifications. Taking this movie seriously may encourage someone to abstain from driving if they had been drinking. Imagine the ramifications of drinking and driving: one is changing the future for multiple individuals, mostly for the worse. I loved the movie. The alternative director's edition ending is a bit too depressing, so I'd advise most moviegoers not to see it.<br /><br /> Michael
B0000028UK|5.0|There are few things that come along that always seem to be good, no matter what your frame of mind. PJ's Vs. is one of these albums. From the opening lines of 'Go' this one demands your attention. I have owned this on CD since it came out in 1993 and it has rarely left my rotation. Having seen PJ 5 times now, I also know that these songs form the backbone of a live performance that few modern bands can match.  <br /> <br />My personal favs are 'Blood,' 'Glorified G,' and 'Rearviewmirror.' Blood is just such a good hard/funky song, it always reminds me of my first concert and subsequent Mosh pit. I saw them at what you could call the height of their popularity back in 1996, at Merriweather Post, and this was one of the last songs of the show. Watching them jam this song out, it felt like 10 minutes, just captured the spirit of live music. Call it life changing. Glorified G is just a good song man. Good song. And Rearviewmirror is a driving anthem. Tell me you won't drive faster when that was on your cd player.  <br /> <br />The weakest link is probably 'WMA' but that is still catchy in a hypnotic sort of way. You kind of lose track of yourself listening to that one and move on to thinking about different things. This is a must have album, and if you don't have it I won't talk to you. I actually broke up with a girl because Daughter came on the radio and she couldn't identify the band. It's that good.
0783114222|4.0|I am a space fan. I have waited years to purchase this, and I'm finally glad I did.   The series start with Kennedy telling the American people how we're to conquer the mooon before the Russians do, and it sort of becomes a race for space walking.   The special effects used were great, very detailed and realistic. All \\"moon\\" missions were in my opinion, very close to the original events, very realistic looking too. The pace of the series was very good, and fluent within the same disc.  It's quite an interesting series, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to experience something new.

Not to mention berts ear shattering screams that complement all the songs so well! Also, the band got me through a lot of sh*t with this album so just wanna thank em! Best form of pain relief you can buy! You will definately like this if u like finch, story of the year etc! A must own album if ur into ur 'screamo'! If ur not into screamo but like bands like three days grace, taking back sunday, and inme u still might like this if screamin dont bug u too much! Also for big fans of the used who may want somethin heavier, give 36 crazyfists a try (preferably the second album). They have a heavier sound in general, similar style to 'say days ago' or 'pieces mended'! Kinda like the used crossed with killswitch engage. Also big recomendation!!!!!!!!!!! A band called InMemory!! Yet again similar to the used and finch. Their ep aint available on amazon as they are really small but they have four top tracks on their website!! ([...]
B00004ZBLD|5.0|Antonio Vivaldi, not only wrote wonderful concerti but also he wrote several vocal works, as master of the chorus of L'ospedale della Pieta for orphan girls. This oratorio is the only we have of the four he wrote. And it is a pleasure listening it. <br />  <br /> Though the theme of Judith, the heroine who saved Betulia from Holofernes has been depicted in several compositions, like Betulia Liberata by Mozart. The vision Vivaldi has of the whole scene is more about the seduction of Holofernes than the religious aspects of the theme. A seduction that appears in all its glory in the aria &quot;veni veni me sequere fide&quot;. <br />  <br /> Although I was used to the version recorded by the King's Consort with Ann Murray I was impressed by Kozena. She has a great elegance singing and , after listening her carefully I think she is my new favourite. Her voice has personality but never shadows the rol she sings. <br />  <br /> It is really a wonderful new recording and I recommend it for those who love classical music, and even to those who do not like Vivaldi.
B00005JMYG|4.0|Will Ferrell's star is on the rise. With hits like &quot;Elf&quot;, &quot;Old School&quot;, and now &quot;Anchorman&quot; under his belt he seems to have made a life for himself beyond &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, the number one news anchor in San Diego in the 1970s, who is somewhat of a living legend in the area. He is the face that everyone looks to for the news. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), a woman with high aspitations, and a determination that set off a war between herself and Burgundy. She wasnt to be an anchor, and he does not see how a woman can do what he does. When fate steps in, and Bergundy finds himself late for a broadcast, he finds his world turned upside down as Corningstone fills in for him...and does well.<br /><br /> &quot;Anchorman&quot; is a very satirical look at the news world of the 1970s as women are trying to break into a man's game. Will Ferrell disappears into Ron Burgundy, and carries the movie completely. The supporting case (along with a few surprise cameos) lend their own quirkyness to the supporting characters. If the previews looked funny to you, you will enjoy this movie. There are plenty more laughs to be found...and be sure to stay through the credits!
0312995423|4.0|Having read all of Brown?s books I can say that he has one constant, plots that are over the top and just barely believable. Think The X-Files without the supernatural and extraterrestrial. Digital Fortress is no different with Brown using a classic thriller formula: the average Joe thrown into the role of hunted spy/commando.  <br />  <br />All of the characters were corny, in my opinion. Very little depth. And the ending was a little bit too unbelievable, too trite. A dramatic countdown with everything worked out, just like an A-Team episode. I had the whole book figured out by Chapter 5, every twist, every turn. Not too challenging.   <br /> <br />That said, I could not put the book down because one, I wanted to see how Brown was going to tell this story and two, because Brown really has a great, captivating writing style. It just goes to prove that a good book is one that is enjoyable, not just complicated and unpredictable. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone. The plot is soooo simple, easy to figure out, but it is still a great read. <br /> <br />For more details, go to [...] Thanks. <br />
0684852764|5.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, The Beautiful and Damned is a tour-de-force of despair....but don't let that stop you from reading it.  <br /> <br />What begins as a sweet and involving love story quickly spirals downward into the depths of alcoholic misery.... <br /> <br />If ever there were two people in need of a good AA meeting, it's Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert. Meeting as teens by a mutual friend/cousin, Anthony is immediately taken, as are most boys who cross her path, with the beautiful Gloria. Fervently pursuing her, he becomes despondent when she eventually rebuffs his overtures, as she does with all her suitors. But Anthony perseveres, and discovers the truth, that Gloria is indeed in love with him. They marry, with all the best wishes of their friends and family. <br /> <br />Too tidy, of course, as this is where life takes some very unfortunate turns for the happy couple... <br /> <br />Anthony comes from a background of early 20th century privilege...having been raised by his wealthy Grandfather. Subsisting on a more than generous allotment while in school, Anthony receives one of the best educations that can be afforded to a person. Gloria, groomed and poised, is the perfect debutante....flirty, but never overly so...dignified, but not above an occasional drinking binge, and the object of many a boys' affections. <br /> <br />The ongoing party that envelopes the Patch's and their friends becomes a way of life for Anthony and Gloria, and their all-encompassing love becomes a nightmare of co-dependency and over-indulgence. Relying on Anthony's cache of bonds as income, when they continually overspend on their endless nightlife...neither ever engages in a worthwhile profession. Their love of one another turns bitter, resentful, passive-aggressive, and abusive, as they lavish affection on the bottle more and more. <br /> <br />Three quarters of this book reads like an AA sponsor testimonial for 'how not to live'....and is very engrossing. A hoped-for inheritance that meets with delay after delay; a stint in the service, as America enters World War 1; an affair to forget; and an aborted attempt at a movie career highlight the downhill run of Anthony and Gloria Patch. <br /> <br />An excellent read. Frequently humorous, though covering many dark topics, well-realized in regards to characterization and continuity....The Beautiful and Damned is an excellent portrait in black of what a 'privileged life' can also be like.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|This is a true story about Michael Alig and the Club Kids that ruled the NYC scene of the 90s.  Until he brutally killed and disposed of a drug dealer in his apartment.  Gross, twisted, and sick!  But it has been made more fabulous to become a movie!<br /><br />PARTY MONSTER the movie is a great cast, stylishly shot, but ultimately a little hollow movie.  It was made by the gay couple who brought you brilliant documentaries such as THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE and ... well ... PARTY MONSTER THE SHOCKUMENTARY!  It's a fun ride, but if you want answers check into the documentary where you get to see the real people and their real clothes and such.<br /><br />Why oh why is everyone so convinced this is an 80s era movie?!?  It really happened in the late 80s, and early to mid 90s.  Alig probably never listened to TWO OF HEARTS or YOU SPIN ME ROUND.  I would peg his scene with much more KMFDM and Thrill Kill Kult.  I blame the soundtrack producers for this glaring error of eras!  NYC is always on the cutting edge - not too much into the retro thing unless it's a theme night.<br /><br />But the acting is very good.  MacCaulay Culkin and Seth Green do a fab and fine job playing egotistical scenesters who fall into their own darksides.  And a surprisingly great cameo by Marilyn Manson threatens to steal the movie! The cast is first rate -- Dylan McDermott, Mia Kirshner, Wilmer from 70s SHOW, and Diana Scarwid all give strong performances.  Not to mention indie power chicks Chloe Sevigny and Natasha Lyonne!<br /><br />Sort of a LESS THAN ZERO for the 90s if you will!  Except the big difference is instead of killing themselves these kids kill each other.  Well ... at least one drug dealer.  The movie gives the victim, Angel Menendez, short shrift.  He was brutally killed by Michael Alig and possibly a whole cross section of his posse! And that's the real horror.  That someone thought they were so cool that they could get away with murder.
6305897786|3.0|This film is well done but it takes on far too deep themes for what it is; a film noir.  This film does an excellent job of capturing detective film noir cliches, but because the mystery involves such grand ideas as satan coming to earth and good vs evil that the detective genre cannot do these themes justice.  We have an excellent cast filling out all the classic characters of film noir detecive intrigue.  There's Johnny Depp as Corso, the vice-ridden detective who ends up playing all sides to the middle.  There are a couple of femme fatales with their own agendas.  And there is the mysterious millionaire who hires the private dick to perform a seemingly simple task, but with an alterior motive.  If this was just a story about a grimy P.I. who plays a bunch of greedy schemers against each other and walks away with a fistfull of dollars it would have been fine, but he walks away with the power to summon the devil.  This movie never really deals with the dark ideas which its plot is based around, but that does not stop it from being amusing, it just never ends up as satisfying as 'Devil's Advocate', or 'The Exorcist'.

B000002L42|5.0|For all the detractors of this live show, from a musician's perspective, it was awesome. Fagen's arrangements are amazing and to plan this whole thing with a three-sax non-traditional horn lineup is even more astounding. It may be easy to play &quot;Reeling In the Years&quot; on a guitar --- maybe Becker wasn't high when he pulled out the Strat back then and cut the original track. Maybe he even got it right after a few takes. But LIVE, with saxes carrying that solo part --- flawlessly, I might add. That takes some real talent. And in the guitar key, I'm here to tell you, that takes some work to pull off. It's hell on the pinky finger to pull off G# that many times in succession. <br />  <br /> I thought the whole CD was a great testament to what was generally considered to be a very good studio band, but with transient personnel, they were not necessarily considered a good live performance band. This effort puts that theory to rest. If it dragged, it was from the horn break on &quot;Sign In Stranger&quot; -- but that was planned. I enjoyed &quot;Book Of Liars&quot; as it allowed Becker to actually sing --- Becker never sang. I always thought it was because he was so zoned into the guitar that he never thought of singing. Besides the definitive voice of Steely Dan (outside of Michael McDonald) was Donald Fagen. That straining almost in tune voice of his was pretty endearing -- he was Everyman, not professionally or classically trained, but singing just enough in tune to sound good for what he was playing. Sort of a raw Barry Manilow (and HE actually thinks he can sing). I'd have thought it was hard to pull off &quot;Aja&quot; live, but it was done very well. If I have a favorite tune on the CD, it would have to be &quot;Peg&quot;. The guitar work and the drive of the beat really define the song from the fluff of the 70s. Fagen and Becker took some great pains to put all these musicians together and it paid off with this live performance. <br />  <br /> I thought thequality of the recording was first rate, but if there's a criticism at all, it's the fact that you can't hear the crowd as much. The thing about live performance is that the crowd never stops keeping noise -- but the production quality was so high, and the quality of the equipment must have been top notch as well -- so there is only hushed crowd noise. <br />  <br /> It's one of my favorite CDs for the pure pleasure of listening and relaxing to the nostalgic sounds of Steely Dan from their most productive period of music making. Buy this one without reservation, for the music itself. <br />  <br /> I think the critics of this CD were looking for something that wasn't there to begin with. Fagen and Becker stayed within the structure but arranged with enough imagination to keep the songs memorable on this CD.
0765310015|2.0|I wrote a review for this book that got wiped with all the other reviews, apparently.      However, upon rereading it, I decided that it didn't really get across what I was trying to say very well. I will give it another shot, for the love of fantasy.      Many times I find myself frustrated with reviewers because they evaluate a work with regard to some set of standards, never considering that the standards themselves might need reviewing. I find it much more helpful when a reviewer (book, movie, music, restaurant, or whatever) tries to give a sense of what he likes or dislikes about the book, so that a reader can decide how best to calibrate their response. For instance, if someone said that they love the shocking use of language in music, and that they really enjoyed the latest Roc-a-fella album because of its total disregard for the normal tolerance of obscenity, then the review would be helpful to me, because I would be able to calibrate my response accordingly.      So then.   Do you love Robert Jordan for his magnificent imagination and multitudes of characters involved in grand, sweeping plots filled with intrigue and power, both political and magical? Can you put up with his shallow characterizations, his stereotypical dialogue, and his irrational women?      These things are all present, and improved upon, in Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon. His imagination is fertile, his characters plentiful, engaged in plots of various purposes. Dark mages haunt the air; ancient creatures move and slumber under the earth. From this perspective, the book certainly competes with the stereotypical opening novel in Jordan's series.      Erikson's characters are also not plagued by the same puppet-on-a-string feeling that Jordan's characters can't shake. From the moment a Jordan character gets introduced, you feel that you can write the rest of their involvement in the story, and this only proves to be false when they act totally irrationally and unbelievably (Rand should be joining a group out in Salt Lake any day . . .). This isn't the problem with Erikson's characters. I don't know if I can pinpoint exactly what didn't grab me about them, but I will try.      Do you like George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire? Do you like the way you feel you have met each character? Seen their flaws and sympathized with them? This didn't happen to me with Erikson's characters. Sure, he was unconventional in many of the same ways as Martin; he didn't label characters good or evil; he kills off 'big people' left and right; the brutality of war isn't disguised. But, I didn't really care about most of them. There were opposing factions with people on both sides getting page time, but when they came in conflict I really didn't feel any tension. Some of them might have died, and I wouldn't have minded. However, when it came down to it, Erikson saved most of the major players. You know that feeling you get reading Martin, every time one of your favorite characters comes under the knife? You have no idea whether they will make it out or not, and you feel that tension down deep. Well, I never got that feeling reading this book.      Also, I didn't think the attempt at creating a 'lived-in world,' as Lucas would have said when he had vision, succeeded very well. In Tolkien, for instance, we know the elves are ancient, wise, and majestic, because they are. Here, we know the characters are ancient, inscrutable, and powerful, because Erikson tells us so. That isn't to say I didn't ever enjoy the world. I felt, actually, that Erikson didn't know how to reveal it very well, and when he did I enjoyed it quite thoroughly.      Well, I hope this is better than the last review. If you don't care about all that stuff I said about Martin or Tolkien, or don't even know what I'm getting at, then you might enjoy this book. I would certainly recommend it over Jordan or anyone named Terry.    edit: All my quote marks were turned to question marks, for some reason.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Albert King has an incredible relaxed style that seems so unaffected. Stevie is obviously enamored with his hero as a player and a person. Listening to this rough, live session featuring these two legendary guitar players is reminiscent of Martin Scorcese's &quot;The Blues&quot; films where the great old African-American blues players were interviewed and played a few tunes on their back porches. It's laid back and refreshing. The choicest cuts are when Albert gives Stevie advice about music and life. My 12-year-old son, a budding blues player himself, was particularly taken by Albert's entreaty in cut 2 &quot;Old Times&quot;: <br /> &quot;There's a lot of guitar players out here. They just players. They play fast. They don't concentrate on no soul . . . but you got 'em both.&quot; <br />  <br /> Then Albert joins Stevie in what I think is one of his best renditions of &quot;Pride and Joy.&quot; <br />  <br /> One of the classic blues records that everyone who loves blues should own. Technically imperfect and beautifully flawed. This is what real music is.
0393307050|3.0|This book is an acquired taste. For the first hundred or so pages, I was quite critical of Mr. O'Brian's writing. He uses extensive nautical language to describe the rigging, sails and anatomy of the ships of the period. I would have enjoyed the challenge of learning these terms--but he never taught them. It was quite frustrating to read in one exchange the terms &quot;brace-pendants,&quot; &quot;yard-tackle pendants,&quot; &quot;tackle-hook,&quot; &quot;stop-cleat,&quot; and &quot;stuns'l-boom&quot; with no explanation at all. (Page 92 of the paperback edition.) However, the action of the book could be enjoyed, if one were willing to skim over the technical jargon while thinking, &quot;...and then they did something to turn the ship,&quot; or some such. Characters were well fleshed out and full of human imperfections, and Mr. O'Brian is not afraid to inflict serious harm and death to his characters. Overall, I would recommend the book, but only for those with extensive nautical experience or extensive patience. <br />
B00005JMYG|4.0|Will Ferrell is boldly going where no Saturday Night Live! performer has gone in years ? translated success from the small screen to the big screen! Not since Mike Myers made the move to feature films with Wayne?s World has Hollywood seen such a comedic performer such as Will Ferrell. It isn?t recent that Ferrell has been making appearances in feature films; in fact he made his feature film debut in the Mike Myers comedy, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Since then he has made feature roles and cameos in numerous comedies, none of which have made anything beyond a few million dollars of their production budgets. It wasn?t until 2003 when Ferrell appeared in two surprise smash-hits, Old School and Elf, and decided to leave Saturday Night Live! Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon. <br /> <br />As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn?t matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego?s top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron?s world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given ?female? oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego?s top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accuraterepresentation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today. <br /> <br />The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny ? it may not be gut-busting but it doesn?t come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy?s news world. It wasn?t that she doesn?t work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn?t as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependant on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn?t have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner?s Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material is more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell?s Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don?t live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone. <br /> <br />Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such as Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film?s main problems is that there isn?t anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn?t get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it does graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn?t what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn?t shown in the comedy. Remember the film?s trailer? Some of the trailer?s more entertaining moments don?t make into the film (?Well, I?m getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again? ? ?Fantastic!?) but according to the film?s director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn?t expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This movie sucked, why?, i'll tell you.  There was no action, the big explosion was fake but looked pretty cool, there was no drama because we knew nothing about the characters, the performances were good but couldnt save the rest of the film, there was too much smut including fat naked women, rape, a sex scene and more which was totaly unessescary and just furthered ruined an already bad film.  If only somebody else directed it maybe they could have made a good war drama, with a little chick crap, but not too much.  I give it a 2 out of a 10 for the performances and the explosion which could have been better, o well.
