B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a very nice game.  Challenging but not too challenging that you can't figure them out.  Love all the different ways to find items in the same scenes.  Would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
1451666179|5.0|What Allie does is surprising. She somehow combines being naive and deeply rational, taking anything we take for granted, and tearing it apart to see what's inside. She's always like a child looking at something for the first time. The results are hilarious and heartbreaking. Like an acrobat, pulling dangerous tricks with her mind, she goes to places we would be afraid to go, all for the sake of our entertainment. There is brutal sincerity, brutal analysis, and a very accurate description of what it's like to be pseudo-intelligent and supposedly self-aware animals crawling planet Earth. (SPOILER!!!!!: Are we really any different from Simple Dog? And isn't she much happier?)
0062209493|2.0|It is a great story but there was so much swearing I couldn't finish it so I am going to pass it on.
159420411X|5.0|This book is full of stories which should be interesting to everyone. At the same time, those stories should serve as cautionary tales to anyone in academia who is applying statistics which they don't entirely understand. If nothing else, this book should give people a good sense for what kinds of predictions have been historically reliable (e.g. weather), which ones haven't (e.g. economic), and how to determine how confident individuals really are in their own predictions.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|After seeing this film, I can understand why the critical reaction to it was largely mixed. However, for the life of me, I don't see why it got a worse reception than \\"Superman Returns\\". If you're looking for a Superman movie that avoids the mistakes of that film, you have definitely come to the right place - even if \\"Man of Steel\\" doesn't succeed on every level.<br /><br />Here's a rundown of the good and the bad. WARNING: some spoilers within, though I'll try to avoid revealing any major plot twists.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />The Effects: I can't say enough good things about this aspect of the film. This is the most truly alien take on Krypton we've seen in any Superman film yet. The harsh yet beautiful landscape, the intricate spaceships, the three-dimensional liquid metal displays...the entire opening sequence featuring Kal-El's home planet was truly jaw-dropping. The same level of quality holds for the scenes with Superman displaying his powers. Zack Snyder's more \\"violent\\" take on the hero's flying makes it look remarkably realistic. The visuals in this film never \\"pop\\" the viewer out of the story, they draw you in. Actually, if the FX were the only point in the movie's favor, I'd still say it was worth watching once just to see them. Fortunately, there's more.<br /><br />The Storyline: I was somewhat disappointed when I learned Lex Luthor would not be returning for this film (though his presence in the Man of Steel universe is acknowledged in a very subtle fashion). Fortunately, the plot manages quite well without him, focusing on Superman's alien heritage rather than humans trying to bring him down. The theme of the implications of discovering that an alien walks among us lies at the center of the story, and leads to some interesting conversations among the main characters. The new mythology established for Krypton is very clever, and makes some of the typical elements of Superman's origin more rational. Kryptonite is absent, which is a good thing, in my opinion. Another weakness of Superman from the comics is used to prevent him being completely undefeatable - namely, his reliance on yellow sun radiation. All together, the plot is very coherent, though the actual storytelling suffers at times, as I'll explain later on.<br /><br />The Main Character: The film's missteps aside, it did give us a worthy new version of the world's greatest superhero. Cavill nails the many faces of Clark Kent. Kansas farm boy, reluctant hero, alien visitor - he skillfully pulls off every aspect of the character...except perhaps for one, which may or may not disappoint the viewer. Clark Kent the bumbling reporter is not really featured here. I won't reveal exactly how the idea of Superman's dual identity plays out, but let's just say it's a bit more complicated than putting on a pair of glasses and magically deflecting suspicion. Also, in regard to a certain difficult decision Superman makes toward the end of the film - in context, it's made very clear that he had no other choice. That's not to say this scene was perfectly executed, but it definitely still belongs in the movie.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />The Pacing: This is Man of Steel's biggest flaw. Everything just happens too quickly. In the Batman films, we had time to breathe between fights and dramatic twists, thanks to scenes that helped flesh out the characters and make their journeys more believable. Despite MoS's two-and-a-half hour length, it feels like Snyder and Nolan were struggling to fit everything in that they wanted to show. The first half of the movie is so rapid-fire it feels surreal at times, and the second half is so congested with concrete-smashing fights that by the time I was done watching, I felt exhausted.<br /><br />The Storytelling: I'm all for innovation in this category, but Man of Steel would have benefited from a good old-fashioned linear storyline. Once the Krypton scenes are done, we start jumping haphazardly between Clark's childhood and his adulthood, then back again. It's enough to make you seasick. I got the feeling that Snyder was trying to reinvent the wheel here. He veered off in another direction just as we were about to see the classic \\"spaceship in the cornfield\\" scene - no doubt an attempt to subvert expectations - but it didn't actually improve the film at all. Yes, we've seen the Kents finding Clark a hundred times before, but honestly, I wouldn't have minded seeing it again. And Clark would have seemed more relatable if his childhood scenes had all taken place at the beginning, giving the audience a better perspective on the gradual changes in his motivations and personality.<br /><br />The Fights: This has been brought up many times before by other reviewers, but there really is too much property damage in Man of Steel. I realize that the locations in question were mostly abandoned, so the death toll from the actual battles was probably zero (not counting what Zod's evil plot probably did to a few unfortunate citizens of Metropolis), but I feel that there's still a problem here. Snyder was obviously trying to show the raw power of Superman and Zod by showing how much damage they did just by tripping over a piece of rebar (that's an exaggeration, but you get what I mean). However, after a while, you start to concentrate more on how many buildings are getting leveled than on who's winning the fight. It's distracting. You can't help but wonder, right in the middle of all the action, how Metropolis will ever recover from all this, and that takes your focus off the story itself.<br /><br />The Humor: Or rather, the lack thereof. Let's face it - cool as it may be, Superman's story isn't exactly \\"believable\\". You could picture a billionaire playboy using gadgets to fight crime in real life, but not an alien with incredible powers living secretly among humans. Some gentle mockery here and there would actually have helped the movie. Instead, every single element of the Superman tale is treated as deadly serious. There are only a handful of funny moments here, and while they work, there aren't nearly enough of them. A few more laughs would have done wonders for the Clark/Lois romance as well. Also, call me old-fashioned, but I feel that a Superman movie should be family-friendly. It's just in the nature of the character. Instead, there are far too many moments of profanity (not from Supes, but still) and a little too much PG-13 violence. It's mostly bloodless, but it could have been toned down without adversely affecting the story. Sorry, but the world doesn't need a gritter Superman.<br /><br />Amy Adams: Don't get me wrong, she's adorable, and she's a fantastic actress, but she brings nothing new to this role. I don't feel that she had no chemistry with Clark, but she lacked that feistiness that made previous Loises so enjoyable. The more subdued nature of her performance could, of course, be partly blamed on the lack of light-heartedness I mentioned. Erica Durance's Lois would have been asking why everyone was so glum. (I'm not a Smallville fan by any stretch, but she was amazing.)<br /><br />Michael Shannon: He's not a bad actor, but his Zod came across as more petulant than intimidating. It may sound silly, but a British accent would have done wonders here - possibly because that's what people commonly associate with Zod. Antje Traue's Faora is far more successful as a compelling villain, even if she doesn't get much development.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS: Man of Steel is an essentially good film with some elements of greatness, and I believe that it signals a new and better age for the character of Superman. I probably will want to watch it again someday, though I'm still glad I rented it instead of buying it sight unseen. Hence the three stars instead of four. It doesn't quite deserve the 56% it got on Rotten Tomatoes, but it suffers from some unwise directorial decisions, a couple of poorly cast roles, and and a paucity of wit and charm. I highly recommend watching it, but don't expect the Superman movie you've been hoping for since the Christopher Reeve era. Perhaps that day will come in time.ly serious.

B00BB22GQM|4.0|This is one of the better albums I've heard this year. It's easy to listen to (if a little bit sad), and multiple listens will ensure the lyrics go in. The lyrics are really interesting - they seem to alternate between remembering being alienated young people, and imagining being old and wise. The range of themes means that everyone will find something in this album to identify with. And even if the lyrics don't move you, the melodies will.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Wish they hadn't made it with so many rooms with untradeables ,  outside that, I'm addicted.  Especially the seasonal rooms. Just sayin... and thanks.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|I bought this after seeing Clark live in Denver. The live show was amazing - the guitar was featured prominently in every song, and you could see why people peg him as a successor to guitar greats like Clapton and BB King. Unfortunately, the album was very different from the live show. Although it's still solid musically, the guitar tends to take a back seat to the vocals and the rest of the band. It's still worth owning, but definitely not as daring or exciting as I had hoped.
0446310786|4.0|I have been dying to read this book for years!! I love this &#34;simple love story&#34; although the love story isn't really the main plot. It is filled with deep meanings and somehow still feels innocent.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this game.  Can't wait for more tweaks so I can move buildings! Fun gameplay though. I love that it's now on kindle.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I love mark twain!! This is a beautiful story, simply written. Full of adventure and fun. I remember reading it as a kid and I absolutely loved it then, and still do today.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|One of the most enjoyable books that I've read in a while.  Although it's simply written, the story was intriguing, beautiful and intensely funny.  Laughed out-loud more than once...really couldn't put this one down for a second.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Lots of fun and educational. Would recommend this for people with children. Plus, it's FREE! I very much enjoy it.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|THIS IS THE FIRST NOVEL THAT I've READ BY THIS AUTHOR, AND WILL LIKELY BE THE LAST. I WAS EXPECTING A MYSTERY/THRILLER NOVEL, AND ENDED UP WITH SOMETHING MORE AKIN TO AN OVERWROUGHT ROMANCE NOVEL.
B00006JKOL|5.0|And flute, too. I missed much of Jethro Tull in my earlier years, but I'm making up for it now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wondered how they could continue the series with the same level of suspense, and they didn't quite make it.  A good book, a fun read.  Not nearly as bloodthirsty as \\"The Hunger Games\\".  I'd recommend it to friends.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Wonderful production of Phantom. I purchased this as a gift and the recipient was well pleased. I highly recommend this product.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Twenty years of playing together it couldn't be anything but great and it is!  I saw the Ramones live dozens of time in the early eighties and you can hear their live rapped fire feel on a couple of songs.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|laughably bad... so disappointed. Was hoping for so much more... confused. Krypton is a mashup of Avatar and The Matrix with way too many subplots.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and has watched it over and over again. I find it entertaining myself. It's a cute movie and worth the purchase.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Boring antiquated script...awful watch.<br />The movie spent about 80% of the time in conversation after conversation (obviously to fill in the gap and make a longer movie due to lack of action ideas) and very little dedicated to action
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this, as being a kid. It is a fun game, and I never get bored playing it! And it is so realistic!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad Sugar Crush has finally made it to Kindle...It's bigger and easier on eyes compared to playing it on my cell...One critique, the purple candy is a little compared to my android cell...But still very addictive and fun...
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I read this in one day. couldn't stop myself lol. I am about to buy the next book now :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very challenging to my surprise. I'm on level 109 and stuck there for 5 days now. It's really a lot.of fun for young and old. Love it!!!! Just wish getting lives didn't take so long.
1455525839|3.0|I'm sorry to say I didn't enjoy this Pendergast book very much. To begin with, there was too much emphasis on the Corrie character. She doesn't seem to understand how much trouble she is letting herself into. She is  a character I couldn't feel any empathy for. Pendergast has to bail her out of going to jail. From there the main character seems to take a back seat for large portions of the book. That's not a good thing in my opinion. I also didn't like the so-called villain's demise. It seemed so weak and uneventful. This book wasn't as good as the previous release, Two Graves. Three stars because of the previous books. It probably should have been two stars.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Never had a Facebook account until I received my Kindle from my future son-in-law.Plans to use it this Sunday will be very important at my Daughter's Wedding, 11-17-2013'
B00AG51V8E|2.0|A Real Snoozer. Cavil is SO not able to carry this as the protagonist trying to save his family from terrorist kidnappers.  He delivers his lines like an amateur.  Bruce Willis is his CIA dad who is killed off in the first few minutes.  Duh.  I kept thinking Willis would reappear, undead, and ready to deliver some serious macho.  Nope.  He's dead.  Sigourney Weaver is supposedly a ruthless CIA turncoat but brings none of her former star power to this role.  I guess she and Willis are in this silly effort 'cause they need the moola.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have to admit back when I had my rocket baller alienware I do recall enjoying this game on Miniclip's website. Was ok then sept it never would actually save my progress like most probably would prefer. Now that its on my kindle fire its much easier to control plus data is actually saved. I highly recommend this app. Yes there are things ingame that can be bought to be unlocked but I'm quite sertain you'd prefer the better route which is play to unlockem all for free. Well free of spending more $.<br /><br />Till next time&hellip;end of line&hellip;
B007ZD17XO|3.0|Easy game to complete, would play similar games to this one. I would consider another game of similar nature or look.
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|Not much to say, really. It's Spinal Tap, isn't it? The one criticism that I have with this movie is that the parody is so close to reality that it loses some of the humor when you watch it from the vantage point of today.<br /><br />Smell the glove.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game but do not like the fact that it limits play and wants a purchase or link to social media to continue, sort of a penalty.
B008220D7S|5.0|Honestly if you aren't in your 40s or beyond, you just should not have watched this because I honestly believe a lot of the subtlety would be lost on you and in that loss is reflected your low ratings. In fact, I would say if you are not in your 40's now, you probably won't get it. There was a special time between say 1964 and 1974 that this movie was made for you. We grew up in a time where literally we didn't know if we would be here the next day because for all we knew, nuclear war was going to break out tomorrow. That was basically every day. In your 40s, you are at an age where you see, through unlearning what you were taught or talked into your whole life, that all the crap and pretense of how things are supposed to be somehow never really seem to get there or approach reality. This is one movie that makes me feel better when life just gets to be a little too absurd, ironic or critically sad. I can't tell you how many times I was laughing hysterically during this movie because it was real, actual and authentic.
B0074JODP8|5.0|He is so amazing!  Just saw him in concert this week and it was truly awesome - inspired me to watch this video again (and again) as well as purchase music from iTunes for my phone.  if you like blues guitar you will love Joe Bonamassa.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star trek into Darkness is an underrated movie to me. Great twists and acting throughout especially from some of the brand new faces to the big screen. Never was a Star trek fan and can say I have enjoyed both Star Trek movies.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Intriguing concept but the execution was a mess due to jumpy camera work and an often dark, cluttered picture.  Almost no character development and really wasted Brad Pitt.  I know now why the Amazon Instant Video charge was only $.99 for a \\"first-run movie\\", recently in theaters.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I really enjoyed Man of Steel, although I am not obsessed with Comic accuracy so maybe many might feel differently who loved Superman movies/comics Growing up.  This for me is a movies I can watch a few time so I believe it is worth buying.  To me they casted a great Superman and picked great actors for the other roles. It will be interesting to see what they do with Batman vs. Superman, not sure how them against each other will really work. Maybe an Ego war?
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|It has a romantic quality of growth and change for those who enjoy a romantic comedy that actually helps you to realize if you want to bad enough you can be better than you thought you even could be, if you allow yourself to when you care enough for someone other than yourself.
B005LAII80|5.0|I really enjoyed the Dredd re-make.  Underrated movie by many, still know so many people who haven't watched this movie.  If you like cop shows or action movies you will enjoy this movie.  Hoping for a Dredd 2 with the same leading actor.
B004SB60OC|5.0|There's a beauty in the raw fresh lyrics and the strong vocals that are on every track. The talent is there and can't wait to hear her next release.
B008220B0C|3.0|If you're expecting a lot of contiguous concert footage and music, this is not for you. There are occasional concert clips spliced into a lot of &#34;behind the scenes&#34; footage.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|I never purchased the original DVD, but had seen and recorded the additional tracks on VHS. Transfer here is very good, music up to Eric's usual fine instrumentation, and the variations between electric and acoustic versions are a nice change. I have read many criticisms of Eric lately, and I must say they are unfair. He has added his name and playing to many worthwhile charity concerts, and is the consummate team player, willing to share the spotlight with others. Watch how he interacts with the other players on this set and you get the idea that he realizes that the contributions of others lends value to work bearing his name. If you are not familiar with the additional tunes on this special set, I think you will agree that Eric is truly appreciative of the Blues, and we are all better for him sharing his talent with the world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks so much Amazon. I have been waiting for candy crush to come. I am hooked and my mom is undressed! It is a grate game for car trips, kids, and just extra time. I love the game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book flew by in a matter of hours! Perfect detail without bogging down. I truly came to care for the characters and could feel their conflict and struggle. Looking forward to the next book!!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|It is nearly impossible for me to NOT like Will Smith. However, he came really close this time.<br />It's a message movie and I like the message he's trying to pass on.<br />Next time, kindly take a moment to make me care about your characters and the story line as well.<br />I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just didn't make me FEEL much........ a point that good old Will RARELY misses on.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I can not even put this in words that's how awesome it is. Also great graphics :) Don't listen to bad reviews this is awesome for all ages!

0743289692|5.0|I have previously been a fan of Ayaan Hirsi Ali in her speeches and debates.  I myself as an atheist had much respect for her being an ex-Muslim women speaking out so harshly against Islam.  In one particular debate about whether or not Islam is a religion of peace, it was noted by the commentator that many turned down the opportunity to be on the debate, specifically because they were scared to challenge Ali.  This gave me the spark to learn more about her.<br /><br />But to my amazement, this book did two things.  First, it surprised me that it was NOT a wholly anti-religious book.  She writes of great things she did learn as a Muslim, and how much of her mother's terrible actions were out of a good heart.  Second, it really was a memoir of her upbringing, not about the more modern day Ali most only know... which was a great thing to learn about.<br /><br />Her story is absolutely stunning and amazing.  Being born in a 3rd world country during a civil war, then forced to live as a Muslim girl in Saudi Arabia, then live in the political unstable horribly environment of Kenya.  After all that while being shipped away as apart of an arranged marriage she manages to escape and seek asylum in the Netherlands.  Not only does she find her way into Dutch society, but she then goes on to earn a Master's Degree in Political Science from one of the Netherlands best universities.  Talk about a mind blowing journey.<br /><br />I am lost for words on how amazing and incredible this woman is.  No matter what your views on religion are, you will love this book.  Amazing story by an amazing woman.

B00062PN6I|4.0|I have owned these headphones for over 5 years.  Was in a large music/instrument store and the salesperson recommend these to me.  I had seen previous reviews on the headphones back then, instantly recognized them-- and went ahead and bought them.<br /><br />SOUND:<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent.  I also own Grados, a Sennheiser PXC 250, and a few higher-end earbuds.  Of course, earbuds and over the ear headphones are apples and oranges, I only mention this to give an idea that I've had experience with a number of different listening devices.<br /><br />The highs are crisp and pronounced, and the bass is present and punchy, yet not overpowering.  Not muffled in any way.  One thing that I noticed is that I heard things that I never heard before in my music.  Instruments, breaths, etc.  This was exponentially amplified when I put on a pair of Grado<br /><br />COMFORT:<br /><br />The headphones are comprised of plastic, with a one-way adjustable band that lengthens the circumference of the device. I found them to be not the most comfortable.  They didn't sit wrong or weird, just not as comfortable.  There is no adjustment of the earcups, these are just one injection-molded piece that lengthens to accommodate different-sized heads, but for comfort you will have to play with how you wear them on your head, and hope that your ears aren't pushed or squished by the earcups.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY:<br /><br />This is originally why I came to Amazon today: to see if others have my same issue.  All of a sudden, and all at once, the &#34;black stuff&#34; issue has appeared.  The covering on the earcups is crumbling. Literally.  And not crumbling in large chunks.  In small, tiny pieces that are flaking off.  There is plastic everywhere.  On me. The floor. The desk. Wherever I set them down.  Yech!<br /><br />What I've had to do is sit down for stretches of time and pull the rest of it off, otherwise this shedding would take a year or so to complete.  The design of the earcup is even that you can't pull it off totally: there are two &#34;sections&#34;.  Also, the design does not allow for replacement foam pads or covers.  So the disintegrating plastic skin that is going in my ears has been pulled off to reveal a nice, soft fabric.<br /><br />Also, this same plastic-skin coating is on the headband, so it will get in your hair.  The krinkly-ness of the headband makes it a royal expedition to try to peel off the coating.  Not good.<br /><br />This whole fabric piece comes off, however underneath is nothing but a hard flat plastic surface... not suitable for any kind of replacement foam earpads.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />I recommend these for the sound.<br /><br />I don't recommend them for the build quality and the comfort.<br /><br />Overall I'd give them a 3.5, because the sound quality is THAT good.<br /><br />Rather than deal with this it's just occurred to me to buy another pair for nine-ninety five.  If they last for another 5 years then that will be like $1 per year ownership: an EXCELLENT value for such high sound quality.<br /><br />Good luck with your pair!

It features a cute variety of canon ponies, as well as some well known background ones you can purchase.<br /><br />The annoying parts, however, include that sometimes quests appear after you finish the quest already, and gem prices. Though besides that, this includes many things that will surely entertain!<br /><br />Add me on Gameloft! WishLotus :) Thanks!
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|I have been a Motorhead fan for quite some time and always thought of Lemmy as the dad I should of had instead of Sgt. Joe Friday. I received this in the mail and immediately jumped into the 85 Camaro and started driving down Rt. 58. The album opens up kicking asphalt and I started digging this album right away. Well while driving I seen 3 chicks walking down the road. I slowed down and noticed a blonde, brunette, and a redhead (neapolitan?).  The blonde walks up and says &#34;Is that Motorhead?&#34; to which I replied &#34;Yep&#34;. Her and the other ladies than showed me that they were wearing Motorhead t-shirts. My eyes lit up as my 80's video dream fantasy started to come alive. They jumped into the Camaro and we sped away. The brunette kept claiming that Lemmy was her dad  but I doubted that since she looked nothing like him (Thank God). Well to make a long story short we jammed into the wee hours to Motorhead's latest effort and to them I say &#34;Thank You&#34; for making heavy metal the old fashioned way and to helping me live out my 80's video fantasy for this old Motorhead. As for them ladies I sure hope I see them the next time Lemmy and co. release a new album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun game.  Reminds me of my childhood. Very Mario meets absenth. I greatly recommend it for the weekend time waster
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I liked this movie because the elephant was chasing a flower because he heard  a tiny voice from the speck. It is also very funny.<br /><br />(Written by my granddaughter, Nikky.)
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I'm glad I wasn't swayed by the negative reviews (no offense to the critics of steel!).<br /><br />I watch different movies for different reasons. Growing up in Jamaica in the late-1970s and 1980s with a black-and-white box, then the first colour box in my neighbourhood, meant my house was movie central. The television station was 9 to 5 for most of my youth, and evolved to late night viewing on holidays. Rambo, Dirty Harry, Rocky, spaghetti westerns, and SUPERMAN were highlights of Christmas holidays. Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, and Christopher Reeve were family who came to visit on the holidays. We waited eagerly in front of the tube for them, were overjoyed when they arrived, and weeping when they left. The evolution of Superman over the years is a rite of passage along a mystical timeline for me. In 1978 I was still turning a knob to change a channel, and my dada was climbing on the roof in the rain to re-position the antenna. In 2013, I'm watching movies on demand, commercial-free, and online. From 1978 to 2013, Superman movies represent more than film production, acting, and criticisms; that's 35 years of entertaining all walks of life across the world, 35 years of technological advancement, 35 years of keeping the hope of mankind alive. Movies like Superman encouraged a little island girl to dream beyond boundaries, push the limits, and achieve beyond her imagination. The movie has come a long way since 1978, and so have I. I'm grateful for Superman, for the nostalgia, and the periodic reminder that we all wear that S on our chests.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|It was funny when the man and the bee were fighting.  Also, how they wore little jackets when they were collecting pollen from the flowers.<br /><br />(Written by Nikky, my graddaughter.)
B00DQQSD3G|4.0|I have the hardcover books of this series, which are great to flip through pictures of but actually sitting and reading the dense text in a volume that physically large is cumbersome at best.  Very glad the digital edition is here for easy tablet reading in bed, and don't regret owning both so I can flip through and look at the great pictures in the book yet still curl up and read the absolutely engrossing text. The video clips included are also pretty neat as well - short, but each one has it's own value (like the one on \\"Endor\\" when the director gives his direction, then George kind of re-gives it and pretty much ignores what the director said - it really reenforces points of the book).<br /><br />My reason for giving it five stars as opposed to four is because other digital editions had higher resolution video and graphics - they are several times the size of this file and it shows.  Several times I wanted to zoom in on something in a photograph but it was too blurry when even blown up a little bit.  This was confirmed by the publisher that they send the same digital files to all e-book producers, and for whatever reason Amazon lowered the rez.  Since I have the hard copy book as well this wasn't a huge deal, but it was kind of annoying.  I'll stick with Kindle anyway - it has the best availability on all my devices, the most choices, and I like that my digital library all rests in one place - but if you are only buying the digital version, keep this in mind.  Everything was fine to watch/read, but if you want to zoom in and see detail it's just not there.<br /><br />The book itself, though, is absolutely stunning in the amount of data and material.  It's really unbelievable.  After reading you honestly feel like you were there for each and every day of filming these incredible movies.  I'd give the book itself ten stars if I could - the four stars is simply for the digital presentation itself.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved this series! Wished it didn't stop.  Best part of it way that they survived the baggage of past, present and future issues because of the love that they had for each other.  Hard to find that deep of love in reality, awesome to read about
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this film.  I rented it and then ended up buying the Blu-ray for the unrated version and to have as part of my collection.  It's no huge classic but it is a fun, inventive film - and Jeremy Renner is just a hoot and handsome in whatever film he is in.  Famke Jansen is also a real scream as the witch and while this movie isn't high art it definitely is fun for a rainy afternoon and the special effects are quite good and don't totally reek of CGI like so many films these days.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very cool game to play and train your own horse. so please try it and enjoy alot
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really glad it is finally on my kindle not my cell phone.  I can see it better thanks amazon.  I've been waiting for a awhile to play this game.
0553062182|5.0|it will help me with understanding my wife who is a Highly Sensitive Person looking forward to diving into it
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|What a compelling story. You can not wait till the next free time you get continue connecting with all the characters. No more Lizbeth story...sadness there with the death of the author. But don't let that from keeping you from reading the entire trilogy. Without a doubt one of my favorites.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Excellent series from excellent books.  Warning:  these are not for the faint-of-heart!  They are graphic and explicit, but the acting is great and the story is awesome (difficult to follow sometimes because of all the names, but they make it work).
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Very enjoyable movie. Usually my husband prefers action movies, but those generally turn out a bit bloody for me. This was a very interesting movie that both my husband and I could enjoy and recommend to others without having to add a blood/sex/violence caveat. -- ok, well there is a tiny hint of sex at the start, but nothing I would feel like I need to fast forward if there was a kid in the room.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I always love a good challenge and this is a great one<br /> Love the game it keeps u on edge to beat friends
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|Some of this is very good, like the dynamic heaviness in The Enemy Inside, or the best Rush song not written or recorded by Rush, The Looking Glass. Most of it sounds cheap, however - I'm looking especially at False Awakening Suite, Illumination Theory, and/or pretty much every time you hear a strings ensemble. Sounds like they wanted it to sound moody and emotional but went into that completely emotion-less. Don't get me wrong, some of my favourite DT songs are very moody: Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Octavarium, Breaking All Illusions. This album just feels rushed (no pun intended).<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most, however, are the lyrics. They do sound an order of magnitude less complex and poetic than anything they've done before, and I can't shake the feeling that what I'm listening to is christian music. I even feel dirty when I catch myself singing along.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Historically interesting and truly romantic!<br />I had seen the movie and thought it was boring - the music is beautiful, but the story was chopped off.  The book has so much  detail and history it is slow reading, but very interesting.  I am amazed by the vocabulary used in the classics.  They must have had much more time in school to learn the English language.  It is impressive compared to today's students.
1402568851|5.0|I LOVE this book on tape! This is a really unusual book but makes you think. My daughter gave it to me...it was a good choice!
B000FC10MU|5.0|I love this story.  I have read it many times over and I still get sucked in so I can not put it down.  Thank you Neil Gaiman for creating a world I love to go back to time and time again.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|This book was written so good, it kept you wanting to get to how her life turned out. Tears were shed but in the end it kinda left you surprised.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so addicting all of you guys should get it not just because there is a jetpack involved but it's just freaking fun get it now..!!!!
1401938906|5.0|Great experiments to enlighten your path.  Pam Grout has really set out the basics to help us see that our thoughts really do create our reality.  I am not so much on her idea of there being no God, but to each his own.  No judgment on her beliefs, however I use my belief in God to work these experiments.  Thanks, Pam, for showing some very simple and miraculous experiments!
B00CGNYDIE|2.0|I agree with Jeffery Michael Smith's review. Though, I thought the graphics begged an additional star. Well done, sir. Well done. Now, time to go back to Minesweeper.
0802473156|4.0|Beautiful book with an easy read. My boyfriend and I actually read it together and learned new things about each other. I would recommend this book so you can understand your partner's love language. Although you make think you know from how they act, it goes much deeper than that and Gary Chapman did a wonderful job expressing it.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|Have loved it since I discovered it for the PC years ago. Glad I can now get it for my other platforms.
0757302661|5.0|Used this method and loved it.  Getting this book for a friend.  Need to start early to give your self a chance to learn the techniques.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|So far this is the best racing game I've found. Everything about it is super fun. With all the cars and upgrades the fun never stops
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Very creative and well put together. The frustration is part of the fun. I highly reccomend this game.
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|This app force-closes 1 second after opening, 100% of the time (after 30+ attempts) with my Samsung Galaxy S Relay-making it only the 4th app out of over 600 I've ran on the device to do so, not good! Less than 1% of apps I've tried won't run on my device, so not sure what the issue is here, this is very unusual. Would have made the review 1 star except I got it as the FAOD (yay!). I've reported the issue to the developer (had to look the info up from Google Play since can't access it via the app, obviously), if the problem is addressed and corrected (or even if the developer warns of devices it doesnt work with in the discription) I will update the review. Sad state of affairs.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|The story is about a happening long ago at the House of Riverton.  It takes a very long time, with some subplots, to get to the actual events.  The ending, however is a surprise.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is really fun to play and gets your brain thinking. I would suggest this to all group ages .
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Each chapter alternated between Four and Tris, which sorta took me a while to get use to.  The action and storyline were superb, with a twist for the ending I did not expect.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a awesome game you get to find out how to build guns and then shoot them it is really cool nd worth the money
B007L96VCY|5.0|Good tune from an old friend. How can it not be right, it's Paul! His original words and musical talent never cease to amaze me.
1595825045|5.0|If your a huge fan, you have to get this book! Or even if your not familiar with the show,but enjoy art and creativity, you should get this book! It is excellent! It gives you the whole story of how Avatar even became a thought and how long and hard, it was to create books one, two, and three. And great pics of all the art and animation process that took place.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this is a great game but you cannot walk around so please make an update fore walking and trying to find the animals
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this game is cool I get to fight with monsters also make something where you get diamonds but yeaH this is EPIC!!!!!!
B00EJU8ZIG|1.0|....And if she weren't considered pretty, no one would have ever heard of her.<br /><br />So sick of manipulative media companies promoting physically 'appealing' musicians. Real talent languishes, while mediocre pretty people receive endless attention... and everyone plays along, because that's what's easy.<br /><br />'Our' reality and culture are almost exclusively just products sold to you by rich people. Sure, there's always been that, but now? Now that's all there is. We've abandoned ourselves, and pretend that selecting one carbon copy pretty person over another represents &#34;choice&#34;.<br /><br />It's truly pathetic, and products like 'Lorde' illustrate our total abdication perfectly.<br /><br />I love the arrogance she displays in her interviews... Poor kid actually thinks her superficial observations are profound. Why wouldn't she? If I were a kid and people treated my every inane observation as if it were significant, I guess it would have gone to my head as well.<br /><br />Had she been born ugly, no one would be asking her a thing. That's the truth. She'd sing at weddings for a few years, then slowly her temporary day job would become her life.<br /><br />All because we let corporations and the wealthy class define our reality.<br /><br />They pick 'em, and we pretend we're involved in some way because we voluntarily purchase this junk. We're walking through the line at a cafeteria, convincing ourselves that the 'freedom' to choose on prepackaged phoney over another is culture (or freedom).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the vampire wealthy chuckle at the easily manipulated livestock groveling at their feet.... The livestock that enable their unimaginable existence.<br /><br />We're serfs, and art is dead.<br /><br />(and yeah.... I AM super fun at parties; thx for asking)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Its the powerful game is the best game of the amazon appstore is addictive is wonderful and the app purchse of the twins coins is the best
B009MJU7K8|5.0|Very cute my daughter loves this, great construction very sturdy. She plays with it all the time, and asked for more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great Game!!!!!!!! Can't wait to see what they come out with next!!!! Wish the energy system was different but other than that no complaints!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Love the show.  But I don't love it blindly.  I fear season 2 might be the last one worth watching.  From what I have heard/seen of season 3, the show is beginning to take a downright goofy turn.  I hope to be proved wrong.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|Best book Ever!!!! Love Ellen!<br />Very funny and inspiring<br />Suitable for anyone<br />Reading this book makes me forget the stress
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really love the game. It is very challenging after so many levels. Would recommend to keep your mind alert.  This is a good excuse to use because you will become addictive. :-)
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is not as popular as it should be, I would be so bold as to say this is as good as the movie \\"We we're Soldiers\\"
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Overall this is a clean, straight forward and functional game pad to replace my N52. The change takes a little getting used too, but thus far I'm liking it, the only downside is the mode buttons don't change color. I would do a number of design changes to make this more functional and versatile, but I don't work for Logitech, and this is probably the better product on the market at the moment.<br /><br />I don't understand why people push the mini screen so much, I set it to monitor my computer performance and left it at that. The only time I take my eyes off the screen in my gaming (FPS, RTS, MOBA, MMORPGs) is in the moments between deaths to relax and breath a moment to re calibrate my sight and prepare my mind for the next spawn.<br /><br />The thumb stick is a nice, though change of touch as well. Able to emulate a joystick or mouse (the four way directional works too)  with a little bit of work and functional streamlining, I'm on my 3rd button layout to maximize this awesome tool.<br /><br />It's not perfect, still a ways to go but it's a solid device.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Great movie and franchise, and my kids love the convenience of being able to watch it anywhere, anytime; but I could have achieved the same for a $2 less by buying the combo pack at [[ASIN:B00AZMFK3K Star Trek Darkness Blu ray Digital]] I guess I'll have to be a little more selective before choosing to buy it through Amazon Instant Video.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This  dictionary is very easy to  use, the first time in the world is very important to me to have
B009X010RU|4.0|I purchased this after getting one for my 1st generation Kindle (7&#34;) and being impressed with the protection it provided, but I was concerned because this version seemed more fragile. It was thinner and had larger areas where it wasn't attached to the Kindle (because the 2nd generation has more buttons), making it seem more prone to failure.<br /><br />Having said that, my wife was in the hospital and accidentally bumped her Kindle off the tray table onto the floor (which is not padded, being a hospital and all), a drop of about 4 feet. It landed with a loud crack and I feared the worst, but when I picked it up the case itself had cracked, absorbing the impact of the fall. I have to admit I was impressed and for half the price of Otter boxes (which seem exorbitant for the value of what they're protecting) they've made me a customer for life.<br /><br />The only downside I can claim is that the fold over cover that doubles as a stand isn't very sturdy with any kind of vibration (driving in the car, or kids jumping on the bed). This is why it lost a star.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun to play wished u had more then 5 lives though very easy to move up in levels only bad thing is waiting for more lives. Great for any age good matching game for little ones
B004XQYBA2|5.0|The real advantage this program has over others in the genre is that there are literally thousands of unique puzzles. When I would play other Sudoku games I would get the feeling as I was playing certain boards that I had seen them before, like the random number generator would keep building the same games over and over again, so that I would eventually get to the point that I would intuitively know what numbers to put in what boxes even though I shouldn't be able to.<br /><br />I don't have that problem here -- every board is a unique challenge, and while I've only solved about 400 of them, I'm not about to slow down. I got this game as a FAOTD, but I would have purchased it if I had known how great it was versus its peers.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|For many of us that are unable to accept the dogma of Christianity this is a breath of fresh air.  It paints a picture of Jesus that at least makes sense to me.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Having played the original extensively, I was pleasantly surprised when this was released as the FAOTD and grabbed it immediately. It plays excellently on my 1st generation Fire, and is a great way to pass 15-20 minutes.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I enjoyed this.  It kept my interest and I thought the story was quite charming. I liked the tone of voice of the main character, Clay, and how you could hear his thoughts and asides.  I do think, however, that the puzzles were wrapped up really quickly and the audience wasn't really a part of their solving. Instead, Clay mentioned that he discovered something, and, poof:  there was the answer.  Since the reader was a part of most of the rest of the story, it would have been satisfying to have been a part of the final puzzle-solving too.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Lady Gaga is an amazing talent. She writes her own songs and has a vocal talent that doesn't need the artifice of auto-tune. I'm no prude, but I don't like that she resorts to swearing on so m any tracks.  In doing so, she relegates herself to the trash heap of artists that constitute most contemporary pop/dance music. I'd gladly buy a cleaned up version of ARTPOP if it was available. For me the vulgarity detracts from the enjoyment of the music.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I have never ordered an official controller that died within a year, until this. I received this controller back in May, on the 23rd, and it has completely stopped charging (It IS the controller, I have tried 3 different cords, both PS3 USBs, several USBs on my computer, and then hooked something else up to the cords and it charged fine.) I have tried pushing the reset button on the back as well, and still nothing.<br /><br />All I could do was watch what charge it had remaining in it run out, only to never come on again. I suppose you really don't get what you paid for when it comes to the Dualshock 3, considering I've had other controllers for years, or even decades, still working just fine.<br /><br />If this is the kind of quality to be expected of this product, if this is \\"good enough\\", then I'm afraid I'll have to store my PS3 and games in the attic, since I can't play them with this shoddy piece of junk anymore. I'm certainly not buying a new $45 controller every six months, rewarding their terrible product with more and more of my money.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think she could have still created an amazing story line without going for the shock affect she went for at the end.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|This is a pretty nifty device. It is light, compact and apparently fairly robust since I have had packed with my cables, power packs etc. in my accessories pack. I bought this because I am trying to figure out a lightweight travel system to avoid taking my laptop. I am photographer so being able to transfer my daily &#34;take&#34; is important to me. Also being able to access email and the web is also important.<br /><br />I have a tablet that I take with me. The tablet is fine although its Wi-Fi range is a little limited so I was looking for a device that would serve as an access point and (b) serve as external card reader/device attachment point. At $50, I thought the Kingston device was worth a shot.<br /><br />My tablet is an android  device. It hooks up well with the Kingston Mobilelite wireless although it is somewhat cumbersome (more about this in a minute.). As I mentioned earlier, the device is compact and light. Wireless is pretty good although the range is pretty limited. I have tried streaming video at hotels and my home (using Netflix which may not have been the best choice) The hotel speed was not very high  and so it was constantly buffering. At my home where the signal is much stronger and faster, buffering was significantly reduced although it did occur. I should note that my router is no located in optimum place and I was located in the den which was located fairly far away and the signal needed to go through two layer of load bearing walls. However, doing email and some web surfing was acceptable.<br /><br />Attaching an external HDD and SD cards works really well. A plus is that this device has a battery so one does not need to carry a separate power device.  The other big plus IMO  is that I can copy directly from the SD card to the HDD without going through the tablet. This was another key feature for me.<br /><br />So the device does what I wanted it to do! So what's the cons? There are three: one major and two minor<br /><br />The minors are:-<br /> The battery does not seem to be replaceable although in honesty I need to verify this.<br /> The wireless I think could do with a better antenna so as increase the S/NR. This will serve to extend to the range and perhaps  throughput.<br /><br />The major is that app needs work. While it works, it is Kludgy.  Using the device as AP requires setting up the device (which comes as an open connection) to provide security and it also requires you to do a two step connection to the network of choice which is buried a couple of layers down in the menu. I should note you can use the device either as an AP or a wireless card/reader but not both simultaneously. This is probably obvious but wanted to be clear. I really wish I could specify an imaging app  from the Kingston app as it will not read my  RAW files<br /><br />So I gave it 4 stars but maybe 3.5 because of the above. However, I should note it does what I need and with either SD cards or micro sd cards and an adapter I can copy directly to from card to HDD. At this price/performance point, it is worth the investment.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|I really can't say enough bad things about this movie.  Its is a waste of your money.  This movie should not have been made and the concept kept deep inside the money grubbing hollywood corporate marketer who threw this thing together.  Bad, very bad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish it had more levels. I was a good game to relax your mind before bed! Loved it.. would recommend this to anyone wanting a good fun challenge
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I have read and very accurate in its representation of a true American Hero.  This book captures his essence well, in addition to describing the culture of the teammates Adam called brothers.  Well written, Eric...and thank you.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a great game for my whole family...but i would like to be able to receive more free acorns. everything else i have to do takes acorns and it is starting to be a drag since i know i am unable to much of anything except collect money.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Gret read-makes you think. Very interesting for a physician to write a book regarding life after death. It is a verying interesting read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is a great mind buster...LOVE it! i am so happy i was able to down load the game. i have been waiting for it since i dont like going on facebook to play.
B004BC7MRM|3.0|Born Free is a great song, album is so-so.  Couple good songs that are more country/soul than the old-school Kid Rock bawitdaba days...
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had a difficult time getting started in this popular book ... not sure why.  It was a selection for our local book &#34;club&#34;.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|If you don't like Homeland you are probably from another planet.  Season two is just as thrilling and complex as the first.  I can't wait to see what happens next.  Fine acting all around and Claire Danes is a miracle.  This is what television should be.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|It's the Beatles, what more is there to say. Enjoyed them growing up still do. You will too. Buy it.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|They killed off M, which is kind of sad. However the message I got throughout the movie is the franchise is aging. Bringing in all the cyber stuff was just plain silly. Time to get a new 007. Some kind of hybrid of a Bronsan, a Connery, and a Moore.<br /><br />Needed more humor in it. It's not fun leaving a movie feeling shocked and depressed.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|This book is the first one I have read that gives insights into the thinking of the leaders of China, Russia, and several others. For instance, a lot of time is devoted to the centuries-old patterns of how the Chinese people think of, and therefore respond to, their leaders' doctrines. Chinese patterns of thinking vary considerably to those in Europe or the western hemisphere, and this is especially true when it comes to disagreements, war, etc. The book explains very well how the Chinese and Russians stood up to each other, and how the Chinese patterns of thought exasperated, not only the Russians, but the Americans and the Europeans. An excellent primer for one who wants to understand how governments operate.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I read so many books that are the same story told in a different way. Unique and well written.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|after losing two previous legends on job sites this summer because of not having a good place to keep it safe when not wearing it. I ordered a third legend and bought the charging case.It fits in your shirt pocket and charges the headset while in the case. no need to have a cord to charge if you had it plugged in before you leave the house.This is A Must have item if you have a legend. The legend has good sound quality and comfortable to wear.
0399226907|5.0|Its simple, introduces some basic counting, and colourfully illustrated. What more could a small baby want?  And for Mums and Dads, the card version of the book is virtually indestructible.
B00E9A656K|1.0|One of the worst games I've played it is slow and spams you with stuff saying 'Do you want to buy this car' Etc. WORST GAME EVER
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|After all of the four and five stars I thought this was the book to read.  The cover art is better than the book.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Apparently written for 12-year-old girls to aspire to an imagined life combining Facebook, Google, Tweet and all the newest thing whatever it may be,  Mae has drug-like induced energy.<br /><br />This was written by adult male?  Or, perhaps his daughter.
006202406X|1.0|I feel like I have lost an irreplaceable piece of my heart from an author who was clearly capable of more.
B003NX76BM|5.0|great book.  I really love her books and this one is really good.  Its a great story line and just as suspensful..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is challenging and fun I recommend this game if you want to he challenged if you aren't good at these things
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|Frankie Knuckles mix is the best. Excellent remixes overall. If you are a fan… add it to your collection. It's a keeper!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am glad that I found this series. Very exciting and a page turner. I cannot wait to finish the series, even though I am years behind!!! Read the book you will enjoy and be pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns. Excellent read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is very much the early Stephen King I remember. Wonderful until the last page! I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This is a page turner for certain but not a very good one. I read it in two days but then felt it was a terrible waste of time and brain space. If you are looking for a novel about the darkest side of the female gender read John Steinbeck's &#34;East of Eden&#34;. It's much better written and far more believable. Flynn's writing in Gone Girl is sometimes so vulgar and unnecessarily profane; her intention may be to shock and awe the reader but I found it to be annoying.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I loved it. I found it entertaining and graphics are very good also the story is challenging but very fun
B00632HWOG|4.0|Love this app. I have it for my smart phone and kindle fire. I love that it gives you notifications when you have email. My smart phone was set up for Gmail by default so my Yahoo mail wasn't connecting to the email on my phone. Downloading this app fixed that problem.
0316204366|4.0|Very interesting and readable but all the premises are not as deeply researched as I would like.  For example, the author states that the small classes at an elite private school may not be an optimal educational environment. This claim is not well supported by the author.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I was so happy to finally find this app. I love the convenience of a tablet but sometimes android tablets are a pain when you are trying to load email documents. It is so not to have to use a laptop to view documents anymore.
1476729085|4.0|A clever and funny plot but the use of the F Word by Rosie prevents me from recommending this book to an older generation who still find its use off-putting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive. I have this on both my tablet and my phone. I don't have Facebook so I do this all on my own. The waiting for lives isn't so bad and I like that if you don't have Facebook you can  do quests to cross the map.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had no idea when I purchased this that it was a follow-up to The Shining. Probably had I known I wouldn't have bought it since The Shining is one of my least favorite King books, but I'm glad I did. I loved it. Dan is a likable man (for the most part) who I wanted to see win. I realized in reading this book that a lot of my hatred for The Shining is because of the movie. I didn't like the child actor who played Danny and I am not a fan of Shelley Duval, but I forgot that there was so much more to the book.<br />Worth the money, a great read.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|The best of the angry birds series in my opinion. I love how there are two sides and you can play as the birds and the pigs. My kid is entertained by this for hours at a time. The different power ups for the different characters are really cool too and they match what the characters in the actually movies could do. The levels are more challenging too.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is the best book ever read, took me to the last moments of my mother in the hospital, miss her...
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|I felt like this game was a little misrepresented. It seemed like a lot  involved find game but I really didn't enjoy all the reading. I found it a little boring and more work than I like for a find game.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Pacific Rim is a movie depicting a war between humankind and monstrous alien creatures pits a former pilot and a trainee who are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.<br /><br />The movie drew me in with the interesting concept of robots versus monsters plot line (ala Godzilla) and interested my inner 12 year old. Although very action packed and with good special effects, I just feel the movie missed it a bit. The plot to me didn't develop the things that it should of and concentrated too much on the action and fighting scenes which consumed most of the movie. I mean it took years to figure out how to breach the alien world and destroy it with a nuke? The lack of character development and lack of story about the alien origin was disappointing as well. To me the worst aspect was the poor  and over the top, like in a video game, acting with lines that made me wonder who wrote this. And granted, maybe this movie was designed to appeal to the 9 to 14 year old age range, that could have been done with some better known and better abled actors.<br /><br />With that being said though, for an action movie it is ok and at least an original action movie idea for the summer as opposed to the sequels or remakes that seemed to dominant the summer. Pacific Rim is in a way a tribute to those type movies that came before it. It unfortunately doesn't add anything new or original as far as plots go and ends up with a predictable conclusion.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|Great mobility information and examples! Explains why each technique works which is great for those of us who like to better understand why we do certain mobility moves in the box.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I love this series. I flew through every season over the spring. My husband never gave it a fair shake, never watched it. He just watched 3 episodes this week and is totally 100% addicted.
1569242739|3.0|I found the recipes difficult, you need to be familiar with Vegan cooking to appreciate the ingredients. The muffins I made needed to be eaten the minute they came out of the oven, they do not keep well.
006202406X|1.0|Its not often that I finish the last book of the series and it ruins the whole series for me. Were I was once excited over the movies, now not so much now that I know how it ends.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|All of these books were amazing but this one I don't really know it was just something different.  I wasn't sure what to expect of the third book in a series as many tend to get boring.  This book was far from boring and ended in a twist that many wouldn't expect.  It was emotional, shocking, and eye-opening.  Veronica Roth's use of words and the way she forms her sentences is remarkable and really adds to the book.  Made me cry not only of sadness but of joy.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Awesome movie, great story very different from the original. The casting was very good, very well done special effects. Just great!
B000NVT0RU|5.0|This is a superbly filmed true story of a group of Algerian men who volunteer to fight for France in WW2, and of their subsequent treatment by the French army and French nation.  It is immensely moving, and tastefully done; I use it in high school French classes.
0062287338|1.0|Spoilers in review. -  Divergent was a good start.  The beginning dynamic between Four and Tris is what prompted me to keep reading, and I'm upset I did.  Not only does their relationship not advance it deteriorates.  In a span of a few weeks Fours redeeming qualities are gone and they spend more time fighting than establishing a solid relationship.  I crossed my fingers hoping the ending would succeed with a hail mary....no such luck.  Tris dies for shock value while all the antagonists live.  Movie will suck.  Worst trilogy ending, ever.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Nice game with a lot of variation. always a lot of rooms to choose from. Downside is you run out of bingo chips quickly.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Just like playing alone...Don`t want or need friends...or to tell anyone how I`m doing. Also annoying to have to constantly buy diamonds...
1932100660|5.0|Recommended by my doctor and it changed the way I eat and live!<br />We use the Forks Over Knives cookbook and the Engine 2 website for nearly all of our meals now and I've dropped 9 pounds in a little over a month.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I feel that it's good because if you are board this never gets old I even got my grandma hooked on it lol
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Excellent story. Intelligent writing for intelligent youth and for adults too.  Man is the folly of man. But so it's savior
0345529057|5.0|I love reading books that draw you in right away and tell the story so well that it makes it hard to put the book down...the first book in the series has done that. I look forward to the same situation with the other books.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It makes me want to cry because there is more than a hint of super cognitive power available, but why always fighting evil.  Why?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool so awesome no game con defeat this game at all ever I love dis game
B005COO1X6|5.0|You do not need to be a King fan to enjoy this one.  It's a book you want to keep, to read again, to not sleep through the END -- ing.
B004NJW96C|4.0|Eery tunes of isolation well-described by Moby's liner notes - the feeling of a city after a concert when the streets are empty and echo.  A favorite in my current playlists.
0345347951|4.0|If a take time to read science fiction, I know I will not be disappointed reading Clarke.  Well ahead of his time and building on what he foresaw, he is a &#34;must read&#34; author.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Getting into electronic music, this was a reach based on prior high ratings on Amazon.  WOW!  First listen is strange.  Second is intriguing.  After a week, it's a stunning revlation to me.  I'm haunted by it, after a month.  I'm still listening to it every day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when Amazon put Candy Crush Saga on the Kindle. I can play this game non-stop! :)
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Protected my phone when I dropped it in the ocean. I had been on a field trip the year before and destroyed my previous iPhone when I dropped it in the ocean, so I got this product. It worked great! I combined it with the armband and the lifebuoy. Both worked well, but this was by far the best of the products.<br /><br />The only problem is that you could only charge the phone using an apple charger AND it was not possible to read a jawbone exercise tracker even using their little adapter for the earphone jack.<br /><br />Apple had a much cheaper water-proof package, but it is more like a plastic bag on a string. I liked this because it still had the iPhone look and feel.
B0072OFM28|5.0|BECAUSE IR SIMPLY TELLS THE STORY OF SPARTACUS ASX I ORIGINALLY PERCEIV ED IT TO BE ... AND THE ACTION IS &#34;wow&#34; to say the least
B0084U0IEG|3.0|This was a cute book.  I can't tell you why because it would take some of the cuteness away.  I found that it dragged in the middle a tad bit, but if you stick with it, it has a satisfying ending.  If you are a spy novel nut, you won't be too impressed with his conversations about spying and tradecraft, but it's sufficiently compelling to move the story.  I can comfortably recommend it.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Really like this game.  Colors are great .  Really like match three games and this is going to be one of my favorites.  Would recommend. Well worth .99.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|What a strange little book.  Full of magic and fantasy.  Not what I usually read, but I couldn't leave it for long.  So well written and the word usage was beautiful.  Geiman is a wonderful writer.  I may try something else some day when I'm looking for &#34;different&#34; dreams.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|The book is so interesting, and it was so wonderful to watch Dr. Taylor work on and manage to overcome it.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I thought that this movie would be totally awesome when I first watched the trailer, but I was a tad bit disappointed by the result of the final thing. I thought the special effects and editing were pretty good and kept people intrigued, but it was kind of slow going... sking a little bit too much time to get the plot moving. Most of the movie was pretty predictable , but over all, I thought the movie was pretty good!  The ursa was pretty cool looking, I guess... You should watch this at least once!
0374280967|4.0|Hilarious, British wit...the Queen discovers the book mobile, and suddenly is late for important events, questioning why certain protocol exists and is ultimately changed forever, to the chagrin of her staff and the delight of her people.
B00C2I9WGG|4.0|The plot was engaging but the writing could have been better. Overall very pleased for a book inspired by a tv show. I have already ordered the next one.
0143124544|5.0|This book is absolutely beautiful. It affected me so deeply, and it has taken some time for me to process it enough to write a review. I had no expectations going into it, other than my best book buddy said it was excellent. (She's always right.) Me Before You is the second 5-star book I've read this year, and I'm pretty stingy with my stars.<br /><br />I really shouldn't tell you too much about the story. You need to read it with no preconceived notions. Will is a high-powered big shot who lives life to the fullest every day. He's successful, rich, handsome, and used to everything going his way. He's traveled all over the world, and always dates the most beautiful women. And then he has a tragic accident that leaves him without the use of his limbs. Enter his paid companion, Lou (short for Louisa). She's a small-town girl who has never been anywhere exciting, hasn't done anything exciting, and has no desire to do anything exciting. She's lived in the same town where she was born, still with her parents, and has stuck with the same, boring boyfriend for years. But she's content that way. Will is downright mean to Lou when she first starts her job as his companion/caretaker. But she tries to understand his anger and frustration, and she refuses to let him get her down. Eventually, her quirky, upbeat personality wins him over, and they forge a beautiful friendship. I won't tell you more.<br /><br />There is a very controversial social/moral issue at the heart of this story, and I feel the author addresses it beautifully. You find yourself seeing and understanding both sides of the issue, and for me, it really made me question what I would do if put in that situation - either myself personally, or someone I loved and cared about. Moyes presented this issue without judgment and without being preachy or pushy, yet she moves you deeply and you care (and cry) before you even realize it. Bravo, Ms. Moyes!<br /><br />Because the story is set in modern-day England, there wassome British slang and references to things and places that had zero meaning for me. I ended up Googling and Urban Dictonary-ing several things, and I highly recommend you do the same if you find yourself a little confused. It makes a big difference.<br /><br />Don't even go into this book thinking it's a romance. It's really not. It should be categorized as simply really good modern fiction. Don't miss it though. Truly one of the best reads of the year for me. Five stars without hesitation; I wish they were all this good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game and sometimes challenging, Glad this finally on Kindle, on the downside of the game, I spend to much money
193700788X|4.0|I cannot believe I have read 13 of these books. Really? I've invested that much time in Sookieland?! But it has been a fun ride! Thirteen is my favorite number, and while this wasn't my favorite book in the series, I thought it was better than most.<br /><br />I liked how all the important (and some not-so-important) people in Sookie's life made an appearance in this last installment. All the loose ends were tied up and all the conflict was resolved...for me, in a pleasing manner. We're done with the fae (thank God, right?), done with the fighting and fearing for Sookie's life. And in the end she chooses to be with the right guy, the one I was rooting for all along.<br /><br />I felt like the writing was a clunky and awkward at times. It certainly didn't feel as good quality as most of the past books (minus maybe #1 and #s 10-12). And I think the plot was a bit convoluted and difficult to follow. I couldn't figure out why the &#34;bad guys&#34; were trying so hard to get Sookie, why they cared. Their reasons for wanting to kill her just didn't make sense. And the connections between all the &#34;bad guys&#34; were just weak. It certainly seemed as if Harris was a bit tired and ready to be done with Sookieville. I don't blame her; it was time.<br /><br />I'm glad I met Sookie and all her crazy, scary friends. And I'm really glad I never got into watching True Blood. From what I hear, the books are far superior. This was a great way to pass the time during the summers. Definitely not high-quality literature, but fun, popcorn reading to put in between heavier selections for the past few years. Thank you, Ms. Harris! This one gets 3 1/2 stars from me!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie is amazing and it's a wonderful film adaption and i think everyone should give it a chance because really, it is that good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game it is so awesome I play it all the time I am just loving it so basically you should get this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it. I'm addicted to it. Somehow I just can't stop playing. I know a lot of people who just stopped playing, but I just can't do that. This game is way too fun to stop. It's extremely challenging, but so addictive.
B005DD7H50|5.0|One of my most favourite pictures of all time. Unique and original story, made by an extremely talented actor (Cooper) to produce a magnificent piece of entertainment.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Very good cooler for the money. The mount is a little less secure than I would like but works. Brought the temps well under control. Much better than the stock cooler on the AMD apu. I have a V8 in my other build for more bling.
098478280X|5.0|Awesome presentation. Very practical info with zero fluff. Great exercises you can use to sharpen your mind before or after the interview process.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|like original brand, works perfect, good connections to my new car audio. Really good alternative to the original audio cables.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Tarantino doesn't make bad movies but this one is another all-time favourite of mine. Brilliant acting coupled with original script brings a story of racial justice to life. A must see.
B006OITIQE|5.0|They're all good song  They're upbeat & make me feel like dancing.  My friend has it & I wanted it for my own kindle
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This app is so fun on the computer and Xbox but now you can play it everywhere at all time you should get it if you like the other devices game. I always loved to play it on my dad's computer. By the way it is really really really fun for everyone<br />. I've beat every boss on the computer to wall of flesh,wyvern,skellitron,destroyer,<br />Giant eye,the dragons fire and water and a lot more bosses to.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Great piano playing, great singing, excellent lyrics as usual. Could have left a couple of the slower songs off the album like My Quicksand, but all of the up-tempo songs are phenomenal.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very fun to kill time with! It is very Creative and very addicting! Im going to play this alot when i get really bored!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very realistic animals and scenery. It also has some awesome graphics and sound effects! I really enjoy playing this game.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Classic!  Movie puts you in the action without being judgmental.  Just documents what happened.<br />Recommended for music lovers of all ages.
075669812X|5.0|Not only was my son excited to get the action figure, but the encyclopedia has EVERYTHING LEGO ninjago, which has led to a lot of LEGO purchases. Each character has a story as well as the machines and weapons they use. Good and bad guys are detailed throughout the book. My son and I have spent HOURS reading and discussing this encyclopedia together. Great bonding time for the both of us. I was very please with the layout of this book and stories within. Also a great resource for purchases - it includes model numbers and details as to what a set includes. Great purchase!
B00BOXZAJ8|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Adam lives in a world that is quite literally upside down - or right side up depending on how you're looking at it. A more accurate way to put it, perhaps, is to say that he lives in a \\"lower\\" world, while a \\"higher\\" world - which looks much like his world, only upside down - hangs above his head at all times. And if you're having a hard time envisioning what it is I`m describing, then I guess you'll just have to watch \\"Upside Down\\" for yourself to get the full picture. And what a picture it makes, as Adam falls in forbidden love with a girl from this reverse-gravity place, a land where all the wealthy people live and which is run by an all-powerful vulture corporation that literally looks down on the people below and runs their lives as much as possible - making this perhaps the farthest-out take on \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" ever put on film.<br /><br />Adam decides to go to work for the TransWorld Corporation when he finds out that his Juliet, known as Eden, works there. The problem he has in getting together with her is twofold: 1) she is suffering from amnesia as a result of an accident and no longer remembers him, and 2) it is virtually impossible for anyone from the bottom world to cross over to the top one without being detected and summarily punished for the violation. Bob has also invented an anti-wrinkle cream based on the principles of anti-gravity that he hopes to market to the world above. But his main reason for being there is to reconnect with the woman he loves (and don`t think the two characters don`t wind up living up to their allegorical names in the end).<br /><br />Written and directed by Juan Solanis, the French/Canadian \\"Upside Down\\" is one of those rare science fiction films that actually expands the limits of one's imagination.  Overflowing with you-really-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it art direction and visual effects, \\"Upside Down\\" takes us to a place we've never been to before and will likely never see again. It's simply that unique and visionary.<br /><br />Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Duntz are utterly winning, charming and engaging as the couple caught between two opposing gravitational forces, and Timothy Spall is equally fine as Adam's co-worker from the upper world who befriends this starry-eyed newbie from below. And even amidst all the dystopic \\"Brave New World\\"/\\"1984\\"/\\"Fahrenhiet 451\\" - style tropes and trappings, Solanis has managed to create one of the most thoroughly captivating love stories we've encountered in quite some time.<br /><br />A movie not to be missed, and, when once seen, never to be forgotten!ique and visionary.<br /><br />Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Duntz are utterly winning, charming and engaging as the couple caught between two opposing gravitational forces, and Timothy Spall is equally fine as Adam's co-worker from the upper world who befriends this starry-eyed newbie from below.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Doctor Sleep is so much close to the Stephen King that I know and love than some of his recent books have been. It took me back.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|The movie was pretty entertaining with some good funny moments, but the 3D was quite awful. hopefully Avengers 2 is better.
B00BE97ONM|3.0|What would you do if your whole life was falling apart around you and the the one person you idolized above all others was a serial killer? Son Of A Serial Killer answers that question. I am giving Son three stars not because it was not a good book but because it could have been so much more.
B005QPMB2Y|3.0|I have to force close and open again, or reboot every time I leave the app and come back. It cannot connect to any camera until I do that.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|As I like to learn about WWll I often look for these books.  I was almost disappointed at first, but was soon hooked by the story and the interesting delivery.
0316204366|3.0|Good read but I like Outliers better. It's a little slow at times but still interesting. Give it a try.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book changed the way I think about money and investing and I highly recommend it to everyone. It's written in a very simple manner and contains a lot of anecdotes, which makes it a quick read. There's a reason why it became an instant classic. I don't think it's as necessary to read his entire series but this one is most certainly a staple.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this primarily to cast the content from the chrome browser. I am very disappointed that it did not work properly. The connection keeps dropping or freezing. This is a bad product design.  I did not try the other apps becasue I already have them on my connected TV device. I have returned it and will not recommend it to any one.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book so much both me and my sister finished it I have read all the other books
B001IXSU8M|5.0|Probably Lady Gaga's best album after Fame Monster.  The tracks that never made it to the radio are some of her best.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Good read,  couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the next book to see who gets picked. Love this story.
B00000FCBC|4.0|Worth the money...some really good sounds and some I never heard of.  I play it loud when in the shop working on the bike and hammering down a few cold PBR's.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A solid game of solitaire with adjustable cards and backgrounds. Sound effects are just right with the option to adjust accordingly. The guys a great rainy day game!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I am strangely drawn to this series, and yet I almost have a love/hate relationship with the show (or the characters). Even though it is fiction, it gives me a bit of an inside track into corporate America and all of the power-plays that happen.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|BEST show EVER!! I cant say enough about how awesome this show is. Sex, blood, violence, and historical. all wrapped up in a bunch of awesome!
B007SGM084|5.0|Favorite book - just like the crossfire series this is an excellent book!!!! I cant wait for the movie to come out!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The series is awesome!!!  I love all the scenery, the characters, the plot.  Everything was done with such authenticity.<br />I just felt like I was there.  Incredibly done!  I just don't know what else to say.  Please hurry and make season 2 available!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I wish they would come out with book 4 and 5 soon! The suspense is killing me!!!! This is an excellent book!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great and is almost completely invisible on the back of my small kitchen TV. I love the quality. Great price for my use as it stays in the kitchen or travels with me and allows me to stream Netflix or Hulu. Which is all I wanted :)
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is great.  I knew a bit of Spanish before but I started at the beginning.  I'm getting pretty good.<br /><br />I didn't think an app would work for me, (especially a free one)and it's difficult sometimes to remember the accents when I'm spelling.  But I'm finding it easier and easier to create my own sentences and can &quot;translate&quot; some of my children's books into Spanish.<br /><br />You have to make sure to go back and strengthen your skills once a week or so.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This was a creepy read :) Great story and beautifully written. I am through and through Stephen King fan and this was a great, short read.
0812550757|5.0|Great book.  You can definitely read it before or after Enders Game... but I recommend after.  A good fun read.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games) is the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  Having read the first two I had to read the last book but couldn't find it in any stores.  Of course Amazon had it, they have everything!
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This is a very fun physics puzzler that works for adults and kids. Yes, it has somethings on common with the &#34;annoyed avian&#34; game. Where I like this one a bit better is you can see the entire playing field on each level. No need to ZOOM in just to see everything like I had to do on my tablet with the other game. You win a level and don't feel the need to play it hundreds of times to get that one extra star. That takes some pressure off and just lets you finish a level and enjoy it.<br /><br />The other thing is restarting a level is nearly instant. That means you are not penalized for trying things and a miss does not seem that big of a deal.<br /><br />I am playing on a Samsung Note II and a Xoom tablet. Both are very responsive. I have not felt like a touch did not register causing me to miss a shot.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|I love the old nin...  head like a hole....  closer....  this album doesn't seem to have the same impact.  No energy like had like a hole and no emotional energy like closer.  It definitely has the NIN sound so I still have it a 2.  It just doesn't sound substantial or spontanious.  NiN has always sounded both, which is what made them so incredible.  This album doesn't like up to that in my opinion.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I thought savages was a pretty good movie but not a family movie. All the actors did a good job all in all
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|When I found out this was the last season of ghost whisperer I started crying only because this show has been my favorite TV show for 5 years. I loved jim and Melinda's son Aiden he was so cute and adorable and guess what he can do more than Melinda can. I have a feeling he has a big destiny in store for him. I found the storyline of the season to be very fascinating and unique. We learn and shadows and lights which are spirits which only aiden can see awesome right. I'm going to miss this show it was the best. 5/5 stars best season yet:-)
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|I thought this was boring and way too long. Don't waste your money on this. Wait for it to come to TV or redbox
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Good story. I like watching these types of movies, but would certainly never want to be involved in real life. Being erased, even without the  CIA attachment and training would be an awful nightmare.
B000SQFC0E|1.0|We could not play on our set so had to give it away.  Don't have any feedback on how it was or content.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad I can finally play candy crush saga on my kindle fire!  I also have it on my smart phone &amp; they sync with one another so I can continue my play on either device whenever I want.  ALL THE MORE FUN FOR ME!!!!  :-)
B0000024K1|5.0|What can I say about this classic masterpiece, it's PE at their absolute finest. Chuck D is in his finest form and socially and politically tearing s..... up through thoughtful and brilliant lyrical displays of venom baby. So many highlight gems on this album like &#34;Don't Believe The Hype&#34;, &#34;Black Steel In The Hour of Chaos&#34;, &#34;Rebel Without A Cause&#34;, &#34;Night Of The Living Baseheads&#34;, &#34;Bring The Noise&#34; and so on. Another all time great album, they sure don't make rap music like this anymore and that's a fact.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Though it got off to a slow start, the book became impossible to put down. I felt a sense of appreciation for the lessons learnt whist reading though and it left me pondering on LIFE in an intense way......great read!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Friends kept telling me to read this trilogy.  I saw the U.S. movie of the first novel before I read it.  Loved the movie.  Just finished the first novel of the trilogy and loved the novel.  I think the female protagonist is exceptional.  Her intellect, her strength, her ability to be different and yet a sympathetic character, her daring to live a life outside the borders, her authenticity....amazing.  I'm thrilled this was my FIRST Kindle read.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is just not the type of game I enjoy playing.  Maybe if I were 60 years younger, I would.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awesome game to play with friends and is a lot cheaper than computer or xbox minecraft however is not as deatailed and only has three kinds of terrains. I have personally never found diamond on it but there might be since there are diamond tools.iron and coal are all I have seen in survival. basicly just don't expect everything to be just like the computer or even xbox version because its not, but still super fun and as I said before even better if your friend has it installed on their phone or tablet because you can play in the same world! hope this helped on making a desicion,, bye!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is totally awesome I enjoy playing it only that you have  5 fights for like at a time but other than that it's a great game
1892005034|5.0|If you are looking for a step-by-step process for improving your communication to resolve conflicts and enhance your relationships, then Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life is the book for you. Many books offer guidelines to follow in order to improve interpersonal communication, without providing any instructions on how to apply those principles in real-life situations. The textbook for my Interpersonal Communication class, Interpersonal Communication: Everyday Encounters by Julia T. Wood, is somewhere in between the two. While it does offer some specific suggestions for improving communication, it also leaves a fair amount of uncertainty about exactly what to do when conflicts arise. More than any other book I’ve read, Nonviolent Communication reduces this uncertainty by offering a framework for communicating compassionately and constructively to restore harmony in relationships.<br /> One thing the two books have in common is that they both emphasize the importance of owning your feelings when communicating them to someone who has upset you. Both authors suggest using “I” statements such as, “I feel hurt when you…,” rather than “you” statements such as, “You make me so mad when you…” Owning your feelings helps you recognize that you have control over your feelings, so you have more control over how you respond to those feelings. Using “I” statements decreases the likelihood that the other person will become defensive and makes it more likely that they will not be responsive to your concerns. Not surprisingly, both authors also point out that it is essential to identify precisely what you are feeling before attempting to communicate those feelings. As others have pointed out, the language in the examples provided in both books can seem unnatural at times. I think the important thing is to grasp the principles they attempt to illustrate and practice applying them in a way that seems natural to you.<br /> Another connection I foundbetween the two books is what Wood refers to as engaging in dual perspective, which is basically seeing things from the other person’s perspective as well as your own. Although Rosenberg doesn’t use the term dual perspective, trying to see things from the other person’s perspective is an essential component of the second part of Nonviolent Communication, which involves using the four basic steps of nonviolent communication to receive communication empathically. Although they use different language to describe it, both authors explain how seeing things from the other person’s perspective allows us to listen mindfully for the relationship level of meaning, and to use communication that confirms the other person’s needs. Rosenberg emphasizes the importance of confirming the other person’s needs by describing the behavior without evaluating it, one of several ways Wood recommends for confirming the other person. Checking perceptions is also recommended by both authors to make sure that you truly understand what the person feels and needs.<br /> Despite their similarities, the key difference between the two books is that Rosenberg outlines a clear four-step process for applying the principles to real-life situations. Since learning about nonviolent communication, I have used it and seen others use it to resolve conflicts quickly and easily. I’m still amazed at how effective it is at creating a dialogue that allows both parties to express their concerns without either party becoming defensive. Obviously, it’s not a magic spell that miraculously grants everyone exactly what they want. But as long as both parties are willing to make sacrifices in order to restore the relationship, then the conflict can result in what Wood refers to as a win-win scenario, where both parties get at least something that they want.

B000002OX5|5.0|I have nothing to say.  The songs, individually and as a collection (interludes included), say it all. The only real point of my posting this is to add another 5 star rating, to help offset some of the 4's.  Really?  A 4?  This album is a masterpiece.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I love these kinds of games.  I like not having to constantly build new buildings and stuff like other games.  I wish the energy filled up more quickly however.
B004PYWRQC|5.0|This film is one of Johnny Depp's best performances. His role as a rare book dealer hired to authenticate an occult volume possibly connected to Satan displays talents hidden in the Pirate of the Caribbean movies.  As his character travels through Europe Depp becomes obsessed with the origin of the book and its engravings. Wonderful plot and acting all around, with an interesting ending. Well worth your time.  If the occult and its association with the Devil is abhorrent to you, pass up this film.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great read, although it didn't really get &#34;great&#34; until later in the book, but great it was. The characters are funny, quirky and loveable (except her boyfriend). The complex dilemma gave the book its weight and worthiness and it offered a quick glimpse into the life of a quadriplegic. I still am not sure how I feel about either side's positions, but it certainly lays out an argument for both sides and gives you food for thought. I am so glad I read this book!
B004499LWQ|5.0|Great film. It's about more of a love square more than a love triangle, but it involves four insatiably different people and their relationships with one another. This is not a love story film. It's dirty, gritty, appalling, and honest. It's the dark side of relationships that most of us have encountered before but try our best not to remember. I love it because it's the most honest film about relationships that I've ever encountered. No one's perfect, and in turn no relationship is perfect. This film portrays that point to the bone marrow.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Gladwell is one of my favorite authors, this wasn't my favorite of his books but it still kept me reading. The ending was too abrupt for me, it just fell off and I was left saying, &#34;what??? That was the end?&#34;
039916409X|5.0|This is a great book!  It provides a lot of insight as to why we think the way we do about money and how to correct our wrong, negative thinking.  Every chapter is so enlightening with exercises to clear whatever wrong thinking we may have.  I definitely  recommend this book to all and consider it a must read.

B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|The Man of Steel is a great movie, retelling the first superhero in the comic world and I believe doing him great justice. The Film of course is about Clark becoming Superman but he isn't Superman just yet. One of the reasons he's not called Superman in the film or any where on the title of the movie is because he's not Superman just yet. So for respect of the movie, I'll just call him Super Clark. Well Super Clark makes a lot of mistakes, things he WON&#34;T make in the future, when he finally becomes the Superman. However, this movie made it clear that this was the beginning of his journey. One of the best flashbacks I have seen in a movie, allowed the film to progress very quickly and get to the real meat of the film, which was his Kryptionian brothers trying to obtain him, as Super Clark is a bit more essential and special when compared to his people. (Don't wont to spoil It) Anyways, once the Kryptionians come to get him, EPIC fight scenes occur and for the first time in live action, we get to see what a true Superhero can do. When I went to the theaters and saw this movie, I was purely wowed and if you give this movie a shot, you will too. But please be mindful, this version of Super Clark is gritty, a bit more like the comics now a days but still a good moral movie for the family. I give this movie a 5/5, enjoy :)

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Plays fine for me in airplane mode, on a Fire HD, so an active wifi connection is not necessary for play. My last videogame experience was Super Mario Brothers with my nephew a quarter of a century ago, and I tried this just for a lark. Now I'm hooked. I'd give it five stars, but Amazon's delay in providing the update is unconscionable. I strongly recommend a stylus. Also, go to Gameloft  Customer Care for Minion Rush and read through the FAQs. Even if you don't have a problem as such, there is useful information there.

B008QE9BS4|5.0|Absolutely stunning guitar work on an album of wonderful compositions. This album has heart, joy and love. His solo constructions are impeccable with his technical virtuosity clearly there but oh so hidden. THE MASTER of guitar plays with such conviction and beauty that I find listening exhilarating. His fellow band mates are superb with drummer Borot truly extraordinary, and M'Bappe on bass, as technically gifted as he is musical in his approach to playing and soloing. Husband on keys and drums is very good. Do NOT hesitate to buy this: smiles and wonder await.

B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle Monae, one of the most critically acclaimed modern day artists, delivers the album that we need right now but don't deserve...or something like that.<br /><br />I guess I'm the echo in the room because yeah...what everybody else said.  She's pretty much the best of all worlds.  Talented, creative, spirited.  Singer, composer, songwriter, storyteller, rapper.  Her talent is unreal.  She has me thinking she might really not be a real person because she is the perfect combination of legends.  Vocally she's one of the best resembling a young Michael Jackson on more than a few songs but at the same time unique on its own (a mixture between Fergie & JESUS!).  As a rapper she sounds like what Left Eye probably would've sounded like in 2013.  If she came out with a rap album or EP I feel it would be amazing because she has something positive and inspiring to say and she can flow with the best of them over some unique production.  She also has a smooth rap voice like Salt from Salt N Pepa but without the bass.  As a performer she's a ball of energy and the stage show is one of the best things going.  She can hit any dance move. In interviews she's thoughtful and eloquent, classy and sexy as a cover girl, she's always in her black and white uniform etc. etc. it just doesn't make any sense.  Janelle Monae is definitely a generational talent.<br /><br />Back to the music, it's a fusion of genres.  Or better yet an R&B vibe with hints and influences from other genres all molded together into a beautiful piece of art.  Although I loved ArchAndroid, Electric Lady trumps that album in my opinion.  It's more &#34;jammin&#34; and &#34;groovetastic&#34;.  I haven't even mentioned that she has collaborations with the elite.  First off she has PRINCE on the album.  PRINCE.  The anti-establishment himself felt the need to associate himself with Janelle Monae because PRINCE comes to you...you don't come to PRINCE.  And we aren't talking only production or mentoring...we're talkinga duet, a jam session.  Don't worry it's as amazing as it sounds.<br /><br />The Queen of Neo Soul, aka Low Down Loretta Brown aka Fat Belly Bella aka Annie (Don't Wear No Panties), Erykah Badu stuck her head back in the dungeon to see what the fuss was about on Q.U.E.E.N. another flawless song.  Miguel shows up for Primetime which is that old school R&B funk.  Solange appears on the title track, Esperanza Spalding on Dorothy Dandridge Eyes.  Janelle Monae is rolling in the power circles for sure.<br /><br />Fellow Dungeon Family members Cee-Lo Green The Soul Machine and Big Boi aka Sir Luscious Left Foot Son of Chico Dusty also appear if you happen to purchase from Tar-Jay and Janelle Monae is not over matched on the verses at all.<br /><br />There's nothing else to say, this one's a classic and easily one of the top 5 albums released this year by any stretch.  If you're still  sleep then wake yo a$$ up! 5 Stars.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|A lot of us, I'm sure I'm not alone, would like a charging device that connects easier.  Often I don't have good light to see up or down of the plug and a simple bump on one side should be standard.  I do like that the mini b is a standard but I don't think it's the best.  Will the next one be wireless or can we make a better one?  I shave a line in the case so that I can feel which way is up without have to put on my glasses to see.

B008JFUPK8|1.0|This is a dark violent version with no story and is overwhelmed with special affects.  It is not for kids.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|Overall - within the constraints of todays' trackers - good. However several critical flaws: not designed to wear on wrist - thus you will lose it eventually. Also you will forget it. And this means lost data and tracking. Totally useless for anything that is not walking or running. We spin every day and ride on road bikes, it tacks practically nothing of this activity. Same when we are on our stationary rower or do other exercise like yoga. Thus, in a nutshell, it turned out to be completely useless. After about two or three weeks of using, we did not use it regularly anymore as the data does not say anything about real activity for our lifestyle. We highly anticipated it and own other Withings products, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Without major improvements I guess this category will disappear soon...

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it really gave me an insight to how the mind can work sometimes to protect us. It gave me a little anxiety at times because I wondered what might happen next, but it was very good. I loved the movie, in this case of movie vs. book I did actually enjoy the movie more but the book is great too, just different.
B009EP3DJM|1.0|This might be quick, this might not be.<br /><br />At any rate, it won't be nice. What do you do with an album like Warrior? It's the sophomor(ic) album from a teen pop sensatition whose gimmick should have cast her into a pile with the one-hit wonders. But for some reason, Kesha Sebert's spunk had struck just the right chord with the young digital generation. And why not? Kesha started out as a background session singer for Britney Spears before working her way up to her own record deal. Kind of like a floor sweeper who gets to be a manager. Dr. Luke threw her a bone. The result was Animal, an electronic hodge podge of guilty pleasure sounds all under the persona of an insane trashheap! Well, that's a little strange because Kesha Sebert's demos range from electronic to pop to hip hop to country of all things. And before she could afford auto-tune, she was a pretty interesting indie singer. Animal, for what is worth, was a fun and upheat pop record that had far more personality than anything her contemporaries were coming up with. The issue? It was remarkably below the bar that Kesha had set for herself, and probably for her talent. Despite the onslaught of unnecessary auto-tune, Kesha has a set of pipes on her. Even if you can't hear it, they are there. And they are annoying.<br /><br />Cue 2012, and Kesha is back after her bratty debut and her slightly more polished follow-up EP Cannibal. Warrior is the latest incarnation of the glitter-coated pop star. And unfortunately, it's not very much different from her original appearance as the &#34;Animal.&#34; And I have to wonder, whose fault is that? Well, likely Dr. Luke. The controversy surrounding Camp Kesha and Camp Luke (and also Camp Flaming Lips) has been making headlines, and fans are worried this talented girl will never actually get the chance to prove what it is she can do. Initially, this album was going to be more rock influenced and less electronic, and the working title was Spandex on the Horizon. Again,you have to give the girl credit for being outside the box. The problem was that when the record was released, everything we were promised is nothing like what we received. I was looking forward to more focus on her vocals, more fun, and more of that spark we got when she first fell onto the scene with her unapologetic Tik Tok. But Dr. Luke and his production team seems to be focus Kesha into wearing her old costume that is tearing at the seems. She's outgrown it, and she's likely to become the American LaFee.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes, Warrior is a bad album. Upon first listen last year, I was so disappointed that I found myself agree with this girl. I had defended her against all the other pop music lovers who said she was a Lady GaGa rip-off, a promiscuous tart, a talentless hack who slept her way to the top. But I knew the truth. She was talented. She could sing, and if her demos were any proof, she could even write a few catchy hooks. But all of that was thrown out the window with Warrior, which showed absolutely no growth or change as an artist. The lyrics and melodies were bland knock-offs of the original album, and aside from one song, C'Mon, nothing on this album even remotely comes close to the fun I had on Cannibal. Despite some interesting collaboration, nothing here works in Kesha's favor. But in light of recent events concerning the shoddy deal she's in with Dr. Luke and the subsequent shelving of Lip$ha, her collaboration with The Flaming Lips, it just makes all makes sense. Kesha had almost nothing to do with this album, and she's admitted it countless times.<br /><br />And she's right. There's no Kesha on this album. There's &#34;Ke$ha,&#34; but there's no Kesha. And that's a shame. I look forward to Kesha's ninth album, the one she releases after she's free of Dr. Luke's stifling clutches.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I bought this for a 2-1/2 hour airplane ride. Given all of the negative press when this movie was in the theaters, I didn't have much hope for it. At $0.99 for the rental, I figured why not. I was surprised that it was as good as it was.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love this series. It is different than anything else on television right now, especially if you're bored of all the crime dramas. All of the characters are so developed, and I love the relationships between the servants and the aristocrats. I love being able to watch it on Amazon and watching several episodes in a row.

B000XUBFE2|1.0|I wanted to like this.  Really, I did.  There was a sub-story that I found fascinating and really great to read (no spoilers but it involves a handmade book) but the rest of the book dragged along very, very slowly.  I also found a lot of it really predictable with a lot of very flat characters.  In addition, while I don't have to have a &#34;feel good&#34; experience with a book, I found this as depressing as anything I've ever read, including the daily news.  Pass.

This made me feel that this was a bit misleading to someone who doesn't understand some one who is on the 'spectrum'.  I think we can all safely agree that Don was certainly on it!  However despite this...I still loved this story and Rosie and Don and the supporting cast.  I will look forward to seeing more from Graeme.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved the book.  With all the mystery and different turns the story took, I couldn't put the book down.
0553801473|3.0|I'm kind of over Mr Martin...way too wordy, way too many characters, too much graphic violence, and sometimes quite boring.<br />I will continue to watch on HBO whenever it comes on again, but will probably not purchase another of his tomes.
B001JIFYSA|3.0|I liked the theme but it was rated R for a reason.  So much unnecessary nudity.  It's a big romantic comedy about people having sex, no more no less.
1616960922|5.0|For a little bit of a novel, this is really fun.  Mr Sanderson has a quick wit - I'll bet he's fun to sit and chat with...I will definitely give this another read in the future.
B008602KQI|4.0|The book is so much better.  This was like a gloss of everything.  It would have been confusing without having read the book first, I think.  Some people I know said just that.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This film will open your eyes to just how hurtful and obscene it is to keep these intelligent, sentient and beautiful animals in captivity.What gives SeaWorld the right to think they can use these animals for entertainment. Don't be fooled SeaWorld is about amusement not education or conservation. They seek the almighty dollar even if that means keeping these large mammals in tiny pools, withholding food as punishment and forcing them into psychosis. I will NEVER visit any of these parks again or support any product that does.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Why don't you bye this book. It is 100000000000000000000000% awsome buy it buy it. How was this book written bye love it. See you later byes
B00F56AZK4|1.0|This had two block selections of free puzzles to choice from and you had to buy everything else, note much intensive to try their product.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Awesome, I pre-ordered it and love it, and it looks perfect with my collection, I am happy they didn't change the packaging so it all looks good on a shelf. I do wish though that they had released a companion for season 8 as they did with the other seasons.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I always need a great calculator, and this fills the bill. Easy to use and give me all the applications I need to do anything I need.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Something like the subway surfers game but better. The game has different locations where you can run. It's like being in the movie yourself!
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|What a wonderful movie! This had some of the greatest actors and actresses  and a great story. I had seen it prior to purchasing it and knew I had to add it to my collection because this was one I would love to watch over and over again.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love the game everyone should be so lucky to have such a cool game. If only the controls were a little more sensitive.
B00821OW8K|4.0|An epic-scope series bound to become great. The first season offers excellent material, although it could use some sifting. Some episodes feel long-winded, if anything happens. Nevertheless, you're quickly trapped within a powerful storyline. The mysterious alien race that has invaded earth is using mankind's own for it's own gains. This ends up revealing that the conquered human children are not only being controlled, but slowly turned.<br /><br />A father is followed closely as he seeks to protect his family. He is a professor in history, particularly fond of wartime stories. He strives to animate his comrades with tales of yonder, of how a few strove against many, and how courage seemed to be stronger than numbers.<br /><br />The power which this loving father loves his children is exceptional, the emotional impact significant. In the end, we are left in suspense as &#34;the professor&#34; is captured by the opposing force.<br /><br />Season 2 awaits with unexpected turns. I think it will gain a full 5 star rating!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's so more than just the sex scenes. Totally fell in love with Christian Grey! Must read if you are a hopeless romantic like me!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Even if you saw the movie, the book is still worth the read - looking forward to reading the other books!
B007XWFZSA|4.0|It's a really interesting book for first-time case interviewes, however it would be nice if it had more practice cases, anyway it's worth reading it
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Well done, well done.  Great photography and settings. Wonderful actors!  Delightful version (I've liked it better than any other version of Emma)
B00B19GKI0|5.0|You can never get enough of &#34;Snake&#34;, a great movie all around.  In other words, another oldie but Goldie to watch time and time again!
015601386X|4.0|This is a well-known story and is fun to read in German.  However, I would recommend that it be read by a German student with three or more years of German lessons.
006202406X|5.0|This book was a fantastic end to the Divergent series. In it Tobias, Tris and a small bunch of people from a group that calls themselves the Allegiant venture outside the boundaries of the city they call home and  end up discovering the people who have been running the &#34;Chicago Experiment&#34; in their city. They learn the truth behind the experiment and the world outside their little home. It is amazing to watch their struggle with right and wrong in this new world. The ending came as quite a shock to me and I am sure it will be well loved by divergent fans for years to come.
B002S218P4|5.0|Was really impressed with Buka my Spainish is not stellar I get by, you can feel her deliveries a international singer who is worth a listen this one should be included in your collection her band keeps her with the necessary back up to keep her going throughout each track.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The waiting in between episodes is unbearable! So much so that I'm looking for every show zombie related. But it's just not the same!
B000002H5I|5.0|The disc appears to be in good working order. I have not listened to all of it. I had it before. I loved it so much that I reordered it when I discovered that I could not find it among my collection.
1608870081|5.0|The last time I opened a pop-up book was probably in the early 90's, so this detail and size of the pop-ups in this book rather blew my mind upon opening it for the first time. It's absolutely gorgeous and something any Harry Potter fan would surely enjoy. Along with the pop-ups, there are also several removable items (little folded notes and stories). The book does seem a bit on the fragile side, however, so do keep that in mind if you are intending it for a younger reader. Between the removable notes and all of the detail in the pop-ups, care just needs to be given when removing and replacing items and turning pages so that nothing accidentally catches and tears. Be gentle with it, and this book will provide delight for years to come. Highly recommended!
B00006JSS8|5.0|Of course a Stevie Wonder Definitive Collection CD is going to be great. I love his music, and find this collection to have the key hits that I was looking for.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Straight up AMAZING show. Can't believe I did not find this show before! I cannot wait to start the next seasons!

1469984202|5.0|Very well written book, easy to read and gets you attached to the characters.  However it is rather dark and depressing.  Got the first page of the 3 chapter and had to stop, wish I could finish but can't.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I used to play Candy Crush - not anymore. Great game !!! Try it you will love it. Thank you
B003O86FMW|5.0|This a phenomenal book. I read it in two days and couldn't put it down. You must read this and this is ten times better than the first one.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This season is awesome so far, I love it.<br />each episode makes me want to watch the<br />next. Definitely an addicting show.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is one of the most compelling and relevant non-fiction reads I have read in some time.  Mr. Schlosser took great pains to document the history of military nuclear weapon safety and tell with it a harrowing story of a Titan II missile that blew up in its silo. The silo story crystallizes so many of the problems he unearths from his patient research, and this is not a hatchet job with some kind of political axe to grind. Between relaying how the general systems grew and the unfolding tragedy at Damascus, AK, there were points where I simply could not put this down.<br /><br />Time and time again, I was dumbfounded that I am actually alive right now, that we didn't all get blown up as a result of false alarms, bad designs, and bad decisions.  Did you see the movie WarGames?  Aspects of that movie were clearly based on real-world events with NORAD regularly warning of impending missile attacks, ultimately the result of a malfunctioning microchip, or wargame test data loaded into the production computer.  Did you know that SAC HQ had all communications cutoff from the outside world at the same time a B-52 on early warning detection blew up over Greenland?  You read these different horror stories and you realize that people have had to make snap decisions with limited, false data, on the assumption that getting it wrong meant the USA would be nuked first by the Soviets.<br /><br />While this book had special weight to me as a child of the Cold War, it is also highly relevant today on many other fronts.  What kind of battles get fought between the different levels of bureaucracy and government offices on issues that matter?  How does prestige and ego play in the design, maintenance, and oversight of these kinds of systems? What happens when a large infrastructure exists but then becomes ignored because it doesn't offer  a good career path?  As we build a new anti-terrorism system shrouded in secrecy and protected from levels of oversight, Schlosser shows what kinds ofnear-misses and ticking time bombs (literally in this case) grow up.  He doesn't make these comparisons, but the lessons are there.<br /><br />Lastly, this account left me with a newly found respect for people at the top who came to realize just how close we were to disaster-by-accident and worked to change it. Many of these people came to realize what nuclear weapons really meant and become advocates of stronger controls and even disarmament.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Such a fun family movie. I myself would have watched it without the kids. I laugh so much. And also the voice cast is awesome.
B001AG52AG|2.0|My (now 8-year-old) daughter and I read The Golden Compass and finished it the same night we watched this on Amazon.  We were both disappointed, her especially.<br /><br />For those who've read the book, as to be expected there were many shortcuts, twists of the story to suit something faster-paced and characters conflated or just not given adequate attention to feel like you knew what their personality or motives were.<br /><br />But beyond this, the movie just seemed like a rush to get through as many scenes from the book that they could manage, without really much of any character development.  IE, all plot and little character.  I feel like I have to go back and re-watch it because I'm sure I missed a lot because it was so rushed.<br /><br />The movie did do a great job visualizing everything in the book.  For the most part, everything was more or less how I had imagined this world to be.  Unfortunately, because of the pacing, one didn't get a great chance to really admire all that scenery, because it just went by too quickly.<br /><br />Due to that speed, I would guess that those who hadn't read the book would by and large be somewhat confused about the point of all this.  To them it probably seems like just a crazy fantasy adventure with animal spirits and odd steampunkish devices and vehicles.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert: I'll try to details some of the things I missed from the book that would have made a difference, so if you don't want to know about some of the details of the movie/book, you might want to stop reading.**<br /><br />There was almost no talk of the aurora or the city in the sky, something central to the book.  They do mention mention dust once or twice, but it's mostly Lyra suddenly figuring out what dust is on her own.  The only time there's discussion of it by an adult I think is in the initial scene with Lord Asriel at Jordan.<br /><br />Lyra's character was plucky but had very little range.  There are numerous times in the book where she cried quite a bit.  I guess crying in the movie would have meant either too much time, or somehow would have shown her not to be &#34;strong.&#34;  You got a tiny glimpse of how Lyra could lie/spin a yarn, but just barely.<br /><br />Lord Asriel was in the movie for all of two minutes probably.<br /><br />There was a scene in the movie that was not in the book that made zero sense - Mrs. Coulter slapping her daemon, then comforting it.  We haven't read the other two books in Pullman's series, so maybe this presages something in one of those?  But I kind of doubt it.  The only thing I can think is that either Mrs. Coulter has been separated from her daemon or she is a masochist, because you are supposed to feel everything your daemon feels - something the movie actually shows well for other characters.<br /><br />In general, the movie leaves out the more disturbing scenes, possibly because they thought they were too dark for a younger audience?  For example, while they do show the scene where Lyra discovers the child who's daemon has been separated from him (albeit it's a different character from the one in the book), at the end the import of this is spoiled because a) the child does not die, and b) his mother, comforting him, acts as if it's like he's lost a pet which she promises to find for him.  There is none of the shock of this, only a few signs that this might be more serious than losing a pet.  That's another omission here, although they mention at the very beginning that the animal daemon is part of the person's soul, they don't reinforce this with any other statement throughout the book.  About the only other indication is when a daemon (I think it's mainly just Pantalaiman) is attacked once or twice and it's human seems to feel it's pain.  So the whole idea of &#34;severing&#34; doesn't have nearly the import it does in the book.  I can imagine those who haven't read the book scratching their heads as to that whole idea, and just not getting that it was about the worst thing imaginable - even worse than death - for most people of this world.<br /><br />The movie didn't even include the final scene of the book - the opening of the bridge to the other world.<br /><br />Again, it was really disappointing from an adaptation point of view.  It was interesting to see the visualizations, but ultimately frustrating due to the limitations of film.  Peter Jackson made The Hobbit, a book much shorter than The Golden Compass, into a three-part movie.  If this movie had been given that degree of attention and breathing room, it could have really been much better, even great.<br /><br />It all comes down to money I guess.  Authors and publishers want to make money selling the film rights, and movie studios want to translate that investment into ticket sales and DVD rentals (or whatever the equivalent is for streaming) as quickly as possible.  It does take someone with deep pockets, vision, stubbornness and perhaps just their own movie studio, to pay adequate homage to a longer book that is relatively complex.  It's seldom done, and so we end up with very mediocre stuff like this film, which is ok for a family movie night, but probably never watched afterwards.  It pales so much in comparison to the book.  If you are watching this with your kids, I would highly recommend reading the book to them or have them read it, because it has so much more depth than this mere shell of a movie...ut the worst thing imaginable - even worse than death - for most people of this world.<br /><br />The movie didn't even include the final scene of the book - the opening of the bridge to the other world.<br /><br />Again, it was really disappointing from an adaptation point of view.

0345472322|5.0|Our Math Coach recommended this to me. This book changed how I teach mathematics to my students! This book is going to be helpful to any teacher, student, or life-long learner.
1476727651|4.0|Good read, interesting premise.  I liked how Stephen King moved the Danny Torrence story from childhood into adulthood.  However, &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; doesn't compare to &#34;The Shining&#34; for suspense and sheer terror.  Taken on its own merits, I really liked this latest novel from King.
B008XCJ03K|4.0|An amalgamation of singers like Of Monsters and Men, Alexi Murdoch, Josh Ritter, Jason Mraz, Jack Johnson; musically, I feel there's a likeness and if one likes the aforementioned, they'll appreciate Passenger. To what degree one will enjoy this band is hard to say. Worth the risk, and certainly worth a listen.
B0012EF0WQ|4.0|I owned this recording in my teens and searched for it for years.  I was so glad to discover that it's available from Amazon.  David Crosby was the most musically interesting member of CSNY, in my opinion, and this work showcases his talents.
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|OMG,I loved this book!  It was sexy and scary at the same time, left me wanting more!  Bring on the next book, I am on the edge of my seat waiting for it!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I think I read the whole thing in a week.  The book was interesting to read and the suspense was held.  Only in the third book it gets quite dark and not as enjoyable but it's good to finish the series.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Great game so far. Have not played on Facebook before but have played several of their other games on Facebook. Need to work on help menu
B00DU77QP2|3.0|It's an interesting read, with interesting elements on spirituality.  But the writing style was a bit bland.  It was ok to read but not enticing enough to buy rest of the series.
B0049U4NQO|4.0|The book was great, Scorpia thought of everything in their plan.  But it wasn't enough.  Alex Rider comes through and beats them a third time! This time he had Mr. Smithers goes with him to Cairo.  And he pulls off his last gadget, you'll never believe what it is! Also Jack goes with him.  Every chapter brought more and more excitement.  It's a great book<br />,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book worth reading. Even after Catching Fire and Mockingjay you want more books! The movie was good and I can't wait for Catching Fire to come out!

1781162646|2.0|Not a bad book, but not a good book either. The picture on the front cover is a misrepresentation of the actual story. A very small portion of this story is about a murder/s. Most of it it is about a young man working at an amusement park one summer. A nice little story but until the last ten pages, really not much of a thriller. And near the end of course you have to add some gratious sex to spice it up. I've never done this before, but I actually ripped 5 pages out of the book and took nothing away from the story. I know strange, but it proves a point. Like I said not a bad book, but not a good one either. Maybe if you see it somewhere for $1.99 it'd be worth it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|An awesome game!!!  Worth every cent! Very fun and creative!! It does your brain good but is also great entertainment!
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|A good book in what has become a tradition. This story moves a bit faster, and you may miss some of the foods she usually mentions, but the investigation is good as always

B0026NWBY2|1.0|The recording quality is incredibly poor, the music would be good but hard to listen to when the quality is so bad.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I've read every Scarpetta novel, even during the &#34;lost years&#34; before Cornwell got her groove back.  But as I read the first 9 chapters of this one, I was thinking it was time for Kay to retire.  First of all, I was flabbergasted at how disingenuously Cornwell inserted Scarpetta onto the scene in Newtown.  No doubt this was Cornwell's way of dealing with the tragedy, but to me it just seemed self-absorbed and completely unnecessary to this story.  I was actually offended.  Then interspersed with that we get more feverish poor-me-what-to-do-about-Marino crap.  Self-absorbed much, Kay?  And again, yet another unbelievable conspiracy against Scarpetta and everyone associated with her.  .<br />This book is at its best when it goes back to basics -- Marino being a detective, Scarpetta doing forensics, Benton profiling, and Lucy doing her tech thing.  That's what I loved about this series back when it was strong, and that's what continues to carry it. But so much time is wasted with all the other distractions.  We don't even get to the body until ten chapters in.<br />I don't need conspiracies in high places and &#34;everybody is against me&#34; angst.  I understand that authors and their characters need to evolve, but I still want a good mystery with a bad guy who's kind of scary and good guys who use their knowledge and experience to figure out how to stop him.  For a good part of this book I was thinking it might be my last.

B008EKOO46|2.0|I got this book because I really enjoyed &#34;Guns, Germs and Steel&#34; by the same author.  Basically this book compares and contrasts the pro's and cons of &#34;civilized&#34; life vs traditional hunter-gatherer tribal primitive life.  The author basically uses anecdotes about his travels (primarily New Guinea) to lend support to his conclusions.  The problem is that almost everything he says is already self-evident.  There is nothing to learn.  Sure, formerly tribal folks much prefer civilization because there are legal protections, relatively abundant food, medicines, comfort, etc.  Sure &#34;civilized&#34; folks have lost some of the benefits of the exercise that tribal hunter gatherers routinely get.  I guess I would say that my summary of the book is &#34;Duh...of course!&#34;  This book is not horrible...it is just boring since he gives almost no new insights other than the obvious.  Not worth the money
0738727326|5.0|The artwork is absolutely beautiful and so intricate! Immediately after opening the package and looking through the cards to look at the art, I felt a connection to these cards. I absolutely recommend to anyone!

B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I fully enjoyed reading this book, specifically the great depth of character development. My rate of four stars is due to the repetitive reminders of why Alma does, or thinks, or believes all that she does. But, others may appreciate such reminders. I simply feel that the author covered the topic fully in earlier chapters.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Very disappointed in this book. The first 2 were great but ended with the third one a flop. Hated the ending . Everyone one awants a happy ending. This one just stopped with Tris's death . Sorry I spent my money for this book.

It is fairly well organized and is very well cited.<br /><br />Where Start-up Nation falls short is the tremendous infusion of the authors' point of view in the narrative.  There's nothing wrong with Start-up Nation having an opinion - with it promoting a particular conclusion.  However, it often reads like a sales brochure for Israel.  Further, the authors fail to address almost any opposing view points.  It's as if their interviewees were selected (or quoted) to always reinforce the point that they're making.<br /><br />This bias further comes through in the chapters that talk about other Middle East states.  Why is it necessary to highlight the deficiencies in Arab states' economies in order to tell the story of why Israel is a Start-up Nation?  It seems as if the stories are included simply to make Israel \\"look good\\" in comparison to its neighbors.<br /><br />Start-up Nation is a very informative book.  If the reader does not know much about Israeli society and its history, he will certainly learn a great deal and be entertained while doing so.  On the other hand, it's a very biased book, so it's not always clear if that learning is coming from an objective point of view.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The product is not the game Candy Crush Saga; it is a different product.... hints and help for Candy Crush Saga
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great series, in the middle of season two and I am highly addicted! Great chemistry between Walter and Jesse. They are a clumsily put together duo with humor and humility- great balance of street smarts and books smarts to make you laugh.
B00E5I2M9K|5.0|I was surprisingly impressed. Being an old Viking from Viking Land (Norway) and all :)<br /><br />Both Thor and his kissing love were of the mature and reasonable kind. I could picture him as my son-in-law.<br /><br />My favorite scenes were from the Earth visits.<br /><br />Loved old Anthony Hopkins as Odin.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Hate this game - boring and not worth my time&#60; It has nothing that is redeeming.  Would not recommend it
B0084IHVGG|4.0|Great classic movie.  Enjoyed it first with my children and now the grandchildren.  Generally kids love stories about animals and this one appeals to most.
B00821OX98|4.0|For a TV series, very well done.  Normally, rarely watch commerical television due to the obnoxious, repetitive, self aggranddizing promotions..  Prime is best money I have spent.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I found it to be rather difficult to play as far as maneuvering Pac Man but that might be because of old stiff fingers.  I like the game and it brings back memories of the original arcade game.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Music in this is amazing. I watched this not knowing anything about Cher or Christina Aguilera and thoroughly enjoyed watching and listening to it.
1878424319|5.0|Really enjoyed the wisdom found therein.  Bought this as a gift for a dear friend, and enjoyed reading before sending.  :)
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I hate it when you deceive your customers by making it seem that this is the actual movie!!  Put the word &#34;TRAILER&#34; in the title, so we don't waste time and effort downloading advertising.
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I like the part where the three old people sprang out of bed nearly naked . Roald Dahl uses awesome adjective, vivid  verbs , .nice nouns and super similes.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|This is a great purchase. I strongly suggest any one to buy this. Well worth the money for this product.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Excellent writer, works well with an excellent software product.  Got this to go alone with the Lightroom 5 version, just as good as his other books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good. I love this app!!!! It's great. If I could I'd give it more stars. But i can't. So... yeap
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I love all the books dealing with the &#34;master chief&#34; so I wanted to add them to me ebook collection.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|Could have been an awesome movie just lacked direction. Tried to combine old with modern like my own private Idaho but didn't cut it.
0062183591|5.0|Absolutely spot on! Its pages are filled with information and data that I have used and referred to in making numerous board decision and presentations. Knowing how others think and why affords the opportunity to craft an argument to address their issues before they become issues. I have now read all three of the author's books and they have been most helpful. Knowing the research is there and can be referred to quickly gives credibility when making an argument.<br /><br />Knowing your opponents thought process that they are going to use allows one to head off unrealistic actions with informed debate and references.<br /><br />One should also study ethics before using the knowledge gained from the author's works. Aristotle was a great place to start from.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|The story is about the same as the TV Series, Castle, and it is fun to read.  No surprises as I have watched the series, but the book basically is built around one episode.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another great book in the Pendergast series! I definitely recommend reading g this if you are a fan o yeah
1616550414|5.0|Beautifully bound and illustrated.  This is a very detailed historia that anyone and everyone who loves the Legend of Zelda should own.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Very beautiful, nicely done. Another great 1 from the Fire Maple team. They have a nice standard they adhere to.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|similar to other games except for the money charged to continue after the time runs out. I like it. It is exasperating as games should be to keep a person coming back.
B0012UOWBA|3.0|Both lauded performers give the level of performance expected. But the situational outcome alternatives cannot be construed as happy no matter the outcome. Too much angst and social repercussion to have a satisfying happy ending. Somewhat stressful to watch because there are no &#34;bad&#34; guys, only good guys and everyone gets hurt.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I loved the phantom, but  this was just not as good. This suggests the phantom had relations with Christine and I just didn't like that.  I  didn't care for  the  settings either. I think  it could have been better.
B004KKXUOE|5.0|Magnificent rendition of Austen's humor and characterizations without a single over the top moment. A true delight for Austen fans.
0812994361|4.0|I loved Breakfast at Tiffany's. Great story, characters; well written.<br />Other Voices, Other Rooms is another story (pun intended) altogether. Time after time, when I was almost bored, he would begin writing so well it would make me remember why I love books. But something happened while reading that has never happened to me before . . . I couldn't finish the last 6 pages. I gave up. Only 6 pages left . . . Reading the last 20 pages of the book was like reading something that somebody had written in a drugged out stupor about a disturbing dream he had.<br />As it is, so many books, so little time to finish this one . . . even 6 pages.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Like watching a train wreck. But redemption does occur and satisfies as best it can. Accurate portrayal of alcoholism. Denzel steals the show. Riveting performance for his fans.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was drawn by the story of children sent on trains as if they were cattle put on display at the end of this train destination to find new homes with people who saw them as cheap labor, easy sexual prey or babies to replace their own lost babies.  The two main characters; women who were born in different eras yet seem to suffer similar backgrounds of abandonment from families was sad and yet both were survivors.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I like the amount and types of information presented in the app, but it's layout is very annoying on a tablet. It's more suited to a phone's smaller screen.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Good book for a beginner learning to brew. It teaches you the basics to start brewing early on but goes into every detail you could ask for in later chapters.<br /><br />It should be noted that I have the kindle edition and read it on the iPad. I have had no issues with the formatting of charts that other kindle edition reviews mention.
0385373791|5.0|A gift for our 12 year old grandson.  I had read reviews that these were good and when I gave them to him, he said his friends were just reading them and suggested he did too.  Great timing.
B000ID37LS|5.0|One of my all time Halloween favorites with such colorful characters such as the Judge and his old dog, as well as R. Lee Ermey doing his Staff Sergeant role.  Michael J. Fox can see the dearly departed and takes full advantage of his special talents to make a living, until the Mother of All Evils Spirits shows up and makes a mess od things.  But this eventually leads Michael to the conclusion of the death of his wife, and a new love.  This movies has some violence, but a willing suspension of disbelief will take care of the gory parts.  But I highly recommend this for Halloween.
B000PUXCPU|1.0|The band and the music is awesome. This rental is poor sound quality.Which is why you would rent a selection like this in the first place.
B000IKQK7E|5.0|A 1970's classic that spawned Toga parties across the world.  When I went to college in the 1980's, we had a Delta House on Campus.  I doubt if many graduated from that university.  Highly recommended and watch out, you may find yourself attending a Toga party.  The moral of the movie, when everything fails, don't get down on yourself, have a Toga party!
B00ECR7L0Y|4.0|Very well acted, good modern scene for the source material. Whedon's side project while taking a break from the Avengers is a must see.
B00CCMM8Q8|5.0|This DVD is fabulous on many levels.  He's a Michelin-rated chef who runs a 12-seat restaurant in a Japanese subway, and he is considered the world's best sushi chef.  It explores family dynamics of a father and two outstanding sushi chef sons, sustainability of quality seafood, and work ethic.  Subtitles. Totally engaging.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|It's the Beatles at their early raw best !!!  What else can you say about them .. the BEST band / artist of all-time ... head & shoulders ahead of any contender for the #2 spot ( the Stones or Led Zep ?? ). Both BBC sets are well worth buying ...
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's very easy to use.  It's nice to have it with me all the time.  There Is no excuse not to use it.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|GREAT BAND !! I saw this concert at the theatre on the big screen ... and I have seen them live in concert in the past ... they have a solid catalog of songs ...  and their showmanship & musicianship is superb !! Anyone who likes this band should invest in this set ... the highlight of the CD is their cover of the old Sweet tune  &#34;Action &#34; ... hard to believe they are in their 50s ... they surely bring a lot of energy to the stage ... hope they keep things going for several more years ... they should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame !!!
B0049JPU8A|5.0|It got to me fast and was in great shape when I received it, despite some worrying on my part. This is a great album for any mood, any time, with the added benefit of being something I can listen to at work with no worries of being glared at.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really like this book. It is very good. I like everything about it it is good. Very very good.
B00BEIYMTW|1.0|Haven't seen it yet, don't know if I will. I don't like the idea of a crop duster being a hero.  Spraying poison on or land and food. No GMOs.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|This is a highly entertaining movie, and a most successful adaptation of a theatrical musical.<br /><br />The acting, direction, music and visualisation are superb.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen movie versions of stage productions has witnessed how difficult it can be to make the transition from theater to cinema. Rob Marshall has made that transformation in a most imaginative and original way- having the movie glide from the gritty reality of 1920s era Chicago to a fantasy world- then back again.<br /><br />The singing and dancing is excellent.<br /><br />This is a textbook example of how to film a musical- and it stands a second viewing.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B006PW0F52|5.0|What a great and disturbing book. As you start reading it is describes realistic scenarios where we fudge the truth to make ourselves happy. However, as you read further and further into the book, you suddenly realise that Dan is talking about you and every one around you. The frightening aspect is that unless you can see the process for the decision that is made, you now start to question if the answer or data is really true and accurate.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic read and recommend this to anyone....

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I enjoyed that it wasn't about his Playboy image in this part.  Gwyneth stepped up in protective role instead of being the defenseless one though out the entire movie.  Plus I'm a fan of Don Cheadle.
B00E9P959O|4.0|It's good to see the guys go back and correct this one.  In its previous incarnation, this one was unlistenable for me and now it has found new life.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Not at all what I was expecting when I picked it up, or even an hour later when I'd read through a good portion of it. At times hysterically funny, at others deeply soul-searchingly sad, this book will make you run the emotional gamut and keep you glad of the journey. Having finished the novel now, I can't say for certain what I feel about it, other than that it was fantastic. Ask me again in a few days because it will take me at least that long to finish processing.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|it stinks u hardly get any colors and its boring i got it for my 5 year old sister even she hated it

006202406X|4.0|SPOILER FREE!<br /><br />First, let me say that this was a lot easier to read than ‘Insurgent.’ When reading a series, I usually do not go back and re-read the other novels (‘Harry Potter’ is an exception) because I just don’t have time with my grading load, but I HAD to re-read parts of ‘Divergent’ in order to read ‘Insurgent,’ which I did not like. This is not the case with the final installment.<br /><br />I was able to pick up the novel and read and remember everything from the previous book with no issue.<br /><br />Readers are thrust back into Tris’ Chicago, one full of corruption, one on the brink of total chaos. There is a fight for power as those who prefer a Faction life seem lost in the cracks to those who do not. But this is the least of Tris’ worries.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias reunite and decide it is time for outside intervention. It is time to see what is on the other side of the fence. The consequences are great, and the world discovered sends both Tris and Tobias into a tailspin. The question is, can they survive it—and can they find true meaning within their own lives?<br /><br />Roth really had me with this novel. I read the entire story in one day. I could not put it down. I had to see where she was taking me, and where she was going to leave our beloved Tris and Tobias.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, you cannot miss this conclusion to the tale. I do not care what you have read/heard/seen, etc. You have to read and experience it for yourself.<br /><br />With that said, I do have a few issues with the novel. There were several holes in the storytelling that were never answered. But I do have a theory: those holes were just a distraction to where Roth was leading us. While I have those questions, I feel as if I have enough of the story to fill in those holes myself. I just don’t always like to do it.<br /><br />I was so torn about this novel when I finished it. I could not reach out to my fellow readers if they had not yet read it—but I could reach out to the hubby. So, I asked him to read it so we could discuss the ending. He read it. Then he said, “You had me read that book and now we aren’t going to discuss it?!” That man.<br /><br />While I read a story of love and friendship, he re-read ‘Insurgent.’ He felt as if Roth just re-wrote the second novel in a different setting. This is what I want to ask you all: did you feel the same way? I did, and I didn’t at the same time. If that makes sense.<br /><br />But, he and I agreed on the ending—and without spoiling it here, let me just say that we both believe it was not the ending for this novel. I have spoken to several of my students and fellow teachers who have read the novel, and they side with us on this as well.<br /><br />But, I do not regret reading the series. At all. I really enjoy Tris and Tobias as separate characters, but I really enjoy when they are on the page together. Roth has a nice pacing to her storytelling, and while she is not a master at world building, she doesn’t need to. In this series, she shows how easily the world can be torn apart, a world that many of us already live in—in a metaphorical sense.<br /><br />If you are a fan of ‘The Hunger Games’ series but you have yet to pick up the ‘Divergent’ series, this is the perfect time to do it. All three novels are out, you don’t have to wait, you can read all three in a row. Then, come back and tell me what you think. I would love to know.y had not yet read it—but I could reach out to the hubby. So, I asked him to read it so we could discuss the ending. He read it.

B00F57VFXO|3.0|The story didn't hold my interest, but I think it would make a terrific action film. It's the kind of thing that relies on an immersive visual experience, and for my taste too much time was spent on describing the locations. In a film you could see all that at a glance, and the story could roll on unimpeded.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well written book detailing the amazing story of Adam Brown who overcame crack addiction to become an elite Navy Seal and part of Seal Team Six. Adam not only overcame his drug addiction but multiple injuries and setbacks to become one of the elite. It is also a great story of his Christian faith played out in his life - a highly trained soldier but also a warm compassionate man.  It was hard to put down
B00594XOZU|4.0|Blonde_Baller_23 I'm new to this so any one interesting can chat me. But so far it's easy to use and meet new people. Works great.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I rated five stars because this book deserves it and i did not for any part of the book dislike anything i did not like it because i loved this book so much i have been reading it every single day and am sad that it is over i would recommend it to anybody that reads this comment or rate and i hope you get this book right this instant.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's engaging writing style, combined with the examples of instant cognition and how the brain works, makes for fascinating reading. You will find yourself thinking about this book long after you finish it--and if you're like me, you may even go back and re-read parts of it. Well worth owning this work.
B00009RDG8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The action is as real as you're gonna see from Hollywood.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Easy to read and understand. I loved it. I however think this book or at least the link should be made available at the uploading page or maybe at the FAQs. This would help with the quality of uploads. I would have given a 5 but i must say somehow this is not all.
B000SW4DXK|4.0|A magical movie full of the wonder of Christmas and seeing it through a child's eyes.  Love the remake of this movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was our latest book club selection.  All of us really enjoyed it and the interesting discussions that followed.
159315724X|5.0|Very inspiring book for all to read!  You don't have to be starting your own business or be an entrepreneur to read this book.  This book applies to SO many areas of your life.  You do not want to miss out!  Worth the purchase as it is a book you will want to have in your library to read over and over again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved it! The book is packed with breathtaking stories one after the other; cannot stop reading. As always good and bad guys, but difficult telling them apart.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book shook me to my core. I wish it was required reading for all Americans. Thank you, Mr. Luttrell, thank you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I hate the game it stinks like my bunny! it should have never be invented!! jk! I love it! Lol!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a fun game, I'm already addicted after playing for just one day. It's pretty realistic and poses a challenge but at the same time is very doable and fun. You should probably download now:)
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It took me five books to figure this out, but now I get it. In GRRM's bio he has some screenwriting credits. Duh! He's a screenwriter! These are not novels, they are scripts, complete with everything everybody involved in the production needs to know - all the costumes, sets, props, extras, set dressing, lighting, atmospherics, score, dialogue,... He's just making sure the producers get it all right. (It'd be like Michelangelo writing in all the little numbers on the Sistine Chapel ceiling so his assistants could put the paint in all the right places!) You can see how that has evolved over the years/books. By the last two books he's figured out that if you make the production lavish enough, you don't need so much story. Curiosity may compel me to read #6, if it is published before I change channels.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey is talented. No question.<br /><br />The music always has a good beat and I enjoy the jiving and energy she puts out through her tune. It helps me gain the energy I need to get the lawn mowed or to help me smile.<br /><br />I hope everyone will give this new twist on violin music a chance.<br /><br />And Lindsey, please come up with more new and wonderful songs!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I get to see friends and relatives I have not seen in years because I live far away. Lots of fun. Everyone will love this game.

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|great story. cant wait for the next one. I really enjoyed the ending. good acting with lots of great effects
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|You might as well play a hidden object game on Facebook. You have to be connected to Wi-Fi. It's timed. I Absolutely hate games that allow you to run out of &quot;energy&quot;. This is one of those games. As far as graphics go, these are pretty good, but it doesn't make up for everything else. I don't understand why this app has such great reviews...
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|The music is great<br />The beats are great and I am really satisfied with the songs and the beats of the songs
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so obsessed with this site... I use it for craft inspiration. When I found out that there was an app for it that I could get for my Kindle Fire HD, I was super excited! I opened the app and logged in, and believe me, I was NOT disappointed. I actually prefer using Pinterest on my Kindle now.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app! It allows me to take notes on my phone or kindle and transfer them to my laptop. We've put our grocery list on it  and recipes.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Some episodes you just have to watch over and over.  So many good laughs and digs make you wonder if you want to hug Sheldon or kill him.  That is a sign of a great show.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this app is great if you like makeover games.  I have prinsess and fairy and mermaid of this game so get this app
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I found it quite useful, as opposed to previous apply. This has visual, audio, bookmarks, and several other benefits I haven't used as yet.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Did not meet expations!  After reading the first two books was really looking forward to the final installment in the triligy but was dissapointed.  Lots of dialog with limited action.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoy this book. The author is very good writer and the storyline was unique I really felt some many things when I read the end of this book. We as a human never forget, and is hard for us to forgive, although there is a deeply regret  for what we have done...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool beans. I loved it so much I wee myself slightly every time I get to the next level. Peace.
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  Once I started, I hated to put it down when I had to do something else.  This is so well-written, and such an engrossing story.  It keeps you guessing for a while, then you can't wait to see how things turn out.<br /><br />The writing is witty and brilliant.  One of my favorite lines reminds me of the way my sister and I talk, trying to be funny.  Nick is talking about a conversation he had with a police officer, where Nick had used the word &#34;scrapping,&#34; and Nick says to himself, mocking the cop, &#34;Scrapping?  What is this scrapping you speak of?&#34;  That just cracked me up.  Also, many of the pop culture references and movie quotes were a very nice touch.<br /><br />This is the first Gillian Flynn novel I have ever read, but it certainly won't be the last.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My daughter loves this band and this was a great gift for her! She listens to it all the time!
B007EECSFA|5.0|After a slow start, it quickly became a page turner, and ultimately had a completely surprising ending. Kate Morgan's style of writing, weaving past and present,  engulfing the reader in England during The Blitz, and siblings gathering together during the last days of their Mother's life, trying to unravel a mystery of her life. Well  worth reading!
0824835921|4.0|Excellent method, which allows the student to focus on the kanji in its entirity as opposed to individual strokes. This technique vastly improves editing and recall capabilities. Would have added the fith star had the author not handed over to the student, almost entirely, the responsibility to create their own stories later in the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's awesome I LOVE it. It's so addictive I can't stop myself from playing thanks so much.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great sound and picture on the blu-ray. Awesome colors are used during the battle scenes between the creatures and the machines. It's just a great Sci-Fi action film. And is a must have on blu-ray for any true Sci-fi fans
B001UN1KVE|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all times. The gift Mel Brooks displays in this masterful comedy is unparalleled. This is one of those movies that if people don't like it I have a really hard time believing they have a sense of humor.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|When founding guitarist and songwriter Peter Wichers first left Soilwork, fans felt that the music was lacking with his absence. With their first double allbum The Living Infinite, they obviously wanted to prove that he's no longer needed. I can't speak for the band, but his absence hasn't hindered their creativity. Most labels frown on putting out double albums because label politics dictate that average listeners don't take enough time to listen to the average album length which is between usually between 40-50 minutes. What most labels would do is put the albums out a disc at a time instead of all together. One exception is Symphony X's Iconoclast which technically is a double album thanks to the special edition release along with the regular single disc version. The Living Infinite comes standard as two CD's  with 84 minutes of melodic death metal in one package. What's cool is that there's nothing that differentiates between the discs music-wise so they don't feel like two different albums, they fit together well enough that you can listen to both from start to finish. It's flawless.
B000Q67876|5.0|Shawshank has always been one of my favorite films, and this package and disc are very well done. I would recommend this to any fan of the film, or especially to anyone that has never seen it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I read this already but read it again and it seems better this time round but that explains why Rowley has a girlfriend in Hard Luck
B0091THDOM|5.0|It securely holds my phone. I was also able to put three cards in the slot. I felt that the cards were protected. Just what I was looking for.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This app is awesome. I love it I will recommend it to all my friends. It is very very fun.
B00F0O8SZK|3.0|The first album by this artist is really hard to beat.  I don't know if it is the arrangements or what.  This is just ok .
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game. Great pass time. Very addicting. Its annoying to run out of lives and have to ask FB friends for help.
B009AMANBA|5.0|An outstanding movie that brought to life the full scope of all the Lincoln had to deal with during the Civil War.
B00EI4V3X2|1.0|I bought these at Gamestop for use with my PS4 and PC. I only used them on the PC before deciding to return them after tinkering with them for awhile and realizing the item is not up to par with my expectations for the price. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but definitely something much more than what I got. The sound (at both bandwidths) is plain average, and that is being very generous of me. I have a $50 old pair of stereo Sony headphones that I would prefer to use before these using these again. They have that subtle yet noticeable constant sound that I can only describe as the open mic hiss. I wouldn't go so far as to call it annoying, but I definitely would opt not to hear it. This is with the mic monitor turned to its lowest possible settings and all my PC mic monitoring settings being disabled as well. There are also the typical pops and crackles associated with lower quality headsets. on this particular issue, The Dude cannot abide. Aside from the extra noises, the sound quality itself is painfully average at best. Also, I would have to say the surround sound, while you can tell it works, doesn't feel like true surround sound (as far as headsets go.) The directionality is off. It's very apparent when playing an FPS game, which is about all I play anymore. I will say that I can tell the general direction of gunfire if I'm on the same plane as the shooter, but if you're listening for aircraft, all bets are off. Heli sound is very skewed. In the defense of TB, I've tried more than a couple headsets with surround sound, and this seems to be a common thread with sounds coming from high above.<br /><br />About the microphone, after reading reviews of other Turtle Beach headsets and many reviews stating that TB mics are pretty crappy, I can see where these people are coming from and totally agree. After adjusting settings on my computer and the headset, the mic still sounded like that of the old default half-headsets that shipped with the Xbox 360. Thesound is very poor quality.<br /><br />To give a reference to where my expectations lie, I use Sennheiser R170s for listening to music and watching TV/movies. I did not expect these to have the same sound quality because they're two different sets for different purposes. I also have a Creative Labs Wrath headset which I have been using for gaming since last Xmas. To me, their sound and mic quality is about what I expect from a gaming headset, nothing over the top, but definitely satisfactor, especially for the price which usually floats around the $100 mark. I chose to upgrade to these for two reasons. One, the Wrath would not be comparable with the PS4. And two, I have a pretty big head (I'm 6' 4\\") and the Wrath is NOT meant for larger heads. It hurts when I put them on, and only gets worse after hours binging on BF3/4 or Civ V. To the credit of the PX4s, they are pretty comfortable. I would not say they are as comfortable as my Sennheisers, but still a drastic improvement over the Wraths - I could see myself wearing these for extended periods of time without wanting to cry afterward (other qualities notwithstanding.)<br /><br />I was debating giving this product two stars, but frankly I'm getting sick and tired of these junk brands being lifted to esteem by what must be the next generation of gamers who are still spending their parents money and want something sleek looking and popular, because that is all this is. These is no eral quality of sound to be had here, just a popular brand with an appealing look. For that, the pragmatist in me would never allow a passing score.<br /><br />EDIT: I almost forgot, while I can chat wirelessly through the bluetooth capability on my PC, after some research it turns out I could not do so on the PS4. In order to chat with these on the PS4, you will still need need to wire the headset to the controller, rendering these not true wireless. Tsktsk
0553801473|4.0|Well I gave this four stars because I love the series.  I had bought the other books for my father, who was 86 and didn't have HBO at his house so he didn't even know about the story.  He came to live with me while he was sick with colon cancer and he had decided against any treatment.  I had HBO Go on my IPad so I caught him up on the previous seasons he had missed.  The series was on hiatus at the time.  He loved it as I knew he would because he loved Sci Fi.  My father was an avid reader and his only complaint about the books wasn't really a negative; he said &#34;boy there are very strange names, so many families that it is hard to keep track of.&#34;  Knowing my father though it didn't take him long to sort it all out so when he would talk about the book he spoke of the characters by name.  His health deteriorated quickly but  he decided to buy this book any way.  I didn't know, and I'm sure he wasn't aware that he was ordering a hardcover book and that it would be so heavy.  Needless to say he couldn't hold the book up to read and as he was slipping away more each day I would try to read it to him but he was in and out of consciousness.  He said to me one day, &#34;I know I won't be able to finish this book&#34; and he was right he passed away shortly after.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think the game is fun and it is free when you download but after you download you either have to get new lives from facebook or pay 99 cents to continue.  I am not on facebook and never have been so I think that is a discrimination in itself.  Also very misleading asking for money after saying the game was free.  True you do not have to pay but they make it tough to continue if you do not pay.  Very dishonest as far as I am concerned.  Should say upfront that the game is actually not a free game.
B00G32OER4|5.0|wow, without the need of getting too graphic the director manages to deliver a film that will spook you good without the need of getting sick minded! Have been wishing something as good as this for a long time!
B00471JSR4|4.0|Cool movie, Just bought it because of the visual effects but it ended being very interesting. Will there be a sequel?
B001FAFO3W|5.0|I am so happy I found this dvd on Amazon. I've loved this movie ever since I can remember. The cover art is bad, but thats not due to the seller, it has always looked kind of bad. Brand new with the dvd seal still on it
1455525839|4.0|I listen to audiobooks and this was no exception. Sigh...I am a Pendergast fan from Still Life<br />with Crows but have been disappointed with the past 3-4 books. To me, Pendergast is better served up solving macabre crimes and the series has gotten away from that until this book. I enjoyed the Doyle and Wilde conversations and the story that Doyle never published. The basic plot was interesting and it was a good locale. Here comes my dislikes 1) How could an experienced criminal justice student make such stupid decisions based on juvenile resentment of authority  2) I knew one bad guy early on 3) The newly introduced female character seemed pretty shallow and disappeared a lot in the story then pops up at the right time . I found Corrie almost unlikeable.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Brand new and still in the store packaging. I haven&#34;t opened it yet. Cant wait to watch it when my child opens it for christmas
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's just like the movie. Could have more upgrades and combos....but it's still fun. Good selection of bots to fight with. You might get addicted if you enjoy building and fighting.
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this movie last night and I thought it was good. In fact I liked it so much I'm going to the movies to see the 2nd one later on this week. It was nice to see a lot of familiar actors in it like Jennifer Lawrence, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harrelson, and Josh Huncherson. I received this movie pretty quick in the mail.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|First of all, I just want to say that this book is very well written.  The characters are rich and well-drawn.  But I am one of those people who need to be in love with their characters, and I just was not in love with any of them.  Especially Theo - I just wanted to shake him and ask, &#34;What are you thinking?!&#34;  Awful, terrible things happen in everyday life - but it is up to YOU to create your destiny!  The entire book, he's following everyone else's lead - and ends up doing ridiculously dumb things, and goes through life like he's waiting for someone to give him a happy ending.  Even at the end, when he's cheated on, he doesn't fight for his relationship - it's &#34;Ho hum.&#34;  Are you serious?!  Get rid of her, or keep her!  UGH!  Well-written book for sure, but if you're looking for lovable characters, look somewhere else.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Simple. Enter Rick Rubin to the production side.Wow! I was gonna get this album anyways, but seeing Rick Rubin was involved i bought it instantly! Enough said.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Vic Mackey kills his &#34;brother&#34; but his troubles are just beginning.  It's a reinvention of Hamlet, and it is a masterpiece.
3795753384|5.0|This vocal score of the &#34;Carmina&#34; is excellent because it provides all the parts of the Sopranos, Altos, Tenors, and Basses. In addition all of the solo parts, children's chorus, and orchestral interludes are included, making it easy to follow. I would recommend this printing for anyone who will be performing the &#34;Carmina Burana&#34;. My use of this vocal score marks my third performance of it and I purchased this a second time for a friend and fellow singer who will be singing it for the first time. This is the only printing of this work that anyone should consider for performnce.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Delightful innocence of the narrator. Hysterically funny in so many places - I laughed out loud.<br />Such a range of characters - some so satirically treated. You could recognise people you had worked<br />with or known. A happy ending!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of the best games I've ever played sssssssssssssssssssoooooooooooooooo gggggggggggggoooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddd better than other games. It's so stupid what kind of hunting games amazon has.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|better then I thought. great as a matter of fact. I like their sound. almost as good as the first - this is it !!!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Jean Reno has never been better. Natalie Portman's best performance. She's been up to par in other films, but at her level here, and the fact she was a child. Come on. No contest. And, the single greatest scenery-chewing performance from my favorite actor of all time. I so wish I could get one of my scripts produced with Gary Oldman playing one of the characters, before he retires. This is a love story, an action story, a comedy and fable even. The likability is just through the roof.<br />You think of any movie involving an assassin, about an assassin, any of it. This one trumps it. There's just no comparison. Even given the controversial undertones in the American version from the original, it remains just as great. The screenplay even went further than that. It probably would have derailed this modern fairytale. One original piece of work that I believe deserves a sequel, and could even tell just as great a story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some levels are completed in one try &amp; others take 50+. I find it a simple game with complex aspects. I was turned on to Candy Crush by other seniors who play.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I like the book very much. The ending, while sad, is a realistic conclusion that reflects the turmoil of their society. I also like the story being told by both Tris and Four although telling them apart is confusing at times. Each &#34; voice&#34; is not as distinct as it should be and that is why I rate it with four stars instead of five.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Galaxy Quest was a fun romp with just enough to poke a little fun at a science fiction TV-Movies series some take way to seriously.<br />Of course it had the typical hero saves the day finish but not before the required epiphany which turned the coward into the hero. Yes it is the same story line over again but it does it with enough laughs so that it can be forgiven. Got some spare time, want to laugh, I would recommend it.
B00354YA2M|5.0|Perceptive, incisive and always funny. It's more than a travel book but also a surprisingly accurate intelligent observer's survey of Australian culture.  Bill Bryson has captured the essence of the country.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I do like the Bubble Witch for Kindle.  I just wish there was more space for the balls to bounce.  Thanks for the development of this favorite game of mine
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is unique. I would not normally play games with candy. However, this is an exception. Plus, this is a game ALL of YOU should get now.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It works well on kindle fire, it's fun an able to b played without buying thing lol as some games we all no don't work that way this one has the option buy plays well with out
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This series started slow, but built into a wild ride.  It's really hard not to pull an all- nighter and watch all the episodes to see how the season finishes.  The acting is great and the storyline attention-holding.  Too bad it's not still on the air.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Very quick read.  Good for book clubs.  Not much thought needed to go into the read, that is why I did not rate it higher.  But for bookclubs sometimes you want a read that is not too complicated in structure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded this for my 8 year old....it's is so great we have it on both kindled and all 4 phones. It's great although the only negative thing I can say is on the kindle you don't get the updates for weeks so that's frustrating. Great for all ages!!! We ALL play it
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Though some may point out that this book is amateurishly written, I personally feel that the fact that this book was written solely by Ms. Dugard serves as an added authenticity bonus to the reader.  It may not be literary art, but it is art in its roughness.<br /><br />I'm not a sexual abuse survivor, but I am an abuse survivor and I think this account of her thoughts and feelings throughout her ordeal serve as an invaluable tool to other sufferers.  Sometimes just to be able to identify with someone else makes it easier to trudge through situations we can't control or understand.  This book helped me heal and make sense of some of my own feelings of compassion toward my abuser, and to understand why, at times, I protected him.  Like Jaycee's, my sense of &#34;normal&#34; became skewed and I too confused my abuser's controlling behavior with love.<br /><br />This book is not a sensationalized account of her experience; it's an authentic, unpolished, raw account of sexual and emotional abuse that digs deep into the trials of a very strong, resilient young woman.  I admire her courage to be so candid and transparent, and for this I gave five stars.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was like a train at first..slow going until it got up steam! It was an enjoyable read, once I got into it! Especially liked the &#34;Epilogue&#34; - all the what if's were cleverly put together.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author has so much talent, but the story line itself was too dark. There were no sympathetic characters whatsoever, and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. I realize this is done on purpose, but it isn't so riveting when you hope the person dies!I read till the end just to see - that was even more dissapointing, but quite in line with the theme of the book. I guess I just need good guys and bad guys!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's simple but you have to plan what your moves are going to be.  It is more fun than I thought and can see how folks get addicted to playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game for my daughter for a trip we are taking to Florida.  Both her and my wife are addicted to minions!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Only wished it had more levels.  Free version isn't long enough. Guess they r to cheap 4 that tho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Better luck next time
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Did not see then ending of this novel coming! I was totally surprised! A stranger on a flight home from vacation recommended this story to me as one she could not put down. While it took me a while to get into, once I did, I wanted to know the truth. Good read and it really makes you think about what you would do if faced with the situation at hand.
140006922X|1.0|Superficial.  I'm not a christian but this work appeared to be sloppy historical writing.  I would not expect such statements as &#34;Of course he could not  have  been literate on account of poor upbringing&#34; .  What is this &#34;of course&#34; mean without any justification?
0743243153|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time.  I have read the book many times and always come away with a new way of viewing life.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|The title for this concert was perfect. An amazing, seemingly unending, documentary that you'll want to see over and over. You may also want the album.
B00DI5DPE2|5.0|SACD version of &#34;Brothers In Arms&#34; sounds better than I ever remember. The original vinyl version I have sounds good but this blows it away for sure. If you have a SACD player this will sound amazing!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Not a bad price for the complete anthology of Sherlock Holmes's adventures.  I read them all when I was in high school and never tire of re-reading them.  Now that I have them all on my Kindle, I can read them at my leisure, especially on a cold and dark stormy night.
B004TI5N38|5.0|PULLER IS A MAKE OVER OF LEE CHILD's JACK REACHER.  STILL A GOOD READ THOUGH.  WOULD LIKE TO SEE PULLER IN A SERIES.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was worth a 99 cent rental.  The video stream worked well. The movie ending implied a sequel.  I am not sure that would work.
B001EPIIMC|4.0|Very pleased with the front cover and the vinyl itself is in great condition with hardly a scratch but the inside of the cover art is ripped about ⅓ off so thats kinda disappointing but since i didn't buy this for the inside cover it doesn't make that big of a difference to me. overall i am pleased with my purchase
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great mystery with an incredible twist!  This story is a page turner and will keep you guessing as to &#34;who did it&#34;.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love littlest pet shop I do not know any way it can gaiety better than it is right now.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Fantastic story.  I got to chapter 5 and realized I had seen the movie from the 1980's.  The book AND the movie are great!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I really like this movie, much better than anticipated. Brad Pitt shows unexpected depth and I like the mystery angle.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Great story about an intelligent and gifted person who changed the technical world forever. This story brought out highlights on Jobs' life as well as telling the reader about his personal failures and his difficulties with other humans.  Mr. Jobs was not an easy person to like and not easy to get along with in the work place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely a ton of fun.  Very addictive, I wish I&acute;d found the game sooner. Glad there are so many more levels.
B000FCK65W|3.0|A story about life in Brooklyn, NY through the eyes of a young girl.  A coming of age story.  The story is entertaining, but there is no suspense, mystery, romance, or other major themes in this story.  It is a glimpse of life in the days where there was not much money for many and people making ends meet and just surviving.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|One of my favorite go yo movies. Thor was my favorite comic book read. No, not a deep plot, just good vs evil.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A good intriguing story about a young couple who fall in love around the mystery of a traveling circus. Great read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Recipes and more with friends and family. Easy to use from most websites. Get it today. I think I have enough words.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very intense and heart wrenching read for any parent. It is always a parents worst nightmare when their child is falsely accused of doing wrong and put under arrest.  But this story takes it a step further in which one parent doubts their child's innocents, and another parent totally believes in their child's innocents.
0061992860|5.0|Compact sized book with a lot of information needed for survival. Has some pictures in it as well. I recommend covering it in plastic for preservation purposes.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice graphics, easy to play. I recommend this game for hunters or anyone that wants to pass the time while dreaming of hunting
B00006FDCD|4.0|I HATE CLOWNS!  But Pennywise is not a real clown.  Just watch it if you haven't and draw your own conclusion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's mentally challenging enough that it isn't boring, yet easy enough to give instant gratification to those who may need enough success to stay interested.  A good way to entertain myself in small downtime moments.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Amazing story. Very well written book and a must read.  The book takes you back to 19th century when the battles between Tesla and Edison were at their peak.  Excellent.  Also, it is short so you get the gist in less than 30 mins the life and works of great Tesla.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just love being able to play solitaire on the go. No table needed,  just a pocket big enough to carry my kindle fire. Works perfectly well in the wind, too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. It really got stimulated my logical thinking. I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles and figure things out.
0307352153|4.0|Not quite a classic.  It made me feel justified when I decline offers to go out when I'd rather stay home.  I passed it on to an extroverted friend who is puzzled by her introverted son.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|simply put , the movie was great, our grandchildren absoluty loved it. After watching it once we went out and bought it .
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I am giving this a one because it claims to be &#34;free&#34; and then you have to pay to keep playing.  The game itself is very fun, but it is beyond frustrating to be playing and every few minutes a clock pops up and says you have 20 or 30 minutes to wait until you can play again....or pay 99 cents to keep playing for a few extra minutes.  SO DAMN FRUSTRATING!!!  I will be deleting this game.
B005R32L66|3.0|only works good if you have a really fast connection....which not everyone has.... but getting better as fasdter connections for those of us out in the country get better service from telephone and satilite providers...
B009R5GR1K|5.0|A hugely impressive and comprehensive work. Before discovering this app I had downloaded individual dictionaries. This is a far more useful tool and wonderful for those fascinated by words and other languages.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Great movie, super cute, great story line, both my kids (4 and 2) really like it. Hope they make a sequel.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This one works in many areas.  It's got Sci-fy, struggles with family, and a current love story.  A good one.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Actually my five year old granddaughter watches this movie every time I am at her house with my Kindle.  She loves it as does Grammie.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Mission impossible is a great group of movies.  But I really enjoyed this one particularly well.  Add this one to your library.
B00FQUACUM|5.0|O my God. I have been following these young man since the first time I seen them on PBS. Remarkable...
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is so much fun. I haven't played a more fun game for years. Thanks metro trains for making this app!
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|This book sounded awesome and I was really excited to try these experiments. But I read a third of this &#34;book&#34; and haven't made it to the experiments yet. All I keep reading is how awesome they are.<br /><br />I stopped reading this book because of the ignorant references to my Christian God. I just wanted to try these experiments. Instead I got an amateur anti-Christian blog. I bet Pam Grout is amazed that someone who believes in God is smart enough to get online and write a review.<br /><br />I was especially disappointed because this book came from Louise Hay House. I used to like Louise Hay but I didn't realize she had such a low opinion of Christians.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best free apps out on the market. Loads of challenges to complete and plenty of item/costumes to get.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book is imaginative and a quick read.  It even made me think/ wonder about what we are here for - our purpose, and what do we/ I want to really do with my time.  Additionally, some of the moments in the book were very touching and brought tears to my eyes.  The bottom line is that Albom accomplished a lot in writing this book.  However, none of the characters, including the two main characters in the book, are not fully developed so for me  an important ingredient was lacking and I was disappointed.  Similarly, this book is relatively short compared to most of the books that I've read. The author developed an idea enough that the reader was entertained for awhile and could understand it and mull it over, but the characters were kind of flimsy and two-dimensional, so something was flat.  Like a dinner at a really good restaurant that one looks forward to and the external setting is good, but the food is just OK, rather than super.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Absolutely fantastic concert with Eagles performing at their very best. The DVD is a marvel in Sound Engineering and Camera work.
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|nice Interesting ending is like any other suspense movie left hanging but otherwise it good, the start cast is also nice
B00CA4S27W|5.0|&#34;Dancer and the Moon&#34; is a fabulous recording. I feel it is the finest and most fully realized work by Blackmore's Night. The songwriting is quite good throughout and the performances are great. Candice Night has never sounded better, as her voice has attained a confidence and a deep sonic richness. And, thankfully, there is plenty of gorgeous electric guitar from the man in black. I also love the cool church organ added to much of the material. The production in general is much more organic and stripped down...this is a fortunate transition away from the liberal use of reverb on their earlier recordings; this has been a welcome change on the last few records. Ritchie's acoustic guitar shimmers and is especially clean and chiming.<br /><br />&#34;Lady in Black&#34; is at the top of the heap amongst the band's cover tunes. It is a perfect and quite obvious tune for the band. I love Uriah Heep's original and Blackmore's Night gives it a lovely and respectful reading. I also adore their reinterpretation of the Rainbow classic &#34;Temple of the King&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;The Moon is Shining&#34; is closest that Blackmore's Night has to come to fashioning a genuine Rainbow tune...it could have been a Rainbow song in any era. Again, Candice sounds better than ever. Blackmore burns brilliantly all over the outro. &#34;Galliard&#34; is another in a long line of great Blackmore acoustic instrumentals.<br /><br />This record, more than any previous release by the band, fills me with anticipation for another Blackmore's Night release. Long live Ritchie Blackmore!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is an addictive game. Wish there were more levels to play. Hoping Playrix will upgrade it. I love the PC version too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Could use mine carts to speed up travel but anyway this is a great game. Keep the updates coming. And if you see a name tag saying Navy dog12 that's me
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|not as good as the first movie. Got tedious to watch. I had a hard time staying interested related to believe ability.
B00699G4LK|5.0|Excellent vinyl treatment of a modern classic. The master on this sounds great and the layout/packaging is high-quality. Hopefully A Light In the Attic gives the same treatment to the whole Morphine catalog!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved loved loved it!! It's so amazingly written and I just can't even put in words how beautiful this book is!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|In the beginning I was distracted by the way in which the story went from a story to the bold print but the more I read the more I got used to the switches.  What an incredible story!  It's well written and I enjoyed it so much!  If you give it even half a chance you will too!  Be prepared for a wonderful adventure!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Great flick, very exciting!  Cool effects, plot line is a little sketchy and disjointed though.  Overall, I'd recommend it!  Check it out!!
B00E9P959O|5.0|If you are a Rush fan like myself, you may have always thought that the mixing in the original Vapor Trails release was muddy and rather ugly. This remixed version is what Vapor Trails should have always been. It's clear. The songs pop and have a new dimension to them. I am so glad that guys never gave up on this album and had it redone after all these years. AWESOME!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Honestly cannot figure out the relentless bashing this film got. Just watched it and was pleasantly surprised. I was entertained with a good story and it held my attention. Some of the folks that reviewed it could not be more off base. I think it's M Night's best effort in some time. The flashbacks were well done, acting was fine and it flowed well. I think it's movies like this one that often lead me to ignore the advice of others and just see it for myself and make up my own mind. The reviews that people wrote about this one are reminiscent of Waterworld and the Postman back in the 90s; both of these despised by large numbers of snobbish critics but I enjoyed them a great deal. Hardly the mindless drivel that hordes of antagonists labeled it. Nice work on a good piece of entertainment.
B003G4W49C|5.0|OSC writes as if telling a bedtime story, making all very simple to follow, but instead of a boring tale he comes with mature developed characters and a plot you canno't stop reading.<br /><br />Recommended for all ages.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It doesn't live up to the hype. It's just like every other match game. Doesn't take a lot of thought or concentration.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|ok the ending was not the best way to end a book. i think it was by far as good asthe first books. the other reviews get way to techanical come on the book has avery good plot and is well thought out. if you liked the first two books your going to love this one too.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It has violence.  But it is the best. It is fun. You can have allies. So have fun play the game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I assume was good my children play it on my Kindle. Have not heard any complaints. All I have to say.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|All star cast, great script, great acting, and director.  I don't know what else to say except you won't be sorry for watching this feel good, funny movie.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Bought this for my toddlers. When the car crashes the drivers neck breaks and makes a very graphic crunch sound. The drivers head snaps way back. Its difficult to watch. Gross.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|An unusual love story with vivid characters I haven't forgotten. A tender ,funny,heartbreaking story. JoJo Moyey has showed us behavior of two people in love ,giving the ultimate sacrifice.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thought it was promising until she gave it a truly terrible ending.  I'm so thoroughly distraught that I probably will not go to see the movie of Divergent when it comes out.  I will certainly not recommend the series to any of the young adult group that uses the library where I work parttime.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love the detail in the descriptions!  The depth of intrigue keeps me reading late into the night.  It has been a while since I have journeyed with Kay so it was a nice reunion.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good post-apocolyptic novel. I just wish Howey would quit doing the serial stories and write a complete book and follow-up novels. They are well written and plausible, however.
0316172324|5.0|I love this author.  Got the books on tape and reread in bed at night to go over it or move ahead.  I would love to meet this guy, he articulates and backs up his ideas.
0812550706|5.0|Wow - great book! I had not heard of this author before the movie came out, and my kid wanted to see it. WHen I found out that the book is famous and influential I wanted to read it before I saw the film, and I'm sure glad I did - it's much better! While the film rushes through Ender's training, the book dwells on it and really brings the refinement of Ender's military genius to life (the film takes it for granted). The sub-plot of the political development of Peter Wiggins is a bit of a distraction, although I do like the idea that all three of the Wiggins children are exceptional (imagine, for example, that Napoleon's brother and sister shone nearly as brightly as he did). But, we can't all be Baldwins…<br /><br />Nice twist at the ending too! Even the denouement chapter is good!! A great book also for kids, especially talented kids - this demonstrates what could happen if they're taken seriously. It also up-ends the flaw in the Harry Potter series where we always wonder where most of the adult wizards are when the final battle with Voldemort takes place, and why they're generally so useless. In this book, kids are prized for their unpolluted thinking. As they should be!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This is a really good book! Although the storyline is similar to Cinderella, it's nothing like it. Cinder it's a really smart and strong character, not a damsel in distress at all. I love it!!!
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|Good action, but not much else, my wife and I thought a lot of the scenes looked fake, and the story was wholly unbelievable.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink did it again! Fantastic music. I love it when you buy a CD and you like ALL the music on it and don't have to skip over songs. There is not a single song on this CD that I don't like. The first time listening to the whole CD, I fell in love.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Good remake, update, of original Superman movie. Slow, prodding, for at least half the movie but then action begins and effects are spectacular. Family movie? Yes, as limited language and blood violence. Date movie? Sure. View with significant other? Yes. Final note. While this played in theaters some talk about parallels to story of Christ. Well I just don't see it and think it was a real stretch and pure marketing ploy.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|All the James Bond movies these days are beautifully acted, but all of them are also shamelessly over the top in their action scenes and loud enough to drown out a 747. Entertaining, but vanishes without a trace after the final credits.
B009GFEOY8|3.0|WARNING: If you are looking at the white box of SX-70 film, DO NOT BUY IT. Impossible has released a new, improved batch that comes in a black box, that is more stable and with faster development times. You can find this at their official website (Google \\"Impossible Project\\"). The white boxes will now be sold at even more inflated prices, by third party sellers. The newer film is called SX-70 (rather than PX-70), and the logo/name is on a black box on a white background, rather than on an all-white background.    THE FILM ITSELF    Impossible film, this is not. After having taken 16 pictures (you may scoff, but that's $50!), I wouldn't call any of them total duds-- any mistakes could be blamed more on me than the film itself. Always keep these extremely important tips in mind:    - SET YOUR EXPOSURE DIAL: Start your SX-70's exposure dial from the darkest setting, and work your way up. I've never had to go past the middle point, actually. You will probably never have to set the dial to the brightest setting. Indoors, darkest/ second-darkest did the trick, while outside in the day it was anywhere from second darkest to least dark. Not sure yet about night shots.    - SHIELD YOUR POLAROIDS: Immediately turn your camera upside down the moment it spits the camera out, or shield your hand over it, or install the [[ASIN:B005KEY0TS Impossible Frog Tongue]]. Any light hitting the picture in its first few minutes will dramatically affect the exposure.    - DEVELOP PROPERLY: Polaroids should develop face-down in a dark, warm place (the darkness is the most important part, warmth is optional but helpful.), NEVER in direct sunlight or lamp-light. DO NOT SHAKE THEM! These babies take about half an hour to even start taking shape, and an hour to fully develop. Keep it face-down that whole time!    Warmth eliminates a slight blue tinge. It won't be so dramatic that your friend will comment \\"Wow, this picture is blue!\\" But there will be a slight blue filter look to it. If it's TOO warm, like you're developing it outside on a 90-degree day, expect an orange tinge.    - STORE PROPERLY: Put film packs in the fridge and make sure they stay dry. Let them return to room temperature (for at least an hour) before use.    Yes, this film is very fickle, but if you follow these rules you will be getting pretty consistent results. There's still a long way to go for the Impossible Project. Here's a quick rundown:    PROS  - Beautiful colors and contrast-- vintage Polaroid look captured very well  - Larger than the Fujifilm Instax 8 (3\\" x 4\\" compared to 3\\" x 2\\")  - Sturdy, less flimsy than Fujifilm instant photos    CONS  - Price-- $3 a shot (theoretically $4 if you use disposable flashbars)  - Long development times-- over an hour, compared to 10ish minutes for Fujifilm  - Tendency to be overexposed-- your camera's exposure dial must (almost) always be in the dark range to compensate  - Extremely sensitive to light during development stage      SO HOW DO POLAROIDS COMPARE TO FUJIFILM?    Fujifilm is the only other major manufacturer of instant cameras on the market. They're more successors than competitors, but it's only natural that there's a big divide in the instant photography community over this.    AVAILABILITY  Since this film is specifically for the SX-70 series, I won't have to mention the Polaroid 300 or Z2300. Polaroids are vintage items, so they will be much harder to find, in a much wider variety of conditions than the [[ASIN:B00AWKJPPY Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (White)]] and [[ASIN:B002NUP0D2 Fujifilm INSTAX 210 Instant Photo Camera]]. They WILL however, be about the same price-- box-type SX-70s are going for around $60 these days while the folding SX-70s go for around $120. You should know this going in. My only tips are to make sure that the camera you're buying has been film tested, and also to look on more places than just Amazon to buy a camera.    PHOTOGRAPHY  If you're a serious lomographer, then you want the [[ASIN:B003K1EL2E Polaroid SX-70 Alpha Instant Folding Camera]]. It's an SLR, meaning what you see through the viewfinder is exactly what you get, and you can manually focus it. Back in the day, this was the choice for professional Polaroid photographers. No Fujifilm Instax compares.  If you just want pictures for memories and for fun, then you want the [[ASIN:B003K1M9YG Polaroid OneStep SX-70 White/Rainbow Camera]]. This camera was for people who just wanted snapshots. However, there are several other factors to consider...    EASE OF USE  Fujifilm wins, plain and simple. Fujifilm has captured that instant magic, with photos that takes less than half an hour to develop. Furthermore, their film is nowhere near as sensitive and unstable as Impossible is. If you want instant photography AND the experience of using an authentically vintage piece of machinery, then go Polaroid. If you just want instant photography with no hassles and you don't care about any vintage-ness, go with the Fujifilm. If you do end up choosing the Polaroid, I encourage you to look at blogs, how-tos, etc. and avoid making any rookie mistakes.    PRICE  Fujifilm is also the clear winner here. At $3 a shot, Polaroids are triple the price of Fujifilm's nice-and-easy $1 a shot. The Fujifilm cameras also come with built-in flashes, while the SX-70s do not. You have to either buy disposable flash bars (10 flashes per bar, $10 per bar) or a electronic flash attachment (one-time purchase around $30), which also factor into the cost.    SUMMARY  It's like the choice between a 2013 Honda or a 1967 Beetle. Polaroids provide an experience that is unmatched by modern instant cameras, but of course require a lot more investment, care, and patience. They're fun in a different way, and much more charming. But who knows? Polaroids may not be right for everyone. People like me, though, love the feeling of driving in a Beetle and would take it over the Honda any day.    NOTE: Polaroid cameras are powered by batteries thatare INSIDE the film pack. Thus, each pack provides both film AND powers the camera. This also factors into the price of each individual film pack. The batteries cannot be taken out. In contrast, Fujifilm uses normal batteries (AA) sold separately.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I loved reading this book! Absolutely couldn't put it down until I finished it, then I wanted to read it again :)

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It is one of the most realistic games ever. I love the free updates, and its for a good price
0723259674|5.0|Absolutely wonderful set! This is the first time I have ever been so pleased with a product, I wanted to leave a review.  I love that this is the complete set of Beatrix Potter's books. And all the beautiful illustrations that I remember from when I was a child.... I wanted to dive in and read them again! There is an illustration or two on virtually every page. These books are produced with a nice hardcover, and they have used a quality paper on the interior pages. If I were a young child, I would go gaga over this.  We bought two sets, one each for two nieces that just had a baby.... I'm glad that they will be able to grow up with these wonderful stories like I had. Highly recommend.
B00F8GYC1Y|2.0|I just wanted to try some angry birds game for my kindle and got this one because of star wars however the only thing I could say I liked was the sound of the birds once dead. As far as I am  concerned I won't repeat, this is not for me.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very challenging to obtain all 3 stars at each level.  As with other free games, you begin to understand the process and then the game ends.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This is so cute, I love it!!! I could literally do this all day lol, but it's really great for the little ones though.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Interesting story.  Hard to believe this lady's guts and foolishness at the same time.  Easy read and good discussion for my womens a book club.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Make posting to ebay easier and faster in most cases.  Easy to keep up with bidding also.  Wish I had done this sooner
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good game I recommend getting this<br />It is fun and free, the graphics never let you down.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Been a long time since I read the series. Glad I came back its what science fiction should be. No way should it be missed!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|yay finally got it on my kindle.I love this game. I'm also glad it was all saved on facebook now I don't have to start over.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I would have liked to play this game, being the iron man fan that I am but after the initial download the game needed to download almost 800 extra mg to work, and at the rate it was downloading my great grandkids still wouldn't have been able to play it! don't know if it's my internet connection or what, but I gave up after 3 or 4 hours! Not happy.....
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It isn't so often that I find a book to read and can't put it down...especially one as long as this one.  The storyline reminds me of Dickens, with some Wim Wenders and Herzog thrown in.  It is so strikingly visual (like a painting) that it would make a great movie.  I can see Adam Driver being in one of the roles.  I am sure the book has been optioned for a movie by now...but if not, someone should grab it.  Every time I thought the book was going to end (I read on a Kindle, so had no idea of page numbers), it just kept going...feeding my hunger to find out more.  It is an interesting story...something a dark storyteller would tell...with many plot twists and turns.  It is well worth the time...a book to sit with during a holiday week, when it is cold and snowing outside...
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thank you for a pleasantly fun read full of insight and guidance.  This book lifted me up!  I think I will order some copies for friends.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I adore this film!!! it's my 2nd favorite and I know every single song in it!! If you love Disney and musicals you should buy this DVD because it has amazing special features!!
B001993Y2C|5.0|I can't believe that I forgot to rate this purchase. This was one of the best series ever, and to be able to rewatch it in hi-def is outstanding. The special effects are so great and even better on blue ray. This was also such a good buy, I jumped on it even though I had all the seasons on regular DVD.
B0001I561E|5.0|This is my favorite Disney movie EVER!!! I love every single song! it's just incredible!!!!  I highly recomend buying it since it has cool special features!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Love the game but  $4.99 I will have to think about before I buy !  G5 have come out with some great games and this is one of them.
B00006FRZA|5.0|I really like this film!!! I saw it a long time ago and it's just Sophie Marceau's best movie for sure!!! and the story is amazing!! I'm glad to have in my collection now :)

B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|Wasn't sure if I was going to like this album or not. I enjoy the few Volbeat tracks that I hear on the radio and thought I'd give this one a try. It's turned into one of my favorite &#34;work in the garage albums&#34;. I crank up the volume and put this CD on and throughly enjoy working on projects while listening to this album.
B001V7YJMG|2.0|If you enjoyed this review, check out my horror blog at: brandoncsites.blogspot.com<br /><br />Let the Right One In (2008) **<br />D: Tomas Alfedson<br />C: Kare Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar, Henrik Dahl<br />P: An odd young boy befriends a young girl that has moved into the same apartment complex as him. Over time, he slowly begins to realize that she is a vampire.<br /><br />The central plot line involves two odd, weird characters that society has shunned away coming together and finding friendship and mutual understanding with one another. While the performances from its two young leads are competent as stand alone performances, the two young actors fail to find a flow with one another. They fail to ignite chemistry with one another. They just don't feed off of one another. People, who get one another or are friends with one another, have that innate understanding between one another and its just not here with the young actors of Let the Right One In. Since friendship and understanding is a key component to the film's story and the actors fail to convince viewers of that, the film's overall scenario isn't fully engaging.<br /><br />There’s a sub-plot involving school bullies terrorizing one of the main characters. These scenes are dynamic, suspenseful, even chilling. These scenes come alive with energy and urgency. The problem is, it's a sub-plot and it's far more interesting then the main plot thread. While the film's initial concept is intriguing, Let the Right One In drags far too often until it gets to a scene involving these bullies confronting our main character. Let the Right One In touches upon a universal theme in its exploration of companionship, but the material, surprisingly, doesn't resonate because of actors who just don't connect with one another and a sub-plot that's far more exciting then the central storyline.

B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|This album sounds like Korn is going back to their roots, definitely somewhere between Untouchables and Take a look in the Mirror for the sound. Much better than the last few albums they released. I would recommend that anyone who enjoyed the first 5 Korn albums take a listen to this one and see what they think.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|I give any movie four stars that I can watch at least five times... I've watch, &#34;Equilibrium&#34; four times already and will definitely watch it before the end of this month.

B004L9MFM2|4.0|Enthralling piece of writing and very atmospheric. George R.R. Martin has me hooked. I love the way his huge cast of characters crosses paths and the insight he gives into his characters and their actions

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Its a pretty fun game that both me and my boyfriend enjoy playing. No glitches or problems with the game so far and we have been playing it for about a month now. It works fine on kindle fire, windows 8 computers, and smart phones, absolutely no problems.

0061733199|5.0|Great book! It provided me with the information that I was looking for and is an easy read. Not every book has all of the information that you may need, but it is definitely a good start.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, however, it is research heavy. If you are looking for a book that will tell you how to be rich, this book has a great message but it is not a how to guide.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game so much I can not get off it ! If you don't have this game you need to give it a try!
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|The movie takes a fresh look at the beginnings of the man of steel. It also puts a slightly different spin on Zod, and his exile and ultimate &#34;search&#34; for the Krypton child. It is also interesting to note the paranoia that grips the U.S. when the man of steel surfaces. I rated the movie 4 stars because it is entertaining and enjoyable. It will keep you interested for the entire 2+ hours.
B0055S348W|5.0|I got this app for free, and it works great! It automatically finds nearby printers, and prints to them more reliably than my Windows 7 laptop. Other apps like this one that I've tried only work if you (a) have a very new printer, (b) have a very specific brand of printer, or (c) install special software on your computer. I'm happy to say that this app has none of these restrictions, and works fine with both my Brother and HP printer. As others have mentioned, it renders a tad slowly at times, but it handles lots of document types, so overall I'm quite impressed!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter.  she likes to play on my kindle when she comes to visit.  She absolutely loves it. Its fun to play and challenges her too.  After she left my house the day we got it, I thought I would give it a try.  Now I'M addicted!!!  this is a really fun game!  simple to understand, but increasingly challenging.  I enjoy it myself.  I also like the feature where if you get stuck on a level and just cant seem to be it, it makes you take a break..gather your wits. This really helps to keep my granddaughter from getting so frustrated.  I think that was a brilliant feature of the game to help maintain the players self esteem.
B000SEI230|2.0|I have read all of the Nicholas Sparks books and I was very disappointed in this one. I found it slow moving and uninteresting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 10 year old daughter and I read this book together and she loved it as well.  While reading it, I asked her questions about how she would react to some of the situations that took place.. especially with reading about how peers treated the main character in the book.  It is such a great book in regards to humanity and being kind.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|This book explains just how much narcissism Jeff has, how  he treats  people and what he will do to get his way.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Watched this movie once.  This isn't fiction.  Don't let the men in suits lie to you.  I can bend spoons now.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The trilogy of Veronica Roth's Divergent, Insurgent, Allegiant books keep you on the edge of your seat as you read. The characters are well developed and stay interesting throughout. The plot lines are exciting and surprising, keeping you coming back for more. Although Allegiant has only been available for less than a month, I am on my second read of all three books. Allegiant contains one surprise after another including a surprising conclusion. Excellent story all the way through.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|I have never went to a live show and been disappointed.  The guitar work is second to none and these guys are true performers.  As much as I have always enjoyed the original recordings I have always wanted to have the live show on my playlist.  They are more raw and not as over processed as they are in studio and this is where they shine--  When they strip it all back for live performances.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Just what I ordered, works fine, good price for a new gamecube controller and the white color look awesome. Love playing with it.
B00FHB7398|5.0|This is another winner from Big Fish Games with lots of mini -games that are not too complicated but should you get stuck, there is a Skip option available. There's also plenty of hidden object scenes for those that enjoy them and for those that can do without them, they're not all that bad. I personally, don't mind these type where you need to do certain things to actually find the objects. It's better than blindly tapping the screen until you find them. Another plus..for me anyway.....there is no penalty for tapping too many times.<br />I really enjoyed the interaction with the characters. It was different than I'm accustomed to. Although, the audio or narration seemed a bit choppy or hesitant, it was still a nice change from the long, boring stories I've read in other games from this genre in the past.<br /> I found Black Widow to be an exceptionally long game. And, this is without playing the Bonus Game at the end. That's an extra added hour of game play, at least.<br />All in all, this was an awesome game, with a great story, lots of fun and well worth every penny of the $2.99 asking price. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy this type of game. If you've been debating on whether or not to get this one...well, ...it played beautifully on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot; so...I'd say....Go for it! :-)
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|How could you go wrong with Dave Grohl?  This is an amazing story about Sound City, a recording studio where many great musical artists and groups recorded some of the BEST albums of all time!  Watch it...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just finished this book for the second time. Wanted to refresh my memory since the movie starts in  a couple of weeks.  I was not disappointed. Held my interest right up to the end
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Been enjoying the series immensely so far, but this season really takes it to new levels. Some of the best episodes and story arcs so far in this season.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Thought it was amazing Henry Cavill was a true embodiment of superman and I enjoyed from beginning to end. Must see movie!!!!
0345803450|5.0|Brilliantly written and tons of fun.  I've read many of McEwan's books and although this isn't quite up to his masterpiece, Atonement, it is well worth reading.
1451668945|5.0|Purchase every single Mary Higgins Clark and pre-order!  Every book of her's is mysterious and finished within days.  Always tempted to call into work because I hate putting them down!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|A good read.  Getting harder and harder go find \\"smart\\" books.  Can't wait go read Locke and Jean 's next saga.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Exciting. Many twists and loved Jake. Many surprises and difficult to put down.  Loved the carry over from Time to Kill!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Awesome.  Could not put book down!  When you think things are bad enough, you are shocked with new developments.  So many interesting twists!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I could not put this book down. I felt like I was living in the story. The narrator will surprise you when you figure out who it is. This book truly depicts the ordinary German citizen during World War II. You realize that they weren't all Nazis and they did what ever it took just to stay alive under Hitler. I would read this book again and again.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is great if you like fairys. Lots of neat stuff in the game, I will probably end up spending money.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I had a hard time putting the book down.  Her  BOOKS always keep you waiting for the next twist or turn.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I read one of the reviews describing the main character as Sheldon from the big bang theory and they were dead on! I was still able to connect to the main character even though his \\"brain was wired differently\\". A very fun read.
B0065CCT6U|5.0|Awesome CD!  Chris Cornell is an amazing singer and songwriter.  I recently saw Chris Cornell in concert at the Beacon Theater in NY and this CD is as good as his live show.  A true talent and gifted musician.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was hoping it would be more like the original. It was nothing like it and really boring. No likey.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Interesting. A good read.  wanted to read the story before seeing the movie. Think you needed to read this before seeing movie
B006M4F67A|5.0|Absolutely love this game.  Fun and keeps your mind sharp searching for the matches.  Great for the kids of any age to play also.
B00BF8OYJO|4.0|very light and funny and kept me entertained.  A good read, well written and holds my interest. Will look for more titles by this author
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|peps world 2 is great when your bord play or get this app you want be bord at all you should by this app
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Amazon really has a great price on these cables. I will never be taking another trip to Best Buy to purchase their over-priced cables.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Good story.  Found the movie was enjoyable and considering the plot it was worth the time .  Well done charters

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love it every one should play. needs to get energy needs to load faster or not take so much to play.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I liked this book and am saddened by the fact that Michael died while writing it. It felt a little like a modern day Robinson Crusoe.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|It works, has nice features but on my kindle Fire HD the alarm is too soft to wake me..great volume IF you are awake.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Would have given 5 stars if there were applications other than just Youtube and Netflix. Should allow third party applications
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook store is a Great tool for business from social media. Easy to download pictures and to be able to boost your item so other people are able to experience your store.
0316074314|2.0|Be assured that my poor opinion is not because the writing in this book isn't brilliant,( because it is) and  that characters don't demonstrate prodigious human intricacies of personality and attitude ( because they do) and that the history is not well drawn because it is astounding.<br />I read two hundred pages, writhing with jealousy and pleasure that someone  so young could know so much and put it to such good use. But then suddenly it became unbearable. Not pretentious or dull, but oh so endless: slow, and though visual, the pace of the book didn't seem to relate to the drama of the events.The charactors were at a distance to the plot with machinations which carried messages from the author that in the end I found tedious.<br />I felt I was drowning in style and background, cleverness and wit but drowning all the same. I kept looking for a life raft but found none.<br />I apologise for not finishing this clearly amazing piece of literature. It doesn't feel respectful but I felt I was having an affair with a book that is a very literate tortoise and unless you have more time than I have, I would look carefully at your diary and your patience.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy it but do not like having to purchase lives and wont.once I have no lives I go yo another game<br /><br />I lil e just as well. Like Gem Journey, Bejewled,Jewels Star 2 and etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's So Simple...That's The Best Part.It's Easy To Use...It  Doesn't Offer Much. Just The Basics..But It's Great..For Homework When Youu Don't Wanna Do All That Work.(; So I Recommend Youu Get It. Youu Won't Be Disappointed.
0803731094|5.0|This is Dad's favorite, if not my little one's. She's always been a bit scared of this story for some reason - maybe I do the voice of the Gruffalo too well? :)  It's very well written for reading aloud (which I can't say of many books nowadays...) and it provides topics for conversation as well as &#34;I spy&#34; stuff in the pictures.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is an amazing game. You can upgrade and fight robots it is awesome. You really need to get this app!!!!!
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|John did it again!<br />When you start to read you cant stop. As allways when John is wrighting there is bumps and turns in the story to make the reader to whant the good ones to get the good outcome, but you never know if it will be that way or not.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book truly changes your perception on how to view life, I recommend this book to anybody because it's worth the read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Challenging and fun! Some rooms are definitely harder than others but that's the fun of it. Makes you think outside the box!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|There are no good views and there isn't a radar thing so u can aim your gun properly. The person who created this is drunk or something  of that nature. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money. Also it glitches every 2 seconds an  the quality is terrible.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Thomas Hardy's book is one of my favorite novels and I loved Polanski's 1979 &#34;Tess&#34; so approached this adaptation with some skepticism. I have not seen the 1998 British version. I was intrigued before viewing with the information that one of my favorite actors Eddie Redmayne plays Angel Clare. But I am thoroughly entranced with the production so far. The production captures the contrasting beauty and harshness of the natural scene and how modern man was disconnecting from the mutually beneficial relationship with the land. Hardy's romanticism of living a simpler life connected to all Nature shines through in Tess. So far it is very true to Hardy's work without the extremes of the earlier production. Granted nothing can equal the sensuousness of the scene of Tess (Natassja Kinski) eating strawberries from Alec D'Urberville but the lushly sensual style may be over the top, making the sensual outweigh other aspects of the film. For anyone not vintage enough to have memories of Polanski's film linked to Tess, this production is an excellent viewing experience and, so far, portrayal of Hardy's ideas. Reviews always say that Tess is headstrong but I felt this is closer to Hardy's portrayal of a woman awakening to unpleasant and unfair realities of a society separated from nature and natural behavior. She tries to please her family, not rebel and the price is heavy. And this film is enjoyable just as a viewing experience.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Always a fan and finally glad I got it after all these years! I want to sit and watch it every time my little girl puts it in.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|It is Citizen Kane. What is not to love? What has not been said about the acting, directing, etc.? The viewing quality of this edition is excellent. I had not seen the movie for years and was impressed with the crisp direction and pace. If you have never seen it, or only seen a badly worn DVD or VCR tape, you are in for a treat.
B00992CF6W|1.0|if you really like the xbox version, don't buy this. stick with the xbox, xbox has more things to do and is easier to use.
0743270754|5.0|Fabulous writing and I appreciate the specific period of time written about.  All who are interested in this period of history and what shapes so much 0f politics today will appreciate this book.
B0083XFFWO|5.0|looks great, very accurate and very flashy!!! has an awesome glow feature but one thing is the hands being a little difficult to read but other than that its wonderful.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Very dissapointed, good thing I only rented it. In the entire movie Tony spends about five minutes in the suit fighting bad guys. The rest is lack luster and boring. Seems they were trying to do more comedy but that wasnt real funny.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|I quiet enjoyed this book, kept my interested right to the last page. I would recommend to read this book.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No instructions given, figure it out on your own, if frustrated, I suggest getting the free help guide app. It will help you to get through impossible rooms.  As soon as I finish game, I am deleting this game , it is a waste of space.
B0086213XW|2.0|I wanted Michelle Williams to play a smarter role, such that she came up against temptation and found a creative way through. Instead, she fell into the same old, boring instant gratification that's breaking hearts and ruining marriages all over America. As soon as I could see she was actually going to cheat with that tool, I turned the movie off. Why reinforce crap values in my mind? I'd rather see something fresh, and more uplifting.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|keep in mind, Im only 50% of the way through. the beginning was clunky, he repeats his words alot and just now the storyline is starting to flesh out and develope into a non-linear story. the magic system is fun and even though it was trying to finally get to the meat of the story, the unique world, allomancy, and the intriguing Lord Ruler is enough to pull you through. I've heard it only gets better
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok I now what you're thanking &quot;should I really get this I have a lot of games it's seven bucks and looks really stupid&quot; this game is worth seven bucks and just thank about it you can build any thing
B000XUBFE2|1.0|this order was through my local library and was supposed to be a borrowed book.  For some reason I was charged for the book.  I don't think that is right.  Thank you.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This app is much more better than Real Racing 3, The graphics are realistic, just like GT racing 2 Heres Why.........<br /><br />Real Racing 3 Specs<br /><br />Pros<br />-Realistic Graphics<br />-Real Cars<br />-Free<br /><br />Cons<br />-Repair<br />-Servicing<br /><br />Gt Racing 2 Specs<br /><br />Pros<br />- Realistic Graphics<br />-Realistic Cars<br />- AWESOME Tracks<br /><br />Cons<br />-Theres One Real World Track in this game, Leguna Seca. :( ( I was hoping for Real World Tracks)<br />-Unknown<br /><br />Play The Game and Find out!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the few books that actually surprised me in the end!  I plan to look at Landay's other novels.
B001I999C2|5.0|Who cares if you know how the cliched storyline is going to run its course? It's Drumline! Lines you know by heart, a young Nick Cannon, intensity, talent, and the good guys win. What more could you want in a go-to movie?
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is amazing! It's free so you don't have to waste your money.<br />It is so awesome, the robots are boxing so well. I haven't had experienced any problems.
B00CGNYDIE|2.0|Puzzles too easy. Confusing options labeled \\"large\\" to \\"small\\" would be better listed as \\"hard\\" to \\"easy.\\" For similar but better puzzles try the picture puzzles online at All Star Puzzles.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|good movie the critics are so wrong with this film cast,acting, and cgi were awesome totally worth the time and this will be one of my favorite films of 2013 GOOD JOB to snyder!
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I enjoyed it.  It was darker in tone and less comic-like in character.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  It also sets the stage for future films, and I hope they make them.
B00E5C3AJM|3.0|These apps are okay but i think that the clothing and accessory s are way to pricey and expensive. But other than that i think that the game is good so im giving it a 3 star rating. Thank you for who ever made this . :D
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read! This book reveals a man's love and bravery for his country, America; in the worst of circumstances. His death as a civilian is truly saddening….no words can describe the loss of this man.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I love this game!!! I play it so much. It is very entertaining .I recommend this app to all<br />gamers and non gamers alike
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its a fun and a good game I mean this game is like has such good grafics I want to play it
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This well written and good humored treatise tackles the difficult concept of what came before the \\"beginning\\" in logical and possible to comprehend terms. Dawkins ability to explain the unexplainable using analogy and science in a heady elixir that debunks the mystifying and provides a wide path to logical, albeit astounding alternatives to the origins of all we know or can imagine, is nothing short of masterful. This should be required reading for all seminarians and theologians and anyone who still labors under the misconception that God created man and not the other way around.
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|I am a big fan of Shakespeare's original text of this play, and also a fan of Joss Whedon's other productions, so I sat down to this rendition of _Much Ado_ with great excitement. I was bitterly disappointed. Nathan Fillion delivered a sparkling performance as Dogberry; Sean Maher was a convincingly malevolent Don John; and the black-and-white spectrum was an interesting touch. Other than that, I was not impressed. The chemistry between major characters was negligible; the original story's gorgeous emotional nuances, all but lost. Many of the cast members seemed to be delivering lines with the mentality of &#34;Let these wonderful lines speak for themselves,&#34; rather than &#34;Let my well-rounded character speak these lines as a natural manifestation of his/her thoughts and motivations.&#34;<br /><br />I was not surprised to learn that Whedon had filmed this adaptation in twelve days. It's a cute project, given that timeline, but a bet that ultimately didn't pay off for me. If you want a version of _Much Ado_ that has laughs, gasps, tears, and all-around fantastic acting, I recommend heading straight for the recording of David Tennant and Catherine Tate's 2009 stage version.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is truly the &#34;Dream Cast&#34; for Les Mis!  I've listened to several versions, but this live recording of the 10th anniversary is by far the best!
B001AJ09JW|3.0|This film does have a certain amount of &#34;fright&#34; that keeps a viewer glued to the screen. It's an oldie, but goodie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved this movie, but nothing beats the 10th anniversary concert!  I think it's great that they used live singing, though!  That really added to the authenticity!
B007REV4YI|5.0|The best of all the Bond movies. Great action, especially the opener. Interesting plot, not predictable. The ending, though, was rather sad.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Although a bit predictable in knowing the final outcome of the story, the same could be said for &#34;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#34; and &#34;Star Wars&#34;.  OF COURSE the good guys are going to win!  That simple fact does not diminish the shear fun to be had through every chapter.  As an avowed geek of the last century myself, I was fascinated and joyfully jumping up and down every time I recognized a reference to some element of my own childhood that made such strong impressions on me growing up.  Most of the films, the video games, the authors, and especially Dungeons and Dragons (First Edition, of course) mentioned throughout the novel and playing such a large part of the storyline itself are all going to touch memories of varying quality and degree to anybody who found entertainment, enjoyment and pure escape from that tumultuous time decades ago.  And as a teacher of high school students now I see so well the continuing development of computer gaming and interactive technology getting us closer and closer to the OASIS program on a global scale.  As a cautionary tale, I can only hope that the human species drive for luxury and excess does not plunge the world into the bleak reality of Cline's &#34; real world&#34;, where the OASIS becomes more important than taking care of what we really have already.  Glorious fun overall.  I will be re-reading this book...
B008C20TDG|5.0|It WILL change the way you view food, and change YOUR life...believe it!<br />It changed mine forever!<br />You created a monster...lol
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I enjoy this book it took me 2 days to read it but it was all worth it it's interesting with her loving maxon and loving ashen and can't choose and then the king to add on too it their needs to be more books like this
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This is a fabulous mystery.  The storyline keeps you guessing to the very end with all the twists and turns.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Fun movie; hits that mark. Competent acting, beautiful special effects but I'd bet in a year one would have trouble remembering it.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Great great movie. Lots of action and Downey Jr.'s witty delivery sells it. Especially his relationship with the young kid. Not been seen on film before really. It's far from simpering and the kid is just your average kid not this little adult in a kid's body we've become so used to in films. Great action scenes and the 3D is used to its fullest advantage. I really enjoyed the movie a great deal. Highly recommended.
B00915G6NK|5.0|We have all the years of this show and we miss them during the year only way to catch up buy and watch them on NCIS LA weekend at our house.  We will continue buying the NCIS LA series as long as it goes.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The show is still very strong and interesting. The characters of Bates and Anna have a real love story and I hope will be expanded. All the actors and the time frame are so good.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love the books but this version takes forever to load on my Kindle.  Causes Kindle to frequently lock up.  I don't have this problem with other books that are smaller so I'm assuming it's simply too large.<br /><br />The Game of Thrones series is easily one of my all time favorites.  The last two books are not as gripping as the first three but are still enjoyable.<br /><br />Update:  Since first posting this review in November 2013 the slow loading problem disappeared.  There must have been an update to either the book or the Kindle.  Nice work Amazon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Although since the last update it wont let me send lives on my phone and ive had the same 6 ppl in there for a few weeks!
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|It's challenging yet fun.  I started playing it thinking it would be a good way to pass some time but found that I couldn't put it down.  There are many levels, and it would have been well worth the money, but I got it as a free app of the day and couldn't be happier.
0316776963|4.0|Funny. As. Hell.<br /><br />This man's narrative voice is so genuine and unapologetic, I fell in love with him immediately. As a person who has always been tied up within herself, I adore how free and self-aware and candid David' Sedaris is in this humorous &#34;memoir.&#34;<br /><br />Sedaris is truly funny. I most enjoy his sequencing of stories--the way he starts from really far away and then brings us back around to the point, making sense of the story. As I read him, in my mind I could hear him saying, &#34;you'll see the point of this, I promise.&#34; While I was confused at times, and I believe he meant me to be, I giggled while I was. This man is funny. At the same time, &#34;Me Talk Pretty One Day&#34; stages Sedaris's vulnerability, the soft spots around which his comedy was first built. I could empathize with him and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This book is not only funny, but insightful and a bit delicate, in the subtle observations it makes about family, love, and the nature of the individual. It's more than worth the couple hours it will take you to read it.<br /><br />Take a look, if you want to laugh and learn a little something about life!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Excellent series.  It is so  nice to find a series that is interesting yet lacks all the overused four-letter words, unnecessary graphic violence and explicit sex that substitute for good story line and acting in so many films.  I would not feel I need to turn this off if my grandkids walked into the room.  Tom Selleck does a very believable job as Jesse Stone and is still very easy on the eyes.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Great Movie to any action packed collection.  Going to make a perfect gift for our action movie buff in the family.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This was nothing like what I expected.  The story was very fresh, a little quirky, which I like but grounded well within the bounds of what could be believable.  Some parts may be improbable, even very improbable, but you could see the forces and technology as an extension of what we have now.  I very much liked the characters.  They were richly developed and knowable.  Good job.
B00EUUJ2M8|3.0|Bought in 3d. I didn't think the 3d was very good and didn't add much to the movie. I liked the movie though.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|I loved it.  Yes it is campy and stereotyped but masterfully so.  It lampoons so many of the treckie/si fi tropes and they are right on target, but the movie is not cruel as it would be easy to become.  It would also be a great movie for anyone.  None of the content would raise eyebrows in most homes.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I liked the Facebook version of this game, but this app is so much better. I really love the in game trading and you don't have to worry about your energy. I will be on this game a lot!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love picture search games and this one is very cool.  The story plot and missions keep you going.  No need to spend money here which I know means a lot to many out there!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is simply amazing.  I can't get enough of his books.  Sycamore Row, while based in a legal setting like his other books, is again different from his previous novels.  I think it is one of his best and have already recommended it to friends. Couldn't put it down.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is really addicting. It brings the awesome movie to life where you control the growth of life. Building and upgrading your forces can be a challenge though.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Should be required reading for all middle-high school age students. Brings history to life! No disappointment on any page. Thank you Ken Follett
B00915NW3M|5.0|One of the best albums ever made.  I have a vinyl copy from about 1970 -- it is among my most prized possessions.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good jack reached yarn. A bit predictable, a bit far fetched, but always fun.  Could have been more hand to hand combat. Good sniper sequence.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|a Beautiful book that made me sad to reach the end. A page turner and a heart warmer. Thank you.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Great movie!  We will definitely purchase this movie when it comes out on DVD!<br />Fun for kids and parents too!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I thought the movie was actually funny - not haha funny, but funny in a way that an alcoholic and drug user is at the position and no drug testing is done during the fictional characters career.  i wonder if that happens in real life.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|Book was slow but well written. Never really was able to get into it. Sarah's Key was a much better choice.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|It's a classic movie of boys meets girl and the cool boy denies his feelings to his male friends to stay cool and pretend to be a ladies-man.
0440133688|2.0|I just couldn't get into it.  I felt the book was too wordy and I just didn't identify or relate to the characters.  Maybe if I were in the medical field I would be interested, but I'm not.
1439190275|5.0|Book is very complete and informative.  Case studies are motivating.  Have given this as a gift to a few friends.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Too predictable and not really BDSM...More like romance novel with some kink in it,  Intense kink but not the real BDSM lifestyle.
0670024856|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. Alma Whittaker is a character that I will think back upon, and ponder, years from now. Ms. Gilbert's depiction of 19th century botany, including mosses and orchids, is fascinating. How anyone can rate this work with fewer than five, even four stars, is a mystery to me.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|There are a few bugs that are still being worked out, and I have had this device ever since it was first available in August.<br />There was recently an update that changed how it calculated the run. I will have to try this since this is the only thing that has been bugging me. I understand that it's difficult to calculate a run since everyone's stride is different though.<br /><br />All the features of this device has been working great. There are a few things that I would like to come out soon or in a new iteration.<br />I would love to use this with a computer. Just pairing this with a computer with software would give me more options than using a phone or tablet.<br /><br />With the phone or tablet you don't need to have a device that is Bluetooth 4.0, which is awesome because this device is more compatible with any device than a lot of health monitors.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to automatically track sleep and detect when I get up and start moving around instead of me having to touch the activity tracker.<br /><br />This doesn't vibrate or give any indication that you have met your goal on the actual device. This would be helpful for me. It does however give your phone a notification when it syncs with the Healthmate App.<br /><br />Healthmate App is awesome. Wish there were more features, but what it does, it does well.<br /><br />There are a few thing that can be changed with some software, but this is still the best activity tracker for my needs.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|This is a well made movie.  I do wish they had followed the storyline from the book, &#34;The Fall of Krypton.&#34;  It was more believable.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it's so awesome and I love love love my little pony ! and I love move P.S I'm a kid
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|whatever you do don't buy the last 2 guns they sucked! I recommend the pulse rifle.And also get the general costume
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Redownloaded after the old time bug had made it unplayable. Just as much fun as I remember. Glad I gave it another go!
0767821629|5.0|Excellent movie, Thanks,
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing this movie.  I personally believe that there is some truth behind this. I recommend seeing the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game. Very addicting. I am so glad I got it. It is really good for all ages.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this game is one of the best I have ever played but it gets really hard and a lot of the better upgrades start to cost glu credits and you either have to find them which is really hard or buy them with real money.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Great book can't wait for the next one in the series<br />Jeffery Archer is an awesome story teller!<br />Highly recommend!
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I always wanted to get her albums however I did see her perform on television and she is fantastic. This Christmas album is very entertaining. Yule Tide Treat and a great gift.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Draws your attention but then it is the same throughout the book<br />Characters never really develop just do the same things over & over again<br />Without reason very shallow characters
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play and is one of the best ones like angry birds candy crush etc. Get it for the<br />price its a steal
B007IXWKUK|2.0|More of the same from first book<br />Need to get into more character development not so much smut<br />People enjoy a good story with great characters
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This novel is based on sound historical research and deals with insight into gathering important scientific information. the characters are finely drawn.  The setting is vividly described.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I've read all of Malcolm Gladwell's book and this is another thought-provoking, mind altering experiences that once read, will make you the smartest person in the room--if you want to be.<br /><br />What I like best about reading Gladwell's is that he has original thoughts.  In a world where critical thinking as been replaced by a whole lot of boring opinions(I'm talking about television mostly), it's nice to hear someone who's examined an idea, and then researched it to give us the 'other side' of the story.<br /><br />Take school size for example.  Getting more money to schools in order to lower class size has been an idea that is constantly pushed at us, when if you look at the research, there's a happy medium size, which means that smaller is not necessarily better.  Who would have thought?<br /><br />Or take the idea that having dyslexia is the worst thing that can happen to your child, yet a disproportionate percentage of our presidents have not only been dyslexic, but obviously excelled.  Can the overcoming of a flaw make us stronger?  This is the idea of the Hero's Journey, where the hero can only complete his task if he overcomes his flaw.<br /><br />Another interesting idea is that once those in authority stop being fair(I'm simplifying) they risk having no authority, only rebellion.  Sounds like we're getting dangerously close to this idea as the divide between the rich and poor continues to grow.  This, to me is the greatest value of Gladwell's work.<br /><br />You can take his ideas and apply them to other problems we're grappling with in our society.  You can take the false idea of smaller class size is always better to the local PTA, and argue for using the same money to pay great teachers more because they truly make a difference.<br /><br />While this book wasn't as intriguing as Blink or Outliers, I still loved it, and will continue to buy anything Gladwell writes.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|This book should have been half the length. It was almost a grind  to get through. I wouldn't recommend it at all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple, functional, portable, high reliability.... Excellent product... After buying one i got another one for my other tv set.highly recommendable
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Gripping and well written. Sanderson unlike many fantasy writers simply gets to the point with out wasting pages and pages on senseless details and unneeded history. Easy to read and a good follow up to mistborn. If you liked the first one you'll like this one too just not as much ;)
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The 2 POV are terribly distracting and confusing. How can u end a book where none of the bad guys get their comeuppance???
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|A wonderful cast, and an absurd day in the life of these people trying to bury their father - complicated by his gay lover showing up, a drug-induced freak out, the various bizarre relatives and one poor sod trying to pick up the girl engaged to the bloke under the influence. Then it get weird!
B00006I53S|1.0|Very disappointed with this lens from Canon, it has been released from 1998 and until now there is no improvement , the creep of the lens is not only annoying but also dangerous for its safety, not very comfortable for a walking lens, focus is slow, colors come out washed out and at 135 you  need a tripod for a sturdy  image. The good range is between 32-110mm, It looks great on Rebel T2i but that is not enough. I returned but i wanted to give it a second chance....i looked for a used one but all were with dust inside and dented lenses, Ι had the chance to compare it with the 18-200mm and i can say there is a big difference between those two lenses. I preferred to keep the 18-200 and I will recommend you keep your money for a better lens.
B0026S1XD2|5.0|One of my favorite musical pieces when it first came out, it's still one of my favorites today. Cool Stuff!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A truly beautiful story about our most ugly truth. The narrator's perspective is brilliant. I strongly recommend this book to everyone.
B00DVZ414C|5.0|When I was in high school and college, I wanted to be a folk singer hero. How could I not like this music? &#34;The Last Thing on My Mind&#34; remains one of my favorite folk songs ever.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|A lot of the themes in the book are repeated themes from the previous two and they're not explored enough (or rather, at all) to merit the repetition. There's practically no character development and when the author attempts it, it falls miserably flat.<br />I vastly enjoyed Divergent, I liked Insurgent a little less but it was still a decent book. This on the other hand felt like a complete waste of time. I couldn't wait to finish it just so I could move on to reading Horde, the last of the Enclave series, a far superior trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I agree with a previous review.  This is addictive!  I just wish I could chat with Friends who are playing.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I was a Captain America fan back in the 1940's.  I did see the disappointing CAPTAIN AMERICA 12 chapter seriel, and therefore welcomed this full fledged origin film.  I heartily recommend it to everyone, comic book fan or not.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like this game but I hate the fact that you have to buy more crowns to continue play level 10 or so. And even when I did buy the crowns, they never gave me them to use in the game.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is NOT a movie about &#34;generous whites&#34; helping &#34;helpless Blacks.&#34;  It's a movie about people helping each other.  The main character writes a book describing the treatment given to black people, especially in the south, but to a large extent everywhere in the U.S., and the maids giving her their stories is a help to her.  The title of course refers to the term given to servants.  This is a thoughtful and inspiring movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! Plan to read again .. I would recommend this book for sure for the right audience of course.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This one has some very talented actors who take you into their way of life, lending some on-going drama week after week.  I've never been drawn into a period piece as I have this one.  I look forward to each season.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Just watched this classic after years.  (In fact I realized that I had never seen the entire movie).  Absolutely wonderful and touching movie for the family.  Plays with the idea that Santa is real and is perfect for kids in the 5 - 7 age group who may be beginning to doubt Santa.  The colorized version is nicely done and you also  get the original  B& W version if you prefer to be authentic.  Can't go wrong.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love the game and i totally think you should get the app and if you like the game temple run you would like this game to and hope this helped
0375851569|5.0|Good set of introductory Seuss books, using them as an introduction to books for my 18 month old daughter.  Some reviews complained about the size but they're large enough for the excellent artwork to be quite clear.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|Not up to par with mayer's previous music, but still good. This one is more country & jazz than others, but still good.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It still has some bugs, other then that it's ok. I like the Facebook version better. Except for needing energy that is.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This was a great movie!  It definitely keeps you thinking!!  I love the twisting plot too!!  Great date night movie!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really fun! It's also a good game to play when you're bored. It has a fun creative and survival mode. I think it is worth my 7 dollars. The only thing is us that i can't figure out how to do multiplayer
1571200851|5.0|Great art quilt book. I haven't made any of the patterns, but I simply enjoy reading and looking at the pieces
B00E0SX118|4.0|Very funny.  Great for kids and adults alike.  Kind of like the Flintstones for a new generation. Husband and 3 grandsons enjoyed it
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Alterbridge  keeps getting better and better!! You can definitely tell that Mark tremonti's Heavier influences that he showcased on his solo &#34;TREMONTI&#34; album are fluent here as well.
145210655X|5.0|Still funny after months of reading this with my kids.  My boys are little, 6 and 4, and were only slightly familiar with the Star Wars universe when we bought this book.  Now they're quoting lines and loving the saga just as much as I do.  Jeffrey Brown has created a perfect mesh of Star Wars and the joys of being a Dad.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is the final book in the Divergent series. We finally get to see what is beyond the city, how the factions were created and what that means for the future of Tris and Four. Allegiant might be the end of the trilogy but for their world it may just be the beginning.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|It reminded me of my days in Marine Boot Camp. Very realistic. I recommend the video, particularly if you ever served in the Marine Corps.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|It had a good, though predictable plot. I liked it mostly because I like the Star Trek series in general.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is the Most frustrating game I have ever played,  but unfortunately it is additive and so much fun!  Glad I was finally able to download it to my Kindle.
B00A757EFW|2.0|These types of games are not for tablets or phones.  A joystick is much better as an input for this kind of game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. I have used it for several months with no complaints. I have used several white noise devices in the past to go to sleep. This is my favorite a nd my kids use the old devices. I love that you can combine different sounds. I also like the binaural beats. I often use this during yoga to set a relaxing mood with the chants and flutes. I am very pleased and strongly recommend to others!!
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|Love the Carpenters.  I have tried to collect their albums since Karen has been gone as I believe she had a voice that few others could ever match.  And Richard is great with the music that accompanies her singing.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|It's fun until level 10 cause I've been on ten for over a month and if you know how to beat it write a review and I'll be on the lookout ;-)
B003B02O0A|5.0|I had seen the movie when it came out, but since the author has written another book to follow this one I wanted t refresh my memory. The book was so much better. Now I can't wait to read the next book.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Love this album so much! It sounds great and has such amazing and crisp clean production, that is if you listen to it on quality speakers. Don't just play it through cheap apple headphones silly people! Gaga shows so many sides of her artistry and experiments with numerous different genres.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This definitely works! In fact it works better than what you get from Google Play. I highly recommend this product. I was surprised at how much junk the cleaner found
B005PK58TI|4.0|Not a horror fan, but this is a unique twist worth watching.  The secrets of the house unfold over time to keep you engaged; Jessica Lange steals the show.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|great show! really enjoyed it. it starts off a little slow, but once it gets going its great. anyone who enjoys Sifi will love it
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I have been a Superman fan since Christopher Reeve was the star.  I hope they continue the series with this actor.
B0084TWN9K|1.0|These dark stories about disagreeable people and dead end situations were a chore to read..  Ths book is one I would not inflict on friends or family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! I can't put it down. The levels get harder gradually. Appropriate for all ages but younger children may find the later levels too difficult.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Wish there'd been a Jack Reacher out there somewhere when I was in my twenties!  It's not often you find someone with physical attributes like Jack Reacher that also are smart, self-sufficient and has a dry sense of humour.  This was my second Jack Reacher novel and I was delighted to discover I!m not going to run out of reading material for awhile!  There are many more Jack Reacher novels out there waiting for me.......and for anyone reading this review that needs a new action hero in their Kindles!  I guarantee you won't be disappointed!  Start with &#34;Killing Floor&#34; and just keep going!  See you along the way!
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|this game is so tight I got every thing in 3 days and you should make another one and if you do I'm going to play it
B003IHWLL8|2.0|All-star cast, but there's not much you can do when the storyline is ridiculous. It could have been something, but it turned into a hippie statement instead.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is so tight but I only got 2 robots I'm tryin to get zues and Midas but I got to get some gold coins
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Downloaded this app for me and my grandson. This is the best app for us to play together. Love the themes and characters, so cute. Thanks for a great app.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Compelling and troubling story facing too many communities. I couldn't put this story down until I finished reading it.  Memorable
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|just love this movie<br />I take care of my husband and this movie is one of the one I put on<br />to help me just relax.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Absolutely worth a read!  It's a hilarious book with fantastic dialog, characters that are relatable, enjoyable and tell compelling stories.  It's a great read and gets 5 stars without question.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|it's way better than snap chat because when ever you take a pic it is all Blurry and fizzy and I look really ugly so this camranis so much better than the one on snap chat
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant:<br />Now this was a great book. A great book. Overall. But I honestly have to say, I HATED the ending. Hated it.  Veronica Roth wrote an amazing trilogy that deserves to end with an amazingly satisfying ending to both the readers and the characters. But this book has neither. For those of you who haven't read it, and aren't going to, you really should. No matter how hard processing the ending will be. For those of you who are going to read it because you loved Divergent and Insurgent,  go ahead. Read it. This book is perfect closure to the series answering all of the unanswered questions and filling in the missing spaces.  But I'm warning you now, the ending will surprise you. Like a lot. And finally, for those who have read it and are in a sate of complete shock, rocking yourselves back and forth in the dark corner of the room, crying your eyes out... Your'e not alone. Now the reason I gave this book four starts wasn't only because of the ending. Just mainly because of the ending. Veronica Roth seemed to just be slapping things on throughout the book. New characters, new places, new ideas, new relationships, new losses. I know that's how most trilogy-enders are, but this was somewhat annoying to me. I think allegiant went a little off the path of the series. Most of the time while I was reading this book, if I stopped to think about the last sentence, paragraph, even chapter, I  didn't  know any of the things that happened or were talked about in the last books. Whoof that was a hard sentence to write, but it's true. At least i never got confused from all the slapping together of things. That's good i guess. Well that's it. There aren't many negatives I can give to such a great book. So, beside that, Allegiant was well-written, full of suspense and action exactly like you'd expect from Veronica Roth. But I am seriously considering finding her and making her let me write an alternative ending for this book. I'm seriously considering it.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Biggeing  is slow but I like it. I like true story anyway!!<br />Good actor and good story I got get into it quickly!!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Fantastic read for a coming-of-age, newbie-freshman POV and encouraging to find your own voice, write your own story and keep on with wherever life takes you.<br /><br />It took me a bit to figure out a few of the neat details, like the play on names and then to get into the whole fanfiction inside of a fiction novel, but once I could wrap my head around it, I enjoyed it. The world that Rainbow created was engaging and amusing. I took a break out of writing my NaNo novel to read this one, which was mentioned in one of the monthly peptalks as being written during NaNo. It doubly inspired me.<br /><br />Cath was an amazing character, so was Levi and I loved her snarky roommate Reagan, I couldn't wait for drama to blow over with her sister, Wren and I could relate to the whole Professor Piper, and then the writing partner &#34;Nick&#34;. If you are a fangirl, there are dozens of little fangirl moments in here for you.<br /><br />If you just want a fun, light-hearted read, then go for this as well, but know that there might be a good emotional punch at the end. I loved it.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Great product for a great price. The blu rays are great quality at an amazing price. Descent case with everything I could ask for at a great price.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This case cover for my Kindle Fire fits perfectly and looks so classy.  Keeps my Kindle Fire safe from scratches. Great cover!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it is finally available on my kindle fire! Can't wait to finish all of the colorful and tasty levels. Thank you Amazon.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Good movie, good plot and ,entertaining.  I truly don't understand however why, in the last few years and movies Jeff Bridges talks like he has a mouth full of ????.  He sounds awful and you can't understand a word he says.  I used to like his work but no more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love it! Definately recommend it. The graphics are great with realistic sounds sights and movements. One of the best hunting games I've seen for the kindle.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|We love the Iron Man series, that's a given. So we enjoyed this movie as usual. I would watch anything Robert Downey Jr. is in.  Never the less it's a great movie.
B00G4CXHSK|2.0|I got this game at version 1.4.0.2 so if it is higher I don't know if this review will be of any value - I got the game thinking it looked cool. So I downloaded it and started to play it. It was really fun. It looks nice and is hard enough but not too hard to make you frustrated. I liked the controls. They weren't complicated at all. Also, it isn't hard to raise in-game money. The game made me feel like I was playing a game for the Nintendo Game Boy or Game Boy Color. I thoroughly enjoyed it until it crashed on the first boss fight. I restarted the game hoping it would only be a one time thing. It wasn't. It crashed about two more times until I deleted it. Noodlecake: I will continue to look at this game until you fix the crashes. I love Noodlecake and love their games and this one looks promising.
B00DW36G32|5.0|My husband loved it of course, lots of terror.  For me it was gruesome. You choose!  Not for the faint of heart.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|A lag when casting chrome browser. Feels like the product is kind of a beta version. I guess for $35 it delivers as priced
B00A287PG2|5.0|This is the best description of the main business aspects of consultancy.  It is good because it is an outsider view based on a profound review.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Cool. No way to hate it. The energy restoration time seems to be a little frustrating, but that's what made it addictive
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|i was hoping that it would be the 3d version as well like in store but over all great movie and fast shipping. the family loved the movie
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was actually my first John Grisham book, and I loved it! Full of twists and turns in the plot!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy Candy Crush Saga has come to Kindle. I was so jealous of my friends and co-workers who were playing on their phones. I kept waiting for it to come to Kindle so I can get hooked. Thank you. This is a great game!!!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Excellent story construct and execution that meanders into a hazy philosophical ending.  Lightly exposed cultural touchstones ground the timeline well.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|I finished this book about a week ago, and find myself still thinking about how much I enjoyed it and wish it could have gone on longer.<br /><br />I think the strongest aspect of this novel is the foreign culture and language Leckie created, and which rooted the narrative in an interesting context. The most obvious creative license she took is to play with the language of gender - only the pronoun &#34;she&#34; is used, regardless of actual gender. It takes a bit of time to get used to, but I found it added interest to the story, and didn't prove to be a distraction for long. It's unusual, but serves to advance the story rather than to seem to try to make any kind of statement in this reality.<br /><br />The way Leckie imagined a very powerful Artificial Intelligence to mold a future society was also very well done. In this story, unlike most, the near-omniscient AI isn't so menacing as it is just a fact of life that allows this society to function and pursue its agenda of projecting its idea of peace among many system. The protagonist is a part of that AI that has been splintered off from the whole, and years later is struggling with &#34;her&#34; identity. Also of note is that none of the characters is so supernaturally intelligent or otherwise flawless in actions that you feel as though you're reading about a super being. This is a common quality in sci-fi that makes me immediately lose sympathy for such characters (ex: Ender in &#34;Ender's Game&#34;), but is gladly absent in &#34;Ancillary Justice.&#34; These qualities - language, culture, and technology - are all rationally employed, and create a vision of the distant future that makes the story easy to buy into.<br /><br />I've read this book is supposed to be the first of several, and I greatly look forward to reading the rest.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|A good look into a man of position with a terrible problem.  Denzel plays the part well. the first 30 minutes will put you on the edge of your seat.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|I bought this book after hearing about the Damascus incident on public broadcast radio. It opened my eyes on nuclear weapons and I found the personal accounts riveting. As an Air Force retiree, I remember being in SAC command and watching the B 52's alert on the runway. I had no idea we were so close to possible disaster. I enjoyed reading this book and learning the history of nuclear weapons.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this series.  I couldn't put these books down until the very last page.  I've reread them since purchasing because I thought they were that good.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|So good, so entertaining and so compelling; this is a wonderful book...<br /><br />The Blade Itself, where do I even begin???  For one, the character development is absolutely excellent and so skillfully done.  The payoff is a cast of characters so tangible and so real you inevitably fall love with them and want to know more and more about who they are and where they came from.  Trust me when I say this a wonderful and special fantasy novel.<br /><br />The author's style is incredibly skillful and entertaining.  He's hilarious when he needs to be funny, gut-wrenching when he seeks to draw on the reader's emotions and breathlessly exciting when it's time for action.  This book has some of the coolest characters and action sequences I can ever remember reading in any book.  I think has to be some of the best fantasy writing your money can buy, and I recommend you do just that.<br /><br />Enjoy!.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it's listed as free but gives you time limits for play and wants to charge you to continue. I would rather just buy the game up front than have hidden charges.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book has everything.  Lots of interesting characters, a good plot, mystery and suspense.  If you are looking for sex, you won't find it here.  Just, a very well written novel with some science fiction thrown in.  Or is it?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like the challenge of trying to advance to the different levels. You need to figure out how to do it. Some of the levels are easier some are really frustrating. Overall a great game.
B000B7VZJM|1.0|Had to return it. It was not as advertised. MovieMars was really great about processing the return, but the DVD was advertised as new, and it was scratched and had fingerprints all over it and was clearly just re-shrink-wrapped. It was also formatted for the wrong region, so even if it had been in new condition, it still wouldn't have played in my dvd player. You get what you pay for, I guess.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|it does what it's supposed to do. It can charge up both my Galaxy 3 and Ipad or an Iphone in the car, and does that pretty quickly. The price was reasonable, and all in all I'm happy. I had to label one of the sides though as the printing to designate the receptacles as apple or android (and it's different amperages, etc.) is very, very small.
B00FAIW0ZA|1.0|&#34;I know what we should do&#34;,as the band sits around half asleep talking to their greedy agent.Lets release what should be a double album but release them seperately and charge top dollar and then re- release the whole thing as a double album with extra tracks.<br />At the end of the day these guys will have to perform in front of these dedicated fans and look them in the eye and expect some form of applause..pretty ordinary form ..
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|Really poor handling, to the point of aggravating. I actually called the game dumb. So you end up watching the game load up more than you play. I quickly lost interest.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I watch TED talks almost every day on a variety of devices (laptop, Netflix on ps3, iPhone, and Kindle Fire). They are inspiring and entertaining and I absolutely love them. So, as far as the content goes (topics, variety, quality of speakers, etc.) and the quality of the app (availability on a variety of devices, selection of videos, basic functioning like loading and playing videos and video quality), I have NO complaints. I would really love it, though, if I could log into my TED online account on my mobile devices so that I wouldn't have info in several different places that don't communicate with each other. It would also be nice if it would show watched, bookmarked, downloaded, and favorited icons in list view on all devices (Netflix excluded, of course) to make browsing easier.
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|This is on a list of &#34;serious&#34; books I am working on as a project, and was in the last third of books I planned to read - I wasn't sure about this but was pleasantly surprised how much I ended up liking this classic from Ian McEwan. You really don't like the narrator, Briony, as she is somewhat unsympathetic, but the real tale is about her sister Cecilia and a childhood friend, Robbie. The core of the story is wrapped around wrongdoing, guilt and atonement.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Before a trip to Scotland, my friend insisted I read this series of books.  She told me the plot of the time traveling Clair Randall, so I couldn't wait to get to the action.  These books don't disappoint!  I couldn't put it (them) down.  At over 1000 pages, it is not a quick read, but I didn't want it to end.  This is the third in the series, so start with the first one.
B00FAVRFXE|4.0|I begrudgingly started watching Matt smith's portrayal of Dr.who for this exact reason. I cant wait! And I pray that it lives up to all the hype!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Sorry it is not as good as &#34;A time To Kill&#34;, but still is very good reading, more like the old John Grisham.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|It's an unusual story that stays with you. The characters are memorable. I skipped over bits though. Just wanted to get to the end.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I am a &#34;Reacher Fan&#34;, I've read all the books, with the exception of Lee Child's novellas. At first I was not looking forward to seeing Tom Cruise play my 250 pound, 6 ft 5&#34; hero, but he actually did a pretty good job, The movie is worth the watch. Cruise had reacher&#34;s personality down pat.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This is a great product!  It provides a good grip, and fantastic contact with my iPad.  Even better than the Bamboo stylus.  I have used it daily since my bamboo fell apart.  I've used it daily for more than 7 months now.  Great buy, worth every penny.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Continues to challenge visual recognition. It&lsquo;s great exercise for the brain. The pictures are very colorful and that makes each of the puzzles that much more challenging. The storyline is interesting, too. Would enjoy more of these.
0618154248|5.0|Great book set.  My son loves these books, and these fit the bill at a well balanced consumer cost.  :)
006202406X|1.0|I what a terrible conclusion.  From the moment I started it seemed off - shifting perspective, cluttered storyline and the ending.  I wish I hadn't read it.  And now have no desire to see the movie.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The movie was fantastic, and the case had a neat pseudo-3D effect by switching between the jaeger and the kaiju depending on viewing angle. The digital download is through Flixster which I had never used before, but adding it was suprisingly straightforward, even if I'd rather just watch a straight-up video file off the internet for lazy viewing. Picture quality was outstanding on the blu-ray.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very readable and filled with moral dilemmas.  Loved the Epilogue.  The author kept switching points of view and experiences of the different interrelated characters.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Truly scary and twisted. Neither of the successive seasons have lived up to the first. I really enjoyed watching it -- again!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I don't used twitter very ofter but I've never had an issue with this app. When I do use it.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|If there ever was a page turner for a business book, this would be one of them.  I always wanted to know what happened next.  Of course, you also have to have a business sense in order to understand what this book was all about.  Over all I loved this book and recommended it to my IT Team.
B00F30S0Y0|1.0|Arcade have a weird habit I noticed with their last record. Their first and third albums were excellent (Funeral and the Suburbs). But the second and fourth albums (Neon Bible and Reflektoar) are beyond awful.<br /><br />I expect album 5 to be good even though 4 was awful because for whatever reason their odd albums click and their even ones don't.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|The action scenes were okay. Over the top really. Movie was more about alien invasion than Superman. Superman is about saving the people, not destroying them. Christopher Reeve was better.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|You get too draw something and let the other person guess what you drew and you'll start with colors .But you can get a lot of coins and then you can get all kinds of different colors and then you get to ask if you want a different person to guess while the other person is still guessing BYE.<br />Y
B000001FN3|5.0|I love this group.  This is an album I haven't listened to before and I'm enjoying it a great deal. Especially loved a couple of the songs.  Looking forward to making these a part of my must listen favorites.
B00008CMR6|1.0|Just plain terrible.  John Wayne was in his sixties by the time this monstrosity was hatched and he was plainly not up to it.  You feel sorry for the horse that was required to carry his bloated frame.  Director Howard Hawks was also in his dotage and had completely lost any sense of pacing or story.  The plot is a preposterous mishmash of Civil War and Texas western, and Wayne is cast as a Texan who somehow served as a Union officer and afterward turns his hometown frontier community upside down looking for pro-Confederate informers.  In real life, of course, Wayne's character would have been lynched on the spot in postwar Texas.  Supporting cast member Jorge Rivero is laughably bad; his fractured English couldn't even be saved in the dubbing studio.  He later turned up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in the anticlassic \\"Werewolf\\".  Nor is Jennifer O'Neill any better.  Anyone who wants to see how sensational Wayne and Hawks once were together should catch \\"Red River\\".
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|This is one of my favorite groups.  Been listening to them for years.  I purely love their music and I believe this is one of the best albums EVER!  I Loved practically every song.  Thanks a bunch for a great listen!
B00354YA2M|5.0|Like his many other books this is a very good read. You may not agree with some of his statements, if you are Australian, but they are extremely entertainingly presented.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Love Alan Parsons.  This is as good as all the others I've enjoyed through the years.  Thanks for a great listening experience.
1594487154|4.0|Dan Pink is one of our more provocative writers in human motivation and growth. His contention here, that we are all selling most of the time, is not new, but is presented with a wonderful &#34;curation&#34; (as he would say) of examples, facts, and figures which make for compelling arguments and fascination reading. I found his points so useful that I invited him to speak at one of my thought leadership conferences, where I found he writes the way he speaks and vice versa: with clarity, humor, and a great sensitivity for people and their calling.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Challenging enough to keep you interested. Sometimes I had to stop and come back later with fresh eyes. I really enjoyed it.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is a quick and fun card game.  Simple rules, easy to learn, and it does not take long to play a full game.  Great as a beginner or filler card game.  Looks beautiful, too.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's fun. Just wish I didn't run out of lives so quickly. I hate having to wait 12 minutes before I can play again.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|A real experience once you figure out how to use this thing. A laugh a minute great product for family photos
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|This this one of the top Hitchcock shows made, love the suspense but the ending could have been better, what a classic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Mind tantalizing!  Had so much fun with my love trying to figure it out! Omg! Omg!<br />Can you escape tgis!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Loved this movie.  Great plot and of course the actors were great.  The ending kind of left you hanging or left it up to you to guess what happened, did he make back OK?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Loved this keyboard when i was on android. definitely the best around now that they integrated a swype like keyboard as well.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Could not wait for this one to come out, have watched this now twice since I got the compete season.  Can not believe Ziva (Cote de Pablo) quit the show, big void to fill.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was so unfortunate to wait this long to read an ending like this. This author blew up our balloon so she could pop it at the end. Furthermore, she made Four a weak and unattractive character which was uncool.  Bad move. I will not be seeing the movie now...what's the point?
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I like it. There's enough references to the Avengers and the Marvel universe to keep the name, but don't expect the Avengers. Think more along the lines of X-files or early episodes of Fringe. A good watch.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Fun game but I would like to see hints  before every game and stop charging so much throughout the game. I would rather buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would really love this book but it is by far one of the best books I have ever read!! I could not put it down!! I can't wait to read the next one!! It is very well written and keeps you intrigued every second! This is a must read!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Its great game im playing it everywhere and i cant stop! I think that is the best fighting game ever!
B009WUBERW|4.0|Very good action movie with good one liner, excelent to relax as you do not have to think to much to follow the plot. it was my second time and i do not say no for a third time sometime.
0553801473|3.0|The pace was slower than pervious books. It starts to pick up towards the end.<br />I was looking for a continuation of previous books
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great movie.  Storyline was good. Tom was great as Loki.  We watched this for the first time before going to see Thor: The Dark World.  And I must say the story continue fabulously.  Will definitely watch it again.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These movies are classics.  The price is amazing, especially when you consider that you get all 6 films plus the interview panel.  Great value.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I got this game for my daughter and son and I see them playing on it all day.it's not a bad game cause I tried it out but the only problem is the time limit and I don't like that so that is my review
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is a great movie.  The acting is fantastic. This movie actually got me hooked on Star Trek.  Also, the price is the best.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game I have played. The way it is set up is great, easy to to navigate. I love it.
B001O54NHQ|3.0|I LIKE PRINCE BUT, THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS CD WAS THE SONG INSATIABLE. THAT SONG IS AWESOME !! IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON A SINGLE.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Southside.  DisCuss did did.  Find.  Duncan.  DudDidvdjdbjdbxjxbxjdbdjd  Thai is the best game ever j don't play anything except this game
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson is always so engaging. This is my third book I've read by him, He brings history and interesting connections to life. Now I'm going on to number four.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaing it keeps you looking for more. Can't wait for more rooms to be available.  If you like to solve puzzles this is for you
B0087ZG7J8|2.0|to like it, but there were so many problems with this movie. i probably don't need to list them since others have. but you know what makes this movie REALLY unrealistic? not the dinosaurs, but the fact that a KID with no weapons survived smong the dinosaurs longer than ADULTS WITH GUNS! BOOOO!
B0050DZN4K|1.0|This app used to be fantastic, but the developers are not updating it to work with the current version of Feedly.  Find something else.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Intricate, crystal clear story of hurt.  I worked with girls in the foster system.  This author got it right.  Yes, and flowers can speak and even heal us, crazy humans that we are.
B00FR0PVSY|5.0|In brief, Lemmy just doesn't know how to put out a less than stellar album. There are some classics in the making here.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|It is a fun little side-scroller. It doesn't try to tell the most compelling story or have the most original gameplay. It just pays homage to the older 2-D side-scrolling games of past generations. The controls are simple, and for the price (FREE), it can't be beat.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Wonderful action packed movie that pays homage to the original.  The cast is brilliant.  We watched it three times during our rental period, and we are not usually movie watchers.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|The best visual 3D effect (Passive 3D system) to date. Every thing in the movie looks so real with perfect depth of field. This is a good movie to try out your new 3D TV. Acting, however, ....
B004SIP71M|5.0|Meryl Streep .... what else can we say. She deserve every inch of the OSCARS that she received. She was nominated again in this movie but the Academy gave it to someone else that year. I think this is one of her finest performances next to Sophie's Choice.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|watch out I had all of my suits or armors and when I played it after the mission my armors were gone!!!!!!!!!!??
B00006I53S|5.0|excelent
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Good flick and of course Captain America is quite handsome!  I wanted to see this because I'd finally seen the Avengers and thought it be nice to see the first one.
B002RI9ORI|5.0|there are not enough stars to rate this excellent book. I gift it at every opportunity. It goes a long way to expose the myths and  misconceptions that people have in medical treatments and the supplementary health industry. It should be obligatory reading for everyone! Easy to read too!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I wish that they will up date it soon . I wish it was as up to date as the  Xbox version at least
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|Interesting game for my toddler, he loves it. He is very good at it as well<br />He likes trucks and cars.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I haven't read a page turner like this in a long time. Read this book NOW!! It keeps you asking yourself what you would do.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Nice book. BUT, I can't say it was not my favorite. I think the author wrote TOO much detail which was unnecessary. It dragged on. The book could have been much shorter if not for the abundance of writing. I don't usually skim through pages, in this case I had to.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This is my first bad review I've written for an app, but this app is so bad, I had to. After downloading it, I tried to use it. It wouldn't load, &amp; tried two separate times. It froze my Kindle Fire HD twice, &amp; I had to reboot it both times. My Kindle ran so slow until I deleted it. I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|This is book everyone should read, particularly if they deal with children.  Dodge is able to dispel old myths about how the brain operates and changes.  His style is very readable and entertaining. My book club loved it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Ok so here's the deal this is a really fun game I have not had many problems on the game so far I have all the main ponies yes, all of them... aside from spending a few years on this thing it has not shutdown, it is way stupid for having to pay for rainbow dash and rarity with jems, and having some or rather most of the ponies expensive is ridiculous. That my friend is pretty crazy. My only concern is that you have in app purchases when their are little kids that are not always careful and with just a slip of there fingers and a few taps and they have bought themselves jems and or bots for an insane amount of money....... It is very stupid. It also takes too long. Update faster please so... board... with ... the... same... old... non updated version .....gah!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|&#34;Stream online video, music to your TV using your smartphone, tablet, or laptop.&#34;  The statement makes it appear as if you can stream anything from your smartphone, tablet or laptop which isn't true.  You can only stream &#34;certain&#34; things from your particular device.  From your smartphone, you can ONLY stream Youtube or Netflix.  From your laptop, you can only stream what is your chrome browser.  Apple TV is the way to go since it offers true mirroring.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|This cd is noisy and over produced ,filled with ego over art.Where is the art?<br />There is so little feeling in these vocals,that I assume that pomp and circumstance wins out.<br />Even a turn with r. Kelly seems more like a plan than a collaboration.<br />Maybe my ears are just too old to admire the effects and antics that cry for applause.this is not a portrait of pop art. I like the Jeff Koon's cover.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I think this book was too hyped up and just didn't hook me in like the other 2. It was nice to see the story from the otherside of the factions but, It just didn't feel realistic and it almost seemed as though the fighting was forced just to keep the story moving. I wish it would have been more exciting, edge-of-your-seat like the first two. Falls flat.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was yet again another wonderfully written book that you did not want to put down.  It was a nice change of pace to have no murders or horrendous crimes as the center of attention.  As always there are lots of surprise twists to keep you guessing until the very end.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Makes playing the 3DS XL a LOT more comfortable. The grooves on the back really help with longer play sessions.<br />I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a better grip instead of looking into 3rd party iterations.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the old Grisham, the one we fell in love with.  Seeing the familiar characters again was like a visit home.  Story was compelling and as usual couldn't put it down, but didn't want it to end.
B00AZQGZVM|5.0|The product was just as described and top quality! Recommended for every Animal Crossing fan looking for a plush of KK.
B00BB8UJKG|5.0|This isn't exactly a coming of age film since many of the stars were already established.  This is, however, one of my favorite films on many levels.  Watching Natalie Portman as a thirteen year-old is pure delight.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.
B00E5Q1HJS|2.0|It's OK but mostly forgettable. Lacks the heart and wisdom of a true Star Trek film. JJ Abrams dialed this one in. Shame on him.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Now they need to make the game for the original Kindle Fire!  Too many developers are ignoring the original version of the Fire.  Amazon should compensate us with cheap buybacks, so that those of us who supported the Fire from the get go and through word of mouth can at least be able to use all the Fire apps!
B003MS2QD6|2.0|This is a con job. The movie has not been extended in any way! They added some goofy 10 minute &#34;making of&#34; piece after the credits. i won't fall for this con job again! Avoid &#34;extended&#34;.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Quality product with solid manufacture. Prompt delivery and good packaging. I would not hesitate using the company or supplier again. Love this thing. Keeps a great edge with just a couple of swipes
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Robert Downey is amazing!!! Love the film but the bad guy was really pathetic. Just what we need; another soft talking brit who is supposed to be menacing - NOT!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|game is good...some levels are too hard. need more free help or hints. it has taken months for me to get through some of the levels
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|If someone gave the people who invented Power Rangers a ton of money and told them to make a movie; this would be it. What a mighty morphin' mess!! Pacific Rim should go straight to the garbage can.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|great game just started playing can not put it down.I really injoy the easy quest I have not started pvp yet still under protection but I believe it will be awsome
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Great Movie but stupid story. I don't care what you think of F. Scott - BORING!!! Leo this wont win you the Oscar.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Very good I also apply the basic principles in Gym, Ladder etc.... very good. I tried it and got stonger core muscle inside 2 weeks.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works fine. On the rare occasion I need a calculator, this one is handy and works well., I'm glad I got it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This installment does nothing to tie in or review the events that happened in previous installments.  Neither does it stand alone without some knowledge of previous events.  The story jumps right into chapter narrations by the characters from books 1 & 2.  I felt like I had dropped into the middile of conversations between characters I barely remembered about events I could hardly recall.  To cap it off, the ending was a real bummer.  For the life of me, I can't remember why I was so excited about reading the final book in the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you like Grisham, you like Grisham, and I like him. His books always captivate me and grab my attention. This one, like almost all of his others, was totally satisfying. As long as he keeps turning out books, I'm reading them.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fun game unfortunately it crashes a lot; but still fun.<br />I like this game because I can play it for relaxation.<br />I don't like the fact that when it crashes I lose items.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was the first Grisham book that, to me, was almost a comedy. No heavy reading here, but likeable, sad-sack characters who fall into a litigation that they have no chance of winning, and one that could ultimately put them out of business. This was just a fun read, and Grisham never disappoints me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie from the first book - read this one before you see the movie - it makes a lot of things make way more sense - can't wait for 11/2213! Opening night of Catching Fire!!<br />Team Katniss, all the way!!
1400069289|4.0|An insightful look into why we behave the way we do, and some concrete suggestions to change for the better.  If the book could actually make us do what we're supposed to, then it would get a five, but it's definitely useful.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|For never being into hunting this game was sure addicting. Fun and challenging the further you get. Now I wish I could do the real thing for a much larger challenge.
1250038820|5.0|If you follow Brandon's internet pages you will love the book. We always see people in the street and we have no idea what struggle they have in their lives, or the amazing stories they know; this book shows some of this stories.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read this book for the first time 11 years ago and I keep on buying it.  With the hard copies, I'd lend them out and have to buy a new one when I wouldn't get them back.  Finally, I've got a kindle and that problem goes away.  This is a fantastic book.  Not intended for people under age 14.  The story is extremely graphic.
B008Z9L94O|4.0|Re-master balance is off. I have a receiver that comes equipped with an oscilloscope, and it shows exactly what i'm hearing. Full dynamics on the left channel, and lacking some mid-range and bass on the right.  My stylus is mounted as perfect as it can be; (tracking force, azimuth, VTA/pitch, zenith, and anti-skate). I'm sure a lot of tricks were pulled to get this VERY high dynamic recording on vinyl with enough spacing between the grooves to prevent the stylus jumping out every time the bass kicks in. I didn't get any un-recorded distortion like others have stated in their vinyl purchases.(I.E: &#34;Zero&#34;).  I highly recommend using a good quality stylus when playing any current/newly released-on vinyl recordings (After 1990's) , as the dynamics and fidelity can be too great for average quality styli. I used the Audio Technica 440 Mla stylus for my playback, and had no tracking distortion. (especially the very close to the label inner grooves). Since I could correct the balance issue, and had no skips, or distortion, I gave this item: 4 stars. Great sound, and beautiful packaging.  Just wondering if a fifth disc would provide enough room for full dynamic range on both stereo channels without cramming the songs so close to the inner grooves?  IDK.... I hope this review helps other SP fans, as well as other vinyl listeners.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|After watching the first twenty minutes of this 2013 version of &#34;The Great Gatsby,&#34; I thought I would eventually give it a rating of one star.  The early material seemed too busy, acoustically grating and loaded with phony overacting.  At the point at which Gatsby is first introduced to the viewers, I started to change my mind.  I came to believe that the early material was deliberately designed to grate on viewer nerves, so when Gatsby appears and the ambiance becomes more serene, the audience will relax and see Gatsby as the suddenly appearing focus of ultimate handsomeness and coherent speech.  As the movie unfolded, I began guessing that those who put it together must have intensely studied the 1949, 1974 and 2000 versions of the same story and guided the 2013 result toward an evolved version that omitted the shortfalls that critics and reviewers assigned to the past three versions, then added strengths coming from advances in movie making often wasted on violence for the sake of violence.  I think the 2013 movie is incredibly beautiful visually and enriched by an acoustically gorgeous sound track.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|In no way do I want to take away from what the author went through but I just found this book to be an incredibly boring read.  I had to force myself to finish it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I'm over 13 years old and we can have fun with video games too. This will be the best game on your best game chart.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|works as expected. Great product. Love the two options for charging. Having the 2a option is great for my Iphone.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|Interesting narrative about the start-up & how things work at Amazon, it gets too technical at times but good overall.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I read the War of Art, Do the Work and Turning Pro all back-to-back. All were suggestions for a training program I'm taking. All three books were a great delight, easy to read, amusing and each delivering several great messages. When ever I'm hung up on my project I think ah the resistance is after me. It encourages me to dig in even harder knowing that I'm not alone. I strongly suggest all three and look forward to what else Steven will teach us next.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I could not stop reading this book it Was fantastic and very interesting throughout the entire thing. I would recommend it to anyone who wants an interesting adventure.
B000ASATYO|4.0|The story is the undoing of this film.  The components are inconsistent, veering wildly from fantasy to comedy to horror, never truly doing justice to any of the ideas it tries desperately to showcase in the time allowed.  If they had stuck with one premise instead of this scattershot approach then this might have been a great film.  Instead, you have a ghost-buster Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox), trying to bilk unsuspecting homeowners into thinking their homes are suddenly haunted (the joke being he provides the ghosts).  It's at that point that another plot is shoehorned into the story, that of a vengeful (dead) serial killer anxious to have the highest body count ever achieved.  Instead of gaining the credit though, the blame is placed on Frank.  Then the movie becomes \\"the wronged-man on the loose\\" with Frank trying to clear his name.  To complicate matters further, an insane FBI agent (an overwrought Jeffrey Combs) shows up with an instant vendetta against Bannister.  Unfortunately, this proved to be one villain too many and it challenged the focus of the story about a faux grim reaper.  It's at this point that a judicious rewrite should have taken place.  They had one element too many and should have excised it from the story.  Instead, they foisted this version on the public and it was a not a financial success (which they blamed on the film Independence Day, the Summer Olympics, and a lack of marketing).  The critics were torn; Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs down.  Word of mouth could have saved it if it had been a film worth bragging about.  Obviously, that didn't happen.<br />Years later, I'm still torn.  I love/hate this movie.  At times it's brilliant, the humor is mostly great, the special affects a wow.  Trini Alvarado was perfect (as the only rational character in the film).  Michael J. Fox was fun.  Dee Wallace was appropriately creepy.  Loved the faux grim reaper.  But.  Just bits and pieces of this film work, the rest is just annoyingly extraneous.  It always leaves me wanting more/better from the likes of Peter Jackson.aneous.  It always leaves me wanting more/better from the likes of Peter Jackson.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love this.show, I own the first one and now the second, just need the third one and ill have my full collection untill the fourth one comes out on dvd, definitly worth the price and watching.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it is a very good game! love just sitting in the comfort of my chair doing some hunting. and it is good for kids to practice.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My husband read Wool about a year ago and now it was my turn. Great story and a page turner, for sure! Can't wait to read another Howey book.
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|Enjoyed the historical and graphic detail of the early settlers, gold rush days and West Coast. The book is only as long as it is because of the convoluted way it has been written in relation to the &#34;Star Charts&#34; which is its unique style. Enjoyed excellent prosee and use of the english language, however the ending when it finally came, demonstrated to me how simplistic the story line really is and was obvious very early on in the piece. Made useful reading on long lane journey.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|Keeps me informed and is easy to use:) Very nice to have and a great reminder, especially when your running low on time and need to figure how much web time you got.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it allows me to play only a few games and then asks for $0.99 to keep me playing or I' ll  have to wait 20 minutes
B00EJB44VW|5.0|this is an excellent investigation and analysis - well worth the read and well worth the time to do that
B00005RHGK|5.0|I love this movie. I grew up watching this as a teen and it shaped how I viewed films afterwards. The best part about this movie is that it still holds up and is probably better than 90% of the mainstream horror flicks coming out these days.
B00EO10M54|4.0|thoroughly enjoyable experience. enjoyed miley's new songs with the revamped image she brought along with it. great to listen to overall.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I can never decide which Nolan film I like more, this or Memento. Both films leave a lasting impression of the viewer, but this one is so much more visceral. The subtleties really sell it for me, in Jackman's last half hour we really see him shine. Bale is solid throughout as always.
