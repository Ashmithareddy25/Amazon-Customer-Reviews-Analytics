B0009A1AS2|2.0|This was something of a letdown for me, being a longtime DT fan (who spent many hours in high school playing guitar along to \\"Images and Words,\\" \\"Awake,\\" and \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" trying to keep up with John Petrucci); not for any lapse in technique on the part of any of the musicians, or for a lapse in songwriting ability; it's just that none of the songs appearing on this album seem especially original.  It's as if DT took parts from other bands' work and pasted them together to make songs.  This happens all the time with lesser bands, but up until now I had held Dream Theater to be in a class above other bands.  Four songs here disappointed me greatly. <br /> <br />\\"I Walk Beside You\\" seems more U2 material than Dream Theater material.  By itself, it would've been ok, but then there's \\"Never Enough,\\" a song whose structure, chords, progressions, and even tone sound almost directly lifted from a song called \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" by Muse.  The title track begins in the same vein, parallelling \\"Shine On, You Crazy Diamond, Pt. 1\\" by Pink Floyd.  The guitar playing is different, but the opening progressions are basically identical.  After this, it branches out and becomes much more interesting and original, a standard I've come to expect.  But before this, there's \\"Sacrificed Sons,\\" a (somewhat late?) 9-11 tribute song whose lyrics seem over-emoted to the point of almost parodying the tragedy (\\"Channel surfing...fran...tic..ally...\\")  I'm sure this wasn't their intention, but even they would have to admit that placing an extended, uncharacteristically upbeat keyboard/guitar jam session in the context of a heartfelt tribute to all the people who died then is a little superfluous, if not insensitive.  It's akin to hearing disco music performed at a funeral.  Again, there are stellar moments of technique here, as always, but their originality and the sincerity just don't seem to be there.  I hope their next album will be better.
B000089RVX|4.0|I never really like to listen to \\"mainstream artists\\", I barely lsten to the radio, if at all. I am more of a Prog-Metal(Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, King Crimson, Iced Earth)and Extreme Metal(Lamb Of God, Shadows Fall) guy, but when I heard Fallen, I was amazed.  <br /> <br />The first thing that I noticed about Evanescence is Amy Lee's almost operatic and emotive vocals. IMO, she could make any of those \\"American Idols\\" cry. Her vocals are more along the lines of Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil or James LaBrie of Dream Theater than Linkin Park.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are: <br />Going Under - I dig the opening guitar riff <br />Haunted - Has the \\"Metal Edge\\" to it from the double bass drumming and guitar riffs <br />My Immortal - Very beautiful song. The first time my girlfriend heard it, she had a tear in her eye.  <br />Imaginary - Amy's vocals are top-notch on this track <br />Whisper - The outro to this song has a very chilling and gothic feel to it. Also some awesome guitar riffs here.  <br /> <br />A great sounding album. My only problem with it is that some of the songs(Bring me to life, For one) have hints of the Linkin Park style synth in them, which kind of turned me off.  <br /> <br />But from what I hear, Amy Lee said that the forthcoming album would have a different sound to it. Hopefully she means that there will be less synth and more rock.
B00005LQ04|1.0|I am more than a little confused at the rave reviews for this movie.  Back in the 70s, this movie had a rep in my high school of being really scary (until \\"Halloween\\" came along).  I finally saw it on DVD the other week and found it to be one laughably horrible, horror film.  Even after you strip away the 70s kitsch, there is little that is scary or original in this movie.  The thinness and banality of the plot is only matched by the lame dialog and wooden acting.  You kind of guess its about a covern of witches when the background music hisses \\"Witch!\\" every now and then--so much for suprise or suspense.  The only scene that took me by surprise was the one where the blind man was killed--never thought the attack would come from that direction.  What is the point of a covern of witches opening a dance school anyway?  Is there some weird connection between ballet and witchcraft? Perhaps there is a special spell for keeping thin.  And why run a school if you are constantly having to murder students who stumble onto your occult activities? [Besides, being a witch isn't against the law, is it?] Seems like the strange deaths of students & school employees would cause even the German authorities to get curious. You might think those zany witches would pick a cover that draws just a smidgen less attention to themselves.  The most amazing thing to me is that this film has been made into a 3-Disc limited edition.  I can't imagine how you'd fill 3 DVDs with material from this piece of shlock.
0143034901|5.0|I loved this book.  Suffice it to say, if you love to read a \\"good\\" book, run to your book store and pick this one up!
B0001LYH9S|4.0|I have to admit, when I first got this CD I didn't like it at all.  But it grows on you and now it is one of my favorite Bowie CDs.  It is almost up there with Scary Monsters and Station to Station in my humble opinion (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  <br />I particluarly like Small Pot of Land, Hallo Spaceboy, and Strangers When We Meet. So stop complaining about how dark and 'noisy' it is, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!  <br />PS. Get the deluxe double disc edition. It has TONS of remixes on the bonus disc.  <br />\\"Bye bye spaceboy....\\"
B00005JOGE|5.0|I am watching the concerts on MTV and online right now. LOVE IT! I hope they release a complete DVD with all of the concerts instead of just small portion of each.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Without a doubt my favorite Bowie cd (sorry Station to Station and Low you are the runner-ups!). In fact, while we are endulging in superlatives, this is probably one of my favorite CDs of all time.  Not a single bad track.  It's strong from beginning to end.  It opens with the briliant It's No Game Pt. 1, with voice distortions, some girl blurbing in Japanese, and angry, aggressive guitar work. It just gets better and better from there.  I particularly like Teenage Wildlife, Because You're Young, Ashes to Ashes, and It's No Game Pt. 1.  I can't wait for the extented/delux/collector's edition of this one!  Get it! Now! Best 15 bucks you'll ever spend.
0380820846|5.0|I loved this book.. I had read other romance novels but this was the very best by far. Colin was so handsome and dashing, the type that hero of book should be.. And I could totally relate to Penelope. This got me hooked to the other book in the series but this is by far the best.. I loved loved it.. Her writing made you feel good. And even in the begining I liked how that even though Colin didn't know he loved her yet he still was protective of her feelings... I know wether I like the book or not if I like the herione and If I'm attracted to the main guy.. this book was exactly the kind of romance that I love, sweet not instant love, I love stories about girls who have been in love with one man all there lives and the guy is just obliviouse and then one day he knows. To me thats true romance, when it's not trashy and stuff when it's sweet and it makes you feel warm inside. Anyway 5 Stars.. Great Book totally recomended.
B00001OH7P|2.0|Now, I know I'm probably gonna get beat up for saying this, BUT i dont particularly care for this CD. I'm a huge Bowie fan and I have most of this CDs. Maybe it's dated, or maybe I just dont understand early Bowie all that well, but I was very dissapointed in this album. After all the hype, I expected a listening extravaganza, but it didn't quite happen. <br /> <br />I like Scary Monsters, Low, Outside, and Station to Station much better. These are stand-out stellar cds. Get those instead.  <br /> <br />Ok, now you guys can rag on me all you want.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I've seen many Hitchcock movies, and I think this is the best.  It has good acting and really good suspense.  If you haven't seen it before there will be times when you have your fist up to your mouth and your eyes agape.  There's a good villain, a beautiful girlfriend, a humerous nurse, and a likable and confident hero.  Top-notch and edge-of-your-seat!  You gotta like this movie!
6300273199|5.0|The best AC/DC movie.The interviews are pretty cool but the concert is way better.It's got Shot Down In Flames,Let There Be Rock,Live Wire,Highway to Hell, and other great songs.I like Brian Johnson but he cant sing anything like Bon Scott.If you've never heard AC/DC pick this up or if u love AC/DC and dont own this(i feel bad for you) PICK THIS UP!
B00097DX3U|4.0|With their sophomore release, \\"Out of Exile,\\" Audioslave defy their critics again by proving that not only can they rock, but they can rock consistently. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, \\"Out of Exile\\" only breaks new ground on a select few songs.  The album is essentially one heavy-rock song after another, driven by guitarist Tom Morello (who gets at least one melodramatic guitar solo per song).  Cornell's troubled drawl sounds as much like an angrier Eddie Vedder as it has before, but here, his voice is perhaps strained by age. <br /> <br />The album begins with \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" which starts off with a strong chord progression that eventually becomes drowned in the other sounds of the song.  Such is the same fate for nearly every song; there are usually one or two interesting guitar tricks that are drowned out by too much clutter, to the point where songs become painful exercises in trying to discern different sounds from one another. <br /> <br />Even moments of sonic simplicity don't hit the spot the way you would hope them to.  Cornell's voice reaches moments of emotional purity, which are promptly drowned out by the rest of the band.  The most painful moment on the album would have to be \\"The Worm,\\" with a cheesy 70's-era guitar solo near the end that forced me to question the integrity of the entire album. <br /> <br />Things pick up again with \\"Man or Animal,\\" which tries out a few new types of sounds.  The funky \\"Dandelion\\" is also a highlight, with an interesting pace and melody.  The softest song on the album, the lyrics are bliss: \\"Settle down now and sit with me / Let me tell you how this all came to be / A yellow flower with your pedals to the air / And flying on paper wings that brought you here.\\"   <br /> <br />Audioslave fans will also like the title track, which builds from a ch-ch-ch-ch guitar crunch and unleashes into Cornell's best performance and the best melody on the album. <br /> <br />There are very few moments of true bliss on the album, but overall the album will grow on you if you give it a chance.  There's nothing as adventurous on \\"Out of Exile\\" as the softer content of Nine Inch Nails' \\"With Teeth,\\" but on the other hand, the melodies and instrumentals are overall stronger than Nine Inch Nails' latest effort.  Get both albums. <br /> <br />I'd really give this album a 3 and a half stars, so I rounded up the score to a four.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Scary movie is a fun movie worth a buy or rent. It's a great movie to watch with your friends at a party. It's a spoof off horror movies, mainly I know what you did last summer and Scream. But it also mocks the Blair Witch Project and the Matrix briefly. If you watched Scream and I know what you did last summer, you'll probably enjoy the jokes better. But, the first time I saw it, I hadn't seen either but still found it hilarious. There's not really much more to say besides it's an absolutely hilarious movie that will deliver plenty of nonstop laughter. This movie throughout delivers a constant amount of laughter and afterwards, you'll be telling your friends about the great jokes.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|System of a Down's signature mash-up of heavy metal and strong political overtones continues with their latest effort, \\"Mesmerize.\\"  Whether or not this is a good thing depends on whether or not you enjoyed this band's previous efforts. <br /> <br />The sound of \\"Mesmerize\\" is very, very heavy, complimented by furiously delivered lyrics.  The songs are seeped in politics; \\"Sad Statue\\" is about a nation disillusioned by today's government, and \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is a brash anti-war song. <br /> <br />If you're expecting to be enlightened on aforementioned political and American topics, don't expect to have any epiphanies with \\"Mesmerize.\\"  The vocals are so rough and delivered so harshly, the message is lost.  Green Day did this much better with last year's excellent \\"American Idiot,\\" where you actually could enjoy the anti-Bush ballads you were listening to. <br /> <br />Other aspects of \\"Mesmerize's\\" sound are just as uneven.  The instrumentals blend into each other and are hard to differentiate, even between different songs.  The vocals are oft-annoying and abrasive, especially considering scrappy guitar-player Daron Malakian now takes up as much time on the vocal track as lead singer Serj Tankian does.  In moments of clarity the two singers harmonize and provide a cathartic release, but these moments are few and far between.  <br /> <br />The overall tone of this album feels very amatuer, like a group of college buddies got together and decided to rant about important world issues.  They don't miss out on opportunities to use profanities and vulgar language, though sometimes that's kind of the point (such as on \\"Violent Pornagraphy\\").  But why was this verse necessary, in the song \\"Cigaro?\\" \\"My **** is much bigger than yours / My **** can walk right through the door / With a feeling so pure / It's got you screaming back for more!\\" <br /> <br />System of a Down don't take many opportunities to be musically creative, and instead stick to an angry metal-head formula throughout most of the songs.  Many of you may enjoy this formula, as album sales may suggest. <br /> <br />The brightest moment on the album is \\"Question!\\", which ditches the angry metal rock act for a few moments of Eastern-influenced instrumental bliss. <br /> <br />If you're already a System of a Down fan, you'll thoroughly enjoy \\"Mesmerize\\" and its upcoming counterpart, \\"Hypnotize,\\" which is due out later this year.
B00000ILDF|2.0|I am a huge fan of Alien and Aliens, they are two of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.  Perhaps they should have stopped there.  While the original was a little slow to get going, it was ground-breaking and incredible effects for 1979.  In 1986, we were presented with the sequel which many considered better than the first - ALIENS.  The reviews were outstanding and in praise of the special effects. What I particulary liked about Aliens was the amount of aliens - everywhere you looked,  they came thick and fast and in lots of different shapes too.  And, I am pretty sure that CGI wasn't used on the sequel either. <br /> <br />Now let's move to the third instalment which came out in 1992.  The real beginning of revolting CGI - Alien 3. I admit I had not seen it until last week when the DVD landed in my lap.  I basically avoided it because of all the bad reviews over the years and admit I must agree with many of those reviews.  The storyline had great promise (Ripley is the soul survivor after her spaceship crashes, and ends up on a planet full of male prisoners). The main problem with the film is that there is only one alien and his appearances are short and sweet (except for the baby alien at the end).  This movie does take ages to get going.  When the action really sets in near the end, we are unfortunately treated to some awful CGI - the alien looks comical running through the tunnel.  I wonder why they didnt  use the aliens from the 1986 film which were so realistic. <br /> <br />While Alien Resurrection (4) has also been criticised, it is a tad better than this poor effort.   Avoid and stick with the first two.
B00005JNJT|5.0|At last, a movie worth watching, worth discussing & worth writing about.<br /><br />Batman Begins (Batman 5) is bigger, better & bolder than all its predecessors. The beauty of this one is that the focus is on Batman & not what the Riddler is doing or what prank the Joker is playing or what surprise the Penguin has in store.<br /><br />This movie is Batman all the way. The carefully selected Christian Bale is a wonderful choice for the Lead role the best Batman since Michael Keaton, he does justice to the role. He might seem a bit too young for the role of Bruce Wayne however we need to keep in mind that this is Batman \\"Begins\\" hence him being young.<br /><br />The entire movie was good actually it was great except for a few minor things. The Batmobile was a bit rugged as opposed to refined, the three main fight scenes (The one in jail, the one at the School & the last one) were really quick & you can't quite make heads or tales of it. Oh yeah, at the end of the movie the weather was probably cold but Christopher Nolan did not have to use Katie Holmes' assets to get the message across - on IMAX it is very evident - for those who have no clue what I am talking about, watch the movie & you decide.<br /><br />As for the cast; excellent choice, everyone of them. Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his \\"mentor\\" roles - he might just get typecast if he keeps accepting such roles - Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen. Gary Oldman created a whole new him; a cross between Tom Skeritt & Edward James Almos plus a little extra. Katie Holmes, what can we say, she's all grown up now & can act too, good for her. She's got her life sorted out, she makes good movies & is dating Tom Cruise. Life is good. I do wish her the best though, she deserves it.<br /><br />Verdict: thoroughly enjoyable. A great movie for fans or moviegoers alike. Bale is great as Batman & is very convincing. Great movie, well made, well filmed & I am sure it'll be well liked as well.<br /><br />Rating: 4 & ½ stars.well liked as well.    Rating: 4 &  stars.
B000001FN3|5.0|I have the original release, and love it. I bought it on cassette, and loved it. I bought the CD and loved it. This is one of my all-time favorites, not one weak spot; I've read where people have said they didn't like the \\"aimless, rambling\\" parts of it , particularly \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But remember, it is part one of a story, and it is appropriate for that part. When you get to the \\"Arrival,\\" it picks up considerably, and this is as heavy as anything I've ever heard.<br /><br />Adding narrations by Orson Welles puts this masterpiece through the top, and the addition of some keyboard arrangements, a couple guitar solos,  remixing the sound, and reverbing the drums, are like a football player dancing in the end-zone; it's not necessary, but it doesn't hurt, either.<br /><br />The whole atmosphere of this work reflects the macabre mood of Edgar Allen Poe's stories, but the sound itself is so beautiful,it's something to speak of, being that the stories are , well, gruesome. I have read that Arthur Brown had no business singing on this record, but that's wrong; at least I think. \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" is a story of someone's guilt over doing something terrible to someone else, and being driven insane over it. Why not Arthur Brown? That voice is as wild as any I've ever heard(The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown).<br /><br />Choirs, orchestras, sound effects, it's got it all.<br /><br />And it will familiarize you with Poe's work, if you're not already.
0316666343|5.0|I hestitaed for a long time to read this book because of its <br />subject (the rape and murder of a child). Please don't let this subject prevent you from reading this book. The crime is at the beginning of the book and is not detailed. The little girl(the victim) narrates how her tragedy effected her family. It sounds as if this is a real downer story, but it isn't. The little girl helps her family discover her killer and there is divine justice at the end. Please read it.
B000002U9W|4.0|This work is misunderstood, to say the least. The reviewers who trash this, are expecting a lot more, or something different. The \\"suite\\" that was on side one of the original LP, I thought was really great, and if I put on a headset to listen to it, sometimes I'll drift off to sleep. It's not boring, as some say, just some of the sections go on; I see that as \\"atmospheric.\\" One thing about this creation, the band with the orchestra and choir, have played it live, and pretty faithfully, at that. I particularly like the part subtitled \\"Mother Fore,\\" that gradual building up from droning organ chords with just the little \\"chip!\\" on the hi-hat, adding voice after voice, and when you think it has reached its conclusion, that prominent drum fill comes in, and, \\"aw yeah.\\" It's got such an atmosphere, I get a nice cold chill in my neck when I hear it. The whole piece is excellent, as well.<br />Side two, on the original LP, begins with \\"If,\\" Roger Waters starting to come into his own as one of rock's great songwriters.<br />\\"Summer '68\\" is typical Rick Wright lyrics, drinking, and one-night-stands. This doesn't have to be bad; actually, it's a strong sounding song, no complaints here. Wright can carry a tune, which is more than I can say about Waters' later histrionics(The Wall, The Final Cut, etc.).<br />\\"Fat old Sun\\", on Gilmour's own admission, sounds just like The Kinks. I can picture Davies singing it. And the guitar solo is vintage David Gilmour (that's \\"Gilmour,\\" not \\"Gilmore,\\" by the way. Frequent misspelling of Gilmour's name is a pet peeve of mine.).<br />\\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.\\" There's nothing psychedelic here, unless you notice the repetition of the spoken parts. It's three separate recordings of the same sentences, played at intervals. The music is quiet, relaxing, and pleasant on the first two sections, and fuller and more up-beat in the third section. The thing that makes this unlistenable, to me anyway, is \\"Alan's\\" atrocious table manners; I don't enjoy listening to someone slurp, gulp, and chomp their way through a meal, he sounds like the food is killing him; does he have a hairlip, and can't keep the food in? Some people don't mind it, but I find it grating, and in this case, a Pink Floyd recording that would've sounded a lot better without the \\"sound effects.\\"<br />Over all, though, it's a good record, even though Roger Waters did say \\"it should be buried, and never heard again.\\"someone slurp, gulp, and chomp their way through a meal, he sounds like the food is killing him; does he have a hairlip, and can't keep the food in?

B000006FYP|3.0|BF is a decent movie but some of it is not credible like how can the Riddler construct a death trap hideout with riddler bombs and his own version of Battleship with out alertling anyone and all his costumes, he had like 6 costumes in this movie but i still always enjoy the villains acting better then Batmans, i like the villians more.It bothers me that Batman never layed a hand on Riddler and Two Face, even though they were trying to steal his identity. They got alittle fancy with bATMAN facing his enemies in this movie, in the first two movies ,Batman killed the enemies by kicking their asses, in Batman forever, Batman desrtoys the enemies by throwing a batrang at The Riddler's parachute thing and killed Two Face by throwing coins downward and Two Face fell trying to catch the coins, if i were Batman, i find their wussie asses and beat the life out of them, the villians got off easy in this movie.
B000002KGT|5.0|This  isn't the line-up that the band made it with the first time, but that's OK. I can't get over certain reviewers pinning their distaste with this line-up on Buckingham and Nicks. Didn't Mr. and Mrs. McVie and Mick Fleetwood hire them? This band, no matter who is in it's ranks, has a certain image that's unique to THEM. A bizarre fact, Dave Walker, who was Mac's vocalist for a short time, also had a brief stint with Black Sabbath. Odd, huh?<br />Back to \\"Rumours.\\" I don't know how a bunch of people, who at the time, couldn't stand the sight of each other, could make such a fine piece of music as this. Another reviewer, one I've personally taken pot-shots at in the past, gave this a five-star review, and I had to try to figure where I was mistaken. But no, It's that good. The tight vocal harmonies, the solid rhythm section, the layered keyboard and guitar parts, all blend into a \\"pop\\" record that just about everybody liked, bad reviews notwithstanding.<br />Listen to the lyrics, and you can hear the pain in these people's lives, but it's a good listen, anyway.<br />And, as an addendum, I simply adore Christine McVie. Such a great songwriter; imagine a Fleetwood Mac with her AND Peter Green, at the same time? So different, but so good; that would've been something.
B00000F14B|5.0|The Music Man has gained more noterity after the popular revival on Broadway and Disney's made for TV rendition. But, the orginal is the best version for any Broadway buff to see. The Music Man has Robert Preston who is best known and loved for his role of Professor Howard Hill in the Music Man. (Robert Preston also played the role on Broadway). With show-stopping songs and dance sequences and good humor this movie is perfect for fans of good impressive old-fashioned musicals and old family films.<br /><br />The movie centers around Proffesor Howard Hill a con man who cons towns into payng him money to run a boy's band. Only Howard Hill dosn't know how to carry a tune. When Howard Hill lands in the small- stubborn town of River City, Iwoa. He encounters a few problems with his scheme a libraian Marian who gives piano lessons that his hard to trick or con. But, Professor Howard Hill, manages with his suave naure to trick the town into his plan while falling for Marian.  Well, eventually it comes to the point where Howard Hill must reveal his plan to the rest of the town-so he can stay in the town with Marian. Only will the town forgive him? Or is it going to take a miracle to pull his scheme off?<br /><br />With such cathcy tunes as \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" and \\"Shoop-ee\\" It's easy to see why this film was such a big hit and why it remains a classic musical. THis musical is great to watch with the kids and even us grown-ups will find ourselves singing along. Robert Preston is absolutely brillant in the role of Howard Hill it's hard for me to imagine anyone else playing that role-but him. He REALLY makes the movie. I love the music and some of the dance sequences are just as impressive as those in \\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\" and \\"Newsies.\\"<br /><br />If your a fan of old movies or musicals you must own this DVD in your collection!
6300189821|5.0|80's romantic comedy movies have never gotten a great rap, but this movie displays many of the reasons why we love these guilty pleasures.  Yes, the guy is meek... and yes, the girl is a mannequin, but since when have great romantic movies ever been about what's \\"realistic\\".  An ignorant, near-sighted, movie-goer who can't possibly read between the lines of a quirky plot to see what the real message of the story is will never appreciate a classic like Mannequin.  But for those of us who know how to see beyond the basic setting of the movie to the undeniable chemistry that is going on, we can't help but love it!.  When it comes right down to it, it's a story of two people looking for a place to belong, one needs someone to believe in him and inspire him, the other is a girl who's looking for someone to accept her just the way she is, charisma and all.  The world will always try to come between two people who are striving to make a \\"complicated\\" relationship work, but ultimately love really does triumph over all.  The chemistry between Andrew McCarthy and Kim Catrall made this quirky romatic comedy really come together, and to this day Mannequin has warmed the hearts of all the \\"hopefull-romantics\\" who see it.  All-in-all, Love makes you do things you never thought you'd do... and THAT's reality! ;)
B00024I2Z4|4.0|This movie is probably the last really good animated feature ever made- although not holding up to the classics such as Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King or the Pixar collaberations. But, this movie holds up the classic Disney tradition of good storytelling, animation, and moving music.<br /><br />Probably one of the last classicly animated movies. Mulan takes place in China just after the Huns invaded. With the Huns invasion the emperor of China asks one man for each family to serve in the army. Mulan a troubled girl who is trying to find her place in the world while, dealing with the fact that she dosn't fit in. Mulan continually humilates her family who she loves greatly. She feels as though she is a dissappointment-unable to find a husband. Well, when her father is asked to serve in the army Mulan can't stand the thought that she might lose him. She decides to disguise herself as a man and serve for him. When Mulan is discovered missing her dead family ancestors ask the help of Mushu-a wise cracking dragon to guard her. Mulan quickly finds herself having trouble in the army and in constant conflict with the guys. But, eventually becomes acceptted especially by Chang the head of the army. When, Mulan is injured her secret is revealed. Chang spares her life... but, when Mulan sees the Huns heading in the same direction of the army- it's up to her to warn the guys and save China from diaster. Only problem will anyone believe her now???<br /><br />With such memorable songs as \\"Reflection\\", \\"I'll Make A Man Out Of You\\", and \\"True To Your Heart.\\" You'll find yourself singing along with the songs. I love the song \\"I'll Make A Man Out Of You\\"- Donny Osmond has the most amazing voice. Les Miserables fans will be pleased that Lea Solgna sings the film version of \\"Reflection.\\" I LOVE the bonus features such as the music videos especially the one with Jackie Chan(He was the Chinese voice for Chang) singing in Chinese \\"I'll Make A Man Out Of You.\\" The quality on the DVD is better than the version I saw in theaters.<br /><br />I love this film and continually watch it over and over again. I especially like Chang in this film. I'll give it 4 stars-it's great but, it's not gonna be a classic such as Beauty & the Beast or the Lion KIng- I think the girls will like this film but, the little guys might not be into this as much.

B000002LGQ|5.0|This was Madonna's fourth album was released in 1989. Thanks to MTV Madonna became a household name in the 80's. Her first album, \\"Madonna\\", was your basic dance album. That album was followed by \\"Like A Virgin\\" which continued with the dance theme but she was showing strength as a vocalist. For her third album \\"True Blue\\" she began to show her songwriting skills and began to tackle more serious issues such as teen pregnacy in the hit single \\"Papa Don't Preach\\". In 1989 however she took a far more adult turn on \\"Like A Prayer\\". Her lyrics were now dealing with a troubled marriage \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\", her father \\"Oh Father\\" and the death of her mother \\"Promise To Try\\". The title track was a huge single complete with the obligitory controversial video. \\"Express Yourself\\" was also a single, but the version heard on the album is a bit more pop and less dance. She even duetted with the purple one himself, Prince on \\"Love Song\\". Overall this was her most mature album to date. The entire album is great, but for me the standout tracks are the title track, \\"Promise To Try\\", \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Spanish Eyes\\". After this album Madonna began to explore her sexuality more than before and for me anyway her music became more hit and miss. This album marked the end of the 80's and the end of the first era of Madonna.  <br /> A footnote about this album, contrary to a previous review, this album was NOT part of the Madonna remasters, those only included the first three releases. When this album was originally released, the first pressings had been heavily sprayed with Patchuli oil, Madonna's perfume at the time. After 16 years my original CD still has a very faint smell of Patchuli to it!! Perhaps if and when Warner's re-issues \\"Like A Prayer\\" they include they will include the original \\"scent\\" as well.
0743454537|5.0|This book was one of the best I have ever read.  It runs a quick second to Anita Shreve's \\"Pilot's Wife\\".  This book is about the rocky love of a family, who although they are making a ton of mistakes they are trying to do what is best!  I have never cried reading a book.  I cried pretty good at the ending of this one.  YOu have no idea the turns it is going to take and it makes it awesome!  I had my doubts of enjoying this book, I didn't like Jodi's \\"Second Glance\\", but this book makes up for it in a major way!  You must read this one!

This place is a place to write about the item of what the customer has checked. It's not a place for trash talking don't like Avril's music, fine. But that doesn't mean you can just write whatever you want to write. What the customer(as in the peeps who uses this site) wants to know about the item. So if you're mature enough to understand this, even if you are saying \\"this guy who wrote this review is stupid\\", just do the \\"right\\" thing. <br /> <br />My sis bought this CD and it really is great. Would've been better if there weren't 2 albums at once, and just put the best of avril's music into one album.

006054094X|1.0|Remember *Chariots of the Gods?* Well, this is Book Two in the series. The author's hypothesis is that in the 15th century the Chinese sailed all over the world, transplanting features of their culture everywhere they went. Then they went xenophobic, cut off all contact with the outside world, and destroyed all evidence that they'd ever set foot (or sail, as the case may be) out of Asia. Convenient, isn't it?  <br /> <br />The first \\"proof\\" of this is based in a mind-numbing and ridiculous examination of old maps, navigation, and cartography. If the author really was a sea captain, I sure wouldn't want to be on his ship! It was enough for me to read that \\"con ymana\\" is supposed to be medieval Portuguese for \\"a volcano erupted there.\\" Now I'm not an expert in medieval Portuguese, but I do speak modern Portuguese, and this phrase is translated \\"l entrou em erupo um volco.\\" I know languages change, but that much in 500 years?  <br /> <br />Then there are the supposed parallels between Chinese and New World cultures, which are less than impressive. If you look hard enough, you can draw parallels between any two cultures. For instance, does the fact that the word for \\"earth\\" is \\"eretz\\" in Hebrew mean that the Hebrews colonized England? Or that both the Egyptians and the Incas made mummies mean the Incas hopped the next available spaceship to the Middle East?  <br /> <br />As well, when cultures intersect, there is ample documentation. People are always fascinated by the otherness of different civilizations, and they write, draw, and tell of them in detail. And when ideas are exchanged, the process can be traced via the archaeological, mythological, and sociological evidence. If somebody as different as the Chinese were in the New World only 500 years ago, there would be tons of evidence. A few scanty straws doesn't cut it.  <br /> <br />I can't imagine that even the author believes what he's written. I keep expecting him to pop up on Oprah or David Letterman confessing to the world that the whole thing was a snow job. I have to give him this: As a yarn, it's a five-starrer. But if you think it's in any way related to real history, give yourself zero stars for not thinking critically. Then get out there and read some real history so you won't have the wool pulled over your eyes next time. :)
B000002UAX|5.0|Of all of The Beatles' later recordings, \\"The White Album\\" is probably the LP that is argued over the most.  Some people say that it is poorly put together and that the songs have nothing to do with one another.  I believe, along with many other people, that the quality of the songs and the revolutionary concepts of the album more than make up for this, and actually make the long running time and variety of songs give the album more character than any other album ever made.  Yes, I would say that this is not the best Beatles album, \\"Revolver\\" is the most consistent and \\"Rubber Soul\\" is a close second, but this 1968 release was just as important for the band, and receives just as much playing time in my CD players as the other great Beatles albums (all of them are great of course, even the under-rated \\"Beatles for Sale\\").   <br />     This album was suppossed to bring the Beatles together as a band and also bring them back to Earth after their previous albums.  \\"The White Album\\" did neither of these things, and it managed to increase the importance of the greatest band of all-time.  It is sadly true though, that the band was beginning to break up during the recording of this double LP.  Although this was the case, I still feel that this is the album that signified The Beatles as the most consistent rock band ever.  It is amazing how no matter what the circumstances were, everything they did was great!   Just think about if this album had been unsuccessful, they had spend close to a year working on it.  This album is also special to me because it is the only time in The Beatles' later years that my favorite Beatle, John, dominated the album.  Most of the best songs on here were written by him in India.   <br />     The album has also had great influence on just about everyone who has ever listened to and enjoyed it.  There was one definite bad case of this tho, which of course was not The Beatles' fault, when Charles Manson misinterpreted the meaning of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Piggies,\\" among other songs on here, but I don't even want to think about that.  It has influenced just about every other listener in a very good way, and if you haven't heard this album yet (are you kidding me?), you have to get this right now! <br />     I'll explain why some of my favorite songs on here are so good.  If I were to make a CD of just the better songs from the album, these are the tunes I would use (I am definitely glad that the album was released how it was though, it truly was revolutionary since there was so much material on it, among other reasons.  Even the lesser songs are not weak, just somewhat experimental).  I do think that disc one is slightly better than disc two, but they're both great and would have both been successful on their own.  Having them together seems to work best though, although the songs are unrelated for the most part, the album has a definite flow and great feel to it.  Here are my favorite ones:  <br />  <br />Back in the USSR:  McCartney making a Beach Boys and Chuck Berry salute/parody.  This song is an awesome way to kick of the album, just listen to it on headphones!  It's not complex but it's still Great. <br />Dear Prudence:  This song took a while to grow on me but now it's one of my favorite songs on here.  The guitars are great on this one.  John wrote this in India about a girl who would not leave the place she was staying in. <br />Glass Onion:  John is talking some nonsense on this one, but he sure was great at that wasn't he? <br />Ob La Di, Ob La Da:  This was one of my favorites when I was younger, I honestly think it's a little annoying now.  It is very catchy now.  There is an outtake of this on bootlegs and Beatles Anthology 3 that is actually superior to this version in my opinion. <br />The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill:  This is a fun song by Lennon.  A great sing-along if you're into that sort of thing. <br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps:  This is possibly Harrison's finest Beatle song, very well-written.  There is a haunting demo version of this on Anthology 3 that is definitely worth checking out, it's very stripped down.  Eric Clapton's guitar playing adds even more to this one.  He would have been credited for it on the LP jacket (which is awesome, by the way, very original), but their was a conflict between the artists' recording labels that didn't allow it. <br />Happiness is a Warm Gun:  This song is pieces together brilliantly and very well recorded.  One of Lennon's best vocal performances. <br />Blackbird:  In the case of the next stretch of songs on the album (side 2 of LP 1 on the vinyl version of this album), the whole is better than the sum of its parts.  This is probably the strongest individual song in this part of the album.  McCartney could come up with music like no one else.  This song really is great musically, and it is also strong lyrically.  Lennon was definitely the better lyricist, but Paul showed his talents on this one. <br />Rocky Raccoon:  And on this one!  What a great ballad by Paul!  This song shows some of the fun that the last couple Beatles releases had been lacking (Those albums are awesome too tho).  I definitely could have included more songs from this part of the album, but on their own they just don't stack up well against some of the other songs. <br />Birthday:  This is probably my least favorite of the songs I'm mentioning.  I just like how it was written on the piano since I'm a piano player. <br />Mother Nature's Son:  Paul making another great musical song.  John had a similar one to this called \\"Child of Nature\\" that wasn't included on the album.  The music to that later turned into his solo gem, \\"Jealous Guy.\\" <br />Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey:  This is a great little rocker by Lennon.  It's amazing how effortlessly they came up with songs like this. <br />Sexy Sadie:  Believe it or not, this is in my opinion the best song on the album and one of Lennon's finest works.  Musically this follows the same pattern and chord changes as many other Lennon songs, but it just comes together so good on this one.  This song took over 100 takes to get the sound Lennon wanted!  The lyrics refer mainly to Lennon's disgust with the Maharishi.  It is disguised perfectly and although this song may be an acquired taste, Lennon's genius shines thruogh perfectly on this song.  Sadly, the hard work spent on this song took a toll on the band, and could have caused some of the stress that later fueled the band's break-up (Yoko didn't help either, but you can't totally blame her for the band's problems, there was a large amount of frustration between all of the group members).  This is quite possibly the most underrated Beatles song (It is interesting to know that there were about 40 seconds of ending jam part of the song cut out of it on the final mix). <br />Helter Skelter:  This song truly started heavy metal and many bands based their entire careers on this song.  When the LP was first released, the stereo (which is heard on CD today) and mono versions of the album were very different.  This song was especially different in the mono version, that version was shorter and did not feature the famous line \\"I've got blisters on my fingers!\\" <br />Revolution 1:  This is a great song, and even though I prefer the single version, I really like this take as well.  There is another great acoustic version of this on \\"The Esher Demos\\" bootleg.  I think that Revolution 9 should have been used at the end of or right after this song (if it should have been used at all, I have mixed feelings about that, since John made it I guess it deserves to be there though).  The unreleased song, \\"What's the New Mary Jane?\\" could have easily been included around this point in the album as well, that's a very interesting song.  That's not a complaint tho, just a crazy idea.  This is definitely an album that does not need to be changed! <br />Cry Baby Cry:  This song is considered filler by many people.  I think it is clever and different from any other Beatles song because of the characters Lennon makes for it.  I love the acoustic beginning of this song.  The Beatles were so good at including an acoustic feel to some of their songs. <br />Good Night:  This is a bit \\"shmaltzy,\\" as John described it, but it is a nice way to end the album, very different from any other Beatles song.  Ringo was the perfect fit for this song.  This was a lullabye that John wrote for his first son, Julian. <br /> <br />Well there you have it, that's my overall take on a modern work of art, The Beatles' \\"White Album.\\"  Yes, although I didn't mention some songs like \\"Piggies,\\" \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road,\\" \\"Julia,\\" and \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" I am definitely glad that they were included on the album.  The Beatles' albums were so great and influential that it isn't fair to compare them to any other artists.  Even the Stones and Dylan falter when compared to the Beatles.  However, I have found it very obvious that \\"The White Album\\" is highly crticized, thats why i felt it was necessary to write a review for this album rather than my favorite, \\"Revolver,\\" because people need to see just how awesome this album is.  I would rank this album in the top ten album of all-time, and I have no objections when I see someone rank it #1.  The impact of this album will be felt for many years to come.
1559408855|2.0|I set out on a mission to seek out the most shocking films Amazon had to offer. Well folks, we've got a winner. And believe me, don't watch this while you are eating!!! I got physically sick (retching) while watching certain scenes. I guess the only redeeming thing about this film is that it shows us a side of human nature that is best left unexplored. The evil that comes with absolute domination of other human beings was adequately portrayed in this film, to the point that I had to ask myself if maybe the director isn't better off dead!

B0006L16N8|4.0|There must have been a fair amount of pressure in following up a great record like AROBTTH.  That being said, I'm not sure where \\"Speed Of Sound\\" came in the writing process but from that point forward things had to come a bit easier.  The point being that \\"Speed Of Sound\\" is a monster of a song and quite possibly the band's finest moment to date.   <br /> <br />The rest of the record is pretty typical Coldplay fare, \\"What If\\" is another great Chris Martin ballad while the fresh sounding and vibrant \\"Square One\\" easily becomes the band's best opening cut.  The anthemic \\"Talk\\" is destined to become a hit, and \\"Low\\" shows the band ratcheting up on the amps ever so slightly in a possible hint of what's to come down the road sound-wise for the band.  In fact, if theres one thing I would like to see from the band in the future it would be to tweak their sound and experiment more with different sounds and styles.  The americana-ish \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" is the only slight departure here and it works.  Hopefully it will inspire the band to push the envelope a bit more in the future. <br /> <br />Following up \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\"(one of the great sophomore efforts) couldn't have possibly been an easy feat for Chris Martin & co. but the band are up for the challenge and the result is another very solid effort.   <br /> <br />
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|This soundtrack is very different from that of the original BSG series.  The original series soundtrack seemed to have been inspired by the sweeping symphonic score of \\"Star Wars: Episode IV,\\" which was still fresh in recent memory when the orignal BSG series was created.  The old sountrack seemed to portray the quest for Earth as a grand adventure, but this new soundtrack gives perhaps a more realistic sense of a decimated population's desperate struggle for survival.  I won't review every single track on this CD, but I'll just give a brief description of my favorites. <br /> <br />Track 1: Prologue - the opening sequence of every episode.   <br /> <br />Track 4: The Olympic Carrier - From the episode \\"33\\".  That episode was clearly based on the events of September 11, 2001.  The music conveys tension and imminent danger as the grim decision is made to shoot down a civilian ship that seems to have been compromised by the Cylons and threatens the rest of the fleet, and also as Apollo and Starbuck find themselves in the agonizing position of having to execute the order to deliberately destroy a civilian ship, but only to save many more. <br /> <br />Track 7: The Thousandth Landing & Track 9: Starbuck Takes On All Eight - Both great tracks. <br /> <br />Track 22: Battle On The Asteroid - For me, this track alone justified the purchase of the CD. Pulse-pounding beats accompany the Colonial Vipers' assault on the Cylon asteroid base as well as Apollo's mad dash through the Cylon conveyor tunnel. <br /> <br />Track 23: Wander My Friends - Sung in Gaelic, but the CD booklet contains an English translation. <br /> <br />Track 25: Kobol's Last Gleaming - Another wonderful vocal piece. <br /> <br />Track 26: Destiny - The perfect accompaniment to Starbuck's desperate and lonely fight with Number Six. <br /> <br />Track 30: Main Title (UK version) - A real treat for American viewers.  Reminiscent (to me, at least) of the opening title of the movie adaptation of Tom Clancy's novel, \\"Patriot Games.\\"

B00005JNQS|5.0|Animation is a hot genre these days, thanks to the phenomenal success of Pixar's multi-million dollar blockbusters \\"Toy Story,\\" \\"Monsters, Inc,\\" and \\"Finding Nemo,\\" and DreamWorks' \\"Shrek.\\" These studio giants have opened the door for other, smaller companies like Blue Sky Studios to release innovative and high-quality movies, such as their first film, \\"Ice Age\\" in 2002, and their new, more ambitious endeavor, \\"Robots.\\"<br /><br />Visually, \\"Robots\\" is stunning, both in the look of the world and the creativity of its inner workings. The colors are vivid and the setup is ripe with potential for visual gags. The first half hour of the film is especially entertaining, beginning with Rodney's \\"delivery\\" as a baby. In the robot world, babies are delivered in boxes and are put together like children's toys at Christmas.<br /><br />The characters, led by an all-star cast of distinctive voices, are fun too, especially Broadbent's deliciously evil Madame Gasket and Williams's high-energy Fender, though I thought Williams could have been given more screen time and more freedom to improvise.<br /><br />The film's only weak spot, if you can call it that, is in its overzealousness to please. At times, there are so many visual elements, action sequences and gags going on at once, it feels as though we have no time to breathe. But, I applaud the creators for their passion for the project. I'd much rather see a studio go too far with its enthusiasm than not far enough. The film's storyline, too, could have been a bit more complex, but kids will love it, and parents will appreciate the complexity of the visual world in exchange for what it might be lacking in story. Overall, this film is a joy to watch, primarily because its cup runneth over with creativity and delight. It's obvious the creators put a lot of time and soul into it, and it paid off-- in spades.<br /><br />It's exciting, too, to see this level of animation coming more frequently to the big screen. Pixar sparked a new interest in animation with its release of \\"Toy Story\\" in 1995, and has bred an entire generation of animation lovers over the past decade with its subsequent blockbusters. This trend, in turn, has given companies like Blue Sky Studios, Fox, DreamWorks, and others an audience hungry for more of what they have to offer - and they are only too happy to deliver.rked a new interest in animation with its release of \\"Toy Story\\" in 1995, and has bred an entire generation of animation lovers over the past decade with its subsequent blockbusters.

B00006RCOB|4.0|What struck me about Firefox as I watched it for the first time in years was just how much there seemed to be a British influence on the script and the direction.  I had the opportunity to watch Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People on DVD prior to watching Firefox again, and there are a lot of similarities in style between those British TV mini-series and Firefox.<br /><br />While the quality of the script for Firefox doesn't come all that close to the scripts for Tinker, Tailor or Smiley's People, it isn't all that bad, either.  The scripts for those two landmark mini-series are considered to be two of the best espionage/spy story scripts ever written.  (My only complaint about those two mini-series was the direction and editing - they were paced too slowly, although Smiley's People was better on that count.)  Firefox, in comparison, is much faster paced and (of course, this IS a Clint Eastwood movie) much more action packed - but the movie doesn't rush in letting the plot points play out.<br /><br />Eastwood really stretches here as a director, going not for the action movie atmosphere, but rather more of a deliberately paced espionage movie - a bold move for an actor/director known best for his action movies (at that time).  The script might have needed a little more work, but it is more than serviceable and the story works well considering the time period when it was written.<br /><br />The ending is a very exciting sequence, and it is well handled with great special effects (for the time).  It is the payoff that action movie fans will love.<br /><br />Given the right expectations, Firefox is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  More than it is usually given credit for.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Having not seen the first Ghost In The Shell, I can't compare this sequel to the original. With that said, this film as absolutely stunning visually. The combination of 2-D animation with 3-D CGI is absolutely amazing and it sucked me in right from the start. The story is of Bato, a cyborg detective for the anti-terrorist unit Public Security Section 9 and his partner's (Togusa) investigation of a female robot (created only for sexual pleasure) that slaughtered her owner.<br /><br />The animation is incredible, but the story left a bit to be desired for me. The characters basically wax philosophical for most of the movie giving it a feel of falling in love with its own intelligence. The dialogue was like a game of quote poker - \\"I'll match your psalm and raise you one Milton and two Freuds.\\" This is not a knock on the film. I understood what it was going for with its search for a deeper meaning and symbolism. I'm just saying it could have been more balanced. Though staunch supporters of the film will say \\"any movie that engages your brain need not make any apologies.\\" This may be true, but I find that gratuitous intelligence can be just as bad or not entertaining as gratuitous sex or violence. This is far from a stupid movie, but those who will blindly support it just because it is a \\"smart\\" film shouldn't knock those who were expecting an action-packed film with deeper meaning as opposed to a philosophical film with some action.<br /><br />Now onto the DVD experience itself. Not having it dubbed in English is a big faux pas, but an even bigger mistake is having only one subtitle option. It was a hearing-impaired subtitle track where things like background noise, idle chatter, and rain popped up when you could obviously hear it. Was that enough for me to totally blast the film? No, but it did take the level of enjoyment down several notches, which makes the experience less fun. I understand the fan's passion and can relate to having nuances make a big difference, but the visuals are so lush and beautiful I simply can't totally pan the film for this blunder.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film with the real negative being the DVD presentation.ce, but the visuals are so lush and beautiful I simply can't totally pan the film for this blunder.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great film with the real negative being the DVD presentation. <br /> <br />
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Well if this is the career suicide some reviewers are claiming here then why the hell can't most bands do an album like this. This is first class abrasive stuff. The fact that this was done in 6 weeks makes it all the better if you ask me. There's complete urgency in them that was missing in the too-slick Discovery. Sure Discovery had its moments and very good ones at that too but some of them got a little too 70's disco pop for my liking. While it may never take the place of Homework as a classic it is still worth a shot. It's just a pity people have a certain expectation added by the fact that music magazines hold sway over a lot of people. The best tracks on here in my opinion are Robot Rock, The Brainwasher and Steam Machine which I find is not to everyone's taste. Keep an open mind on this one, you never know what might happen if you give something a bit of time.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I loved this movie! I want to get that very clear, and jump-start the review with high praise.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect at first with Daredevil. I've watched the trailer and read some reviews about it, but because it was another comic book story turned into a movie, I didn't have much anticipation of seeing it. Also, I really liked Spiderman, and in my mind, I figured Daredevil would just be another copy cat image of that success, and not do it very well either. I was so wrong; Daredevil is pretty close to being just as good as Spiderman.<br /><br />I appreciated the look of the movie, how we saw what Daredevil was seeing. It was a very imaginative and interesting concept, especially during the rain sequences. Daredevil is also much darker and more intense with violence and death.<br /><br />So, on a final note, I will not have to be dared to go and see the sequel. In fact, I can't wait!

While the overall structure could be \\"firmed up\\" and some repetition removed, it is still a provocative study of snap judgements and unconscious decision-making. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have confused two distinct issues:  The first one concerns everyone and how they unconsciously hold prejudices and attitudes, mostly cultural, that affect decision-making.  The second concerns those individuals who, after only a sliver of data, can discern truths that stun in their accuracy. The author stresses repeatedly that this second group is NOT a random group of folks from the local bar but is composed of experts in their particular fields - food tasting, military prowess, counseling, \\"reading\\" faces, tennis, insurance, art. etc.   <br /> <br />Many of his \\"solutions\\" for overcoming societal or cultural biases seemed fuzzy at best.  \\"Putting ourselves in situations\\" where we feel comfortable with all types of people sounds great but that is a conscious decision that one must make to affect our unconscious attitudes - a contradiction.  The many tests were interesting and revealing and while some may ask whether only examples were offered that supported the author's thesis, it is safe to say that he is correct in the germ of his argument.  <br /> <br />What I fault the author for is suggesting that anyone can \\"blink\\" like an expert.  That is simply not possible.  All the experts were highly qualified, most all highly educated with curious intellectual abilities not shared with the general populace. His most telling point is that studying of \\"blinking\\" decisions can lead to safer crime patrol, fairer hiring and other admirable societal goals.  A very worthy, provocative read.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I'm reading all these reviews which bash the album and yet give it four stars. What's that all about?  <br />Neil Young has never been the best lyricist in the world, and the lyrics to the songs on this album are just who he is. I guess it's kind of lame nowadays to be ecologically aware and talk about \\"mother earth\\". Oh gee, that's rather passe, isn't it? Neil is just who he is, and as honest as it gets. Meanwhile, the music sounds like Neil Young and Crazy Horse. It's got that sound that grabs you whether you like it or not. May not be very sophisticated, but neither is a good hamburger. It's just good, in a very visceral way. How else can you explain people bashing this album yet giving it four stars?
B00003CXSP|3.0|Does anyone know what opera Hannibal was at in Florence? I know the name of the song.
0143034901|1.0|Personal taste is, of course, very subjective but I must say that after all the scintilating accolades this book has garnered I feel like I have been reading a different book all together.<br />The Shadow of the Wind is as trite as it is convoluted. A lot of inplausible drawn out nonsense with sixteen year olds who behave like they are forty five and long pointless descriptions that go absolutely no where. One thing that really bothers me is why this book would want to use the voice of a turn of the century novel when it wasn't written nor does it take place at the turn of the century.<br />Seriously folks...<br />So...<br />If Andrew Lloyd Weber is your idea of great theater, this is a book for you.<br />Dostoyevsky?<br />In your dreams.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead is a British comedy that represents a spoof of the now popular zombie-movie genre that has movies coming into release quicker than you can say \\"Zombie Nation.\\" Although it pokes fun of movies such as \\"28 Days Later\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", and \\"Day of the Dead\\", it does so while still trying to be a horror movie. Well, kind of. For the definite fact is, this is ultimately a comedy through and through.  <br /> <br />Shaun lives in London in his humdrum world and his slacker, slob-of-a-roommate, Ed. Shaun has been experiencing some friction with his girlfriend because of his less-than-appealing style of living. Shaun's other roommate wants Ed out, but Shaun is reluctant to do anything about it, especially since he likes to watch television and go to the pub and drink as much as Ed does. While trying to patch things up with his girlfriend and getting his mind off his doldrums Ed and Shaun realize that the people who are stumbling around London are not in fact drunk, but rather ZOMBIES! They must make a plan to stop the influx of man-eating stumbling zombies that are packing the city, but all time, make sure they get some television in all the while. Shaun must also try to save his mother and girlfriend from the fate of the flesh-eating creatures.  <br /> <br />When I first saw the previews for this movie I was reluctant to want to watch it. It seemed like some lame comedy that would bring forth few if any laughs. I was very impressed, however, and this movie was much more than I could have anticipated. For one thing, this is not a movie that beats you over the head (pardon the expression, as the characters do beat the zombies over the head, but not my point) with laughs, but rather makes slight jokes at the expense of the horror-style genre. For instance, when Shaun and Ed first are encountered with the zombies approaching their home, they try to kill them using the sharp part of the Shaun's record album collection. However, rather than just flinging them at the zombies, they go through each one to make sure it is not one of Shaun's favorites. Awhile later, they are calmly having a discussion as they are pounding zombies with shovels.  <br /> <br />As one reviewer noted, the latter part of the movie is probably the part that drags a little and is not quite as humorous. Still, I felt like the movie was fun, and definitely a \\"popcorn\\" style movie (if you can keep your stomach that is). If you enjoy a good spoof, and especially if you are up with the zombie-movie flicks, this is one you should definitely try out.  <br /> <br />4 stars.  <br />
B00008J2DQ|5.0|who gives a flying flip whether or not it's repitive?...can you think of anything better to say about this album?...cuz if you can't, then you have no sense of musicality, and I praise those who like this band, ;cuz this album is spectacular at best. I loved \\"Awake\\" and I Still do...now, this album and the \\"Changes\\" DVD kick so much rear, it isn't even funny.. <br /> <br />great music, wonderful singing by Sully Erna, great-as-heck drumming by Shannon Larkin (one of my prime reasons for this album...great music...listen to it and decide for yourself, but for me?...i love it, so give it try...i'm sure glad I did <br /> <br />and for those that say bands like \\"Mushroomhead\\", \\"In flames\\", and (***om my god***)...(***commence tossing cookies***) NAPALM DEATH!!...are better...go shove yur face in a litter box, cuz they are just noise...just meaningless, musicless noise...and that...pretty much sums it up...
0789723107|5.0|I've been a professional web designer since 1992, and my web design skills evolved along with the technology. Before I was a web designer, I developed on-line user interfaces for large corporate computer systems, so I have always been sharply aware of the importance of designing a great user interface for any system. The web is no different - for a web site to be effective, it's not always about the slick, hot, flash-y graphics.  Sometimes simple common sense works best.<br /><br />Steve Krug's \\"common sense approach\\" is exactly that, packaged in a very wry and entertaining writing style with excellent visual examples with which he makes his points. There is SO much bad web design out there... let's hope some of those designers get this book, and take the hint!
B00005JMCT|5.0|American Wedding was the first Pie movie that I had seen (I wanted to buy Animal House, but it only came in a double pack with this movie, so I bought it anyway), and let me tell you...it's by FAR the best. <br /> <br />One of the things I love so much about this movie, is that there is never a dull moment. It hooked me from the opening music, to the nostalgic conclusion. It really showcases Seann William Scott's talent, and after viewing the first two movies, I just can't understand why they were so succesful without all that Stifler action.  <br /> <br />Another plus (which many think of as a bad thing) is the fact that characters such as Vicky, Nadia, and Oz are gone. That really made the movie for me. I just didn't like those characters, and I thought they brought the first to Pie's down. They're just so boring, and ditzy, and, honestly, repulsive. I barely got through American Pie, and American Pie II. <br /> <br />This is a fabulous movie, and you had better buy it, because you'll be sorry if you don't.
0385513755|5.0|Reading this book was one of those rare experiences for me when I found myself totally immersed in the story, instantly swept away... and saddened when it was over. I wanted MORE!<br /><br />Paris is going to be my adopted home in 2006, so not only did I enjoy the Paris setting and mentally touring the famous locations as the characters move around the city, but Dan Brown's ability to craft fiction interlaced with myth and fact (although there is much debate about which is which) makes him a superior story teller - and makes this story worth reading.<br /><br />I even requested (and received) the expanded pictorial edition as a Christmas gift this past December - which was even better, saving me a lot of time the second time I read the book (because the first time, I kept stopping to go online to look up the painting of the Last Supper and other references in the book.)<br /><br />By the way, check out the embedded CODED MESSAGE in the flyleaf description of the book...<br /><br />Don't analyze it - just read it and let it carry you away!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|1. Get Back - Obviously more punchy. The drums are brought in immediately, unlike Spector who faded them in. The fade out is much cleaner without all the mess. <br />4. The Long And Winding Road - The biggest change between the two releases.  This version shows Paul's voice being much cleaner and smooth instead of all the shakiness.  This is a different take with more drums and lead guitar.  There is an organ \\"solo\\" in the instrumental.  The strings blocked all of the magic that comes out in Naked. <br />10. Across The Universe - The tape is sped up to normal, the orchestra and choir are gone, no reverb, no chorus.  It's just John, his guitar, and keyboards perhaps. <br />11. Let It Be - The piano is more defined in this version.  It comes out in the interlude. <br />There are many other changes in the album, but these are the noticable changes that everyone will probably recognize.  This version clearly outshines the other as a true Beatles album.
B000002H33|5.0|In 1986, Metallica released their third album entitled, MASTER OF PUPPETS. Most fans have bragged about this album and they had every right to because this album is just amazing. The front cover of this album alone is just amazing. <br /> <br />BATTERY <br />  This is just the perfect song to start off this album. This is just a great song all the way and back again. <br /> <br />MASTER OF PUPPETS <br />  Don't you just love Metallica's title tracks? I sure as hell do. This is one hell of a classic Metallica song and it will be one hell of a classic for eternity. We all would like to know, from hearing this song and after reading ILLKER YUCEL's review, who in life is the puppet? Who in life is the puppeteer? <br /> <br />THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />WELCOME HOME (SANITARIUM) <br />  This song is just outstanding and the best on the album. This lyrics reveal a haunting story about a mental patient, but the story is coming from inside the patient's mind, which gives the song more of a reason to be haunting, since a mental patient is, as we all know, scary as hell. <br /> <br />DISPOSABLE HEROES <br />  A great song. This song was actually the first song about a soldier in war, where the song, \\"One\\", followed two years later. <br /> <br />LEPER MASSIAH <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />ORION <br />  This is another instrumental piece here, but the beat to this one is just amazing. Lars is one hell of a drummer. <br /> <br />DAMAGE, INC. <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />    I could not get over how amazing this album is. Every fan of Metallica's should already own a copy of this awesome album, if not, then hurry your a** up! The album is not getting any younger. Sadly, while on tour for this album, CLIFF BURTON, bassist for Metallica, died at the age of 24, while their tour bus ran into a serious bus accident. So, whenever you put on this album, yes, you may enjoy it because you all love it, but enjoy it for Cliff, since it was his last album withthe guys. Cliff, wherever you are, we all love & miss you dearly!
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This movie depicts the love as it is, with all its highs and lows.  Maybe bit strong on the lows.  But, it's wonderful because that is what life is.  True love begins with obsession and unexpected desire to know, the momentary curiousity that grows in you.  Closer captures that moment in raw, not missing any of the delicate emotional touches between two people.  It shows love for what it is; it's full-grown obsession for physical contact and possession, and its eventual dys-harmony.  But when all the desires and obsessions, and fantasies are played out, followed up to their ends, and when all things are done as the soul desires, then there is the inevitable, consequential end.  <br />This is a must see movie for anyone searching for true love.  True love never comes, and when it comes, you pass it by like a fool, following your fantasies. <br />I will probably watch this over and over, because it's so beautiful and sad.  Definitely worths the money.
B000002H2H|5.0|In 1984, Metallica had released their sophmore album entitled, RIDE THE LIGHTNING. This album turned out to be even better than KILL 'EM ALL. This album was definite in proving Metallica to be the best Heavy Metal act out there. This album has all the sound you could ever want from a Heavy Metal band. <br /> <br />FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE <br />This song is just astonishing. Any self-respecting Metallica fan would love this song. I sure as hell love this song. <br /> <br />RIDE THE LIGHTNING <br />Ah. The album's incredible title track. Can't get enough of this song and it sure can't get any better than this. <br /> <br />FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS <br />When I said it couldn't get any better than \\"Ride The Lightning\\", I was wrong. This album just keeps getting better, especially on this tune. Damn, this frigging guys can rock. <br /> <br />FADE TO BLACK <br />This song is my favorite off of the album. All I do is listen to this song a first time, then I start again for an encore presentation. If you listen carefully, you'll notice the song is talking about suicide. Gotta love this song. <br /> <br />TRAPPED UNDER ICE <br />Incredible. <br /> <br />ESCAPE <br />A great song with great lyrics and a rockin' sound. <br /> <br />CREEPING DEATH <br />As much as I love hearing this one, it creeps me out because of the title. But I can't help it when I just sing along with James on this one. <br /> <br />THE CALL OF KTULU <br />Instrumental song. <br /> <br />What an album! These guys know what fans want in a Heavy Metal album. This band is definitely going to be here for a long a** time. So get up off your a** and buy this album if you don't have it already.
B000001FGG|5.0|Actually, Cream was a blues band.  They were the first \\"Super Band\\", the term coined when they first played together.  They have been called \\"The Holy Power Trio\\" and changed rock music in a profound way in a manner somewhat similar to what Hendrix did to the guitar.  Cream was two rock bands.  One was the studio band that catered to the mass public who in general are spoonfed mediocre music to make money for large production companies.  The other band was the \\"live\\" band.  That is were Cream separated the men from the boys.      So far, there has never been a band that could play like Cream live, and the way it looks, there never will be.   Yes, in jazz you've had such groups such as Tony William's \\"Lifetime\\", the Miles Davis quintet, John Coltrane quartet, John Mclaughlin, and others, but this was rock.  Cream was doing something that had never been done before.  They were taking long, extended, improvisational jams that were truely extraordinary.  I personally have never heard any band ever duplicate or even come close to the what was done in \\"Spoonful\\".  I'm a drummer, went to Berklee, and have been playing a long time, so I feel I have some expertise in the matter.      Now, some people just can't hear what is happening in \\"Spoonful\\", and there is nothing that can be done about that.  But for those few people who can hear and understand what is going on, you will be amazed that anyone could have done what they did and with power.      It's true that there are a million zillion bands that were more popular and made more record sales blah blah blah, but what I'm talking about here is musical genius.  Those other bands might have sold more or been more popular, but in no way could they ever play like Cream, but there is no doubt that Cream could have played anything that any other band played. (That includes The Allman Brothers, Led Zepplin, The James Gang, Deep Purple, Jetho Tull, Grand Funk Railroad, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Ten Years After, Santana, and allthe others who could actually play their instruments.    Also, for drummers, \\"Toad\\" is a remarkable drum solo.  Ginger Baker tells a story with his drums, and it's amazing to listen to.  He uses double bass drums and incorporates them into the solo along with his playing in such a musical way that it's a true pleasure to listen to it.  In todays world of two bass drum players and double pedal players there are a lot of people playing a lot of technical wowie-zowie licks, but Ginger has them all beat on rhythms, taste, and creativity.      Bass players should take special note of Jack Bruce's playing.  Again, although there are people today that have more technical proficieny on the bass, I doubt seriously wether anyone could improvise like he did on some of Cream's live material like \\"Spoonful\\", Sweet Wine\\", etc.  There is more to playing than just a lot of fancy technique and Jack shows what that something is.    Then there is Eric Clapton back when he could actually play the guitar with fire, power, drive, and incredible creativity.  So much so that when listening to him at that time it's really hard to determine who actually was the greatest, him or Hendrix.  Somewhere deep down in the middle of Spoonful and Sweet Wine and the other live songs it becomes apparent that as much as Clapton has been epitomized as one of the great guitar players in rock history, he has actually been underrated, as foolish as that may seem.  But, just listen and decide for yourself.    So, if you want to hear the greatest rock band that ever existed playing the greatest live \\"rock\\" recording ever made ( Spoonful ), then I recommend getting Wheels of Fire and listening to \\"Spoonful\\".   Also, check out \\"Sweet Wine\\" on Live Cream Vol. 1 for more amazing playing that hasn't been surpassed.

B0007GAERG|5.0|I have enjoyed this album more than even I can imagine.  The more I listen the more I appreciate the talent. Incredible talent. The vocal runs are just spectacular, and the \\"finger on the pulse of current music\\", is on target.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I was always a firm believer in the quote \\"millions of people can't be wrong\\". That is until I saw this movie. Apparently, everyone giving this movie 4-5 stars are all wrong. To me, it seems people say this is a good movie b/c its the cool thing to say. I thought the mannerisms of Napoleon were annoying, and if he were in my school, I'd kick his @ss too. If you have poor taste in eclectic comedies, then this one is for you. However, if your looking for intelligent, offbeat comedy, I would highly suggest \\"Dead Man on Campus\\" and \\"Necessary Roughness\\" as two of the more popular films in the genre.     P.S. The only vote for Pedro should be for Pedro Martinez, to the all star game.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Even those who mocked Mariah Carey in the past can hardly fail to laud her wondrous vocals on her latest release, The Emancipation Of Mimi.  It is with forlorn nostalgia that we look back on her days of domination, believing she will never be capable of rising above the adversity.  Such was her malaise in the mists of the millenium, a series of events had brought her to the bridge of suicide. All very pitiful, but a shift in mood and circumstances has proved a turning point, and the 35year old issues a cameo finally worth her reputation.  The booty-shaking collaboration with rapper Nelly ( TO THE FLOOR ) , Gospel blinder ( FLY LIKE A BIRD ) and the 70`s revelry ( CIRCLES ) will propell her to status of greatness.  The hint of mere frustration ( MINE AGAIN ) later on turns into a frenzy of jubilation , JOY RIDE .    The entire feel of the album is that of an inspirational painting, ( YOUR GIRL )  and ( GET YOUR NUMBER ) .  Belief comes flooding into her veins and, with a dual purpose, serving as both a role model and a performer, presents the rattling ITS LIKE THAT.  The LP is steeped with uplifting party songs testimony to an undoubtedly great comeback, and overall  -   I recommend this album for all music fans!
B000002L99|1.0|Surely the popularity of the band didn't suffer, while their sound sure did.  From the opening notes of the instruments and the singing this sounds completely different from when they had the other singer/writer. This is the House of Pain. Which was the last song recorded on the album 1984.  Did they know something...!
B0000029GA|5.0|The name of Nasir Jones` debut.............ILLMATIC!  The title says everything, doesn`t it?  \\" Matic \\" , is a statement standing for \\" beyond good \\" !  Well, is it beyond good? , I hear you ask!  Put it this way, the album is as strong as Wyatt Earp clutching his weaponry menacingly at his sides.  Even in reality , Nasir Jones boasts a style akin to Wyatt Earp!Delivering quick and lethal blows, outweighing his oponents, containing political craft, armed with cool perception, then executing his mission with shocking, terrifying precision, Nas could well be 1994`s verbal assassin!  Like fellow Queensbridge emcees, he equally shared the intricate, movie - like lyrics which sparked much controversy surrounding the 20year old( NEW YORK STATE OF MIND) .   While representing a vast swathe of subject matter, he pays a compelling tribute to incarcerated peers, ONE LOVE.  The eruption of lyrical fury ( REPRESENT ) and the fraught LIFE`S A BITCH not only bore stark testimony to a positive message, but also exposes his diversity.  Monsieur Nasir Jones to take over from the ledgendary Rakim?  Impossible?  Think again!  Nas` rhymes are doing just that!  Progressively, the nudgers and whisperers of Hip-Hop imply that he may have blotted Notorious B.I.G`s story telling rhyme book, ( ONE TIME FOR YOUR MIND ) and believe who among the numerous rappers are equipped with such sophistication and tale granduer , than Mr Nas himself.  THE WORLD IS YOURS provides the outlet through which his vents his feelings of oppression, and appears as an inspiration for the young.  His first volume of memoirs chronicle his past events ( MEMORY LANE ) and IT AIN`T HARD TO TELL reveals he wields enormous influence within the kingdom of Rap.  His mastery of \\" Old Skool \\" iconoclasm, ( HALFTIME ) makes it all more the curious that NEW YORK`s latest emergent shows no glimpses of bureaucratic inertia.  Unfortunately, the number of tracks have raised a suspicion that Nas is another short-term aide who may be drumming up a medium of exchange in the presence of slum tenants.  But you must hail Nasir Jones, no longer vying for the crown, but greeted with honours and awards confirming his place in the pantheon of heroes. Bow down to the newly crowned king!  A soft touch ?  I think not!
B00005JNNZ|5.0|Samuel Jackson is one of the best actors in the world.  This film has a strong message.  NEVER give up on your dreams!  Coach Carter is the definition of \\"focussed\\" and is a man of principle, not afraid what the status quo will think of his methods.

BRAVO!! <br /> <br />
0061015725|2.0|A far cry from Crichton's better workds, Prey is disappointing. The thriller element is not lost, however, that's why I managed to complete it. Crichton does not seem to have read enough journals and books for this  one, because the usual high density and often disguised technical portions are sparse. Even when they occur they're inserted lazily.  <br />Everything from the beginning is predictable, if you've read Crichton before. The perfectly normal start, then the high tech link person or persons, the tech breakthrough somewhere around a third or the middle of the book, and finally everything going haywire towards the end. And oh, the mandatory dead people. This time, it's nanorobots which do the killing. <br />Crichton's artificial life forms seem to have everything, from vision to inbuilt memory. He goes on adding visual sophistication, audio response, solar power generators and blah blah whenever something become difficult to explain. AI learning? No problem!! They have memory. <br />Pretty unconvincing, primarily because it's not backed up by hard science. It's almost like a bad dream of The Andromeda Strain towards the end.
B000787WVK|5.0|This 2 CD set by DECCA is a re-release of a 1984 recording with a superb cast that boasts Nicolal Ghiaurov as Mefistofele, Luciano Pavarotti as Faust, Mirella Freni singing Margherita and Montsettat Caballe singing the role of Elena. What's to fault there? Nothing! This is a story of Faust (based on the drama \\"Faust\\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) who makes a deal with God in which he boasts that he can corrupt the good Faust. He succeeds all too easily. Faust makes the following deal with the devil: Mefistofele will serve Faust now in life and, in return, Faust will serve his soul to the devil in death - but there is a condition. Mefistofele must satisfy the unsettled spirit of Faust such that he will cherish life and utter the words: \\"Remain, for thou art fair\\". If it all sounds heady, it is. The score by Arrigo Boito (he wrote the libretto himself) is celestial, triumphant, inspirational and sumptuous, delivered magnificently by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of Oliviero de Fabritiis. Interestsingly, when this opera premiered in 1868 it did poorly, and prompted riots and accusations of stealing ideas from Wagner. Today, we're a little more sanguine about opera and appreciative of true music as art when we hear it, and as it should, Boito's Mefistofele has become an honored great opera. You would expect faithful digital reproduction on a CD and you get it here. The accompanying booklet is helpful with some history and a good explanation of what is going on in each act. If you own this opera on tape or record, you will want to add the CD to your collection for all the reasons digital recordings offer.
006055651X|5.0|This book is based on the novel by C.S. Lewis and is therefor not the actual text. It is a well written summary of the story, which can be read aloud in one sitting to young children without losing their interest. The book introduces them to the classic tale in a way that is appropriate for them. The text goes very well with the illustrations, which are gorgeous. It is written in a way that keeps the children wanting to turn the pages to see what happens to the characters. While it's true that the message of the story is diluted, it would be easy for an adult familiar with the novel to add little bits of age appropriate explanation here and there so the children get more of the intended message if they wish to do so.  <br /> <br />I really like this book, and have used it with my preschool class (children of ages 3 1/5 to 4) and with kindergarteners (ages 5-6). At first I thought it was a little risky because the text is much longer than most picture books we use with the younger ones, and some of the children have really short attention spans. But I also felt the story was good enough and the illustrations interesting enough to keep their attention. I was right. The children listened intently and wanted to know everything about the story. It was beautiful to see how even children as young as 3 were enjoying the tale by C.S. Lewis in a circle time setting at school. I recommend this book to parents and teachers who love Narnia and want to introduce it to young children who are not quite ready to read the original text.  <br />

B00005JMEW|3.0|Kill Bill: VOL.1 is an all right movie, that supposedly pays homage to older Japanese flicks of the past and spaghetti westerns later on in Vol.2. However, with all the hype that was going around this movie I was not expecting it to be any good, because; A): I'm not fan of this Quentin Tarantino directior of \\"Jackie Brown\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction\\" among other movies he directed in the 1990s or earlier (I was just a kid and I didn't like them). and B): Uma Thurman is not my favorite actress, nor someone I would've chosen to be the \\"Bride\\"/B. Kiddo. So When I bought the movie I bought it for one thing; the fight scene concerning the bride vs. Gogo, the swordsmen in dressed in black suits and Copperhead vs. The bride. Aside from that, the storyline and plot for the movie is flimsy at best. I would explain it but the storyline is just to tedious to even write about (color me lazy all you want), but I'll do it anyway. The simple way is that a woman whose name is bleeped out during the movie, only known as \\"THE BRIDE\\" wakes from her four year coma and realizes she is no longer pregnant with her child and wants to exact revenge on her former partners (all codenamed after Snakes) after years of slumber for a wrong doing done to her.   The first person she goes to is Vernita Green's (Copperhead) house and starts beating the holy crap out of her. However, the Bride and Green's battle is postponed when Green's daughter arrives from school a little earlier than expected. From there, the movie becomes a bore fest, but you'll soon be thanking DVD players for fast forward. Vivica A. Fox's character (probably the best next to Elle Driver) was killed maybe fourteen minutes into the movie after a short-lived and unexciting battle between Vernita Green (copperhead) and The Bride. The movie progresses from there in the format of the Bride's flashback presented in chapters that explained everything that had happened to her after waking from a bullet induced coma (including a needless background story for Lucy Liu's character O-Ren Ishii presented in crummy cartoon art, which made me wonder why they didn't do that with all the other characters the movie focused on), her trip to Japan to talk a retired blacksmith into making her a sword for her, up to the point where she heads to Tokyo to exact revenge on O-Ren Ishii (cottonmouth) is when the movie got majorly boring. After the bride beats the living crap out of the girl in the school uniform and the swordsman in black suits, the battle between Thurman and Liu (which was supposed to be the big fight in the movie) ended up being as boring as the flashbacks before it.   However, when you compare that fight to the two previous ones --- its going to look pretty stupid (I laughed when Lucy Lu lost her the top of her head, though). And that's basically the entire movie in a whole. Most of the music in the movie is cheesy, but it has its great moments (1): The scene in which the camera is up close on Uma's face (shudders) and this strange assortment of sounds strung together is playing in the back ground: I call it \\"Angry music.\\" (2): When the Bride calls out O-Ren while holding the woman who works for her hostage. That piece of music was nicely done and that was about it. Lastly the overkill with the loss of limbs and all the blood was basically the big drawer of the movie, but like someone said \\"You see on limb and bout of blood, you've seen it all,\\"; I enjoyed the movie only for its fights and two pieces of music, other than that this movie is pretty lame in terms of good writing, characters (exlcuding Vernita Green and Elle Driver), and storyline. ------- [a 3 out of 5]
B000003TA4|4.0|I bought their compilation, but didn't know if I liked a lot of<BR>those other songs. In my opinion, I rate this the best Nirvana<BR>album. When this album came out, grunge music was so popular! Everyone bought this back in the day of the release. I was only<BR>born when this came out. Anyway, Smells Like Teen Spirit is my<BR>favorite song on this album. Others great would be the other hits, In Bloom, Come As You Are, &amp; Lithium, (all radio classics).<BR>I used to like Breed, but all of a sudden, it isn't really that<BR>great, it kinda repeats itself. Then I like some other track like<BR>the slow Polly, and Drain You is okay too. I would have bought<BR>this back in the day of the release, which was September 1991,<BR>with other great albums, &quot;ON EVERY STREET&quot;, &quot;METALLICA&quot;, &amp; the<BR>&quot;USE YOUR ILLUSION&quot; records. Those 4 are all 1991 albums. Also,<BR>what was popular back in the day was Pearl Jam's &quot;TEN&quot;. The 90's<BR>rock your socks!! Anyway, it's a good one but not the best album<BR>of all time! I recommended you this, and I want you to buy my<BR>all time record, Dire Straits' &quot;LOVE OVER GOLD&quot;. That's all I got<BR>to say. Later.

B0002OERI0|5.0|If someone asked me what I thought of Green Day ten years ago, I would have said they were a bunch of punks who could write some catchy tunes but seemed utterly crazy. I would have never predicted back then up until now that this Californian trio could ever write an epic masterpiece that would stand out to become THE album of our times in the same sense that Pink Floyd, The Beatles or The Who defined their times with concept albums that will forever be remembered.     American Idiot can be easily compared to Tommy and The Wall in the sense that the album chronicles a fictitious character (St. Jimmy or Jesus of Suburbia in this case) through the times that America is currently living in. You can feel the frustration, anger, and disapproval of a generation in the 13 tracks of this mega rock opus. Like the two albums I've mentioned earlier in additon to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, American Idiot is the modern day concept album that will be remembered as long as there's rock 'n roll.    The title track, American Idiot, is the perfect way to open up the record as it signals the fact that Americans are consumed and brainwashed by the political Americanization system tool called the media. Billy Joe Armstrong, the band's frontman, with his engaging vocals and ripping lyrics describes those who allow the government to take over their way of thinking as idiots, but that's only another way of introducing the main character of this rock opera, a kid named Jesus (or is it St. Jimmy?) who refuses to go with the flow.    Jesus Of Suburbia is introduced quite well in the second track, a 5 part episode that shows Jesus as a typical dysfunctional American youth hooked on pop and Ritalin, smokes marijuana, is religiously clueless, and watches TV all day while his mom is out with who knows who. In City Of The Damned, Armstrong does some character background to show how lost Jesus is in a land that misleads to nowhere. With this, Jesus is outraged and this is revealed awesomely in I Don't Care, where he describes everybody as \\"full of sh*t\\" and how the land doesn't believe in him and how he just simply doesn't care anymore. The feelings of confusion deepens in Dearly Beloved where Jesus questions whether he (and the youth) is demented, disturbed or just retarded.     In the following track Holiday, one of the album's highlights, the war in Iraq is refered to a lot and Bush is called President Gazman. With Holiday, the frustration that Jesus of Suburbia is feeling has become a nation wide epidemic. Armstrong begs the public to \\"dream and differ from the hollow lies\\", the lies erupting from the pre-Iraq war of WMD's and so forth, adding more fuel to the fire of frustration of the American youth. On Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Jesus finds himself walking alone in search of the American dream that he was raised to believe exists, but only finds himself lost in the real world where the dreams are broken. Are We The Waiting is the youth questioning in added frustration who they are, where Jesus denies himself and begins creating a new image and a new personality, a more outraged and angry character named St. Jimmy. At this point, Jesus's, or Jimmy's, life starts changing. He meets a girl named Whatsername, who is described well on the catchy pop tune Extraordinary Girl, and gets hooked on novocaine to keep the pains of the past away, chronicled well on Give Me Novocaine. It's a family tragedy and the death of his father that brings him back to his conscience, the sweet and breathtaking Wake Me Up When September Ends was actually written by Billy Joe to commemorate his deceased father but the song fits well into the story of Jimmy. Jimmy snaps out of his over-the-edge second personality and returns to old self, the more humble and controlled Jesus of Suburbia as a result and like other people of his generation, he grows up. Jesus becomes a hard working employee on 12th Street filling out paperwork, but deep down inside his American dream hasnot been fulfilled. He'd rather be out and about again. He lost Whatsername because of his dramatic change and Nobody Likes (You) him anymore.  This stage in Jesus's life is chronicled completely in the 5 part episode of Homecoming, a stage where you sense the routine and boredom that has now over taken him just like every other typical American. Jesus has come full circle.    American Idiot is quite an engaging album in the fact that it sounds really good. Each track is a hit single in its own right despite its connection to the next one. Green Day have succeeded in inventing a record that tells a story from beginning to end while entertaining the listener with excellently produced and well polished catchy songs.     Definitely, the best album of our time.    Track picks:    American Idiot  Jesus of Suburbia*  Holiday  Boulevard of Broken Dreams  Are We The Waiting  Give Me Novocaine  Extraordinary Girl  Wake Me Up When September Ends    * includes all five (5) parts of medley    Highly recommended    A+
6304117272|4.0|Years before he decided to re-sink The Titanic, James Cameron took moviegoers on a journey that was part undersea adventure, part science fiction fantasy, and part political/social commentary.  Using the standard scenario of rescuers (the crew of an underwater drilling rig) becoming victims themselves, the director adds an element of otherworldliness by having extraterrestrials residing on the ocean floor.<br /><br />One of the movie's pluses is its top-notch cast.  Deciding against \\"big\\" names, Cameron assembled a talented cast of familiar faces that could add credibility to an otherwise implausible tale.  Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are equals as a divorced couple that is brought together by work and the eventual struggle to survive.<br /><br />Rounding out and providing great support are the members of the crew: Leo Burmeister, Todd Graff, John Bedford Lloyd, Kimberly Scott, and J.C. Quinn, as \\"Carfish,\\" \\"Hippy,\\" \\"Jammer,\\" \\"One Night,\\" and \\"Sonny,\\" respectively.<br /><br />Michael Biehn, who had previously starred as the hero in Cameron's earlier works \\"The Terminator and \\"Aliens,\\" sports a moustache as he plays a paranoid Navy Seal that becomes the film's \\"heavy.\\"<br /><br />The optical effect that would be so memorably displayed in Cameron's later \\"T2: Judgment Day\\" was in its infancy but it still impresses as alien-controlled ocean waters \\"morph\\" into the likenesses of Harris and Mastrantonio.<br /><br />Included on the cassette is a short featurette  detailing how the actors spent many arduous hours training for underwater filming and it was work well spent.  One could actually believe that they knew exactly what they were doing.<br /><br />Though not a great film, \\"The Abyss\\" ranks as a enjoyable viewing experience and comes highly recommended.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is byfar one of the better movies ive seen in my lifetime. Although the sequel was dissapointing, this movie can capture the viewer and keep them interested for the full duration of the film. The movie is mysterious along with good action sequences. Most movies cant have a good plot along with the action, but this movie is in the league of LOTR, gladiator, and saving private ryan, in which it combines a rich plot with great action.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 starts off as a frivolous comedy with a bunch of insane, eccentric characters, and only later on you realize that there is a method to this madness, and the pieces start falling in place.     Yossarian - the main protagonist who is a bombardier in WW II - refuses to fly any more missions after having flown seventy, a number which Colonel Cathcart (who lives in his own world of imaginary triumphs and catastrophic imaginary defeats) keeps on raising.  He is then presented with a very tempting offer which he decides to decline after having seen from close quarters that \\"there are people cashing in on every decent impulse and every human tragedy.\\"     Though the entire novel is very well written and fun to read, the climax is absolutely unbelievable. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|The action in this movie is exhilirating and even better than the action if bourne identity. However, this movie just didnt seem as exciting and mysterious to me as the first one did. The first one kept you interested, first time I watched this movie I had trouble paying attention. It just doesn't meet the level of the first movie. I can understand how people with that all-action personality can praise this movie, but for the insightful movie-goer who seeks a strong plot, dont waste your time with this one.
6304981635|5.0|I don't get tired of this movie no matter how many times I watch it. Right from the very beginning with the spiritual discourse between Lee and the master (\\"when the opponent expands, I contract, when he contracts, I expand; and when there is an opportunity, I do not hit, it hits all by itself\\") to the final showdown between Lee and Hahn in the hall with mirrors, this movie is absolutely captivating.    The bonus features in the DVD include some original commercials for Enter the Dragon (interestingly calling Lee the Martial Arts champion of the world), and the famous interview of Lee taken by some Canadian Journalist in Hong Kong in which Lee talks about his views on movie making, prejudice against Asians in Hollywood, and his own personal philosophy with gems like: \\"Be like water, my friend,\\" and \\"Under the stars, we are all one race, it just so happened that we look different.\\" Sadly, this turned out to be Lee's last movie as The Game of Death hardly has ten minutes of Lee's footage. People like Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, Steven Seagal, Jet Li, Van Damme, etc., should be eternally grateful to Bruce Lee that he made movies like these before he died.
B000001EL7|4.0|Love gun was my first cd and i still like it. It was an album that came out when they were in their mid 70s popular era and it doesnt dissapoint. I would reccomend this album.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Wow.  This is one of my favorite films of all time!  I saw 28 Days Later and loved it.  I have been wanting to get my hands on this for a long time, but never got a chance.  This movie is SO funny.  The jokes keep flying, but you'll need to search for them sometimes.  Any one who's seen this movie probably gets my review title (Ed's farting joke).  The plot is simple.  Shaun and Ed live together and Shaun has a rough relationship with his girlfriend Liz.  After their break-up, zombies start attacking.  So Shaun's mission is to save his mom, get Liz and go to the Winchester Pub and, as Shaun would say,\\"wait for all this to blow over.\\"  If you like zombie movies, comedies or both, this is definately one to add to your collection!
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the lightning is awesome. Its my favorite metallica cd so far. My favorite songs are fight fire with fire, ride the lightning, and fade to black. I would definately reccomend u to buy this one.
1573229725|5.0|Fingersmith is another amazing novel from Sarah Waters. At first I thought I would find the language a little tedious for me but it turned out to be beautifully written. The atmosphere she creates is great and the characters are just so loveable and engrossing. I don't want to give anything away, but this is the first novel that made me go @#$*!@#$)! in the middle of the night really loudly and that says something. It was really well written how the first part was in one girl's view, the second was in the other's and the third both. Basically, it's a very very engrossing story with twists and turns. I most definitely recommend this book!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I couldn't believe this CD was all that as all the reviewers were reporting.  IT'S LIKE THAT is indeed an infectuous dance track, but WE BELONG TOGETHER took me back to the first time I was introduced to Mariah in the 90's.  So I went out to purchase the CD and couldn't find it anywhere.  Everyone was sold out--which meant I HAD to have it.  And boy, am I glad I finally purchased it from Amazon.  This CD is ALL OF THAT and bag of chips.  Mariah teamed up with some great tracks and producers for this one and it undoubted proves that the DIVA MIMI is here to stay.
0345442970|4.0|Cloak of Deception is a very political book. Instead of the great Jedi action Star Wars fans have come to know, this book is really about Sumpreme Chancellor Valorum and the corruption that plagues his administration. If you are not a avid star wars fan you will not understand what they are talking about. Cloak Of Deception takes place mere months before The Phantom Menace. It explains how the Trade Federation blockade comes to be. It gets deep into the rule of Sumpreme Chancellor Valorum and the corruption surrounding him. In this novel, Senator Palpatine of Naboo is portrayed as selfless senator offering support to the Chancellor through his tough times. Though his other identity (Darth Sidious) is present in the book, he does not play the major part that of his political alias. Luceno does a good job of showing how the events in this book fall into place in The Phantom Menace. Until the inroduction Of Qui Gon and Obi Wan the book is quite dull. They save this book with great duels at the end. Without the action from them or any of the other Jedi this book would've been lucky to receive two stars.
0783225881|5.0|Having said this (my title) I am a lover of this wonderful sport, and think that this here is the greatest sports movie ever made, with Hoosier's a close second. <br /> <br />We all get to a point in our lives when we feel the magic and wonder in this world is gone.  The adventure we felt, growing up.. when everything was so much simpler and purer.  There's something inside each and every one of us that long's for a simpler way of life, and yearns to break out of the rut we find ourselves in, working day to day, same thing over and over again.   <br /> <br />This wonderful movie is based on the incredibly well written novel by WP Kinsella, Shoeless Joe.  For anyone who hasn't read this and loves this movie, don't delay.  Back to the movie, there are so many reasons to love this movie.  Ray Kinsella, the farmer in the corn field who hears the voice, \\"If you build it, he will come,\\" is your average, ordinary, every day joe.  And his life is turned completely upside down by this incredible vision he has one day in his corn field.  The \\"he\\" of the earlier statement, is at first percieved to be the great Shoeless Joe Jackson.  Joe Jackson was a member of the infamous Black Sox team of 1919, who were accused of throwing the World Series, and were banned for life from the game of baseball.  Ray believes that by building this field, he, and the other members of the Sox will be able to come back and play baseball again.  To \\"write an old wrong,\\" as Ray states. <br /> <br />Ray sets out on an incredible journey, going all over the country to interpret this revelation.  The way the story is shot, with Ray going between reality, and dream like moments is incredible.  You can't help but get goosebumps when he meets up with Moonlight Graham in Minnesota.   <br /> <br />At the end of this movie, Ray ultimately realizes that the field wasn't built for Shoeless Joe to play ball again, but rather for him to share that moment with his father that he never did, a simple game of catch.It's a beautiful story that can have even the most seasoned movie goer in tears at the end.  <br /> <br />This movie is so wonderfully produced, and is one of my 10 favorite movies of all time.  I watch it every year, come baseball season, and at least a couple times later in the year too.  We all need this movie, and the ideals it promotes.  There is a simpler way of life, and we'd all be better trying to obtain it! <br />
B0000CBHOI|2.0|Yes, the previous reviews are correct - limited footage of performers (and the audacity to narrate over footage instead of allowing the viewer to listen firsthand) and a selectivity that is baffling and, sometimes, offensive.<br /><br />The bigger problem is that the series suffers from some major historical blunders. As much as each presenter is attempting to chart the history of the 'blues', its antecedents and forebears, there is little attention to the history of blues scholarship which informs the research attempted by the series. Blues scholarship has a history - one decidedly romantic, grounded in a 1950s/60s record collector attitude which has foregrounded some objectively insignificant artists in their time (Robert Johnson) and studiously ignored tremendously influential ones (Lonnie Johnson).<br /><br />Typically, 'Feel Like Going Home' grounds the blues entirely in the Delta, and neglects to consider the popular blues 'queens' of the 1920s like Ma Rainey who had an enormous influence. Indeed, the 'blues' is here reduced to folk music, with the 'integrity' and 'spirituality' that this term has come to imply. There's no real mention of the blues being a form of pop music for its time, and that performers like Robert Johnson openly pillaged from records with shameless aplomb. Indeed, contemporary musician Cory Harris is seen ridiculing 'other musicians' who attempt to reproduce exactly the 'spontaneity' of Johnson's recordings - his so called 'interjections' (i.e. 'Can't You Hear the Wind Howl?'). Excuse me, Mr. Harris, but as Elijah Wald has demonstrated in his 'Escaping the Delta', Johnson's alternate takes include all these 'spontaneous' asides in the same place, with similar delivery - suggesting Johnson used them with conscious, technical precision. Blues was as much the product of a slick, orchestrated pop sensibility as it was a means for communal expression.<br /><br />This is but one example of how Scorsese's 'The Blues' attempts to definitively 'place' the 'blues' - in some instances kicking and screaming - within a fairly stereotypical generic category of authentic 'folk' music dealing chiefly with personal expression and suffering. And, to be sure, there's truth in that - but it robs the music of the complexity identified by Wald: complexity which makes the music far more interesting, and its history far more fascinating.<br /><br />So, ease into these films with a degree of skepticism. Do some broad reading first, and one HELL of a lot of listening, before taking this series as 'the gospel'. As this series demonstrates, the past is constantly being redefined to suit a specific (even unconscious) critical agenda, and it's up to the listener to determine the difference between black cat bones and mojo hands...vely 'place' the 'blues' - in some instances kicking and screaming - within a fairly stereotypical generic category of authentic 'folk' music dealing chiefly with personal expression and suffering.

B00097DX3U|5.0|Chris Cornell and friends have truly out done themselves on \\"Out Of Exile.\\" Now, that statement seems to push the rest of the group into the background, which is not at all intended. Tom Morello, Brad Wilkes,and Tim Commerford are as much a part of Audioslave as is Chris and together with Chris add awesome and unforgetable music to Chris' wonderful lyrics.  <br /> <br />\\"Out Of Exile\\" is a bit more positive and a little less heavy than their debut album, \\"Audioslave,\\" was. This comes from Chris' slightly more positive lyrics on songs such as \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Out Of Exile\\", \\"Dandelion\\", and \\"Yesterday To Tomorrow\\". But, make no mistake, the bite, anger, and self deprecating style is still there on \\"Your Time Has Come\\", \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", \\"Drown Me Slowly\\", \\"The Worm\\", \\"Man Or Animal\\", and \\"The Curse\\". I personally think it makes for a more balanced album than the debut, which, by the way, I think is brilliant.  <br /> <br />Chris Cornell has a gift for lyrics like few people have ever had in rock/pop music. His lyrics strike deeper into the soul of the listener than most writers. I love the verse in \\"Be Yourself\\" where he says \\"Someone gets exited in a chapel yard and catches a bouquet. Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave.\\" What a wonderful contrast of emotions this elicits, even though the overall feel of the song is positive. Yes, just be yourself. That's all that you can do.  <br /> <br />I think the mistake we listeners/fans often make is that we expect to hear the same thing over and over again. We expect to hear another album just like the debut. BORing! \\"Out Of Exile\\" is a little different than \\"Audioslave\\" but if we listen to it without comparing it to \\"Audioslave,\\"  I think we fans will appreciate this brilliant offering as much or even more than their first album.
B00005LOLD|4.0|Sayonara has all the problems of 50s Scope blockbuster doorstop novel adaptations and Joshua Logan films both - slow pacing not the least of them - but still works despite it taking nearly an hour for the lovers to meet. But for once the soap operatics seem to be there to support the film's surprisingly daring criticism of the US Army's racist policies rather than its sole raison d'etre, and it's hard to imagine a major studio today making a mainstream big-budget picture with A-list stars about, say, American troops falling for nice Islamic girls. Brando is at his worst here, clearly bored with the part he plays up the Southern stereotype to such a simple downhome clich that he comes across more like Steve Martin as the Jerk doing Elvis rather than a successful West Point career officer, but a strong supporting cast - an understated Red Buttons (unjustly slated by Pauline Kael for some reason), James Garner and Kent Smith - take up the slack, and MGM/UA's DVD is such a stunningly beautiful transfer that it's easy to get sucked into it. Shame about the impromptu press conference ending and Ricardo Montalban's ah-so turn as the world's tallest Kabuki actor.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Even though this C.D. came out last year, I am only now just reviewing it because I wanted to make sure it was good. I was sort of lukewarm on it at first, then I listened to it again and I didn't know what to think about it. Finally, I listened to it a few more times and, even with repeated listens, I think it's Slipknot's best album to date.<br /><br />I'm sure almost all of us know the story behind this album, but no review of \\"Vol. 3\\"would be complete without a little summary of Slipknot's history. Most considered their sophomore effort, \\"Iowa,\\" a commercial and musical disappointment. In addition to being called \\"sell-outs,\\" the band members took some time apart from each other. Three side projects (Stone Sour, Murderdolls, and To My Surprise) cropped up (plus guitarist Mick Thompson was supposedly in talks about creating a side project), and rumors were circulating that the Knot was untying. But then, in August 2003, the nine band members hunkered down in a Los Angeles studio, with super producer Rick Rubin (who produced such albums as \\"Reign in Blood\\"), and began work on the new album.<br /><br />I think the time off they took (to explore other musical venues) definitely did Slipknot some good. Some old school maggots hate this album and were alienated by it, but both newcomers and fans who listen with an open mind should like \\"Vol. 3\\" quite a lot. Some Slipknot diehards will hate me for saying this, but if you listen to this C.D., you will hear some Stone Sour influence. Stone Sour is Corey Taylor's side project which debuted in 2002, and \\"Vol. 3\\" isn't quite like Slipknot meets Stone Sour, but the new Slipknot songs do have cleaner, more musical guitar riffs, and even some acoustic ballads. Plus, even thought I don't hear all 9 members on \\"Vol. 3,\\" it does sound a lot less cluttered and cacophonous than \\"Iowa.\\"<br /><br />Even though it's up for debate whether or not Slipknot show their true selves on \\"Vol.3,\\" it's not up for debate that this album proves that Slipknot know how to write good music. After hearing \\"Iowa,\\" I sure didn't think Slipknot were headed in a more melodic direction; thus \\"Vol. 3\\" was a big surprise. It has more of a classical metal influence: in addition to some acoustics, guitarist Mick Thompson (and his counterpart, James Root) solo a lot more here than they ever did in the past. \\"Vol. 3\\" is more radio ready, and not as intense or raw as their past albums, but it is also not nearly as out-of-control or crazy. Plus, much of the music is still heavy. Mick and James still know how to lay down some powerful riffs, and there are some songs (i.e. track three) that will please old school fans. So, this album has a new sound mainly because of Corey's newfound melodic vocals (most of his singing here is on the melodic side).<br /><br />1. \\"Prelude 3.0\\" is like an intro, with just some soft strumming and a laid back drum beat, while Corey continuously drones the line \\"Now it's over.\\"<br />2. \\"The Blister Exists\\" has a thrash flavor to it. It has good chug and churn riffs and pounding drum work. The vocals switch back and forth between yelling and spoken word, and the end of this song has drums which sort of echo \\"Stomp,\\" the musical.<br />3. \\"Three Nil\\" gets quite loud and noisy. The guitars, drums, and vocals go all out and make pounding rhythm. This is one of the songs that should please old school fans.<br />4. \\"Duality\\" is the lead single. Corey described it as \\"Slayer meets Ministry,\\" and I'd say that's a pretty fair comparison. After the spoken word intro, the beat kicks in and the guitars chug. Corey's low voice sings calmly, and the guitars become almost bobbing and punching (which should make this song a good headbanger). There's some clean backing vocals in the chorus, and I enjoy the subtle speed change around the 3:15 mark.<br />5. \\"Opium of the People\\" has a very weird beginning with high pitched, bubbly, beeping guitar noise. The first verse has a fast, almost vibrating (but non-dominate)riff, and this song eventually changes to a bobbing beat with punching guitars.<br />6. \\"Circle\\" is the first ever Slipknot song to feature acoustic guitars! Corey sings melodically, making this song quite pretty and very much in vein of the Stone Sour single \\"Bother.\\" A catchy drum beat finally begins around three minutes and forty seconds into the song, but it ends abruptly thereafter.<br />7. \\"Welcome\\" has stop-start riffs with simultaneous drumming and Corey makes a screaming entrance. The beat remains staccato throughout the verses, but then there are two guitar solos (the first of which is rather wild and all-over-the-place).<br />8. \\"Vermilion\\" is the second single. There's a \\"ding ding\\" sound at the beginning and end of this one, and the rest of this song's tempo is fairly slow (with no speed changes). The drums sort of drive the beat early on, even with chug and churn guitars, but another good guitar solo is included (which might be this album's best).<br />9. \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" was probably written just for live shows. This song, which has another pounding rhythm, is dedicated to Slipknot's fans, and has several more careening guitar solos. But, even still, this track comes across sort of sounding like filler.<br />10. \\"Before I Forget\\" has more good, thrashy, toe-tapping riffs. Most of this song is brief splashes of machine gun riffs, but there's a good melodic part and the big, catchy chorus makes this song fitting of being \\"Vol. 3\\"'s third single.<br />11. \\"Vermilion Pt. 2\\" is the second acoustic driven ballad on here. This one has two guitars and two vocalists, making it sound not as much like \\"Bother.\\"<br />12. \\"The Nameless\\" has another choppy beat with bobbing riffs, and some DJ scratching. This song twice breaks for a brief acoustic segment; after the second time, the beat becomes more continuous and not as choppy.<br />13. \\"The Virus of Life\\" has catchy, stomping drums (which, at times, sound like a clattering of heavy boots), and a few more DJ scratches. The guitars eventually come on and make a couple of crunchy riffs, and I enjoy Corey's ascending vocals (he builds to a yell, while repeating the line: \\"This is the virus of life\\").<br />14. \\"Danger-Keep Away\\" opens with an instrument that could pass for a piano. Some distant vocals and a slow drum beat eventually begin, and Corey croons some more. Another vocalist joins Corey in the second half of this song, and sings in unison with him.<br /><br />Now, I would not call this album \\"brilliant\\" (as Corey described it), and I don't blame some longtime Slipknot fans for hating \\"Vol. 3\\"; but I'm very glad Corey and the gang took some time off after \\"Iowa,\\" and took their time when writing this album. The bottom line is all metalheads should definitely check this one out and listen with an open mind, because \\"Vol. 3\\" is one of the finer metal albums of 2004.

B00005JKWJ|3.0|No point in rehashing the plot, so many other reviews already do that.  So I'll just stick to some points in the film that made no sense.<br /><br />* Blade's vampire allies are upset to learn that Blade plans to use UV light weapons against the Reapers (a kind of super-vampire), because UV is harmful to Vampires too.  So the Vampires are wary of handling UV weapons.  BUT ... these same Vampires are heavily loaded with body armor.  In fact, early on in the film, they infiltrated Blade's lair while dressed in full body armor, everything covered from head to toe.  So, why can't they use that same body armor when handling UV weapsons?<br /><br />I guess because they're really stupid vampires, since they only wear full body armor when they DON'T need it.  But when they go in with UV weapons, they foolishly don't use it, and naturally, many of them die.<br /><br />* It's established that only UV light will kill Reapers, unless you can perform a very difficult sword trust to the heart.  So naturally, even at the film's final end battle, all the stupid vampires, and even Blade, only fight the head reaper WITHOUT UV light weapons, shooting countless useless bullets at the reaper even though they ALREADY KNOW it won't have any effect.<br /><br />* How come there are NO female reapers?  You become a reaper by being bitten by one.  Now, vampires have traditionally prefered biting women (and reapers are a kind of super-vampire),  yet there are NO female reapers.  So, are reapers gay?<br /><br />For that matter, there are VERY FEW female vampires.  Only two among dozens and dozens of male vampires.  What gives?<br /><br />For that matter, in UNDERWORLD, there were NO female werewolves.  How come all these supernatural societies have so few females?  (Is that why they're always after our women?)<br /><br />* The entire cast is really one-dimensional, most of all Wesley Snipes as Blade.  Leanor Varela is a bland female lead in this film, but was quite good in THE TAILOR OF PANAMA as a scarred former freedom fighter.  Ron Perelman was better in ALIEN RESURRECTION, showing more dimension despite playing a similar jaded tough-guy.  So it's not like these actors can't do better.AILOR OF PANAMA as a scarred former freedom fighter.

0679428895|5.0|I was disappointed when I finished Pompeii.  Sometimes books are like that.  I enjoyed it so much: learning about life in Rome in the first century, discovering the engineering wonder of the aqueducts right down to the degree of slope necessary to carry the water, discovering what an aquarius was, seeing the warnings that Vesuvius was sending, and then enjoying the \\"romantic\\" element that intertwined with the \\"mystery, murder, mayhem\\" scenario.  Pompeii was a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience for me that I didn't want to end.  I'll have to re-read this one.  <br />
B00005JLKB|3.0|I wasn't a viewer when the first season of Smallville aired on television, so I rented the set last weekend after hearing great things from several friends. I have to say that I was disappointed. <br /> <br />One of the biggest problems is that Smallville has deja vu syndrome; that is, it seems to develop through certain situations but reverts right back to where it came from. Case in point: Clarke decides he wants to go to a concert with Lana. Although it is interrupted, they have a good time and get closer. In the next episode, though, Lana is still with her boyfriend and she and Clarke are written as if nothing has happened. <br /> <br />The freak-of-the-week setup is another problem. For almost every episode, some person develops some weird problem thanks to meteor leftovers. This affects Clark (or a friend/family member) and he saves the day. I realize that many good shows have formulas, but that's rediculous.  <br /> <br />The acting from almost everyone is quite good, but some of the cast members have trouble overcoming clichd characterization. The best examples of this are Clarke's parents-- you can practically predict the words that will come out of their mouthes. <br /> <br />I liked Smallville enough to watch the second season, but if it isn't any better I won't be continuing.
B0008ENHTE|3.0|The streets of San Francisco are mostly empty, especially during the two-car chase sequence for which \\"Bullitt\\" is famous. Sometimes errant cars get in the way (the same green Volkswagon does three times) or a parked car is sideswiped. But where is the 24/7 traffic that bedeviled drivers in 1967? And  drivers always find parking spaces in a city legendary, even back then, for its lack of them. In \\"Bullitt,\\" the camera treats cars, whether they're driven or parked, the way John Derek used to treat Bo.     Airplanes on runways are also lovingly lensed. The good cop (a taciturn Steve McQueen) and the bad guy run around shooting at each other between planes  taxiing to lift off. Inside the airport, in a tense sequence leading to this climax, something is awry: all the arriving and departing passengers are well-behaved and impeccably dressed; you look vainly for a few rumpled travelers, a single flower child flying on something other than speed. After all, this is the hippiest of cities in the swinging sixties.    Cars, planes, clothes - - - but I digress, easy to do when revisiting this cult cop film in its latest, extras-ladened transfer to DVD. Although we admire the way it tries to tweak the genre, \\"Bullitt\\" doesn't earn its reputation. The villain is an arrogant politician (a spot-on Robert Vaughn) who is so transparently devious that his colleagues appear to be deaf and blind, and it's frustrating when he doesn't get a proper comeuppance (Bullitt, at the end, is merely rude to him.)    Cutting the scenes with girlfriend Jacqueline Bisset would actually improve matters. Are they there to establish Bullitt's heterosexuality in this gayest of cities? At one point, when she meets him at a murder site, she pouts, bolts from his car and complains about the \\"sewer\\" he works in, as though he were not fighting to make the city safe. We've seen this whining helpmate to heroes in other movies, but it's still disconcerting to see such talent wasted playing one here.    San Francisco does sparkle, its beautiful bay views and architecture shot in early morning light (doubtless why the streets are so empty.) The pre-CGI car chase is genuinely gripping. And Peter Yates does have directorial flare, cutting quickly away from a scene or letting another continue seconds after it's over, creating an expectant ambience. \\"Bullitt\\" isn't boring, but maybe it's best that we recall these \\"classics\\" without actually rewatching them. Why risk the letdown?    Postscript: don't miss the full-length documentary \\"The Cutting Edge\\" included here on the second disc. It's an excellent and entertaining review of who is really responsible for scenes that move or excite us in the movies: the film editor. \\"The Cutting Edge\\" has had a theatrical release and is also available separately, so it's a real coup to discover it among the self-congratulatory extras that try our patience in the \\"Bullitt\\" package.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Mess with sombody else's wife and it could cause some problems. Then, one should beware of Greeks bearing gifts.<br /><br /> It's become an axiom that films have to do killer numbers in their first three weeks or they are considered less-than-successful. Well, the reviews weren't real kind to this movie, and maybe the weak initial receipts were the reason. In truth, it wasn't that bad. It is actually a fairly entertaining version of this story (compare to 'Helen of Troy' 1956). As befits the presentation of an epic, the director made good use of technology (there actually seem to be thousands of ships and thousands of soldiers), and presented battle scenes that appeared both realistic and interesting. Those involving only two combatants were particularly impressive due to some fine choreography. Yet, this film suffered from an unbalanced approach with an unnecessary emphasis on sentimentality overall and an inattention to the more important themes from Homer's original epic. It could have easily been re-named \\"Achilles,\\" so much of the movie revolved around his character rather than the destruction of the ancient city. Pitt did an acceptable, if a bit too rigid, job of playing that role but at times hurt his own performance when he couldn't seem to decide whether he should speak aristocratic English or American vernacular. The adaptation also could have been more genuine. After all, if it is decided that Achilles is going to take center stage, then there should at least be a reference or explanation concerning his vulnerable heel. Similarly, the most telling aspect of the original tale, the events surrounding the Trojan Horse, were treated here almost as a necessary afterthought. The final words of the narrator merely reinforced that this movie was less about Troy than a few of the more important warriors, when he said, 'Troy is gone, but those names will be remembered.' Good supporting performances from Peter O'toole and Brian Cox overcame some of its weaknesses, but this could have been a better movie. Having said that, it was more enjoyable than critics led me to expect. It's still worth your time.
B000002MM8|5.0|excellent poesy, you should listen it looking at a sky with stars.
B0002VEWA6|5.0|It took me a while to get into this film.  Blame it on an ogre with a Scottish(?) accent, an ethnic donkey, and a a bit too much information about bodily functions.  Definitely kid's unalloyed stuff.  But, deep down inside, I'm a rebel and a romantic, and very gradually I found myself cheering the lovelorn troll as he heads out on a quest to find someone else their one true love.<br /><br />So mule and ogre head of across their world to defeat a dragon and rescue the beautiful princess.  Only the princess has a few surprises, Shrek's feelings get jumbled up, and nothing is quite what it should be.  If you've ever thought you were the ugly duckling, if you ever felt you weren't quite good enough, this film is for you.  For once, the fairy tale is turned upside down, we are reminded that beauty is what's under the skin, and yes, that ogres need love too.<br /><br />This isn't a deep film, other than that it takes aim at all the phony and superficial values that people mistake for what's really important.  And that it does very well despite it's declared preteen audience.  Its message is universal, and it's reverse charm is infectious.  For all its fairy tale mimicry this is as much a film for the disillusioned as it is for anyone else.<br /><br />The animation and music are excellent.  Characters are expressive and the writing takes repeated jabs at many of our fondest icons.  This is a laugh and feel good film, and we don't really get enough of those.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah Carey has reigned supreme as pop music's No. 1 diva (one upping Whitney and Celine by writing most of her own material) and it's easy to see why: the girl can sing.  Not only sing, but sing with a voice more powerful than any -male or female- in the business today.  Here, on her comeback effort entitled The Emancipation of Mimi, she overall succeeds to standing applause but loses some points for the overusage of rap and hip-hop artist collaborations.  She sounds her best on songs she and only another writer co-wrote as opposed to mixes featuring the likes of Nelly, Twista and Snoop Dog, songs like \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Circles.\\"  Tunes like that let her show her amazing five-octave voice to full effect; listen to first single and opening track \\"It's Like That\\" and you could think she's any female R&B singer.  Emancipation truly has set Mariah free, and on this record she can make any listener do so too.  Great job.
B000002IWL|5.0|`Crosby, Stills and Nash' is a classic case of the sum of the parts being greater than the whole. When this album was released in May of 1969, all of the main players had achieved a degree of notoriety. What they brought to this project was a talent matured and seasoned by Stephen Stills in `Buffalo Springfield', David Crosby in `The Byrds', and Graham Nash in `The Hollies'. While it may be tempting (and presumptuous)to contend that what CS&N wrought was something completely different, never before had such a mix of divergent styles blended together so effortlessly, and with such a distinctive and savory result. Couple this with the great cultural significance of the album, and the sheer quality of the compositions and performances, and you have one of the epic albums in rock history. <br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' defined a generation. More than any other single work, this album defined the ethos of the Baby Boomers, The New Left, the counter-culture. While their 1970 release `Deja vu' played on the `hippie mystique', `Crosby, Stills and Nash' elucidated it. No longer tied to established values, this generation would live to emulate lyrics such as \\"Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now\\", \\"Listen not to what's been said to you\\", \\"Seagulls circle endlessly, I sing in silent harmony, we shall be free\\", \\"You are living a reality I left years ago, it quite nearly killed me. In the long run it will make you cry, make you crazy and old before your time\\", \\"and then I will lend you my will and your days will be filled with love\\", and \\"Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness\\". To what degree were these artists mirroring society as opposed to creating a mindset? Certainly a bit of both. <br /> <br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' offered an eclectic mix of sounds. While the performances in this debut album are certainly categorized in the folk or soft-rock category, subsequent interpretations of numbers such as `Wooden Ships', `Pre-Road Downs', and `LongTime Gone' divulged their heavy-rock potential (check out Stills' version of `Wooden Ships' on his 1974 `Live' album). Virtually every song is a conservatory of vocal harmonies. While Dallas Taylor (seen peering out the window on the album cover) contributes percussion and David Crosby rhythm guitar, the lion's share of the instrumental work is single-handedly Stephen Stills'. Stills' lead guitar solo's, both electric and acoustic, are imaginative, inspired, and at times, such as on `Pre-Road Downs', rabidly innovative and unparalleled. <br /> <br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' harbors a wealth of creative genius, from the bold alliterations of `Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' (\\"Lacy lilting lady, losing love lamenting\\") and `Helplessly Hoping' (\\"Wordlessly watching he waits by the window and worries'), to the dynamic,desperate exchange between warring soldiers introducing `Wooden Ships' (\\"If you smile at me I will understand, because that is something everyone does in the same language\\"), so pertinent to the Vietnam era. Stills offers five compositions, including a co-credit with Crosby on `Wooden Ships', and there isn't a loser in the bunch, though `49 Bye-Byes' gets a save from Crosby and Nash's steep and ascendant harmonies. Crosby is in his prime, cataloging the beautiful `Guinnevere' and the ominous `Long Time Gone', this album's complement to `Deja vu's `Almost Cut My Hair'. `Lady of the Island' is Nash's `Guinnevere', and `Pre-Road Downs' and `Marrakesh Express' give the body of work a much-needed buoyant lilt. <br /> <br />`Crosby, Stills and Nash' is a close to perfect as the men, the times, and their resources could impart. It is nothing if not an essential componant of any comprehensive modern music collection. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album has to be Mariah's strongest effort to date. In this album I hear in Mariah's vocals what I heard in her first 4 albums- her joy of singing. She really seems to have passion in this album that was lost in her work after \\"Butterfly\\", I love Mariah and I think she is the best singer around, I have all of her albums, but to be honest I think she trailed off with \\"Rainbow\\" and then collapsed with \\"Glitter\\". I just dont think her true love of what she does was with those releases. It seemed kinda lazy. Maybe it had to do with her tremendous success. She was on such a high, but what goes up, must come down. In fact she crashed with \\"Glitter\\". And everyone loved it..except her true fans (myself included). With \\"Charmbracelet\\", it was mediocre at best, but it was the start of a new chapter for her. Now with \\"Emancipation of Mimi\\", she's back to where she finished off with \\"Butterfly\\". The first release \\"Its Like That\\" was incredibly catch and I couldnt believe it was Mariah I was hearing. I knew it was the start of something great. Then \\"We Belong Together\\" came out, and its just such a beautiful R&B ballad that I dont think anyone else can sing it. It also became her 16th number 1. I believe this has become already a Mariah classic, like \\"My All\\". Then there is \\"Shake you off\\" which is good but not really all that great. Then comes \\"Mine Again\\", and oh does she SING it! I was astonished at the jazzy influence of it and the real instruments in it. I love how you feel her vocals in this. Then there is \\"Say Something\\" which is just as catchy as \\"Its Like That\\" with Snoop Dogg. Then the other song that was produced by Kanye West \\"Stay the Night\\" which takes you back to like the Jackson 5 times, and Mariah stays on top of her vocals on this. She doesnt let up, she proves why she is probably one of our generations best female vocalists. Then the songs \\"Circles\\" and \\"Fly like a bird\\" are just great vocally. There are couple of songs that are fillers but it doesnt takeaway that Mariah has found her love and passion again. That is truly what you find here in this CD. I believe that this album is Mariah's best to date! I believed with her failures, it gave Mariah something to strive for once again. And I guess the world has welcomed it. Its really nice to know that after you fall, you can stand up again. You wont be disappointed with this CD.
B0009R03NI|4.0|'Welcome To the Canteen' is one of the more intriguing albums to come out of the psychedelic era of rock and roll. The band wasn't quite as loosely assembled as say the 'Super Session' trio of Stephen Stills, Mike Bloomfield, and Al Kooper, but nearly so. In-and-out-again Traffic co-founder Dave Mason is in at this point, but only for a handful of concerts. Frontman Steve Winwood had also augmented the original Traffic line-up with journeyman drummer Jim Gordon, who was making the rounds with Eric Clapton and George Harrison, and percussionist Reebop (wouldn't you love to know if he wears Reebox?). Once Mason flew the coop this band would be primed to record its seminal work, 'The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys', but for this moment in time, the stars aligned in a most illuminating way.  <br /> <br />Two of the more intriguing tracks on this disc are the Dave Mason compositions, 'Sad and Deep As You' and 'Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave'. Both are stellar works fresh from Mason's 1970 solo debut album, 'Alone Together'. It's marvelous to hear Mason perform these songs so near to their inception, and with such a fine line-up of backing musicians. The tempo is slow, but the emotion is high on each. Chris Wood's flute on 'Sad and Deep As You' is beautifully understated, while Mason's guitar work on 'Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave' is stunning. Reebop and Jim Capaldi's percussion on both songs provide yet another nuanced layer to appreciate.  <br /> <br />There are three heavy rock numbers on the disc, each possessing its own unique flavour. The opener, 'Medicated Goo' is rather fun and funky with sharp, driving guitar riffs. The two longest tracks on the disc made up the entire second side of the original vinyl version of this release. 'Dear Mr. Fantasy', one of the band's trippiest numbers, lacks some of the psychedelic twists and turns endowed on the studio version, but possesses the finest guitar solo's on the disc. The closer, 'Gimme Some Lovin', drawn from Winwood's mid-60's stint with 'The Spencer Davis Group', is nearly as percussion heavy as the original single version of the song. Perhaps the presence of three percussionists in the line-up prompted Winwood to feature this nine-minute extravaganza on 'Welcome To the Canteen'.  <br /> <br />The remaining performance is a six-minute plus version of the popular, early Traffic composition '40,000 Headmen'. I must confess that I've never understood the appeal this song seems to have for many Traffic fans. A number of versions exist... it turns up on nearly every Traffic compilation and live release there is. I'm sure the problem must be me, since the song receives frequent accolades in reviews. With my personal disclaimer in mind, I will say this is one of the more appealing versions of the song I've heard, possessing a smooth acoustic flow.  <br /> <br />The only flaw possessing 'Welcome To the Canteen' is the quality of the recording. Even given it's unique qualities, I'm a bit surprised Winwood and company saw fit to release these tracks. The vocals on 'Sad and Deep As You', while clear, sound as though they are being delivered by Mason from a nearby cave. The vocals to '40,000 Headmen' suffer a similar fate early on. The vocals on the nearly eleven minute 'Dear Mr. Fantasy', and on 'Gimme Some Lovin' are simply overwhelmed in all the instrumentation. These flaws give the recording a near-bootleg feel... but at least you know it's real.  <br /> <br />'Welcome To the Canteen' was the sixth release by 'Traffic', following three studio albums, one compilation, and one mixed-bag ('Last Exit'). It's an interesting snapshot of a band in deep transition, clearly mutating from their present into their future, yet firmly grounded in their past accomplishments. The liner notes are rather sparse, and we're not treated to any bonus tracks, though you gotta believe Island Records is sitting on some more gems from the two UK shows these tracks are gleaned from. One wonderswhy a CD with only forty minutes of music couldn't be supplemented to woo the faithful.  <br /> <br />
0446310786|5.0|Like others who have reviewed this book recently, I was never assigned this book to read in school.  And like many readers, I usually bypassed it.  The classics were most often requried reading in school, and too often were more than difficult to get through.  However, I had seen the movie starring Gregory Peck and agreed with recent polls that it is one of the best ever made.  Given that the books are usually better than the movies, I finally succumbed to my own curiosity and picked up a copy.  My very literate friends were surprised that I'd never read it before. <br /> <br />As is customary with books written decades ago, this one starts slowly, builds slowly, sometimes seems even plodding.  But as the story unfolds, the reader learns about the characters, many of them, primary or secondary, even background.  No character is less than fully developed.  No incident is trivial. <br /> <br />Placed in a small southern town, life is very nearly ideal for children growing up and going to school.  But even in such a venue, evil can lurk in the shadows, as Jem, Scout, and their friend Dill discover.  There are ancient mysteries, secrets, and people who aren't quite who they seem to be.  Others are exactly who they seem to be, like Atticus, gentle, intelligent, sometimes feeling old, but never compromising his principles.  His son, Jem, beginning to feel less like a child.  Daughter Scout, not quite the lady her aunt Alexandra wants her to be.  Dill, their best friend who comes every summer to stay with his aunt.  Most of all, Boo Radley, the recluse, whom the children would give almost anything to see. <br /> <br />Every word, every scene, every character makes this a most readable book.  It is timeless and a joy.
B000002U82|2.0|I was maybe, 17 when this album came out. Me and my friends were all into music and would proudly play our new albums to each other and go to the big concerts. I was the perfect target market at the time and I already liked pyschedelic music by Hendrix and others but somehow I could never get into this album and still don't care to listen to it even though it has been impossible to escape from at times. Maybe it was all the clanging clocks, the \\"listen to what my new synth can do\\" tracks or the chick in the shower vocal exercise that really turned me off, though there are some good pieces of music contained here; all this stuff just seemed like sound effects junk to me, and I can't really recommend this album as whole.

It flows like cool spring water over mossy rocks and slides right into a resting river of peace and tranquility.  Divine and spiritual.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Sorcerer's Stone was good. Chamber of Secrets was better. But Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the by far the best in the Harry Potter movie series!    One of the things that I felt was an improvement was the change of directors. Alfonso Cuarn is, without doubt, a better director than Chris Columbus. The Prisoner of Azkaban book was a lot darker than the first two books, and Cuarn did a wonderful job on incorporating this feature into the movie. Columbus, in my opinion, was a little too loyal to the books, which can get a little bit boring because you know what to expect. Cuarn, however, used his imagination and created a film that was loyal to the book, but also was very original. Cuarn put events into the movie that forshadow future events, such as the scene in which Ron and Hermione are standing together looking at the Shrieking Shack, and Malfoy and his gang are teasing them by saying that they are out looking for their dream home. This scene suggests that Ron and Hermione may become a couple in the future. Cuarn moved the crew to Scotland, improving the realism of the outdoor scenery. The lake in front of the castle is now a river. Hagrid's cabin now sits on a hill farther away from the castle. The Whomping Willow has been moved to a new location and looks more realistic. Cuarn added a rickety, wooden bridge crossing a gap and leading into a courtyard in front of the castle. A giant clock tower stands in front of the courtyard, and in some of the scenes you can see the giant pendulum swinging back and forth. Cuarn also changed the way the school uniforms look, and the cast members spend more time in their everyday clothes. This movie is shorter than the other two movies, as there are not as many Quiddich scenes. There are no slow scenes in this film, which is good because they can get a little boring. I didn't like the book all that much, but this film is really great! I hope that the upcoming fourth movie is just as good as this one.    Thismovie introduces several new characters. We meet a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, played by David Thewlis. We see the Divination teacher, Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) for the first time. And of course, you can't forget about Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) or Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall). Sir Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. They have a new Fat Lady (Dawn French). And we see smaller characters such as Parvati Patil and Pansy Parkinson. Plus, wait until you see Buckbeak. He looks so realistic it is almost impossible to belive that he is computer-generated. The dementors look more decayed than I imagined them to be, which is good, and the werewolf is so scary it will make you jump out of your seat!    The one thing that was left out of the film was the the true identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. But they still have four films left to explain that little detail, so I'm not too worried. I would recommend this film to any Harry Potter fan, and if you enjoy this movie, try out the video game, which is just as enjoyable.
B000002UR7|5.0|I bought this on cassette tape when it first came out (I have no idea why) and proceeded to burn the tape out listening to it over and over. I bought The Bends later and was sorely disappointed. SO much so that I have been extremely reluctant to buy any additional records by these guys. If Pablo Honey is the anomoly, so I am reading here, then I guess I made the right decision.  <br />In any case, if you let the CD stand on its own, and forget the comparisons with the rest of their output, I don't see how you can not like it. Everyone else is right, it's much more than Creep. If you give Creep 4 or 5 stars, then you'll give every song on the CD 4 or 5 stars (well, OK maybe a 3 star here and there, but the whole thing really is quite solid, unlike a lot of albums.)
B00005JMEW|4.0|In summation, Kill BIll is a great movie.<br /><br />Now for the plot line:  The Bride - played by Uma Thurman, goes on a killing spree to exact revenge for the act of murder perpetrated at The Bride's wedding rehearsal.<br /><br />At first viewing, this movie is strange, full of fantasy - can you really fly on a plane with a samurai sword?, and it is like a western samurai movie.  After getting used to seeing this movie I began to think it is one of most daringly original pieces of film I have ever seen.<br /><br />Some of the reviews here say the movie is boring - perhaps they want constant action.  I think Tarantino is not only a brilliant action sequence director, but a really great observer of dialogue.  When O-ren (played by Lucy Liu - do NOT bring up her heritage!!) says to the Bride, \\"Did you really think it would be that easy?\\" and The Bride says \\"for a moment there - yeah, I thought it would be that easy!\\" we are hearing great stuff.  What preceded that moment is a bloody but beautiful fight scene.  Why beautiful? Because I have rarely seen moments on film with the kind of choreography that those scenes exhibited.  It was like \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" well, yeah, except for the bloody limbs flying around and the spurting blood.  However, after a while it seemed that the blood was not gore but rather comic.  It's like a big inside joke after a while.<br /><br />This movie is different.  Since the movie mimics Asian films, and the setting for Kill Bill is like many Asian martial arts movies of the 1970's, it seems natural that having an Anime segment to explain O-ren's background seems logical.  It just works.  But, what also works here are the little touches.  The scene when The Bride fights O-ren is incredibly beautiful.  This scene made me believe that Tarantino is a great filmaker.  The snow wafting down in this garden, with the fountain making its sounds \\"ssshhhh tt tt\\" is a little touch that many may overlook, but the fact that its there is a little touch showing the care Tarantino gives to his films. O-ren dressed in a geisha outfit with a samurai sword in white - like a bride, and yet The Bride dressed in a yellow track suit? It sure seems to make no sense, but maybe that's the point?  Damn, it is just beautiful filmmaking.<br /><br />What can be funnier then the 88's attacking The Bride with those masks?  What is more incongrous then the band in the club doing mediocre covers of American rock songs of the mid-60's? Who can think of the necessity of creating a myth about the Hanzo Hattori sword?  Who can forget the line of O-Ren being exposed for an airhead (hehe) and saying - \\"you were right, it was a Hanzo Hattori sword!\\" Who would think of why The Bride drives in a pickup truck with a vulgar term for a woman pasted on the back?  Who is Bill and why did he kill The Bride?  Like may martial arts films, we aren't told the why, but the how, when and where get answered.  And like many martial arts films, the point is the journey, not the end.<br /><br />Basically, this movie is a homage to Asian martial arts films where nothing makes sense but they are great fun.  So what?  It is entertainment, and if you enjoy film as an art, I think you will enjoy Kill Bill immensely.  If you are expecting a non-stop slasher movie then I say rent Friday the 13th, Part 1005 and be done with it because there are many moments fraught with thought, attention to detail and dialogue.  However, to be sure, Tarantino is a major film talent.  How can we be sure? Because like Hitchcock, Fellini, Peckinpah and others whose films are immediately recognized as being only the work of the particular director, you are darn sure that this film is pure Tarantino.  Sure Tarantino obviously ripped off many scenes and concepts.  So does EVERY artist. The trick is to rip off someones work and make it outrageously your own.  Given that Tarantino is so well thought of with only four films to his credit, and his influence already so widely felt, it is noleap of hyperbole to say he has had an impact.  With Kill Bill, he has truly taken another major step forward in making a genre his own.<br /><br />This movie is a pleasure to watch, because in my opinion, we are watching an artist at work.so widely felt, it is no leap of hyperbole to say he has had an impact.

B000002LCX|5.0|I`ll just say that i got the queen is dead, meat is murder and this one on tape in the nineties, and for me this is the best one.I don`t want to skip a single song of it when i put the cd in my stereo.For me this is the most complete, accesible subtle and beautiful smiths album.Morrissey and Marr agree too.They were two different geniuses on their own, but here they join efforts to make lyrics and music sound  as a whole,sounding much more experimental than in their other releases and later imitated by many.Essential 80's album.

B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack will have you wondering what took you so long to add it to your collection.  It is not only divine, inspirational and spirit-filled, it is also melodic and peaceful.  It fills up your soul and washes over you in gigantic soothing waves of pure harmony.<br /><br />It fits the picture perfectly and tugs at your heart.  A true joy and a total, complete listening pleasure.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I bought this album when it launched, and I've listened to it at least 20 times.  Unfortunately it never truly..... \\"Grew on me\\".  Yes it does take some time to get used to, but to the reviewers that say, \\"Listen to it at least a thousand times and then it will become your all time fav\\" needs a reality check.  Basically they are trying to say that the album is overrated and they can't accept the reality that, \\"THEIR BAND\\" released an album that still needed work.  Accept it & move on... <br /> <br /> <br />1) Square 1: 9/10 (Very good opening track & Should have been the Album Title) <br />2) What If: 7/10 <br />3) White Shadows: 8/10 (Lyrics are OK, but the music saves it) <br />4) Fix You: 7/10 (If you are in a good mood then by all means skip it! But if you are having a bad day then it does pick you up) <br />5) Talk: 10/10 (Just as good as Speed, but won't get the coverage. Very good Guitar on this track.)   <br />6) X&Y: 0/10 (That's right 0/10.  Its Puuuure TRASH! I have listened to this song the most over and over AND OVER, but I don't understand why people like this?  Can I please have what they are taking?) <br />7) Speed of Sound: 10/10  (Turn on your radio, its there...)  <br />8) A Message: 5/10 <br />9) Low: 5.5/10  <br />10) The Hardest Part: 3/10 (Better than X&Y but that's not saying much) <br />11) Swallowed in the Sea: 8.5/10 (Excellent Ballad, Lyrics are actually good and the music compliments it as well) <br />12) Twisted Logic: 6.5  <br />13) Till Kingdom Come: 6.0 (cover song, its OK but I didn't appreciate it like others have posted) <br /> <br />Bottom line - I am a Coldplay fan.  I've seen them in concert already, (They are AWESOME in concert!) but I'm not going to overhype an album just because I'm a fan of the band.  Yes people will strongly disagree with my review, but its my opinion & I think it gives a better perspective than listen to this 100 times and them you will be happy on your investment... PEACE!
0553382179|5.0|I found this book and the internet program behind it to be less about organizing the home, and more about organizing the home-maker, just exactly what I needed!!    Creating daily routines, day of the week routines, and monthly zone focus has made my housework flow more smoothly-  and is making  my entire home the peaceful refuge I have always wanted it to be.    Marla's encouragement to let go of my excess stuff and finally love myself is a continuing help in my home and life.    I've seen some reviews stating how silly and unnecessary this book is.  To those readers I say This book was not written for you.  Any more than a basic arithmetic book is written for a college algebra major.  It was written for me and the millions like me who look at the mess and just can't think straight.  We who need to learn from the ground up what you already know.    Motivational and down to earth,  \\"Sink Reflections\\" has been a help for thousands, perhaps it's the answer for you too!    If you're in a mess, feeling overwhelmed, lacking focus and looking for answers-  Sink Reflections and Marla Cilley could have just what you've been looking for!
B0009KA7BS|5.0|dont listen to any of the moron 1 star posters, they all complain that this is not a scary horror movie. thing is, this movie is not a horror movie you twats. This is more of a theological-sci/fi movie. There was nothing in this movie that disturbed me much, it was a well done movie, based on a comic book.<br /><br />i really liked this movie, and felt like i had to review it once i saww the streak of 1 star reviews, that could very well be all the same person.
0790733226|5.0|Contact captivates from the first moments and never lets go. It's one of my all-time favorites, that I view over and over again. It's poetic and spectacular--an awesome movie--and Jodie Foster is wonderful as the ever-searching Ellie Arroway. Matthew McConaughy is quite the hearthrob, too. (I love his gorgeous curls and dimples!) After watching this movie, I had to get Carl Sagan's book. Zemekis has captured the essence of the book but for those who hunger after more I highly recommend reading the book as there's so much more to the story and the science that couldn't be told in the movie, especially the trip through the wormhole (taken by several people, not just Ellie) and the sections about the number pi. Simply fascinating.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I liked this movie. is matrix kind of action and good vampire movie I seems pass few years ..But DAMN this DIRCUT is sooo over priced. Never seens this price or paid that much for any ,New releases or old  movies in any where!! ...Cheapest did find in Internet world was $23.00, But DAMN, still is high price.I guess wait around till around Halloween. Get it under $18.00, I bet this price in here no one really going to buying it!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|If you are wondering what exactly this film can be compared to, I would have to say Memento or Donnie Darko. The writing in this film is phenomenal, as Trevor(played perfectly by a 120 pound Christian Bale) leads two lives, and both seem completely real. I don't want to ruin the plot, as many other reviewers have been right in doing so, but from the beginning it seems apparent that Trevor is encountering a series of events repeatedly. As the film progresses,  a sort of mystery develops in which someone is toying with Trevor. I've seen plenty of original movies that have been destroyed by an ending that seems like a cop out. This film ends perfectly, as everything is wrapped up nicely, and it seems as though the writer had it planned out for months in advance. <br /> <br />Basically, if you like original movies that are different from the normal day fanfare, give The Machinist a try.
B00005JOGE|5.0|Don't listen to the previous reviewer, Paul (if you can even make anything out of his terrible grammar and spelling). Having watched the Live 8 concerts all day, I can say it isn't just a concert (although it's probably the best concert I have ever seen and I only wish I could have been in London to watch it live). This is a message of peace and ending poverty in Africa. Military force is not the answer. The reason Africa is having problems is because of debt reparations. It is forced to repay its debt to the US and other countries by buying weapons from the US and is not allowed to use any money that the US or other countries have given to Africa to establish schools, hospitals or any other critical, foundation infrastructure the country needs to bring it out of its depression.<br /><br />As far as the concert itself, it was simply stunning. For me, it really didn't get any better than watching U2 and Keane perform. Bono and Tom Chaplin are absolutely stunning performers, feeding off the energy of the crowd to really put power and emotion into their performances. Hopefully, all of the concerts will be produced on DVD in their entirety to truly capture the energy and the message of the events.
B00000254B|4.0|Barbra S is no Callas or Sutherland but this record is very pleasant listening. The items are well chosen to match her voice and she performs them very well. The items are from the classical repertoire, her voice isn't but who cares;its a great record to relax with.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I can't believe what an excellent \\"multi-layered\\" actor Robin Williams has become. I'm not thinking of his leading role in Popeye, but his most recent accomplishments in: One Hour Photo, Jakob the Liar, and now this --alongside Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding, Jr. I hope Robin continues to perform in multi-layered pscyhological roles that honor the Creator God. Annabella was fantastic in this also...  <br /> <br />Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra star in this visually stunning metaphysical tale of life after death.  <br /> <br />Neurologist Chris and artist Annie had the perfect life until they lost their children in an auto accident; they're just starting to recover when Chris meets an untimely death himself. He's met by a messenger named Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and taken to his own personal afterlife--a freshly drawn world reminiscent of Annie's own artwork, still dripping and wet with paint. Meanwhile a depressed Annie takes her own life, compelling Chris to traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair.  <br /> <br />The best sequence in this just may be how the evil entities just give up after they realize that Chrisy (Robin Williams) is earnestly trying to save another out of pure love.
B00003CXCT|5.0|At long last the orginal Star Wars trilogy comes to DVD. And boy has it been a wait, but was it worth it? Well to say that this is anything but spectacular would be a lie. What we get is the three orginal \\"super\\" special editions of the trilogy on dvd along with a fourth bonus disc featuring lots of goodies.    Now the first thing you will ask is if these are the orginal classics I saw in the theater back in the 70's and 80's and the answer is no. Nor are these the special editions we saw in the theater in 97. These are actually the retooled \\"yet again\\" versions scene in 97 or as I say \\"super\\" special editions. Some of the changes are minor like the cleaning up of the digital effects used in the special editions \\"example jabba in ANH\\" to major boba fetts voice is now done by temuera morrison \\"aka jango fett in episode II\\". While some or a lot argue that this is not the version they wanted, I feel it adds to the overall completeness of the saga. And now on to the movies themselves...    Disc one, A New Hope - This is where the story begins of a young boy with dreams and a princess in danger coming together with everyones favorite duo Han and Chewie, to save the galaxy from the evil Darth Vader and empire. Probably the greatest thing to happen to movies, and George Lucas's masterpiece. Great effects, top notch story, and great baddies. 5 stars    Disc two, The Empire Strikes Back - Episode V picks up where ANH left off and delievers a knock out. Our heroes go to hoth to bespin and we meet yoda and learn the father/son connection. This has the deepest story of all and features more great effects and action scenes, \\"yes I'm talking bout the battle of hoth\\" gotta love them AT-AT walkers. 5 stars    Disc three, Return of the Jedi - Boy does the orginal trilogy go out with a bang, A death star sized bang! We get ewoks, space battles, the emperor, and even some romance, \\"ok so empire had more of that then ROTJ but its still in there. The series ends in great fashion and proves that good triumphs over evil in the end. 5 stars    Disc four, Bonus material - The final disc is filled full of good stuff. The most important edition is the empire of dreams documentary that is the biggest and best star wars documentary ever put together. You get the best look at all three movies behind the scenes and its just that good. Worth buying in its own right. Then you get lots of trailers and tv spots for all three movies along with a trailer for star wars battlefront. A game demo if you put it in your xbox and poster stills. Last of all you get a look at episode III which you'll watch even though you've seen the movie four times already! 5 stars    In the end this is one of the best box sets on the market right now. These are great films with great special features. Everyone should own this and if you don't well it ain't my fault if Lord Vader comes knocking at your door demanding why. 5 stars
0767834739|2.0|That's not really true. I didn't find this movie all that mind blowing. <br /> <br />Realistically, noone expects this movie to win any oscars. However, it is a little bit funner than most of Paul W.S. Anderson's other masterpieces. The thing is, you will be laughing at the action rather than be exhilarated by it. My favorite part in the movie is when they take a shortcut through a cemetary. It's priceless. <br /> <br />The only bad part about the movie, besides the script, acting, and plot, is the fact that our heroine is now super-human like. She just seems impossible to defeat as she can kill a million zombies with her kung fu abilities.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Well people. I have followed avenged sevenfold through all of their CDS. And this cd just slaps you in the face, and straight up EXPLAINS and depicts this bands musical intelligence. <br /> <br />Its amazing. This band can acctually change their sound, do something NEW, innovate music! CHANGE THINGS UP. Im so sick of hearing a band come out with a new cd, and its exactly the same as their previous stuff. <br /> <br />No one can take the musical responsibility to get better. Personally, i loved their previous albums, the screaming just got to me. They could make it so melodic. But when this album came out. I was BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER. Their guitarist has gotten twice as good. Implementing so many more amazing riffs. and the solos are so... amazing. At the end of sidewinder when he goes into this flamanco guitar solo, my jaw honestly hit the floor. I was so amazed. <br /> <br />I give this album an absolute 5 star. From hard core metal riffs, to flamanco guitar, to hallelua chorus to melodic acoustic ballads. I dont see what else you could want from a band.  <br /> <br />When a band can acctually innovate their music, that shows me they can produce something worth listening too. Now obviously he doesnt scream anymore. ( and by the way, he can still scream. I recently saw they in concert ) But yeah, even though he doesnt scream anymore. This album is amazing. <br /> <br />I sure hope he develops his voice a little, ( which is a slight downdfall ) and i hope they produce another 10 albums, and i hope they step it up, and become the modern metallica. Yes i said it. Metallica
B000002MFN|5.0|I've had this album ever since I was 13 years old. My mom knew I listened to it all the time, but she didn't give a crap. This album is one of Madonna's best works and listening to it years later reminds me when pop music actually used to be good. The lyrics aren't really that \\"explicit,\\" so I don't know what the parental advisory sticker is for. The music is a mixture of club and jazz and every song isn't about sex.(Rain, Why's It So Hard, In This Life). If you have any kind of imagination, then you can figure out what Madonna's referring to in most of her songs since she uses a lot of sexual metaphors. In today's music, you don't hear any of that. Artists today-Lil' Kim, Jacki-O, and Khia-  just come out with the raunchest lyrics, don't give a damn, and have the nerve to think they're sexy. No class or intelligence at all. I love every song and I recommend \\"Erotica\\" for all ages.
B0000648WZ|5.0|First off I'm reviewing the movie and the dvd. <br /> <br />Movie: Ok a lot of you write this movie off as just some cheap rehash of aliens and in a way it is. But the beauty is that it works. You are entertained throughout the movie from beginning to end. The plot is simple highschool teenagers all really like each other forming a love triangle and when one wants to go to war they all go. O yeah theres evil bugs set out to kill us all. So basically you got goofy love scenes and lots of killing. What more do you need to ask. 4 1/2 stars <br /> <br />DVD: This is one great dvd. Not only is the picture clear and the audio superb but then we get audio commentaries from the cast and crew. Then we have nice menus, lots of trailers and documentaries. Its just really good! 5 stars <br /> <br />Overall its a goofy teenage killing flick that takes a stab at our government (watch the movie you'll understand) with a great dvd, making a great experience.
B00005OAIE|5.0|what a gem of a cd this one would be. I had not heard of him until \\"Daughters.\\" A friend (who was my very own version of John's song \\"St. Patrick's Day\\") turned me on to his music by telling me about \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\" I caught John's performance on the PBS show \\"Austin City Limits.\\" I was blown away. I ordered \\"Room for Squares\\" then \\"Any Given Thursday.\\" I've been a fan ever since. All of the songs are so good. My #1 Fave is \\"St. Patrick's Day.\\" The first time I heard it I cried. You can just feel the emotion and passion he sings on it. Overall great cd. Make your own choice and get it for yourself. John's a keeper. I actually play this one more than \\"Heavier Things.\\"
B000088E6D|4.0|I, like another reviewer, was surprised to like so many of the songs on the CD.  Eleven out of thirteen?  That's well above average for me. <br /> <br />The intro to \\"Come Fly With Me\\" sounds EXACTLY like Sinatra's.  I don't know if the original intro was used or if they duplicated it.  It sounds great either way.  The only problem I have with that song is the way he pronounced \\"llama\\" like \\"lamb-a\\".  Is that a Canadian thing?  I guess I can live with that.   <br /> <br />How does a 25 year old end up singing THESE songs?  You'd expect an artist his age to be someone your TEENAGERS listen to.  I remember thinking to myself after hearing how young he sounds, \\"if this kid is anywhere close to 35, I'll EAT this CD\\", but twenty five???  I can't get over that. <br /> <br />The only songs I skip over are \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine'\\" (like Lou's version better) and \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\".  Both these songs seem too slowed down.   <br /> <br />I first heard his voice when he sang \\"For Once In My Life\\" at the end of \\"Down With Love\\".  It sounded really nice.  Yes, I realize he sang the title theme with some lady at the beginning of the movie too.  \\"Sway\\" makes me want to sign up for dance lessons!  I like how he added the Shakespearean lyrics to \\"Fever\\".  Very cute.  I'm glad the music stores have those headphone things where you can listen to snippets.  Helped me make a good decision.  <br /> <br />How's this kid gonna have any GROUPIES???  All his fans must be old enough to be his parents.  I just can't see him announced on Jay Leno's show and hearing teenagers screaming like they do for all the other twenty-something artists.  Heck, I'm 21 years his senior myself. <br /> <br />I STRONGLY recommend this CD!  But run it through the headphone thingie at the store if you don't believe me.  Good stuff.
B0007P3582|1.0|I can't stand this guy. I don't even understanding the words that come out of his mouth. All I hear is a bunch of mumbling and slurring. I mean, does he rap the way he talks or does he talk the way he raps? It doesn't matter because 50 cent still sucks anyway. So he's been shot a few times. Who cares? There are fools out there who actually go out and buy his so-called music. I've never heard this \\"Massacre\\" album before, but I can tell you for a fact that it's wack. Whenever I hear any of his music on the radio, I just change the station. I'll tell you what, anyone who likes and buys 50 Cents's music deserves what they get: nothing.
B0000027RL|5.0|August 27th, 1991 - Pearl Jam released the revolutionary 'Ten'  <br />September 24th, 1991 - Nirvana released the \\"revolutionary\\" 'Nevermind'  <br /> <br />Another one for the ages in the classic example of one album vs. another - It's an argument to go along beside 'London Calling' vs. 'Nevermind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols' - 'Pet Sounds' vs. 'Sgt. Peppers' - 'Led Zeppelin 4' vs. 'Dark Side of the Moon' etc.. etc..  <br /> <br />I have opinions regarding those albums that can be bent & changed depending on my mood - What cannot be changed is my opinion of 'Ten' vs. 'Nevermind' -  <br /> <br />The Seattle revolution was praised for changing the music scene from hair metal, to honest rock n roll again - Nirvana getting most of this praise since they got big first, & afterwards with Pearl Jam getting big months later - In modern times, unfourtantely, the hype & legend of this scene has covered many points in reality that the music at the time was so praised for - Nirvana was thought of as revolutionary, nothing like 'Nevermind' was released before... right?  <br /> <br />Wrong.  <br /> <br />- The Pixies. A band that combined the spirit of punk rock with basslines & drum beats wrapped around the guitars in a style not heard before.. the Pixies, while critically acclaimed, were not a well known band - Kurt Cobain, however, was one of their devoted listeners.. aswell as their biggest thief - He claimed that if it wasnt for 'Doolittle', Nevermind wouldve never been made... can't argue with the man there, he's right... 'Nevermind' is a blatant rip-off of 'Doolittle', aswell as 'Surfa Rosa'  <br /> <br />Nirvana basically took the exact same style of song writing & technique the Pixies invented, & made it mainstream... since the mainstream listening public is well known to be ignorant sheep, they hailed it as being \\"a revolutionary sound\\" - thereby annoying the christ out of all Pixies' lovers such as myself -  <br /> <br />So why did music critics acclaim 'Nevermind' then? - Guess what? THEY DIDNT - Rolling Stone magazine gave 'Nevermind' an average 3 stars for their effort ('Ten' got 4 stars)... it was only after the ignorant mainstream public loved 'Nevermind' to death, that it started becoming trendy to critically acclaim the album - It wasnt acclaimed from the beginning such as 'OK Computer' (whats that? it wasnt acclaimed because it was such a new sound? Bad argument. So was 'OK Computer' & it was acclaimed before it was released)  <br /> <br />Kurt was worshipped as being so \\"real\\"... guess what?  <br /> <br />You're wrong.  <br /> <br />the song 'Something in the Way' was reportedly written after Kurt was living under a bridge... Kurt NEVER lived under a bridge, sheep - He lied.. he was kicked out of his house when he was about to be intimate with a girl, & lived with friends for a while - Thats the true story, nothing dark, or sensitive.. just another case of the legend overshadowing the actual truth  <br /> <br />Here's some truth...  <br /> <br />the Pearl Jam song 'Release', written by Eddie Vedder, was a song he wrote about the death of his real father he never knew was his real father.. his mom never told him - This is a REAL song.. REAL emotion.. a TRUE story - not a legend, or a myth, just the truth.. also 'Alive' is based after the same story - Metaphorically believing his mom \\"raped\\" him  <br /> <br />Whereas Kurt seemed to keep things more self-centered in songs such as the simple-minded repetitive 'Lithium' & .. oh hell, every other song off Nevermind except 'Polly'... Eddie was writing songs reflecting the state of the world, in songs such as 'Jeremy', 'Even Flow', & 'Why Go?'  <br /> <br /> <br />Pearl Jam were original. No band sounded like Pearl Jam before Pearl Jam did - Sure.. Eddie had Jim Morrison type vocals, but thats as far of an influence you could hear through their music... anyone familiar with the Pixies, heard a blatant rip-off of the Pixies in Nirvana....  <br /> <br />Nirvana were not original. They were rip-offs. As much of rip-offs as Puddle of Mudd is to Nirvana, only Pixies were way less known - To further prove this fact, the amazon editorial review writes, 'Thousands of albums have tried to copy 'Nevermind's style\\" - Hey.. maybe they WERENT, maybe the bands thought of as trying to copy Neverminds style, were just also heavily influenced by the Pixies  <br /> <br />Please listen to the song 'Gouge Away' off Doolittle (pixies) - & in that song, you'll hear every song Nirvana ever wrote summed up into one song.  <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder wrote songs revolving around things that actually happened to him.. way more personal songs - & when he didnt, he wrote about songs for the state of the world -  <br /> <br />Kurt Cobain hardly wrote about songs he actually lived - In fact, their biggest hit, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was a song Kurt wrote about having friends....  <br /> <br />A[...] how sweet...  <br /> <br />Party music.  <br /> <br />Whereas Kurt insulted hair metal bands, he also cited hair metal leaders such as 'Van Halen' as huge influences...(anyone else notice that people who bought 'Nevermind' also bought 'Appetite for Destruction'?  <br /> <br />- In the end...  <br /> <br />Pearl Jam were always a more honest, & revolutionary sounding band than Nirvana... Kurts death overshadowed this, & he became a legend with fables told about him... theres no fables about Pearl Jam (except their name).. theyre just a true band.. & often times, non-fiction is much more amazing than fiction.. Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana is a case of this  <br /> <br />***** BUY THESE 2 GREATEST HITS ALBUMS ******  <br /> <br />1) Pearl Jam's 'Rearviewmirror'  <br />2) The Pixies' 'Wave of Mutilation'  <br /> <br />Kurt hated Pearl Jam's music? Well guess what Kurt - Black Francis of the Pixies, your biggest idol, hated YOUR music as I read in Blender magazine recently (& why not? it was just a watered down version of the music his band already made before)  <br /> <br />FACT: Kurt called MTV behind the scenes, & told them to play more Nirvana music videos  <br /> <br />FACT: Pearl Jam quit making MTV music videos  <br /> <br />& people think Nirvana was so rebelious? ha..  <br /> <br />In closing, I'd like to say anyone who connects with 'Nevermind' more than 'Ten' (even if is more popular) - & anyone who connects with \\"songs about friends\\" more than the epic Pearl Jam's 'Black' - Is about as rebelious & has as much emotional depth as a bottle cap.  <br /> <br />While Nirvana were writing songs for kids in high school to mosh in a gymnasium to, Pearl Jam were writing songs for the kids who were shooting themselves.  <br /> <br />...Even the name 'Nevermind' is just a rip-off of 'Nevermind the Bollocks'

B0007GAERG|5.0|This is in response to those who are writing negative reviews asking what has happened to the \\"real\\" Mariah. Where is the Mariah from the 90s? Well, to you all, if that is what you are waiting for, I suggest you never purchase another Mariah album as long as you live. You obviously have not done any research on Mariah at all! If you had, you would know that the Mariah from the 90s was definitely NOT the \\"real\\" Mariah, but rather a product of an over-controlled marriage and label pressure along with society adding to her own confusion. <br /> <br />\\"Mimi\\" is the name that Mariah's closest friends address her by. Her friends, the ones that know who she really is. She's spent the past few years really trying to find her place and the reason that this album is called, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is because she's finally found it! She's finally come to realize who she is and is happy with herself and ready to share it with the world. She doesn't feel the need to keep her real self private anymore and in my opinion, it truly shows!! Mariah's voice sounds much more relaxed, and it seems like she is having a wonderful time with this album. There is a sense of freedom in her music and this album is excellent from \\"It's Like That\\" to \\"Fly Like a Bird\\".  <br /> <br />I own EVERY album Mariah has ever put out, and I have to say that this is my favorite album of all! I say that because on every other album, there has been atleast ONE song that I wouldn't mind skipping through... but I love every last song on this album!! This is a fun, flirty, sexy, and relaxing album full of wonderful production by some of todays most talented (Kanye West, The Neptunes, JD). <br /> <br />Bottom line, it's really a matter of taste! If you're looking for the pop/contemporary Mariah... don't even bother cause she's gone for good! But if you love Mariah's voice and are a fan of R&B with a dash of Hip-Hop fun... this is DEFINITELY for you!! A MUST have!! <br /> <br />Good job Mimi!! =)
B00005YU1O|1.0|Ok, I give credit to the director for making a quite interesting movie.   <br /> <br />Lots of people here seem to love the movie, which is cool, but for me, I thought it was boring.  In fact, I didn't even finish watching the whole movie.  Lots of talk, talk, talk, and more talk. <br /> <br />Quite frankly, it never interested me. You like horror, action, mystery, drama..etc, then this movie shouldn't be for you.  <br /> <br />I thought it was going to be cool since its all animated, but besides that, its not that interesting.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Enough has been said about this incredible DVD. Altough is not my favorite group, this DVD has to be the most captivating DVD I have owned. Try to see the DVD alone, relaxed, specially the slow songs. You will feel connected, you will feel a rejoyce experience. There are not enough words to recommend this DVD.

B0009MDPYM|5.0|I don't understand why some people don't like this movie.  I keep an open mind, and I thought this movie was very cool. <br /> <br />Keanu as Constantine was pretty good, I think he acted better here than in the last 2 matrix movies. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, if you can keep an open mind, the plot makes sense and the special effects are very cool.
B0002F6BQU|4.0|This is a cute holiday film that is fun for the whole family. Will Ferrell is charmingly funny in the role of a human who is brought up by elves from the time that he was an infant. Through happenstance and fate, our very human elf,  named Buddy, after  the brand of diaper that he was wearing when he ends up in the North Pole, spends his days working in Santa's toyshop. Since he is over six feet tall and towers over the diminutive elves, Buddy sometimes feels a little bit out of place, especially as he is not much of a toy maker.<br /><br />When he accidentally discovers that he is not an elf at all, he is told the truth about his origins and discovers that his biological father is alive and well and living in New York City. So, he leaves his Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) and goes  off into the wild blue yonder to hook up with dear old dad (James Caan).  He makes quite a journey, only to discover that dear old dad is not really interested in welcoming a thirty-year-old son  of whose existence he was formerly unaware.  Of course, the fact that Buddy is dressed in a bright green elf outfit and sporting canary yellow tights does not help his cause.<br /><br />While Buddy felt a little out of place with the elves, his initial interactions with humans are totally off the wall and oftentimes quite amusing. With time, however, Buddy learns how to interact with humans. He finds brotherly love, true love, and familial love, as well. This does not happen, however, until he has undergone some personal angst. Buddy also discovers that he has a unique talent, one that will make him quite popular with a younger crowd.<br /><br />Will Ferrell approaches his role with a certain wide-eyed innocence and naivet&eacute;  that is endearing. He is also quite funny in this film.  Bob Newhart is, as always, deadpan funny. James Caan is excellent as the reluctant father. An unrecognizable Ed Asner is an effective Santa Claus. The film is well-directed by Jean Favreau, who has created a delightful film that should become a holiday favorite.film that should become a holiday favorite.
0790744295|4.0|CREEPSHOW is easily one of the best from horror legend George A. Romero. <br /> <br />This DVD is a weak presentation of this great movie, however.  The transfer is not terrible, but obviously no care was taken to create a new master for DVD encoding (it seems they used the old master used for VHS release).   <br /> <br />Also NOTE that both the widescreen and the full frame versions of CREEPSHOW are on this DVD.  The \\"widescreen\\" is actually just the full frame version with the top and bottom of the picture cut off.  You see MORE of the picture, not less, when you watch the full frame version on this DVD.   <br /> <br />This is a common problem for movies shot on a low budget.  Many were shot \\"square\\" and then cropped for theatrical release (on wide theater screens).  So, when the DVD gets released, instead of presenting the movie in it's original (square) aspect ratio, the DVD producers elect to crop the top and bottom of the movie, giving you a \\"widescreen version\\" that contains LESS picture information. <br /> <br />Other lower budget films suffer the same cropping:  Widescreen releases of THE EVIL DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and BRIDE OF REANIMATOR are all full frame films cropped at the top and bottom.  Usually, the full frame version is available on the same DVD... but, unfortunately, sometimes the cropped widescreen version is all you're given. <br /> <br />Back to CREEPSHOW... In addition to the weak transfer of the film, the DVD is virtually naked.  No bonus features. <br /> <br />Still, despite the disrespectful DVD presentation, CREEPSHOW is worth adding to your DVD collection because it is one of the best films to come from the 80's horror boom.  It is also one of those Romero films that had a decent budget but no studio interference. <br /> <br />A perfect mix of horror and humor make CREEPSHOW a winner.
0767812387|3.0|Overdone story line.  Bad acting on Kristofferen's part and even if Chayanne is a hearthrob in Cuba or Latin America...he can't act. <br />His Spanish dialogue made him more believable that his English. <br />Vanessa Williams whom I love fell flat. <br /> <br />Great dance sequences in the salsa club and at the end.  Otherwise the dance numbers were right out of Stictly Ballroom. <br /> <br />Story could have had more latin heat! ! !  As a latino myself, I wanted more heat and less of the tired old story line of boy meets girl.  This could have been a wonderful \\"learn how to dance like a latino in heat\\" story!  Not the bad love story it wanted to be. <br /> <br />Gave it 3 Stars for the DANCING...and 1 Star for the story and acting.
B00000JPH6|3.0|The story is like Lord of the Rings in the sense that we have all good vs all evil, and an object is carried by a halfling to straighten out the whole mess.<br /><br />In this case, the halfling is called a gelfling and it is the most human of the creatures in the story.  There are a pair of them, a boy and a girl, and they're cute.  Their faces are elongated to make them look just a bit like non-humans.<br /><br />The object is not a ring.  It is a small shard off of a huge magic crystal.  The gelfling must stick it back into the crystal to make the crystal whole, so that good will prevail in his world.<br /><br />The bad guys have control of the dark crystal and use it for evil purposes, to steal the life substance from helpless creatures in order to drink it themselves and become youthful.<br /><br />The race of good guys reminds me of a later movie, The Fifth Element.  The good guys are slow moving creatures, a bit brontosaurus like.  The bad guys are vulture-like, and a bit dinosaur-like as well.<br /><br />The strength of this film isn't in the plot.  It is in the physical characters and the world that is created.  Jim Henson's specialty is the creation of characters and a world to put them in.<br /><br />The plot itself is a simple save the world scenario, and you really wouldn't want to bet your mortgage on the bad guys winning, would you.<br /><br />So a review of the movie would be a review of the characters that have been created, and they are as good as you would expect from Henson.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of violence on screen.  This film is scarier than Sesame Street, but not overly so.  I don't think it would give most children nightmares.  It might give some sensitive children nightmares, because there is evil in it.<br /><br />There is an ambivalence in some of the characters.  You don't quite know whether to put them in the category of good or bad.  And the good and bad races blend together in the end, which of course doesn't happen in Lord of the Rings, or World War Two, which LOTR was written during.<br /><br />For pure story, Dark Crystal is a lightweight compared to LOTR.  It wasn't nearly as ambitious a project.happen in Lord of the Rings, or World War Two, which LOTR was written during. <br /> <br />For pure story, Dark Crystal is a lightweight compared to LOTR.

0790730960|5.0|<br />A good Batman movie. Actually a very good Batman movie. Michael Keaton does an excellent job in potraying the dark Batman that everybody likes to see not this comical Batman from the 60s TV show. Great storyline and cast. Danny DeVito did a great job acting as \\"The Penguin\\". He pulled it off very nicely. And Christopher Walken did a great job playing an scheming businseman. I kind of like Michael Gough as Alfred better then Caine in \\"Batman Begins\\". He's just great as Alfred and does a great job douing. Yes, I know Alfred was bald and had black hair in the comics but hey if he can pull it off, that's good enough. Michelle Pfeiffer also does a very good acting job in potraying a darker \\"Catwoman\\". That I've never really seen before on TV. Very good movie.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I first discovered Sarah Brightman when PBS was showing her One night in Eden concert and I was hooked from then on. Eden is one fantastic song after the other and I have so many favorites. But the songs that I listen to the most are: In Paradisum, Eden, Anytime, Anywhere, Dust in the wind, Il mio coure va, Deliver me, Tu, Only an ocean away, and The Last words you said. But the most powerful song on the cd is Nessun Dorma, which I have grown to love over the years. If you have never bought a Sarah Brightman cd before, I suggest buying this one first because you get both opera and her more pop songs. And if you're a fan but don't have Eden in your collection yet, you must get it and you won't regret it.
0920236162|5.0|As an early childhood educator, I strongly recommend this story to all families, particularly those with little girls that like princesses. This book sends a message which contradicts the images of passivity portrayed by Disney princesses and the like. It is a fabulous baby shower gift, particularly for those expecting a baby girl. It goes very well with \\"Princess Smarty Pants\\" as well as \\"Father Gander\\".
0061015725|3.0|Prey is your typical Michael Crichton fast paced science thriller. However you feel about Crichton's past novels, you will feel exactly the same about this one. Like most other Crichton yarns, the book covers a time period of only a few days, during which the fate of the world hangs in the balance due to some technological catastrophe caused by overly ambitious scientists. Also like his previous books, Crichton will educate you on a particular branch of state of the art science. Where previous novels covered fields such as paleontology, time travel, aeronautics, and virtual reality, Prey deals with the menacing new threat of nanotechnology. For me, this is the only reason I keep picking up every new Crichton book that comes down the pike. I enjoy learning about the latest cutting edge technology within the backdrop of a \\"worst case scenario\\" action story. Otherwise, I usually stay away from these sort of fluffy, beach book, dime a dozen thrillers.

0689878451|5.0|What a great story! Not only is it cute that the two male penguins get to raise a family, but it's just like how penguins are. Males take care of the eggs just like females in the wild, so it makes sense that two males could hatch an egg & care for a chick. Inspiring!
B0006L16N8|2.0|The comparisons some make between Coldplay and U2 are unwarranted. Six years into U2's career, Bono & Co. had already made four LPs with lasting songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day and Pride (In The Name of Love). Whereas these songs have an immediate and unambiguous message, the only message I can derive from Coldplay is that the world is messed up but let's make the best of it. <br /> <br />The music on X&Y tries too hard to be anthemic, stadium filler. I guess they figured now that they're big, they have to write \\"the big song\\". Despite this, these songs still sound like easy listening muzak. There is hardly a trace of the charm Coldplay used to have.  <br /> <br />If you want easy listening, buy some Gordon Lightfoot or Celine Dion. <br /> <br />[DW]
B0002SROT0|5.0|\\"From a Basement on the Hill\\", the select cuts off of Elliott Smith's would-be double album(that is, of course, had he not stabbed himself in the heart two times), is just as good, if not better, than everything else in his catalog. Whereas \\"Either/Or\\", \\"XO\\", and \\"Figure 8\\" all had distinct musical styles (lo-fi, orchestral, and Beatle-esque, epic production respectivley), \\"Basement\\" has a more ecclectic feeling, containing all his previous styles of music (plus new ones) in one album, and on occassion even one song. (That new style being, apparently, quite loud- \\"Coast to Coast\\", \\"Don't Go Down\\", \\"King's Crossing\\" and \\"A Distorted Reality is now a Necessity to be Free\\" are all examples of loud, heartfelt songs, more \\"Rock\\" than \\"Indie-Rock\\", different from anything Elliott had made thus far) <br />         As for the claims that this album would have been the next \\"White Album\\". To be honest, I personally have never heard \\"The White Album\\". But if it can top \\"Basement\\", then I'd be glad to give it a listen. Every song on \\"Basement\\" is good. Highlights include: \\"King's Crossing\\", the most poetic song, as well as possibly the loudest song, on the disc, \\"Twilight\\", another beautiful 'ballad', a combination of Smith styles old and new, \\"A Fond Farewll\\", another melancholic, immersive 'ballad', and \\"Let's Get Lost\\", a reminder of the simple  beauty of Either/Or. To paraphrase many other reviewers sentiments, it's just a shame this is his last one. <br />
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A has to be one of my favorite albums of all genres. I never listened to Radiohead until I heard one of my sweatmates listening to one of the songs on this album. After I bought it and listened to it, the album instantly became one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this album is the best Radiohead has produced and I strongly recomend it to anyone. In true Radiohead style the album comes packed their own style of music, composing a (nearly) complete album of hit tracks. The only song that I believe doesnt hold its own is the last song, 'Motion Picture Soundtrack', but besides that every other song is great. Well worth every penny.
B00005AXEL|5.0|With \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" Stevie Nicks proves that she not only is a legend of past rock and roll, but that she still holds her title as its queen.  <br /> <br />Released in 2001, Nicks' idea for the album came from a 1995 dinner conversation with friend Tom Petty at the Ritz Carlton-Phoenix. Nicks asked Petty over dinner to help her write a few new songs to gain her courage back and he refused, telling her that she could write her own songs as she was one of the greatest songwriters he'd ever known. She went home that night and wrote \\"That made me stronger\\", an ode to Tom's praise. <br /> <br />Shortly thereafter, Nicks was inspired by the events surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial. The fact that he was \\"so beloved and had everything and just threw paradise out the window as so many other celebrities have\\" amazed Nicks, so she wrote \\"Trouble In Shangri La\\", the title track to what was to become a very strong album in songwriting and instrumentation, not to mention vocally - it features Nicks in her truly finest form since 1981's #1 hit album \\"Bella Donna\\". <br /> <br />Pulling from her library of songs are those written during her early Fleetwood Mac and Buckingham/Nicks days: \\"Sorcerer\\" (written about arriving in early 1970's LA with Lindsey seeking stardom) and \\"Planets Of The Universe\\" (written about her break-up with Buckingham - a hit that never made it to FM's \\"Rumours\\" as intended and closely resembles \\"Rhiannon\\").  <br /> <br />Nicks welcomes several guest artists to the project: Sheryl Crowe (who wrote \\"It's Only Love\\" for Nicks & co-produced the album), Macy Gray (on \\"Bombay Sapphires\\", Nicks' favorite song from the album), The Dixie Chicks (on the Country inspired \\"Too Far from Texas\\") and Sarah McLaughlin (who provides vocals and piano on \\"Love Is\\"). The album's only duet is with The Dixie Chicks, the other artists contribute as background vocalists/musicians. <br /> <br />The album produced the hits \\"Everyday\\" (not written by Nicks) and \\"Sorcerer\\", although every song is so incredibly strong - Nicks even allows us to hear her falsetto voice (not heard since the 70's at least) and her abilities as a musician on keyboards and percussion.  <br /> <br />Although Nicks deserves tremendous credit for her work, it is fueled by an incredible group of engineers, producers and musicians who bring her into the millenium while still providing a Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac sound. The music is truly incredible, driven by new studio musicians and a few familar faces: her longtime background vocalists Sharon Celani & Lori Perry Nicks, as well as rock's reknowned guitarist Waddy Wachtel (who played on Nicks' first 5 solo albums). <br /> <br />The 2001 Tour was a great success for Nicks and because of the albums profound success, it recieved much praise in the national media on VH1, MTV, Entertainment Tonight, The Today Show, Rosie O'Donnell and The Late Show, as well as newspapers and popular magazines.  <br /> <br />Stevie proved in 1981 that a member of a legendary band could strike out on their own as a successful solo artist. In 2001, Stevie proved that a legend could still make hit records that live up today's music business' standards with \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\". Its a must for any Stevie/Fleetwood Mac fan, one that will be listened to over and over again...
1400032717|1.0|I suppose that I will disagree with everyone else who rated the is book, but I could barely get through the book.  I supposed if you're a math nut you would thoroughly enjoy this book, but math is one of the reasons why I thought it totally boring.  About half way through the book I almost tossed the book in the trash.  I only finished it because I have a policy of finishing what I start.  I never appreciate that kind of language in a book especially when it's about a 15 year old boy, I supposed that's supposed to be realism, but all it does is put a stamp of approval to the teenage reader.  I found that the further I read I hoped that somebody would do in the boy with the absolutely irritating manner.  In my opinion, the boy belonged in a special school for problem children.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
0060254920|5.0|Although I have read many books, only a few stand out in my mind over the years. \\"Where the Wild things are\\" is one of the few books which has always been one of my favorites. If you missed out on this book in your childhood, than perhaps you should spend the few dollars to experience this pleasent romp in the imagination of a child. If you have children then you should almost assuradly get ahold of a copy of this book and let them loose in a land where the monsters are real and friendly and dancec with you; a land where getting sent to thier room doesnt have to mean that they have to be bored and sullen; nay, they will see that they have access to whole worlds full of endless possibilities with which to play. that only thier imagination limits them. <br /> <br />But don't take my word for it, for I am biased by my love of this story during my childhood; see for youself.
B000002LQD|5.0|Magic and Loss was another concept album from Lou Reed.  I wished he made more of them because he's quite good and making song cycle discs.  The story of this album is about the cycle of life and death,  magic and loss of life and how they intwine with each other.  Lou Reed lost to friends to cancer and his thoughts and expressions were put to music.  A lot of interesting ideas here (how radiation can cause cancer but it's used to treat it at the same time)<br /><br />that are executed very well.<br /><br />A depressing album that has a small light at the end of the tunnel.  Just like life, in order for it to continue we have to accept loss along with the magic.  One hand washing the other.  Great stuff from Lou Reed. Check out New York,  Songs for Drella, Berlin and Blue Mask for other great concept albums from the New Yorck City Man himself, Lou Reed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005NB8K|2.0|Wow, I really have no idea how people can give this movie good reviews. <br /> <br />The camera work is interesting, and it definitely captured the times and gave me a good sense of who Jim Morrison was (well, at least as Oliver Stone saw him), but it's not really much of a movie. <br /> <br />Jim Morrison was born, he became famous, and then he died.  All of the rest of the stuff just happens for no reason, like in real life.  I have no problem with a movie being like that, but what pissed me off was Stone's usual pretentiousness in trying to make this movie \\"meaningful\\".  This movie is just about some guy's life; there's really no meaning to it.  Instead of admitting that, he sticks in indians and other weird shots as if that will make the movie deeper somehow.  It doesn't, it just looks stupid, and it tells the viewer nothing of The Doors or Jim Morrison. <br /> <br />The movie was also kind of boring.  Scenes went on for way too long, and everything blended together into an incohesive mush so that whatever happened seemed unremarkable and pointless (which it was, most of the time).  I have no problem with pointless stuff, when it really adds to the characters (as in a Woody Allen movie), but here it just seemed to continue to hammer into the viewer's head the same portrait of Jim Morrison that was crystal clear around twenty minutes into the movie.  The character didn't unfold at all; it just gutted itself near the beginning and then pointed to different squishy bits for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br />So thanks a lot, Oliver Stone, for ruining what could have been an interesting movie. <br /> <br />The only reason I give it two stars is for the part with Andy Warhol, when he mentions that he could call God on his telephone, but he has nothing to say to him, so he gives the telephone to Jim Morrison and says \\"Now you can talk to God.\\"   <br /> <br />How could you not love that part?
B0001WTVUW|4.0|The Day After (1983) has finally made it's way onto D.V.D. (even though it was released in South America two years before in an alternate superior cut).  M.G.M. dropped the ball with their full-screen presentation and no extras to speak of.  I would have gladly paid an extra five dollars to have some trailers, deleted scenes, widescreen transfer (N.Meyer shot this in 1.78.1 believe it or not) a commentary track and a featurette of some kind.<br /><br />One day, Soviet-U.S. relations take a big dip  Soviet aggression towards West Germany has reached a zenith.<br /><br />N.A.T.O, forces and those under the Warsaw Pact are nearing an armed conflict.  Meanwhile in the States, the people are in a malaise.  Many of them don't care about foriegn affairs.  The movie focuses on severa; families that live in the Kansas//Missouri area.  The Oakes, Hendrys, Dahlbergs and the McCoys.  They all have the same family issues that everyone sems to have.  That is until the DAY AFTER the bomb drops. Who will survive and what will become of them?<br /><br />The DVD picture is servicable, considering the movie is over twenty years old.  The soundtrack has several flaws in it,<br /><br />some scenes have an aweful echo effect and reverb that wasn't apperant on the South American release.  I just wished a film like this would have received better treatment.<br /><br />Too bad Anchor Bay did get the D.V.D. rights to this one. They would have done it justice.<br /><br />Recommended for historical significene
B00005RHGL|5.0|Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are the driving force that makes this film work. Sure it isn't totally realistic, but it is more fun than any other western I have seen. The gunfight at the OK Corral in the film is probably the best you will ever see at showing what most likely really happened on October 26, 1881. Val Kilmer steals every scene he is in and spews forth some of the coolest lines you will ever here coming out of a western movie. Kilmer's Doc Holliday is one of the only roles I can stand him in and he is an absolute genius at this part. I'm not a huge fan of Kurt Russell either, but he is my favorite Wyatt Earp by far. This is a must have western that is more fun than Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp, but I would see that one too for a more accurate depiction of Earp's life.

B00005JNEI|1.0|If you are judging this on cinemagraphic sophistication, directing, or the ability for a director to put out his personal message, then this would be a five star film.  If however you're looking for intellectual honesty and integrity of the facts a supposed documentary uses to prove its point, then this a one star, and barely even that.  This flick is horribly biased and distorted to the point of outright lying, as Moore is a master of redirection ans taking things out of context to get us to believe what he wants us to believe.   <br /> <br />-He shows the secret service guarding the Saudi Embassy and asks rhetorically why.  If he checked his sources (and it would be quite bizarre if he didn't) he would have known the Secret Service's bylaws say they can provide extra security to embassies when asked (and not just for the Saudis), but instead Moore implies there \\"may be\\" some financial favoritism between them and Bush. <br /> <br />-He shows a video of a meeting between the Taliban and gov't officials, and Moore asked rhetorically why this is so.  If he checked his sources (which happens to be his own video) he would have known that it was to demand they turn Bin Laden over, but instead Moore implies there \\"may be\\" some financial favoritism between them and Bush. <br /> <br />-He reports that \\"while Bush was governor of texas the Taliban visited his state for a meeting with oil executives over building oil pipes in their country\\".  Moore has to know that Bush had nothing to do with this meeting (it was actually with Clinton officials) so the only reason Moore would care to even mention Bush is to falsely imply that he did...without actually coming out and saying he did. <br /> <br />You get the picture.  Moore deliberately takes innoculous facts and makes them look like something they're not, and then asks a supposedly rhetorical question so he can supply his own intended answer which he repeats until you start believing it- Bush putting financial deals over the welfare of the country.   <br /> <br />When the facts he quotes aren't incriminating enough, he spices them up.  He can then honestly say that everything he says is true because he really doesn't say anything.  He portrays what he wants you to think on your own.  With this kind of deliberate misdirection, one can even make mother Theresa look like a Nazi war criminal. <br /> <br />Like Bush or hate Bush, it really doesn't matter.  If you're going to criticize him then criticize him over legitimate issues, like the war in Iraq.  Don't be engineering false material because it's literally fostering false public unrest for your own political and/or financial gain.  Propaganda is propaganda, regardless of who it's coming from, or so they tell me. <br /> <br />
B000066744|3.0|This offering from director Giuseppe Tornatore was billed as \\"an epic story of a man who could do anything... except be ordinary.\\"  Tim Roth stars as the title character - the spastic, moody pianist who was born and raised on a ship, and named after the year in which he was found.  He encounters many unique personages on his travels, most notably the story's narrator, Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince).  The two become fast friends: 1900 teaches Max to find his sea-legs, and Max becomes his most devoted fan.  For 1900 is a piano prodigy.  He plays beautiful music that no one has ever heard before, inspired by the faces of passengers that he sees.  Appropriately, his most gorgeous piece is written when he catches sight of the woman he is destined to love.  There's only one problem: he refuses to set foot on dry land. <br /> <br />The film is, basically, a fantasy.  A grown-up's fairy tale.  Not for a moment do I believe that any of this could ever happen, and neither did all the critics who gave it negative reviews.  This kind of movie is acceptable, perhaps, in Europe.  Not in America.  Our critics demand realism, and their usual beef with any given film is the \\"unrealistic\\" happenings, or \\"plot holes\\".  But it's The Legend of 1900 for a reason...it isn't real, and we're not meant to believe that it is.  In order for this type of story to work, the characters must be compelling enough to carry a fantastical tale.  Films like Goldfinger and Ocean's 11 have banked on this before, and we've become used to such hijinks in the action/adventure genre.  But an unbelievable drama? <br /> <br />There's no question that Roth's 1900 is fascinating.  Charmingly neurotic, he endures the ribbing of his friends and enemies with Bogartesque grace.  The character of Max Tooney is meant to be the duller companion to his genius: the Watson to his Holmes, the Robin to his Batman.  Unfortunately Vince's performance leaves something to be desired, and his character is given little to do.He plays the trumpet well and (reportedly) tells a great story, but he lacks the charisma needed in a sidekick.  When 1900's home ship, The Virginian, is destined to be destroyed, Max embarks on a quest to find 1900 and save him from the explosion.  This search spans the whole film, intercut with flashbacks to the many voyages of Max and 1900.  The ending is predictable.  In fact, each moment in the film is predictable, with one exception.  Almost every single plot point is shamelessly foreshadowed at least once, and I found myself wondering wearily how long it would take to reveal each \\"twist\\".  Maybe it's the American in me.  I just wanted to see stuff get blown up. <br /> <br />The one truly interesting scene is the \\"piano duel\\" between 1900 and jazz sensation Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III).  You find yourself as bewildered by 1900's behavior as are the passengers...what is he doing?  Why?  When will he finally show Jelly Roll who's boss?  In spite of yourself, you really want this strange young sea-bound man to win.  You like him.  What's not to like? <br /> <br />But liking a character isn't always enough to carry a film.  Such is the case here.  In the end, you realize that you never really had any vested interest in 1900 or his fate.  He's interesting to look at, but his magic lasts only as long as his fingers play. <br /> <br />Rating out of 5:  * * 1/2
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|This entry into the Universal \\"Gold\\" series is an excellent one, all of Donna's major hits are here, some 12\\" versions but mainly the original album length and 7\\" cuts.  The songs are presented chronologically and leaves no space on either disc which makes this collection cheap for the price. Donna was the supreme dance floor Queen and I'd like to see a set of her choice 12\\" mixes compiled. Donna recorded songs for her two previous \\"Greatest Hits\\" packages released in the last decade and those cuts are here as well, making the two prior releases obsolete and to further keep this comp fresh, her studio side \\"I Will Go With You\\" from the VH1 soundtrack \\"Live and More\\" recorded for Sony is here also. All \\"Hits\\" compilations from any artist releasing such a set should be as comprehensive as this one.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I first heard Josh Groban on his album JOSH GROBAN, and decided, hey, I should check this other one out. CLOSER is incredible! His voice is incredible. Josh Groban can SING. Holayyy. And it isn't even just the strength of his voice; it's his range, and his tone. He's probably the best tenor of recent years.
B000002LQD|4.0|Magic and Loss grabbed me in the 90's when I was relatively at peace with myself. It grabbed me again this year when I had experienced some turmoil and loss. Forgetting the \\"depressing\\" lyrics for a moment, it's got some catchy licks and a couple of excellent tunes (well, Lou doesn't actually sing, but whatever you call what he does is very effective here). <br /> <br />Do people really avoid depression by not thinking about something? I don't know, but I come out of listening to this album feeling better about life. Not because he holds out any false hope or turns to Greener Pastures at the end, but because hey, if this guy can deal with his grief and turn it into art, then by golly so can I.
B00005K9LK|5.0|OK..True story..I was 12 when this \\"Album\\" came out. I didn't know too much about metal at the time, nor much about Priest. However, these very songs opened up my eyes to a new genre of music, paving the way for my musical tastes through the following decade. <br /> My air guitar playing skills were defined by the likes of THE HELLION/ELECTRIC EYE. Try not to do it. Try not to listen to this song very loud, without throwing your hands up as if cradling a kick ass guitar. I still do it to this day. I am the greatest air guitarist I know. <br /> My favorites on this CD, are hands down, every single last one of them. Each song is filled with GLENN/K.K's duel guitar works, and ROB's dinstinctive wail. Each song has it's own flavor to it. The songwriting is as good as metal could be, but ROB brings every word to life.  <br /> You will not waste your money. If you are into PRIEST, get this one, BRITISH STEEL, DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH, for the 80's era gems. For earlier recordings, refer to SIN AFTER SIN, SAD WINGS OF DESTINY.  <br />
B00005YXZH|3.0|Actually, it's neither. Wilco has long outgrown the alt-country label, and the little spriggets (don't Googol that, it's a made-up word) of radio static and cool electronic stuff don't make for a concept. A lot of people think Heavy Metal Drummer is the best thing on the disk, and they're not just being mainstream. It's catchy and doesn't pretend to more than it is. But, despite 3 or 4 good songs (Reservations, Pot Kettle Black), what I take away from this CD is that British lady repeating those \\"enigmatic\\" call letters for about 15 minutes.  And I don't see how that makes for a concept album, or a classic.  The songs are better on \\"A Ghost Is Born,\\" so pick that one up instead.
B0007P3582|3.0|Forget about the posturing, this is about pop music.  It doesn't matter how you feel about rap and its negative image, this is about catchy music that can get maximumm spins on the radio.  50 is one of the smartest rappers out there; he understands that the key to getting your songs played on the radio and maintaining strong record sales is to write catchy, hook-heavy rap songs.  No matter how much you may hate him or love him, you cannot deny his flow.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|AGAIN, Pat and friends pull off another mind blower which just leaves you speechless. Once you sit down and star playing Pat Metheny, that's it. You can't go back to playing any other jazz for the night and I tell you this from experience. DON'T ASK, JUST GET IT. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.
B000060P79|1.0|Oh great, yet another band jumping on the \\"We Sound Like Blink 182\\" bandwagon [and by no means am I defending Blink 182, because they also suck.]. These guys have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The songs are generic, the guitar playing is atrocious, and the singer can neither sing nor write lyrics. No Pads, No Helmets...No Talent.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I received the DVD in 2 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Kim explained the condition of the product perfectly.  Thanks!
B000089RVX|1.0|I liked them better before the singer had undergone the sex change operation and the name of the band was \\"Linkin Park\\". Oh, wait...no I didn't. Don't buy this, it's not worth it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|When I first played The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, I was greeted with an impossibly theatrical opener entitled \\"Five Years.\\" As it grew ever larger and more dramatic, that song sucked me into a different world - a world that was both decaying and decadent, as well as coming apart at the seams. From there, Bowie leads the listener through a series of songs that outline the events that unfold in the future, when an androgynous, bisexual rock star (who, incidentally, also happens to be an alien) becomes a kind of messiah for the people of the dying Earth. Grandiose? Oh yeah. And Bowie milks the concept for every ounce of drama and energy he could take. It's also a very eclectic album, ranging from straight-ahead rock and roll (\\"Hang On To Yourself,\\" the excellent \\"Suffragette City\\"), dramatic ballads (\\"Lady Stardust,\\" \\"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide), and slower, hard-edged songs (\\"It Ain't Easy,\\" \\"Ziggy Stardust\\"). The album reads more like a great soundtrack than a full-fledged opera - as a concept album, it's rather loose, so it's easier imagining The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars as a collection of songs from a musical. Still, it's some of the best glam-rock ever conceived, theatrical and powerful, but at the same time catchy and riff-laden.    The high point of the album is undoubtedly \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" itself. A better portrait of the collapsing rock star I've yet to encounter, as Bowie sings \\"He took it all too far/but boy could he play guitar\\" and \\"Making love with his ego/Ziggy sucked up into his mind/Like a leper messiah/When the kids had killed the man/I had to break up the band.\\" It's the best song on the album, and perhaps the best song Bowie ever created.    In my opinion, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is the finest album in Bowie's catalog, encapsulating everything that was great about his glam years. Buy this album, and believe me, you will not be disappointed.
B000002N2P|5.0|Every Green Day poser will tell you that Green Day's major label debut, \\"Dookie\\", is their best album, but they obviously never took the time to listen to \\"Insomniac\\". I mean, REALLY listen to it. This is their most \\"punk rock\\" album, in that it's their most aggressive album. The guitar and drum sounds are enormous, especially on songs like \\"Geek Stink Breath\\", \\"Brain Stew\\", and \\"Panic Song\\". However, even with the added aggression, Green Day still hold on to their catchy choruses and melodic sensibilities. This album was my first introduction to Green Day, and if you're just getting into them, I reccommend that it be yours as well.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I did not see it coming. This movie is SO good. And it was not an esay undertaking. Theproducers really made theirbest with the puppets.<br /><br />This movie is plain fun. A lot of jokes are good. Of course, coming from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, there are the usual flatulence jokes, vomit jokes, sex jokes. But they are much more restrained and well placed than the South Park feature lenght movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack is clever, simple and right to the point. In truthe (as you can see in teh special features) this is a joke about Jerry Bruckenheimer movies. I enjoyed the whole movie, no weak spots here.
B0000029DD|5.0|I found about Jeff Buckley when I read interviews with countless artists who cited his music as an influence. After listening to his debut CD, \\"Grace\\" [and the only one he released before his tragic death in 1997], I can see why. This guy has a voice that will leave you hanging on every word. His cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" gives me chills [in a good way], and \\"Last Goodbye\\" gets better every time I listen to it. The best way to experience this album is at night with all the lights off; trust me, it really works! Simply put, Jeff Buckley was an angel who left us before he could really show the world what he was capable of.
B00009N83Y|3.0|\\"City Heat\\" (1984) is a nostalgic throwback to those Spencer Tracy-Clark Gable vehicles of the late 1930s. It's lightweight stuff, but Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds make a good team in this Prohibition-era caper. The star chemistry compensates for a weak script and troubled production history (Clint selected director Richard Benjamin after a falling out with original collaborator Blake Edwards - alias Sam O. Brown in the final credits). Though a disappointment with critics and audiences, Clint and Burt have done much worse.
B00004TH6O|5.0|I first heard this album in 7th grade, and as far as I'm concerned, it stands the test of time. Since then, there's been a lot of Dave Grohl hype [which is fine; \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" is incredible], but with or without Dave Grohl, QOTSA make real rock music, with no tricks or gimmicks. I love all their albums, but this is the one that I hold in the highest regard. Favorite tracks: \\"In The Fade\\" and \\"The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret\\".
B000002U9W|5.0|First notice that almost anybody who gave this album 1 star had a child's review and couldn't spell better than my grandma can play basketball. This says something about the maturity level of this album, and indeed, if you get around the thoughts of \\"when will this song end?\\" you will enjoy it more. Who cares when it ends? Divide it into multiple songs if it helps, but close your eyes and let the music take you away instead of counting down the seconds. Trust me, you'll enjoy it more. Anyways, on to critiquing the songs individually. <br /> <br />Atom Heart Mother...(title goes on) -at nearly 24 minutes with not a single unneeded second, you can't go wrong with this track. Echoes is still better, but hey, that doesn't mean this track isn't near perfect. 10/10 <br /> <br />If-Personally, this is my least favorite track on the album not because it's bad, but I expect way more from Roger Waters. Still a good song all in all. 8/10 <br /> <br />Summer 68'-I can't say much about this track. Nothing you wouldn't expect from floyd. 9/10 <br /> <br />Fat Old Sun-Very nice song, very nice lyrics. I was impressed by Wright's work. 10/10 <br /> <br />Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast-Haha, this is why I love floyd. Who else could make a 13 minute song about eating breakfast, and <br />still make it interesting. Great piano to accompany it. 9/10 <br /> <br />So as you can see, this album earns a 92%, putting it at the top 5 albums of floyd, along with the wall, wish you were here, animals, and dark side.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead started out as your average British Alternative band. Then came \\"OK Computer\\"; no one had heard anything like it before, and no one ever will. With this album, they carved their own niche in the world of music and inspired a ton of bands in the process. There's nothing on earth like the combination of Thom Yorke's voice and Jonny Greenwood's innovative style of guitar playing. \\"Paranoid Android\\" is well worth the price of the CD.
B00006DEFA|3.0|Now, I'm not a Mozart fan, and I hardly know anything about him, but I DO know that his music is marvelous, and I DO know that this is a very good movie.  Normally I'd tell you that Director's Cuts are much better then Original Releases, but this isn't the case here. <br /> <br />The extra footage is very good and all, but there is one thing.  And the way I discovered it is one that is hilarious now, but wasn't very funny and still gives me nightmares.  Constanze Mozart goes to visit Salieri to ask him if he can give Wolfgong a job.  Salieri is, of course, amazed as always by Wolfgong's musical skills.  And, he tells her that there's a way he can get Wolfgong a job, because they were very poor, but she has to come to his house alone.  Of course, he wasn't really ever going to give Mozart the job, and he thought she'd not come.  She did.  And after a chat (she was trying to avoid the worst), there's a nude scene.  This one thing and one thing only spoiled everything for me.  And, I wouldn't be writting this normally, but I think it's fair to warn you, that the original release is definitely the way to go.  What surprises me is, we didn't see the rating.  Usually our mom checks this stuff out before she watches something new, but she'd seen and loved the original and thought this would have nothing wrong, so she just popped it in.  Our DVD player has a power button on the remote, but it doesn't work, so we couldn't get it to turn off.  The way everyone rushed around and panicked because of this is funnyn now, but definitely wasn't funny then. <br /> <br />The Original Release VS. the Director's Cut.   Hmm.  Yep, I'd say Original, unless you can ignore this one flaw and go on, but I sure didn't. <br /> <br />Keep in mind, I haven't seen all of this movie or the Original, I'm just here posting a warning, get the Original.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|This is by far the best Foo Fighters album. \\"Everlong\\" and \\"My Hero\\" are two of the best rock songs I've ever heard in my life. People who don't like this album probably don't like rock music very much because this album contains all the ingredients of a proper rock record.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy is a movie worth watching. Eric Bana does a great job on playing Hector, Prince of Troy. Hector is showed as a kind and decent man that loves his family and country. And with his performance, you will believe it. Peter O'Toole was a natural choice for playing Priam, King of Troy. The movie is centered around Achilles, Brad pits character. And he plays him well for the way the movie is written. He is shown as a self-centered man that fights for his own reasons, and does not care for the fate of Greace or their kings. What is important to Achilles, is that his name go down in history as great. <br /> <br />Pitt obviously did a lot of work to get in shape and learn the great choreography of the fights. Achilles fight scene with Hector is the real star of this movie. It is a very exciting fight, starting with his moving stride across the sand as he starts the attack. Pitt does makes us feel that Achillies is the greatest warrior on that battlefield. <br /> <br />Priam had negotiated a peace between Troy and Sparta's King Menelaus, played by Brendan Gleeson. But this peace is broken when Paris, played by Orlando Bloom, convinces Helen, played by Diane Kruger, to run away with him to Troy. The movie shows that Priam and Hector know that what Paris did was wrong, and yet they will risk the safety of Troy to keep Helen. <br /> <br />Seeing the large Greek army array itself before Troy is impressive. And the large battle scenes are exciting. Espcially when they try to show some of the manuevers in close ups. The rest seems to just be computer animation for the large scenes. Extras must cost too mch no a days. But still fun to watch. <br /> <br />The film is not true to the epic poem. But then, what movie is true to the written medium. You can not show all the true dynamics of the poem. After all the war lasted ten years. And the fact tha tthe real reason for the Greek alliance was not political as the movie shows, but it was rather a part of an oath sworn by all the princes who were suitors for Helen. And the film does take liberty not only with when certin people died during the war, like Achilles himself, but as to who even actually died. Forgetting all that, I loved this move for entertainment, but not as a history lesson.
1582403589|4.0|In a 4-page introduction to his comic, writer/creator Robert Kirkman professes his love for zombie movies and tells us that he especially likes those that have a human side to them, thrown in with doses of social commentary (a la Dawn of the Dead).  He said that in light of this, he wanted not so much to focus on violence and gore but on the human dynamics of people trapped in a zombiefied world, how they survive, how they stay sane, how they choose to live.  While reading this intro I got a little worried that Kirkman would write an overtly emotional tale.  Let&#8217;s face it, we all want gut-munching and gore in our zombie tales don&#8217;t we?  Not to fear, while the human/emotional side is ambivalent, Kirkman and illustrator Tony Moore throw in enough of the red stuff to satisfy the most hardcore horror fan.  In fact, The Walking Dead strikes just the right balance between horror and human emotions that I&#8217;ve seen in an undead tale since, well, Dawn of the Dead.<br /><br />Rick Grimes is a celebrated police officer with a loving wife and son who lives a pretty normal life.  Then one day he gets shot in the chest while in the line of duty and lands in a hospital.  When he wakes up from his coma roughly a month later, he discovers that the world around him has changed in a dramatic way: the streets are empty and desolate, with trash and debris scattered all over the place.  There are no humans in the streets.  There are, however plenty of flesh-eating ghouls, zombies, whatever you want to call them.  Rick goes back to his house and finds his family missing.  When he gets word from a neighbor that they might be in Atlanta, he hits the road from Kentucky to Atlanta.  What he sees on his way there are horrors beyond belief&#8230;<br /><br />While I found the dialogue at times to be awkward and stilted (this is a comic book after all), Kirkman&#8217;s real strength as a writer is his imagination, especially in the variety of obstacles that he has his characters face.  As for the characters, he does a great job of fleshing them out, especially the camp survivors, he introduces us to about ten new characters at once.  It&#8217;s a lot to absorb at first but he develops them well and we warm up to them quickly.  This first volume is a great introduction to the series and covered a whole lot of ground.  We get the hero waking up and being thrust into a lost world, the hero travelling the highways and discovering myriad horrors on it, the hero arriving into the city and discovering even way more horrors and finally the hero meeting up with a group of survivors who have the same simple goal as him: staying alive.  What&#8217;s left?  I imagine the second volume will have Rick and the rest of the survivors traveling across the country together in search of hope.  Should be a great ride, and I&#8217;ll definitely be on board to experience it.cters face.

We get the hero waking up and being thrust into a lost world, the hero travelling the highways and discovering myriad horrors on it, the hero arriving into the city and discovering even way more horrors and finally the hero meeting up with a group of survivors who have the same simple goal as him: staying alive.  What&#8217;s left?  I imagine the second volume will have Rick and the rest of the survivors traveling across the country together in search of hope.  Should be a great ride, and I&#8217;ll definitely be on board to experience it.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Yes. I'm going to do it. Compare it to their independent label(Hopeless Records) effort. \\"Waking the Fallen\\" was one of the most influential and original records of 2003.A perfect mix of harmony and brutality combined with precise songwriting and guitar riffs.Excellent. Now we have this.Okay I know this guy messed up his voice or what not but half of this album doesn't even sound like Avenged Sevenfold.They remind you of a really gay emo band for about half of the record. When they really do try they manage to rock you out. I personally liked \\"Blinded in Chains\\" a whole lot. Also \\"The Wicked End\\" has a cool like Movie type symphonic interlude in the middle. I like maybe three more songs on this album but the rest of it blows.I do respect them for not kicking their singer out just because he couldn't scream. This is loyalty and not many bands would do that.I was just dissapointed I didn't get an excellent metal record like I expected. Oh well!
B000669GAI|5.0|Loved Pearl Jam for the first 2 or 3 albums, but then they lost it. I could listen to their previous few records once and completely forget about them, with the exception of a standout track once in a great while. Hearing this brings up conflict - love for the truly great songs, and despair for \\"what could have been\\", as they've pretty much faded out. The collection makes me forget about the dreck heard in \\"Riot Act\\", and is a solid enough compilation to nearly let them off the hook for squandering their talent away.
1573223085|5.0|The author's crucial insight is that in an era of abundance companies must offer a unique and superior esthetic experience to compete effectively in the global economy. However, what this brave new world - the \\"new\\" new economy - means for the American worker isn't entirely clear, and we should take the author's optimism with a large grain a salt.  <br /> <br />The fact is that even in a world where mfas are considerably more respected by the suits than they are today, most mfas who go to work in corporate America will simply be cogs in the machine, carrying out the design work of ideas conceived by a small elite, and increasingly that grunt design and creative work is just as susceptible to outsourcing as manufacturing work, coding work, accounting work, etc. (an increasing amount of animation work for tv, video games, etc is being done abroad). And companies only need so many people hatching the next video game concept, or marketing scheme, or big idea.  <br /> <br />As has been asked of Tom Friedman, can we really all be a nation of animated feauture writers fetching a million dollars a picture? The logical conclusion would seem to be much darker than Mr. Pink's, which is (barring a significant correction) a trend toward even greater economic stratification, the further erosion of the middle class, with a small creative and managerial elite earning vast sums, and the majority fighting to scrape by. Something similiar has happened to every globalizating power in the west since the renaissance, and it has tended to end not in economic democracy for all but a bitter populist backlash (see Kevin Phillips' great book \\"Wealth and Democracy\\" for more about this).  <br /> <br />I give this book 5 stars not because I'm not skeptical of a good portion of what the author has to say, but because it is well crafted, thoughtful, and worth your time. And if you want to be a millionaire go read \\"the Millionaire Next Door.\\" Hard work, and low brow, low status businesses remain the surest path to fortune.
0618526412|5.0|There were a couple major things I noticed while reading this book.  One was of a dialectical sense.  The four main visitors of Mr. Singer are all lonely and feel lost.  They feel they have no one to talk to.  They turn to Mr. Singer, who they feel understands, even though he is deaf and mute.  He gives them hope and courage, so that they believe that their life's dream or mission or purpose is capable of being fulfilled.  But Mr. Singer is lost and lonely, too.  He has almost no idea what they are talking about, even when he understands what they are saying.  He is lost because his best friend is in an asylum, and he cannot really talk with anyone but him.  He is just as human as anyone else, and yet everyone looks up to him with a kind of awe.  He is what people want him to be, though he is not what anyone thinks him to be.  He is not God, but he has this Godlike aura about him.  He is symbolic of the hopes and dreams that people build upon, and of their loss.<br />A very moving and REAL story of people who believe in something so strongly that they devote their whole minds to it.<br />Their whole minds.
0743437497|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book that I have read. I am glad that I chose it. I have always hesitated to read his books or see the movies because I have always assumed that they would be full of slasher, murder scenes. I was pleasantly surprised that this book is more of a psychological thriller. In the 505 page book, there's really not a scary, gory scene until around page 200. King spends the first part of the book brilliantly developing the characters. His writing is stream of conscious, switiching between thoughts of characters mid-sentence. One would think that this would be hard to follow, but that is not the case. I have friends who have said that other Stephen King books are more gory than this one. Despite that fact, his descriptive writing is so addictive, I'm sure I will read more.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Honestly, I never gush over an album, but this one deserves it! The combined genius of Bacharach and Costello aside, this album is wonderful because there isn't a mediocre song in the bunch. We all know what it's like to have a cd where we love 10 out of the 12 songs (or whatever - probably not usually even that high of a percentage), and yet we are forced to skip over those 2 annoying songs or suffer through listening to them. That doesn't happen with this gem of an album. It's great all the way through. And it is so thought-provoking and entertaining. <br /> <br />Whether you like Bacharach or Costello or both (bonus!), you will appreciate and enjoy this collaboration. I am a fan of Costello, but I must admit that he's a hit-or-miss kind of songwriter. With Bacharach solidly writing the tunes, Costello shines like I haven't heard him in years! <br /> <br />The greatest thing about this album is that it is unobtrusive. You can listen to it in the background for hours, and there are no loud or out-of-place instruments which will alarm you. Yet, if you want to sit down and concentrate on the album word for word, song by song, you will not be bored. It is that satisfying! <br />
0380789035|5.0|I view this book as the best one of the triumvirate that contains Pratchett's _Small Gods_ and the joint effort _Good Omens_.  Pratchett used the similar idea about god strength relating the amount of worshipping they receive, but from a more humorous perspective.  Gaiman does it with a better written story here in _American Gods_, though still slyly humorous in many parts.
B0000062S0|5.0|I can't wait for the next Page & Plant album, they are unstoppable together.  This should have been the next Zepp album.
B00066VUPM|3.0|Travis is a band best remembered by forgetting all they did before their smashing \\"The Man Who\\" hit the shelves. Most of their earlier work can be overlooked without missing much, which turns \\"Singles\\" into mostly a compilation of hits from \\"The Man Who\\" and \\"The Invisible Band\\", both of which stand up as solid albums in their own right. My question, then, becomes: why not simply get those two albums and skip this one altogether? You are going to get the true best of the band, plus you will save yourself some time listening to their old-and-not-as-good material.
0385336810|4.0|Is this a literary masterpiece? No. However, it is one of the most funniest, entertaining books I have read in a long time.  And that is talent-being able to engage your reader and make them laugh.  Basically, this book is about a young entry level marketing rep who ends up spilling all of her secrets to a male stranger on a plane, when she thinks they're going to crash and die as a result of strong turbulence. Well, they don't crash, and this \\"stranger\\" ends up being the owner of the company she works for but who no one has ever seen-until after that flight.  The book then proceeds to ponder the question, Should we keep secrets? And is there a price? in a most hilarious way.
B0009ML238|3.0|These fellas sure know how to wail on their instruments.  I have nothing but very positive things to say about the technical abilities of the members of this band.  The unique vocals are also very good.  Unfortunately I also have negative things to say about this album.  Track by track review; <br /> <br />1. Sin- This song has quite a punch to it.  It grabs you from the start and doesn't let go.  The vocalist makes his claim as an excellent new vocalist in this song as he continues to do throughout the album.  Check out this song on their website.  It is one of the best on the album.  The guitar solo is very impressive and you can really here influence from Symphony X's Romeo, specifically the song \\"The Relic\\" from \\"Twilight In Olympus.\\"  All in all, great song.  Cool usage of keyboards and flashy musicianship. <br /> <br />2. Alive- The beginning of this song reminds me of \\"Caught In A Web\\" by Dream Theater.  Not as much punch as \\"Sin\\" but an equally good song with great guitars and vocals.  Another great song. <br /> <br />3. Glory Of The Empire- This song starts out similar to \\"The Accolade \\" from Symphony X and moves into some Symphony X-ish type chord changes.  After that, this song really begins to fall into its own.  Some Queensryche influence can be heard in this song but not much.  It is a cool more 80's sounding song at parts.  The first three songs really start this album off strong. <br /> <br />4. Biosfear- Ok, who named this song?  I think it is funny.  Very Dream Theater-ish arrangements.  Although, the original stuff that they do is great.  The keyboards sound like a mix of Sherinian, Ruddess, and Martin Hedin from Andromeda.  I really don't like this part about 2:40 into the song.  It sounds almost identical to Dream Theater's \\"Dance Of Eternity\\" from SFAM.  All in all, these cats can play but need to stop trying to be other musicians.  The keyboard solo is very Rudess-ish and the guitar solo very Petrucci-ish. <br /> <br />5. Silence From Angels Above- This is a soft song.  Excellent vocals.  Pretty guitars.  Keys are ok.  Similar to \\"Rediscovery (Segue)\\" from SX's \\"V\\" at times but not identical.  Good soft song.  Nothing new or spectacular but good. <br /> <br />6. Why Am I Here?- Great original prog metal here.  Awesome song.  Driving guitars.  Cool keys.  Great drums and vocals.  Excellent bass work! <br /> <br />7. Prophecy- First time I didn't make it all the way through this song.  It starts out with an acoustic guitar and the singer only.  Next, about a minute into the song it sounds as if they copied and pasted the beginning of DT's \\"About To Crash\\" from 6DOIT.  It is so blatant that I turned it off the first couple times I heard that part.  It then moves into heavier stuff but is too much of a rip off for my taste. <br /> <br />8. 1st Chapter- This is the 20 minute epic piece.  Don't get me wrong, Circus Maximus can about shred anyone under the table, but leave the epic songs to the adults.  This song is an attempt at recreating \\"The Oddesey\\" while maintaining a fair amount of DT influence.  I have not yet heard \\"Octavarium\\" but DT's first epic piece ACOS and both of SX's epic pieces blow this one away.  The beginning of 1st Chapter is very similar to the overture of \\"The Oddessey\\" the drum and keyboard playing in synch effect that they use is identical to the \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" part of \\"The Oddessey.\\" <br /> <br />9. Imperial Destruction- This song is only on the European release so I don't have it. <br /> <br />All in all this band has as much talent if not more than anyone as far as technical ability goes.  As far as originality there is much to be desired from this band.  The vocalist and vocal arrangements are the exception for this.  As this band grows in age and as a band hopefully they will become a superpower in the prog metal scene.  They certainly have the ability to do so.  They just need to grow into their own sound and their own approach as they demonstrate in the first three songsand track 6 (Sin, Alive, Glory of the Empire and Why am I Here?).
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I have to confess this is my first Muse cd.  I had never even heard a single song of theirs before today.  The first time I scanned this cd at a local store I was moved.  I loved Matthew Bellamy's voice and how tense it was.  That was something that stuck out for me was how passionate and tense his voice was.  I never knew when he was going to explode into falsetto or when he would just belt out a powerful chorus.  I am now a huge Muse fan after just one day.  This cd is that good.  The guitars are usually loud and the effects that Bellamy chooses are experimental.  The drummer Domini Howard has some unique rhythms to back up Bellamy's powerful voice and Chris Wolstenholme has some incredible bass riffs.  Muse is a perfect band for me because they have soaring melodies and beautiful intrumentation and Bellamy's lyrics are good too.  I don't care if they sound a lot like Radiohead.  Every band has their naysayers even the legendary U2.  Let me just say that Muse is incredible.  That is all I can say.  I can't pick a favorite song because I like basically all of them but there are a few that stick out and those are \\"Time is running out\\", \\"Sing for absolution\\" \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\".  Thanks and God bless.
0142401668|2.0|This book is about three/fourths great reading, 1/8 corny, and 1/8 unrealistic. Firstly, Alex is just a tad to perfect. The saftey of England, (GReat Britan, United Kingdom, Britan{without the great}. Comes second to the saftey of myself.     I'll complain about the never ending number of random guards the evil man has. This is a common flaw seen in movies. Where do they get all those people? Is there like a warehouse full of people stupid enough to get killed by a teenager? Hmmm...     It was an interesting read, that i finished fairly quickly. There is nothing hugely special, but don't pass it up either.     I have yet to read the last book \\"scopria\\" or something.     Happy endings are stories that haven't  finished yet.  -Qoute taken from Mr. +Mrs. Smith
B00006EXL5|5.0|I really really liked this album...I heard of my chemical romance when i got tickets to see green day and once i popped their albums in my stereo i've been a fan ever since... But anyway i like this album a little bit more than 3 cheers... 3 cheers is still a masterpiece but i like more of the fast paced guitars and the lyrics are just a little bit better on bullets... I don't really care that they are becoming mainstream... It's annoying but they are really talented and they deserve the money and all the exposure they are getting. Overall it's a very good album my personal favorites are \\"vampires will never hurt you\\" and \\"headfirst for halos.\\" If you are just starting to like MCR get this album first and then 3 cheers... Just you can see MCR before they became mainstream... I give this album 5 stars!!!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Why are the beatles considered the best group of all time? Is this some kind of joke? Songs like \\"Love me do\\" and \\"from Me to you\\" Really make you wonder why are these guys famous? The beatles are like the Backstreet boys. Dont buy this garbage.
7119005901|5.0|Four GREAT Chinese classics roam over Chinese Literature, and among those (Romance of the three kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, the Monkey King, and ShueyHudran), Romance of the three kingdoms is deemed as second place, right after the Dream of the Red Chamber. It is a work in the plot of the Three Kingdoms history book, which is written in ancient Chinese and is thus very hard to comprehend. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms however, is a very intriguing accomplishment. However, if one read the translation version, one must bear in mind that there are lots names very similar. I myself have read the Chinese version, which made it much easier to comprehend. The storyline is an adventure, and a great warning to imperialism. The three kingdoms stand in enmity and eventually none of them won. This is the Three-Kingdom tragedy, and the end of the Three-Kingdom dynasty. Lots of symbolism and fables to be interpreted. Very thoughtful and comprehensive, all plot tied up extremely conherently. The characters, as far as I know, are all real. China could not have thrived without the greatness of the Three Kingdoms, for it developed numerous Chinese proverbs, numerous location names, and numerous Gods to be worshiped. It is one of the greatest classics in the world, and it must be savored - every bit of it.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|In a world where winning is often secondary to almost everything and a lot of folks don't even stop to think of short- versus long-term wins, this story's about a man who dares to think a little bit differently.   <br /> <br />His name is Carter.  Back in the 70's, he was the star player for Riverside High.  He went on to college and now owns a sporting goods store in the old predominantly Black neighborhood, which isn't such a safe place anymore.  <br /> <br />When Carter is asked to coach his old school's losing basketball team, he accepts--but he sets higher standards for the players than the State requires.  The student-athletes must have a 2.3 GPA instead of a 2.0.  They must attend all of their classes and they must sit on the front row.  They must also wear ties to their games.   <br /> <br />Respect is the name of the game.  Carter stops the young men from using denegrating racial terms for each other,  demands they live up to their actions and their promises.  Do they win?  In a school where only half of the students graduate, 80% of the young Black males will probably end up in jail...yes, they win.   <br /> <br />Coach Carter confessed he didn't achieve his goals:  he started out to teach boys how to play basketball.  They turned to men.  He started out to teach them to win.  They became students.   <br /> <br />This film isn't just about basketball---I don't know a free-throw from a jump shot and I enjoyed this film.  When Coach Carter ordered the team to do 'suicides' I thought he literally meant it.  Okay, running non-stop from goal-line to goal-line and having to bend and touch those goal lines might just be suicide if you are out of shape like the team originally was. This film is about growing up and learning to use your full potential.  One of the best speeches from this film follows: <br /> <br />\\"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our dark that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people don't feel insecure around you.We are all meant to shine as children do. Its not just in some of us; its in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsiously give other people to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\\"
B00006D295|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST I'VE SEEN OUT OF HORROR, SCIENCE FICTION, MUSICAL, COMEDY B MOVIES. THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE RE-RELEASED ON A 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION!!!! BUY THIS DVD NOW!!!!
B00005JNJT|5.0|When I heard they were making another Batman movie, I couldn't believe they were doing it. After Batman and Robin, I thought what is wrong with these people. As a result, I was very, VERY hesitant to go see this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a loooooong time. <br /> <br />First off, Christian Bale makes an AMAZING Batman. I have always been impressed with Bale and thought he was/is a WONDERFUL actor and the role of Batman suits him perfectly. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman are all great in this film as well. I thoroughly enjoyed Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow and think he would make a great villian to come back in the future. <br /> <br />One of the best things about this movie is the focus is on Bruce Wayne and his history. The other Batman movies progressively focused on the villian(s) as opposed to the Dark Knight himself. Christopher Nolan and David Goyer did a wonderful job in showing the various, darker sides of Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br />I recommend this film to everyone. And I ask you to remember when going to see this that it is called Batman BEGINS. It is how Batman came to be, so it is not necessarily going to be as action-packed as movies of this sort tend to be. With that said, the action that is in the film is exciting and done very well. Batman Begins is done the way these movies should have been done all along...and it is FANTASTIC!
B0002EXH5O|2.0|I own the original (which I love) and listened to a couple of my favourite songs on the remixed edition and all I have to say is... THOSE NEW VOCALS ON \\"TAKE NO PRISONNERS\\" AND THE TITLE-TRACK JUST SLAP ME IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD! I hope Dave didn't dare to re-record parts on the demos. <br />The mix however is probably the only one apart from KIMB that wasn't ruined but the original was perfect. <br />The extra star is for \\"My Creation\\" which is lovely.
B00005JOGE|5.0|I watched the Live 8 concert all day and it was the closest i cam eto beauty in music.  I wanted to be in every city all at once and see every band.  I am not an emotional person in any way and i almost cried a few times.  The cause was worthwhile and the music was god damn amazing.  If anyone has alove for music, they should buy this DVD and fight for their cause!!!
B00000K3D4|5.0|While on the surface, this film may appear to be something wholly without sense or worth, it is certainly not as it appears. <br />Watching it once will not lead you to the deeper meanings inside of it. <br /> <br />This film often has a bad reputation, due to some who feel it was a mistake in David Bowie's career, feel that it was too commercial, don't take the time to actually read into the story, whatnot.  However, this bad reputation is undeserved. <br /> <br />The Labyrinth is anything that you want it to be. <br />Some interpret it to represent people from the Bible. <br />Some interpret it to be a journey into the underworld of Greek Mythology. <br />Some interpret it to be a psychologically gripping film about a person's subconscious trying to stop the conscious part of the mind from abusing it. <br />Some see nothing more than a silly/stupid/sappy/fairly good children's film, with a young girl braving perils in order to save her brother from a terrible fiend, and learning along the way. <br /> <br />I tend to feel it is more about psychology and the conscious/subconscious, therefore I would recommend it for that. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something in which to find deeper meaning, to make you think, something of substance, then I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> <br />See it, at least two times, look for what you can find in it.  You just might see yourself. <br /> <br />[Also, I highly recommend reading the essay which can be found at the following link:  [...] <br />Very worthwhile and will give deeper meaning to the film.]
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I picked up the CD from my friend's beach house, one hour before leaving, and was instantly hooked. She has an awesome voice, and the songs are very catchy. My favorites are Karma, You Don't Know My Name, Diary, Dragon Days, and When You Really Love Someone. I am not usually an R&B fan, but I found myself playing the album over and over again for a whole week (after downloading all the tracks from ITMS). I still play them from time to time, and they are still wonderful. Her previous album, Songs in a Minor (which I checked out later), is just as good.
1591396190|4.0|Why compete head on against competition in an already crowded market? Instead, create an entirely different market for yourself by reducing cost of your products and services while increasing value to the customers. This, of course, is MUCH easier said than done and it certainly has been written before.<br /><br />How does one implement the blue ocean strategy? There are four things:<br /><br />1)Eliminate the products and services which the customers do not want.<br />2)Reduce factors which does not provide high value.<br />3)Raise factors which adds value to the customer.<br />4)Create factors which add value to the customer.<br /><br />Again, nothing I haven't heard or read before. The real value added by this book is its emphasis on the need to \\"think out of the box\\" and occassionally focus away from the narrow boundaries of comparative competitiveness, marketing, technology, and strategy. Rather, some attention should always be given to the dominant strategy of creating an entirely different market by offering different types of products and services to fulfill a yet unmet demand.
B000002UAR|5.0|The best recording by the greatest band in the history of rock and roll- what more needs to be said? \\"Revolver\\" finds the Fab 4 effortlessly transforming their craft into a sound that influenced generations of followers. Perfectly bridging the \\"mop top\\" era of their initial success (which should not be underrated) with psychedelic flourishes (somewhat overbearing on the subsequent \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"), \\"Revolver\\" finds the Fabs at the apex of their career. One of the very rare recordings where every song is essential listening. Starr's drumming, Harrison's ringing guitar, McCartney's melodicism, and Lennon's lysergic vision all combine to make this historic recording a \\"sum greater than the parts\\". Its all here-- straight rock, raga-rock, ballads, soul, psychedelia-- all wrapped in the Beatles-cum-George Martin production second to none. Buy it now.
B00003OSSL|5.0|I loved this movie with its reflective ambience. The music was beautiful, the acting excellent, and I appreciate its subtleties more each time I watch it.  I also thought the script was well-written and interesting, and with an added \\"action\\" dimension, as Ford's character simultaneously pursues his duties as an internal-affairs cop. <br /> <br />To Harrison, Kristen, and Sidney: ignore the jaded critics and impatient whiners clamoring for their next adrenaline fix - you have produced a marvelous work. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the box-office scorecard (aka: $$) rules when it comes to sequels. <br /> <br />(I own the DVD and have also bought the soundtrack CD) <br />
B0002O0CM0|4.0|These are the kind of albums everyone wants to negatively judge before they even hear a note.  \\"No Jim Morrison! I hate it already!\\" But the truth is that this is some great music.  If you listen to the Doors only to here Morrison sing, you will obviously not like these.  If you listen to the Doors because you enjoy their cohesive ability to make great music, you will enjoy these albums.  Kreiger, Densmore, and Manzarek were enough of the Doors to still make great Doors music. The vocals are a step down from the great Morrison days, but they are not bad.  I like these albums also because they seem a little more complex and have a few cool spices like a kick-ass sax section.  Even I had some doubts before I heard it, but when I did here it, I realized these are two lost Doors albums that many people do not want to give credit to.
B00005JNJT|3.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is a far cry from the original TV series with Batman and Robin (Robin did not appear this time around). The original TV series involved lots of joking around, was less violent, and the \\"bad guys\\" were almost likeable. \\"Batman Begins\\" was a long, explosive portrayal of good vs. evil.  <br /> <br />I appreciated the fact that \\"Batman Begins\\" modeled good choices. For example, when Batman unwisely decided to take revenge on the murderer of his parents, his childhood friend declared, \\"Revenge and justice are two different things.\\" Revenge was portrayed as the bad choice, since it would have been the result of years of Batman's anger and bitterness. <br /> <br />Batman did eventually decide to follow truth, justice, and the American way in his quest to save Gotham City. However, the movie constantly protrayed Batman in one fight or another, or fighting an evil character spewing hallucinogenic gas. The evil of Gotham  City was graphically displayed. Therefore, I would not recommend this movie to younger children.  <br /> <br />If there is to be a sequel (and the movie undoubtedly sets us up for one), I hope there are more scenes involving interactions between Batman and his butler. The butler was the personification of wisdom and devotion; and, in my opinion, he carried this movie.
B00006G8K0|5.0|A great cast, great acting, beautiful costumes, and gorgeous cinematography make this my favorite Dracula movie.  <br /> <br />Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing deservedly earned their places in horror movie history with this one. Lee gives the Count a wonderful seductive flair (just watch the scene where he corners Mina in the bedroom and tell me I'm wrong). Cushing makes Van Helsing smart without being a know-it-wall and gives him a surprising athleticness that is very genuine. And kudos to the supporting cast, they were excellent as well. <br /> <br />All in all, a great movie. So far, no other Dracula movie has dethroned it as the best.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how amazing and revolutionary this film is. An instant classic, like  Pulp Fiction on mescaline but at the same time standing by itself as possibly the best comic book adaptation. I have all the confidence in the world saying that because watching this film is like watching the graphic novel come to life. You hear critics say that about countless adaptations, but with this one, that statemant is about as literal as it gets.<br /><br />The city itself is amazingly constructed, the characters are legendary and lovable, just about every one of them's bad news and has some sort of psychological defect, whether its delusional psychosis, Mania, or Sadism or all three or even more. The story and dialouge arent necessarily original or even serious, but its not really meant to be, this film is a valentine to the noir and pulp comics of the golden age. The cinematography is as brilliant as it is beautiful. I truly can't describe at all how great it all is, you just have to sit down and take it all in for yourself, though not recommended for the kiddies, since each scene is riddled with ultra-violence and T&A galore.<br /><br />quite simply, a movie miracle, 'nuff said...
B00069L0XG|4.0|These movies were both good sci-fi/ action/ horror movies that are still inferior to the Blade trilogy. So if you want to have the best sci-fi/ horror movies of the 2, Blade's better. If you want to have the classic, check out the Alien Quadrilogy, but if you just want to have some fun, buy this set. They're both good, solid movies with good suspense and great action and special effects.  <br />Resident Evil (# 1) is about a group of soldiers that must destroy a virus before it has a deadly effect on the world. <br />Resident Evil Apocalypse- Alice played by Mila Jockavich has to help fight the undead and has to rescue a missing girl.  <br /> <br />Both movies have good action scenes where you'll be like:\\" wow! That was cool!!\\" but the 2nd one is better with better action and more memorable stuff. I recommend them as rents to everyone and buys for absolute die hard funs. You'll just have a good time watching them.
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|wow. ive been diving into the PT back catalogue for the last couple of months, and this was the album i was looking forward to immenseley. all i can say is i havent been let down at all!!! <br /> <br />from start to finish, its pure gold and definitely a trip worth taking many times. there is not a dull moment anywhere, the solo at the end of phase I is one of the most pleasant moments ive heard. <br /> <br />i couldnt have asked for anything better than this, its in my top 3 PT albums for sure - if not the best. i suppose its mostly aimed at people into the ambient type of music but i imagined it to just be Robert Fripp type soundscapping which wouldnt have been a problem, but it contains alot of the style of music contained in The Sky Moves Sideways. its really rocking at parts too. <br /> <br />yea so i gave it 4 stars, not sure why i didnt give it 5 but its possibly worthy of it.
B00081912E|4.0|This movie is another Jim Carrey movie that delivers. It's got great laughs, good visual effects and Jim Carrey is so into it that you'll be laughing your head off. The movie is about a geekish banker who gets his big break when he finds a mask that makes him turn into a green faced comical lunatic.  <br />When Carrey puts on the mask, you'll be anxious and waiting on the edge of your seat for the next time he does it because when he's the mask, he's just hilarious. <br />Jim Carrey dominates this movie. He's so hyper and pumped up that he perfectly adapts for when he puts on the maks and you won't ever want it to end. It's just great fun.  <br /> <br />And by the way, how could anyone, even a kid, be scared of this movie????????????
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|This DVD is a shame. <br />I agree with the reviewer who listed <br />all the performances that are left out. <br />What the stupid were they thinking? <br />Billy Ocean was my favorite artist in the 80s <br />and his two performances at JFK in Philadelphia are left out. <br />I only would have bought the DVD had it been included,  <br />but I won't. <br />Warner/Elektra, Stupid shame on you! <br /> <br />Scott <br />
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I was excited about this movie when I first heard about it. I really like the Blade movies and the plot seemed realy cool. I was expecting a unique and god story and some awesome action and special effects. Well.... <br />The movie is about an ongoing battle between vampires and their arch enemies, werewolves. But, crossed between this fight is a vampire that falls for a werewolve. The movie has a neat and cool opening fight and then... Well, the movie's plot started to bore me and there was too much talking. It was a pretty boring movie and I found myself dozing off at times. Also, Kate Beckinsale fires her uzi guns like 5000000000000 times before finally reloading. How many bullets does it hold? And also, she seems to fire a lot but hits mostly the walls. Also, the fights weren't very exhilirating. And it would have been really cool if the vampires would have like jumped off walls to dodge the werewolves but no.. The final scene is fun and cool but I had to wait through a lot of boring stuff and just useless scenes. And the fights weren't cool like Blade's, they were just a little dissapointing.  <br />But, it's an ok rent with some good special effects, a couple good fights and a good conclusion.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I could say everything I want to about this CD in just that one word... But of course I am not going to stop there... <br /> <br />First of all... to those who rated this CD a one star... What are you listening to??? It surely couldn't have been what I had in my CD player... You people really need to lighten up... This is music we are talking about... not life and death... If you have truly been fans all along you would know that she has a very broad mix of talent... I remember way back when Pies Descalzos came out and she was doing a little bit of everything back then too... She had songs like 'Estoy Aqui' and 'Donde estas Corazon' as well as songs like 'Pienso en ti' on the same album... To those who mentioned the fact this is a Spanish album... Yes it is... and you will have to wait less than 4 months for another English album to come out. <br /> <br />To those who are undecided... If you liked that mix of sounds on her previous CD's you will like them here too... That voice of hers and the passion she has in every word she writes is still so amazing. I highly recommend it... Ignore the one star ratings and make the decision for yourselves... It is a no win situation with some people... If she gives them new stuff... they want the old Shakira... if she keeps the old stuff because it's what works... they want new... If you have reservations listen to a sample of each song on this website before you purchase... It will make you that more sure you want to buy this CD...  <br />You do not have to take my word for it... look at the proof on this site... over 90 percent of the people who posted here have rated this four star or better...
B0002OERI0|4.0|They're all grown up now & their music reflects the same. This is definately one of their best albums since Dookie & Nimrod.<br /><br />It might sound a tad commercial but it works. The influences on this album are quite a few but the punk music undertone is quite clearly the driving force.<br /><br />Verdict: If you like Green Day then buy this album. If you don't like Green Day then you'll like them after you buy the album. American Idiot is one of those Albums that will be around for a while.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars for a praiseworthy album in a time when rock music is taking a hit.
B000957O82|5.0|Before you even see \\"Hitch\\", it's tempting to write the movie off as harmless fluff-a Will Smith star vehicle at best.  Just look at the cheesy Hollywood styling of the poster: Smith leaning on the word \\"Hitch\\" with an I'm-so-smooth grin, daring your expectations to be anything above waist-level.  Will Smith as the Date Doctor, selling his charm to nobodies-makes you want to rent Meet the Fockers again, doesn't it?  Fact is, \\"Hitch\\" does exactly what 90 percent of romantic comedies fail to do: sell you on its charm.  The writing abounds with cleverness and laugh-out-loud moments.  Urbane matchmaker Hitch has truer things to say about women and dating than Mel Gibson could learn through telepathy in \\"What Women Want.\\"  Finally, Smith gets a role where his mastery of gesture matches smart dialog line for line.  And true to Hitch's belief in non-verbal communication, the movie boasts some great physical comedy.  Once you've seen nebbish accountant Albert cut loose on the dance floor, you'll know what I mean.  Dare yourself to give this movie a chance.  It's hilarious and true, the best Hollywood surprise to come along in years.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I was introduced to this CD by my cousin way back when it first came out.  I listened to it and after awhile I thought it was so good,  i went out and bought my own. The worst things on the album are the \\"Lil Jimmy Skit\\" and the \\"School Spirit Skit\\" although they can be easily avoided by a skip button.  Another problem was that the song called \\"School Spirit\\" is edited even though it is on the explicit version which can get annoying after listening for a while.  The best songs are \\"Spaceship\\" \\"Through the Wire\\"  and \\"Last Call (which is very long although kanye tells his whole story on the road going from producer to rapper.)\\" The best CD in my collection. I am also looking forward to his next album called \\"Late Registration\\" which comes out August 16, 2005.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|mystical, psychedelic rock perfection transmuted through a genius who was here for only so long, but left a profound, everlasting art.
B000002OCP|5.0|Electric Mud is easily one of the finest albums ever recorded.  Many of these reviews, and other articles I have seen on the subject are at best mistaken and at worst downright ignorant.  First of all, Muddy Waters did not dislike this album, that is mularkey. <br /> <br />As a corollary to that, the idea that because he once said the drums were too \\"busy\\" we should all assume that he hated the album, and if he hated the album it must not be good, is preposterous. Unlike most other uninformed comments regarding this statement; I can offer you an accurate and meaningful explanation. <br /> <br />The drummer who performed on this album was a gentleman named Morris Jennings, an excellent studio musician tasked with an interesting job. Help take Muddy Waters' music and convert it into what could be the most accurate demonstration of \\"blues/rock\\" ever made. To do this, he understandably worked hard to drive the songs in a way that people would equate with the popular bluesy psychedlic rock of the day, of who Jimi Hendrix was the prime example. <br />  <br />Jimi's band was drummed by a gentleman named Mitch Mitchell, a great name by the way. But in a way Mitch doesn't even matter, because he was nothing but an intermediary.  He had admittedly taken his style from a person with an even better name, Philly Joe Jones. <br /> <br />Philly Joe Jones, who in my estimation is easily one of the top 5 drummers of all time.  Now Philly Joe was known for being \\"busy\\", but in Philly's case you wouldn't even say that. This cat was more than just \\"busy\\", Philly Joe was in control.  I can attest to this because of at least 2 accurate stories. <br />  <br />One, Philly Joe Jones was in the audience of a Maynard Ferguson show when he was asked to sit in and play a tune or 2.  He did so, and promptly had them playing the best set they ever played. When their drummer returned and tried to do the same thing, it was no use, the magic was gone.  It was Philly who was driving them making themplay harder, and better than they had before.   <br /> <br />Second story, Philly was sitting in with some name guys at a jam session at a local college class.  One of the cats was a professor, so they were hanging and jamming for the students.  At one point Philly played something so wild, he actually blew them all off. In square terms, they were just so mystified by something he did, they just stopped. He said, \\"Nuthin happenin here\\" and then laid out an absolutely ridiculous solo. What does all this mean? That was the style. Everyone who played with a drummer like that said the drums were too \\"busy\\". It was a driving, maybe even suffocating style that could be fantastic when done right, but it would always perturb the other musicians because it would push them out of safety. <br /> <br />This album,in many ways, is one white record producer's attempt, either for profit or pride, to finally bridge the gap between the people who had bought all that stolen blues, and the people who it was stolen from. It is a fantastic album and extremely one of a kind.  Everyone who plays on this is highly skilled; they are excellent studio musicians and actually the perfect people for this job.  Who better to help Muddy transform his sound into something that retained its integrity, but had a quality that would make it more potent to a larger audience.  These guys had done the same thing for a slew of white musicians, why not have them do the same for someone who deserved the recognition.  Now maybe that was a calculated move for profit, or an attempt to fix something that went simply went wrong in the world of music. Who knows and who cares?  The end result is highly listenable, singular as all get out, and after a while it just downright beautiful.  DO NOT DISMISS THIS ALBUM, if you do there is a 95% probability that you are a pretentious blunderhead.
B00006JDVV|5.0|It was well made. The effects are dazzling and the actors well chosen. If you're into dragons, it's an interesting theory. Watch it for fun.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Overloaded supernatural thriller that manages to not only insult the people who are fans of the comic book which this film is based on but insults the audience with one of the worse written and feebly plotted films in history. You will not only take apart this film for it sheer lack of a story but you would want to take Keanu Reeves head off for giving one of his worse performance ever in a major film. He's so bad in fact that you just would want to turn away from him every time he is on screen because of how bad his performance is. The really sad thing about this film is the fact that there are two very good performances that almost makes you want to like the movie you are watching. The first and best of these performance belongs to Rachel Weisz, whose dark and rich performance as a homicide cop makes you take a pause and wonder on how much potential this film could have had if they could have just centered the film around her and her character. She not only gives an amazing performance but also almost redeems Keanu's horrible acting as well, which is not a very easy thing to do. I agree with almost every review written that she is not only the best thing about the movie but she is its real heart and soul. The second good performance in the film belongs to Peter Stormare, who very, very brief role as the devil himself has more scares and more tension than the movie itself.  He's not only campy but sly and dangerous as well and his brief introduction at the end of the film almost saves the last act of the movie, which is ruined by a very bad plot point that makes absolutely no sense at all and was not even hinted at during the course of the entire film. Unfortunately for both Weisz and Stormare plus the audience themselves, the movie is more of a showcase for very bad computer effects that loses it's impact after the first three minutes of the film than a character study on good and evil and that's where the movie falters. It rather insult the audience than treat them with respect and if they had better people behind the scenes making this film, this would have been a real movie with some substance other than a over flashy Keanu Reeves film with no soul. <br /> <br />Imagine how good this film would have been if you had the good script, tight direction and based it around Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare great performances. That would have been golden.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|Chris Martin has become the new \\"Bono, Michael Stipe and Paul  McCartney\\" of his generation. The lyrics, the voice, the sound;   they come alive together!!! Once again Coldplay does not disappoint. Songs like \\"Square one, Low, Fix you and Speed of Sound\\" are instant classics!  May this band continue to make great music for decades to come! P.s, Coldplay was great at \\"Live 8 2005.\\"
0195102681|3.0|The \\"Microeconomic Theory\\" textbook,written by A Mas-Colell,M D Whinston,and J R Green,is not the best textbook for a beginning graduate student in microeconomic theory who wants to UNDERSTAND what is going on.The problem with this text is not the level of mathematics used in the exposition .There are two problems with the text.The first problem is the choice of mathematical notation.Mastering just the notation alone will sidetrack a beginning graduate student.The second problem is the framework used to explain the underlying set theoretic concepts and the integration of the set theoretic approach into the various chapters.The language chosen is like that  of a senior level Real Analysis course in a mathematics department such as \\"Principles of Real Analysis\\",by C D Aliprantis and O Burkinshaw(1981),although no real analysis is actually presented by Mas-Collel or his coauthors in their textbook.The best introductory text for a graduate micro course that promotes understanding is the long forgotten and badly underestimated 1986 book by Frank A. Cowell,titled \\"Microeconomic Principles\\".Cowell has recently come out with another similar microeconomics text in 2005.I have not read this book so I have no idea about its relative merits.In my opinion,Cowell's 1986 book is also superior to both H R Varian's and D M Kreps's introductory ,graduate micro course textbooks.
B00007KQA3|3.0|It *is* wise to read the book before watching the movie as the film did not describe Newspeak, thoughtcrime, or the politics of the continuing war with Eastasia/Eurasia.  As a previous reviewer pointed out, this is going to lead to big gaps for someone who doesn't have a clue as to what the characters are referring to in the movie.<br /><br />The film did a so-so job of bringing to life the picture of the totalitarian world of Oceania and of Winston Smith's love affair and his thoughtcrimes of actually remembering bits and pieces of his childhood and trying to find who *he* was and not who Big Brother wanted him to be.<br /><br />In Richard Burton's last film, he played a wicked O'Brien but you could feel the lack of chemistry between him and John Hurt.  This was especially evident during Smith's \\"reeducation\\" in the Ministry of Love of the ways of Big Brother and who Oceania was at war with (which kept changing every 5 seconds).<br /><br />The book is way better than the movie.
B000002H97|5.0|Around 1989, 1990, while on tour for their fifth album, ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, James Hetfield had a serious accident. They were performing in Toronto, or wherever it was in Canada, Metallica had pyro explosions coming from their stage, giving off an edge to their show. James had been getting into the particular song they were playing. As he stepped forward, a pyro-flame blasted him, causing him to catch on fire. Luckily, he was rushed to the hospital, where he was treated. Turns out that he was not badly hurt. The burns left rarely noticeable scars. <br /> <br />In 1991, after James had fully recovered from his injury, Metallica had released their sixth album entitled, METALLICA, simply self-titled. Metallica not only refers to this album as their self-titled album, they also refer to this album as THE BLACK ALBUM since the front cover is all black, with the band's name in the top right-hand corner. This album is actually my favorite Metallica album.  <br /> <br />ENTER SANDMAN  <br />This is one of the best songs on this album. Just about every Metallica fan, whether those fans hated this album or not, should have heard and loved this song. It is, indeed, a classic.  <br /> <br />SAD BUT TRUE  <br />Another great song. Kid Rock had actually used this song's music for his 2000 song, \\"American Bad Ass\\", which kind of ticked me off because I am very used to hearing the music behind James' voice, along with this song's lyrics.  <br /> <br />HOLIER THAN THOU  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />THE UNFORGIVEN  <br />This song is my first of two favorites from this album. I just love the way James sings the verses with the edgy metal tone in his voice and then changes his voice to a softer tone with the choruses. This song is just amazing.  <br /> <br />WHEREVER I MAY ROAM  <br />When I heard this song's introduction, I knew I was going to like it. But I was wrong. I did not like the song. I loved the song. You cannot say you just simply like this song. You have to say that you love it because the song's sound. The introduction alone is just simply classic.  <br /> <br />DON'T TREAD ON ME  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />THROUGH THE NEVER  <br />Outstanding.  <br /> <br />NOTHING ELSE MATTERS  <br />This song is my second of two favorites on this album. Throughout the whole song, with the exception of at least one or two verses, James' voice is in that soft pleasing tone. I usually hate it when a heavy metal band's lead singer sings softer on a ballad, but only James can pull off that soft tone on a song like this. So, James is the only exception with having the chance to sing in a softer tone as he does on this song, as well as \\"The Unforgiven\\".  <br /> <br />OF WOLF AN MAN  <br />When I read the title to this song, I thought it was about the difference between wolves and humans. But after hearing it, I found that it was about...Werewolves. I would love to see a new werewolf movie made with this song as the main theme.  <br /> <br />THE GOD THAT FAILED  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />MY FRIEND OF MISERY  <br />Unbelievable.  <br /> <br />THE STRUGGLE WITHIN  <br />Incredible.  <br /> <br />Most fans will consider this album to be Metallica's sell-out album, but those fans are wrong, because this album is amazing. As I said earlier, this is my favorite Metallica album and it will be for years to come. Pick up a copy and make this album your favorite Metallica album.
0140366822|5.0|The story of Pollyanna, the girl of gladness or as later called in the beautifully done anime series from 1986, the girl of love, is a tale of pure wonder that will stay within you forever. This book is for children and grown-ups, for anyone will find the simple beauty of this book, followed by a sequel that was just as wonderful.  <br /> <br />After her father's death, the newly-orphaned ten-year-old Pollyanna moves to Beldingsville to live with her strict and dutiful Aunt Polly. In this great new house Pollyanna is at first kept sleeping up in the attic room, for Aunt Polly feels that that is enough for her to accomplish her 'duty.' If not for Old Tom and good, kind house-keeper Nancy, Pollyanna's stay would have been very dull indeed. Although she never realized it, Pollyanna has a great talent, a great gift for gladness. Just by talking she manages to bring life and joy into the lives of her loved ones, and everyone Pollyanna knows is a 'loved one' as she sees it. Little Pollyanna is one day sent to visit the old invalid woman, Mrs. Snow, her illness keeping her in a gloomy room under old bed-sheets. Mrs. Snow is unhappy and hopeless, but soon Pollyanna cheers the woman up with her usual gladness that seems to be very contagious.  <br /> <br />At a very young age, Pollyanna was taught by her father a little game, today known as the 'Glad Game.' Being poor and depending on charities to keep alive, Pollyanna and her father received barrels containing supplies and needed things. Pollyanna had wished that one of these would contain a pretty doll, which never arrived, a pair of crutches arrived instead. Pollyanna had naturally cried, but her father told her that she could be 'glad' that she didn't 'need' them, and that's when the game of finding a silver lining in every cloud began.  <br />The 'Glad Game' was soon known to everyone in the town, from the cross Mr. John Pendelton to the \\"trying-hard-ter-learn-ter-play-it\\" Nancy. Everyone that is, except for good Aunt Polly. For reasons unknown to Pollyanna, Aunt Polly had forbidden the mentioning of her late father and for this, Pollyanna cannot let her know of the game, since Pollyanna is known for taking everything literally.  <br />However, very dark clouds surround the town of Bendinsville when little Pollyanna is hit by a speeding automobile and loses her ability to walk, so dark these clouds are, that not even Pollyanna knows how she'll be able to find a silver lining in them. I shall write no more, for the rest is for the reader to discover.  <br /> <br />Pollyanna may at first be accused of having similarities to 'Anne of Green Gables' and maybe even 'Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,' but those will only last during the first few chapters, \\"Pollyanna\\" soon changes into a very original (And quite interesting) novel. This book is anything but dull, as a previous reader and reviewer had stated, and you simply cannot make such a remark after only having read \\"the first few chapters.\\" Pollyanna will delight its readers, but its whole wonder cannot be lived until the wonderful sequel, \\"Pollyanna Grows Up\\" is read as well. It's true, when you meet Pollyanna, imagining her all grown up is hard, but although she grew older, she never did really change.
B000002H6C|5.0|In 1988, Metallica had released their fifth album entitled, ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. This album is just outstanding in every way there is in this world.  <br /> <br />BLACKENED  <br />This song is just amazing. It rocks like you wouldn't believe. Kirk's lead guitar solo is just pure amazing and I can't get help it when I get the chills from hearing it.  <br /> <br />...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL  <br />Another amazing title track from Metallica. Just awesome and raw edge.  <br /> <br />EYE OF THE BEHOLDER  <br />Another great song. About 11 years after this album, Ewan McGregor & Ashely Judd had starred in the suspense/action film of the same name. This song would have been perfect that film's theme, even though there is an 11-year gap between the two.  <br /> <br />ONE  <br />This song is the best off of this album. Metallica decided to continue with their war tunes here. Now, as much as I love this song, I cannot stand watching the video, since it literally scares the everloving sh*t out of me. The performance scenes with the band are great, but the movie scenes, which were taken from the film, JOHNNY GOT HIS GONE (1971), are extremely terrifying. In that film, the main character was fighting in the first World War, where he fell into land mine and was blown up, where he lost his arms, legs, his sight, and voice, but he was still alive. In the hospital, he keeps talking to himself, screaming in his mind, SOMEBODY KILL ME! HELP! His voice alone scares the sh*t out of me. The lyrics to this song are exact to the 1971 film, which is why the guys put some clips in the video. I think I might've had a few nightmares from this song's music video.  <br /> <br />SHORTEST STRAW  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />HARVESTER OF SORROW  <br />Not bad.  <br /> <br />THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY  <br />The song starts off with the March Of The Guards chant from the infamous film, THE WIZARD OF OZ and then slips into a killer heavy tune about people starting off paranoid, leading them into the stages of insanity.  <br /> <br />TO LIVE IS TO DIE  <br />I think the reason for putting this on the album was a tribute to their old friend, Cliff Burton, since the lyrics written here are indeed his. The guys know how to show their loyalty to their late friend and band mate.  <br /> <br />DYER'S EVE  <br />Ending the album with this song was a great choice. Just an awesome album.  <br /> <br />Cliff may be absent with this album, as he as on Metallica's future albums, but Metallica wanted to move on and to continue pleasing their fans. Releasing this album was just what Metallica wanted to do in moving on to please their fans. This album is just fantastic, as usual.
B000002GEY|4.0|sent empty CD case first time around.  very courteous and reliable in sending entire CD and case in a quite timely fashion.  would buy here again.
B00002ND77|5.0|Denzel Washington gives the performance of his career in this film. Forget Al Pacino in \\"Scent of a Woman\\" - an Oscar was reportedly awarded to AP to make nice for a previous, unrewarded & more deserving performance in a movie whose name escapes me (as Denzel's Oscar for \\"Training Day\\" some years later was for this picture)...Washington's work in/as Malcolm X was unquestionably the best by any actor in 1992, truly capturing the man's ascension from street hustler/convict to revolutionary/national figure. Angela Bassett is wonderful as Malcolm's wife Betty, Delroy Lindo is sharp as West Indian Archie, & Albert Hall is excellent as Brother Baines. There's the usual heavy-handed Spike Lee ending which I hoped to avoid given his otherwise well-measured direction, but that should not dissuade you from seeing this amazing motion picture.
6301763041|5.0|this movie was one of the best films i have seen in a while with jhonny depp in.also he looks so hot in this movie compared to the oyher films.i could watch it 1000 times and never get sick of it.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Very strong album overall.   Playing it all the way through in it's entirety leaves one very satisfied.  You should not buy this album if you want an updated version of any previous Oasis album - because this is not it.   Oasis fans will know that each of the band's albums has it's own distinct musical flavour - Don't Believe The Truth is no exception.  The album starts out heavy (a typical Oasis gesture) with a great song, Turn Up The Sun.  Other standout tracks include Love Like A Bomb (good Liam vocals), Guess God Thinks I'm Abel (very cool ending to this song - I wish they extended it into a full length song itself), Keep The Dream Alive and Let There Be Love.   Let There Be Love (sentimental a la Stop Crying Your Heart Out) is a very strong song - Liam and Noel trade vocals on the verses.        The songs on which Noel sings are weaker overall - Mucky Fingers and The Importance of Being Idle.  I have noticed this pattern over and over since Noel started doing more vocals.  I really do think the album would be stronger without having Noel sing.    By the way, The Importance of Being Idle is where Britpop meets Country & Western - a new and interesting sound!  I do miss the hyperactive snarl of Oasis' earlier songs.   Well, they've grown up.  Don't we all?
B0009NSE1K|4.0|When I listened to this cd the day it was released. I was disappointed. This album seemed boring. I was digging the music, it was just all sounding the same. <br /> <br />So, I put it away for a while, and came back to it a week later and was in love with it. The organ in the songs is an excellent addition to the band, and makes you wonder why they didn't do it a long time ago. I personally believe the instrumentals are the best songs on the record, and create one of the most perfect three-song stretches I have ever heard (Small Upsetters to Circus Maximus to Tripping the Alarm) <br /> <br />Another great thing about this album is that, like all of their records, this is slightly a different view of Clutch. This is a bluesier Clutch than we're used to. And, there's nothing wrong with that at all. <br /> <br />This record is truly great, even if it take a couple listens to get into it. Pick it up.
B0000584V3|5.0|It is also, among other things, yet ANOTHER masterpiece from Swedish metal gods Opeth. <br /> <br />This was probably the first death metal album I heard and liked. Somehow instead of sounding over the top and contrived like many other death metal bands did to me at the time, it was a work of genius. Their songs are not only powerful, but emotional and catchy as well. Mikael Akerfeldt's singing - both his apocalyptic growls and his heavenly clean vocals - can inspire fear or bring tears to your eyes. I was blown away by the wall of greatness that hit me upon first hearing \\"The Leper Affinitiy\\". <br /> <br />Compared to previous Opeth albums, Blackwater Park has the biggest influence from progressive music. But unlike other progressive metal bands like Dream Theater, Cynic or Spiral Architect they do not sacrifice emotion and melody for complexity. Instead, Opeth integrate it into their music to create a depth that other death metal bands simply do not have. <br /> <br />Blackwater Park is deserving of every bit of praise it gets - it has no weak points, and is one of the few extreme metal albums that I could imagine someone who has never heard death metal before liking.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Coldplay did this amazing record. You might have heard of it. It's called A Rush of Blood to the Head. This cd, X&Y, is the exact opposite of that cd. It's amazingly terrible. <br /> <br />Let's compare: <br /> <br />AROBTTH:Unique sound, XY:Sound like Sleepy U2 <br />AROBTTH:Beautiful, creative lyrics, XY:Stupid, dumb lyrics <br />AROBTTH:Great songs, XY:Every song sounds the same <br /> <br />The only good song on here is the first single off of the record. Buy the single, don't even look at the actual CD. This CD is worth no ones time and is a complete disappointment on every level. I would write more, but why? This record doesn't deserve a review, period.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Not only is this movie an enigma, it is also rich thematically.  Teddy, \\"the liar,\\" often tells it like it is and becomes the audience's source for actually figuring out what is going on.  The movie plays with time (reverse chronology) and asks us how genuine are our own memories. Do we filter memory like Leonard does (b/f and after the tragedy) in order to make ourselves feel happier?  How many of our memories are reliable?  To what extent are our memories self-serving, interpretive, and/or inventive?<br />It took me awhile after the movie to synthesize all that was going on--very interesting and will have its viewers on the edge of their seats. Humor is interspersed throughout the movie for the much-needed comic relief.
037571457X|4.0|Most admirers of the Persepolis books see them as a heart-warming tale of a young girl's struggle to grow up and stay true to self in the face of Islamic repression. Satrapi, in her first volume, makes herself look like Ramona Quimby, the \\"little sparkler\\" from the children's series that charmed American readers years ago.<br /><br />  But this ain't no kid's funny-book. If Persepolis were a movie, it would rate a hard \\"R\\" for depictions of sexual situations, torture, violence, nudity, depictions of bathroom functions, and plenty of bad language.<br /><br />  Even so, many thousands of American and European fans today take Marjane Satrapi to their hearts, especially the little version. Again, we believe it's a Ramona Quimby thing. In other words, Satrapi's audience, mostly females between the ages of 18 and 40, convince themselves that she is just like them: young, smart, spunky and cute, with solid middle-class though not middle-American) credentials, making lots of mistakes and learning from them while making her way in a crazy world.<br /><br />  But anybody who knows a little about the Middle East will instantly recognize that's not exactly right: there are certain factors, below the radar of most North Americans, that critically affect how Satrapi's story must be interpreted and understood.<br /><br />  First of all, little Marji and her family are not really modern middle-class types as we understand them in the USA. These people are stone-cold blue-bloods: the kind of people the Egyptians call pashas, and the Bostonians, brahmans.  Marji's great grand-dad on her mother's side was the last emperor of the dynasty toppled by the first Pahlevi ruler with British help; when her father tells her the story, he emphasizes, with some indignation, that Reza Shah was just an illiterate low-ranking officer.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, Marji's dad manages to settle down comfortably under both the Pahlevis and the \\"Islamic Republic.\\" He has a place in the \\"chic\\" part of town and an expensive car. When the Revolutionary Guards catch him with wine on his breath, he has the bribes handy. If his only daughter smacks her principal, he can get her into another school. He and his wife won't ever leave Iran to seek the \\"freedom\\" of the West; he'd rather keep what he has than become a cabbie in the USA.<br /><br />  Marji's family are the descendants of princes, and committed Marxists. For the Satrapis, there is no contradiction: \\"Only a prince (in Iran) can allow himself to have a conscience.\\" Marji's parents do not believe in Allah, but buy her books and comics explaining basic communist theory.<br /><br />  Stay alert and it becomes obvious that Marjane Satrapi really isn't a recovering Muslimah at all; she was never taught to be one in the first place. For her, Islam will always be that foreign religion that the Arab invaders imposed upon her gentle Zoroastrian ancestors.<br /><br />  And so,\\"Islam\\" does not interest Satrapi; she does not really care whether Khumayni's government by ayatullah \\"philosopher-kings\\" makes Islam work, or makes the lives of people she doesn't know better. Instead, she judges the Islamic Republic by what it does to her family, its friends, and to her. Towards the end of Volume 1, 14-year-old Marji has the courage to rebuke a teacher who claims that the Islamic Republic of Iran (the same entity that shot her Uncle Anoosh) did not hold political prisoners. Unfortunately, Satrapi slips from this height, and starts despising the Khumayni r&eacute;gime mainly because it won't let her have make-up and Nikes.<br /><br />  Of course, most of Satrapi's western admirers will think this is courageously standing up to the narcs of Islamic repression. However, a more critical reading of Marjane Satrapi's young life raises some nagging questions: do her collisions with Muslim and non-Muslim authority figures throughout betray a love for liberty and the Rights of Man, as her parents and grandmother seem to think? Or do they represent the whims of a spoiled young princess, the only daughter of a rich family used to getting her way?<br /><br />  As Part 1 ends,things get too hot for Marji in her neighborhood; and her parents send her away to Europe. A cynical reader might wonder: are they getting her out of the way because her big mouth and out-of-control behavior threaten to mess up their lives-we're not being mean; the issue raises its scaly head, briefly, in the second volume.<br /><br />  Even so, both volumes of Persepolis are worthwhile reading for concerned adult Muslims. They badly need to understand the heads of people who don't like Islam. Satrapi's book in itself is a sincere testimony, from one convinced that she is telling her truth about life and politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran. That assumes, of course, that readers take the usual precautions with autobiographers, who often indulge in justifying themselves or settling old scores.a spoiled young princess, the only daughter of a rich family used to getting her way?  <br />     As Part 1 ends,things get too hot for Marji in her neighborhood; and her parents send her away to Europe.

B0009IW9DE|5.0|While 1985 seminal SCARECROW remains the signature John Mellencamp album, THE LONESOME JUBILEE, in my opinion, is his greatest musical achievement.  Both discs have a lot to say, lyrically speaking.  But whereas Scarecrow scored the messages with 60's-influenced rock, Jubilee expands this sound to include more rustic instrumentation.  The result is a pleasure to hear, as Mellencamp and his band effortlessly (or so it seems) make every song a keeper.  Even potentially heavy-handed material such as \\"We Are the People\\" and \\"Empty Hands\\" (with one of my favorite lines, \\"They say people get what they deserve/But Lord, sometimes it's much worse than that\\") is served up with such conviction that it's hard to fault their earnestness.<br /><br />Unreleased material (the bonus track) is, of course, always welcome.  But as someone has already mentioned, it sure would have been nice to have the b-sides from Jubilee's singles on the disc.  Or even John's VERY SPECIAL CHRISTMAS contribution, \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,\\" which was released shortly after this album came out.<br /><br />But I've still got my treasured 45's, so I can live with it.  In any event, if you only get one Mellencamp remastered disc, this is the one.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Long-time Shakira fans had to be a little disapointed in \\"Laundry Service.\\" I know I was. From \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\" (her best album), \\"Laundry Service\\" was regression for her as an artist. <br /> <br />Years later, she released \\"Fijacion Oral,\\" and now I am assured she is only progressing as a musician. This is definitely a must-have album for Shakira fans.
006016848X|2.0|Devoted fans will notice that John Gray has even written an exercise book now. Did you ever ask yourself what expertise prepared him to write his Mars/Venus book in the first place? Is he really the best person to be guiding consumers through major relationship decisions? For that matter, is self-help in general cost-effective? Is there any proof? Which types of it are worthwhile--and which are outright scams? Is it possible that self-help can do more harm than good to you and the people you love? Do its basic premises make sense...or do they break down under deeper scrutiny? Is there a downside to being uplifted? What have been the wider social costs of self-help to society, industry, and American children?  <br /> <br />You won't find the answers to these important questions in books written by people named Gray, McGraw, Williamson, Robbins, Schlessinger, or any of the other established icons or rising stars of the self-help industry. (And make no mistake: Self-help is an industry--to the tune of some $8.56 billion in annual revenues.) The more you feel that you need a little help in life, the more you owe it to yourself to take a look at my book, SHAM: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless. It's a painstaking, carefully documented look at the self-help industry. You can find all you need to know about it right here on Amazon, before making a decision about whether to buy. Even just reading its reviews may save you money on the worthless stuff.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is Mariah's best album since Fantasy! The album starts out Excellent and stays that way until the very end. 'It's Like that' is one of the hottest tracks this year, rivaled only by the number one hit-'We belong together.' The great thing about the album is that I am not a big fan of rap music, and yet some of my favorite tracks include Snoop Dogg, Twista, and Nelly. This album has a great blend of R&B, hip hop and power ballads. Great job Mariah, you have made me a fan again.

B000003TAW|5.0|this is an absolutely amazing album. the material for all of the songs whether the instrumental, the lyrics or all of the emotion each member puts into his work-- is what makes this album one of the legends of legendary alternative music. this album is best for those first getting into weezer. the songs are fun and catchy but also reveal more of the emotional side of weezer that isn't shown as obviously in their later albums. although pinkerton is my personal favorite weezer cd, blue is better in different ways. blue is the cd that makes weezer fans weezer fans but pinkerton is the cd that keeps weezer fans weezer fans. this is really a phenomenal cd, and i really don't say that often. for the people who are just getting into weezer, this is the cd you MUST buy first and for those wondrous people who have already discovered the benefits of weezer-blue is a must-have in your collection!!
B00006L9ZT|1.0|This set of Ring cycle dvd is a downright disappointment. Although the Met orchestra performs well enough, Levine's interpretation is stodgy and uninspiring. Unfortunately, the singing is worse, the chief offender being Hildegard Behrens worn Brunnhilde - she shouldn't have taken the role in the first place. Most of the other singers are either below their best, past their prime, or totally miscast. I won't recommend this to anyone.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|0k well, I personally don't have much interest in Katie Holmes' films except maybe Pieces Of April, but that's besides the point. First Daughter is great! <br /> <br />It's about Samantha McKenzie, the daughter of the President of the United States. Well, she wants a normal college experience, so she goes off to college, except nobody is interested in her because she has security following her everywhere! Tabloids and posted in the halls, girls make fun of her, but one boy has interest. She finds love at the end, and that every experience is a great one. <br />
6305181772|4.0|This is a picture that pitifully, promises much more than what it gives. At the end, when you sum, you feel something didn't fit, despite the frenetic narrative rhythm.<br />Visually the film is stunning, plenty of action, but the script is extremely weak, the dominant presence of Cruise along the film, shadows the ominous presence of figures as Jon Voight, Scott Thomas, Jean Reno and Vanessa Redgrave who are pitifully wasted in insipid lines.<br />To win in a thriller you have to think in the evilness of the characters too. It is not enough to shine with bit nails sequences. I mean; there is a balance problem in the dramatic environment. And the presence of the enemy is so diminished that it is reduced to a simple cartoon.<br />The final sequence crossed the line of the credibility to convert itself in a funny joke.<br />That's what it happens when you loss the dramatic equilibrium and the abuse of the special effects domains the balance.
B00007BKVC|4.0|This film is not so much a Chick Flick as much as it is an adventure film about waking up and finding yourself. Some see it as an anti-man movie, but I always thought it was more about women taking their life back and taking control of their own destiny. Most of all it's about women not being defined by men.<br />Early on Louise is the strong charcter and Thelma seems to be the weak one, but by the end they have both grown into someone who had been hiding inside all along.<br />Louise lets down her guard and comes to terms with her past and Thelma becomes the strong, independant women she never knew she was.<br />Two ordinary Southern women become outlaw-hero's in a matter of days.<br />It's a high-speed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you watch it.<br />In the end they take back their life, no matter how many HATED the ending.

And in this sense, the film whether or not it's a clear warning, far beyond ideological status and politic beliefs. Our convoluted and contaminated Earth is our unique space navy, It is good to remember it.<br /><br />Spectacular special effects make this film a must see.
0671027387|4.0|Although there are some highly-incredible moments in the book, such as a submarine picking up a tap-tap-tap signal in the middle of the Arctic, and there is a question of whether all the science is actually science or pseudo-science, that didn't matter. The book was an excellent read, and there was enough logic and action in it to keep one's interest, and to keep one turning the pages.  I thought that it was a much better read than the iconoclastic Da Vinci Code and it's formulaic Angels & Demons.  This book has a beginning, middle and end that was complete, and satisfying, something missing from these other two books.

So despite all the carping by the Greil Marcus, Robert Christgau, et al \\"wannabees\\", buy the record. You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />
0679736646|5.0|I have just withdrawn my earlier review for this novel because Amazon does not like the same item to be reviewed by one reviewer more than once. But I have just reread this novel and the light of my life experience has exposed so much more in it. Philip Dick is my absolute favourite writer - ahead of such others as Ivan Turgenev, Joseph Conrad, WH Hudson, Anna Kavan, Mary Shelley.... Not only is it his mind-bending plot lines, his dead pan humour, his gruelling descriptions of disaster (almost minimalist but enormously effective) but also his research - philosophy, theology, psychology. When I read 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' he taught me all about empathy.<br /><br />This novel is about a psychopath - hidden until the very end, but impacting everywhere. There is a remedy for the disastrous personal collapses the psychopath triggers and how I wish I had just such a remedy for a colleague of mine! Not for me, but for her and all those who work and live around her. I suffered a recent bout of bullying in the workplace which alerted me to the fact that this bully might be something much worse and his impact in our community of workers may be much wider than just against me.<br /><br />By chance a television program alerted me to a book, just published, called 'Working with Monster' by John Clarke and published by Random House Australia. Reading Clarke's book - not only about the workplace psychopath but also about his or her victims - has shown me how well Philip Dick plotted these characteristics into his novel. There was, for me, another inexplicable link between my workplace candidate psychopath (I cannot diagnose it - I am not a professional in these matters) and 'Ubik' - so spooky as to suggest to me that there are messages for me in this - but from where?<br /><br />'Ubik'is a great novel, and its foundations are very sound. Read it and laugh at Joe Chip's fight with the autonomous doors and other devices, be fascinated at the wonderful pen picture of Wendy Wright, be horrified at Joe Chip's stagger up the stairs under the unsympathetic eyes of Pat Conley, follow the speculations of the characters in this thriller that takes you back from the future of 1990 (as it was imagined by Philip Dick in 1969) all the way back to 1939.<br /><br />My heading to this review is the question posed by so many psychopath's victims - and it is a quote from 'Ubik'.<br /><br />What did I write in the earlier review?<br /><br />*********************<br />After scanning some reviews of 'Ubik' I was appalled. There are people who believe Philip K Dick couldn't write, couldn't plot a story!!!! Now I don't claim to be a technical purist in these matters but I can certainly tell great writing when I read it. Here are two things to look out for in 'Ubik'. Firstly there is a character description of Wendy Wright that starts 'As always, when the opportunity arose, Joe took a long astute look at the girl whom, if he could have managed it, he would have had as his mistress, or even better, his wife.' and ends with '...... She had too much control over herself and outside reality for that.' And then there is the chilling collapse of Joe Chip at the start of Chapter 13, watched by an apparently unsympathetic Pat Conley.<br />I recommend those who have not yet experienced 'Ubik' to read it with an open mind and a preparedness to let the plot take you for a ride - whatever you do, don't try to make your 'solution' to the twists and turns as they unfold THE only possible resolution. Philip Dick will almost certainly take you another direction.<br /><br />******************************<br /><br />other recommended reading:<br />John Clarke - Working with Monsters<br />Philip Dick - A Maze of Death<br />Philip Dick - A Scanner Darkly<br />Philip Dick - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?ied at Joe Chip's stagger up the stairs under the unsympathetic eyes of Pat Conley, follow the speculations of the characters in this thriller that takes you back from the future of 1990 (as it was imagined by Philip Dick in 1969) all the way back to 1939.

The lyrics are so frank and straight forward that it makes an album full of politics an album full of fun... <br />I think it is so neat how Green Day pulled it all together after so many trashy albums and released a totally freaky American Idiot. <br />this is a total must in your collection and you will instantly be taken under by the trios super vocals guitar and lyrics.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|I was really trying to understand why this film seemed to appeal to some people, (outside of all the bogus reviews written here by obvious plants from the industry) and have concluded that it is a film loved by anglophiles and wannabe upper class ladder climbers. Why else could such a totally boring film be considered a good film? It is not the writing, as it is pure boring drivel. It is not the content, as it is boring as well. It is not the acting, because all the actors are as inspired as concrete. The fascination with this movie lies in the typical neurotic/psycosis of middle white america and the dreams of these people returning to a period of time where there were no \\"problems\\" living with other races and other classes. The setting of the movie is sterile with not a colored face to be found. Truly, the only problem that the main character has is his abnormal interest in a married woman's children. This is, in a nutshell, what this movie is about. <br /> <br />The critics rave and the duped film going audience is fooled into thinking that this movie is stellar. Glowing empty headed reviews reveal the inability of these movie goers to understand that the movie is bad; the attraction being that they are drawn to their inner desires to be in a period of time where they can be free of the raging \\"common\\" masses. This is why they praise and enjoy this movie. This movie is a sham in everyway, and the glowing reviews only are a bald faced attempt to sell a very boring movie. I cannot fanthom the utter depravity and sheer dumbness and braindead premise of this film. The only saving grace to \\"Finding Neverland\\" is that it shows that the movie going public has proven that it is not smart enough to understand that they have been fooled into accepting such a piece of trash as \\"good film making.\\" This is good news because this means that any of us can make movies such as Finding Neverland and get rich. <br /> <br />This is the worse movie made in recent film history. If youdoubt this, go ahead, make my day and watch it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B00008H2LB|4.0|after Hybrid Theory we all expected another jamming session but things have really changed... this can't quite be called a 'growing up album' but the lyrics are a little older and the music is way different from HT but still better in it's own way. <br />I think the lyrics are a little too much the same and boring(no way hot raps about things no one understands) but Linkin Park has done it again and produced a great album that should be on your list to buy (unless you want something else) thank goodness the guys haven't split yet, though, cuz chester would probably be the first to get creamed...but his vocals are amazing
B000002UAF|5.0|This was the soundtrack music for the Beatles first film.  It caused quite a stir at the time because they were just reaching the height of Beatlemania and the albums was packed with great tunes.  I love the moody Things We Said Today best, but the Title Track is followed by I Should Have Know Better, If I Fell, I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, Can't Buy Me Love, Any Time At All, I'LL Cry Instead, When I Get Home, You Can't Do That and I'll Be Back.  Enough said?  WOW!<br /><br />This was the Beatles when the \\"fun\\" was still in the fav four, when the business was still all play and happiness and the songs reflect that.  So if you are updating your music library this one is a MUST.

B000002UJQ|5.0|A friend of mine lent me this album a while ago, but I sadly did not listen to it much. I did not like the idea of listening to modern music, for I am a classic rock enthusiast and guitarist. Recently, however, I had heard many good things about this album, and saw that it was selected by Spin magazine as the best album in the past twenty years. I figured it was time for a second attempt.  <br /> <br />I listened to this album just the other night for the first time while laying in bed half asleep, and its brilliance kept me from drifting off. Every track is really touching in some way. Even \\"Fitter Happier,\\" with its cold computer voice spewing propaganda, manages to arouse feelings of labeling dehumanization. \\"No Surprises\\" really touched me like no other song I've ever heard. For some reason, I felt emotionally connected to it. Then Yesterday I realized that it was played at the end of L'auberge Espagnole. It had that emotional end-of-movie charm attached to it in my memory, and I didn't even realize. It's still a wonderful song and I think I would like to fall in love to it. <br /> <br />This album is perfectly themed and toned. Some say The Bends is a better album to start with concerning Radiohead, and other say it takes a few listens to appreciate, but I started with OK Computer and loved it instantly. Like Dark Side of the Moon, it is a must-hear album.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Tired and mediocre Keanu Reeves horror movie is not only his worse performance in a film but it's probably one of the most unoriginal horror movies ever made. It not only rips off a much better horror movie of yesterday (The Prophecy) but it also does it pretty badly with a script that is very poorly written and pretty bad special effects that are not up to the standards that we are all accustom to (The best of these scenes are in the trailer). I agree with the majority of the views express here that Rachel Weisz does transcend this horrible film with her fine and powerful performance but she's really alone in this film in terms of the finer points that this film really had. She is so good in this film that you actually want to like this movie because of her great and game performance but with a dumb and poorly written script and a bad performance by Keanu Reeves, you actually feel sorry for her for being in this film instead.  <br /> <br />1 star and that is for Rachel Weisz's better than this movie really deserved performance.  <br />
B000053VAZ|2.0|Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film.  Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a \\"housemate\\" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother.  Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality.  Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp.  The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own.  While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|El pasado fin de semana fui a una actividad de la comunidad en el parque de Riverview en Melbourne, Florida, donde celebraban dieciseis anos del dia de la union racial (Racial Unity Day). En esa actividad participo un pequeno grupo colombiano bailando y cantando canciones folkloricas de su pais. En ese momento me resulto curioso saber que mi nueva asignacion, para el periodico local EL PLAYERO, seria escribir sobre la artista actual mas renombrada, talentosa y alumbrada de Columbia, SHAKIRA.<br /><br />Shakira la joven cantante, autora y productora nacida y criada en Baranquilla, Colombia, de padres de Lebanon y Colombia, acaba de lanzar un nuevo disco compacto en espanol, Fijacion Oral 1. Oral Fixation 2 sera su siguiente album discografico con temas en ingles que saldra a la venta en noviembre de este ano.<br /><br />El martes, 7 de junio, se lanzo el primer album, Fijacion Oral 1, el cual ya a roto records de venta mundialmente. El titulo del disco se refiere a la etapa de la vida en la cual el ser humano tiene mas fijacion oral. Esa es la primera face que es la mas elemental, instinctiva y primitiva. Shakira dice que se considera estar en esa etapa  ya que todavia esta en contacto con los aspectos mas animalisticos de su ser.<br /><br />Fijacion Oral-Volumen 1 consiste de diez canciones eclecticas escritas y producidas por Shakira. Algunos de sus colaboraciones son con el argentino Gustavo Cerati, que fue el solista de la banda de rock Soda Stereo, y el espanol Alejandro Sanz. Cerati canta dos temas con ella, `No' conteniendo buen sonido de guitara acustica y `Dia Especial'.<br /><br />Alejandro Sanz interpreta un duo con Shakira que ha sido un super exito. Ese es, por supuesto, `La Tortura'. La combinacion de sus voces es esquisita. La letra es directa y poetica ademas de expresiva, emotiva y seductora. La cancion es una combinacion de musica pop, flamenco, arabe y colombiana con influencia de reggaeton. `La Tortura' es basicamente un dialogo entre un hombre y una mujer y la pregunta obvia es quien tortura a quien?<br /><br />Algunas de mis canciones predilectas son las dos versiones de `La Pared' que contiene fraces fragiles y penosas. Una de las versiones es echa con sonido electronico y la otra mas intima con piano acustico. `Obtener un Si' tiene influencia de bossanova y jazz. `Dia de Enero' es una balada romantica y `Escondite Ingles' tiene un sonido punk rock. Lo mas interesante de estas grabaciones son las seleciones eclecticas y el uso de la poesia ademas de la musica del acordion. Me encanta como usa palabras artisticamente para expresar sentimientos y emociones.<br /><br />Tengo engravada en mi mente las lineas de la cancion `La Pared' que dice, \\"Despues de ti la pared. No me faltes nunca. Debajo el asfalto y mas abajo estar&iacute;a yo. Sin ti.\\" Y del coro de `La Tortura', \\"Ay amor me duele tanto. Me duele tanto. Que te fueras sin decir a donde. Ay amor, fue una tortura perderte.\\"<br /><br />Ademas de tener canciones excitantes y poeticas, el CD contiene un DVD del video `La Tortura' que es bien picante y sensual. Ah&iacute; vemos y sentimos la tortura. El DVD tambien incluye las letras de las canciones y dos cortos documentales. Uno es una entrevista divertida hecha por Alejandro Sanz que me resulto muy relajada, divertida y intima. El otro documental nos demuestra el aspecto creativo de Shakira haciendo sus grabaciones en su estudio de grabaciones en las Bahamas.<br /><br />Shakira es una mujer joven, inteligente, exitosa y exitante ademas de talentosa. Tengo mucha curiosidad de oir su proxima creacion o la continuacion de su Fijacion Oral 1 osea Oral Fixation 2 en noviembre. Sera esa mi tortura? Esperara hasta noviembre? Ay, me duele tanto, me duele tanto.

0792846443|5.0|MISERY is one of the best Stephen King adaptations captured on film.  Under the assured direction of Rob Reiner, the movie presents a chilling study of an obsessive...and deranged...fan.  Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her impeccable portrayal of Annie Wilkes, author Paul Sheldon's \\"number one fan.\\"  She rescues him after he has an accident in a fierce blizzard and nurses him back to health (she's an ex-nurse).  All goes well until Bates discovers that Sheldon has killed off her favorite character, the titular MISERY, and she goes bonkers and forces him to bring the character back.  While Bates is certainly riveting, James Caan is remarkable as well in his role as the victimized author.  It's a shame Oscar overlooked him for this role, as he is just as good as Ms. Bates, and gives a commanding performance.  Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen are quite good in their small roles as well.  MISERY is a suspenseful and witty thriller, and stands as one of King's best.
6305603847|4.0|As an album \\"The Wall\\" is below par for a Pink Floyd album. Get \\"Animals\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" instead. However with this film along side it, it becomes much better in my opinion. The visualisations are appropriate without being intrusive to the music and the animation is in places breathtaking. In short, this is like \\"Fantasia\\" except good. Deffinatly worth a watch if you are a Pink Floyd fan.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Instead of sitting through Titanic, I could have done something productive like watch grass grow, watch paint dry, or just sit in a pitch black room and stare at the wall. The plot drags, much of the acting is terrible, and before it even begins...WE ALL KNOW HOW IT ENDS! There are still people who are surprised! What did they expect? The ship hits the iceberg, then magically sprouts wings and flies away? Of course it sinks...of course DiCaprio dies. In fact, that and Kate Winslet's artistic nudity are the only two things that make this drivel even remotely watchable.<br /><br />If no stars was an option, I'd click it.
B00007E8V4|2.0|This album is a dissapointment for me and many other system of a down fans I know. This c.d. has some good songs like \\"Inner Visons\\" and \\"Boom\\", but most of the other songs just sound like they ran out of scraps for the c.d. I will say it is about the same as their first self titled album, but it isn't even close to the previous \\"Toxicity\\" or it's predecessor \\"Mezmerize\\". When this c.d. first came out I thought it would be S.O.A.D's last c.d. and that they had reached the end of their career. This wouldn't be a good c.d. to let someone listen to who has never heard S.O.A.D. before.this is mainly just something for true S.O.A.D. fans. If you were going to introduce somebody to S.O.A.D., use \\"Toxicity\\"or \\"Mezmerize\\".
630460288X|4.0|Sylvester Stallone has been in some really bad movies; most notably Cobra and, of course, Rhinestone.   In 1993, Stallone made a breakthrough, a breakthrough meaning that he made movies that people didn't walk out on! First off that year, he made Cliffhanger, which was a big domestic and worldwide box office success, and then he followed that with Demolition Man, which was his best breakthrough movie since...well, Cliffhanger.     The movie mixes the usual action with humor. Sandra Bullock cuteness and Wesley Snipes' whacky hairdo and funny oneliners makes this movie watchable. Stallone plays bad-boy cop John Spartan who is frozen in time for irresponsibly taking the lives of innocent people after a bust to catch bad guy Simon Phoenix, played by Snipes, who is caught and put in an ice cube also. 36 years later, the world is a much safer place. Crime is at a rate of zero and people are well-behaved. What happens next? Simon Phoenix escapes from his prison and he is out in search of destruction and since there are no equally demented cops to catch this sort of criminal, they release Spartan to pursue him. And the fun begins! Bullock plays the role of a 90's obsessed cop who becomes Stallone's partner. Her quotes are the funniest in the entire film. ... The movie also features funny cameos by Denis Leary and Rob Schneider.     Despite the movie being a mixture of action and comedy and not solely comedy, this is one of Stallone's funniest roles to date.     The DVD features only include the trailer and shot-by-shot commentary by the film's director Marco Brambilla. But for the movie's sake, this DVD is worth keeping!     Recommended    B
B000021YQV|4.0|This album was the best thing ever to happen to S.O.A.D. It has the best S.O.A.D. song's made to date(even better than some songs on \\"Mezmerize\\"). This is what put them on the map. A lot of people probably didn't know who S.O.A.D. before this album. Toxicity is by far their best work yet, with songs like \\"Chop Suey\\", \\"Toxicity\\",\\"Deer Dance\\", and \\"Arials\\" all becoming names of songs that even MTV watchers would recognize. I believe even \\"Mezmerize\\" may not even be able to top this one.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I am not a fan of Andrew LLoyd Webber.  I find his musicals to be self referential and repetitive.  I never heard or saw any of the three principal leads before.  I didn't see the movie in the theater. I saw Phantom on stage many years ago and was not impressed.  That being said, I rented the film last week and cannot stop watching it!!  I'm obsessed!! <br /> <br />Andrew LLoyd Webber's music is not any better.  The libretto needs vast improvement.  What is better and improved is the extremely sexy and soul-stirring Phantom, Girard Butler.  He is too sexy to be the loathsome, horrifying phantom.  Nothing like Lon Chaney or Herbert Lom.  Clearly miscast.  While Emmy Rossum has a spectaular voice and an ethereal beauty, she lacks real emotion in the part.  I could not read what she was thinking or feeling because all her expressions were similar. <br /> <br />Nonetheless,I am hooked.  If given the choice whether to go with Raoul or stay with the Phantom, I would stay. Christine should have chosen better. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!!
B000007T1M|2.0|This is not the best album I've heard in my life, but it's not S.O.A.D's worst album.(much better than the scraps on \\"Steal This Album\\") The upside is that it is easily recognized by S.O.A.D.'s style. Ithink that it was cool that this was the first band that successfully pulled of this style without sounding terrible. This album really shows how much System improves by the time they make \\"Toxicity\\". I think this album, like \\"Steal This Album\\", is mainly for people who are already fans of S.O.A.D, not a c.d. that you would let someone who has never heard of them listen to.
B000660UN0|5.0|The weakest thing about Clapton's performances as a blues musician has always been his voice.  It's never been painful to hear, but it's definitely an Englishman's voice.  It made From the Cradle hard to enjoy - not because Clapton couldn't deliver the song, but because he sounded like it was work. <br /> <br />This recording has Clapton's best and most relaxed singing, ever.  Better than Behind the Sun, Journeyman or any of his studio recordings, a year of playing these songs since the Me and Mr. Johnson has done wonders for his pitch, phrasing and clarity of tone as a singer.  You already know how well he plays the guitar, and you already know he has the best damn band money can buy.  He positively swaggers through \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" and \\"Stop Breaking Down,\\" and revisits \\"Ramblin' on my Mind\\" for the third time on record [first on Bluesbreakers and thereafter on Just One Night] to deliver his best rendition. <br /> <br />Also, all you self-impressed reviewers who think that this isn't sad enough to be the blues - GET OVER YOURSELVES.  The blues derives from the emotional experience of being black and poor, taking life's pleasures and pains in America.  Eric Clapton gives ample tribute to the more solemn, stripped-down feeling of the original Robert Johnson recordings in his duets with Doyle Bramhall, but then he turns around and rocks the house as Buddy Guy or Muddy Waters might have in the Fifties - when his idols were playing the songs of their idol Robert Johnson. <br /> <br />This isn't the only blues album anyone should own, and Eric Clapton's not the end of the blues.  But this album's a great place to hear these songs for the first time.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|The've done it again. S.O.A.D. has once again brought out a great album that rivals \\"Toxicity\\" as being their best album. One of the best things about this album, is that no two songs sound anything alike. This album truly shows that all their hard work paid off. Once again, i am hearing system of a down song on the radio again, which is awesome and a lot better than stations playing bands like simple plan or papa roach. B.Y.O.B., Cigaro, and Sad Statue have already been released out as singles on the radio, which are good songs for people who have never heard S.O.A.D. to listen to. I think this marks a new high point in their career. I just hope their next album coming out later this year will not be a failure like \\"Steal This Album\\" was.
B0002IU988|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I was a Creed fan, but its amazing to think what they could have done with a better, more talented vocalist. Myles Kennedy brings that to Alter Bridge. The intense passion in his voice is unbelievable, and thats something Scott never could give the band. I just can't believe that Myles Kennedy wasn't already big time before this. Scott Stapp wrote awesome lyrics that would just keep playing over and over in your head. The main difference besides the vocals on this cd is Mark Tremonti. He took his guitar playing to another level on this cd. Some of his guitar solos on the cd leave you in awe. My personal favorite one is the rip on \\"Open your Eyes.\\" <br /> <br />Best songs- Open Your Eyes, Broken Wings, In Loving Memory, Down to My Last, Shed My Skin <br /> <br />This is probably my favorite cd that I own, and whats great about the cd is that even if you listen to it over and over, which i do, the songs don't get old. They are always fresh every time you listen to them.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|After having seen this movie starring my favorite actor, Gerard Butler, I am now a true-blue Phanatic of the PHantom.  His love for Christine and the pain he has been made to endure, by God and by Man, makes him a figure that millions can identify with.Gerard Butler has brought this mysterious Man-Angel of Music to the masses, giving the story a wider berth of empathy, understanding and acceptance.  I thank Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber as well for their cinematic vision.  They have created a \\"new deep emotional center\\" for the Phantom.This is a beautiful movie with a beautiful and talented cast.  Emmy Rossum is divine, catapulting one so young to true stardom.  I cannot say enough about Gerard Butler.  I loved his voice.  He is so multi-talented; to me he is like the next Richard Burton.  GB is truly mastering his thespian-hood.  Not only is he captivating as Erik, he humanizes him as no other actor has done before on film or stage.  He is adored world-wide for this role.GREAT MUSICAL!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I was slightly disappointed the first time I saw this film - probably because I was so hyped up about it, having heard so many people talk about how hilarious it was.  My second time through it, though, everything clicked.  Team America: World Police is juvenile and disgusting, yet sharply pointed satire that goes out of its way to be offensive - in other words, it's hilarious, and yet more proof of Trey Parker's genius.  Parker and Stone do things no one else would ever dream of doing - or even be allowed to do.  It's a film I know I know I will enjoy watching time and time again for years to come.<br /><br />Hilarity aside, the audacity of making such an elaborate film using puppets is almost mind-boggling.  Parker and Stone probably had little idea of what they were getting into, yet they stayed the course, brought together a tremendous team of individuals who, as the special features make obvious, relished the chance to take the art of puppetry to new heights, and created something that is really quite amazing.  It's uncanny how life-like these puppets are - I daresay Alec Baldwin, for example, is much more wooden in real life than is his puppet in this film.  These aren't just wooden characters dangling on strings; each puppet's head is filled with animatronics that control his/her expressions with uncanny precision.  The puppet fights are hilarious, but nothing's funnier than watching Gary give \\"the signal\\" as his first mission with the elite American fighting force goes south.<br /><br />As with everything Parker and Stone do, there's actually a point behind all of the humor.  Though their detractors would never admit it, these guys actually do have a handle on what is going on in the world - and within America.  If you've ever seen South Park, you know how quickly they manage to exploit the big issues of the day.  No one is safe from these guys' political humor, but the Left does tend to suffer the brunt of the satirical attack in this film.  (Those who say Parker and Stone are suddenly outright conservatives have obviously forgotten their short-lived series That's My Bush - which was the only unfunny thing they've ever done.)  Team America itself takes America's military might to obvious extremes, as when they pretty much destroy Paris in order to stop WMD-toting terrorists (of course, no one seems to consider the fact that the terrorists would have destroyed Paris to an even greater extent themselves had their plan succeeded).  Alec Baldwin's ilk, though, suffers most because they have two Stone/Parker targets on their back.  One, they are soporific liberals who would stop terrorism by sympathizing with the enemy and commiserating with their extreme anti-American views over tea and crumpets; two, they are actors and I think Parker and Stone really mean it when they say they hate actors - it's one of the reasons they chose to make this movie with puppets (plus, one of the original inspirations for the project was the idea of doing a parody of today's action films).<br /><br />I don't think I need to describe the movie, really.  Kim Jong-Il (even though he does sound a little too much like Eric Cartman, at times) is a great character, of course, but you probably know all about the film's story by now.  It is true that Parker and Stone push the envelope (actually, they just tear it all apart and rush right on past it) at times - especially in the puppet love scene and the vomiting scene - probably just to prove how much they can get away with, but you just have to expect that sort of thing from these guys.  It's one of the things that makes them Parker and Stone.  Let's not forget the songs, either.  From the heart-pumping theme song to Kim Jung-Il's loneliness lament, Team America World Police features a great soundtrack (be sure to go all the way through the final credits in order to hear a final little snippet from Kim Jung-Il).<br /><br />If you're easily offended, you'll probably be holding your nose higher and higher as you watch this film (even while those around you are bent over holding their stomachs with laughter) - but that's okay because the rest of us need someone to hold our popcorn while we struggle to regain our breath.her as you watch this film (even while those around you are bent over holding their stomachs with laughter) - but that's okay because the rest of us need someone to hold our popcorn while we struggle to regain our breath.
B000007T2Z|5.0|Sigur Rs has been described as the music God listens to. I'm entirely in agreement with that, but I'm sure it's referring only to the version of God in the New Testament, the forgiving one. Godspeed You! Black Emperor is what the terrifying, destruction-dealing Old Testament God listens to. And I'm willing to bet His preferred album is F#A#(oo), in which GY!BE have penned their most powerful and evocative music to date. <br /> <br />From the opening apocalyptic monologue intoned over a forboding bass drone in the Dead Flag Blues to the pounding madness of East Hastings up to the last surreal strains of Providence, GY!BE craft sounds so vibrantly original they almost seem alien. There has never been any group quite like Godspeed and there most likely never will be again. Get this album.
B00005JNJT|4.0|I heard such conflicting reports going into \\"Batman Begins\\" I really didn't know what to expect, but now that I've seen it I know how I feel: I like it. A lot. It's the best Batman to date (and I mean that in a dinner-and-a-movie kind of way).<br /><br />As you doubtless know pretty much everything we've seen from the Batman movies has been tossed out the window and this perhaps most powerful of comic book legends has been stripped to its core to tell the origins of the Dark Knight. Christian Bale takes over for George Clooney (!) as Bruce Wayne, drunken billionaire by day and terrifying avenger by night. I wouldn't dream of ruining the plot for those who have yet to see it, but I think it's safe to say that director/revisionary Christopher Nolan does a topnotch job reworking this story we've all heard a thousand times until it feels like something new.<br /><br />Not the least of his achievements is the cast, which boasts Bale at his best, Michael Caine as a kind and dignified Alfred, Gary Oldman as pre-Commissioner Gordon, and the always welcome Morgan Freeman doing a new twist on Lucius Fox. The real standout here, though, is Irish actor Cillian Murphy, playing Dr. Jonathan Crane, also known as The Scarecrow. I don't know if it's the cerulean eyes, the slightly off, I'm-hiding-my-natural-accent cadence, or the burlap sack, but he is absolutely riveting. (Although I doubt Nolan intended The Scarecrow to be hotter than Batman.)<br /><br />My problems with the movie are relatively few; I think it got a bit bogged down in the second-to-last half hour, and the resolution of Bruce's kinda relationship with the Assistant D.A. was lame. Katie Holmes has been getting smacked around for her performance, but I don't think it was so much her fault as it was the underwritten role. Had the best-friend aspect of her character been better written the whole movie would have gotten a lift.<br /><br />Still these are minor problems and Warner Brothers deserves a pat on the back for trusting their old war-horse to Nolan, who seems a little bit crazy. Then again, after \\"Batman and Robin\\", there was nothing left to lose.<br /><br />GRADE: B+/A-to Nolan, who seems a little bit crazy. Then again, after \\"Batman and Robin\\", there was nothing left to lose.    GRADE: B+/A-
B000957O7S|4.0|What woman could resist Kevin James?  He's cute, adorable, and oh, yeah--funny.  And of course, Will Smith played Will Smith.  I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and this one had me at the q-tip dance.  And though this film does just about everything right, I found myself frustrated with the end.  To me, it just seemed like they couldn't decide between three different endings so they decided to put them all in there.  She comes to apologize...he says no.  Then later, he comes to apologize, she says no.  Then he has this long shakespearian soliloquy after being toss off the roof of a car that was so saccharin sweet I developed a cavity just watching it.  Still it was a good movie.

B00005YXZH|5.0|\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" was my first true introduction to Wilco, and I approached the band from the standpoint of an indie rock--not an alt-country--fan. I mention this right up front because I know it colors my feelings about \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,\\" and even though I have since fallen in love with Wilco's previous albums (as well as other alt-country bands), all of Wilco's prior work seems like steps towards an ultimate goal: \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\\" <br /> <br />From the beginning, \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" sets itself apart from Wilco's past albums--and from most other albums, period. The beautiful noise that introduces \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" clearly has Jim O'Rourke's fingerprints all over it, and the album is better for O'Rourke's influence. Of course, the main innovative force at work is the band itself. Beyond the experiments with noise and music, Tweedy's lyrics have evolved as well. Tweedy's phrasing frequently sends shivers down my spine. Take, for example, this verse from \\"Ashes of American Flags:\\" <br /> <br />\\"I want a good life <br />With a nose for things <br />A fresh wind and bright sky  <br />To enjoy my suffering.\\" <br /> <br />And on paper, this line has only a fraction of the impact that Tweedy's beautiful, delicate and cracking, yet strong and emotion-laden voice provides all of his lyrics. <br /> <br />The songs flow quite seamlessly into one another, even though there are several changes of tone, from the quiet drift of \\"Radio Cure\\" to the upbeat pop-rock of \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" to the soaring journey of \\"Poor Places.\\" I find \\"Ashes of American Flags\\"--a beautifully introspective and searching song--and \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" to be the strongest songs on the album; the power of \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" is certainly augmented by world events that occurred after it was written. I don't think there are any true weak points on this album. I very rarely play \\"Kamera,\\" \\"War on War,\\" or \\"Reservations\\" by themselves, but at the same time, I have no desire to skipover them when I'm listening to the entire album.  <br /> <br />In short, \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is an amazing album both for its innovation and for the sheer beauty of its songs. I would recommend it without reservation to any Wilco or indie rock fan; alt-country fans who are looking for an introduction to Wilco might wish try an earlier album first.
B00001OH7P|5.0|If you just want one david bowie album or if you have a collection, you must have this cd. It was his second hit (after Hunky Dory, 1971) and made him a star through his invented alter ego, ziggy stardust (an androgynous alien come to earth to save rock n roll). Back in 72, he was a very ambitious guy, so when he heard from his friend, Marc Bolan of T Rex, that glam rock was doing well in america, he got to work.  <br /> <br />This album is probably one of his most unique ones (well, besides scary monsters, which is just very strange). All of the tracks have something different to them. My favorites are the first four, which are the soft and slow ones, and seven through ten, which are more upbeat and pure rock. As for rock n roll suicide, you would be better off getting the live version from ziggy stardust the motion picture, because (being the last ziggy performance) they took it up a notch and added some really nice backing vocals and you can hear how bowie is giving it his all. It's still a masterpiece of a song though. Overall, this is an album i can listen to all the way through--there isn't a flawed track on the cd. It was something so new at the time and it still delivers each time i listen to it. <br /> <br />\\"Just call me Ziggy.\\" -David Bowie, 1972
B0002858YS|4.0|The first time I heard \\"Hot Fuss,\\" I must admit I was more than a little scared to hear such blatant '80s influences--the 1980s was not exactly  my favorite era in music. After a few listens, however, I realized that The Killers were smart enough to take inspiration from only the best '80s New Wave bands, and keep these New Wave touches light enough to augment--not overpower--their own sound. \\"Hot Fuss\\" turned out to be one of the most exciting albums I'd heard all year. <br /> <br />True, I wouldn't call \\"Hot Fuss\\" a lyrical masterpiece, but what the album lacks in lyrical power, it more than makes up for in catchiness and pure rock power. The first single, \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" showcases this perfectly; it is a song that slides into your head and almost forces you to dance around. But I don't want to reduce The Killers to mere fluffy enjoyment; there are moments on the album that really hint at the band's possibilities. The Killer's strongest point is their ability to set such a strong mood in practically every song. \\"Andy, You're A Star\\" has an incredibly unique, almost sinister sound, and in \\"All These Things That I've Done,\\" you can sense the pull of change. Indeed, very few albums have made me *feel* the songs to such a degree. <br /> <br />I'd recommend \\"Hot Fuss\\" to most rock fans. If you enjoyed the singles you've heard, there is a good chance you'll enjoy--if not love--this album, since it is fairly consistent throughout. Ultimately, even though \\"Hot Fuss\\" may not be the most innovative or philosophical album of the year, and even though I tend to relentlessly search for deeper meaning, this album reminded me that sometimes it's nice to have fun and enjoy a record on a purely sensory level, and \\"Hot Fuss\\" is the perfect album in that regard.
B00005V331|5.0|Thank you Venom!  Don't dictate to them!  They were the FIRST!  Even today, it's still too loud for the crowd and that's, without saying, a damn good thing! <br />  3 days of recording were enough for the making this album.  I've been a Venom fan for the last 21 years and I ain't getting tired. <br />  Without a care in the world, they wrote and played it the way they wanted and that's part of Venom's charm.  And, by the way, Mantas's solos should finally be recognized for their true value.   <br />  Venom is efficiently injecting it's venom in your veins, gets you to the bone, rips your rib cage off and sucks you dry!  Intense, evil and crazy, Venom is still the band that parents are concerned when they find out their kid is listening to it.  Ladies and Gentlemen, from the very gates of Hell...VENOM!!!

The story begins to unfold when Susie arrives in her version of heaven and keeps watch over her grieving family and friends.<br /><br />Alice Sebold does an amazing job detailing how Susie's death affected everyone around her. Her father, Jack, allows his grief to overcome him, while his wife Abigail seeks comfort in the arms of another man and eventually tries to build a completely new life for herself. Susie's sister Lindsey struggles as she attempts to create an identity for herself that is seperate from \\"the dead girl's sister.\\" Buckley, who is too young to fully understand what happened to his big sister Susie at the time, grows up feeling like he is competing for his father's affections with the memory of a sister he never really knew.<br /><br />Susie's friends also continue to grieve for her. Ray Singh, who was the first and only boy that Susie ever kissed, is never able to let go of the memory of his first love. His friend Ruth, who barely knew Susie in life, forms an uncanny bond with her after her death and eventually manages to give Susie the one thing she wants more than anything else.<br /><br />In the midst of all this grief and coping, there is also the aspect of a serial killer being on the loose. George Harvey was viewed by most as just an eccentric neighbor, but Jack Salmon suspects his involvement in his daughter's death almost from the very beginning. Not everyone else is convinced, however, and as the months following Susie's disappearance turn into years, the reader is left wondering if justice will ever be served and if Mr. Harvey will ever be caught.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" deals with a heartbreaking subject matter. I was hesitant to read this book because it's all about the death of a child, and I generally don't handle that sort of thing very well. However, even though I felt like sobbing with each passing page, it's an absolutely beautiful story about love, loss, life, and death. My review doesn't even begin to do it justice...just go out and buy the damn book! You'll be so glad that you did.well. However, even though I felt like sobbing with each passing page, it's an absolutely beautiful story about love, loss, life, and death.

B00000DOXR|5.0|Ever since The Beatles released their groundbreaking 'White Album', the phenomenon of the double-LP has been an intriguing one. Some of these productions are replete with long-winded instumental performances, such as The Allman Brother's 'Eat a Peach', or the best selling double-live of all time, 'Frampton Comes Alive'. Others represent a true tour de force, such as The Rolling Stones' 'Exile On Main Street', or George Harrisons' 'All Things Must Pass'. Stephen Stills 1972 double-LP, 'Manassas', joins the stellar company of the latter category.  <br /> <br />This masterpiece of composition and performance rests on the diversity of Stills' musical influences. The album is loosely divided into 4 musical genres, yet the opening side, titled 'The Raven', ranges from hard rock to latin rock to powered blues to romantic ballad, and as such nearly defies being categorized. The songs in 'The Raven' are presented as a suite, akin to the opening sides of The Beatles 'Abbey Road', or much of The Who's 'Tommy', and the quality of the music holds its own in comparison with these other, much heralded accomplishments.  <br /> <br />Side two is titled 'The Wilderness', and features a decided country atmosphere. Side three is titled 'Consider', offering a bounty of gentle folk sounds with introspective, intimate lyrics. Side four is titled 'Rock & Roll Is Here To Stay', and as such requires no deep description. As Harrison would say, someone has given Stephen a wah-wah, and he hands it a grueling workout. <br /> <br />Each side of the album contains at least one song which would have to be considered a masterwork. On side one, the plaintive ballad 'Both of Us (Bound To Lose)' does everything but cry for you. On side two, perhaps the most alluring song Stills has ever recorded, 'So Begins the Task', finds center stage. The soft melencholy strains of the acoustic and steel guitars, and the tear-laden lyrics of this song course through the air like the wings of an angel. Side three opens with another plaintive folk song, originally written by Rick Roberts and Chris Hillman, but seriously overhauled by Stills, 'It Doesn't Matter'. And side four features the epic rock song, 'The Treasure'. <br /> <br />Interspersed are numbers representing the best Stills has ever produced in any vernacular. His hard rock leanings are indulged in 'Song of Love', 'Rock & Roll Crazies', 'Anyway', 'What To Do', and 'Right Now'. His blues prowess is delivered in 'Jet Set' and 'Blues Man'. Stills latino influences are given their due on 'Cuban Bluegrass', and he even offers an appealing, pioneering endeavor on the moog synthesizer in 'Move Around'. His acoustic folk skills are displayed on 'Colorado', 'Fallen Eagle', 'Johnny's Garden', 'Jesus Gave Love Away For Free', and 'How Far'. There is virtually no filler on either of these albums.  <br /> <br />Stills supporting cast deserve much acclaim for the opus that is 'Manassas'. Dallas Taylor (drums) and Calvin \\"Fuzzy\\" Samuels (bass) joined Stills in previous ventures with David Crosby and Graham Nash, and offer an able rhythm section. The real standouts backing Stills, however, are Joe Lala laying down a latin-tinged beat through a variety of percussion instruments, and Al Perkins offering scintillating steel guitar solos and background for songs such as 'Hide It So Deep' and 'The Treasure'. Chris Hillman rides along on rhythm guitar, and together with Perkins contributes haromonies that, at times, complement Stills gruff vocal delivery even better than Crosby or Nash ever did. <br /> <br />If there is to be a criticism of this production, it is that the performance of these songs, at times, feels a bit formulaic. Stills is known to be a perfectionist, and in the recording studio this may lead to a stunted feeling that was overcome when the band performed live. In 2000 Pioneer Artists released live studio performances by the band in their genesis. This video, titled 'Live At Musikladen', reveals how much more heartfelt and personal some of these songs can become, especially offerings such as 'It Doesn't Matter', 'Hide It So Deep', and even 'The Treasure'. Clearly, however, the complexity of mixing the stylings of a seven piece band and an occasional fiddler at times requires fiddling around a bit in the studio. <br /> <br />If you enjoy the more visible and commercial work Stills has offered in the past, such as 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' and 'Love the One You're With', do yourself a favor: purchase this CD and savor the true depth and breadth of a modern day troubador. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is a cinematic triumph because it doesn't allow the power of Hollywood glitz, to get in the way of a compelling story that is character based and powerful. Bale is at the heart of that story - giving a portrayal of Batman that is at once - tortured and dark as well as warm and sensitive. The Batman franchise is back and in Bale, they have a powerful leading man.     Bale - a veteran of recent films portraying psychopaths, brings a psychopathic element to Batman : a presence that seems only slightly saner than the criminals he engages.      Bale's Batman has a lot of imperfections, keeping with director Nolan's vision of Bruce Wayne struggling to learn how to be a crimefighter for the first time. The husky whisper is somewhat heavy, admittedly. Batman struggles to hold on when leaping buildings for the first time. Bale feeling the pain of the flames when Dr Crane sets him on fire.     Nolan's portrayal of Gotham City also gives it a dimension that many of us can identify with. He shows us that the biggest threat to Gotham itself isn't supervillains but organised crime that infects and infiltrates all levels of city bureaucracy.     This Batman gives the franchise a soul and a superhero with human frailties both physical and emotional. Nolan and Goyer, along with Bale have succeeded beyond expectations in bringing respect to the franchise again. This is Batman at his darkest, most tortured self. This is the Batman that we have all come to see.
B00001OH7O|5.0|David Bowie is a great musician. His music is intense and beautiful. I love playing Bowie for other people when I'm at work so they will have to listen to it. His music is addicting and fun.<br /><br />Hunky Dory on the other hand is one of his best works especially the song \\"ANDY WARHOL\\", freakin' amazing song! It has some of the best acoustic work I've ever heard. \\"Changes\\" is just plain classic. \\"Oh, You Pretty Things\\" is great. \\"Life on Mars\\" is a brilliant Bowie tune that gets stuck in my head more then most Bowie songs. He sure does love fantasy and space, obviously since he sings about them and starring in Labyrinth (Must see Movie). \\"BEWLAY BROTHERS\\" how could I forget, I love this song, just didn't catch the name untill now.<br /><br />A beautiful Bowie work of art. He is becoming one of my very favorite musical artists.

B00004SA86|5.0|This review is not from 2005, but from July 2nd 2014.<br /><br />This is the most successful and consistent collection of the Mahler symphonies by one single conductor.<br />In this review I will tell a little about my story with this set, give my opinion of each recording and suggest alternative purchases considering interpretation and sound quality. I am no native English speaker, so please forgive my writing errors.<br /><br />Even in his own time, Mahler's instrumentation was generally admired, although his music met little comprehension. Mahler tends to distribute the musical discourse among a lot of voices and individualize instruments in the orchestra. This makes it difficult to record him properly, even today.<br />This set has a good, but not excellent recording sound. One may imagine that state-of-the-art recording sound by default is much, much better. That is not the case, however. Sound quality differs, and sometimes recordings from the 1960ies can compare to modern recordings.<br />Kubelik tends to employ relatively brisk tempos and still keeping an incredible attention to details. This makes for demanding listening experiences. He has a good grasp of the musical architecture, too. But it can feel pretty intense some times!<br /><br />I bought this set as a budget option in 1993. I did not know anything about Kubelik as a Mahler interpreter then and had only one recording of a Mahler symphony, his 4th by Maazel. At a friend in Florence, far from my Oslo, I had listened to recordings of his 5th (by Sinopoli) and his 7th (don't remember which recording, but I adored it). And I had concert experiences with the 4th and the 7th, and knew Bernstein's recording of the 4th (the DGG).<br />About ten years ago I had the money and time to indulge in a Mahler collecting frenzy. It started by adding some other recordings of  my favourite symphony, the 7th. Then I collected about 15 recordings of the 5th, as I had never got warm with the Kubelik. It followed a crazycollecting of the 6th as well, a good deal of the 7th, and many of the 8th, some 9th, some 3rd, and even some more 4th and one single 2nd. I have only three recordings of Das Lied von der Erde, which is one of my favourites among the symphonies, no recording included in this set.<br />I have spent much time comparing the recordings, but probably not enough. Anyway, as all of us are different, I am still not so sure that you will benefit from my judgements. Taste differs! And as taste differs, please take reviews with a grain of salt, including this one, one cannot trust even professional reviews! Objectivity is not the point in art. And never take for granted that if you like one conductor in one Mahler-symphony, you will like him in the next.<br />Not having much time to spend in writing even in my holiday, I'm going to do this as fast as I can. I will only assess the quality of the interpretation/performance/recording, and only go to details when I really can compare. Now to each symphony:<br /><br />The 1st. Mahler's most funny symphony. I don't know many recordings, as I am fully content with the Kubelik here. Some claim his Audite-recording is even better. Better sound, but slower tempos, has Bernstein (the Wienna/DGG).<br /><br />The 2nd. Mahler as preacher and novelist. I don't know many recordings of this one either, as I am fully content with the Kubelik here, too. He is probably the most exciting here. Klemperer is good too, but I prefer Kubelik. Some times I listen to the slow movements by Levi, which sound fantastic, but I find Levi boring in the outer movements.<br /><br />The 3rd. Mahler's natural science-symphony. I have never been discontent with Kubelik here, so I searched only by curiosity, reading lots and lots of reviews, buying some recordings. A good sounding recording and pleasant interpretation is the old Bernstein (New York/Sony). For a while I believed that Chailly was even better than Kubelik, well, he is more catchy in the beginning of each movement, but often losing the spark later in the movement. So that judgement was due to zapping! Kubelik is better when it comes to building up. The reviewer Tony Duggan recommends the modern Bychkov, but I am not particularly impressed by that, although it sounds well. I stick to Kubelik. His Audite-recording is reportedly better than the present recording, but I am not going to spend more money on Mahler.<br /><br />The 4th. A child born from the 3rd symphony, a child pastorale, idyll, but there is a snake in the paradise. I was used to the warm and slow recording by Maazel before getting this Kubelik. One peculiar thing about this: I never listened through the slow Ruhevoll-movement by Maazel. Why? Because it gets boring, of course. But I believed the movement as such was boring, reportedly Mahler was never \\"consistent\\". Well, performed by Kubelik it is certainly not boring. Mahler reportedly calculated the timing of this movement to be about 15 minutes, that was «ruhevoll» (full of quietness) in his opinion. Kubelik takes it at 18'47\\", i.e. much slower than Mahler would, still it is one of the fastest on record and thus closest to Mahler's own timing-estimate on record. The movement is mostly played slower than 20 minutes. Maazel takes it at 22'31\\" − and that is not unusual even today. I guess Mahler never imagined that conductors would be tempted to take his music as slowly as they do in our era of recordings. Slowness makes for impressing sound, brisk tempos make the sound feel more lean.<br /> If you want impressive recording sound, the [[ASIN:B00000JCIP Levi Symphony 4 Songs of a Wayfarer]] is a good choice, although I don't like the mature voice of Frederica von Stade for the childish 4th movement song. Anyway, I sometimes listen to that nice-sounding recording. Sometimes I listen to Ziesak's youthful singing of the last movement, but I don't like the too high ambitions of her conductor, Gatti (overstating everything, I think). If you buy the thirdsymphony by Bernstein (Sony), his fourth (Sony) is a good addition; his soprano, Reri Grist, has at least an innocent voice.<br />Anyway, I think this Kubelik is \\"the best\\" of the recordings I know, and his wife, Elsie Morison is excellent in terms of voice and interpretation. But it has taken years to arrive to this conclusion.<br />Tony Duggan observes that Kubelik's brisk tempos don't imply glossing over details. Please keep that observation in mind for the next symphony:<br /><br />The 5th. Mahler as novelist, creating a story of a man, starting in tragedy but ending in bliss. Perhaps because I had listened to the Sinopoli-recording a few years before, I was not prepared for the way Kubelik handles this symphony. Only to a certain degree I agree with Tony Duggan's assessment, that the sound is to blame for the short-comings of this particular recording.<br />Returning to it, ten years after discarding it, and after experiences with more than 15 other recordings, I am stunned by all the qualities of Kubelik's account.<br />Kubelik was always superb with structure in Mahler, I have never been in doubt about that. Well, listening again is like a shock to me: I am stunned about the quality and attention to details in the recording that I eventually spurned, for reasons I don't understand anymore. For the sound quality, I tested the sound reproduction of the violin in the Tempo 1-part of the funeral march, and lo and behold, it is gloriously captured from 7'44\\" to 7'52\\", as good as I have only experienced with Barbirolli! And the Kubelik-recording has very clear rendering of the contrapuntal lines in all the movements. So I don't even have quibbles anymore about the sound, it is pleasant. Yes, a little more spacious sound ambience, a little more thundering brass, and it would easily be my favourite Mahler 5th, brimming with energy, sunny of course, I always felt it was, and a great sense of structure.<br />The reason for my headache ten years ago was probably due totoo much musical information in too little space. It can get pretty intense sometimes! I was like Madame Verdurin in Proust, who couldn't take Wagner; Kubelik's 5th was too demanding to me as a listener; I could not absorb its riches; it was too much!<br />But it might have been something about the sound ambience too, as I not even liked the relaxed rondo-finale.<br />So I went buying 15 other recordings of this symphony, only to return to it, finding out that after all it is the very best to my ears. The performance has not changed, but I. Mahler is not only about reading, performance, recording & mastering - it is also about the listener. Whoever has ears, let them hear.<br />The sound is surprisingly detailed but not spacious. With more spacious sound it would be the indisputable winner, only that art is no competition.<br /> If you want a recording with nice sound, I recommend the [[ASIN:B00008XS1R Haenchen]]. My review of that recording contains remarks on more than 15 other recordings too, including additional remarks on this one. Very well played and recorded is the [[ASIN:B0033BJSJ2 Barshai]], which many professional reviewers recommend. For my part I disagree with the tempo choices of Barshai, enjoying only the two first movements of that recording. But the sound is clear and yet pleasant. But my recommendation is and remains Haenchen for nice sound, but don't expect the intensity of Kubelik's sexy account.<br /><br />The 6th. Mahler's most classically shaped symphony is very much about struggle. No recording of this symphony has given me more pleasure than just this Kubelik. Yes, Kubelik goes fast, but I think it becomes the symphony. The fast marching rhythm of the 1st movement is not the real speed; the melody that unfolds is much slower than the rhythm accompanying it. I would have no problem with a much slower marching rhythm per se; the problem is that then the melody unfolds painfully slowly!<br /> I do like the almost similarly timed [[ASIN:B000025OPA Solti]] as well as the Kubelik, but the martial Solti doesn't have the same attention to detail as Kubelik, not the same palette of colours, not the same contrasts between conflict and idyll. Solti is more consistently rough, that consistence makes for a more easy listening, in fact.<br /> For really great sound with lots of details, and still possible interpretation, I have to use two alternative recordings: [[ASIN:B000001GBD Bernstein]] for the 1st movement and [[ASIN:B00005Y4NS Gielen]] for the finale. (You see, Bernstein DGG has a painfully slow finale, Gielen has a painfully slow 1st movement. Since both come in two CDs, you have to change CD on your player in any case.) But in the long run you don't lose many details by sticking to the Kubelik. (I have many recordings, even a rare Sanderling, yes, I have wasted a shameful amount of money on my curiosity: Bernstein DDG, Bernstein Sony, Karajan, Maazel, Abbado/Chicago, Abbado/Berlin, Levi, Neeme Järvi, Chailly, Gielen, Tennstedt, Sanderling, Barbirolli, Bertini...) The fast and exciting Neeme Järvi is hurrying over the so-called Alma-theme in beginning of the first movement, the same problem I have with the Levi, sorry folks, but I don't think his Alma theme stands out (is contrasted against the surrounding discorse as good as in Kubelik and many other recordings), and generally I don't get the colours, besides Levi also omits the repetition. Still Levi has spacious, modern sound! So I stick to Solti, Kubelik and for great sound I recommend a combination of BernsteinDDG (for the first movement) and Gielen (for the last movement).<br /><br />The 7th. Mahler's journey to the end of the night, both terrifying and amourous, not like Céline's novel, of course. My absolute favourite symphony, not only of Mahler, but of all symphonies I know − and it was love at first listening, in Oslo Concert House about 25 years ago. I have always been satisfied with the Kubelik-version, but I believed it should be possibleto get more mystery out of it, so I added some other recordings. After a hiatus, I have returned to this Kubelik and it is currently the one I mostly listen to. (I don't think his second Nachtmusik is too fast, and it is much slower than the famous Kondrashin live-performance from 1979 in Amsterdam.) I have the Kubelik Audite-recording too, clearer, but not so warm sound.<br /> A very different recording I like a lot is the  [[ASIN:B000001GNE Abbado/Chicago]] (by all means, not his hazy Berlin), with great sense of mystery, as Tony Duggan observes; I happen to concur with Duggans understanding of this particular symphony. For the greatest sound quality, try the [[ASIN:B00005O7SS Gielen]], but in spite of normal timings, his interpretation is not on par with neither of the two Kubeliks nor the Abbado/Chicago, especially not the rondo finale. The Abbado/Chicago has some hilarious and some very ugly details. Bernstein (Sony) doesn't impress me particularly in this symphony, it is good, of course, but I usually stick to Kubelik, Abbado/Chicago and  − only for the recorded sound − the Gielen. I also do like the legendary Kondrashin.<br /><br />The 8th. Mahler's last blissful vision, great and demanding. This symphony is almost impossible to record decently, due to the multitude of forces involved. Considering interpretation and performance, Kubelik is excellent here.<br /> I also like the Bertini, which arguably sounds a little better. A wonderful interpretation and performance is the Abravanel from 1963, but the sound is somehow not fully satisfying; I don't know why I don't see the same colours. Not even Gielen has fully satisfying sound. For very detailed sound, you could try Wit. The problem is that not only his interpretation, but also his detailed sound is boring. The sound of the Wit-recording: Everything is covered, but nothing stands out and the punch of other recordings is missing. So what can I say? Best sound: a good concert hall.<br /><br />9th. I neverhad any qualms about this Kubelik-recording, but some people claim his Audite is better; it is perhaps more touching even not more dramatic. The problem with the perfect Audite-performance is the sound quality. It is a poor live recording of a concert in Tokyo.<br /> Best audio: probably [[ASIN:B0009I7OG6 Gielen]], which has incredibly great sound, oh, my, oh, my, what a sound! The problem is that Gielen doesn't touch me, only his fabulous sonorities do, and his 2nd movement goes too slowly to my taste. A compromise is the [[ASIN:B000063WRS Abbado/Berlin], with a warm, hazy sound, it captures sonorities quite well. Abbado however, takes the 2nd movement too fast! And although very good on sentimentality, he is missing a little in the drama department. When I am listening to the touching Kubelik/Audite, I am missing the incredibly good sound quality of the Gielen; while listening to the Gielen, I am missing the spiritual reading of Kubelik/Audite. I don't miss very much by the Abbado/Berlin, but I know it is not perfect.<br /><br />Das Lied von der Erde is not included in this box. My love for that work compares even to my love for the 7th. I don't think anybody needs more than Klemperer there. Modern sound, great interpretation and performance is the Bertini. Artistically it compares even to the Klemperer. (Kubelik/Audite is only my 3rd choice there.)

It's a light, comfortable, easy read I would feel good about putting in my child's (teen) room for the summer or taking to the beach for something quick.  However, it was too light for me.  No plot, short, poor dialog, very little depth to the characters.  The author would start to touch on the charm of Africa, then simply abandon it in search of a story that never seemed to take hold. <br />I am pleased to have met the charming main character, however found I could have put the book down at any time without feeling the loss.  I won't be looking to read the rest in series.  This was pleasant....but once is enough.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|\\"It's No game Pt 1\\" starts off this really cool album put out by David Bowie. It's a load of fun and doesn't have a weak song on it. This is one album that really grew on me and now I listen to it more then my other Bowie albums.<br /><br />Don't let the album art scare you away. It actually caught my attention because of my love for art. \\"Fashion\\" has a nice sound to it beat wise which might make you sway your hips a little. \\"Scary Monsters\\" is a very catchy tune. \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" is probably my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />This is one album I know of where the first half is better then the second half of the album, but all together it's still a great Bowie gem.<br /><br />If you like David Bowie, this is a MUST have!<br /><br />He is one artist that has really grown on me very much and is much more worth then just getting a greatest hits album of his. I might just buy them all!!

B00009P1O2|5.0|'Live At Wembley' is a superb live DVD of the final concert that Queen ever performed in July, 1986 at Wembley Stadium in front of 150,000 appreciative fans. Wow! That's a massive crowd there. The concert you see hear is a rock solid 75 minutes edited down from their actual two hour plus show.W hat that means is there's little bullsh*t, talking or stupid 'segments' that artists often stick between songs, especially on a DVD. If you're a Queen fan, you should REALLY enjoy seeing this DVD and will most likely wish to keep it in your collection for many years to come. I'm not complaining, mind you but the music sounds a bit different on 'Live At Wembley', perhaps it's because the large crowd is clapping so much. Really couldn't say for sure. Tunes I loved seeing over and over again are \\"One Vision\\", the foot-stomping classic \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\", their signature song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", their cover of Spencer Davis Group's \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" and their anthem \\"We Are The Champions\\". Only cut here I didn't care for was \\"Tutti Fruitti\\". I mean, they should've (perhaps) edited that out. A must-have. Great picture quality. Highly recommended.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|ok, avenged sevenfold started of with 2 amazing albums!!!! 5 stars to both!!! then, this atrocity came along, and shattered everyones dreams and hopes. ya, sure, the lead singer had a surgury on his throat and he cant scream anymore, but that doesnt change the fact that they sound stupid as hell now!! i have no sympathy!! and its not just the vocals, everything we all once knew and loved that was A7X is gone! and for good!!!! so rememebr what they once where, and try not to grimace to much at what they've become.
B000002UJQ|5.0|No question, one of the best albums of all time.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I hear people complaining about how bad this album is, that \\"they've turned to crappy metal\\" or \\"they're not prog!\\" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy a little album I like to call \\"St. Anus\\". True TOT isn't their best, but at least Mike Portnoy doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that John Petrucci can still solo. Seriously, I cannot believe how many negative reviews this album got! The poor liddle kiddies (or should I say kiddY) who are still POed at Kevin Moore for leaving the band must be working over-time. Seriously, don't you have lives besides writing negative TOT reviews all day? I bet 70% of the negative reviews came from the same person! Now that I got the rant off my chest, I will now review the album. Train of Thought, Dream Theater's 2003 studio album, is their heaviest yet. James LaBrie's vocals are as great as ever, John Petrucci still has those breath-taking guitar solos, John Myung's bass-lines are still HEARABLE, Mike Portnoy's drums are still amazing, and Jordan Rudess has those keyboard solos that sound like messed up guitar solos. Read on to see my review for the tracks<br /><br />1. As I Am - The first single. Sounds ver Metallica-influenced. I like the lyrics \\"I wish I weren't so ****ed\\". A favorite 5/5<br /><br />2. This Dying Soul - Very good song. Has a great double-bass pedal from Mike at the beginning. John's guitar solo rules. Also, at around 3:40, there's this CRUSHING riff. 5/5<br /><br />3. Endless Sacrifice - My second favorite song. It's very balladic, with a heavy chorus. The lyrics are very great. 5/5<br /><br />4. Honor Thy Father - The lyrics are a little lacking, and James' vocals can be better. but it still rules. Possibly the most chaotic song on the album. 5/5<br /><br />5. Vacant - The shortest and softest (also the only song without heavy riffs) on the album. It's not bad, but not my favorite. 4.5/5<br /><br />6. Stream of Consciousness [Instrumental] - It's an instrumental, and an amazing one at that! If \\"As I AM\\" is DT's \\"Enter Sandman\\", and \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is their \\"Fade to Black\\", then this is their \\"Orion\\"! 5/5<br /><br />7. In the Name of God - The BEST song on the album! About how Chrisitans use God to justify violence and inhumanity. The piano at the end sends a chill down my spine. 555555555555555555555555/5<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />Is \\"Train of Thought\\" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album? Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, one of 2003's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to DT's old sound, but if you are a true DT fan or just have great taste in music, feel free to purchase this.instrumental, and an amazing one at that!

B0000508U6|5.0|From the opening strings of 'Don't Panic', this is one of the very best debut albums in history. It goes from strength to strength, with 'Shiver' 'Yellow' and 'Trouble' being the standout tracks. It has a beautiful elegaic tone. Its not quite Scottish band Travis, or Irish band U2, it stands on its on right and is destined to be one day the biggest band in the world, once Bono puts down the microphone. I would strongly recommend that you buy it and listen to the whole thing right the way through - it will have you captivated. There may be some tracks that you mightn't be crazy about at first, but they'll grow on you. 'Yellow' is the song that made Coldplay. Chris Martin said that he found it amazing to owe Coldplay's entire career on the 4 and a half minutes of music that is 'Yellow'. Coldplay's music is constantly being used on television shows and movies. And rightly so. They have such amazing, beautiful music.
B000002TQV|5.0|It`s no surprise that  bands like Colplay,Travis,Semisonic and many more sound too similar..they just keep on trying to evolve The Bend`s sound , but in vain because The Bends was the original and that greatness cannot be matched.It`s painful to see how many imitators Thom Yorke has if we talk about his falsetto technique.Again, he`s the only one that sings credible that way because he sings that way to express emotions, not to sound nice. <br />This is a more conventional album than Ok computer or Kid A with almost no experimentation ,but includes timeless masterpieces those albums don`t have, such as Fake Plastic Trees , High and Dry ,The Bends.If you spend your money here, at least you`ll be sure of owing an essential album.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Ryan Adams is a hard musical artist to classify.  His style is all over the place.  At one second he's a hard driving, rock n roll star complete with outlandish and raw lyrics, and attitude and arrogance to land him in the headlines.  He's had that album, Rock n Roll, and he had the ultra depressed, and dark album, the dual disc Love is Hell. <br /> <br />Here we get something completely different.  We get a little bit of Whiskeytown, and a touch of his Heartbreaker recordings here, but a sound which is much more mature.  Here, Ryan defintely seems to have found his niche, and is currently in a very comfortable song writing groove.  There really aren't any songs you'll find yourself skipping over when going from disc 1 to 2.   <br /> <br />Each disc is short, 9 songs apiece totalling no more than about 35 minutes plus per cd.  But they're similar sounds.  Definite standouts would be Magnolia Mountain, Meadowlake Street, Mockingbird, and When Will You Come Back Home from disc 1.  Disc 2: Easy Plateau, Rosebud, and Blossom. <br /> <br />I honestly hope Ryan sticks to this kind of recording in his future efforts.  From what I've heard, he has 2 more albums coming out this year... that's incredible, and will be all the more incredible if the next 2 are anywhere's near this quality!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Surprisingly enough, I actually really enjoyed this album. Although I'm not an all around big Madonna fan, this is a definite exception. She has done something extremely original and innovative and I throw my hat to her for that.   Highlights for me include \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Easy Ride\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", and \\"I'm So Stupid\\".   Honestly, every track is good though (with the exception of \\"Nobody Knows Me\\"). I can't believe how much I love this album.
1881273156|4.0|I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend.  At the time, my marriage was on the rocks, and she thought this book would help.  It really opened my eyes to things that now seem obvious, like the fact that expressions of love are not always perceived as such by others. <br /> <br />Aside from marital help, however, the idea of five love languages (five primary methods of expressing love to others) can help people understand a whole range of other behaviors.  If a child brings you a lizard or a spider saying \\"Look what I found,\\" he is not trying to gross you out; he is showing you something that he found interesting because he likes you. <br /> <br />This book will hopefully help me look in to the motivations behind the actions and words of others more than I have in the past. It is too early to tell how this will impact my marriage, but I now understand much better what happened in the past and I have ideas on how to change things for the better.
B0006L16N8|5.0|WOW! Its been a long wait but hell it was worth it. I was bowled over by 'Talk' 'Speed of Sound' (the first single from the album) and the beautiful enchanting irressistibble 'Fix You'. 'White Shadows' takes a bit of time to grow on you but man, is it a wonder to behold. It builds and builds until it reaches a crescendo that will have you reaching for the pause button to play it back again. 'Talk' is fantastic and the most 'rock'n'roll' song I think Coldplay have yet done. The single 'Speed Of Sound' initially may feel like a steal off 'Trouble' and 'Clocks' but it grows on you until you can't help it when you finally can't help but listen to it again. 'Low' is another great track with 'A Message' 'Twisted Logic' and 'Swallowed In The Sea' being strong and holding their own. The simple and wonderfully stated eulogy to the late great Johnny Cash, Til Kingdom Come, is the hidden 13th track that isn't named on the back cover of the cd - but its there. X&Y will take a couple of listenings to get into the swing of it. Heck, three years on from A Rush Of Blood To The Head and only now do I really love 'Warning Sign'! Buy it and experience it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. X&Y will be continuosly be played on your CD player or iPod!
B000000WF0|5.0|The sound and production in this one are absolutely incredible.The string sections on Bittersweet Symphony, the guitar effects on almost all of the tracks,Ashcroft`s languid but hipnotic voice...it all creates a unique atmosphere that no one has been able to imitate yet.This sound would be the surf board if you were the surfer....It can transport you to beautiful landscapes and emotions,and you will finally sing to all the songs like a madman.Some will call this too slow,languid ,or boring but for me it`s fabulous mood music tripping.A pity they broke up after this release, i expected much more...There is touch of honesty redemption and hope in the album,and music can be your lifeguard sometimes.Surely they should have been through many bad things and they got over it with great effort.\\" i just can`t make it alone...oh no..\\" Truly good music deserves true 5 Stars.......
B000268QB2|5.0|When I bought this album, the only song I had heard was Somewhere Only We Know.  But time after time, I found myself reading rave reviews, saying this was the next big thing coming out of Britain.  Granted, it seems I read that about a different band every couple of weeks.   <br /> <br />But upon first listen, I was hooked.  My usual love for brit rock, with the driving guitar lines and riffs was completely taken over by this simple style of music.  What we have here is a very forumlaic album here.  Each song is driven by a piano line, with the strong vocals often hitting a nice falsetto at points.   <br /> <br />There really isn't a weak song on the cd.  I have heard a few live recordings of these guys, and they don't sound so great.. but with the wonders of studio recording, this is a terrific sounding album.  I would highly recommend it.  Very much looking forward to their next album!
B000002J2D|5.0|The first album as a trio and the last really great one as a trio. Fabulous musicianship including intricate, moving songs. After this they simplified their sound drastically kind of like the way Pebozo is pushing The Hoax. According to the recent Progression magazine, Phil is up for a reunion with Genesis. Let's hope they do music like this album and don't resort to silly songs like \\"Was it you or was it me??\\". I know pebozo would like that but most of us would like to here this aggressive, progressive Genesis found on this CD and all previous ones.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|With The Return of the King soundtrack, Howard Shore delivers a stunning masterpiece of a finale.  There is great, epic music on the CD that almost makes you a part of the movie.   <br /> <br />    There is plenty of new music here in addition to some new variations.  Most notably, is the Minas Mourgal music which is played at a blaringly fast pace that is quite creepy.  The best epic track is \\"The Fields of the Pelennor.\\"  Included is the amazing music from the charge of the Rohirrim that is sure to send a shiver down you back.  The final tracks do a great job of conveying the sadness of the Fellowship breaking up and Frodo leaving.  The final track performed by Annie Lennox is a very nice way to end the final score to the great trilogy. <br /> <br />     Howard Shore has composed three amazing, unique scores that are sure to be some of the best soundtracks you have ever heard.
B000069AUI|5.0|I was wondering how Coldplay could top Parachutes - the answer: they couldn't: they matched it. 'Politik' is a thunderous bombastic opener to the album - turn it up loud and your liable to be knocked on your rear due to the sheer power and unchained aggressiveness of it. 'In My Place' has a beautiful slightly understated opening and it will be without doubt one of your favourite tracks. 'The Scientist' is a beautiful track - the music video is very sad and kinda unnerving. 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face' is a track I found I liked more after I saw the music video. 'Clocks' is mesmerizing and instantly you'll find yourself unabashedly humming along to it. It probably is their most famous song now. I love it. 'Daylight' I'm not crazy about it but there are elements I like about it but the opening doesn't really attract me. 'Warning Sign' is very nice and bittersweet - it really represents this albums answer to 'Trouble'. Overall I can't find any major bone of contention with this album. I love it. In fact I'm listening to it right now...
B000000P11|5.0|After their two previous releases, we knew the chameleons could easily astonish everybody with their new,raw, intense and beautiful music;that does not change here, but good news was that they could actually rock.Once drummer John Lever turns on the powerhouse and the cranked up bass joins, you know that you won`t  be able to remain seated while listening to the cd.The guitars use unusual tunings,adding further beauty and exotic brilliance. <br />But above all of this there`s master songwriting , allowing you to discover something new after repeated listenings.At times the album is a bit dark,recalling past times to be much better than today,but truth doesn`t hurt..lol... <br />Song Swamp Thing can be familiar to you and if not, download it because it will be stick in your head forever.My favourites also include the terrific drummin` \\"Soul in Isolation \\",nice chord progression \\" In Answer\\" and upbeat tempo \\" Seriocity\\". <br />If you get this one , together with Script of the Bridge,you will notice how good and timeless 80`s music can be.Do yourself a favour and get both.
B000067CPX|2.0|The sound quality of this album is very good, and all the guys play their instruments very well and in new, sometimes startling ways: think the beach boys....but overall, this album is extremely dissapointing to me. Too slow, too melow. I have been a peppers fan for years and I do understand that bands need to change and elvolve and try new things to stay fresh. The problem with this is that the peppers dont even sound like a rock band anymore. \\"Californication\\" was getting pretty mellow but it still had that certain chili peppers energy. \\"By the way\\" just puts me to sleep for the most part. There are some great tracks, particularily \\"Cant stop\\" \\"by the way\\" and \\"this is the place\\" but others like \\"Universally speaking\\" just sound like flat, boring pop music! I know these guys have to change and try new things but when I listen to this cd it makes me think: why are they not exploring new funk/rock ideas? These guys are so good with their instruments, they could be playing some amazing stuff. Their latest single \\"FOrtune faded\\" gives me some hope..I would recomend this cd just to round out your collection, who knows maybe you will like it...or maybe not. Thanks.

1594200106|4.0|Trap doors, creaky floors, disfigured faces of strangers appearing in the dark, and all the things that go bump in the night. And this is just the \\"horror\\" aspect of this deliciously implausible novel that weaves together the tales of old lovers, family tensions, and Barcelona against the backdrop of 1950's Spanish Civil War. Does it always make sense? Not really. Is it a bit overdramatic filled with grandiose themes that outgrow reality? Yeah, sure. But, just as the characters in the book celebrate the love of a good story, so must every good reader who wants a few hundred pages of escaping into another time, another place, if only for a short while.  Woven together with many moments of genuine wisdom, The Shadow of the Wind is an entertaining gem.
B000286RKW|5.0|\\"Goodfellas\\" is not only the best mob movie--it is one of the best movies ever made, period.<br /><br />Many movies show you a world you've never seen, a reality far from your own that nonetheless appears convincing and true. But few movies do what \\"Goodfellas\\" does. When you watch this, you feel more like a participant than an observer: actors speak to you, introducing themselves, talking as if they've taken you under their wing. You, the viewer, actually matter to them--they want you to like and accept and understand them, even as they do things that are unlikeable, unacceptable, and difficult to understand.<br /><br />The movie opens with a harrowing, horrifying scene: a bloody mob murder in a deserted wood, lit only by the red tail lights of a parked car. There are no clues as to motive or meaning; there is only pure, unadulterated brutality. Why, the viewer wonders, would anyone choose to live in a world so horrifying?<br /><br />Henry Hill, protagonist, narrator, and mob foot soldier, shows you why.<br /><br />After the jarring initial scene, the movie jumps back to his childhood, and Henry puts his arm around you and tells you a story. These men may seem cruel and immoral to you, the viewer, but to Henry they are gods. It's the ultimate childhood fantasy: they do what they want, talk to who they want, eat what they want, stay up as late as they want. No parents, no teachers, no cops, nobody to tell them \\"no.\\" It's a glamorous, flashy world, fast and loose, so far removed from the day-to-day grind of Henry's family that he's instantly drawn to it.<br /><br />For the first half of the movie, there's no reason to disagree with that judgment. Henry and his friends grow older but remain young, brash, immature, and beholden to no-one. And they face no consequences for their actions: a judicial slap on the wrist is the harshest punishment Henry ever faces, and even that is occasion for back-slapping and joking. It feels like paradise.<br /><br />Only mid-movie, when we see the lead-in to the initial murder, do we really understand what Henry already knows: this is a world where saying the wrong thing, making a flip comment while drunk at the bar, can get you killed.<br /><br />Henry and his friends continue in this lifestyle even as it eats them up, one by one. Near the end of the movie, Henry is a coked-up washout with no friends and no future, a paranoid equally afraid of police helicopters and burnt pasta sauce. The fantasy life he so lovingly constructed has fallen apart around him, has nearly killed him: objectively speaking, he should be glad to just be alive. Instead, he longs to return to the life. He misses the fun, the power, the glamour. \\"Everything we wanted was for the taking. And now, it's over,\\" he laments, and he's explained himself so convincingly and pulled you so completely into his life that you, too, understand and lament.<br /><br />This two-disc special edition further blurs the lines between fact and fiction by giving the real-life Henry Hill a chance to comment on the proceedings. The \\"Cop and Crook\\" commentary features Henry and Ed McDonald, the prosecutor who brought Henry down, observing and analyzing events. It's not a perfect commentary track--there are far too many pauses and dead spaces, and McDonald frequently has to prod Henry into talking--but it's fascinating (and even more so in light of Henry's subsequent arrest on drug charges); one senses that they almost regret the power of the movie, because so many people miss the point, seduced, like Henry, by the flash and the glamour. They also touch on events from the book not covered in the movie, like Henry's stint in the Army and his role in various basketball point-shaving scams. (The other track, featuring Scorsese, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, cinematographer Michael Balhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, is nothing super special. They spend most of their time talking about how the movie came to be made and how they turned a great book into a great movie, but they also seem somewhat awestruck, overwhelmed by their creation. They've captured lightning in a bottle, and they're at a loss to explain how they did it.) Still, people (like me) who already owned the previous DVD edition of the movie will probably find this new version worth buying, not only because of the \\"Cop and Criminal\\" track and the good-but-not-great documentaries, but (most importantly) because the DVD is no longer a \\"flipper\\" and you can now watch the movie from start to finish with no interruptions.<br /><br />Anyway, if you just want to observe mob life, buy \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"Donnie Brasco\\" or any number of other great movies. But if you really want to feel like you're living it, buy this; it is a great piece of cinema and an absolutely indispensable piece of crime literature. Before I saw it, I had a hard time understanding why anyone would want to be a gangster; afterwards, I had a hard time understanding why anyone wouldn't.ck, overwhelmed by their creation.

1582403589|2.0|I had great hopes for this graphic novel. Generally each film or book brings something new to the genre even if they aren't of the highest quality. This dull piece of work actually managed to bring yawns to the table. The so so artwork is only topped by the ho hum story. My advice is avoid, go online and read some of the many amateur zombie works that far out class this stinker.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Roger Waters first solo album is terrfic you will never know what happens when you first listen to it. Unlike Final Cut It keeps you guessing and speechless. And unlike the Wall the music shows more influence and spark. The dynamics and tembre set the mood of the songs and the direction they go in. To the first dentist drill sound to the final sputtered out line at A Moment of Clarity. The album is continous and flowing with the acoustic guitar thing weaving in and out of the pieces. If there is an album that can let your imagination soar like this one I would want to hear it.
B00008ADPF|4.0|I don't know what's crawled up a lot of people's arse but this album is pretty solid. No not all mainstream music is the exact same generic stuff over and over. Nickelback prove that and if you listen to all their albums, they're not all the same. Sure some riffs maybe be recycled but I'd like to see one of you write a riff that doesn't borrow from an older one or someone doesn't recognize because it's just not possible anymore. Anyways I think this album is good because it's a bit heavier than most of their other stuff. Just because there's no flashy solos doesn't make them repetitive. With songs like Throw Yourself Away (sounding like some of Metallica's St Anger which people also tend to moan about) I find it hard to get bored with this cd. Though not every song is solid. I hope Nickelback continues to make more heavier music than this and keeps going just to piss off the narrow minded people who say they're generic. I also hope as Chad plays and becomes better, his solos will improve too as now solos are coming back ala Velvet Revolver. These guys are good solid rockers and talented. Quit moaning about genericness and piss off. Go back to your heavy metal bands and let these guys continue rocking on without your worthless whining.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I really liked this movie alot , going in the theatre not knowing who Constantine does or what powers he had I just knew it was another comic book movie and it was great for me, but the only (Explicit word here)problem I have with Warner Bros. is that they dont know what DTS means!  I am just completly fed up with them, I mean imagine how the MATRIX TRILOGY would sound in DTS, you name some other Warner bros titles that deserve high quality sound...this pathetic Dolby Digital 5.1 is good, dont get me wrong, but if you people who dont know what DTS is go here (...) to summerize DTS...the bitrate is much higher than Dolby Digital, in other words it sounds louder and more clear, So clear you can hear the diffrence.  Believe DTS is a great technology for DVD, its a shame warner bros doesn't think so, i'm really fed up with WB.  If you own a Home Theatre system and haven't heard of DTS technology..boy you dont know what you are missing, its like a whole new meaning to the word home theatre. You'll be looking for DTS DVD's after hearing the diffrence. I would of given it a five if WB would think about DTS
B000063JDE|5.0|\\"Blue Velvet\\" was the first American film to fully explore the uncharted darkest regions of the subconcious mind, in the manner of European directors, like Bunuel and Fellini. No American director has broken open as much creative space as David Lynch, not even Robert Altman.<br /><br />\\"Blue Velvet\\" was the right film at the right time. In 1986, there was a growing backlash against the vacuous Hollywood blockbusters, as evidenced by the popularity of artistically ambitous films like Platoon, Hannah and Her Sisters, Salvador, A Room With A View, the Mission, and Children of A Lesser God. Movie goers hungered for more substantive films, and the pioneers of the art house megaplexes, like Landmark were anxious to corner the market those kinds of film. Bad news for your friendly neighborhood art house, good news for \\"Blue Velvet.\\"<br /><br />The fact that Lynch was able to bring his singular artistry to television, a few years later with \\"Twin Peaks\\" is a measure of the public demand for Lynch's provactive style of filmaking. The fact that his recent \\"Muholland Drive\\" was orginally shopped around as a pilot for a series and had no takers, not even cable stations, is a barometer of how times have changed over the past 4 or 5 years.  Decadence undermines the fabic of morality, and wierd movies send the wrong message about America, to people who need to get the \\"right\\" message.<br /><br />\\"Blue Velvet\\" stood further left of center than other the films of artistic merit,and went far enough out on the limb attract a devoted cult following. In 1986, if you were in film school, \\"Blue Velvet\\" became an artistic model of acheivement. Young directors aspired to make the next \\"Blue Velvet\\",not the next \\"E.T.\\" or \\"Jaws\\" as the previous generation had aspired to make.<br /><br />On the eve of the 20th anniversary of it's release date, critics and movie fans still hold the meaning of \\"Velvet Blue\\" as a sacred topic of discussion. It's influence is tremendous but it still retains the uncompromising edge of an anti-movie film.<br /><br />The film is resistant,nearly immune to all attempts to probe the nature of it's meaning. The film offers no apoligies for it's Baudelairian view of human nature. Debating the allegorical content of \\"Blue Velvet\\", seems to miss the entire point of David Lynch's artistic statement. Like Baudelaire, Lynch is at a loss to explain the brutal extremities of human behavior.<br /><br />Each time I watch \\"Blue Velvet\\", I uncover new layers of meaning in, the script, the motivation of the actors, the function of a prop, or even in a the use of an unconventional camera angle. The \\"Blue Velvet\\" I watch in 2005 is entirely different from the one I saw in the theater in 1986.<br /><br />The wooden nature of Kyle McLaughlin's acting only magnifies the volcanic nature and the primal appeal of Dennis Hopper's performance. Do you have the courage to really rip loose like Hopper? ...or do you hide in the closet,like Mr.Goody Two Shoes who peeps with lurid fascination at the performance? The rock star charisma of Hopper's wild man bulldozes Kyle McLaughlin's wholesome sex appeal straight into the closet where it belongs.<br /><br />The strength of \\"Blue Velvet is it's own inscrutability. Lynch's steadfast unfliching gaze at the most sinister impulses of humanity, is the metaphorical \\"gorilla in the living room\\" that nobody wants to talk about. Your reaction to \\"Blue Velvet\\" tells as much about yourself, as it tells you about the morality of the characters on the screen.<br /><br />As in all of his films, Lynch points out the contratdiction between the our high minded moral aspirations, and the predatory nature of our own behavior. The sunny small town innocence of \\"Blue Velvet\\" conceals a dark underworld of depravity that is governed by fear and violence. Our fascination with erotic nature of evil makes all of us willing particpants in the corruption of our own innocence. It's a message that stands at odds with own image of ourselvesas decent,god fearing people.<br /><br />Scrubby clean hands are capable of committing the most horrifying of deeds...just ask Lady Macbeth.

0451457994|5.0|I've never finished a book so fast in my life.  So many books are called \\"page turners\\", and this book pretty much showed me what that means.  2001:  A Space Odyssey is by far the best book I have ever read.  It keeps you hooked all they through with it's compelling storyline and suspensful and descriptive writing.  Read it if you haven't, and even if you have, read it again.
B0007GFFVQ|1.0|Does anyone have the final word on the degree to which Astralwerks (sic) have screwed up these Eno 'remasters'?  <br /> <br />'Another Green World' has the first bars of 'Everything merges with the night' missing, 'Climate Study' is missing from 'More Music For Films, and someone below states that the intro to <br />'Quartz' on this album is also truncated. Are Astralwerks just a bunch of amateurs or something? Eno must be well pleased with this mess..  <br />
B0000000LI|5.0|Wow this cd is pure magic.  Just listening to Yanni whale on the guitar through numbers like \\"Rain Must Fall\\" and \\"One Man's Dream\\" brings to mind high school dances and other illicit high school activities with the boys.  The squeal of the guitar on this album is saturated in the emotions that his trying to portray with an array of sounds that are drenched in emotions that come deep from the soul of Yanni.  This is a beautiful piece of music.  Buy it!
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay definitely has a lot of talent, and prove it with a few songs.  I'd like to know what happened with all the other tracks.  The two previous albums were better, but you still hit the skip button too often.  Speed of Sound is way too hyped.. a great song but not worthy of all the praise its gotten.  Talk is good, and so is square one. and the J Cash cover, til kingdom come (the bonus track) is excellent, but not even their own really.  So that makes 4 good songs, inmy opinion, out of 13 tracks.. not even 1 out of every 3. <br /> <br />I recommend saving your money and downloading some of their songs and making a mix.  Unless of course you'll buy a cd for one or 2 good songs. <br /> <br />But if you really want to buy coldplay, or are new to the band, \\"a rush of blood to the head\\" is probably the best to start with. It's easily their best cd with the most creative sound.  i'd say about half is good and the other half isn't.  typical coldplay however. <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album displays a7x evolving into a band that goes beyond genre labeling. Musically they have matured and are showing the world that they are \\"musicians\\" and not just some cookie cutter hardcore/metal/insert your label band. I am a bit disappointed by the vocals (not enough GRR RAH!), but it is still a great performance. This should definitely be in your collection.
B000065K5G|4.0|I, too, am a big Jane Austin fan and read the novel before watching the film.  There are inaccuracies (Fanny's older brother, William, is completely left out), but if you are looking for an enjoyable period romance with good acting, you will likely appreciate this adaptation.  It certainly is easier to like Fanny in this film than it is in the book.  She's much more empowered.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Only the Eagles! I caught this concert on t.v. a few weeks ago,  and couldn't wait to buy it on dvd! I wish all groups sounded  this good, 30+ years after they started! The sound quality of  this concert, WILL AMAZE YOU! Just buy it, it's the best $21.00  you'll ever spend! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
0790730960|5.0|Batman Returns is a very dark Batman movie from director Tim Burton. It has solid music, beautiful visuals, a great cast, a good plot and great action. After rewatching this movie, I realized how mad I was that Tim Burton didn't continue directing the Batman movies. Unfortunately Jerry Bruckheimer then took over and made a really average movie while using up 2 of the best Batman vilains: Two-Face and the Riddler. That is a shame because I know that Burton would have made a much better movie. Tim Burton is such a fantastic director and he incorporates fantasy in all of his movies. From Mars Attacks to Big Fish to the Nightmare before Christmas to Batman Returns, he always uses the unreal, surrealism and fantasy.  <br />This movie does greatly incorporate fantasy and the result is a fantastic movie.  <br />The plot is about a unique and grotesque man named Penguin (Danny DeVito) who collaborates with the powerful Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) with the hopes of ridding Gotham of its energy supply. Batman (Michael Keaton) has to deal with them and Penguin's henchmen but also has to deal with the mysterious Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is trully in love with Batman.  <br />Batman gets framed and much more in this very dark movie. The visuals are fantastic and the Penguin is beautifully brought to life thanks to the makeup and of course the marvelous Danny DeVito. Michael Keaton once again is great as Batman and is in my opinion as good as Christian Bale. Christopher Walken is fantastic as is the wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer (Meow!!!).  <br />The movie has very good action scenes and very good character development. Salena Cayle (Michelle Pfeiffer) goes from a lonely secretary to a victim of an atrocity and a lunatic. She then becomes Catwoman, and believe me, her costume is brilliantly made. You might pity the Penguin at times but when he turns crazy, you sort of do but not really. You disslike Max Schreck a lot and love Batman thanks to his outfit and Michael Keaton. The batmobile is great and there is one awesome chase. I don't want to give away any of the action or other things so that you can discover this marvelous masterpiece on your own. This one along with the original Batman are two movies that deserve to be in everyone's collection. But if you have to chose between the two, Batman Returns is a superior film.  <br />This is how I'd rate the Batman movies going from best to worst: <br />-Batman Begins <br />-Batman Returns <br />-Batman  <br />-Batman Forever <br />-Batman and Robin <br />Batman Begins (when it comes out on DVD), Returns, and of course the original all deserve to be in your collection. But, stay FAR AWAY from Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, as they dissgrace and are an affront to Batman.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Best Batman movie ever.There's no comparing the other Batman films to this one.The special effects are grade A.The story is awesome.Batman Begins offers you all the great stuff you crave in superhero movies.You know how you look at the heroes' weapons in movies and you would like to see more.Well Batman Begins gives you plenty of information and looks at his weapons and the Bat suit itself.Batmans enemies are great , he has alot of enemies one including his co-owner of Wayne Enterprises.This Batman movie is the best ever.To be honest it's the best movie I seen in 2005.But I didn't see Star Wars Es.III.But it beats any other flick out there.It's 2 hrs. and 15 minutes long , so you get alot of action and Batman himself.I seen this movie twice already and it was good for the second time too.Go to the theaters and see this movie.Pick Batman Begins over Star Wars and Mr. Mrs. Smith , I promise you , you won't be disappointed.    thanks god Tim Burton didn't direct this movie.superhero movies don't need a freaky director.only smart ones that  make good stories like Chis Nolan the director.He should win some kind of award for putting Batman back on the map and capturing the true like and story of the Dark Knight - Batman.Oh yea he's not the cape Crusader anymore try \\"Dark\\" Knight.His character is dark , likeBatman is suppose to be.  5 big stars.    Batman Begins rocks !!
B0002858YS|4.0|after purchasing the album, i came to love the music, every track..that is not common...on a CD..to enjoy EVERY track..unfortnatly i read a review that said that THE KILLERS were nothing more than a pop band with a terrible guitarist, and disguised to sell nmore records, although I am a huge KILLERS fan, I believe that there is some truth in the fact that the KILLERS are a disguised, pop boy band, with a guitar, and eye makeup to further consumer appeal...buy the album, and find out for yourself, over all...still awesome!
B000002UB3|5.0|Though I'm sure every album ever released period has been hailed as the \\"best ever\\" by someone, Abbey Road beats out popular favorites such as Exile on Main Street, London Calling, Highway-Sixty One Revisited, the Beatles' own Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Born to Run, Back In Black, Led Zeppelin IV (a candidate for the most overrated album ever) and most certainly the snooze fest that is The Dark Side of the Moon. The only album that comes close is Coltrane's masterpiece A Love Supreme, but since that's a jazz album it's like comparing Martians and oranges.<br />Even most of the one-star reviewers (except for the ones who prefer the God-awful Limp Bizkit and Korn) will agree that George's Here Comes The Sun (the best song ever in my mind - then again, that title changes once a week for me, so I'm not to reliable there) and Something are the best songs on the album, which they are. Unfortunately, George was only allowed to write a small handful of good songs (two per album, for the most part) and he really shines here, delivering two of my three favorite Beatles tunes (the third being A Day in the Life). Not to discount everyone else, of course - the 16:28 Side Two Medley that runs from You Never Give Me Your Money to The End was Paul's defining moment as a Beatle, and was heavily influential on the prog-rock movement, for better or for worse. Elsewhere, John's Come Together and ethereal Because, as well as Paul's '50's rock homage Oh! Darling and hilarious ode to a serial killer Maxwell's Silver Hammer shine. Even Ringo finally turns in something worth listening to: the vaugely country-influenced Octopus' Garden maybe a kid's song, but like Yellow Submarine it's a damned good one. Even the overlong proto-metal experiment I Want You (She's So Heavy) holds my interest, at least through the first half.<br />The one-star reviewers quite clearly don't know what they're talking about. I mean, having different musical tastes is one thing, but believing that the Beatles are incapable of making good music simply because they're British is racist, and anyone who had any clue about anything would NOT say the Beatles should break up, simply because they did 36 years ago, leaving a gaping hole in the world of rock music. And Norwegian Wood was NOT the band's only hit (they have 27 #1's to their credit, two - Come Together and Something - from this album alone, and that's just the #1's), in fact it wasn't even a hit in the first place. I will agree it's a good song, though.<br />An easy five star, and rock's defining album.re incapable of making good music simply because they're British is racist, and anyone who had any clue about anything would NOT say the Beatles should break up, simply because they did 36 years ago, leaving a gaping hole in the world of rock music.

B00007GZR5|5.0|This film is nothing less than a visual masterpiece!  Excellent acting, subject matter, and glorious special effects and cinematic treatment.  The theme at hand affects us all, as we are all going to die one day and leave loved ones behind.  I cannot say enough great things about this fantastic piece of work!  Those that dis it are doing so out of sheer myopia and pre-conceived expectations.  Ignore the naysayers.  They have NO conception whatsoever of good style, artistry, and form.  To hell (pun intended) with them!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Too bad there wasnt a 0 star choice because Greenday is one of the worst bands ever made. If you little emo kids think these guys are punk then please, go kill yourself now and save our world from being filled with poseurs. This album is a waste of time, and these guys are useless in music and at life. YOu people who think Greenday is punk most likely shop at Greenday and buy Anarchy shirts with no clue wtf it is. **** you all and good riddance(by the way, a horrible greenday song, oh wait, their all horrible).
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I'm not a fan of musicals.  I hate almost all of them.  The only other musical I like was Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I never saw the Broadway productin of The Phantom of the Opera and I am not a fan of Joel Schumacher, the man who killed Batman.  I didn;t like Phone Booth and overall, I think he is a mediocre director.  In The Phantom of the Opera, Schumacher outdoes himself.  He faithfully follows Webber's play, but he also improves upon making the battle for Christine's soul in a major fight between good and evil and making his Phantom a person who is evil and clearly thinks he is above every one else.  Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine.  Her voice is lovely, but she is able to pull off the conflicted young woman with aplomb.  The scene where she sings in the theater for the first time is pure magic and the scene in the graveyard before the fight is heartbreaking.  Gerard Butler is a fine villain.  He makes the transition between sophisticated gentleman and psychopath at will.  The harshness in his voice contrasts well with Rossum's polished vocals.  Minnie Driver is outrageous as Collatta and Patrick Wilson is fine as Rauol.  Overall, I totally enjoyed this film and I'm not a fan of musicals, but this one is excellent.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|The Corrs do nothing more or less than simply amaze me with their pure ability to capture the listener's soul and hold it in a tight rapture. I brought this CD at a second hand music dealer and it's a Australian release with 19 tracks and the bonus tracks of 'Lifting Me' and the previously unreleased 'Make You Mine'. The classic hit songs are mixed with the unreleased songs and also mixed in with this wonderful CD are several remix songs like 'All The Love in The World' and 'What Can I Do' which are two remixes that are on par with their original counter-pieces.<br /><br />This CD has helped me in a time where I have had several family problems and Andrea Corr's voice has given me hope and the belief in being strong and carrying on. This Album is for everyone new Corrs fan's or old fans of The Corrs. Even if you are looking for good pop music with Gallic flavour this is the CD for you. This band is a masterpiece.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I bought \\"X&Y\\" around the same time I bought the Killers' album, and I find myself listening to The Killers much more often.  I loved \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\", but it took a few listens for all of the tracks to grow on me.  Now ARoBttH is easily my favorite CD of all time.  I'm hoping that repeated listenings will improve X&Y, but truthfully I end up falling asleep to most the tracks.  So far, my favorite songs are \\"What If,\\" \\"White Shadows,\\" \\"Speed of Sound,\\" and the bonus track.  The CD is really well-done - it's just so sleepy, from beginning to end!  Some of the songs are just plain annoying.   <br /> <br />I gave the CD 4 stars because I'm assuming it will grow on me as I listen again and again, and the songs begin to distinguish themselves from each other.
0151008787|5.0|In \\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\"  the Israeli novelist and political essayist reflects on his childhood.  Oz tells of a morning writing the book in Arad, he is working on chapter 36, and says: \\"I don't know what can contribute to the progress of the story, because as yet I have no idea where this story wants to go, ....\\".   Certainly, Oz is  trying to understand and come to terms with his childhood, but I think his primary motivation may be even simpler: to better recall his youth and the people who were important to him, for Oz makes clear he does not have an exceptional memory, and that sometimes, like an archaeologist, he is recreating a memory from fragments (and whatever help he can get from other first person accounts of the time). <br /> What made reading this book such a memorable experience? Certainly, Oz is a talented writer.  It is unlikely that someone who is not a novelist could write prose as well, or recreate conversations and scenes as well.  Oz's childhood was eventful, and at least in his hands, his family life is interesting.  Oz offers a feel for a time and place (lower middle class life in Jerusalem in the years 1939-1948) as well as  fascinating stories about his ancestors, particularly on his mother's side.  What  really sets this book apart, however, is Oz's personality itself.  You have to love and admire this man - and enjoy his sense of humor. <br /> \\"A Tale of Love and Darkness\\" could have benefited from better editing.  I would advise the reader to keep in mind that Oz was born in 1939, for the book can be imprecise about  dating events, and some readers might wish to begin by looking at the family picture on p.509.   <br />
B0007GAERG|3.0|Ok this album I bought over the single\\" It's Like That\\" a good single that wants you to get up and dance.  Then the overplayed single \\"WE Belond Together\\" is now at #1 for it's fifth week. It took me awhile to get use to this album I do like the song\\" Shake it off\\" and \\" Say Somehtin\\" but thats about it She can do better than this and I believe in her ability to do better than what this album is.
B0006JC4UO|1.0|RE: McLintock! Starring John Wayne Digitally Remastered & Sound Enhanced In Color (1963)<br /><br />What a JOKE!!!  This doesn't even deserve a rating, it's THAT BAD, but I have to give is something!!  I made the mistake of purchasing this DVD because I thought FINALLY they've come out with the fantastic version that's on VHS put out by the John Wayne family.  NO WAY!  This looks like all the other CHEAP DVD versions I've seen.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  Wait for the original from the Wayne family archives.  I wish they'd hurry cause this is one of my favorite John Wayne movies!!!
B000099T2L|4.0|Well I was expecting no filler on the album, but their isn't much of it.  With her single \\"Crazy in Love\\" is a great dance tune and it hit # 1 for 8 weeks straight on the billboard charts. \\"Baby Boy\\" another great dance song hit #1 for 9 weeks straight on the billboard charts.  I loved those two singles and I bought the cd after that, but she released to more great songs \\"Me Myself, and I\\" which hit #4 and the great dance tune\\" Naughty Girl\\" peaked at #3 on billboard charts.  Other songs beside the singles that stick out on the album are \\"Hip Hop Star\\", \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\", \\"Yes\\", \\"Signs\\" and \\"The closer I get to you\\" The album itself hit #1 on the billboard charts and was certified 3x platuim. Go BEYONCE!
0316776963|3.0|Before I read this book, I read \\"Naked\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" also by David Sedaris. I liked those much better. <br /> <br />\\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" often seems forced, with situations that fall flat on their face - Sedaris watching young men get injured by angry cows, Sedaris watching a girl almost fall off a halted amusement park ride, Sedaris flubbing an IQ test in French, etc. The opening essay, about seeing a speech therapist in high school and Sedaris's ability to avoid the letter s (which would reveal his lisp), isn't very funny.  <br /> <br />Also, oddly, the book reads as a tribute to Sedaris's father, which is strange considering Sedaris's light mockery of him in other books. \\"Naked\\" is more of a tribute to Sedaris's mother, and that felt more natural somehow. I know from his other books that there was a lot of tension between Sedaris and his father on account of Sedaris's sexuality, and that tension seemed to be missing between Sedaris and his mother. <br /> <br />The book also suffers from a dearth of Paul, Sedaris's funniest sibling in my opinion. \\"Corduroy and Denim\\" features lots of Paul and is all the better for it. <br /> <br />Probably the best essay in the book is the one based on the title, which documents Sedaris's struggle to learn French. He can't keep track of which nouns are masculine and which are feminine, and he recounts the butchered language in which he and his classmates comfort each other. Touching and funny at the same time. An essay about his sister Amy and how she wears the lower half of a \\"fat suit\\" home for the holidays is also very funny.
B00006CXXU|5.0|THis album shocked me and I was expecting the album to sell real good \\"Stripped\\" debut at #2 on the charts and was 3x platuim.  But her singles and songs still amaze me with her vocal ability.  Her first single \\"Dirty\\" is a great dance tune that just wants you to get up and get dancing.  Her next single \\"Fighter\\" was an anthem great song with vocal range good as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" another great uptempo song.  Her biggest song was \\"Beutiful\\" which hit #1 for 12 weeks straight on the billboard charts. This is album has so many good songs with her beutiful voice of hers.  Such as \\"Soar\\" and \\"Infauation\\" which are both great songs. Other Stand out songs \\"Voice Within\\", \\"Make Over\\", \\"Cruz\\", and \\"Loving Me for Me\\" A great album you will love it in a heart beat!
B000002B5L|5.0|Many hip-hop artists today don't even come close to what Lauryn Hill, Wyclef, & Pras can do together. This group has talent. It was painful to see them split after \\"The Score\\". But even then, all three had very good solo careers. Their reunion performance at the 2005 BET awards proved they still can bring down the house anytime, anywhere, any day.    After almost 10 years, \\"The Score\\" is still definitely one of the best hip-hop albums ever made. The skits will either grab your attention, have u laughing silly, or set you up for the next hit. All tracks will have u bopping your heads from start to finish.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis expresses her self angry on the inside then deeper down in the album she expresses her self as smart song writer and with her unique vocals she makes this album work and I can't wait to get the 10th anverisary acoustic edition of this album. This album hit # 1 on the billboard charts for 12 weeks straight and was 11x platuim which means it sold around 11 million copies in its time.. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" sold approx 27 million albums world wide to date. Every single track on here is good and has it's own unique meaning with Alanis witch makes this album so special. I believe she is the best female song writer in the world.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I really don't understand the raps on this cd.  People say it is not as heavy as their previous releases.  I could not disagree more. It is every bit as heavy and even more cohesive than previous releases, especially the last one, Train of Thought.  The first track The Root of All Evil and the seventh track, Sacrificed Sons are as heavy as anything Dream Theater has ever released.  I really enjoyed Sacrificed Sons.  Maybe it's just me, but when i heard the climax of the this song, it reminded me of Diary of a Madman, and that is truly high praise.  No one to my recollection has ever mimicked Randy Rhoads as inspirationally as John Petrucci on this track.  Sorry, I know my spelling is off a little bit, but the thought is there!
B000063DIR|3.0|Yeah The remasterd remixed wasn't a very smart move of ozzy but he tried something new... and if u don't listen so deep into the song You hear him repeating the chorous in the back round but to occaisonal fan this is a good cd to buy. STand out tracks \\"Flying High Again\\" \\"Over the Mountain\\" \\"SATO\\" and \\"Diary of a MADMAN\\" Enjoy fellow METAL HEADS!
B00005JNNZ|5.0|My daughter came over to visit this weekend, and she suggested that we rent this film. Since it stars Samuel L. Jackson and is about a high school basketball coach, I thought that it sounded promising. Well, it turned to be more than just promising. It is a movie that held me riveted to the screen the entire time it was on. Samuel L. Jackson is simply outstanding in the role of a high school coach who sees basketball as the means to an end and not the end itself.<br /><br />Based upon a true story that took place in Richmond, California, it centers on a man named Ken Carter. He was asked by the retiring basketball coach of Richmond High School to return as a part-time basketball coach to the school from which Ken had graduated and left his mark many years earlier. The school is one of those schools in which people barely graduate and, of those that do, most do not go on to college. The basketball team was no great shakes either, having won only four games in the entire previous year.<br /><br />Finally, Carter is prevailed upon to take over as coach. He has, however, decided that he wants to make a difference. He starts off by letting the team know who is boss and by trying to instill discipline and respect. He wants to go back to fundamentals. He wants to put the emphasis  on being  a student athlete. To this end, he makes it clear just what his expectations are. He drafts a contract that those who wish to remain on the team, as well as their parent,  must sign. Some of the conditions are that  the players must attend class, do their schoolwork, and pass their classes. Those who signed the contract ended up making  the best move of their lives.<br /><br />Coach Carter keeps his side of the bargain, turning the team into a formidable one on the court. Suddenly, basketball at Richmond High School begins commanding attention. Notwithstanding this, he still emphasizes that they are to be just as committed to their studies. While one might expect some resistance from the student athletes to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves. What is amazing is the resistance that he experiences from the teaching community who are reluctant to give him progress reports on how his players were doing academically.<br /><br />When Coach Carter finally gets his long awaited progress reports and discovers that some of his student athletes are not holding up their end of the contract, all hell breaks loose. Even though they have had an undefeated season so far, he basically locks the gym and tells his players that there will be no more basketball, until he sees some academic improvement. To his surprise, the school board,  as well as the parents, does not support him in this matter, and the situation becomes a media sensation on the West Coast. Support comes from an unexpected source, the student athletes themselves.<br /><br />This is a heartwarming story about a coach who cared and dared to make a difference in the lives of kids that had little or no future. What he did for those students was incomparable, as he basically gave them a chance for a better life. Samuel L. Jackson is sensational as Coach Carter, dynamic and totally believable in the role. The young men who play his student athletes likewise give excellent performances. Ashanti also gives a surprisingly well nuanced performance as the girlfriend of one of the student athletes. Moreover, for those who enjoy great basketball, the on court scenes are extremely well done.<br /><br />At the end of the film, there is a summary of what happened to these young men. When the viewer sees what happened to them, the viewer cannot help  be but touched by the turn of events. Moreover, the DVD has a featurette on the real Coach Carter and the real student athletes for whom the appointment of Ken Carter was literally a life saving measure. This is a very well acted, deftly directed,  inspirational film and one that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.e student athletes to such a change, one would expect support from the educators themselves.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|As her bubble gum pop routs she kinda matures on this album and makes more flexiable songs.  \\"Me Agaisnt the Music\\" is a nice duet with Maddona and a great dance song.  Her Next Single \\"Toxic\\" which is the reason why I bought the album.  Her Next single\\" Everytim\\" I didn't like this song at first but it grew on me and I learned to like it alot.  Another great dance song on the album are \\"I got that BOOM BOOM\\" and \\"Outrageous\\" I personally respect her more as an artist because she is now wrighting her own stuff other songs that stand out are \\"Showdown\\" \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", \\"Shadow\\", and \\"Early Mornin\\"  I strongly adivise to ignore the bad reviews and try something new and buy this album
B0001KZM4I|5.0|If you are reading this review, it may well be that you know the original album and want to know about the additional CD.  If this is not the case, you need to know only that \\"This is the Sea\\" is one of the finest albums of the decade (the 80's) in which it was made.<br /><br />So to the additional CD ......... well, if you chose to buy this prepare to be astounded.  The opening track \\"Beverly Penn\\" will leave your jaw on the floor, wondering how this beautiful song (lyrically and musically) possibly remained unreleased, even on the original album.  Elsewhere you get full length versions of Spirit and Medicine Bow that more than enhance the original releases.<br /><br />Add to the smorgasbord a number of terrific studio recorded instrumentals, some of which form the basis of completed songs that made the final released album.  There's also a live version of the title track recorded before the studio version and a number of other songs that in most cases were inexplicably left off the final running order.<br /><br />After a week with this, I've come to the conclusion that the extra CD beats the pants off the original...... and anyone who has lived with \\"This is the Sea\\" for two decades will find that hard to believe.  But then so would I have done until last week .....
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light showed Madonna as a great song writer in her own right. As I can't tell you the billboard staticts of this album since I don't have them right now I do know the singles I know that Frozen peaked at #2 on the billboard charts and it is easily one of the most inspirational songs!  This album talks about how she acted in the past \\"Your Frozen when your heart is not open\\"  Same with \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" told you that in the 80's she just wanted to make herself happy not everybody around her.. Other good songs on the album are \\"Subsitute for Love\\", \\"Power of Goodbye\\", \\"Swim\\" and \\"Sky fits Heaven\\" Go get lost in the RAY OF LIGHT !
B00005LC4B|4.0|Cape Fear is a heck of a joyride. Scorcese's remake is brutal, fast paced, and quite creepy. Deniro is mennacing, repulsive, and mesmerising in his role. Great cameos from the two original actors, (Gregory Peck & Robert Mitchum). The music is explosive and the performances are just as good. Good to see the wonderful Jessica Lange exhibit her acting talents, far much greater then the lame King Kong remake in 1977. The true diamond in the rough is Juliette Lewis's performance. Outstanding as the easily deceived and young daughter of Sam Bowden,(Nolte). This film at times may be predictable, but you honestly are glued to this film, and hoping Nick Noltle prevails and rid of this creep. Max Cady, (DeNiro), ranks up there with Freddy, Michael, Jason, but Max is human, and he can be stopped. If I was a lawer, I wouldn't have messed with this guy by any means. Have a good time......I did!
B000002BQK|4.0|Mariah sure does shine when it comes to her singles hitting #1 on the billboard charts. MY All and Honey where her #1 hits from the album but are not the only good songs from the album.  For example \\"Butterfly\\" I love this song... Same with \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Fly Away(Butterfly Reprise)\\" and \\"Close My Eyes\\" Of course \\"My All\\" and \\"Honey\\" are great Mariah songs but so are some others on the album not saying all them but the ones I mentioned sure will do it.
B000000W6F|5.0|I'll never forget seeing the \\"Siva\\" video on MTV's latenight 120 Minutes alt music video show for the first time in summer 1991 and knowing right then this was going to become one of may favorite bands. (I think hearing Smells Like Teen Spirit for the first time was close to the same feeling!)I bought the album immediately and was astounded by the complexity, rock, drumming, layers, psychedelia and melodies.  Like another recent reviewer hinted, Gish defined part of my life as I was entering college. This was a great time for music - Janes Addiction, Pixies, Nirvana, etc etc, the list is endless.  I still like this album the best, despite my enjoyment and respect for the change/influx of SP's sound mid 90's to more electronica. I also feel like BC did not whine as much when singing on the early stuff. His voice at times can be a tad annoying in the later years.  Regardless, I think it is best for anyone getting into any band to start with the first album in most cases and go from there. This one will not disappoint. Siva, Snail, I Am One, Bury Me are my favs.    Like another reviewer, I too saw SP sandwiched in between Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers on that 1991 tour, wow!!!
B000000I3O|5.0|This album is awesome and for who don't have the songs \\"London Dungeon\\" and \\"Ghouls night out\\" they are found here if you don't have the singles  cds or the box set with the rares or the 12 hits from hell.
B00092ZL80|5.0|We saw the show last night in Scranton,PA and boy, was this some show. We took our 23 year old daughter who had grown up listening to Earth Wind and Fire.  She knew Chicago's music but didn't know the name of the group to the music that she was familiar with. Both groups came on together at first and then EWF did their thing. Chicago came out and rocked the house some more. We rocked for hours! It was a little chilly outside for the brief moments that you weren't on your feet shaking what your mama gave you, clapping and all those other things that people do when you are really, really enjoying what you are hearing and seeing.  There were some who maybe weren't familiar with one group or all of the groups music but it made no difference, they still rocked and had a good time.  As one woman said to me as we left, \\"This is the best concert I have even been too\\".
B0000648WZ|5.0|After having read quite a few of the reviews, I had to respond.  A lot of the reviewers are trying to compare Robert Heinlein's book to the movie.  They are two different animals. Look at \\"Minorty Report\\" by Phillip K Dick.  In my opinion, nothing like the movie.  I'm just going to review the movie because that is what this is about. <br /> <br />I found that I actually cared for these characters.  I enjoyed this film from begining to end.  I even liked the Zoe Poledouris version of the David Bowie song \\"I Have not Been to Oxford Town\\" at the Graduation Dance.    <br /> <br />This film can be analyzed as a Nazi propaganda film or as a critique of Fascism or as a good, fast paced, sci-fi flick.  This movie was created to entertain and that it does.  I was suprised by one thing however, that Casper Van Dien could carry this film, but he does! <br /> <br />There is plenty of nudity in this movie which I thought was overdone.  I was plesantly suprised of hardly any profanity though.  Kudoes to Verhoeven and Industrial Light and Magic for a classic.
0316172324|1.0|When I am falling asleep, my eyes start to blink rapidly... then I am out!  While I admit, that that book does have some interesting information, all of the tangeable thoughts could have been written into a magazine article.  There are too many repititions of the same story - seemingly just to fill the 288 pages with very little new information added.  I remember writing similar essays in school; you kow, repeat information just to fill up the 10 page requirement. <br /> <br />I am amazed that the editor and publisher of this book though it was well written enough to print.
0385720920|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who related a story about a reading by Palahniuk, complete with fainting old ladies and styrofoam body parts that Palahniuk threw into the audience.  \\"If you read anything,\\" he said, \\"read Choke.\\"  Now I fear the taste of my friend is in serious question.  Chuck uses lots of colorful metaphors for various sexual acts and the more relevant parts of his body, but his imagination appears to have abandoned him after that.  The print was big, the sentences bland and uncomplicated, and he's cheekily prone to repeating choice phrases that are as bland or moreso than rest.    It was somewhat reminiscent for me of highschool, if you can imagine being accosted by a group of horny, unintelligent and loud mouthed lacrosse players.  Anyhow, I'm glad those days are over, and the metaphors really weren't all that clever.  I don't have anything against sex or books about sex, but I like it with a little content.  Don't bother.
B0007RT9LW|4.0|When I first heard about this movie I wasn't sure if I would want to see it.  I mean a movie that basically sounds like a storyline right out of the \\"Grand Theft Auto\\" video game series doesn't sound like a promising film.  So, I didn't go to see it in theaters, even though I saw that it was doing solid numbers at the box office and had good reviews from people going to see it, though the critics thought this movie was garbage, everyday society thought it was a great caper movie.    \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" is an incredibly fast-paced thrill ride that will leave you breathless.  The movie begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) attempting to boost 50 cars before a deadline that is four days away.  One of the cars he boosts from a dealership causes him to be chased by police and he inadvertently leads the police directly to the warehouse where numerous other cars out of the 50 are being stashed.  Needless to say, the police cease the cars and Kip is now in a life or death predicament that he cannot escape.  Enter Kip's older brother, Randall \\"Memphis\\" Raines (Nic Cage), Memphis is a legend of car-boosting who after numerous run-in's with the police walked away from his life of crime and seemingly all of his family and friends without looking back.  Now Memphis must return to save his brother by boosting 50 cars in what is left of the original timetable established for his brother, which leaves Memphis 3 days to assemble a team and boost the cars before his brother dies.    A surprisingly good storyline and script, with excellent actors chosen to flesh out the parts, \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" rises above the mediocrity it should have been destined for.  Most movies of this type would have had a hip, young cast that were essentially newcomers to acting and it would have been average, but thanks to super-movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer (producer of \\"The Rock\\" and \\"Armageddon\\"), the movie gets the A-list casting treatment with the likes of Nic Cage, Angelina Jolie (looking goodeven in dreadlocks), Giovanni Ribisi, and Robert Duvall.  If you are a fan of films like \\"The Fast and The Furious\\" or even the lackluster sequel \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\", or even the original \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" that this film is based on, then you shouldn't miss this extremely entertaining movie.  By the way, this review is for the \\"Gone In 60 Seconds: Director's Cut\\", though I have to admit that I hadn't watched the theatrical version in some time so I'm not sure what was changed in the film, but I recommend getting the director's cut for any film just so you get the movie as it was originally intended to be.    \\"Gone In 60 Seconds: The Director's Cut\\" is unrated, and contains violence, language, and minor sexuality.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|I wasn't as wild about CASINO as I was about GOODFELLAS when I first saw it.  I thought CASINO tried to take on too big of a story.  GOODFELLAS was just one hood's story of the Mob from the 1950s to the 1980s--very smooth and steady.  But CASINO was not only spread out over three interesting characters, but it also tried to tell the story of Las Vegas itself.  At least Vegas of the 1970s.<br /><br />(To be honest, as much as I love Robert DeNiro, I thought his character would've been more interesting if he'd been played by a less powerful presence.  I don't have a problem with his performance--he was great--but I think someone a little less threatening would've made Pesci's monster scarier.)<br /><br />To pack it all in, CASINO had an almost-nonstop narration from a lot of the characters.  After my first viewing, I felt as overwhelmed and frazzled as a weekend in Vegas.<br /><br />I know these almost sound like complaints, but they're really just quibbles.  It's Scorcese, DeNiro, Pesci, another true story of crime and life and death in America.<br /><br />And Frank Vincent, after getting slammed in a car door by Pesci in RAGING BULL and getting stomped, knifed, and shot by Pesci and DeNiro in GOODFELLAS, finally gets some payback this time around.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited for this edition: I loved the outtakes with Scorcese's mom shooting her scenes of reacting to bad language (and scolding her own son when he repeats a line!), and, since this is a true story, you can watch the History Channel's show about the real story with the real people.<br /><br />The cameos are great: Don Rickles, Dick Smothers, L.Q. Jones, even Joe Bob Briggs.  The current mayor of Las Vegas appears as who he was back in that day: a lawyer who actually represented the guy Joe Pesci plays.<br /><br />CASINO is a sprawling but finely-crafted film about a Vegas that just doesn't exist anymore.
B00005JNJT|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" brings a breath of fresh air to the tired and weakened \\"Batman\\" film franchise.  Although it lags a little when compared to Tim Burton's original \\"Batman\\" flick, it more than makes up for the drivel that followed it.  Christopher Nolan directs this Bat with care and a harsh degree of reality.  He also manages to make a Bat that is considerably darker, moodier, and more atmospheric than Burton's.  That's hard to pull off, but Nolan does it.  David Goyer handles the script rather well, and manages to make a film that is appeasing to the mind and to the eye.<br /><br />The story introduces us to the events that lead up to Bruce Wayne's becoming the Dark Knight.  It plays out as if the other films never occurred.  Wayne's parents are murdered and he witnesses the crime.  The killer gets off after serving a few years, but a series of events leads to the uprising of a crime boss with a stranglehold on Gotham City.  This prevents Wayne from exacting vengeance on his parents' murderer.  Angered, Wayne seeks out the criminal mind, learning everything he can about them(including prison life), but it is when he meets up with Ra's Al Ghul and Ducard where we find out how he masters numerous fighting styles and skills.  When Wayne returns to Gotham, the city is in shambles, and he sets out to make things right.  What follows is  a wonderful story that has a few twists and turns and some wonderful action.<br /><br />The story realizes its characters so well that the viewer forgets that they are watching a film based on comic books.  It doesn't seem quite as silly to believe that a man can become so enraged with the criminal element that he would dress up like a giant bat and fight for justice.  If I had to categorize this film with any other comic flick, I'd have to say that only \\"The Punisher\\" with Thomas Jane and John Travolta comes close to the realism expressed in \\"Batman Begins.\\"  However, \\"Batman Begins\\" is a much better film than \\"The Punisher\\" could ever be.<br /><br />Christian Bale seems to be a perfect fit as Bruce Wayne/Batman.  He looks comfortable as a billionaire playboy and as a masked vigilante.  Some folks have made fun of the way he changes his voice when dressed as Batman.  Has anyone thought that perhaps he changes his voice so that he becomes harder to identify?  Michael Keaton spoke with a raspy hiss when he was under the cowl, and Val Kilmer and George Clooney did little to mask their vocal identity.  Also, Bale's Batman is intent on striking fear into his enemies.  If some dude in a batsuit comes up to you with a booming voice and batarangs flying all over the place, you'd probably get scared too.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as Sgt. Gordon.  He's a nice guy who only wants the best for Gotham.  Problem is, the criminals run the city, which makes it a little hard for Gordon to do his job.  He becomes a strong and worthy ally of Batman as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Michael Caine is wonderful as Alfred.  Though Michael Gough's Alfred will always hold a special place in my heart, Caine makes the role his own in \\"Batman Begins.\\"  He is the one true source of comedy in a film as dark as this one.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is very believable and likeable as Wayne's weapons expert.  He's responsible for all of Batman's gadgets and the wonderfully big and loud Batmobile.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy, who I'm not very familiar with, is seedy, twisted and perfect as Dr. Crane/Scarecrow.  I've always believed that Scarecrow deserved to be in one of the other films, but I'm glad that they held off until now.  Murphy's a weasel and his eventual send off is downright fun to watch.  He was perfectly cast in this part.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is solid as Ducard, a man who seemingly has a deep concern for Wayne when he is learning the arts of justice under the tutelage of Ra's Al Ghul.  Much like his Qui-Gon character from \\"Star Wars:  Episode I,\\" Neeson fills the role of mentor perfectly.<br /><br />KatieHolmes is sufficient in her role as Wayne's love interest in the flick, but her role is probably the weakest in the bunch.  Also, all of her publicity with Cruise lately made it harder to believe in her character.<br /><br />Although there are plenty of special effects, there isn't much CGI.  That's a beautiful thing these days, when most comic flicks rely heavily on the oft-fake-looking gimmick.  Instead, we get plenty of explosions, close-up fight scenes, and lots of crashes.<br /><br />In short, this is a wonderful flick that fans of action, drama, and suspense will love.  Remember, this pic does not come across as a comic book film, but as a legitimate story that has some wonderful characters and great atmosphere.  I give it a strong four stars, although Holmes' performance is somewhat of a downer., but her role is probably the weakest in the bunch.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles Farewell Tour DVD is easily the best concert DVD produced to date.  The band was possibly in their best form ever. Like a fine wine, aged to absolute perfection!    <br /> <br />In my modest collection, I have around 25 concert DVDs.  What I look for in a good concert DVD is that \\"being there\\" feeling that a good DVD should deliver. This comes from great camera work, sound and image quality, the performer's effort and set list (song selection). Most of all, is production quality and keeping the usually interesting and much wanted \\"bonus material\\" such as interviews and clips in their own section. This DVD is truly perfect in every aspect. <br /> <br />The Eagles Farewell Tour DVD delivers on all of these points to perfection and a MUST OWN.  All of the Eagles hits as well as a lot of Glenn, Don's and Joe Walsh's solo work are performed superbly. Go buy it!
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I was hoping that this movie would be more subtle and sophisticated than it was; after all, if the flapping of a butterfly's wings can make a remarkable difference, why go for the jugular? But then, Hollywood and popular culture in general has never known from subtlety.<br /><br />But in viewing \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", I knew that at the very least I'd have an opportunity to study Ashton Kutcher's most intriguing face, since I'm not about to watch his other movies/TV shows. I also was able to confirm that I'm much more disturbed by animal cruelty than I am by violence against people. The scene in which Kutcher's character goes back in time and prevents a dog's  death; well, at least he got that much right!<br /><br />The plot involves the story of a young man (Kutcher), who as a child blacks out whenever something disturbing happens. Yet by keeping a journal from the age of seven on, he is able to revert back to the past when he reads the journal as an adult, giving him the opportunity to make changes. However, the changes he makes (dog story excepted) create dire consequences as well. Overall, the events are just a wee (as in weeeeeeeeee...) bit melodramatic. Had he just tweaked a few details of moments BEFORE they became major events, he might have smoothed things out. But the story as is just has WAY too much ego, when you think about it. I know darn well that whether I live or die, or had never existed, in the grand scheme of things it doesn't hardly make no never mind.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album amazed me in a way I never thought possible. I bought their album \\"Slipknot\\", but was not too impressed with the over-the-top sounds and lyrics. But this CD made me realize that Slipknot is pure metal genius. Their songs go from the slow and thought-provoking \\"Prelude 3.0\\" (which I didn't care for) to the hardcore \\"Before I Forget\\", a masterpiece in my eyes. \\"Circle\\" is the kind of song that makes you realize that Slipknot is not just some washed up has-been of a metal group. Extremely different from other tracks on previous CDs, this song is taken slowly and tenderly, with a feel of longing and emotion that is truely brilliant. The same goes for \\"Vermilion, Pt. 2\\". This song is amazing in the way that it can take basically the same lyrics of \\"Vermilion\\" and put a spin on them that is so different from any other song on the album. If you truely enjoy heavy metal, but you might just have a softer side, this CD is for you. It is not lacking in the hardcore riffs of past Slipknot albums, but this CD shines in a way no other can. <br /> <br />P.S.: By the way, can anyone tell me what exactly that is on the cover?
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Hey, what's up??  Man, do I feel like a woman!!!  I love this C-dee!!!  I love Shania, too!!  Her songs are so spiritful and full of joy and life...man, I feel like a woman!!!  She has an udderly fantastik voise and she knows how to shake her groove thang!!  Hah, hah.  But seriously, when me and my girlfriendz hit the beach or the mall, we always bring along our burned copy of this Shania Twain Greatest Hitz C-dee...we love it!!   <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Mutt messed up the Hq frequency on a few of the tracks; it would have been much better left at a lower-pitched treble.  Also, I take issue with Lange's use of chorus overdubs that often drown out the bass and even overshadow Shania's voice on a few songs.  Then again, with the drums so loud at almost all times, I guess that a lack of bass sound can be forgiven, despite the lack of an authentic swing.  The mixing job on some of the early stuff is adequate at best, but that's okay.  Mutt Lange is a wizard at the control board, and his expertise definitely shows on Twain's later work.     <br /> <br />Well, I'm off to the mall... <br /> <br />YOU GO, GIRL...AND MUTT, TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have known quiet a few people who have been Coldplay fans for the last some years. However, I have recently (2-3 months) started listening to them, and for me, going from Parachutes to A Rush of Blood to the Head to X&Y has been an extraorinary experience. <br />After quiet some time has a band managed to hold my attention for so long - without wanting to hit the next button on my iPod. <br />Highly recommended for people looking for new music or for others who have been listening to Coldplay for a while and would like to continue this wonderful journey and experience.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Ok, so let me start off by saying yes, this movie can be KORNY at times, this is one of those movies that if you watched them when you were a kid, you'll charish these movies for your life! I just love this movies soo much, maybe not the Next Krate Kid so much, but all of them send a STRONG message. I will always love these movies. I couldnt say enough about them, I am a BIG martial arts movie fan, no matter how KORNY they might be. Yes including 3 Ninjas and TMNT. Anyway, many people might not understand why people like these movies so much, but like i said you really have to be watch these as you were a kid, or its hard to understand why we LOVE this movies!<br /><br /> Go get these movies if you LOVE martial art films. I would prob recommend this movie to KIDS more than Adults first. But GO GET IT!
B00005JLR2|4.0|Perhaps the failure to include a standard-issue spunky, perky, sassy \\"girl-power\\" counterpart to Jim ultimately doomed this movie . . . I don't know.  The NC Wyeth-inspired art direction and superior source material should have made TREASURE PLANET a huge success for Disney--instead it was virtually disowned by the company and ignored by audiences.  Judging by the inflated price of this DVD, Disney is still trying to recover losses.  But even at the higher price, this one is worth it, especially if you have boys (or tomboys).  Read Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND to them first (or show them Disney's fine live-action adaptation starring Robert Newton) and then treat them to this clever sci-fi spin on the classic tale.
1932907009|5.0|This is the best all-encompassing book about screenwriting that I have read (and I have read many).  While Synder doesn't include as much academic structure information that books like Robert McKee's Story do, it offers extremely useful advice and exercises to get ideas flowing.  Reading the book has inspired me to get to work on my next screenplay.   If Snyder taught a screenwriting class in New York (or online) I'd sign up in a minute.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The movie has only 3 redeeming features: the performances of Natalie Portman and Clive Owen, and the fact that it makes dating in the real world look like fun in comparison.  The story centers on 4 people whose self-absorption (with the possible exception of Natalie Portman)is absolute, which is hard to understand because none of them is particularly interesting or remotely likable. It's amazing that they don't get as tired of themselves as I got of all of them within a very short time.  They use sex to simulate relationships, but none of them has a clue as to how to really relate to another person. They inflict a lot of pain on each other, but since they are all dark and empty people, why lose sleep over it? <br /> <br />Julia Roberts is refreshingly low-keyed (\\"bland\\" might be a better description, but at least I didn't have to wear sunglasses to avoid being blinded by her teeth), and Jude Law's character is so unattractive that he manages to forfeit all sex appeal, but Clive Owen conveys some emotion through the filter of his utter repulsiveness, and Natalie Portman's performance shows the makings of an actress who may become one of the true greats if she learns to hold out for decent material. <br /> <br />If there's a point to this, it's that the author of the play and Mike Nichols should either increase their Prozac or keep their depression to themselves.
0394818237|5.0|I had this book as a child and I loved it.  I remember how I used to sit and study the pictures.  I remember how much there was to find and see in each one.  <br /> <br />   Now I find that my 2 year old is just as fascinated as I was with the book, and it's such a wonderful way to explain how so many things work, and what things do.   <br /> <br />   My only complaint with the book is that it lives at Grandma and Grandpa's house.   <br /> <br />   I don't know about this version but the original is well bound with heavy paper and just the right size to fill those small laps so they can see every detail.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was riveted from the first frame until the final bow.  Shot in this vibrant and warm tone, every performance shines.  You really get a sense of how much these people loved George Harrison and seem to sense his presence throughout the entire evening.  A radiant tribute that any fan should see.
B000002P2W|5.0|I was incorrectly thinking that this might be a CD that I would play for thirty seconds, and then skip from track to track hoping to be seduced with a wonderful sound. Well, I put it in and never stopped it. I thought that Townshend's new songs here would be bloated and ugly, nothing but obsceneties wrapped in melodies that were either okay or sub-standard. While there is some offensive upheaval on this classic album, it is full of beutiful melodies, strong performances by every member, and some of the most emotional and catchy writing Pete had ever done. Quite simply, the album rocks, and it was neither depressing or off-putting to my ears. The subject matter is gritty, as Pete wallows in self-doubt, but Entwistle is awesome on this recording (no, I mean he's better than his usual outstanding self). Also, I don't think people give Pete enough credit as a great singer. For a while, I was starting to like Cream better than the Who, but the fact is that the Who simply have better singers and ideas. Not only does the album have Pete's strong voice, but Daltrey is great too. The Who By Numbers restored my faith in this band, and reaffirmed them to me as real musicians (rock musicians). You're on different turf when you hear the Who, but this is powerful music and deserves a place among their finest work. Don't be afraid to try it.

Leur meilleur album reste sans conteste le deuxime, Hats, discrtement sorti en 1989, alors que les charts anglais taient squatts par les Stone Roses et les Happy Mondays... Drle d'poque pour publier ce monument de pop mlancolique! <br />En fait, j'ai cout cet album des centaines de fois, mais je l'ai entendu, je l'ai viscralement vcu  des milliers de reprises : combien de fois la majestueuse mlope d'ouverture, telle un chant sacr surgi de la nuit des temps (\\"Workin' night and day...\\") a-t-elle retentie dans ma tte, combien de fois me suis-je surpris en train de fredonner l'invraisemblable pont \\"The stars in your eyes\\" (peut-on encore parler de \\"pont\\" pour des chansons aux structures si lches et originales, tellement dtaches des classiques formats pop?), combien de fois ai-je assist, impuissant,  la sublimation des envoles clestes et surrelles de Paul Buchanan (\\"Yeah, fly little angel\\"), qui rsonnent dans mon esprit sans jamais en sortir? <br />Difficile de dgager un titre phare, tant le niveau des compositions est effarant : l'imptueux The Downtown Lights, avec ses arrangements grandioses au-del du raisonnable, et son extatique final (\\"I'm tired of crying on the stairs\\"), le dmesur Headlights On The Parade, qui transporte l'auditeur bahi vers des contres lointaines et imaginaires, pays o il ne serait question que de puret et de lumire, ou From A Late Night Train, titre  la mlancolie indfectible, mouvante confession  la femme aime, o le chant crpusculaire de Paul Buchanan est littralement bouleversant. <br />Un album ahurissant de beaut contenue, dont on ne sort pas indemne, inimaginablement charg d'motions, totalement hors des modes et hors du temps, sans le moindre quivalent recens dans la pop music - seuls peut-tre quelques titres de \\"Quiet Storm\\" du grand Smokey Robinson, ou bien Nixon,le chef-d'uvre country-soul de Lambchop peuvent trs timidement supporter la comparaison avec les cinq premires odysses, assourdissantes de beaut languide, qui se bousculent  l'entre du disque... <br />
B0000255CL|5.0|Wow, this is absalutely one of the best things I've ever heard. I bought Sons of Northern Darkness a while back and kinda forgot about them after I had worn out my C.D. The riffs on this C.D. are so technical and cold, and the vocals are incredible. My Favorite song on here is Solarfall, it's just...I can't put it into words, buy this c.d.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sorry, this is not that much of a review, more of a cooment. I first heard Sigur Ros by complete accident and their music painted pictures of a mystical snowy land, harsh, yet somehow magical and painfully beautiful. Then I discovered they were from Iceland. AHA! But the pictures don't end there. I took part of this album with me when I went to Africa. When I was on safari watching the huge herds of zebra and wildebeast stampede across the serengeti I put on my headphones and listend to UNTITLED 8. When it reached the powerful ending, I cried. The music fit as perfectly in an open plain in East Africa as it does in its homeland. I don't know how these guys have done it, but they have captured the beauty of nature, or life, or the complexity yet utter deliciousness of existence and they had put it to music. Slow and aching, yet an ache of subtle yet powerful beauty instead of pain, though at times the album does hurt... it's GORGEOUS!
B00006IU73|5.0|I was recommended to this album by a friend.  I had never heard of PT before, and frankly, this was not what I expected.  It was way more.  From the opening crunchy riff of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" to the Coldplay-esque \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth,\\" this album is awesome.  <br /> <br />Blackest Eyes <br />A very good song.  The heavy, crunchy riff disappears into a mellow, melodic verse and catchy chorus.  Concise, but very effective.  One of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />Trains <br />One of my favorites on the album.  I love the acoustic solo intro, which is a very good contrast from the previous song.  Steven Wilson's vocals on this song are very good, and it's got a folksy-sounding guitar solo in the middle.  Excellent. <br /> <br />Lips of Ashes <br />Very atmospheric, not much lyrics, but beautiful. <br /> <br />The Sound of Muzak <br />My other favorite on the album.  A negative look at the bland, cookie-cutter music that today's \\"demographic\\" wants.  Very catchy opening riff. <br /> <br />Gravity Eyelids <br />Not my personal favorite, although a good song nonetheless.  I really like the heavy guitar near the end of the song, which is a stark departure from the moody, light atmosphere of the first part of the song. <br /> <br />Wedding Nails <br />One of the best instrumentals I've heard from anybody lately.  I could listen to it over and over and not get tired of it.  Not too techincally intricate, but very interesting nonetheless, Wedding Nails is definitely a standout on the album. <br /> <br />Prodigal <br />Another good song, and one of my favorites.  Steven Wilson's vocals stand out on this track.  Very good performance. <br /> <br />.3 <br />I love the opening bass riff on this song.  It seems like it's going to be an instrumental, but near the end of the song, Wilson repeats the lines:  \\"Black the sky, weapons fly/Lay them waste for your race\\"  Very good effects on this song. <br /> <br />The Creator Has a Mastertape <br />This song is interesting.  It's got a catchy bass riff, and a good distorted guitar solo at the beginning, and the distorted lyrics sound cool.   Not my favorite on the album, but a very good song nonetheless. <br /> <br />Heartattack in a Layby <br />I could go to sleep to this song.  It is very beautiful.  Wilson does a wonderful job capturing the mood of this song with his sad-sounding, morose vocals.  I love the falsetto jumps at the end of the song, as he fades with \\"We'll grow old/together\\" repeatedly to the sound of a car passing by. <br /> <br />Strip the Soul <br />A stark contrast from Heartattack.  Another cool bass riff, but not one of my favorites on the album, because of its weak chorus.  It sounds good, but the chorus just doesn't do it for me.  There is a good guitar solo near the middle of the song, which is one good thing about the song. <br /> <br />Collapse the Light Into Earth <br />I find myself singing this song to myself frequently.  It sounds very Coldplay-ish, shich is a good thing.  After the verses and the last chorus, Porcupine Tree close out this album in stunning fashion with a string section that is simply beautiful.  One of the top 3 on the album, with Heartattack in a Layby and The Sound of Muzak. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an EXTREMELY good album, and I would greatly recommend this album to anybody who is willing to step a little bit out of their musical comfort zone.  I certainly did, and I am happy for it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was one of those fans that had the opportunity to see Star Wars: A New Hope in the theater in 1977.  So I've seen every Lucas variant of his masterpiece.  While the original vision is very special to me, I don't have any major problems with his new version.  I mean the audio and video is much sharper.  The new CGI looks great and doesn't detract from the story.  I actually like the fact that Han Solo shot first.  It really helped flesh out his character a little better.  Remember that he was a drug smuggler, so is him shooting a two-bit bounty hunter first really that big of a moral dilemma?  While Han was a likeable enough guy, he made it perfectly clear that he was concerned for himself first and foremost.    For the Jabba scene: I think why he didn't kill Han on the spot was he assured Jabba he'd get his credits.  Jabba may have seen a gamble to get his money and then kill Solo.  Also a blaster fight in a hanger would assuredly tip off the Stormtroopers.    My only beef was with having Hayden Christenson's Anakin in the shot with Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end of RotJ.  Why would his spirit look like the person he was 25 years before he died?  Huh?    So shame on the people that only gave it one star because it is a LITTLE different.  It is still a great trilogy and will still stand the test of time.  As an old time original SW fan I say change can be a good thing.
B0002I831S|5.0|Here it is, the original, first season of Star Trek, presented uncut and in its original broadcast order.  What a lot of people don't know is that when shows are sold for syndication, cuts are made to the episodes to allow the broadcaster more time for commercials.  If you're one of the people who caught Star Trek for the first time in syndication (and not during it's original run on NBC), you almost undoubtedly have not seen the episodes in their entirety.  It's nice to have them uncut here, running at about 50 minutes each.  The picture quality is good, though the sound seems to be a little loud at parts (like during the credits).  Not all of the episodes are great -- I've never cared much for \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\" -- but there are some real classics here, such as \\"Arena\\", \\"Errand Of Mercy\\" (with the first appearance of the Klingons), \\"Space Seed\\" (with the first appearance of Khan), and of course, \\"The City On The Edge Of Forever\\". <br /> <br />This is classic television, and classic Trek, before it was run into the ground and beaten to death by Paramount, Rick Berman, and Brannon Braga.

B0007TKH66|1.0|I'm not sure if the decision to make a Star Trek prequel was influenced in any way by the *Star Wars* prequels, but whatever the reasoning, it didn't pay off.  The recent cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise (originally just titled \\"Enterprise\\") is vindication to myself and others who used to be Star Trek fans, but feel that the series (or as the execs call it, the \\"franchise\\") has long since lost its way.  I was reminded of the reasons I dislike the newer Trek shows recently when I tuned into Enterprise and in a matter of one minute heard the words \\"gravimetric\\" and \\"anamoly\\".  Trek used to be about good, smart storytelling, and not about technobabble and using technologocial \\"deus ex machinas\\" to solve their problems each week.  In fact, one of the early Star Trek writer's guides states that, while grounded to the best of their abilities in science, the episodes should not rely on science at the expense of storytelling (or something to that effect). <br /> <br />While Scott Bakula is good as Caprain Archer, I had a hard time telling any of the other characters apart.  This wasn't due to a lack of talent or skill on the actors' part, but rather the writing, and for that matter, costuming, made it hard to distinguish one from the other.  Then there's that whole matter of a \\"temporal cold war\\", the alien alliance which looked all-too similar to the seperatist aliens in \\"Attack Of The Clones\\", and the willingness to just toss Trek continuity out the window.  I'd like to thank co-producer and scribe Brannon Braga for almost single-handedly taking something that I used to enjoy and beating it into the ground.  Sure, it's impressive that he worked his way up the Trek totem-pole from intern to co-producer, and that he hooked up with Jeri Ryan, but the guy has no respect for the fan base that made Star Trek a success, and not a short-lived, forgotten TV series.  And don't I sound like a total geek now!  But in all seriousness, Trek used to be an enjoyable TV series with important social commentary (not to mention entertainment value), but is now off the radar for the forseeable future.  Paramount, if you're reading this, please do the following: <br /> <br />1. Bring in a fresh producer and fresh writers. <br />2. Create a new series.  It doesn't have to be some mega-original idea, just something that will entertain and not INSULT the core audience.  Maybe give George Takei the opportunity he's been asking for, and create a Captain Sulu series -- this would interest the hardcore fans who have long-since tuned out. <br />3. Give it a modest budget, and don't overkill on the merchandising.  Let the stories do the talking.  Braga says the fans have Trek \\"fatigue\\".  That's only partially correct -- we aren't fatigued of Trek, we're fatigued of BAD Trek.
B0001IN0DA|2.0|Do NOT buy this DVD unless you want to watch a movie full of boredom. <br />Let's review the matches: <br /> <br />1- John Cena vs Big Show- VERY Boring match. It just had Big Show dominating for about 10 minutes until John Cena pulled of the FU, hit Big Show with a knuck, and another FU for the win. Big Show got very little damage, but was down for the 3 count. This was to amuse the fans. 2/10 <br /> <br />2- La Resistance vs Dudley Boys vs Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs RVD and Booker T- Very obvious Booker and RVD would win. Nobody else stands a chance and if they won, their reign would last a few weeks. Very good movoes by RVD, he turned it up a notch. 8/10 <br /> <br />3- Christian vs Chris Jericho- This seems like a match that was intended for the Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar. This match didn't have too much hype, but the fight lasted WAY longer than expected. 3/10 <br /> <br />4- Rock & Sock Connection Vs Batista, Ric Flair & Randy Orton- This is the only match out of two that I liked. Every other match the crowd had no emotion. This one was perfect, disappointing ending, but WWE is unpredictable. This is the match that awakened the crowd. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />5- Playboy Evening Gown Match:Torrie Wilson & Sable Vs Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie- Quite boring, even though I get a kick out of Stacy Keibler, this match seems like one for teens that can't control their hormones. 1/10 <br /> <br />6- Cruiserweight Open-Cruiserweight Title-Chavo Guerrero(C)Vs Ultimo Dragon Vs Shannon Moore Vs Jamie Noble Vs Funaki Vs Nunzio Vs Billy Kidman Vs Rey Mysterio Vs Tajiri Vs Akio- Terrific match, very high risk manuevers done, very exciting. We get to see the Tajiri Mist, the fan favorite that is rarely seen. Good ending. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />7- Special Referee-Stone Cold Steve Austin-Goldberg Vs Brock Lesnar- ABSOLUTELY THE WORST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. I, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, EXPECTED THIS TO BE A STREET FIGHT STYLE MATCH. INSTEAD, IT WAS A SLOW PACED MATCH, LIKE BIG SHOW VS ANOTHER GIANT, WHERE NOTHING COULD BE DONE. HORRIBLE MATCH. (Rumor has it that Brock Lesnar, because this was his last match, didn't care about the crowd so he did not memorize all of his actions in this match, which resulted in improvising, which doesn't work well in the WWE). I only liked the ending, where Stone Cold stunned Lesnar. 0.5/10 <br /> <br />8- Match Eight-Fatal Fourway-Tag Team Championships-Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty Vs The Bashams Vs The APA Vs Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin- Great match, very tense. I expected APA to Win, but Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty did. They didn't get much hype, but hey, that's the only acceptable WWE Tag Team around. 6/10 <br /> <br />9- Victoria Vs Molly- Vince... I know Molly is quite good looking.. but don't bore the entire crowd by making such a boring, useless match. 1/10 <br /> <br />10- Eddie Guerrero Vs Kurt Angle- Great match, beginning was hard to get into, but the ending made it very thrilling and that's what a crowd likes. 7/10 <br /> <br />11- Undertaker vs Kane- Lots of hype, very little action. Seems like a decent match from SmackDown! or RAW. Sort of like the Goldberg vs Lesnar, only a bit more action. 2/10 <br /> <br />12- Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michaels vs Triple H- The only good match of the night. Obviously, Chris Benoit would win because he won the Rumble (That's how WWE works), but it was still a good match because for once, there was lots of action and tension. 9/10 <br /> <br />Total is 55.5 out of 120 <br /> <br />46%, that's an F. <br /> <br />Good Job Vince McMahon <br /> <br />The most hyped Wrestlemania turned out to be the worst of all-time
B0001L3MI0|3.0|A former co-worker of mine used to say that this film was really just a B-Movie that had a big budget, and I have to agree.  I was psyched to see this film when it came out, having shades of \\"War Of The Worlds\\" and \\"V\\", but was ultimately disappointed in what turned out to be an unintelligent film with a \\"you gotta be kidding me\\" ending.  A big departure from their previous film, \\"Stargate\\", which was in many ways a polar opposite.  \\"Independence Day\\" is entertaining if not taken seriously.   <br /> <br />The DVD also includes commentary by producers/writers Dean Devlin and Rohland Emmerich.  Each of them says \\"This is my favorite scene\\" about 3 times each, and Emmerich sounds like he learned English in the valley (\\"Like, y'know, this is, like, my favorite scene, y'know?\\"). <br /> <br />Not a bad way to spend 2+ hours, but not the best either.
0679720200|3.0|This novel begins with the main character's mother dying. He describes with dispassion the funeral and his lack of feeling about the whole thing. This lack of emotion is the main characteristic of this man as we follow him through his ordinary, uninteresting life. He has a girlfriend who he admits that not only doesn't he love her, but thinks the question is meaningless. He agrees to mary her if that's what she wants. He befriends a man in his apartment building who leads a seedy life as a pimp and admits he has no reason to be his friend but also no reason not to. Eventually this leads to a confrontation with some Arab men who are after his friend and he shoots one of them. The second half of the book describes his time in jail and with his lawyer and his trial. <br /> <br />This book is basically Camus's philosophy of life in novel form. He does not believe that God exists, so therefore our lives are based purely on our actions. We have complete control over whether we do something or don't and either way there is no meaning to it. If you subscribe to this thinking, you would probably enjoy the book. For me, I couldn't get much joy from it because I disagree with the main character's thinking. There is so much mundanity in the book. I'm sure it was written this way to show you the meaninglessness of this man's life, but it doesn't make for interesting reading. I'm glad I read it, but I don't think much of it.
0440418569|4.0|When I first read this I was much younger and although I did not immediately recognize Pullman's intense anti-religious undertones, I eventually did come to the conclusion that Pullman was using his novel as a means of communicating to the reader that religion, primarily Christianity, was bad thing. <br /> <br />Now much older and nearly five years later, after re-reading the book upon hearing about the His Dark Material's stage verision, I came to basically the same conclusion...except not really. What Pullman really does fail to do is persuade the believers or whatever you prefer to call them that their religion is evil. Albeit, the entire book is propaganda for anti-religion yet the underlying themes discussed in the books almost overpower his beliefs. But then again, if you look a little closer, the whole Christian religion in the series really was...evil. Tortures, wars, killings...there's reason to be anti. But I can see why people have been offended as to where he's drawn the line. <br /> <br />The themes including innocence vs. experiance, coming of age and the young and sexuality, are beautifully described. I'm not trying to give anything away (but seriously, how obvious is it?) but the theme especially of innocence developing into sexuality almost overpowers the fact that Pullman is a walking anti-religion ad. The way the characters are described, falling in love and...well, interacting defiently does improve the overall likeablitity of the book. But then again, if one were to look at all his anti-religion reference, I could defiently see how the sex thing could be looked at as another rebellion-against-God sort of thing. <br /> <br />Besides this, the character development is also really strong. By the end I was nearly in tears (which says a lot because I've never cried after reading a book) and although the ending was sappy, the way the reader comes to grow with the characters seriously cannot prepare him/her for the eventual conclusion. Sure, those whoread in between the lines could have seen it coming from a mile away...but the fact that it actually happened to some of the most amazingly developed characters...sad, huh? <br /> <br />Despite Pullman's great writing ability, there is still a lot of confusion. The final battle that he had been building up since book one between Lyra and the authority never really did happen. It was more the idea of it that was more implied. To bring it up again, page after page is anti religion propaganda and it really does bring a downer to the book. The part where Lyra and Will enter the land of the dead is so painfully and sadly (like depressing kind of sad) written that I really wanted to skip that segement of the book.  <br /> <br />Overall, Pullman's strong beliefs overpower the entire novel (page after page...seriously), but the underlying themes between Lyra and Will are just too irrestible to put down. You may be in a daze...a confused mess after reading this. Maybe even a little angry, depending on your beliefs. But because I'm a sucker for romances and I just really loved the entire series as a whole, I'm rewarding this with four stars. For those who can easily ignore his strong beliefs - enjoy. But for everybody else - read with caution. <br />
B00006L7XQ|5.0|First time I ever heard Johnny Cash was when \\"Man Comes Around\\" played during the credits of a movie. I realized from the words that this was by a man who had a real depth of character and faith. I never liked music at all (never owned a CD), but within a month of listening to Man Comes Around I had bought 7 of Cash's albums including all the American Recordings.

0060977493|5.0|Roy has a great skill at defining her own language.  The novel is a bit difficult to follow in the beginning but once the reader learns the names of the people and places, it is exciting and insanely beautiful.  THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS jumps right into Indian culture and tells the story of a set of two egg twins.  This book is written just as a person remembers their past....in bits and pieces.  It is often difficult to write in this fashion, but Roy is a master at it.

The message the book conveys is simple, you deserve a real man, a real relationship.  The title says it all.    [...]
B0006399FS|4.0|While U2 does explore some songs that sound  a bit like 'early U2' and therefore a bit nostalgic, overall I found this to be an experience as much as an album that has moments of great thought without being overly melodramatic and with a real touch of fun in Vertigo that revs up the trip!!!   <br />\\"Hola\\" boys!  Keep up the good work.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp) is having a hard time finding inspiration until he runs into the recently bereaved children of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet).  In trying to cheer the four boys and their mother up, Barrie opens a door in his own mind---and begins to see pirates and Indians.  Thus, the \\"Peter Pan\\" story is born from his play with the children.   <br /> <br />As time goes on, Barrie's friendship with Davies and her children begins to interfere with his own rocky marriage.  Also, Davies' mother (Julie Christie) is angry that Barrie is taking up the young widow's time when she should be seeking suitors instead.   <br /> <br />Overall, it's a fascinating and enjoyable movie.  I don't know how true to life it is.  I'm not sure I want to find out.  This is one you can take your kids to -- it's real without being too sweet or full of self pity.  Very well done all around.
B000001ESN|5.0|In my opinion, Rush has been pretty consistent since they started out way back in 1974.  Sure, they've undergone some changes (more reliance on synthesizers, etc), but they've always maintained that \\"Rush\\" quality, and \\"Permanent Waves\\" displays that quality better than anything else in their catalog.  Released in 1980, just before their album \\"Moving Pictures\\" firmly implanted synthesizers in their music, \\"Permanent Waves\\" catches Rush at the perfect moment in time.  This album is akin to snapping a photo at the exact right moment in life. <br /> <br />This six-song album starts off with \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" (still one of their biggest songs), then continues with \\"Freewill,\\" \\"Jacob's Ladder,\\" \\"Entre Nous,\\" \\"Different Strings,\\" and ends with \\"Natural Science.\\"  There isn't a bad song on here, and at only six songs, it's easy to enjoy this over and over.  \\"The Spirit of Radio,\\" \\"Freewill,\\" and \\"Entre Nous\\" are classic rock radio staples, and each holds up well over repeated listenings.  \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" finds the band at possibly their heaviest, then they segue into a space-y synthesized bridge.  This is one of my favorite songs in the Rush catalog.  \\"Different Strings\\" is a quiet, relatively somber song, and \\"Natural Science\\" is a typically progg-y tune from this band.  Like I said, this album was sort of a crossroads for Rush, finding them smack in the middle of their first stage (proggy with extended song suites like \\"2112\\") and their second stage (more synthesizers, more individual tracks like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\"). <br /> <br />If you're starting out your Rush collection, you'd probably go for a greatest hits package (\\"Chronicles\\" or \\"The Spirit of Radio\\") or \\"Moving Pictures\\" since that has all the hits, but don't overlook this one.  It's a good foundation to either start moving backwards in time, or forwards through their synth period.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay is huge. There is no denying that fact. All three of their albums have been in the iTunes top 100 for a month and don't show any signs of dropping off. X&Y is still at the top of every album chart in the world, and speed of sound (for some reason) gets a ton of airplay. I'm not one of those people who dislikes coldplay because of their status, or one of those people who hates mainstream music because they think it makes them look cool. I got the album, despite not being a coldplay fan (actually my friend gave it to me but same thing). I have listened to it through enough times to recall the songs and melodies, and have completely fallen in love with the fourth track on this album \\"Fix You\\" Fix you is an excellent song by any standards, most of all compared to others songs by coldplay. The song features an organ, some excellent lyrics, chris martin's best vocals to date, and a completely awesome guitar 2 minutes into the song. It had a major effect on me, and i couldn't stop listening to it. It actually took me a day to listen to the entire album because I kept having to replay this song.     Sadly however, nothing else on the album even comes close to this. Most of the songs are solid pieces of pop/rock. This however is the problem. All the songs with the exception of \\"Fix You\\" are just good, not great, and certainly not perfect or innovative. Most of the songs sound ridiculously similar, and sometimes will just run together without having any real effect. \\"The hardest part\\" never gets anywhere, and ends up sounding like a watered down version of \\"yellow\\". \\"Speed of sound\\" the lead off single, is by far the worst song on the album. Its basically a boring rehash of clocks with crappy lyrics. Seriously, when your chorus is this cheesy:    \\"Birds go flying at the speed of sound   To show you how it all began   Birds came flying from the underground   If you could see it then you'd understand\\"    you need to go back and rewrite it. Its alright for the first fewlistens, but the mediocrity shows pretty quickly.     The other main problem is many of the songs go on for much longer than they need to. \\"White shadows\\" goes on for about five minutes before it reaches the best part, and could have easily been trimmed a minute or so. The first two tracks are good but could have been trimmed as well, as what if is far too slow and not interesting enough to last as long as it does. This problem remains throughout the entire album, as the band surges through tracks like \\"talk\\", \\"a message\\", and \\"low\\", tracks that you hear, but have no emotional effect or connection whatsoever. The first few listens its fresh and exciting, but it wears thin before long and the tracks just keep going. No song on this album is under the four minute mark, and more than half of them are over five minutes.     The band finally finds themselves on the last three songs and finally deliver some excellent music. \\"Swallowed in the sea\\" takes things back to what made the band popular in the first place. However, it's over far too quickly. \\"Twisted Logic\\" is practically made for a cliffhanger scene in a movie or TV because thats exactly what it is. A \\"Cliffhanger\\". After countless failed ballads, its nice to have a more mysterious and darker song to close out the album. The bonus track \\"til kingdom come\\" is perhaps the simplest thing on the album. An acoustic tune that martin wrote for the late johnny cash. Its simple, its small, and it's one of the best things on the album. Who knows, maybe coldplay were never meant to get this big.    MY big problem with this is that their are dozens of more talented artists who will never make it big because bands like coldplay are overshadowing everyone. I'm not telling you not to buy this. I thourougly enjoyed it myself, but while you're out buying it pick up some records by a man named butch walker. An incredible musician. In my opinion, coldplay are a far cry from the greatest band of all time, and this album isnt one ofmy favorites of 2005, but songs like \\"Fix You\\" are incredible enough to get it pretty darn close. Coldplay fans will love this. Everyone else? You'll have to see for yourself.
0671015206|5.0|I've read this book twice.  I think it is required reading for anyone who wants to accumulate wealth and get out of the rat race.  It was very eye-opening to read about what real millionares do and how they create and maintain their wealth.  Reading this book has inspired me to clean up my debt and start investing.  I especially liked the formula presented for calculating what your net worth should be and whether you are ahead or behind.
0316172324|3.0|Is blink worth thinking about. What do you think. OK. Just do not think.<br /><br />Confused! Well, now you are ready to read the book.<br /><br />Gladwell is a great thinker. He talks of instinctive decision-making process and starts of with how some are better at making snap judgments than others. To justify this, he tried (may be he did not think) on what could be a supportive crutch. Well, he meandered through game theory, probability, neuroscience, rapid cognition. He added a term called `thin slicing' for whatever two cents it was worth.<br /><br />Wow! Lazy bones and quarter brains like me, would just love this exciting piece! If some one who does not know me at all, can so confidently tell that I can take decisions in two-seconds, without thinking, why not!<br /><br />The examples are excellent. They are very diverse from police files, music, marriages, museum, and advertising. Great short stories that could well be a Bollywood flick. (Hmm...may be not! There is no running around trees). Also, one would need to remember how music on page 46 and is related to a police chase in page 256.<br /><br />Well if you are reading Gladwell, you are better off without thinking.<br /><br />Gladwell covers the mastery of thin slicing as a science. Excess information is a bane. Thin slicing can be done if you have practiced for 20+ years, with tons of information analysis. The example is about the two elderly women, who can clearly differentiate and articulate the thousands of flavors of margarine. God must have really given a real great number of taste buds. Quite interesting indeed!<br /><br />This is a very unusual book, well written, makes you think again and again and again. The later part of the book, talks of how split-second decisions have failed. The earlier part talks of how long scientific decisions fail. For heavens, take a stand.<br /><br />I have discussed with people, about this book and they have some extreme opinions. They better have. This book swings between extremities and we lesser humans in general have an aversion to grey areas. Think about it!<br /><br />I am still thinking, on what this book is all about. It is over 60 days, since I have read this book.<br />Is it airy nothing or is it the essence of life.<br />Is it an attempt by Gladwell to make some money without readers thinking;<br />or is it an attempt to have readers make money without thinking.<br /><br />Yes, snap judgments are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.<br />Yes, our analyzed judgments are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.<br />Moreover, yes, the more the experience, better is our ability to make either of these judgments.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell communicates the above three sentences extremely well using in the 288 page book using 4,172 sentences, 71,276 words and 412,533 characters.<br /><br />Well worth a read.<br /><br />(...)n to grey areas.

B000001F9N|4.0|Her 2nd domestic release- not a bad one either, though it dosen't have the brilliant album concept like 'Four Seasons of Love' does.  What is the meaning of Love Trilogy and how do these tracks apply to the theme??  Who knows.  Still, a fabulous set of tunes, all very disco-oriented.  The best of course being Try Me, I Know We Can Make It...an 18-minute ORIGINAL masterpiece that has been shortened to 3-4 minutes on succeeding releases. In second comes Could It Be Magic (both the prelude and main song.)  The other two tracks Wasted and Come With Me are passable bonuses to the album.  Excellent for Donna Summer and disco fans.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Other than Johnny Depp, I have no idea why I love this movie. The music is cheesy, the acting is cheesy, even the storyline is cheesy. BUT I LOVE IT! Weird? Probably not. And I'm sure alot of people here would agree with me. This thing is a cult classic that will continue on for years to come. If you want something fun to watch and to relax your brain from the dramas from the real and crazy world, then this is the movie for you!  <br /> <br />Go on try it! :)
0060599812|5.0|Every page is full of useful insight that can be used to make you a richer, wiser person in all areas of life.  If I could only have one inspiring business book, this would be it.  Yet Canfield's appendix is full of other great materials for expanding one's library.  Even though I know I will reread the book, I'm getting the abridged tapes for my car today.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Jack Black:  comic genius.  Kyle Gass:  lesser demon.  Together they are Tenacious D.  The beauty of this cd is that there is nothing but filler.  Hilarious, arse-kicking filler.  Track after track, JB and KG serve up a plentiful (probably unhealthy) dose of toilet humor.  Don't miss out on this stripped down rock-n-roll, sketch comedy, CD for pervs.
0805076476|5.0|How many of us space monkeys saw the movie and only then decided to read Mr. Palahniuk's novel?  Robert Stone thought it was, quote, a memorable debut by an important writer.  Oh, yeah, he also said it was, quote, a powerful, dark original novel...\\"  No clue what went on in the ellipsis, though. <br />I find myself thinking that, if you look up nihilism in Webster's, you might just see a picture of Chuck P.  That's a corny way to put it, but then I am usually corny.  And Webster's tends to take the fun out of everything. <br />The truth is in this book.  You have to read the whole thing, but it's there, near the end.  Oh, you could peek at the end, and read the truth, but you won't really get it unless you read the whole book.  You could go into one of those giant book stores that are like Home Depot for semi-literate thought, and they might even let you sit in one of those overstuffed chairs and read the whole thing.  Then, Chuck P. wouldn't get his royalty, and I really think he should. <br />If you liked the film, and you haven't read the book, then please do so.  It's all in the book, and more, slightly different in form, but then, what's an artist for? <br />If you didn't like the film, or haven't seen it, you should still read the book, though you probably won't.  You are probably reading this review to see if it is more clever than the one you wrote (rote?).  It isn't, though I believe there (their?) are fewer grammatical mistakes. <br />I am amusing myself.  What if that is what Chuck P. was doing here, just putting on nihilism like a team jacket, something you buy rather than earn?  Yet, I still believe Chuck has earned the royalties.  Slide.  Slide! <br />Get the synopsis from other reviews, and then check that this review didn't help you.  Why would you think it would? <br />I plan to check the box that says I am over the age of 13.  I am certain that this is true in the physical sense (by just over 300% if you do math). <br />\\"We're going to the medicalwaste dump.\\"  Yes, indeed
B000002UAO|1.0|In my Life and Michelle are good songs. Giving the beatles credit. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is Garbage.
B00009V7P8|5.0|If you read all 240 some-odd reviews and you got to this one, congratulations on your dedication.  I consider myself a very avid music fan and like to like that which others don't in order to make myself feel cool, but unfortunately, no matter how hard i try, I can't make myself dislike this album.  I have been learning to play guitar and sing now for some time and the highest praise i can give Damien and \\"O\\" is that they make me want to quit right now.  I know i could never achieve anything half as perfect as this album.   I have  several hundred CD's and if I had to choose just 5 to continue with, this one would be the first I would go for.  It is a humbling, beautiful experience.  Cant say enough....
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the most amazing books I've ever read. It was the most honest book I've ever read. The emotions and feelings and experiences that Charlie goes through are ones that every teenager goes through. I liked that fact that Charlie was so unapologetic about himself. He wrote what he felt and wasn't ashamed of it. It is one of the truest depictions of teenagers' experiences and emotions that I have ever read. I'd like to thank Spephen Chbosky for writing such a beautiful book. If you are reading this, unsure if you should buy this book, I strongly encourage you to. You will not be disappointed.
B00005JM0B|4.0|First you had the Terminator in 1984, than there was Terminator 2: Judgement Day in 1991, now there was Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003.  <br />This movie is one of those movies you just have to see after seeing the first two. It is a great action movie, with great special effects and fights. The only thing that is missing in this wild picture, is the darkness that James Cameron brought to the first two Terminator Films. There is more humor and everything looks way more colourfull than it was in the first two films.  <br />But besides the missing darkness, the third Terminator movie is great! It could have been better in some perspectives, but it is a good continuation of the story.  <br /> <br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is back once again as the Terminator. He does it once again with the coolness and style that was in the last two films.  <br />Nick Stahl plays John Connor, and does a great job. You feel the fear he still has of Judgement day and his nightmares. <br />Claire Danes playes Kate Brewster, a vet that gets stuck in the situations of John and Terminator. She also knows who to show her character in a way that is needed for the film to work. <br />Kristanna Loken is here, after Robert Patricks great part in T2 as the Terminatrix, the T-X and does it fantasticly! She keeps her face in one line the whole time, which makes her a very believable and feared Terminator. And she really knows how to kick some butt. <br /> <br />Conclusion: A great Terminator movie that completes another chapter in the Terminator timeline.  <br />But if you haven't seen the first two, it is also a great action-film to watch.
B00000DHRX|1.0|The content of this CD is like a Ferris Wheel --- you get the same thing over and over and over and over again.  Every song sounds like the one before and after it.  So monotonous!  Don't bother!!
B0006IIKS0|4.0|It's difficult enough to talk to family about feelings, let along Metallica, arguably one of the most famous heavy metal band in the world.  Four years ago, prior to issuing their St Anger album, the band was heading towards an implosion, which would slowly but definitely choke the band to death.  The bass player by the name of Jason walked out.  The morale among the group was an all-time low, particularly between the drummer, Lars and the lead singer, James.  The coming of this documentary was accidental too as the Directors only meant to get publicity shoots for the music studio but later, they realised that they got a winner in their hand.  A coach was engaged to facilitate open discussions among the band members and that's when the fun began.  Many times viewing through the documentary, I had to remind myself that they were heavy metal music players and yet, they tried to be constructive and determined to fix their problems.  As James said in one of the excerpts, they knew they had a problem and they decided that a therapy would be imperative to bring them on-track.  Good on them!  There were funny moments (not intended to be funny but just happened to be coming out that way) such as James attending his daughter's ballet class, Kirk (the lead guitarist) showing them band members his skull collections and celebrating his 40th birthday and Lars getting jealous (oversensitive) for not been told before hand about the theme, et cetera.  There were also poignant moments such as James talking candidly about his dynfunctional family, there were spontaneous moments such as the band showing up prior to Raiders match and gave a performance of their lifetime at the parking lot and the list goes on.  Towards the end, you would identify every and each of them on first name basis.  It's really intriguing watching how St Anger got made, receptiveness of Metallica embracing other genre such as hip-hop as they jammed with Ja Rule and so forth.  An honest documentary that portrayed that even superfamous people like themselves are human afterall and it's really respecting to see them admitting to their faults and dealing with them in stride.  DVD is a must-have.  I watched this documentary in the cinema only to find out that there were hours and hours of extras (more intimate and funny scenes) in the compilation.  Highly recommended.
B0009A40ES|5.0|they relese a film expecting people to buy some uncut killers version without mentioning it doesnt have anything extra on it.  it only replaces the stuff cut in the U.S. (the word hole is very bothering to yanks it seems) and bump up the price.  even amazons own site says its a minute shorter than the original (its not its about 10 seconds longer) <br /> <br />just buy the english one (althogh it is lacking features and has a terrible front cover) its only 5.99 most places <br /> <br />p.s. this is a good film from an amazing book,  read the book,  watch the film, love the violence
0736041850|5.0|This book does a great job of describing the different exercises.  I think it could do a better job of warning about the possible back injuries associated with some of the exercises, but other than that its a great book.

B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana doesn't sound like Black Flag. Kurt was too doped up on poppies when he wrote the Sub Pop bio of his band where he says Nirvana sounded like the Bay City Rollers and Black Flag. Henry Rollins specifically said so. He also stated he doesn't want to be associated with such a \\"classic\\" Grunge group who abused drugs like the band members of Nirvana did. I find it funny and insanely hypocritical that a junkie like Kurt Cobain idolozed a STRAIGHT EDGE musician such as Rollins. Rollins even said that someone who poisons their body with drugs and alcohol deserves the damage they do to themselves. <br /> <br />Go buy a Black Flag's DAMAGED instead of Nevermind's Pop bullsh*t <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|First things first:  I write this review from a neutral stance.  I am not a flag-waving gun, toting patriot, nor am I a Moore-esque radical leftist.  I, if anything sit slightly on the liberal side of political neutrality.  That being said, there are a few things to know.  First and without exception, when watching any Michael Moore Movie, you need to know a few things.  Moore generally knows what he is talking about, but tends to show only one side of the issue in question.  Second, he likes to exaggerate the truth.  He doesn't outright lie, but he doesn't give it to you straight.  Not by a long shot.  You need to kick everything that comes out of his mouth down a couple of notches, to make up for his inflation of the issue.  This goes for every film he has ever done.  Let's face it.  Very few people have the same views on our country, G.W. Bush, Iraq, Foreign Policy, or our Armed Forces as Moore does.  Moore is an extremist, and comes off a bit too opinionated and radical for some Americans to handle in one sitting.  If you keep an open mind and do your homework on the issues at hand though, Farhrenheit 9/11 provides an interesting look at our advances overseas in the past few years, and our practices here in our own country.  Moore tells you not to believe all that you see on TV, and he is right.  The same statement goes for him, as well, though. If you watch this film and and think either \\"Oh, I love George W, so that movie sucked,\\" or \\"Oh I hate Bush and that was awesome\\", you are doing yourself an injustice.  Open-mindedness and reason need to be implemented when you watch this film for yourself.   <br /> <br />The Final Word - I recommend that you see this film only if you are smart enough to handle it.   Leave your own political views at the door and take it for what it is, a movie made by a man who sees problems around him and wants to see something done about it.   Three and a half stars overall.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I am a huge Sarah fan.  And I didn't really get into her music untill I heard this album.  It is truly amazing.  My favorite song is \\"Fallen.\\" I have all of her albums...but this one comes first.  The lyrics are amazing, and you can hear the emotion that went on while she composed this album.  Fans will not be dissappointed, and newcomers should try this album.  I also recommend the albums \\"Surfacing\\" and \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,\\" for anyone who is just starting.  I gave this cd five stars, because it is absolutely worthy of them.  Here is a break down of this briliantly seductive album    Fallen- 5/5  World on Fire- 4.5/5  Stupid- 5/5  Drifting- 5/5  Train Wreck- 4.5/5  Push- 5/5  Answer- 4.5/5  Time- 5/5  Perfect Girl- 5/5  Dirty Little Secret- 5/5
B00005JNJT|4.0|I loved \\"Batman Begins\\" overall, especially because it stays true to its title and focuses on Batman's origins. It is also very dark and brings Batman back to his brooding film noirish roots. Christopher Nolan was an ideal choice for director given his film noir past with \\"Memento\\" \\"Insomnia\\" and \\"Following\\", but I suspect that a well-trained dog could have turned in a better effort than \\"Batman and Robin.\\" (\\"Batman Forever\\" was an OK change of pace, and fit Jim Carrey, it doesn't deserve to be lumped in the same category as it's successor.)  <br /> <br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is a near perfect film, though I think it took a terrible wrong-turn in its closing minutes. SPOILER ALERT! While it is true that both of Burton's efforts could stand to go a shade or two darker, who dares to take on Jack Nicholson's \\"Joker\\"? Why go into head-to-head competition with a pretty good film when you have the opportunity to correct utter garbage like \\"Batman and Robin\\" ? Mr. Freeze deserves better than the Governator and Poison Ivy was perfectly cast, and should have been given more to do than fight like a Power-Ranger.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I never know what to expect from a Batman movie.  Some of them seem more action-oriented than suits my taste, but they're almost always entertaining in one way or another.  This one is one of the best, in my opinion, because the back-story is blended in with the action without diluting it, as well as a good deal of philosophy about the difference between justice and revenge, which interests me, and unfortunately is still not resolved.  I wonder if there's a website somewhere discussing the topic.  Anyway, what holds all this together is not good plotting, but talent from all directions - lotsa good stars - Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Michael Caine, Katie Homes, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, others.  I never used to like Michael Caine until he got older, and changed my mind probably when he did Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin.  I've liked him more in each movie since, and he's outstanding as Alfred the butler in this one.  The rest of the cast performs to their usual high standards as well.  If you're familiar with Batman at all, the plot won't have any big surprises for you, but a few fun small ones that fill in the story.  All in all, it's one of the best movies I've seen this year, recommended for Batman fans as much as for those who've never read a comic book or seen a Batman movie before.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Much like Warner Bros. used Christopher Nolan to overhaul the Dark Knight, they have also overhauled the film's score, which thankfully, is unlike anything ever heard in a Batman film.  Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard have crafted something that rivals Danny Elfman's classic score, and in many cases even surpasses it.  At times, Zimmer seems to be channeling the bombasticness of his King Arthur score, but with collaborating with Howard, Batman Begins' score is unusualy subtle, and it works.  A clever use of the disc's score titles (named after different types of bats) is a nice touch, with standouts including \\"Myotis\\", \\"Barbastella\\", \\"Macrotus\\", and \\"Molossus\\", while \\"Tadarida\\" perfectly captures the atmosphere of the film with some nightmarish pounding and distortion.  Just like the film, Warner Bros. really tried to do this right, and just like the film, it succeeds incredibly.
6305949980|5.0|How can you hate this movie? It's a classic.<br /><br />Story: Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween town, Has a little plot he's up to: To Bring Christmas to halloweentown.

Then after Xmas this year, my sis bought it on DVD. It's a must own!<br /><br />So this is a must own, and if you dont own it, then go buy it!
B0006L16N8|4.0|*Note: barely over 13* <br />I remember hearing speed of sound on the radio (through the computer, since I don't live in the UK where coldplay is so popular) and having to switch to another station until it ended, thinking \\"I just can't stand this kind of song!!\\". I was ready to strangle whoever this band's vocalist is. <br /> <br />Then I heard it again, and again, and again, and couldn't get enough. I just had to buy the CD, and I wasn't dissapointed. It's the kind of music you have to be in the right mood for. I sit in the dark, at night, with head-phones on, (call me insane, or manic depressive, you're probably right) and just listen. It's touching music. Not especially deep, but if you just devote your full atention to it, without over-analizing the lyrics, its just beautiful. period. <br /> <br />I'm not a die-hard fan who wants to like the CD just because its Coldplay, I just like the music. I reccomend it to anyone who is willing to give it a chance, but be warned: the first time I heard the songs on X&Y I hated them, but each slowly grew on me, and now X&Y has to be my favorite album. When I'm in the mood.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Once the excitement of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson's return had washed off people, they started ignoring Iron Maiden again... So here it is... Maiden's attempt to produce a new \\"Brave New World\\". This is more interesting than the latter because it is more adventurous but still badly over-produced. Now they actually found a use for three bloody guitars and created masterpieces such as \\"Rainmaker\\", \\"No More Lies\\" and the magnificent title track which still makes me dance.
1573223026|5.0|Despite dealing with what you would assume is dark subject matter, Nick Hornby's A Long Way Down is a quick read filled with original characters-- perfect for a few lazy summer hours. <br /> <br />The most appealing part of Hornby's fourth novel is how he has thrown together four people that, before attempting suicide, wouldn't have been able to stand each other. It was interesting to follow their plots and plans to make money off of their experience and stay together as a group. <br /> <br />It should be mentioned that A Long Way Down is one of the funnier books of the summer, which is a plus in my book. Many of the laughs come when Hornby writes as casually-speaking teenager Jess. <br /> <br />If you want a book that will keep you well entertained for a day or two, A Long Way Down is the way to go.
B00008WT5C|5.0|The international version of \\"High Voltage\\" was a hit... yes but then AC/DC steped all over it with \\"Let There Be Rock\\", the loudest, fastest record of their career. The brillant Bon Scott is here at his best... Just listen to the way he shouts \\"LETTHEREBEROCK!!!!\\". The songs are so heavy that Angus' amplifier cought fire halfway through the recording of the title-track. <br />All the tracks just spit fire. No record collection is complete without this album.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I've been waiting a long time for the new Foo Fighters double album, and I've been listening to Best Of You in a cycle since May. Was I let down? No. Is the album perfect? No. Does it really matter? NO WAY! <br /> <br />My favorite disk would have to be the first, the \\"hot\\" one as the studio would put it. Best of You and DOA are most definately classics, and many others are close. As much as I like the second disk, it just isn't as good as the first. As another reviewer said-- think of it as a bonus album. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the Foo Fighters or rock in general, you'll enjoy this (and probably the acoustic version, too).
B0008GNJZY|4.0|I thought this movie was a very good one.  I thought the cast was an excellent pick.  And i must say that even though I'm not an Ashanti fan, I thought she did very good with her acting.  Maybe she should stick with that than singing.  Of course Sam Jackson was great in this movie.  He's a very good actor anyway so it didn't make much of a difference.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi has been on my \\"gotta read it someday\\" list for over two years now. I really wish that I had read this masterpiece sooner. Yann Martel's retelling of another man's experience is something I won't be forgetting anytime soon. <br /> <br />I won't be giving away the twist in the book, but suffice to say that there is one. The writing is beautiful and really let me in on what it was like for Pi Patel to go through such a unique young life as he did. Martel's descriptions of India, the Pacific, and Pi's later home are quite detailed.  <br /> <br />If you don't take away anything else from this review, just remember: READ LIFE OF PI!
B000089CJI|5.0|Give Up by The Postal Service is a great album.  It has 80's textured synthesizer melodies with post grunge song structure.  The lyric content isn't original but a nice breather from the pessimistic millennium rockers, the pop princesses, and the hip-hop wanna-be's.  This album has a huge replay value, and makes an interesting addition to anyone's rock and/or pop CD collection.  This CD is worth every penny.
1593974256|5.0|This product arrived shrinkwrapped and in perfect condition.  I couldn't have asked for anything better at such a great price.
B000002BBY|4.0|This is a good cd it sounds like a cross of course of the beatles and david bowie who i like so combining the two is a good idea. The only complaint though is the Liam's voice it is not so hot actually Noel has a better voice but that is not saying much. One thing why did Noel who writes all the songs have his brother join he could have very well been the lead singer. If someone with a good voice like David Bowie were to sing on this cd then this would be one of the best cds of the 90s .
B0007P3582|3.0|This album is pretty much 22 tracks of solid music. As a whole it's not better than 'Get Rich', but if you break down the album, 'The Massacre' as more standout songs. The best songs here include \\"Gatman & Robbin\\" w/ Eminem, \\"Ski Mask Way\\"(best song overall), \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\", \\"Ryder Music\\" and the \\"Hate it ir Love It\\" remix\\". You can pretty much listen to tracks 5 through 14 nonstop, but I dont even acknowledge 13-21. <br /> <br />**By the way, to Sick Juggalo, Em destroys Esham, so don't even play. And, nobody likes ICP, they cant cut it in wrestling nor rap, so get over it. You wanna hear GOOD horrorcore rap--try Necro, Ill Bill, or Blaze Ya Dead Homie, they'll eat ICP alive.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Josh gorban has the most boring voice i ever heard it is so perfect pristene and boring. I would like this sissy to show some emotion when he sings. This guy is popular becasue middle age house wifes and lonely old hags like his boring music. Also this guy is in his early 20s why does he sound like he is 60. Old ladies there is better music out there but this review would be longer than war and peace if i were to name all of them
B0001I55OC|1.0|Acting is standard, story is very predictable, the science is lame, cheap special effects. Crichton and Donner bombed on this one. Time for a \\"Westworld\\" remake, I think. <br /> <br />Buy \\"THE FINAL COUNTDOWN\\" instead, much better film!
B000002UAU|4.0|This is an important cd to own but it is not the best of them let alone of all time. There are great songs on this album like She's leaving home, When i'm 64, For the Benfit of Mr. kite, lovlely rita, and of course there best song to me a day in the life for these songs alone it is a must have. But there is bad songs on here like the title song both of versions, lucy in the sky with diamonds which is so anoying to me. The other songs are listenable but nothing to rave about.
B000088E6D|1.0|I can see right now that my viewpoint is the minority one. Have all those reviewers who have given this CD five stars ever heard the originals of the songs that Buble' covers? I borrowed this CD from a friend who bought it to see what all the hoo-ha over Buble' was about and I could not believe my ears as he destroyed song after song. Compare him to Sinatra and Darin? You have to be kidding! <br />OK, Buble' does have a pleasant voice, and the generic swing band that backs him is at least competent. But Buble' has no feel for the songs he sings, his renditions are utterly lifeless. Why would anyone want to hear covers of songs that are much better in the original? <br />I urge those of who think this is a great album to seek out the originals ( try Van Morrison's Moondance, for example) and compare them with Buble's blasphemies. He dishonors lots of artists, great and not so great, with this pitiful and pretentious dreck. Once you hear how the songs should sound, the Buble' bandwagon will come to a grinding halt.
B00006LLNU|4.0|This is a great chill out cd to listen to if you really do not want to think much. All of the lyrics as you probably already know are in Icelandic. This sounds like classical music with an alterantive rock twist to me. The songs blend together so none of these songs stands out. The plus side is that the singer has a decent voice and it is pretty but it does not impress me like  when i listen to ok computer or other better cds that this cd sounds like.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Where has this movie been all my life? In the opening trailer for focus features it says, \\"If we live in such a diverse world, then why are so many movies the same?\\"  THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is not your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy.   <br /> <br />Joel Barish finds out that his girlfriend of two years, Clementine, has had him earased from her memory.  Feeling that it will be too painful to live without her he decides that he wants the same procedure done.  About half-way through the erasing he realizes that he doesn't want to forget Clementine and attempts to hide her which makes for some excellent comic relief. <br /> <br />The good points to this movie are the way that Joel is inside his own head.  As the erasing begins Joel feels like he is inside his own head and it feels surreal at first, but he soon starts having angry conversations with Clementine, screaming, \\"I'm earasing you, you know, by tommorrow you'll be gone.\\" <br /> <br />The acting in this movie is also suburb.  You have Kate Winslet as the free-spirited wild child, and Jim Carey, in what may be his best role yet.  Jim Carey is the quiet boyfriend to Clementine who keeps a journal of all his thoughts.   <br /> <br />Overall this movie is amazing, well put together, and has an amazing plot that will blow viewers away.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am just going to rate each song on the cd: <br /> <br />1. Air Bag /8 <br />2. Paranoid Android /9 <br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien/9 <br />4. Exit Music for a Film/10 <br />5.

0312323859|5.0|This book was amazing just as \\"Somethng Borrowed\\" was amazing.  I just finished college and the last thing I wanted to do was read more books but, after choosing \\"Something Borrowed\\" on a whim, and finishing it in a week...I knew that I needed to read \\"Something Blue\\".  Emily Giffin is an extremely talented writer and I cannot wait to see what else she has in store for Rachel, Darcy, Dex, and Ethan.
B000006O7C|3.0|I bought this cd after i listen to Grace which i like a whole lot and i wanted an other cd by him. There are good songs on here espeically the ballads but some of these songs are embrassing. The songs on the second cd are even worse. You should just download songs from this cd like satisfied mind, you and I and a couple others but most of it is a waste. If you like jeff why not try his dad out Tim Buckley happy/sad is pretty good. Another sugestion if you like jeff's voice is Travis's The Man Who. And one more thing can they stop coming out with cds by Jeff most it is unfinished and if he was still alive he would probably think that his after death releases suck.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia Keys is a talented artist, nobody can take that away from her. However, I got this album and her 1st and just really got to listen and appreciate her music! <br />I was an R&B fan but didn't appreciate old school flavor (What was I thinking?\\") I only listened to her singles but my eyes opened. <br />The Diary of Alicia Keys is a soulful journey for fans of good R&B music. The album creates a great atmosphere thanks to Alicia's skillz on her piano. Alicia Keys vocals may not be on Mariah, Christina, or Beyonce's but it isn't necessary. Alicia doesn't have to use a lot of runs or show her voice to get her point across. She creates a mood with her songs that pull you into pain, joy, or urgency of some situation. <br />This album is very consistent and soulful, something many artist don't do... and she writes all her songs! <br />My favorite joints have to be: Diary, If Ain't got you, KArma, You don't know my name, So Simple,and Slow Down. <br />Kudos to Alicia for daring to step out the box and realize you don't have to oversing or do complex dance steps to establish yourself as an artist!
B000026X05|5.0|When Love You Live was released, it had been almost seven years since their last live album was released. There was supposed to have been a live recording of the 1972 tour, but that was squashed for legal reasons. The legal restriction from releasing songs recorded for their previous record company expired June 30th, and Love You Live came out in October. <br /> <br />With the exception of the El Mocambo club side, Love You Live was an accurate representation of the '75-'76 tour. Hard rockers mixed with a few slow songs made for a very listenable experience. After Ya Ya's, my second favorite live Stones album.
0743544676|3.0|Making him look bad is not necessarily making you feel better...It is a  book that brings sadness and stress. I am the tpye of person who prefer a soft way...so it is not the right book for me...
B0007RT9LW|4.0|A lot of people say that the 1974 version of this movie was better, filled with more action & had raw feel about it. True. But I wasn't growing up then, hence the cars, the actors & the scenes were not from my generation & so I like the new one.<br /><br />Besides the above the \\"Elenor\\" Car chase scene was 40 minutes in the original & only 20-odd minutes in this one which is a good thing because today's fickle audience will not sit through 40 minutes run-around leave alone anything else.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage did a pretty convincing job as \\"Memphis\\" a car thief who does it for the thrill & because allegedly the cars beg to be stolen & not for gain or glory. Nobel eh! Modern day Robin Hood.<br /><br />The lovely Angelina Jolie had a miniscule role in this movie -more eye candy than anything else- & did not actually contribute but she's still lovely isn't she?<br /><br />I was told by a friend that I am not a \\"real chase movie watchers\\" well, thank God is what I say. If I led such a monotonous life I would surely die. Besides that's what PS2 is for - harebrained car chases that can last longer than 8 to 10 hours.<br /><br />Verdict: Overall I think the movie struck a decent balance between remaking a classic & living in the moment. A good movie to watch over & over again-ish.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars for a creditable performance & being as true as possible to the original without loosing any integrity.
0441012906|2.0|Man, this one just didn't do it for me. Bear in mind, I *like* Reynolds - I devoured \\"Revelation Space,\\" \\"Redemption Ark,\\" even the turgid and unsatisfying \\"Absolution Gap,\\" and was looking forward to seeing what he could do with a slipstream/counterfactual plot. <br /> <br />What have we here? Thin characterization, endless, tension-free chase sequences, and (surprisingly) lotsa pseudoscience. What I liked about Reynold's earlier work was the way he let nanotechnology, exotic-physics propulsion systems, and alien contact produce recognizably human cultural responses - but in \\"Century Rain\\" he's given us a mysterious, ancient \\"hyperweb\\" of wormholes interconnecting star systems throughout the galaxy, and it's the least interesting thing in the book! It barely figures in the plot except as an excuse to get us to and from the alternate history of \\"E2.\\" <br /> <br />I dunno, man. Baxter's Manifold books did this better. Hell, even Carl Sagan did it better - and with less mumbo-jumbo around the physics of it. <br /> <br />Worse, Reynolds here commits the fatal error of cuteness. The wildly technophile Slasher culture derives its name and outlook from \\"a certain Web community of the late twentieth century\\" (ack), and there are at least three gratuitous in-jokes turning on famous lines from \\"Casablanca\\" - \\"stick my neck out,\\" \\"beautiful friendship,\\" and \\"Paris.\\" (Don't get me wrong: I adore \\"Casablanca,\\" but this ain't the place to celebrate it.) <br /> <br />In summary: this almost feels like a piece of juvenilia acquired and published after the success of the \\"Revelation Space\\" books. I'm not ready to write Reynolds off just yet, but I'm afraid \\"Century Rain\\" has knocked him off my auto-buy list.
0553573403|4.0|A Game of Thrones, the first book of the Song of Ice and Fire trilogy, is a well-written work.  The descriptive writing is layered and rich, intertwining with a fairly complex plot.  Martin pulls off the essentials of fantasy well: strong world building, unique characters, and sudden plot twists signposted by subtle foreshadowing.  If you're going to tackle this novel, be prepared for the deaths of key characters.  Clearly, George Martin likes to kill off main characters so as to keep you on your toes.  Also, he relies heavily on a Medieval influenced background where ladies are ladies and men are knights, with only the occasional female character choosing the sword.  However, his characters leap from the page, and he sets up their internal action/thought in poetic fashion.  Overall, worth the read.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Sufjan has stated that he wants to write a broadway musical one day.  Well, this is his warm-up.  Great pop melodies abound, but there is an overall broadway feel to this c.d. which is remarkable.  At its very worst, Illinoise can slide into \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" type of lyrics.  But, for the most part, the c.d. is wonderfully full of stories that make you feel joy and sadness.  The song about the girl with bone cancer (bone marrow?) is one of Sufjan's best and most chilling songs.  This is an epic, remarkable musical journey.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman's had a rough ride in the movie business.  He started out all right-you might argue that Batman launched the current craze of translating comic books to movies.  But before the Hulk, Spiderman, Daredevil, and the X-Men came to the big screen, Batman had to fight to be taken seriously. Unfortunately, after making strides with the Batman movie by Tim Burton, the franchise slowly lost ground to directors who didn't respect the material, eventually finding its way into the hands Evil Incarnate himself, the bad guy fanboys loathe everywhere: Joel Schumacher.<br /><br />It's not that Schumacher's vision was wrong, because Batman has certainly been campy before (one look at Adam West's television series drives that point home).  It's that Schumacher was making a movie for himself.  Conversations about \\"staying true to the material\\" didn't happen then.  Schumacher did whatever he felt like, and to heck with anybody who disagreed.<br /><br />Like the big dumb animals that movies tend to be, franchises only stop charging down a path when they get seriously wounded.  When Batman & Robin finally, blessedly, flopped in the box office, comic book movies stopped getting made and, unfortunately, Batman along with them.<br /><br />Given that little history lesson, it's understandable that Batman Begins strives very hard to \\"keep it real.\\"  Every character is perfectly cast, from Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, to Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, from Michael Caine as Alfred, to Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon.  The actors, the directors, the studios now take comic-based films very seriously and stock them with the right people...casts that had been only fantasized as \\"dream teams\\" for comic book translations are now regularly realized. Bale has the physique and brooding manner necessary to pull off a believable Batman and an even more believable Wayne.  Freeman has the reserved kindness and intelligence required for Fox.  Caine imbues Alfred with whit and charm as only he can.  And Oldman is both frightened and frail as a lone good cop in a world gone mad.<br /><br />With this newfound respect, Batman Begins starts the franchise all over again by going back to his roots.  And by doing so, in the same way Enterprise helped Star Trek (but alas, could not sustain it), Batman Begins forgives past sins by focusing on the visceral parts of the its protagonist.  There is a gritty realism that serves as a constant reminder that Batman person could exist, from the training Bruce receives from ninjas to how Bruce, Lucius and Alfred conspire to create Batman's suit and Batmobile.<br /><br />Even the villains are carefully weaved through the plot. The Scarecrow is actually Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, creating zombies instead of fighting them this go round), with grandiose plans of psychological experimentation on Gotham City. Ra's Al Ghul, the leader of a shadowy organization that destroys empires, employs Crane.  If there is a high-minded plot point that might lose some members of the audience, it's the ninjas...but man I just love me some ninjas.<br /><br />There are links to Batman history all over the place.  Batman Begins largely follows the events in Batman: Year One, especially when Bruce falls down a hole and is terrorized by a swarm of bats-a fear that, to the writers' credit (Christopher Nolan and David Goyer), is never forgotten even as they amp up the action and violence.  The tank-like form of the Batmobile harkens back to The Dark Knight Returns.  In that regard, Batman succeeds admirably.<br /><br />There's a lot to cover.  The chase scenes are a little too long, and the Rachel Dawes character played by Katie Holmes is almost unnecessary. Still, Batman Begins alternately feels like an urban horror or a dramatic character study.  There is nothing campy or self-parodying here. When Batman strikes, it's horrifying.  When Bruce Wayne manipulates, it's believable.  It's to everyone's credit that there are no jarring transitions between the two worlds.<br /><br />Ultimately, Batman Begins is the platform for a much larger story.  The events in the first movie stage the platform for the next and explain why so many crazies-with-a-theme populate Batman's world.  If the Batman franchise can stray true to this new \\"comic book realism,\\" it will be a joy to watch unfold.  Here's hoping this is just the beginning.ransitions between the two worlds. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Batman Begins is the platform for a much larger story.

B000002BKP|3.0|THAT WAS THE ONLY SONG THAT I ENJOY ON THE ENTIRE CD.
B000002HMH|4.0|In 1996, Metallica had released their long-awaited seventh album entitled, LOAD. I was hoping for another great album, but I did not get that. This album is not as good as Metallica's first six albums. In fact, it is sort of the same as THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. This album does not have any covers, but its success is neck-and-neck with the Garage EP. <br /> <br />AIN'T MY BITCH <br />  Incredible. <br /> <br />2 X 4 <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />UNTIL IT SLEEPS <br />  This is one of the best songs on this album. I cannot help myself when I sing along with this song. <br /> <br />KING NOTHING <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />HERO OF THE DAY <br />  Although, I do love this song, this is not the version I prefer. This studio recorded version is not bad, but there is another version of this song that I prefer. <br /> <br />BLEEDING ME <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />CURE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />POOR TWISTED ME <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />WASTING MY HATE <br />  Sounds so hateful, but I like it. <br /> <br />MAMA SAID <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />THORN WITHIN <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />RONNIE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />THE OUTLAW TORN <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />    As I said before, I am not too crazy about this album. It is good for what it is, but it is not like Metallica's previous albums, with the exception of THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. If you look closely at the album's front cover, you'll notice that what you are seeing is cow's blood mixed in with the sperm of an aid's victim. Yes, it is a rather disgusting front cover, but the front cover is not what you are buying the album for. Also, you'll notice that the guys have stripped themselves of their long hair. Most fans were disappointed in that. I was not disappointed. I mean, I loved the long hair, but I was not disappointed in them cutting their hair because Metal is not measured by the length of your hair. So, buy thisalbum and give it a chance.

B0006SSOHC|3.0|This is a solid-situation thriller as they call it. However, it isn't one in the strict sense of the term as much of the story occurs outside the bathroom where those two chaps are held captive. Of the two it is only Lawrence who is ordered to kill the other, Adam, thus robbing the film of all the psychological interplay that would occur between the two were Adam also  ordered to kill the other, Lawrence. True, I did find myself on the edge of the seat at times, but I found it a bit difficult to identify with this demented mastermind whose motive can only be described as \\"infantile\\", and it is for this reason that all this preaching about \\"how ungrateful we are of the blessings\\" sounds decidedly hollow. This is in no way a bad film but I prefer Cube to this one as the Canadian thriller, based on the Cartesian/Kantian concept, has much more to offer both ethically as well as artistically.

B0000026NC|5.0|When I review live albums, I always judge the sound quality and the sound quality on this effort by Pink Floyd is suberb. The sound production is almost as good as Pat Metheny's live albums. Incredible! \\"One of These Days\\" on disk two is worth listening to twice before continuing on through both disks. I really like the production of the Dark Side of the Moon tracks. A very fine two disk set. David Gilmour's singing is excellent and his guitar techniques are unique in rock music. I didn't realize how good Pink Floyd was in concert until I listened to this LP. Highly recommended.

B0009K7RES|5.0|I'm a huge Knopfler fan, so this review might appear biased to some.  That said, I am generally very happy with this CD.  It's got eight great songs for a cheap price, and it's really nice to be able to hear the \\"rough cut\\" version of some of my favorites.  If you don't like the songs on the CD in the original, produced and polished version, then you probably won't care too much for this LP.  If you are a guitar fan or a Knopfler fan, you will definitely get a kick out of this album.  The rougher texture and simpler background harmonies in this album give certain tracks (\\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" for one) a more intimate and bluesy feel.  Highly recommended!

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This is the first time I ever heard the entire BURN cd. Right off the bat I thought every song was great. Richie's bluesy playing, Ian's druming is at its best, Lordie's keyboard playing is great as always. Coverdale's and Hughes dual singing makes this cd sound so different, so inspired. The only downer about this line is that you know it didn't last long. At least you have this and their follow up, Stormbringer, to listen to.
B00063MBU8|5.0|Ok, let's cut the talk and start reviewing. <br /> <br />1. Shut Up! - 10/10 A great pop music, with good sounds. <br />2. Welcome To My Life - 10/10 My favorite song by Simple Plan. The lyrics are just too good.   <br />3. Perfect World - 8/10 Kinda good.   <br />4. Thank You - 6/10 I don't really like it, but nevertheless, the lyrics are good. <br />5. Me Against The World - 7/10 Good music, bad lyrics.   <br />6. Crazy - 3/10 This song shouldn't been in this album.  <br />7. Jump - 8/10 I don't really understand it but the music is good.   <br />8. Everytime - 7/10 Good.   <br />9. Promise - 8/10 Nice lyrics again by Simple Plan.  <br />10. One - 8/10 A lot of people I know that knows simple plan like this song.  <br />11. Untitled - 9/10 At frst, I didn't really like it, but now I love it because of sweet music and great lyrics. <br /> <br />Overall, this album was a great success, and you would satisfied by the CD.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie, and one of the best war movies ever filmed.  To the poor uneducated lad that rated it a \\"1 star\\" and said that doing laundry would be better than watching this incredile movie....I have plenty of laundry you can do here at my house.  Obviously you have no idea what constitutes a great movie or were posting trying to draw attention to yourself.  Whatever the reason in your case, if you can't post an honest, responsible review then don't post at all.  Believe me, if you are remotedly interested in the Battle In The Atlantic, or a WWII (World War II (2) for our unfortunate, uneducated lad, buff then I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  You won't be dissapointed.
B000002UJQ|1.0|i guess this album is good, or OK (no pun intended)...but you people have to get lives (see Nick's review). why do you care who likes the album?? if YOU like it, and YOU are passionate about it, that's all that matters. some people sound as if they will jump off a building if this album doesn't \\"get back up to a 5 star rating\\"  why do you care if someone likes britney spears?? not saying that i do...but if i did, who cares? music is about personal taste. that's what makes music so amazing. there is such a wide array of sounds out now. the more bands/sounds/genres, the merrier, in my eyes. get over yourselves. wanna be spin writers. you need to get lives. ps..how many reviews do you have??? yeah, do you have anything better to do????
B00006IUL7|5.0|\\"Love is like oxygen. Love lifts you up where you belong. All you need is love.\\" If at any moment in your life, you've been blessed to experience such a rare and precious love, you will be enamored with Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />At the turn of the century, the elite in-crowd gathers to socialize with the creatures of the seedy underworld and the Bohemian lifestyle at the legendary Parisian hot spot, the Moulin Rouge. Satine (Nicole Kidman) is known as the \\"Sparkling Diamond\\" for her dazzling beauty and immense talent as a courtesan. When Christian (Ewan McGregor), a young and talented writer, falls in love with her, she realizes he will be bad for business. A deal is made between the Moulin Rouge's owner, Harold Sidler (Jim Broadbent) and the Duke (Richard Roxburgh), to transform the club into a theater and put on a show, Spectacular Spectacular. In order to close the deal, Christian comes up with a bizarre story off the top of his head and the ensemble cast follows along with it. As the final piece, Satine must exclusively belong to the Duke, a slimy character with evil intentions.<br /><br />While Sidler agrees, it is already too late as Satine has fallen in love with Christian. They are careful to hide their torrid love affair, but it becomes evident to everyone except the Duke who's as sharp as a sack of wet mice. Lushly directed by Baz Luhrmann, this post-modern twist on the musical uses extreme photography techniques, vibrant colors and costumes, and visionary dream sequences to tell the story through song. Academy awards were presented to Catherine Martin for both Costume Design and Art Direction.<br /><br />The magic of falling in love is captured so perfectly in the setting and musical numbers that you are swept away with the overwhelming desire to go fall in love. Kidman and McGregor pour themselves into these musical numbers and sing with the emotions of a thousand magical dreams. It almost feels like you are in a fairy tale. Original songs, \\"I'll fly away\\" and \\"Come what may,\\" easily rival any memorable show tunes, but what really sells them are the voices of Kidman and especially McGregor. As Christian, McGregor gives all an artist possibly could to portray the young writer who is captivated by the gorgeous Satine. You truly believe and feel every emotion he experiences on screen just by looking in his eyes. It feels like you are looking into his soul.<br /><br />Kidman is marvelous as the famed courtesan who is dying, but doesn't know it.

B000268QB2|5.0|I bought this cd as a birthday gift for a friend, based on the great reviews and having heard \\"somewhere only we know\\" a while back. She played it immediately and a few songs into the cd, guests started inquiring about the cd. It was so good, that I bought a copy of Hopes & Fears for myself, the next day. The lead singer's voice is a gorgeous instrument that marries well with the music. The sound is melodic, and even downtempo-ish/loungey on some of the later tracks (track 10). If you're open to Coldplay, then you'll enjoy Keane. As another reviewer said: it's worth every penny...and more in my opinion.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I haven't noticed any more; but the one flaw in this movie is: nobody would except eating anything prepared by a man or woman if she/he extracted her/him eye.He/She certainly would kill the extractor. Would a master do that?
B00062ZE3U|3.0|Maybe it's because I am so attatched to Enter that I was disappointed with this album. Within Temptation still have their trademark Celtic sound but this CD is metal no longer, it's just Goth-pop-rock. It seems that WT have purposefully made their music more accessible, with a \\"pop\\" edge to it just to sell more albums. This is sad because bands should just make music how they want it without the thought of making money. In an ideal world, the money an artist gets form selling an album should be a bonus. But of course it's never going to be like that. <br /> <br />Although the music sounds a little too commercial, it is still amazing music. Within Temptation are hugely talented musicians. The songs are very atmospheric and stick in your head long after the CD has finished playing. Some Celtic instruments have been used on this album (which was something Mother Earth lacked - all the sound effects on that album were done by keyboard) and are used especially effectively at the beginning of \\"Jillian\\". <br /> <br />Sharon den Adel's vocals are disappointing. She is capable of singing at a very high pitch without sounding squeaky. However, her voice has been toned down on the Silent Force and in parts she sounds like Britney Spears! (especially in Stand My Ground). That really baffled me. Another disappointing thing are the guitars. Where are they? Within Temptation have two guitarists but all i can hear is a strange droning sound in the background. Within Tempation now sound like a Celtic version fo Evanescence. <br /> <br />The best song on this album is Jillian (I'd Give My Heart) because of its incredibly catchy chorus. The last track, Somwhere is sad and beautiful and is one of my favorite WT songs. <br /> <br />If you are new to Within Temptation, you could get this album first because it is the most acessable. But I would recommend starting with Mother Earth. Also try Enter and The Dance (they have growling!). If you are a fan of WT's older music then preapare yourself for disappointment if you do get this album. <br /> <br />One question: what exactly is the \\"silent force\\"? I think it's gravity. Teehee. <br />
B000002AV5|5.0|I rolled around on my floor like a Bohemian Sex Godess dancing and being lulled by the voice of this marvel (and often unappreciated beauty) we know as Sade.  I love her.

0140367586|5.0|\\"Pollyanna Grows Up\\" is the sequel to the 1912 classic, Pollyanna and it is surprisingly just as wonderful as the first.  Eleanor H. Porter mantained all the magic of the original novel in this very exciting continuation which takes us far away from our well known town of Beldinsville to the grand City of Boston, where little Miss Pollyanna Whittier arrives to cheer up some new friends. <br /> <br />Fully recovered from her previous automobile accident, Pollyanna returns once again to the city of Boston, in request of her kind nurse, Della Wetherby.  This last has a sister by the name of Ruth Carew, who is miserable and depressed as a consequence of a great loss, a young nephew by the name of Jamie who was taken away by his father, the woman's brother-in-law and who was never seen again.  Della Wetherby's sorrow was just as grand, but her career as a nurse allows her to forget, while Ruth Carew lives alone in her big house in Commonwealth Avenue with nothing else she does or wants to do but to think of the lost Jamie.  However, with her visit, Pollyanna soon changes things around, at first driving Mrs. Carew mad but soon she enters her heart. <br /> <br />Pollyanna finds a lot of new friends in Boston, beginning with the servants in Mrs. Carew's own home, Jerry, a young newspaper selling boy, Jamie, a crippled boy who Pollyanna is sure is the lost \\"Jamie,\\" and Sadie Dean, a homeless working young girl.  In Boston Pollyanna spends most of her time trying to locate Jamie, in desperate hope to please Mrs. Carew, but of this I shall say no more, the surprise twist is for the very reader to discover on his or her own. <br /> <br />The second part of the book may not arrive too welcomed by some readers, like Jimmy 'Bean' Pendenton stated, we readers weren't ready to see little Pollyanna grow up.  However, although Miss Pollyanna Whittier has indeed grown up, she has managed to mantain her usual personality, even if some of her more innocent charm is gone.  Pollyanna indeed needs her gladness and her famouse Glad Game to be able to survive the terrible dark times that have arrived at the Harrington homestead, where she grew up with the strict, but changed Aunt Polly, who has gone almost back to square one. <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you've enjoyed the first part of this story, then you will definitely enjoy the further adventures of the glad girl and all of her old and new friends.  Definitely a great sequel to an unforgettable classic!
B000002BBY|4.0|for a while, i was just a casual rock n roll fan but one day i decided to look up a song by oasis that my guitar teacher had told me about.  i was instantly hooked on the song wonderwall and i had to hear more.  i burrowed cd's and was soon addicted to this band.  i still listen to them very frequently, but often, i turn on the beatles or some other popular band to compare.  i am not going to lie and say oasis doesn't sound like the beatles.  they are similar and did take inspiration from the beatles.  however, that does not change the fact that i love this cd and i think many other people do.  and as far as the gallaghers attitudes are concerned, THEY ARE JERKS.  there is no justifying their plane and concert antics.  that is why you should listen to this cd and not dream about meeting them, because they would probably just give you the finger and walk off.  overall, this is an epic album that i think all open-minded rock n roll fans will enjoy.  even beatles fans, as long as not offended easily by their opinions of the beatles, should enjoy this album.  most people who like rock are either beatles fans or oasis fans.  it is possible to like both with an open mind, and i do like both of them.  i do believe that the beatles came first and always will be the best, but that doesn't mean that you can't add a good cd to your music library
B00003CXA6|5.0|This epic about the Civil War battle at Gettysburg is well acted, well filmed, and pretty acurate. The pivotal battle, and probably, the most important of the entire War. Everyone should know what both the boys in blue and gray went through at Gettysburg. Some may find this film too long, almost four hours, but it could have been longer. I would have liked for the film to show what the citizens of Gettysburg went through during these three days, but other then that, this film is a must see for every American.
0609610570|4.0|Sometimes, all it takes to make something new is to take old ideas and organize them according to a different perspective.   <br /> <br />Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan, two highly respected and experienced business thinkers, took many existing common-sense (not necessarily common practice) ideas and presented them through the \\"new\\" lens of creating a culture of execution (\\"Not simply tactics, but a system of getting things done through questioning, analysis, and follow-through...The way to link the three core processes of any business - the people process, the strategy, and the operating plan - together to get things done on time.\\").  The result was a book with a lot of potential for all organizations and their leaders to improve their individual and collective effectiveness and competitiveness. <br /> <br />This book offered a detailed, holistic approach to what it takes to effectively get things done.  The authors included many great examples (especially the letter to a new leader at the very end of the book), and years of personal observations to reinforce their disciplined execution culture perspective.  Some of the main points repeated throughout the book were the critical role of leadership in fostering honest, accurate, and constructive communications at all levels; a constant emphasis on accountability and follow-through; and how learning how to ask great, probing questions with a purpose can lead to the type of dialogue at any level that will bring reality into focus so effective decisions can be made. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at his/her organization with pride and thought, \\"There is absolutely nothing we cannot do,\\" or with disgust and wondered, \\"Can we ever do anything right?\\"  This book can help you understand the \\"why\\" behind both extremes and possibly give you a new way of looking at and putting to use some well-known, common-sense ideas.     <br />

B00005JKES|5.0|I'm very disappointed that so far, only the first season of the probably best series ever has been released... I suppose that they are not publishing the rest of Twin Peaks as not many \\"first season packages\\" have been sold.

B00029LNHS|5.0|Not that I typically ever agree with most of the Amazon Editors, but in this case Rebecca is VERY mistaken, while Elephunk does pull from a lot of Funk stylings, it does not feel like they were crammed in. <br />It is as Peas as the Peas come, there isn't a single track on the album that doesn't make your head bob, much less get your butt shaking.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|After seeing Christian Bale all buff and beautiful in American Psycho, it comes as quite a shock to see the physical transformation he underwent for The Machinist. No trickery was done with CGI or make-up to convey his gaunt, emaciated appearance. It's a film that beautifully captures that timeless feeling when you can't sleep and yet are exhausted. His character is so desperate to sleep but is haunted by a past trauma that he can never escape no matter how hard he tries.<br /><br />Bale's physical transformation is so astonishing that it's almost distracting. He reportedly lost 63 lbs. for the role and it shows dramatically in his sunken eyes and skin stretched taunt over his rib cage and spine - he is literally skin and bones. It takes the first 30 minutes of the movie to get acclimatized to his presence. Bale does a great job of showing Reznik unraveling and becoming paranoid. All he wants to do is sleep but his mind won't let him. The actor brings his trademark intensity as he plays a man coming apart at the seams.<br /><br />Like Lost Highway, The Machinist features a protagonist who is not to be trusted because he could be imagining everything, creating his own reality featuring a mystery right out of a film noir. Like Lynch's film and Memento, The Machinist is a fascinating whodunit about perception, a cinematic jigsaw puzzle that we must put together along with the protagonist, someone who can't or is unwilling to accept reality and chooses to remember things his own way.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Brad Anderson. He talks at length about the challenges of shooting an independent film in Barcelona, Spain. Anderson comes across as well-spoken and intelligent in this solid commentary.<br /><br />\\"The Machinist: Breaking the Rules\\" is not your typical press kit fluff featurette. Bale saw his weight loss as a victory because he completely resembled his character as written. This is an excellent look at the making of this movie done in the same style and manner of pacing that mirrors the motion picture itself.<br /><br />Also included are eight deleted scenes. While they would have added to the overall atmosphere of the movie, it is pretty obvious why they were cut as they really don't add anything terribly significant to the picture.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.same style and manner of pacing that mirrors the motion picture itself. <br /> <br />Also included are eight deleted scenes.

B00003CXCT|5.0|It appears that a lot of people are a little tick off on how George Lucas has change the original version of \\"Star Wars.\\"  I understand your point of view because I have a similar problem with Ridley Scott DVD version of \\"Blade Runner.\\"  Yet, these two directors have not been doing something that the rest have. <br /> <br />I don't want to get to technique here but for everyone to understand there are two simple facts to know.  The numbers 4x3 and 16x9 are only the size of the rectangular object.  In my following discussion these two sizes only represent a Television Set. <br /> <br />Second, for \\"Star Wars\\" that was film in 2.35:1ratio, to be able to fit your 4x3 TV Screen they had to cut the picture.  Black out mainly the Left and Right portions of the film so it could fit into a 1.33:1ratio that is a 4x3 picture tube. <br /> <br />The DVD suppliers have release \\"Star Wars\\" in both versions.  They could have done this on the same DVD but why do that when you can make more money?  Some of you out there understand the difference between Widescreen and Formatted to Fit Your TV.  You know that none of the original picture that you saw at the theater is missing on the Widescreen version.  This is the 2.35:1ratio version.  While the Formatted version is missing a lot of the original picture but it does fit your 4x3 Television screen. <br /> <br />Let just imagine what it would be like if you compare the 2.35:1 version to the 1.33:1 version and discover that they are identical.  Remember, I am not saying that you will find this with any of the \\"Star Wars\\" films.  They are all truly in 2.35:1ratio.  Yet, what would you think if the 1.33:1 version of \\"Star Wars\\" had two black bars put into it to black out even more of the original picture?  Remember, this is not the case with \\"Star Wars\\" but it is with almost everyone of your 1.85:1ratio movies.  I have found only 6 exceptions but out of the 200 movies that our presented in 1.85, that I own on DVD, is nothing more than thecut version for TV and then they black out even more of the picture.  Check out the DVD version of \\"Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.\\" <br /> <br />For the past 9 years they have been selling DVD's with movies that have even more missing from the original theater release and no one seems to care.  Well, suppose they did this to \\"Star Wars\\"? <br /> <br />Ron Howard's film \\"Cocoon\\" shows you what you have been missing from the original formatted version on VHS.  \\"Cocoon\\" is shown in both formats on the same DVD.  It is the original theater 1.85:1ratio aspect and if you watch a particular scene from both version you will see the major difference.  Yet, \\"The Fugitive\\" has been formatted to fit your 4x3 TV and then they cut more out of this copy by adding black bars so it will have the 1.85:1ratio.  Sure, for the people who own 16x9 TV's this movie fills the whole screen.  Yet, if you were to compare with a 1.33 version you will discover the top and bottom parts of the picture has been removed. <br /> <br />This is a rip off.  False advertising.  Please, take a notice of this.  There are thousands of original 1.85 movies being sold this way.  You are not getting the original theater release version.  Sure, it is still in 1.85:1ratio aspect but they have taken the original 1.85:1 version and cut it to fit your 4x3 TV and then took that copy and added the black bars to make it fit the 16x9 TV.  So, if you can find the 1.33 version of any 1.85 movies on DVD buy it.  This is the only version that is available were the original picture has not been black out twice.
B00004U2G1|2.0|I've been on a binge since getting my SACD player.  I finally chose SACD over DVD-A because of the number of titles and the availability of hybrids.   <br /> <br />I bought 10 titles in my first few weeks.  It was astounding: every time I bought an SACD title and popped it in the player, I was blown away by hearing something amazing.  Gaucho.... The Stranger.... Dark Side Of The Moon.... It was like a drug.  I hadn't spent this much money on music in ages.  I had an unbroken streak of being gobsmacked. <br /> <br />Then I got to this title. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the album is awesome and the music itself is incredible.  But it doesn't sound that different from the re-mastered CD.  Then I saw the words \\"Stereo\\". <br /> <br />Here are three reasons why I believe I'm entirely justified in feeling shafted: <br /> <br />1> My SACD system cost a lot of money.  If I can get a dramatically different experience, then I want one.  That's what I'm paying for. <br /> <br />2> If 2 channels are better then 5.1 for this particular recording, PROVIDE BOTH MIXES!  The technology is right there in the format. <br /> <br />3> I know with every fiber of my being that the record companies will eventually put out a 5.1 mix ANYWAY, meaning I will be expected to buy this album AGAIN. <br /> <br />This whole experience left a very bitter taste in my mouth.  It was like buying one of those super-crappy DVDs that were mastered from NTSC sources: if everything were this quality, there'd be no need for DVD.  Likewise without multi-channel mixes, there is no real need for SACD; hi-def is not enough to make the purchase worth it. <br /> <br />So now I'm on notice: Not all SACDs are 5.1.  Allow me to put record companies on notice: I see no need to buy a stereo SACD.  EVER!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|\\"Octavarium\\" is a bit of an enigma. If this was released in the 70's, the title track would sprawl one side and the band likely would have thrown in \\"The Root of all Evil\\" and \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" on side two. It would have been huge. In the mastery of YES, ELP and older RUSH, Dream Theater have spoiled fans worldwide by overblowing everything in their path. Packing CD's to the hilt and throwing everything they can into their repetoire, they have done the unbelievable- and yet FANS...if you want to call them that- still WHINE for another \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Scenes from a Memory.\\" <br /> Get OVER yourselves! I too started listening with the title track. It was bizarre, but suddenly 24 minutes were gone, and frankly I didn't want it to be OVER! I guess I was trapped in the Octavarium! An ambitious piece of work, in which the band sounds so laid back but completely and masterfully in sync, and Jordan Rudess providing Wakeman/Emerson solos until John's endearing solo at the 20+ minute mark sends the song to the edge. I do believe it is the best mastered track the band has ever done, with a unique cohesion that is awe-inspiring right up to the frantic pace with James wailing is reached. EASILY one of the band's best compositions and I have no doubt it will become a \\"LIVE\\" favorite for years to come. <br /> The rest of the album has 3 tracks, 2 I mentioned previously...that are definitive DT keepers. Add \\"Panic Attack\\" and you have a MONSTER DT album. I wait for Dream Theater much like I did YES in the 70's, but whereas YES disappointed me with it's creative battles and member changes, Dream Theater has stayed on course. Only 2 albums have disappointed me. \\"Falling into Infinity\\" was a shock, I never expected another keyboardist, and the band almost never made another album thanks to the leeches who almost drove Mr. Portnoy over the edge. The recent live set was horrid because James LaBrie was invisibly hidden and compare it to the \\"Images and Words\\" DVD live tour and you will see and hear what I mean.  <br /> \\"Octavarium\\" is a transition for DT. It has been 20 years. Portnoy, Myung and Petrucci have spent more than half of their lives together, and this album speaks of a maturing band, still able to topple the world saturated with garbage like Coldplay and other wannabe Rockers. Frankly, I can't wait to see them this Summer! Go Dream Theater! Rise UP!
B0007SMD3W|3.0|This is an interesting compilation of the original album and a bonus disc featuring thirteen demo's and rare tracks. This might be THE copy to get, unless another version of the album here tops thirteen bonus tracks, but I don't think so. The album is ethereal and charming, or as Peter decribes in the liner notes, 'pleasant'. It's nice to hear the beautiful piano playing of Tony Banks up against some nice strings. Perhaps at the time the band didn't want string arrangements in their music but in retrospect it's nice to hear a Genesis album that actually features string arrangements.     It tells a Biblical kind of story that is the history of mankind, though don't take it on for Spiritual purposes, for it's not an exact account for what is in the bible. My favourite tracks are the less Biblical tracks, like 'Conquerer', which is a comment on corrupt power. The bonus tracks have a more 'relationship failure' thing happening, and be sure to get it for 'One eyed hound', a cool pop-rock song. The original '67 demo's are my faovurite of the demos. Image Blown Out is a fine Beatlesque pop song. Some of the material does sound a bit like 'To our children's children' by the Moody Blues.     But it's a nice experience to hear what is one of the most fondly remembered progressive rock bands finding themselves at such a young age. PS There's a photo of a young Peter Gabriel looking very angry, which was well reflected in the music he made at this time.
B000002UB3|5.0|Wow! 852 reviews and still going strong. That should tell you what kind of album this is. I wont go as far as saying it's the best Beatles album, but I will say it's my personal favorite. Even before the music is put on, the cover itself screams something special. Songwise we get \\"Come Together\\", \\"Something\\", \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", and countless other amazing tracks. However what puts \\"Abbey Road\\" over the top for me, is the way the last half of the album acts as one long winding song. It's just mindblowing, and I always think of how flawless the music is even decades after it's release. What else out there today sounds this good, minus other Beatles albums? I'm not even a Beatlemaniac, but even if \\"Abbey Road\\" was their only album, they would still be legends in my mind.

1563894696|2.0|\\"Batman: The Long Halloween\\" is a fairly contrived story with weak plotlines, characterizations and motivations. The whodunnit aspect is drawn out far beyond the point of reason. The ultimate conclusion is, how shall I put it...idiotic.    The story seems to follow along the trend of past Batman movies...strong on supporting characters and weak...very weak on the leading role of Batman/Bruce Wayne. And when I say, \\"strong\\" on characters, I mean there are a lot of em. A virtual rouges gallery of villians with the intent to confuse and confound the reader as to the identity of the \\"Holiday\\" killer. Believe me...the sheer idiocy of these contrivances abound as we are taken through an endless journey of plot holes akin to a Michael Bay extravaganza.    The story follows Batman as he \\"investigates\\" a series of murders that are committed during various holiday's for over a year. Over a year?!!? Batman, along with the brilliant assistance of Captain James Gordon and DA Harvey Dent are helpless as a serial killer continues his/her rampage unabated. The funny part...Batman doesn't do a whole lot of investigating. For the most part, his main contribution to the story is to look menacing while accomplishing very little. I'm sure we all love to read about our favorite Dark Knight running around Gotham as useless and impotent as befits his moniker...\\"world's greatest detective\\".    To compare Loeb's effort to \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" or to \\"Year One\\" or even to \\"A Killing Joke\\" is like comparing ginger ale to a magnum of Cristal.    Please people. By no means is this a classic. In an age where mediocrity has become the gold standard, the acclaim for \\"The Long Halloween\\" is understandable.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens is a man of his word. Two years after the debut of his '50 States' project in Greetings from Michigan, with a -gasp- unrelated album in between (Seven Swans), Illinois hits the shelves.  Fans of his genre-dabbling folk slash everything style are rejoicing. <br /> <br />As a second installment of a ridiculously ambitious project (50 friggin albums! He'll die first), Illinois is a natural complement to Michigan.  <br /> <br />Sufjan approached Illinois as much with a historian's lens as with his storyteller's voice, covering 200 years of the state's history, notable personas, and quirky achievements spread out over 75 minutes.  <br /> <br />Sufjan has a way of channeling the raw sentiment of his subject matter. As a result, Illinois is very personal. Intimate character sketches like \\"John Wayne Gacy\\" and \\"Casimir Pulaski Day,\\" are both delicate folk tunes that highlight Sufjan's talent as a storyteller. <br /> <br />But Sufjan has many many tricks up his sleeve, and the attention to detail to pull it off. Illinois is a dense, intricate collection of songs that are well conceived and painstakingly arranged. Mr. Stevens shows off his versatility by playing a long list of instruments and dabbling in many styles. It's enough to make an indie-lover cry with joy. <br /> <br />As a whole, Illinois flows like a documentary film score. Each song is another scene, another snapshot of Americana, Illinois-style. The album opens up slowly with a short, soft piano ballad about a UFO sighting that segues into building waves of instruments.  <br /> <br />When the floutists are bellplayers are warmed up in Rogers and Hammerstein fashion, the album picks up where Michigan left off \\"Come on, Feel the Illinoise\\", picks up the place with a skippy 5/4 rhythm. <br /> <br />There are literally too many good songs on this album to spotlight in this short space, but my favorites are:  <br />\\"Jacksonville\\", \\"the Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders\\", \\"Decatur\\", \\"Chicago\\", \\"The Manof Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\\", \\"They are Zombies!!\\" <br /> <br />48 more albums to go. That means of mountains of research for Sufjan, and a whole lifetime of amazing music for the rest of us. <br /> <br />Read more at [...]
B0002WZTOI|1.0|You are not going to find a better story than Top Gun, let's just get that straight right now. A down on his lucky, cocky pilot whose dad crashed into a ship of bananas over thailand gets to go to Mirrormarr to train with the best of the best. Val Kilmer is there! Iceman is a totally mean pilot that doesn't like things that are dangerous, except a good game of beach volleyball. I agree with him as iceman, but Rick Rossovich as slider when you could've had Judd Nelson?  I don't get it. I totally wouldn't have gone with Tom Cruise as Maverick because you knew he was a winner and would go crazy and marry Katie Holmes later in his life. I would've had Ralph Macchio as Maverick straight out of his karate kid role. You never meet his dad in karate kid one, so he could've enlisted in the navy right after the tournament. He would've been picked on by the other guys and told he couldn't be a fighter pilot. The fact he didn't know karate didn't stop him from winning the all valley tournament later that same summer, so why couldn't Myagi teach him to become a top fighter pilot. I would've cast Corey Haim as goose. He's just real likable. The movie was good as it was, my casting would've taken it over the top. The question I've always had is, \\"why did the migs bug out when our guys had fired all of their missiles already?\\". Dumb russians.

B0006OBPTA|5.0|I was finally told last week that you could get all of the karate kid movies in one set packed with special features. When I was told this, I hugged the kid working and tipped him $20 bucks for the information. Needless to say, I bought it and was blown away by the purchase price. These are worth at least $150 to me. Let me try to put into words how incredible it is to have these four movies in one collection. I like to eat fried appetizers. This box set is the equivalent of putting breaded cauliflower, breaded mushrooms, fried cheese sticks and chicken tenders on one platter with all of your favorite sauces. The only way to review this is one by one. I spent the entire holiday weekend watching these films a total of 26 times(I watched 1 and 2 nine times to just eight for part 3. I'll explain part four later). <br /> <br />Part 1- The best of the best of the best. Ralph Macchio was brilliant in the outsiders and someone in hollywood saw that film and went,\\"I've got this teen karate movie script and you need to get me Macchio.\\". Well, they got Macchio and magic was born. I still don't know what angered the Cobra Kai so much about Daniel San, but they just flat didn't like the Jersey kid. I guess I understand a bit because Bon Jovi's attitude kind of rubbed me the wrong way. So he's getting beat up left and right until the Maintenance Man with off the charts karate skills wipes out all of the cobra Kai at once. Anyway, Daniel does chores and in a week or so is a Karate machine himself. He pretty much has to take out the whole Cobra Kai by himself, one at a time, include the black Cobra Kai kid played to perfection by the great Larry B. Scott(Lavar from Revenge of the Nerds). I won't give away the ending but let's just say you won't try that with your girlfriend!! <br /> <br />Part 2- Daniel has the respect of everyone in town, but still no friends so he goes to Japan with Myagi. Guess what, more trouble. Some kid in Japan evidentally doesn't like Daniel San either andwants to kill him. What you, the viewer, will realize in this film is that this is not tournament, this real life. Daniel falls in love with a spicy little asian number and helps save people from hurricanes. It all comes down to a showdown between Daniel and Japan karate kid and I won't give away the ending again, but you'd better finish that laundry!!! <br /> <br />Part 3- Some people really keep a grudge. Evil Sinsay John Creese of the Cobra Kai is still hacked off that the gangly dork with no friends from New Jersey beat the tar out of all of his guys including Larry B. Scott. Even Dutch got his butt handed to him by Daniel San. Creese's plot for revenge involves a mean karate champ(who seriously would kill Daniel san in real life) and a rich guy with nothing to do. I think the toughest part to watch in the whole four part series is when the karate bully and his friends break Daniel's bansai tree. Daniel cries, his chick cries, and yes, I cry. It's tough to make it through. Well if you want to tick off Daniel San, screw with his bansai tree. It's go time!! I won't give away the ending but let's just say this was Ralph Macchio's last karate kid movie!! <br /> <br />Part 4- I don't know why this one was put in the box. The chick that plays the girl that pretends to be a boy is supposedly the Karate kid. I took it back to target and asked why Ralph Macchio is not in the fourth movie. He claimed not to know and made fun of me to a coworker. For whatever reason, Macchio was not in this picture in the box set I bought. Hopefully he's in the one you buy. I didn't watch this one.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I was blown away by the audio and the camera shots on the \\"Live At Wembley\\" DVD set.  Masterfully edited, yet not contrived.  Freddie still at his best, all four band members having a genuinely good time.  A must-have for all Queen fanatics (such as myself).
B0006IIKS0|4.0|all and all it was very interesting.  They took some heat for spending a lot of money, but I thought it was a good watch.
B00000IN5G|5.0|I've never been so keen on death metal until COB made their debut. I liked Something Wild but when I heard Hatebreeder I became a fan immediately. It was far better than their previous with superior songwriting, better production, better performance... better in every aspect. Songs are extremely catchy, well played and constructed. It's like Laiho knew what it took to make me love this album so much. Hatebreeder is one of those albums (Sentenced's Down included) that totally absorbed me into listening it for many months in a row. Every day I had to take the cd for several spins so I would not turn unhappy.    Every song is a killer, but these are my very favourites:  \\"Silent Night, Bodom Night\\" fantastic rhythm guitars and beautiful melodies, haunting chorus and awesome mosh pit session before the solo, quite mellow track.  \\"Hatebreeder\\" heavier and faster, killer chorus and insane solo!  \\"Bed of Razors\\" a bit like \\"Silent Night...\\" with mellow and melodic touch, surprisingly lyrics are love related.  \\"Downfall\\" a lot heavier than all above but very melodic with nice keyboards and crunching riffs, not again to praise Alexi's amazing solo.    After listening to this album you can't deny the talent of Laiho and the band for composing some of the best melo-death metal songs ever with a performance out of this world. I recommend Hatebreeder to get first if haven't heard the band before. It's the tightest package from COB with best songwriting and soloing from Laiho. Buy it now or you're Better off Dead!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many, myself included, the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify, and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible, gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment, not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian, but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to \\"enjoy,\\" but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind.
185984054X|5.0|Christopher Hitchens is the only person of note who actually looked under Mother Teresa's veil of false piety to find a bean-counter of sad souls for the cost of continued human suffering. Hers was a mission interested in converting the weak of body and/or mind, and on many occasion against their will or understanding, at the cost of their lives and proper medical treatment, in order to baptize these unfortunate souls into Catholicism.  When originally published, this book had an attraction for me because there had been reports of some uncharitable actions by the Mother over the number of personal parking spaces she had at her mission. Christopher Hitchens lent credence to that rumor and demonstrated her sham was no petty vanity. He daringly investigated the charade of her missions and saintliness to find an intolerant rigorous parochial who couldn't have cared less about human suffering on earth where there were dying souls at hand for the taking.   His work was so compelling that he was invested by John-Paul II to be the witness against (Devil's Advocate) Mother Teresa in the Vatican when she was advanced for Canonization.
B0002X314C|1.0|This melo-dramatic ghetto epic tale sung with soulfull piano is such a farce!!  The music tries to cameflouge the horrible lyrics!!  ( I'm cheating, your cheating, don't hate me for cheating, I can't blame you for cheating!!)  What is this.  And to prove that all you need is a funcky beat, or in this case smooth piano and grooving melody, the American public will buy anything!  Its a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Posing as neo-soul!!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie reminded me of a 5-star movie, \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\", because of the colorful characters, strange family situation, western location (ND takes place in Idaho) and even goofy name. It didn't have quite the acting caliber (although Jon Gries turns in a great performance as Napoleon's shady Uncle Rico), but a lot of creativity went into this story about those awkward teen years in a typical American High School.<br /><br />The first part of the movie introduces the characters and their ideosyncracies and is a bit slow-moving. I found it to be very funny and careful not to be too over-the-top, e.g., the antagonists (mainly Uncle Rico and the popular gang at school) aren't portrayed as being the personification of evil, just annoying to Napoleon and his friends who are potrayed as average, nerdy high school kids trying to survive. They've all developed worlds of their own in which terms they frequently express their thoughts, e.g., Napoleon talks about needing \\"great skills\\" to get dates with chicks and how his favorite animal is a \\"liger\\" which is one he himself invented.<br /><br />The second part of the movie is the making of the class Presidential candidate, Napoleon's friend Pedro, who is the most unlikely of candidates. Newly-arrived in town, about all Pedro has going for him is that he's the only guy with a mustache in school. He's up against Summer, the most popular girl in school played by Halley Duff, who seems to hold all the cards. While I refuse to give the outcome away, I will remark that Napoleon plays the biggest part in the wacky outcome of the election.<br /><br />I was a little bit confused as to when this was taking place. My wife, who watched it with me and also enjoyed the film, kept pointing out the 1980's styles and music which seemed to make sense, but Kip has a serious online, chat-room relationship with his girlfriend which is definitely post-1995. This doesn't detract from the film much - they played \\"Time After Time\\" at the dance, one of my favorite '80s duets.<br /><br />It's refreshing to see a movie which involves kids without a lot of extreme grossness or with the kids being engaged in any type of vice other than some bullying and insults. There are some extremely funny scenes involving feeding the pet llama, jumping bikes and drawing less than flattering pictures of the girl you want to date. All the characters in the sub-plots enjoy happy endings, including the notorious Uncle Rico - there's no nasty revenge which sets this film apart from a lot of goofy high school flicks.te '80s duets.

B00004TJKI|2.0|Well-acted (but almost THREE hour) drama about a attorney who takes the case of man who has killed his wife's rapist.  Or was she really raped?  Or did the husband really not remember the circumstances surrounding the shooting? Or did it matter? The writing was too much over the top with Jimmy Stewart and George C. Scott trading barbs over what would be allowed in the trial....The part at the end about Mary the hostess was pretty darn unlikely to say the least, so only two stars for the huge insult to viewer's intelligence.
0061015725|1.0|I know people don't like to read bad reviews.  They look at them because they're strongly considering buying the book, so it only makes them disappointed.  With that said, let me say that I have NEVER given a truly bad review to anything I have ever reviewed online.  That streak is over.    I've read several Michael Crichton books.  I loved his earlier works like Sphere, Jurassic Park and Congo.  Andromeda Strain, Timeline and Eaters of the Dead weren't bad either.  This book truly pales in comparison to all of them.  I really, really wanted to like it but the book just wouldn't let me.  Here's an abbreviated version of some of the trouble.    1. The author spends far, far too much time delving into the science of these nano-bots, which left me very bored.  I bought it on CD and listened to it in the car, and even though I was driving through barren desert in Arizona, I still had a hard time focusing.    2. The characters' actions are fantastically frustrating.  For one thing, the main character is completely unable to \\"put two and two together.\\"  What the reader figures out immediately, he can't realize until the very end of the book.  Then, when the action scenes actually begin, the main characters seem to have the IQ of mustard.  Repeatedly, they ignore warnings and go charging headlong into situations that are obvious disasters-waiting-to-happen. (with predictable results)  At one point I turned to my girlfriend and said \\"Is it possible to hate every character?\\"    3. The author inserts the f-word into this book every chance he gets.  It was laughably gratuitous.    4. This is definitely the worst (and saddest) part.  While I've always been fairly riveted by Crichton's style, his story-telling ability seems to have temporarily abandoned him.  I couldn't believe how hackneyed and lame some of the dialogue was.  I am not a \\"dialogue stickler\\" so to speak, but I couldn't ignore this stuff.  It included lines like...    \\"I thought my plan had a 1 in 100 chance.  Maybe 1 in 1000.  But I had a chance.\\"    \\"Feel like a sh** shower?\\"    It all just left me mad that I wasted several hours of my life.  If you're a Michael Crichton fan....you may not be after you're done.  It's that bad.
B00003CX9E|1.0|This movie doesn't deserve any praises. Honestly, the people who saw this movie should sue AFI for the hype they made. Citizen Kane was ultimate garbage in terms of entertainment. You will find that it hard to stay awake.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Not much more to say that hasn't already been said by the other reviews. All I have to say is they finally got it right! No stupid-corny-cheesy Val kilmer, Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, robin, batgirl, or Mr. Freeze in this one ladies and gentlemen. This is the real deal right here! Finally, a serious batman movie, and it actually stayed close to the story of the original comic book series. Excellent job by Christian Bale. My only VERY minor complaints about the movie was it was a tad bit slow in the beginning, and I was really hoping for more of a fight out of the \\"scarecrow\\" villain at the end of the movie. still a 5 star movie.
B0009MAP90|5.0|It's easy to critize the first effort by an artist, especially after the fact, once we have all seen the tremendous heights that his career has soared to and the lows that inevitably follow. But this album is remarkable, not just because of what came after. I dare anyone to listen to &quot;In My Time Of Dyin'&quot; or &quot;House Of The Rising Sun&quot; and tell me otherwise. It took a while for this album to grow on me, though after my very first listen I couldn't help but play &quot;In My Time Of Dying&quot;' over and over, even humming the lyrics at work. &quot;Talkin' New York&quot;, &quot;Pretty Peggy-O&quot;, &quot;Song to Woody&quot; and a few others could have fit perfectly on any of the three albums that followed this one. We also get a lot more of a yodeling sound in &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Freight Train Blues.&quot; I rated this album five stars because I love it and everything else by Bob, but I wouldn't choose this to start your collection. Having said that my first cd was the live bootleg 1966, so maybe it doesn't really matter where you begin. One last thing is about the quality. I own the old cd version and have just purchased the remastered version. WHATEVER YOU DO, SPEND THE COUPLE EXTRA BUCKS AND GET THE REMASTERED VERSION. There's nothing explicitely wrong with the old one, but the too aren't in the same league sonicly.
0670033375|5.0|R. Whitten, on June 30th,  recommended  Victor Davis Hanson's review of Collapse.  Hanson's review  appeared in National Review magazine and National Review Online.  Whitten includes a link to the National Review Online review.  <br /> <br />Hanson believes that the world's environmental problems are best solved by modern technology, free markets and the rule of law.  He gives the impression that the adoption of these methods are the best way to solve the problems of finite resources.  He is, to some extent, correct.  However, modern technology and political structures are not  universal panaceas.  In fact, they can aggravate resource problems.  Modern societies' success is partially based on exploitation of non-renewable energy supplies. Many geologists are predicting the future scarcity of  these resources.  Two of immediate concern are oil and natural gas.  <br /> <br />Diamond gives examples of societies that have solved environmental problems.  Unfortunately, the current United States government is not addressing many problems.  It,instead, has an almost religious faith in \\"free trade, open markets and foreign investments\\", positions that Hanson espouses.  Unfortunately, the \\"invisible hand of the market\\" may not solve the problems of global warming and oil depleteion.  That is because these problems require long term planning by our nation's leaders.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Pat Metheny is a national treasure. It's funny how when someone starts young and acheives artistic success early, we always think of him as a wunderkind (Todd Rundgren suffered from the same typecasting). Metheny's career is at least 30 years old now, and he's compiled a huge, amazingly consistent and varied catalog in that time. One of the things I love about him is his Herbie Hancockish ability to take on vastly different kinds of project, and infuse all of them with an invigorating combination of enthusiasm and professionalism. <br /> <br />I wasn't planning on revewing this album, since I couldn't imagine it's getting anything other than raves, but I felt compelled after reading the review a couple down from mine, the one which criticizes the album's \\"many pointless changes of key, pace and tone.\\" That reviewer bemoans the fact that this album is Metheny's \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" rather than his \\"Kind of Blue.\\" <br /> <br />I'd respond by asking what in the world is wrong with that? Why should we expect Pat Metheny to release a \\"Kind of Blue?\\" (by the way, if you want to hear his \\"Kind of Blue,\\" go pick up \\"Question and Answer.\\") If that guy really did follow Metheny's career as he claims, he'd know that the PMG has always had more of a slight prog-rock edge than Metheny goes for in his solo work. That's what the band is for. Except for the \\"Quartet\\" album, PMG projects have always aimed more for the lush than the intimate, more for the orchestral than the ensemblish. Go look at the back cover of American Garage. PMG is the Methey/Mays take on fusion, and even though it's rarely aggressive, the ethos is as much rock as anything. <br /> <br />It's not that I don't see where that guy was coming from. The album does resemble mid-70's prog, if not stylistically (and it doesn't), at least in its tendency to shift gears frequently. But I don't see any of the shifting as pointless. I see it as an amazing, continually-altering journey. It doesn't bother me thatthe songs jump back and forth between lush, odd-time grooves, odd machine-assisted sound effects and straight ahead, Byrdland-approved blowing. Isn't freedom what jazz is all about? <br /> <br />In fact, this album typifies what I think music ought to be--a unified multiverse of sounds and grooves, flowing like a river of inspiration. That's a cheesy description, but it's apt. In the 21st Century, why should an artist feel compelled to play a head, solo over the head's chord progession, return to the head, and end the song? This is the postmodern era, the time when Eliot's poetry about fragments has finally come true. Everything in life is chopped up!  <br /> <br />Besides, I had a friend from India who had a similar reaction the first time he heard western music. He was used to the static ragas of Indian music, and was disturbed by the restless shifting and constant modulation. What was he listening too? Beethoven. <br /> <br />For Metheny fans thinking about buying this CD, I can't endorse it heartily enough. It doesn't contain a standout, drop-dead gorgeous song like \\"Airstream\\" or \\"Something to Remind You\\" (from the shamefully-neglected \\"We Live Here\\"), but it also doesn't contain some of the low points that plague otherwise great releases like \\"Letter From Home\\" and \\"Still Life (Talking).\\" Don't get me wrong; those are great albums, but I find myself hitting the \\"next\\" button when they get too saccharine. <br /> <br />Overall, I think Metheny will have a hard time topping this incredible ablum. In that sense, at least, \\"The Way Up\\" is, in fact, Metheny's \\"Kind of Blue.\\"
B000002H33|5.0|Okay...call it a mid-age crisis, if you will. Whatever. I wear a suit now, am married, have a kid....but used to rock out to Master, Ride the Lightning, Kill Em All and Justice back when I was in high school in the 80's. I thought I \\"Out-grew\\" Metallica...I realized you don't outgrow good music. I recently bought Some Kind of Monster DVD and it re-kindled a serious love for hard-rock music and the band that I realized you never really \\"out-grow\\", especially when it comes to an album like Master and a band like Metallica. It is truly a classic Metal masterpiece, and Metallica are truly musicians. Even if you are not a true Metal fan (like my wife) you have to appreciate the musical talents of the band (which she now does). The Black album is... the Black Album. 'Nuff said. Take a step back 5 years from the Black Album, open your mind, listen to Master and see that it is even a better???? album than the Black Album. I dare you to find any modern hard rock bands that aren't influenced by Metallica and Master of Puppets (My favorite Met album, although I like all of them) and now my \\"I only like \\"Enter Sandman\\" wife\\" is a Met fan....
B000089CKH|5.0|This album is the example of why \\"independent\\" rock is so much better than mainstream. Offer a band a huge record contract, and then force them to write at least one hit, you'll get an album like high/low. <br />Give the same band full artistic freedom as with an independent label contract, you'll get a beautiful album like this one. <br /> <br />Nada surf should never sign with a major again. <br />This album is nothing less than a masterpiece. Starting off with the beautiful \\"Blizzard of 77\\", it gets clear that Nada Surf can actually write songs when given total artistic freedom. Then you get beautiful tracks like \\"Fruit Fly\\" and \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" Its even gets more obvious that this isnt just a one day fly. <br /> <br />Im already looking forward to their next album.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I got this album over a year ago and I still listen to it at least once or twice a week, its so sick. The only songs I'm not completely in love with are Breathe In Breathe Out, The Workout Plan, and School Spirit. The skits are obnoxious at times, but there not that long, and can be funny every once in a while. My top 5 tracks are: <br />5)Get Em High <br />4)Last Call <br />3)Never Let Me Down <br />2)Family Business <br />1)Through the Wire
B00027JZ3E|5.0|I love this movie. It ranks in my top ten, definately. The plot line is very good, although it climaxes a little too early and feels like a let down. By this I simply mean that the story is more invigorating when michael actually is a vampire, and it seems that he too easily chooses what side he is on. Perhaps it would have been better if he hadn't immediately sought the help of his brother. The dialouge is great, and jam packed with lines you'll remember forever. The story seems so believable, and even appealing in a dangerous way. Everyone knows what it's like to be the new kid, and most of us have experienced situations where the \\"cool\\" and \\"fun\\" groups are the ones that get into the most trouble. We all know what it's like to get sucked in. This movie takes that situation to a whole new level, making it easy to relate to yet exciting and fanciful. I'd love to see this remade, but then again I doubt it would turn out as good.

So my experience with this particular purchase was not pleasant . My friend took DVD with him and forgot to leave it for me to send it back . And I didn't keep the return address (unfortunately ) . I hope that other people who use this seller are not as dissapointed as I was . Thank you for your concern . Alla .
0786890754|5.0|I loved reading every page of this book. I am very suprised at the author being only 21 when this book was penned. I laughed out loud at some parts and teared up at others. I know the area in which this book was set and am married to a local, so I especially appreciated the banter among the the characters.  <br />Even though the story was set around a devastating death, I feel that this book is still a feel - good book. The warmth and love among Holly and her family and friends was definitely heart warming.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Alright i realize the guy does not scream anymore but give him a break, if u really love this band u know he had throat surgery and is no longer able to, but given the fact that he cant this cd is so awesome, i am glad they decided to do a traditional metal album because it gave the guitarists a chance to shine, screw all of u that say they sold out, u need to go listen to slipknot if u want the same thing over and over again!!!
0553582461|4.0|It's difficult for me to perceive of these series as two separate ones - I read the whole six volumes (the Farseer trilogy 1, 2 and 3 and the Fool's series 1, 2 and 3) one after the other, and the story is one continuous one for me.     What pulled me into these wonderful books were the very three-dimensional characters and their development.    The characters became so life-like for me that, even though some parts of Fitz' road  got a bit hard to walk, because of the endless ways in which he managed to make a mess of things, the endless secrets, following misunderstandings, his self-imposed isolation and so on, I read on late into the night because I needed to know how he and the other people who soon got dear to me would progress through the story.   The problems Fitz, the protagonist faces are very human and recognizable and sometimes cut to the heart (sometimes I wanted to kick him too, hard, but if a writer makes you feel so strongly about a character, she does a really great job!). The same goes for the Fool, a wonderfully mysterious, and very moving character with many sides to his personality who, contrary to his name, is by far the most psychologically mature of them all. Shrewd, Verity, Chade, Kettricken, Thick and some others make very believable and human characters, and you grow to like them (and sometimes also loathe them) and know them and care about them.   The writer had made me care so much for so long, that the ending of the story left me feeling let down somehow. At the very end, it seems to suddenly come to a halt and fail to live up to the expectations I had build up as the story progressed all along. This happens in the 37th chapter, with only two more chapters to go, but  for me, as the story moves on, things aren't set right again. For instance, I didn't expect a `happy ending' for Fitz and the Fool, but to leave the relationship between the protagonist and an important main character like that, was quite unsatisfactory for me. After everything you go through as a reader, suffering with the characters, loving with them, hoping for them...for six volumes in total (if you read the whole series, which I would recommend highly) and then finally the main characters miss out on having a good parting in the end (bitter sweet it would be, but surely it deserves some pages or even a chapter dedicated to it!) because of an unfortunate accident that seems to stop the story in its tracks and leaves the Fool thinking Fitz is dead. It didn't feel like a fair conclusion to a very long, very delicate and moving relationship. It deserved more, in my opinion. I also felt the ending as a whole, for all the characters and issues raised, deserved more.  And the courtship of  Molly, his childhood love, though very well written, fails to really move me because she's been out of the story, and his life, too long - as a reader, I `d stopped emotionally investing in her, partly since their parting and even more so since Kettle pointed out the nature of their young, very adolescent love relationship. I had grown to care so much more for Fitz's relationships with the Fool, Nettle, Thick and Dutiful, and others.   And then the rest of the story is folded up and finished, without much further ado, and that's that. For me, it was an anti-climax, I discovered I'd really expected more.   All in all, though wonderfully written, exciting, and painfully moving for the most part, in the end this last volume left me feeling a little disappointed.
B0000024JN|5.0|Debut (official) album, 1986    Before the Beastie Boys released Licensed to Ill, they were a punk band that made extremely short songs on an album that wasn't picked up by a major record label. However, once a few old members left and new ones entered, the Beastie Boys started focusing more on rap and were signed by Def Jam records and released Licensed to Ill, which became the top-selling hip hop album of the 1980's, especially because of \\"Fight For Your Right\\".  Now, nearly twenty years later, you can still rediscover the classic that changed hip hop forever.    Licensed to Ill isn't for everyone but it's a great treat for the people it is for.  The lyrics have mischievious comments about life in high school and doing lots of drugs, but with their energetic attitude, the Beastie Boys deliver it in a rather funny way.  Other topics include going crazy for girls (\\"She's Crafty\\", \\"Girls\\"), doing anything just to avoid school (\\"Fight For Your Right\\"), and even an interesting story (\\"Paul Revere\\").  The only song that isn't silly is \\"Slow and Low\\", which was originally done by Run DMC.  Profanity isn't really a big concern for kids listening to this, but the content is definitely explicit enough that Licensed to Ill would've deserved Parental Advisory if that existed back then, but hey, without the explicitness, this would have never been the classic it is today.    Production can get pretty darn experimental on here.  The Beastie Boys are fond of taking a few songs and sampling their elements together to build some of the craziest beats you'll ever hear.  Even though the sound isn't really original, it's still an innovative tactic and fits the hilarious lyrics well.  The Beastie Boys also include a lot of punk influence in some of the stuff on here, especially in \\"Fight For Your Right\\" and \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\", which I didn't care for at first but soon found to be a really cool song.    With all things said, Licensed to Ill is perhaps the Beastie Boys' greatest attempt at music, and will likely remain their best album forever.  It's true that this was the era when they were the most creative, and that explains why it was a classic.  Overall, a great buy if you want to have fun with music.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta officially come full circle with this release. From beginning to end, the soundtrack of this heroine addict's dreams will keep you captivated and enthralled. Paticularly, L'Via L'viaquez is a song that could easily mix into the favorites list of any rabid music junkie. Don't pass this album up, its one of the only recent releases to actually meet your expectations, and then exceed them.
0062502182|4.0|After a long time I read a book,which,after having begun reading it,I didn't feel like putting it down, until I had reached the last page... <br /> <br />The scheme/plot of the story is so seamlessly inter-linked, you don't have to tax your mind in remembering the details and you seem to glide so effortlessly with the story. <br /> <br />But the most valuable feature of the book, in my opinion, is what reading it, DOES to you. Suddenly you can relate to so many incidents of your lived life and you are, sort of,more at peace with yourself...as you understand the WHY & WHEREFORE of the events that happen in our lives.The feeling is like getting to see the complete design at once, which you couldn't see earlier... <br /> <br />There is enough FOOD for THOUGHT in the book,actually, but for the Discerning Mind. <br />If you are willing to Pause,and REFLECT, and see through the outer crust of the words for the UNDERLYING thought/ meaning...you may find a lot many images..! <br /> <br />Yes,I would recommend it to my son / daughter anyday !!
B0009IW88A|1.0|Well once again the powers that control batman indulged artistry over making movie music that is at all notable. Haunting and mystical though it might be for a music critic, as a theme music for an established hero who already has some music themes to work off of, this soundtrack sucked. Spare us the artists who don't get that the lack of some recognizable theme for a superhero ruins a key part of the movie (and hence the soundtrack album). James Bond w/o the JB theme; Superman without his theme; Spiderman similarly - the Green Hornet, the Flash and the Man from Uncle even, all have themes that tell you when the hero is back; that he is the hero; etc. etc. I really despise them for making such a fine movie and then not be willing to hire Elfman or else to at least pay some homage to him and/or the scores to the non-Elfman Batman movies such as Batman Forever or Batman and Robin so that the fans get music that can be added on to existing music for the hero. Star Wars has consistently hired John Williams to do exactly that; Bond had John Barry and more recently, David Arnold. Obviously Batman is not with it and the Warner Bros franchise is to blame. I bet dollars to donuts the reason was financial; to hire Elfman was more money than giving newcomers a shot at glory. Worst soundtrack of this sort since maybe Goldeneye for Bond or the music for the Hulk (another notable study in mediocre music). Too bad for the fans.....
0786856297|5.0|At first, The Lightning Thief reminded me of Harry Potter: weird, unexplained things happen to Percy. He goes to a summer camp for kids with ... unconventional backgrounds. He never knew his dad, and his mom disappeared on the way to camp, but Percy sees images of her now and then. He ends up with two sidekicks, a boy and a girl, and they fight evil forces in their search to correct a wrong. Gods and goddesses are everywhere, but mere mortals can't see them.<br /><br />But while there are similarities, the plot, characters, and descriptions stand on their own. The Greek mythology backstory is fascinating, and Percy tells his own story (in first person) in an engaging way. He's funny, resourceful, brave, and real, someone the reader gets to know and care about. He even finds out why he's dyslexic and has ADHD--sort of a Greek myth in itself.<br /><br />I think my middle school students would really enjoy this book, and I will definitely recommend it to them. I look forward to the next in the series!
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|I have listened to it many times Its very tough to turn this album off in the middle.  Nice storyline great emotions set up by the music.  Arriving Somewhere But Not Here is a great progressive song as the instrumental portion of the song really gives you the feeling that the main character is going faster and faster back into time were fate went astray on him. Shallow is the song that gets the airplay but Halo is really the track that blows me away and is alone worth the price of admission as the production values of that song live are great.
B00005JNJT|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie with intense anticipation. I have seen every single Batman movie, and I'm a huge fan of comic-book movies in general, with the Spiderman movies my all-time favorites. I also respect the abilities of Welsh actor, Christian Bale, and everything I'd heard about this movie caused me to assume I'd love it. Unfortunately, I am more sorry than I can say that I have seldom had a more painful movie experience than enduring this film. Here are some of the main reasons why:<br /><br />In Tim Burton's Batman, not only did Michael Keaton do a very good job of making Batman fascinatingly mysterious, the Bat Cave and Wayne Mansion, as his two personal spaces, both reflected his personality and added to his mysterious allure. In this new Batman, Director Nolan never shows Bruce Wayne in his own personal space at all the first half of the movie. Instead, he is either in a Far Eastern prison or trekking through vast landscapes in uncharted mountain terrain, all of this peppered with flashbacks of him as a child either in a hole in the ground with terrifying bats or at the scene of the murder of his parents. In the second half of the movie, Wayne Mansion is presented as utterly alien to Bruce Wayne, so it can in no way reflect him and thereby enhance his characterization. And the Bat Cave, as presented in this movie, is simply a raw cave with bats, meaning that it, too, has no ability to reveal either Bruce Wayne or Batman as a character.<br /><br />The villain is also a real disappointment. I respect, too, the abilities of Irish actor, Liam Neeson, but he does a far better job playing tortured heroes than villains. He sports a perpetual non-expression as the Bad Guy of this movie, a man with a very mundane name of Ducard, and a persona that is supposed to be exotic, but comes off as ordinary and unengaging. Where a colorful, frightening villain is important in a regular action-adventure story, it is supremely vital in comic-book action-adventure stories. Thus, a Batman story just doesn't look or feel like a Batman story without a Joker, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, or a Penguin.<br /><br />Another issue, as well, that undermines the potency of Neeson's villain: Because of the way the story is plotted, he is not on stage throughout the movie to taunt Batman with threats of destroying innocent, helpless people, thereby giving Batman frequent opportunities to perform daring, hairsbreadth rescues. Instead, Batman fights tepid battles against a middle-management villain, Dr. Jonathan Crane, played by another Irish actor, Cillian Murphy, who looks, and acts, like an Eric Roberts clone. On the one hand, it is something of a relief that Crane/Murphy sneers a lot better than no-expression Ducard/Neeson, but the downside is that his sneering serves to make Neeson appear, in contrast, an even more flat and uninteresting villain than he already does.<br /><br />Another major beef I have is that this movie's claim to fame is that it \\"explains\\" how Batman became Batman, but it does only a partial job of it. Yes, it shows Bruce learning advanced martial arts in the Far East, but by the time he joins the Ninjas who teach him, he is already a superior martial artist, and we never learn how he has gotten that way. In addition, I found the entire Ninja plot to be a boring echo of the Ninja action-film genre which adds nothing useful to the comic-book action-film genre, and makes no contribution at all to the world of Ninja action films. As for how Bruce amasses his Batman equipment, we get only a partial explanation about only a tiny part of the equipment we know from the comics that Batman owns. We also see almost nothing of Bruce learning to \\"fly\\" with fancy climbing and yanking cables, which I'm guessing is because Nolan decided it would be impossible to compete with the fantastic job the first Spiderman does showing how Spiderman learns to soar and fight using his webs.<br /><br />Ultimately, for me, the reason the \\"creation of Batman\\" portion of this film fails is because it is NOT what I, as someone who loves comic-book heroes, most want to see in a Batman movie--the superhero himself, dressed to the teeth in leather, flinging himself off buildings and kicking the crap out of villains. As a result, the \\"beginning\\" part of the movie comes off as merely a prologue, an elaborate flashback frame for the movie's true story.<br /><br />My final complaint is with the use of setting in the film, both the actual sets of the movie and Director Nolan's use of lighting and camera shots. Nolan focuses constant attention in Gotham City and in the Ninja camp on the \\"atmospheric\\" techniques of dark lighting and jerky camera shots that consistently interfere with the audience enjoying the main purpose of an action film--outstandingly choreographed and executed fight scenes. In addition, Nolan's nightmare vision of New York City aka Gotham City, is so bizarre, it becomes an invasive, scene-stealing secondary character, drastically taking the focus off Batman. A number of far-better-done, comic-book movies, from the Superman series in the 70's and early 80's, up through the current Spiderman movies, understand in a way Nolan obviously does not that a normal, recognizable, everyday NYC allows the audience to viscerally connect with both the victims of the villain and Batman as their rescuer. When victims are ordinary people with plenty to lose, such as homes, jobs, and families they care about a lot, they are much more compelling as victims. Instead, in this movie, all but four of the potential victims of the villain(s) look and act like nuclear holocaust survivors crawling around in the rubble with nothing left to live for. Of the four semi-normal characters, Alfred the butler never gets into any trouble; Policeman Gordon never gets into any rescueable trouble; Rachel Dawes gets into highly predictable trouble because she walks around the entire movie exhibiting the self-protective instincts of a sitting duck; and one cute little boy who is a victim of the villain's poison gas is so surreally healthy and well adjusted among the hell-hole denizens of Gotham City, he stands out like a rose on a dung heap--and is about as believable. In short, the Gotham City Director Nolan so artily portrays is so grotesquely degraded, the villain's plot to euthanize the suffering inhabitants and level it to the ground comes to seem, by the movie's end, a reasonable idea.ause it is NOT what I, as someone who loves comic-book heroes, most want to see in a Batman movie--the superhero himself, dressed to the teeth in leather, flinging himself off buildings and kicking the crap out of villains.

B000000WFU|5.0|I'd never heard anything of Adiemus at all until a few weeks ago. And that's weird because I only listen to the classic radio stations. The first time I heard it was on a plane on the way to my first real holiday in 11 years. What an appropriate way to start it  by opening my eyes to something as incredible as this.<br /><br />Adiemus and the Songs of Sanctuary are terrifically energtic and uplifting. The main instrument in the peculiar, stripped down orchestra is the human voice and the incredibly wide range of emotion the mere sound of it can provoke. The lyrics in the Songs of Sanctuary don't mean anything, they are only phonemes, but not in the style of scat-singing, more of a way of delivering a free-roaming range of emotions rather than a specific point. This is helped along by the abundant freedom of movement sequences between keys and unusual time signatures. The Songs of Sanctuary come across as liberated and adventurous and will no doubt inspire you  to just go out and keep going and going until you are far away from where you started. If you even stop at all.<br /><br />Yes, the songs are exciting and will always keep your attention no matter how many times you listen to them. Composer Karl Jenkins calls the Songs of Sanctuary multi-ethnical and he couldn't be more right. They'll take you to anywhere in the world you want to be. And beyond.<br /><br />I urge you to go out and by this CD.
B000002GBD|5.0|There is so much more to Nazareth than most people know. Every true music lover has a copy of their \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD at least.  They have put out more than 20 albums over the years, and largely these are the unheard albums. Thus, unfortunately, many of their gems have been overlooked. No-one (and I mean no-one) can sing a ballad or a rock anthem the way Naz can.  These guys rock hard! I have seen them in concert many times and they have more pzazz than so called rockers half their age.  It's a shame that they are not more recognized for the rock legends they truly are.  Every time I listen to this godly album I wonder why people like Brittany Spears and Justin Timberlake are more famous that these guys.  I guess it just shows what is wrong with music these days.<br /><br />Anyhow, do yourself a favour - pour a strong drink, light a candle and put on some tunes from these masters.  They will remind you why you love Rock n' Roll.<br /><br />Thanks Boys, and Rock on!
B0009HLDFU|4.0|If you have Windows Media Player 9 on your PC, you should have no problems loading the c.d. content onto your computer.  If you don't have it, I recommend downloading it before you even pop the C.D. into your PC.  To our credit, we tried playing the c.d. the legit way through iTunes on our laptop.  After struggling with the download and the licensing stuff, the files we eventually wound up with were completely messed up.  We wound up having to use my roommate's computer to burn a copy of the c.d. using Windows Media Player, and then using the burned c.d. to load the content into iTunes.  That worked fine.
6305428352|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters twice and I'll tell you, I love this movie a lot.  Dreyfuss gives an excellent performance as a struggling composer who puts his career on hold to pursue another.  As a music teacher over a 30 year period.  The story line touched my heart a lot and it will touch yours too.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is the first disc and artist that has ever compelled me to write a review on this site and I have been lurking about searching for great music for well over five years now. <br />   I was first exposed to Sufjan's music about two years ago when the shockingly good Michigan disc was released.  Who else out there was self-mixing and composing banjo, acoustic guitar, Trumpet, xylophone, vibraphone, drums and god knows what other instruments into lush, vibrant tone poems?  <br />   Michigan was a breath of fresh air and unlike anything else I had ever heard.at the time It told a story as big as the Great Lakes but with all the personal detail that tied everything together and drew the listener  into the state and into a state of mind.  <br />   Could anyone possibly listen to Romulus and not empathize with Stevens as a child or feel the intimacy of  \\"For the Widows in Paradise, For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti?\\" These stripped down compositions contrasted fantastically with the orchestral \\"All Good Naysayers, Speak Up! Or Forever Hold Your Peace!\\" and \\"Detroit, Lift Up Your Weary Head! (Rebuild! Restore! Reconsider!)\\" which gave the listener a sense of the mighty industrial power of the great mid-west. <br />   Next came last year's deeply spiritual Seven Swans release. I haven't been to church in at least 10 years (not counting weddings and funerals) but this collection of musings on the Bible (in particular Revelations) led me to contemplate my place in this world and the possiblity of an almighty creator (anyone want to discuss the Big Bang Theory or the theory of Evolution with Sufjan?). Oh yeah, and the music was out of this world as well. See \\"The Transfiguration\\" and \\"Seven Swans\\" for examples of that. <br />   So it was with great expections (No, I haven't been reading Dickens for the past seven months) I awaited the release of Illinois. Would it match the splendor and personal emotion of Michigan? Would it  capture the religious themes of Seven Swans and translate it into palpable everyman's music? <br />   Where to begin?  <br />   I'll begin simply and state that this is hands down the release of the year so far. No it doesn't have the catchiness of Spoon's \\"I Turn My Camera On\\" off the very good \\"Gimme Fiction\\" disc or the splendid imagery of the Decemberists on \\"Picaresque,\\" but is both more intimate and more grand than either of these fine records. <br />   Illinois keeps me rapt throughout its 77-minute-plus running time, each time I pick up some new instrument or sound that only adds to the disc's grandeur.  <br />   You may be a skeptic like I was when I first heard about Steven's plan to do an albumn on all 50 states. How could you possibly capture the essence of a whole state ( and more than 200 years of history) in one release?  <br />   Without question Steven's only skirts the surface of the entirety of the state of Illinois but  through songs such as unweildy titled, \\"\\"The Black Hawk War, or, How to Demolish an Entire Civilization and Still Feel Good About Yourself in the Morning, or, We Apologize for the Inconvenience But You're Going to Have to Leave Now, or, 'I have fought the Big Knives and will continue to fight them until they are off our lands!,'  \\"Jacksonville\\" and \\"John Wayne Gacey\\" he manages to cover quite a bit of ground. <br />   Highlights of the disc include what may prove to be Sufjan's breakout hit on Indie radio, the eminately singable, \\"Chicago,\\" a song that is more about our need to travel to try and escape our problems and lethargy than about the broad shouldered city it is named after. <br />   Don't fret, The City of Chicago more than gets its due in the third track on the disc, \\"Come on, feel the Illinoise, Part II\\"\\" and \\"The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts.\\" two mind-blowing compositions that weave Steven's  hushed vocals with numerous brass instruments, electric and acoustic gutars, strings, percusion instruments and choirs to convey the gravityof the great city. Perhaps it is in the use of these strings and choirs that this release differs the most \\"Michigan\\" and \\"Seven Swans.\\" <br />    Steven's ability to draw us into his personal experiences can be found on this release as well, as the deeply moving \\"Casimir Pulaski Day,\\" \\"Decatur\\" and \\"The Predatory Wasp of The Palisades Is Out To Get Us!\\" draw heavily on his formative years in both imagery and content. <br />   Time to wrap this review up as I've rambled on enough and frankly I'm at work and desparate to get in my car and listen to this for the 30th time in less than a week. <br />   Buy it now!! This man is a musical genius and needs to be heard by those in the know!  <br />   P.S. I strongly encourage everyone to check out Pitchfork Record's glowing review of this masterpiece for further confirmation that this disc is well worth the purchase price and is one of the best of 2005.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this product, but decided to try it any way.  I am very happy with it!  It does just what it says - spins into hard to get to areas, picks up everything, etc.  Even on carpet it works, however you have to go a bit slower.  Perfect for linoleum and tile. The tray does have to be emptied frequently but it is so easy to do.
1400049628|5.0|The deadpan tone with which the author treats such a ridiculous subject brings to mind the \\"Duck and Cover,\\" method of atomic blast avoidance portrayed by educational films of the 50's.<br /><br />The author is a proficient wordsmith possessing an exceptionally dry wit.  The humor is inherent in the nature of the subject, and the 'bite-sized' subjects make this a perfect privy read.<br /><br />If you are a serious zombie film aficianado, the book's departure from 'established' facts concerning zombies might hamper your enjoyment of this book.  For those who take this ridiculous farce seriously, you must seek help now.<br /><br />Had no idea I would enjoy it as much as I did.  Purchased it on a lark, will be purchasing additional copies for family members who likewise appreciate dry humor.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|I like watching a film that I can watch in mixed company without being too embarrased about the content or language.
B0000009SG|5.0|This is an amazing album.  The musicianship is top notch, the lyrics are hysterical, and Frank rocks hard on guitar.  There really isn't much more you can ask for from a rock album.  Every track is memorable, and for introductory purposes this can't be beat.   <br /> <br />Plus it's got one of my favorites, \\"Camarillo Brillo\\", on it.  That one doesn't pop up too much. <br /> <br />Every track is awesome, it's dirty, fun, and rocking.  Highly recommended.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|You will love Kevin Costner's best movie.  He plays Frank, who bodyguards Rachel (played by Whitney Houston), who is threatened by some pyshco.  This movie will lift you in high spirits the sme Whitney Houston's first 4 albums did!  It features her #1 smash, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.  Plus I HAVE NOTHING and others.
B00000257O|5.0|I actually don't have it yet but I get ASAP. But this one was truly the first I got introduced by my man and label-mate Herbie Hancock. Yes this was the final album he ever did w/ the Headhunters before moving on his own to do his own thing. This disc has a chance to feel the difference w/ much sound, more rhythm, much vibe, nice mellow and a great kick to it. He also my favorite artist there Mr. Ray Parker Jr. on guitar doin' backup on tracks like \\"Doin' It\\", \\"Spider\\", \\"People Music\\", \\"Cantaloupe Island\\", among others. Some of the songs impressed me where from tracks 1 thru 5. Very simple. Actually luv how Bennie Maupin (who double on tenor and soprano sax, flute, and especially bass clarinet once done by alto saxophonist and flutist mr. Eric Dolphy, RIP), he sure creates a much unique sound to his playing. And especially Herbie who's doin' fine on the keys. As to the rest of the band are excellent y'know they can play and rock on fire. Surely a must if u're interested in soul-jazz, boogaloo, funk, fusion, hip-hop, classic jazz, R&B, 'specially sum rock.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Rufus has again influenced me and my music immensely with this album. His vocal range is second to none and writing style in a class by itself. I consider Rufus to be the David Lynch of Modern Pop/Rock music........he's truly an unpredictable original. <br /> <br /> <br />Viseth
B000002KHH|5.0|\\"Paranoid\\" is not only Black Sabbath's most popular and breakthrough album, it is also arguably the best heavy metal album of all time. Saying that it's the best metal of all time should be enough to persuade you to buy it, but if you're still not convinced, read the rest of this review. <br />  <br />Black Sabbath debuted in 1970, so they're probably one of the only bands you listen to that you're parents/teachers have heard of, can tolerate, and maybe even grew up listening to. Black Sabbath also saw the beginning of a guy named Ozzy Osbourne. Ozzy would be fired from the band later in the 1970's, but he formed his own band, which was equally as successful. Plus, the work he did with BS earned him the title of \\"heavy metal's godfather.\\" <br />  <br />Black Sabbath are, to me, the epitome of heavy metal, since (probably) at least 90% of modern metal bands were somehow influenced by them. Granted, Led Zeppelin were probably the band to give birth to heavy metal, but Sabbath are just as responsible for most bands (from Pantera to Slipknot to Eyehategod). And \\"Paranoid,\\" an album which featured five very famous songs, was pretty much as heavy as heavy music got in the 1970's, and was also the beginning of a type of metal known as \\"doom metal.\\" Doom metal is slow and melancholy and has dark and sludgy riffs. Bands like My Dying Bride and Crowbar wouldn't exist if it weren't for Ozzy and the gang. Tony isn't as good as Randy Rhodes, the guitarist in Ozzy's solo band, but he still is pretty great. Plus, he is even more of a legend when you consider Randy Rhodes probably wouldn't exist if it weren't for Tony. <br />  <br />\\"Paranoid\\" is plenty old (now), so it's sound quality has definitely taken a dip. Other than that, however, it has aged very well. It is still getting radio play and bands are still being influenced by it. Even if Black Sabbath break up, their legend lives on through other bands. Thus, if I've ever heard an album that has withstood the test of time, this is it.  <br />  <br />\\"War Pigs\\" follows the classic Black Sabbath song structure (soft-loud-soft-loud). It begins with a few guitar riffs and a drum beat, before turning to \\"dun dun\\" riffs, with a high hat crashing in between them. Ozzy then starts to sing about witchcraft and war, Bob does some good hand drum work and Tony plays slowly cascading riffs. A wailing guitar solo is included, and the tempo speeds up, but the song ends soon thereafter.  <br />\\"Paranoid\\" might be the catchiest song the album. It's very fast paced with groovy guitars (which chug in the verses), has good vocal hooks and a short but sweet solo is tossed in at the end. <br />\\"Planet Caravan\\" is very spacey and mellow, due to the almost aquatic guitar chords, dreary vocals, and soft hand percussion (which almost sound like tribal drums). This song is partially famous because Pantera covered it, and even though they did a pretty good job, there's nothing like the original version. <br />\\"Iron Man\\" opens with a few thumping drums, then a world famous and very catchy guitar riff. The first four words are spoken with a robotic voice, and then the music changes to echo the vocals and lyrics. There's some more good, driving drumming here, but I think this guitar solo is the best on the album.  <br />\\"Rat Salad\\" is an instrumental, and Bill's drum work makes it famous. It begins with almost machine gun snare drumming and fast pounding floor toms, and there's a great drum solo around the 1:15 mark. This everything but the kitchen sink solo lasts for about 50 seconds. <br />  <br />\\"Paranoid\\" is nothing short of a classic. It is absolutely essential listening, and a cornerstone of any heavy metal collection. Buy this album or forever be un-metal Plus, since heavy metal is an important part of rock's history, \\"Paranoid\\" is a must own for any complete rock collection.. And even if metal isn't your thing, at least give Ozzy, Tony, Terence, and Bob credit for being the influential godfathers of metal, and for making one of the most important albums of all time.
B00004YC2F|5.0|Volodos is an aspiring star at the piano, and he has showed us his technical and musical abilities several times. This recording of Rach 3 is to be remember as one of the great! I am not saying it is the best, because that for me can change day by day. I have my top 3 and that is enough! <br />The performance is excellent both from pianist, orchestra and sound technicians! The sound is overwhelming on a good surround system! <br />The enterpretation is strong and majestic and has all the elements you demand plus somewhat more. The octaves on the end of the 3. mvmt could have been much faster. We know Arcadi by now, and is there something he has no problems handling it is octaves.  <br />If you like Rach 3, this shoukd be in your shelf!
B00004SVIK|5.0|This live album is incredible. I think it is even better than PULSE. Tracks like \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. II,\\" \\"Empty Spaces,\\" (The original, extended version) and \\"Mother\\" are excellent on this album. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is arguably better than the original studio version, and \\"Run Like Hell\\" really cooks. The audio quality is excellent. It feels like you're right in the middle of the concert. <br /> <br />Also, be sure to buy this edition rather than the cheaper one. It comes with a hardcover book, filled with hundreds of pictures of the live concerts, commentary from the band, and more. It is well worth the extra few bucks. <br /> <br />I hope they will make a DVD of this awesome concert. There should be plenty of footage from when Alan Parker filmed the concerts for The Wall movie.
1573223026|4.0|I can't give anything by Nick Hornby, an enjoyable writer who keeps readers good company, a 5 star. He is just too middle-brow. But, barring that, this was for me, his best book to date. <br /> <br />The characters are clearly delineated, the story moves and is moving. And I look forward to the film.
0553260111|5.0|The Bourne Identity is another Ludlum classic.  If you have ever seen the movie, throw out any thought of it.  The movie doesn't have the same villain and many of the characters are missing.  The plot in the book is much more detailed than that of the movie.  If you've ever read a Ludlum book, I'm quite sure you'll love this one.  If you like well-developed characters, a plot that makes you think, and well-described action scenes you'll like The Bourne Identity.
B000001DZQ|3.0|Roy Buchanan was an exceptionally powerful instrumentalist whose blues-based playing was a nice contrast to his exceptionally untraditional use of a Telecaster. Roy loved to manipulate the volume and tone pots of his Tele to get unearthly volume swells and wah-wah like effects that could make his guitar sound like a violin or a woman screaming. Anyone listening to this collection will notice similarities between Roy's playing and that of Jeff Beck and Dave Gilmour, both of whom were huge fans of Roy's and freely admitted his influence over their styles. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, like many gifted guitar heroes, Roy's studio output was erratic. Most of the first CD, which features Roy's beautiful version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" along with some fine blues covers, is some of the best instrumental music ever recorded. Sadly, Roy also had an absolutely terrible singing voice and either he or his producers insisted on recording vocal tracks. \\"The Messiah Will Come Again\\" works because Roy only delivers a spoken intro, but other songs are seriously marred by his flat, deadpan delivery. The second CD is even worse, this time including an overlong jam around \\"Green Onions\\".  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of Roy's and his best material is some of my favorite music. As an anthology, however, I'd prefer that he were remembered for his very best music and not some of his most uneven. This could have been edited down to a very good single disc. Instead, we're left with a two-disc set that you'll end up skipping through huge sections out of necessity.
B00003CXSP|5.0|If you're expecting another \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", then look elsewhere. This is a \\"sui generis\\" film, unlike its predecessor and the one that came afterwards. Thank God that Jodie Foster turned down the part of Clarice Starling for this film, because it forced the producers to think things over. They re-worked the script and what they came up with is brilliant. The plot has been covered elsewhere, so what I'm going to do is to offer some food for thought. Just notice: <br /> <br />- the contrast between pure Hannibal horror and the exquisite classical beauty of Florence, where a great part of the story unfolds. <br />- the parallels with the Bible and the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Of course, Hannibal (pure evil) reverses the usual standpoint and identifies himself with Good (an angel of darkness presenting himself as an angel of light.) Inspector Pazzi in Florence, who betrays Hannibal for a reward, becomes Judas and finds the same death. <br />- Remember the story when Jesus cast the demons into a herd of swine? Well, that's exactly what the persecutors of Hannibal (Mason Verger in collaboration with Inspector Pazzi) are trying to do. Of course, it doesn't work. Another reversal. <br />- The brilliant and horrific cannibalistic insinuations to Inspector Pazzi's wife from Dante(Could he daily feel a stab of hunger for her and find nourishment in the very sight of her? I think so.) <br />- Of course, the attraction between Hannibal and Clarice. Why? Clarice is the exact opposite of Hannibal. She is shown as pure and good. She makes the world more interesting. When Pazzi is killed, she bursts into tears because she wasn't able to avert it. When Clarice is unfairly defamed and rejected by the FBI, Hannibal says to her :\\"...would they have you back, you think? The FBI? Those people you despise almost as much as they despise you. Would they give you a medal, Clarice, do you think? Would you have it professionally framed and hang it on your wall to look at and remind you of your courage and incorruptibility? All you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror.\\"  <br />- The breathtaking ending: Does evil have any power over love and true goodness? <br />- The soundtrack is fantastic. The climax in the end (Hannibal and Clarice in the kitchen) is complemented perfectly by a Mahlerian-like adagio. This is probably the most beautiful love scene I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />Comparisons are odious, so I won't compare Julianne Moore to Jodie Foster. Moore is brilliant in this film and perfect for the role.  <br /> <br />This film is brilliant in all respects. Ridley Scott has given us another masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"I came halfway around the world to watch you run, Clarice. Let me run, eh?\\" <br /> <br />
B000957O82|5.0|Simpering with delight!  That is exactly how you will be behaving after you have watched this film!  Will Smith`s mellow, optimistic presence makes this movie enjoyable  -  and that`s good news for a couplet in the infatuation phase.  Podgy accountant Kevin James, receives love lessons from a unusually sophisticated Smith who would relish a go-steady relationship with Eva Mendes.  All very fascinating, but the irony of it is that Smith`s love life is similarly made into a muddle. But this makes it all the more amusing that advice is emitted from one whose love-life remains mirred in failure.  While literature-attache` Mendes has Smith in pursuit, James vigorous attempts to impress his dream-woman Hitchens might falter , with a bombardment of macho acts.  Then again, it might not!  But what all this adds up to is merely a stylish date movie, harnessing both the young and old audiences.  Smith and James equally share a love-crazed desire, but the rummaging around for clues and lumbering from here to there makes this film a harmless and fun frolic.  Recommended for all!
B00004CWO8|1.0|Please, save yourself the money and bother.  This is a very misguided production.  I can only blame myself because I didn't read the description carefully.  It appears that Mr(?)Bourne is hoping to normalize some abnormal behavior by blaming it on abnormal behavior, which he must consider normal. Follow that? Is this an autobiographical piece?   If my only gripe were the ridiculous content I would keep quiet, assuming that maybe I'm just a prude.  But fluffy pantaloons on sweaty bare-chested BIRDS!  Oh, please.  And the choreography looked like a lame effort at West Side Story meets Swan Lake.  My adult children and I sat and laughed until we cried--skipping ahead when we were completely disgusted, of course.  Stick to playing gigs at pubs, Mr. Bourne.  I ordered another version.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Bear McCreary took over as the main composer for Battlestar Galactica after Richard Gibbs left to continue working on movie scores. With McCreary writing all of the main music for the first season, I found the music even more rich then that of the miniseries that preceded it. Not only is the soundtrack rich with low-synth percussion action tracks, but it also employs such genres as opera, muzak, and string orchestral to convey the feeling of a scene. The use of drums in this soundtrack trumps their use in the miniseries with even catchier drum rolls. <br /> <br />Most notably, the string orchestral pieces Passacaglia and the Shape of Things to Come are definitely the best pieces on this non-generic soundtrack. Even with an orchestra at his disposal, McCreary did not write any bombastic score and instead wrote beautiful soothing melodies that ironically contrast the scenes in which they are placed, making those sequences all the more memorable and enticing. Battlestar Galactica is successfully breaking free from the shackles of the modern sci-fi genre, and the music which strays so far from the orthodox helps it do so.

0786715103|3.0|A sad book. Sad because of many reasons, but the greatest to me is that a \\"fighting\\" soldier was not picked to command the Rwanda UN effort. This general had never experienced shots fired in anger before and his actions on the first day of fighting when he lost ten peacekeepers were simply not competant. Everything in Rwanda was downhill from there.
0670033375|5.0|I liked Jared Diamond's last book, but this one is even better.  His starting off with an analysis of Montana really brought his points home for me; I have a brother who lives in Montana.  Diamond is basically sending a wake-up call to our society: economic and social collapse due to environmental degradation has happened to other societies in the past, and it could happen here if we don't take steps to prevent it.  The collapse of the Greenland societies is fascinating reading; Diamond is a fine storyteller.  I liked the analysis of Easter Island also.  When I was younger I was fascinated by Easter Island (I read \\"Kon-Tiki\\"), but I wasn't aware of the new research on the reasons for the end of its civilization.  Diamond makes an excellent response to landowners whose constant refrain is \\"don't tell me what I can do with my land.\\"  Diamond points out that many pieces of land have distant managers, and there is no guarantee that problems will be detected before it is too late.  Where a trend is slow and concealed by wide up-and-down fluctuations, \\"creeping normalcy\\" makes this problem worse.<br /><br />I can argue with a few of Diamond's points, but not with his overall conclusion:  for our society to have a long-term future, we must take steps to control the population of our country and the world, and safeguard our planet's environment.  This book is essential reading for all citizens.  For anyone who thinks that a collapse can't happen here in the good old U.S. of A., I offer you a quote from Proverbs 16:18:  \\"Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.\\"
B00083BY4U|4.0|When I went to go see \\"Saw\\" late last night I was thinking \\"saw\\" as the past tense of see and not \\"saw\\" as the noun (\\"a hand or power tool or a machine used to cut hard material and equipped usually with a toothed blade or disk\\") or as the verb (\\"to cut with a saw\\"). What was I thinking? \\"Saw\\" is in the Grand Guignol of \\"Seven\\" and \\"The Bone Cutter,\\" and apparently had to make some last minute cuts to avoid getting saddled with a NC-17 rating. That alone with give you an indication of what first time director James Wan and first time writer Leigh Whannell were going for in \\"Saw,\\" even with only $1.2 million to make the film and 18 days to shoot it.<br /><br />Adam (Leigh Whannell), a young man, wakes up underwater in a dark room with a chain around his ankle. He is not alone, and when the light come on he finds himself is what appears to be a long abandoned public restroom. At the other end is Lawrence (Cary Elwes), who is also chained to a pipe. On the floor in between them, out of their reach, is the corpse of a man who apparently killed himself with a gun. In his hand is a tape recorder. After becoming oriented to his strange surroundings, Adam discovers a plastic bag in his pocket, containing an envelope. Inside is a key and a small cassette tape with the words \\"Play Me.\\" Let the game begin.<br /><br />Beyond that you really do not want to know that much about this before you see it, and given the dreck that passes for horror thrillers in recent years \\"Saw\\" is worth the seeing in the theater. The last time I actually went to see a film in this genre in a theater was probably \\"Hannibal,\\" and I have not had any reason to regret being selective in this regard. However, this is not going to be a date movie, but one for hardcore fans of the genre who prefer their DVD editions to be the director's unrated cut of the film. \\"Saw\\" is a film that works more in the world of horror films than it does in the real world, but that is certainly part for the genre at this point.<br /><br />The entire film does not take place in the abandoned restroom, although that is main arena. Lawrence knows something about the \\"Jigsaw Killer,\\" who has been constructing elaborate dances of death in which his victims have to try and save themselves. Only one victim has survived to date (Shawnee Smith), so it is possible to get out of this alive, just extremely difficult and we are treated to a couple of examples of where it did not go as well. Investigating the case are a couple of detectives, Tapp (Danny Glover) and Sing (Ken Leung), and the chronology of the film gets skewed as the present and the past become confused. The game also involves more than the two men chained to the wall, because Lawrence's wife, Alison (Monica Potter) and daughter, Diana (Makenzie Vega) are part of it as well.<br /><br />During the film's endgame things are moving fast enough that you probably will not be able to figure out how it will all play out even though \\"Saw\\" overplays the obvious red herring card. The film pushes one of my least favorite buttons a couple of time, which is when somebody has a gun on the villain and does not blow them away. If there is one thing we have learned from all of these movies it is that hesitating when you have the bad guy in your sights is never a good thing. I especially go through the roof when a trained law enforcement officer is pointing the gun right at the killer and the killer still gets away (even Clarice Starling is guilty of this sin in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"). So there is some heavy handedness to Whannell's script that hopefully will be replaced by something more elegant when he and Wan make their recently announced \\"Saw 2\\" sequel for 2005.<br /><br />But \\"Saw\\" is not an elegant horror film, although Wan gets points for keeping the most horrific moment of the film off screen (even though the rationale is small budget and not true aesthetic choice, which makes me fearful for what will happen when Wan and Whannell have a muchbigger budget for the sequel). The \\"Jigsaw Killer\\" has a warped interest in having his victims better appreciate their lives, so getting out alive has to do not only with Lawrence and Adam solving the tasks they are given, but also with finding out some important things about each other. The important thing here is that the film's final scene is pretty horrific, even if the film cheats a bit to get to that point, and that even when the screen goes dark and the credits start to roll, Whannell keeps the horror going.ll have a much bigger budget for the sequel).

B00005QDW5|5.0|If youre new to Pink Floyd, then by all means dive into this greatest hits album.  These type of albums try to show a range of work over time.  Since Pink Floyd has been around since the sixties, the range here spans decades of work.  If you like what you hear, and want to begin collecting the records, start with Dark Side of the Moon (1973).  This begins the meat of their best work.  Then get Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979-80). If youre still enjoying the music, and i suspect you will be, there are some fringe records right before and after this work that are excellent.  Meddle (1970-71) and The Final Cut (1982).  Then you'll have the basics.  I cannot stress the importance of one overlooked work from the 1990's, and it is not the Division Bell (1994).  It is Roger Water's Amused To Death (1992).  It is a solo album that wont be found under pink floyd. The album in this reviewer's opinion stands up to any of the floyd's best material.  I know some will disagree, but believe me it's worth a listen.  No review of Floyd can be complete without a mention of Syd Barret's work with the band, which in reality is one album Piper At The Gates of Dawn (1967), a few songs on the second album A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) and some singles.  Syd's music was fantastic and his departure from the band from mental illness was sad.  Beyond Piper and Saucerful, avoid the albums prior to Meddle in the beginning.  This was an experimental phase in which the band was growing.  Return to these later on.  So pick up the greatest hits if youre new to Floyd, but i bet you'll soon be buying Dark Side of the Moon... <br />( and Roger Water's Amused to Death)
0671799320|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn about the history of the oil industry and its effect on World history.  Not only is it informative, but it is also well written and interesting to read.   <br /> <br />Although it is almost 1000 pages long, it kept my interest throughout.  Much of the book is focused on the impact oil, or lack of it, has had on governments and wars.  Although the book discusses many major oil field discoveries with some detail.  I would have preferred the author to go into more detail with regard to the discovery of Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea.  Nonetheless, this is a book that I would strongly recommend to any history fan or anyone interested in oil.

B000094PYM|4.0|In retrospect you can say that Led Zeppelin went out with a whimper.  After less than stellar responses to their album \\"Presence\\" and their live concert film \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" in 1976, as well as the death of Robert Plant's son Karac a year later, Led Zeppelin did not produce its final studio album, \\"In Through the Out Door,\\" until 1979.  But while rehearsing at Jimmy Page's house for an American tour, John Bonham was found dead in his bed after drinking all night.  In December of 1980, Led Zeppelin announced that they would not continue playing with Bonham and officially disbanded.<br /><br />In 1982, Led Zeppelin released \\"Coda,\\" a collection of eight songs that they did not release on their previous albums because, well, they were not good enough.  The tracks that stand out are those dominated by the late John Bonham's frenetic drumming, \\"Poor Tom\\" and \\"Bonzo's Montreaux,\\" which certainly seems fitting. You wonder if Jimmy Page turned up the drum tracks before they released this one since Bonzo's drumming seems much more prominent than usual. The alternative version of \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" is interesting, and hints at what would be available when the group released the live versions they did for the BBC. Most of these tracks, such as \\"Ozone Baby,\\" \\"Darlene\\" and the punk rock \\"Wearing and Tearing,\\" are hard rockers that you would readily identify as being from the period when Led Zep was working on \\"Physical Graffiti.\\" If you are like me, and that is always a remote possibility, you will listen to this one a few times and then go back and listen to Led Zeppelin's \\"real\\" albums.

B000929AJQ|4.0|\\"With Teeth\\" is one of those incredibly difficult albums to review -- Trent Reznor's earlier work has become so legendary that his newer work can't hope to get the same response. Especially if he goes in a totally different direction -- in this case, a less electronic, more organic direction.<br /><br />Sure, it lacks the visceral punch and of albums such as \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" and it doesn't really go anyplace new, musically speaking. But the newest album from Nine Inch Nails has a dark, raw-edged power of its own.<br /><br />Reznor has always depended, in a way, on pop melodies done in an industrial style, and that sound emerges in songs like the raging, explosive \\"You Know What You Are?\\", where he repeatedly shrieks, \\"Don't you f*cking know what you ARE?\\" like a banshee with an identity crisis. I know who I am, but what are you?<br /><br />Dark synth shows up in sputters and thick waves, especially in some of the quieter songs. The closing and opening song are the most prevalent in these, with Reznor singing sadly over nothing but bass and drums, or else over piano and some buzzing synth. But here, the industrial sound seems to have been switched for a more hard-rock vibe -- as Reznor said, it sounds more organic. It sounds almost live. While there is still some thick synth, the sounds that really grab your attention are more hard-rock oriented: Dave Grohl's excellent drumming, and Twiggy's searing basslines.<br /><br />Is it good? Yes. Is it as good as it could have been. Decidedly not. While it's a pleasant listen, Reznor only dips lightly into new musical styles, hinting at bossa nova in the opener. Most of the time, he quickly returns to what he's already doine before. And the loss of much of the thick, muddy electronica leaves \\"With Teeth\\" sounding a bit underdressed.<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"With Teeth\\" retains enough rough, raw energy to be worthy of being called Nine Inch Nails. It can't be denied that the instrumentation is masterful, whether it's the raw basslines, sharp drumming or driving melodies. Grohl deserves special notice for his work here. Reznor sounds like his old tormented self, whether railing about the U.S. government, wistfully murmuring about \\"all the love in the world,\\" or raging that \\"Love is NOT ENOUGH!\\"<br /><br />No, \\"With Teeth\\" is not the best or most innovative thing that Nine Inch Nails has produced.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens has quickly become one of my favorite artists, and his new CD, Illinois (Come On! Feel The Illinoise!), the second chapter in his 50 states project, is another amazing collection of themed songs filled with history, culture, and aspects of Illinois. I've been able to listen to this record for about a month because it was available for purchase on Stevens' record label Asthmatic Kitty ([...]), before it hit the shelves today.    Out of all 22 songs on the CD, about 15 or 16 of them are actually songs, the rest are instrumentals ranging from 1:30 to :06! (One last \\"Whoo-hoo\\" for the Pullman.) The songs titles are also ridiculously long. The title of the second track (an instrumental) is so long, it wont fit on an MP3 info tag.    The format for this CD is the same as Michigan, but there is much more experimentation. You wont find songs like the beautiful \\"Holland\\" or \\"For the fatherless in Ypsilanti\\" on here, but beautiful has a new meaning on \\"Illinois.\\"    (For your sake I'll shorten the titles.) \\"UFO Sighting\\" (the first track) has a simple, yet hypnotizing piano and flute part. \\"Come On! Feel the illinois\\" is not unlike \\"detroit\\" and \\"they also mourn who do not wear black.\\" It has the same upbeat 5/4 tempo. I also learned in this song that Illinois is where Cream of Wheat was invented. Sweet.    \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr.\\" is easily the best song on the record. This is a haunting song obviously about the serial killer, who raped and killed various men. The vocals are incredible and the lyrics are thought-provoking (And in my best behavior / I am really just like him.) \\"Jacksonville\\" is an upbeat song boasting loud trumpets and violins. And don't forget the banjo.    \\"Decatur\\" is a nice song with great vocals and harmony. It's somewhat funny listening to the lyrics as he rhymes emancipator, aviator, and alligator. \\"Chicago\\" is an amazing anthem that has the catchiest chorus on the album (You came to take us / All things go, all things go / To re-create us/ All things grow, all things grow) And of course, there is a minute at the end of the song with vocals symbolizing \\"the windy city.\\"    \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" sounds like \\"Romulus,\\" with great banjo and guitar, but nothing can compare to my second favorite song, \\"The Man of Metropolis steals our hearts.\\" This song definetely reminds me of the \\"sun came\\" days, because the electric guitar takes over this song. The riff is infectious, the vocals in the chorus by the \\"Illinoise makers\\" are breath-taking; When the bass comes in during the intro, you'll be hooked.    This album sounds very little like \\"Michigan\\" so it's impossible to compare the two. I'm looking forward to seeing what he does for other states. I read an interview online saying he's currently working on Oregon, New Jersey, Vermont, and Rhode Island. He said Vermont might be a Christmas album, and a few states will be short EP's. He also said that he'll use different forms of media like tapes, vinyl, or even 8-track. Though I'm excited he'll be doing my state sometime soon (Indiana) im sure it'll be a pretty boring cd! \\"Illinois\\" is an amazing album that i KNOW you'll enjoy whether you're a fan of Michigan, Seven Swans, or even A Sun Came.    Also a note... the cover of the CD was changed due to copyright laws i believe. the original cover (the one i have) has Superman flying down the middle. Cheers!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan Stevens has been a favorite of mine for quite some time now, but after this album, he may perhaps soon be a favorite of many, many others. <br />In his project to write an soundtrack for all fifty states, he has so far created very high expectations for each following album. Michigan was his first. It was, in a manner of speaking, absolutly brilliant and quite honest to the spirit and essence of the great lake state. Naturally, I expect equal listening satisfaction from his newest album \\"Illinois\\". However, I was greatly surprised by the absolute genious of this album. My expectations were surpassed with stunning new music. It, unlike michigan, is a little more upbeat and jazzy as it proceeds with perfect lyrics and a story behind every song. I feel like I'm learning all about the HEART of the state when I listen. Not only does it include upbeat songs such as \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Come on feel the Illinoise!\\" but it includes a bit of history for you to identlify with as well. The song \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, IL\\" is a perfect, beautiful song that poetically discusses the event. Coldplay has nothing on Sufjan's catchy piano bits. He uses it very well to give more classic worth to his music. \\"John Wayne Gacy Jr\\" is a chilling, but gorgeous, track that gives a history as well as a memorable perspective on the well known clown killer, Gacy. He speaks of the victims and their legacies that are better to be remembered than lost without compassion. My personal favorites, as they are extremely catchy and geniously composed are \\"The Predatory Wasp...\\" and \\"Decatur\\". Of coarse I absolutly adore the entire album for its perfection and quality, but these two songs stick out the most. \\"The Predatory Wasp...\\" has a slower beginning with soft vocals and a flute, but then it splits into several harmonies and instruments that compliment eachother most happily...in the end, you'll think you might have been in the happiest place on earth with the happiest people andthe meaning of it all fresh in your head, ready to tap your foot as the rest of you is occupied by its multiple lovely melodies. You'll be mad about him when its through...Sufjan, that is.  <br />In general, the album is a wonderful variety of music genres, styles, and subject. Its a perfect theme for him, really. I do believe that this album is highly professional extremely amazing. I honestly know it would be desired by almost ANYBODY. It is versitile but keeps its unity through the transitions and cool use of Sufjan's instrumental compositions. I played it at work and nearly everyone with interest in music inquired about it or complimented its unique but very, very likeable sound <br />Buy it and I promise you will fall in love. We all need an album like this to keep our heads. An album like this one is something perfect that should be a model for all other artists.  <br />Please buy it. &lt;3 Thanx

B0000CG3K6|5.0|While British rock band Muse are big in the UK, the US is only just starting to get acquainted with these original, entrancing musicians. And their second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" they accomplish the almost impossible -- every song is epic and thrilling.<br /><br />The first two songs open with delicate rippling piano intros that suddenly blossom into rock riffs. Feedback kicks off into sizzling basslines and riffs in \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased,\\" while wind chimes and an acoustic melody are at the heart of \\"Screenager.\\" \\"Hyper Music\\" is the only dud. It's a discordant clatter that becomes a discordant rock song -- nuff zed.<br /><br />But as good as most of the album is, Muse save the best for absolute last. The penultimate song \\"Feeling Good\\" is perhaps the best -- fuzzy chopsticks start the song, followed by a stretch of epic rock and soaring vocals. The finale is no less entrancing, a slowly stately wave of sound that slowly transitions into an equally rich rock song.<br /><br />Americans really got to know Muse through their latest album, \\"Absolution.\\" But it's not the only album they have done, nor is it the best. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" may well take that honor, or at least tie with their debut \\"Showbiz.\\" Relatively few people know about these earlier albums, or about the rich apocalyptic quality of Muse at their best.<br /><br />Muse is definitely a band for Radiohead fans -- it has the same rich spaciness and art-rock quality, but it's more grounded and gritty. The most entrancing instrumentation is done on piano -- it can be delicate, dark, fuzzy, or outright epic. The piano is accompanied by smashing percussion, sinuous riffs and basslines, and sweeps of spellbinding electronics.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy puts his good vocals to use in every song, and he's as versatile as his piano. Much of the time he opts for the smooth, low sound. But he also gets to howl, and occasionally sounds like he's been huffing helium. And the songwriting is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Though it was a financial flop, Muse deftly dodged the ARTISTIC sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten. An outstanding piece of work.ing is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"  <br />  <br />Though it was a financial flop, Muse deftly dodged the ARTISTIC sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|I have most of these songs and will own the rest one day on all their albums. Yes, there are some great songs on here, but not any of my very favorites that are found mostly on Beatles WHITE ALBUM!, and of course the 2nd half of Abbey Road! I know some people that only own this album and it bothers me, because they are missing out on better Beatles songs...<br /><br />...just because they were number one hits doesn't make them the only good hits worth getting. In the end it's just another reason to make more money by releasing a new mix of Beatles songs. The late 60s is when they shined the most and were at their most original.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is truly another example of how the networks can indeed create fatastic entertainment, and not realize it until well after they cancel the series. <br /> <br />The characters are complex, and they develop extremely well during the 14 episodes.  The action is well done, and I found myself shouting \\"Yeah!\\" many times when instead of the usual expected response to a situation, they did exactly what you have always wanted someone in that situation to do.
B000002IZM|5.0|I can`t imagine the movie without this music.It just makes the movie one hundred times better and gives it a touch of mystery because most of the tracks are dark but finally beautiful.This could easily be entitled Future Chillout Vol.5 or something like that and people would still love it anyway.The music featured here by Vangelis is very complex,filled with fx and analog synths,composed in a non conventional way.That`s why everyone is surprised when you tell them this is a 1982 creation.There`s just one track that is quite different to the others called One more kiss dear that seems to be out of place, but it`s nice anyway.Unlike other reviewers, i like the movie dialogs in the tracks because they remind me the good scenes.The new tracks appear to sound a bit more polished production that the old ones, or at least they seemed to be composed later but that does not matter overall.Listening to this is an incledible relaxing experience.Like bubble bath but cheaper and more mystical.You will need to get good headphones if you want to get the best of it.Buy it and prepare to be blown away.
630018403X|5.0|5 high school students are locked up in detention on a saturday. Doesn't sound like a really great basis for a movie now does it? But not only did someone make a movie out of it, but made one of the most popular movies of the 80's. Back in the 80's, I had several hundred pen pals, and most of them, like me, loved this movie. It has the usual types of characters you'd normally see in high school(a preppy, a goon, a loon, a nerd, and a jock). If you are hoping to see a movie with a lot of blood and guts, and orgies,  you'll be disappointed, but if you like terrific dialogue (which is what this movie contains the most of), you're sure to love this film. There's a little bit of action, and a small seasoning of suspense, but not overdone. They are supposed to stay in the library with their mouths shut until time to leave. But of course this doesn't happen, and what does happen when these people of various backgrounds spend time together makes this movie very much worth watching.
B00005JLXE|1.0|...this is the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. I don't know much about the comic book itself, but the movie was quite boring and lame actually. Batman, Spider Man, X-Men and Superman movies are far better. Well except for the exception of Batman and Robin which was terrible. Arnold SCHWARZENEGGER as Mr. Freeze?! WTF? Kind of like Ben Affleck as any comic book character. I enjoy him in Kevin Smith films and that's about it. Especially Chasing Amy (His best performance). His acting in Dare Devil was just kind of dull.<br /><br />The action is not very exciting. The scene where he flips around slowly was copied off of Spider Man. This movie just didn't excite me very much. I couldn't get into it at all. For a comic book movie it didn't really have that great of special effects. The main villian (Played by Michael Clark Duncan, who is a pretty cool actor) wasn't evolved very well.<br /><br />As a film it wasn't enjoyable at all. Maybe if I was a fan of the comics...
0385510454|2.0|I was so pleased after reading The Last Juror, Mr. Grisham's previous novel.  I felt he was returning to the excellent storytelling he exhibited in A Time to Kill & The Firm.  Unfortunately, The Broker does not live up to this promise.  It seemed to move very slowly for much of the book.  I kept waiting for something to happen and then realized I only had 40 pages to read yet and still nothing had really happened!  I felt no sympathy for the main character nor for his plight, as he was being hunted down by everyone and their cousin.   He wasn't a very nice man and I didn't find any real revelation in his character that would indicate he had made some sort of turnaround.  I found myself sympathasizing more for Luigi, the main character's \\"handler\\" and for Teddy Maynard, the CIA head, than for the main character.   I hope Mr. Grisham's next book shows more promise and has more of an interesting story line.
B000001FA4|5.0|I`ll be sincere.I don't like a single thing concerning U2 since  Achtung Baby.They simply ran out of complete creativity.But this recording is another story.It sounds atmosferic and original although being released in 1984.The Edge`s guitarwork is beginning to astonish everybody and this is the only album where we can guess that this is an Irish band with Irish roots wanting to make it big,and not a stadium filling monster.All the tracks impress with their honest intensity and emotion,something missing in later U2 releases except Achtung Baby.Yes,most of the good job is done by Brian Eno`s exquisite production but good songs are just good songs live,studio or unplugged,and this is the case.You won`t go wrong with this one.

B0006L0LOS|3.0|Ok, Halle Berry is a babe. Does her performance make Catwoman a success? Well, kind of but not really. Now I will agree with most reviewers that Michelle Pfeiffer is the better catwoman of the two but this movie is not Batman Returns people! In fact, it has nothing to due with Batman period which is probably why it received some negative reviews to begin with. I have not read the Catwoman comics so I don't know if this version of Catwoman is based on them or not. As for the film, it has it's corny moments which I won't spoil for anyone except for the scene that has a cat breathing magic fog into Halle's mouth in order to bring her back to life. Halle also has the moves of Catwoman (truthfully, I don't if it was her or special effects). Anyway, the movie overall in no way drags so you won't get board with it even if you decide you don't care for it. The dvd has good features to offer which is a plus for any movie. Again, I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer IS Catwoman but that's no reason to not give this movie a chance.
0061053147|4.0|The book provides a fascinating look into the trials and tribulations that was the making of Blade Runner.  The movie is easily Scott's best, and his relentless pushing of the cast and crew is a testament to his determination and vision.  Future Noir gives an in depth view of all the turmoil; the \\"various cuts debacle\\", the studio interference, the collaboration, and the omnipresent friction.   <br />It is worth the read but the writer's prejudices are just that.  This is not the most influential scifi made.  It was a quiet, intellectual scifi and I'm not sure it's influence can ever be quantified.  But I enjoyed it-actually it is my favorite scifi behind The Phantom Menace(that's a joke people)-and I enjoyed this book.
B0000004V2|5.0|When The Stone Roses was released it caused shock to almost all the music scene.It sounded fresh,revolutionary,and a mix of arrogant and tender at times.It took time for many to accept that  you either had to love or hate this record.I love it,although sometimes it is hard for me to dig so much mancunian psychedelia in a single session coming to mind the excesses of the Happy Mondays times.I mean John Squire was a guitar hero but sometimes he overshadows the rest of the band.Here the only bad thing. <br />Now, the complexity of the songwriting...Songs like I am the resurrection,Made of stone or  I wanna be adored are so rich,well produced well performed and well arranged that it would take U2 or Coldplay this life and further reencarnations to release songs of that quality and genius.I imagine notes flowing through the veins of this guys, not blood when they went to the studio.The drum tempo changes in the songs are amazing and vocals fit in perfectly.Now that`s what i call manchester music.Excellent! <br />P.S  If i`d talk about their second, i`d bash them a little bit but that`s another story.... <br />
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The '77 punk scene is known for bands like The Sex Pistols, The Damned, The Buzzcocks, and Chelsea. Better than all these bands was The Clash. It might have been the political lyrics, it might have been the mixture of reggae in their music, but something made the Clash much different than any other punk band. \\"London Calling\\" shows them leaving behind their punk roots and experimenting with many different styles of music, like jazz, pop, reggae, and new wave. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones are at their peak here as well. Few singers have managed to put so much passion and emotion into their voice as them. If you are looking to get into The Clash, start with the self titled, then move on to this masterpiece, and then \\"Give Em Enough Rope\\", as those three are the only Clash albums worth buying.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|I don't understand why to by a MP3 player if you can't put your favorite songs in it.  Great band and great music, but bad decision in doing a cd that you cant hear or play in your computer. I understand that illegal copies exist but also technology and I'm frustrating because I can't hear this album in my office or in my Mp3 player. To bad ...
B000000I3O|5.0|Collection Two is better produced, but this one is far better, as it contains much better songs, and that is saying alot, since there is not one Misfits song that sucks. Anyway, If you're looking to get into the Misfits, this is undeniably the place to start, as there are many tracks on here that aren't availible on the studio albums, such as \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Horror Business\\". Other highlights on the album are the previously unreleased versions of \\"Astro Zombies\\", \\"Skulls\\" and \\"Teenagers From Mars\\". If you get this collection and you like it, pick up Collection Two, and that should be enough. If you absolutely ADORE it (like I did), pick up \\"Walk Among Us\\" and the Box Set, and then you will have every Danzig era Misfits song except \\"In The Doorway\\", which you can download.
B0009K7RES|4.0|When I saw the announcement for this CD, I thought, \\"What's the point?\\"  The songs already exist on other CDs, and there is not even that one \\"never been released\\" song to be used as a justification for those that have to have every song from an artist.  The fact that this CD cost so little made me pick one up from the local Best Buy.<br /><br />I have the Shangri-La CD and listen to it often, so when I put this CD in my player I didn't expect much in the way of a change or difference from what I have come to expect from these songs..  I was wrong.  These songs being performed live are great!  There are some subtle differences in things like tone or prominence of voice versus instruments, nothing earth shattering, but enough to notice, and more importantly enough to have a preference as to which disc to play when listening to a certain song.<br /><br />This EP will be my choice to listen to \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\", \\"Back to Tupelo\\", \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" and \\"Everybody Pays\\", while the others are just as good as those on the Shangri-La CD.  The aforementioned songs are just so much better in terms of clarity and tone, over the previous renditions.  Maybe it is intangible, but for me they are more enjoyable on this disc.  One nice addition to this EP that did not come from the Shangri-La  CD is \\"Rudiger\\" which is a song about a stalker that Knopfler wrote after John Lennon was killed (according to his introduction to this song on his \\"A Night In London\\" DVD), and this version is much better than the one from his \\"Golden Heart\\" CD.<br /><br />I give this disc 4 out of 5 stars only because they put the weakest track from Shangri-la on it, \\"Donegan's Gone\\".  Given the limited space for an EP, they could have made the tract list better with one of the other great tunes from that first CD, and not this throw-away shuffle based on hero worship from Knopfler's boyhood.<br /><br />If you like Knopfler, the price is right for this collection that is just right for when you have a spare block of time for a mini-dose of great music.for a mini-dose of great music.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I won't bother going into a song by song review. This is a spectacular look at a band through their history, seeing a band progress from a start that put them at the top of the rock pantheon.  <br />Each member of Zep brought incredible amounts of talen to the table, and that is very well documented here. If you've ever doubted Led Zeppelin and all the hype behind them, this should put your skepticism to rest. Bonzo is on fire throughout this set, as is Page. Plant is one of our greatest singers, and he never falters. Jonesy plays his role, oftentimes in the background but he is equally a part of the ensemble as an excellent bassist and keyboardist. Frankly it is only that he plays backseat to the others that he's often overlooked, but this band would have not been the same without him. <br />What sums this dvd up for me is that while I've owned every Zep album, and know their music inside and out, I'd never much cared all that much for Achilles Last Stand off Presence. Watching this blistering rendiditon performed live I'll never look at that song the same again. I'm probably preaching to the choir with this review, but Led Zeppelin gave us a lasting example of what rock music can aspire to. Believe the hype, Led Zeppelin were and will always symbolize the power of rock.
B0000025RI|5.0|This album set MJ as a standard not to do worse than this sadly he wasn't able to match \\"Thriller\\" but he was close a couple times.  He is a great artist in his own right and he was found innocent of all charges that he was accused of so their should be no harm.  Just listen to his music not to what the tabloids say or what the 5:00 news says \\"Thriller\\" is now close to 60 million copies world wide sold! MJ will never led up and hsi music will continue to sell that way it is becuase he is a musical genuis.  His music will soothe you in a way no one has ever had You would want to get up and dance like their is no tomorrow to MJ!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The third season of Gilmore Girls resolves alot of issues but also leaves us with a few new situations, especially the anticipation of Rory's first year at Yale. The only episode I didn't like was Here Comes the Son (the one that focused on Jess to promote his spinoff that never happened.) I really enjoyed the Thanksgiving episode! <br /> <br />I, for one, love the quick pace of the show and the witty banter. I think that's what makes the show so interesting. And it was said in the first season DVD extras that they talk so fast because their scripts are so much longer than the average tv show. <br /> <br />I can't wait for the release of the Season 4 DVDs!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I love this CD in and out I'll proberly where at the bottom of it soon. SHe expresses her self and creates well good written songs.  Every single track is good well performed..
B0000085N4|5.0|The Cult found themselves enveloped in a wave of expectations as they entered the studio in September of 1988. Their previous album \\"Electric\\" had been a surprise hit and subsequently earned them praise with the hard rock crowd starved for guitar licks from a Marshall turned up to 11. Interestingly, \\"Electric\\" had left fans of 1985's \\"Love\\" unsatisfied and wanting more of Billy Duffy's spacey, flanged guitar parts and Ian Astbury's gothic poetry. Therefore, The Cult had not one but two musical demographics to mollify in the autumn of 1988. Enter \\"Sonic Temple\\": a truly rich hybrid of gothic new-wave music and muscular hard rock riffing from a Les Paul. What is striking at first is how dynamic the album sounds; It isn't static like \\"Electric\\" and not quite as watery as \\"Love\\", thus it is it's own monster: A true product of The Cult and not their influences. Nowhere is this more evident than on the album's lead-off song \\"Sun King\\", where Astbury proclaims \\"This is where it all begins\\", only to be followed by an absolute explosion of sound from the guitars and rhythm section. Astbury's lyrics on \\"Sonic Temple\\" are intensely dynamic and range from sounding like a dog in heat to the introspective musings of Warhol scenester Edie Sedgewick. Billy Duffy also shines on \\"Sonic Temple\\", ripping out a few leads that would've impressed the shred crowd (particularly on \\"Sun King\\" and \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\"). His guitar sound is also much more textured than on \\"Electric\\" and has alot more width in the mix (undoubtedly because there is reverb on the guitar signal, unlike the super-dry Gretsch). What this all amounts to however is a well-produced hard rock album with alot of character and dynamics. You can forget about being pounded by the same tempo for 12 songs. I think this album should be considered one of the greatest of the 1980's. Period. Take a chance and try it yourself though.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I love their Greatest it covers everything they did and more! THey have such talent specially in their prime in the 70's they were it back then and I love their stuff.  With the sweet trumpet, Key boards, and vocals.  Earth Wind & Fire have some R&B and Funk Mixed together so perfectly!
B0000085N4|5.0|this is one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. there is no filler- every one of these songs deserved airplay on every FM station at the time.    my particular favorite is \\"soul asylum\\"- listen to this and hear them channeling led zeppelin.    perhaps the most underappreciated hard rock group of all time, and the most underappreciated metal album of all time.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney Houston had probelly one of the best debut albums in the 80's, but this album is much more than that. THis album is amazing with her great vocals.  She has a alot of ballads the best ballads are \\"YOu Give Good Love\\", \\"Greatest Love Of ALl\\", \\"Saving All My Love For You\\", and \\"Thinking About You\\" Those are the stand out ballad tracks but still every song is listenable! Her one great dance song on the album is \\"How Will I Know\\" My personal favorite.  This album hit #1  for 14 weeks straight on the billboard charts and was certified 12x platuim which means it sold around 12 million at that time . To this date \\"Whitney Houston\\" the ablum sold approx 28 million albums world wide. GO WHITNEY!
B0009K7RES|5.0|I am unabashed fan of Mark Knopfler. I think these tracks capture the gift of his musicality as well as anything he has done. <br /> <br />If you've seen him perform live you will love this. <br /> <br />There is an edge here lacking in some of the studio work, an altogether great effort...
B0000026WD|5.0|With hit serious of hits \\"Dangerous\\" the album is a powerful one. <br />\\"Dangerous\\" the album hit #1 on the billboard charts for 4 weeks straight and when to be 6x platuim.  It would Eventually sell 30 million copies world wide to date.  With his biggest on the album \\"Black or White\\" hit # 1 for 7 weeks straight.  And other hits such as \\"Remember the Time\\" \\"Jam\\" \\"In the Closet\\" and \\"WHo is it\\" Also his little anthem \\"Heal the World\\" and two other great songs are \\"Give in to Me\\" followed by \\"Dangerous \\" self-titled song.  \\"SHe Drives Me wild\\" is a nice up tune song and \\"Will you be there\\" This ablum represents the early 90's well done Mr. Jackson on a good album.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|After listening to this record I didn't know what had just happened to me.  This album is epic, psychedelic, and sounds like music you'd hear on the planet mars.  I'd say this album is more like one big song, there aren't any stand out tracks, with the exception of \\"The Widow\\", which was probably recorded to sell as a single. If you like Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin mixed with a Latino flavor and pinches of hard rock, this record is perfect for you. This is the best music I've heard in ages.  <br /> <br />You are obviously reading reviews to determine if this record is worth buying, it's worth it.
B0008ISM40|5.0|After not hearing anything about Nine Inch Nails for a while I just happened to pass by this CD and bought it on the spot.  Why??  Because I have never been disappointed in anything from Trent Reznor and still haven't.  This CD brings you back (in a way) to Pretty Hate Machine while still remaining its own style.  Every song on this album is breathtaking and explicit (in its emotional levels).  I have never had my emotions played with as much as when I am listening to NIN.  From the first day of its release I have played it from beginning to end and have not had to touch my stereo to hear one of my favorites.  Every song is great.  I have to say though, buy the dualdisc.  The 5.1 experience is like no other.  The only album with better surround is Fixed.  Yes the DVD features are not all that I had hoped they would be, but the 5.1 is what I was after anyways (and it was only a couple bucks more).  I am not going to go into a review of every song, because you would get tired of reading \\"Great track!\\" and \\"Excellent musicality\\" and blah blah blah.  There just wasn't one track that I didn't like.  END.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Does anyone have any information concering the battle theme when Beatrix Kiddo severs Sofie's in the fight at the House of Blue Leaves? I have looked all over the place. I can't believe it was left out. It reminded me of the music played in Conan the Barbarian when Thulsa Doom's henchmen come face to face with a Conan they thought they had killed - just like Kiddo.
0553573403|5.0|I know next to nothing about genre fantasy writing, as my taste leans toward literary fiction and narrative history.  After two non-fantasy readers urged me to read GRRM, I gave it a stab, after GAME OF THRONES sat unread on my shelf for a full year.  From the first chapter (not so much the prologue) I was hooked.  I missed my subway stop more than once.  I stayed up way past my bedtime.  I let work slide in favor of one more chapter.  Martin's characters are nuanced and real, his blacks and whites are black and white but his greys are sublime.  His grasp of \\"real politik\\" is as current and trenchant as that of a fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations.  He is the real deal.  I will now drop everything and read the rest.  I can't say this will convert me to the genre, but it has made me a loyal citizen of Westeros.  I do wish the fantasy publishers would occaisionally jacket their titles sans cheesey graphics but I suppose that would be asking to much.  Another friend turned me on to Orson Scott Card's ENDER series and those jackets are just as bad.<br /><br />Bravo George R. R. Martin, and curse you, as you've thrown a serious wrench into my reading plans for the next couple of months.
0141301120|4.0|I highly anticipated reading this book once I found out it existed.  I was somewhat let down at first because the first few chapters seemed to move kind of slow.  The book began to pick up with Chapter 4, which was pretty funny.  It was mostly just the President calling a bunch of Chinese people on the phone who had puns for names.<br /><br />The first half of the book was about battling an alien race in outer space.  I didn't find it terribly original or creative, except for the part where the aliens formed a chain.  I was kind of bored through a good chunk of the first half, so I would give it three stars.<br /><br />The second half of the book though has to do with making old people young and young people old and what happens when you go too far either way.  This part of the book was very interesting and I think only Dahl was creative enough to write something like this, especially with his explanation on how once you become younger than zero, you go to Minusland (similar to Hell).  There's even a song about laxatives that I thought I'd never see from the Oompa Loompas.  I give the second half of the book five stars.<br /><br />I never read the first book, but this one was pretty dated.  It was made in 1972, and it's big on the space craze.  I've never been big on the space craze, after watching hour after hour of boring astronaut films, so I get tired of space stuff pretty easily.  I still made it through the space part of this book though.<br /><br />I can still picture in my mind what the movie of this would have looked like.  It definitely didn't have the special effects to be made back in the 70's, unless it was made so you'd REALLY have to use your imagination.  Maybe the new film out will also make a sequel with a plot similar to this book.  I don't see it happening though.  The book is good, but not THAT good.
0316172324|4.0|\\"Blink\\" is a fun book that provides an exploration into our first impressions. Of particular interest is how certain individuals can make correct, decisive, rapid fire decisions under conditions of high pressure and limited information. Gladwell explores how we reach these conclusions using our conscious - a logical and definitive path - and our subconscious - the adaptive path.<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" not only explores the positive outcomes of the quick decision (at a glance) but also those decisions where our subconscious (instincts) betray us.<br /><br />This power of knowing, the subject at hand, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few but an ability we can all cultivate for ourselves. Gladwell discusses how it affects our relationships, our impressions of people, and how we evaluate circumstances that we face - both the familiar and the strange.<br /><br />You now have enough information, although limited, - in a blink -  to make a decision on whether or not this book is for you...
0141301155|4.0|When I was a child, I read this book over and over.  My sister was required to read it for school and since she had a learning disability with her reading, I ended up reading it to her and enjoyed the friendship we shared then.  It is something we both remember vividly.  I recently bought a new copy to read to my own five children and they are enjoying it just as much as I did.  They love it. <br /> <br />The reason I put only 4 stars though is that I loved the original illustrations better than the ones Quentin Blake has drawn.  I miss the picture of Prince Pondicherry in his melted chocolate house.  He also left out an important picture.  In the beginning, he has the pictures for each of the people in Charlie's house.  Unfortunately, he left out the picture of all four grandparents in the bed together where Roald Dahl writes, \\"Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephina on this side.  Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina on this side.\\"  Mr. Dahl wrote it along with the original illustrator so that those sentences would be put underneath the correct sides of the bed.  It confused my kids when I read that since there was no right or left indicated in the book and no picture to go with the words.  They asked, \\"Which side?\\" and I had to go back and let them look at the other pictures of the grandparents and point out the sides for them. <br /> <br />All together though, this is a great book for kids who have wonderful imaginations.  While reading this book, I have a house that is mostly quiet and that is very rare with 5 kids.
B000001FS3|5.0|I love U2. Bono has such a great voice. This album is my first U2 album I bought. My sister had this album on the orignal tape back in 1987. The songs on this album have stood the test of time. Where The Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, With Or Without You and Running To Stand Still are the most memorable to me. Others include Bullet The Blue Sky, In God's Country, One Tree Hill and Exit. Red Hill Mining Town and Trip Through Your Wires are great too. Mothers Of The Disappeared WAS NOT on the orignal tape, but it makes a better closer. For those of you who like all the great vocalists or 80's music, get this album. If your thinking about starting a U2 collection get this album first. It will leave you wanting more!!
1573223026|5.0|How could you possibly expect anyone to top \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy\\"? Nick Hornby has really hit his stride with this novel. Like all his stuff, it is a million things at once, funny, sad, ugly and beautiful. As I read this book I just kept shaking my head because the characters were becoming so real to me and I was starting to love each one of them, huge flaws and all. What an accomplishment and what a remarkably fresh voice this writer has. I LOVED IT.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Rob Halford is back! This genious band has returned to it's glory. One of the best CDs of their career. It makes you wonder what we have missed out on since Rob's departure so long ago. If this is the present and future, the Priest are truly still the Metal Gods. Get Electric Eye on DVD too. Welcome back to the Passion of the Priest.

0780626966|4.0|basically lets see...um <br /> <br />number 1: is definately a classic by far <br /> <br />number 2: is probably the worst in the series as the use of elm street kids are nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br />number 3: is ok but needed more character development  <br /> <br />number 4: probably has the most killings in it however i hated the fact they kill off the three remaing elm street kids so early in the movie. <br /> <br />number 5: is alright but needed a better ending and it drags on alot. <br /> <br />number 6: is the 2nd worst in the series i thought horror was meant to be scary not funny and the made alot of errors in the movie if you watch it yu will find them. <br /> <br />number 7: one of the best installments makes you wonder what is reality and what is a dream. wes has gone back to the horror roots ie. use of strings not rock music like in previous movies and the return of heather langenkamp and john saxon makes it better <br /> <br />altogether i its a good horror franchise worth while buying it's a must have for your collection. <br /> <br />And TRUE EVIL NEVER DIES freddy will be back
B00006FDCJ|5.0|clint eastwood is my favorite western actor, he is so solid in this movie, i absolutely loved the dvd set, it is a great gift idea for anyone who loves westerns
B0007TKH66|4.0|I think that there is way too much pessimism concerning Enterprise. I recently bought this set and thouroughly enjoyed it. (I never had payed attention to it when it aired on TV). I love Scott Bakula and really enjoy the relationship between Archer and Trip (reminds me of Kirk and Bones). I really like the whole concept of the temporal cold war, I think think that they could have made a whole other Trek series with the concept. I enjoy some of the stories, for example, Strange New World is cool because Trip starts to \\"trip out\\" when he is under the influence of psychotropic chemicals. I also love the scene when Trip and Malcolm are in a club on Risa looking for ladies (other Treks didn't portray a couple of guys on shoreleave). I agree with another customer who wrote that the next series should have a fresh start with new writers. I know that there are plenty of Trekkers out there who would love to give new ideas on a series and plot lines.....have we explored Section 31 to its fullest potential? Anyways, I think Trek should take a little break and come back strong with some new talent and get some more publicity.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I tend to be a very picky person when it comes to music. Unfortunately, the good artists are difficult to find these days, and I have a limited collection of artists, including Alison Krauss and + Union Station, Josh Turner, and Joe Nichols. While this makes me a very loyal fan, I do enjoy variety every once in awhile. Celtic Woman gave me this and so much more. <br /> <br />I never believed anybody could sing as beautifully as these women did at the concert in Dublin. I want more every time listen to them, and their music never seems to get old, no matter how much I listen to the CD.  <br /> <br />My favorites are \\"Send Me a Song\\" by Ms. Kelly, \\"Walking in the Air\\" by Ms. Agnew, \\"The Butterfly\\" by Ms. Nesbitt, and \\"Si Do Mhaimeo i\\" by Ms. Ni Maolchatha. All the other songs blew me away, as well! <br /> <br />What I thought was also incredible was how, while they sounded great alone, they were beautiful together. A lot of groups can't say that. Even groups who sound good together couldn't match the sound that the five women make together. <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|If George Clooney said that he had killed the Batman franchise, Chistian Bale had revived it.<br /><br />In fact it is not truly fair to say George Clooney killed the franchise because the last series of franchise were killed by greed and bad screenplay. Michael Keaton was unhappy with the direction the seies went and decided not to reprise the third time. History proved that he was right. Nonetheless, Batman Begins breathed new air into this stagnant fossilised franchise and brought it back to life.<br /><br />Batman begins adopted the same dark tune that Tim Burton had set for the series but the emotion in this one is even darker. There was an in depth study of Bruce Wayne and Batman's psychology that departs itself from the last two movies. In the first one, we had the unwilling hero and in the second one we had the lover-enemey relationship between Batman and Catwoman. In the third and the fourth one, the villains had taken over the limelight with technology leaving two empty shells for the audience to wondering what is actually happening.<br /><br />The childhood memories and haunting of Bruce Wayne had led him into complete emotional and psychological breakdown. He could not face himself nor anyone he knew. He chose an exiled life and prepared to complete the cycle by punishing bad guys in the jail, which he got himself into. He was \\"rescued\\" by a mysterious man who eventually unfolded a series of events that Bruce had never thought of. The respect and pain relationship between Liam Neeson and Christian Bale was well portrayed and written; nonetheless Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman got the best lines in the movie. Katie Holmes had been overshadowed not by Tom but by the lack of performance she could have in the movie. Despite that she is the only lead, she is hardly \\"leading\\" the story in any sense. There are quite a number of other baddies in the movie but most of them didn't really make their mark in the movie, except maybe for Cillian Murphy who played the villain doctor.<br /><br />The main difference of Batman Begins from other similar movie is the abandonment of extensive CGI for effects. As the actors themselves said, Batman is never a superpower hero so it doesn't make sense to have a lot of CGI to do the stunts while they are not difficult to do by the actors themselves. The product was series of fast paced fighting and melee scenes that could leave an impression in your mind. The gadgets are popular and well know gadgets but they were well used and well explained scientifically in the movie. Like the way they explained about the cape. The Batmobile was a bit stylishly clumsy but it served its purpose of originally designed as a battle tank. If you want to find flaws, it would be some illogical bits in the movie like why if the whole construction on top of a snow mountain exploded, there was no avalanche following? Also how come all of a sudden a mountain resident who never uttered a word of English could speak a line in fluent English? Nonetheless they are just minor stuff and actually if you don't care, they are quite amusing.<br /><br />The movie ended with a very good link to the first Batman movie that could play the music in your heart.<br /><br />In all Batman Begins is a successful reinstalment of the franchise and unless Warner Bros committed the wrong choice again to kill it off, it could well leave good credentials for the franchise to survive in the current generation of movie goers.ayed the villain doctor.  <br /> <br />The main difference of Batman Begins from other similar movie is the abandonment of extensive CGI for effects.

B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" is one of the best CDs i've every heard. All of thier songs are modern but have an 80's spin, which i can see why most adults like them. I don't really understand why the killers are not as popular here, in America, as they are in England. The Killers are one very talented group and are very glamerous live as well. Anyone who has not bought Hot Fuss, should really think of looking into it. This is one great album that in the future will be hard to stumble across again.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|Mighty Rearranger is a treat for the senses. The songs vary in tone from soft and pretty to loud and furious, sometimes shifting tempo in mid song, as they churn and draw you in. Robert Plant's voice is in fine form, especially on the excellent \\"Shine It All Around\\". Pretty melodies, poetic lyrics and crisp production create a mesmerizing tapestry of sound that gets better and better with repeated listenings.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Leaving behind the heavy crazy maddness S>O>A>D is known for, they pt in great melodies and extremely good lyrics. and instead of listening to BYOB, there are different songs for you to enjoy. Revenga may be one of the greatest songs of all time, and Lost in Hollywood has some of the greatest lyrics in hard rock history. (All you maggot smoking fags on Hoolywood Blvd. is my facorite line). Though this is a great album, what I can't wait for is Hypnotise, their new album that is coming out this fall! So bckle up because S>O>A>D is taking you on aride you will never forget...

B0009I7NNA|4.0|Instead of screaming their lungs out like their first album, or using all of their anger up in the second, A.S comes up with a good album. This time, they took their cool lyrics, and combinded them with the awsome rythems of Anthrax, and (surprisingly to me), mixes it up wit some Led Zepplin. Their song Streingth of the World sounds exactly like Led Zepplin's Stairway to Heaven, though not as good. But like all A.S albums, their songs are fricken long, so try to stay awake, or you'll miss out on something surprisingly good.
B000002H97|4.0|I've heard it said before that after \\"...And Justice For All\\" (which is my personal favorite Metallica album), Metallica knew that they had taken technical thrash as far as it could go, and that they had to take the next album in a different direction. And whoo boy, did they ever! So, this is the album that Metallica had to make. Yeah, I guess that you could say that Metallica sold out with this album, and let's face it, everything only got worse from here. But I like this album anyway.    When it all comes down to it, about half of this album is forgettable filler. But the other half is absolutely essential. \\"Enter Sandman\\" is a great song and a classic, \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are awesome power ballads, \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" is one of my favorite Metallica songs ever recorded, and \\"Through The Never\\" and \\"Holier Than Thou\\" aren't half bad either. I simply skip the rest. So yeah, that's my advice. It's a landmark album, no doubt about that, and like I said, it's the album that Metallica absolutely had to make. Will you enjoy it? I couldn't say, because everyone's so polarized over it. All I know is, I like it just fine.
B00023BLXK|3.0|Maybe it is me...or I am just crazy...but personally, I like the orignial DD better than this installment.  Yes, it had some decent music, but not the best.  The original had better music, just my opinion.  Ok, for the story...the story of the main characters is very interesting, and did keep my interest somewhat.  I found that the story was a bit draggy, but the ending was something to be desired.  The film failed to really wrap things up, and kinda left ppl hanging in the end. As for the actors overall performance in this film, everyone did a good job, but no one really stood out in the crowd for me. Good dancing, to be had by all, but overall this movie could have been a bit better, hence the 3 stars!
B00003CX8Y|4.0|After I purchased this version, and viewed it for the first time on DVD instead of VHS... I immediately realized the colour differences.  It was disapointing to me, that a once appropriately dark film was now brightened, taking away from the more serious mood they once had.  I suppose parents would argue that children prefer bright colours, which may be true, but it definitely takes away from the origonal classic look.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento\\") takes the helm for the latest entry in the successful (\\"Fading,\\" my a--, though I haven't seen \\"Batman Returns\\" or \\"Batman Forever\\") franchise, steering it away from the first 4 movies, thus re-inventing the Dark Knight for a new generation. The acting was excellent on all levels (Oscar-winners Morgan Freeman, also doing some voice-over work in Steven Spielberg's awesome remake of H.G. Wells' classic sci-fi novel \\"War Of The Worlds\\" [see my review on it], and Michael Caine appear as Lucius Fox and long-time \\"Batman\\" staple Albert, the butler, providing the comic relief when neccessary). Katie Holmes (best-known as the love interest in \\"Dawson's Creek\\") does a great job as Bruce Wayne's love interest, aside from being another pretty face. Christian Bale (the little boy in Steven Spielberg's \\"Empire Of The Sun\\" and the \\"Boy\\" in Kenneth Branagh's \\"Henry V\\" [see my review on it]) has come a long way since then, turning in a ferocious, yet completely believable, performance as Bruce Wayne. Liam Neeson (best-known as Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's epic \\"Schindler's List\\" [see my review on it]), Ken Watanabe (the samurai leader in \\"The Last Samurai\\") and screen villian Gary Oldman, doing a 360-degree turn, bring up the supporting cast...and do it very well. All I can say is, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!! Why not cast Tom Cruise as the villain in the next film? Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento,\\"<br />\\"Insomnia\\") opts for a darker take on the origins of \\"The Bat Man,\\" thus creating the atmosphere for an emotionally gripping, more stylized version of Bob Kane's immortal comic book creation, ditching the campiness of the first four (unless you count the 1966 \\"Batman\\" film, which was based on the 1960's TV series) movies. The scene where Rachael (Ms. Holmes) literallt slaps some sense into Bruce should've been extended and ended a little differently, but screenwriter David S. Goyer had the right idea, choosing to further explore the here-to-fore uncharted reasons that drove Bruce to becoming \\"The Dark Knight.\\" The small scene where Rachael is protecting a little boy also should've been extended, but it probably would've driven the movie way off track, however further it would have developed her character.

1400049628|1.0|[...]as being along the same lines, could be such a bad read, especially for a fan of zombie movies like myself. A few of the minor problems are things like the fact that the author ditches traditional zombie rules like death by beheading that were set in place by Goerge Romero, generally considered the father of zombie movies; another thing that bothered me is how the classic zombie-killing combo of the shotgun and chainsaw were regarded by this book as inferior to a rifle and crossbow, even if the argument was supplemented with logic; perhaps worst of all are the constant references to \\"Sol-something\\", the author's name for the zombie virus that was, as far as I know, purely his own invention. All of these things are minor, and only true nerds would care, much less notice. The main problem with this book is it's far too bland. It reads like a textbook on something that doesn't exist. It's dry humor was only actually humorous for about thirty seconds (at the very first I considered maybe he actually believed in zombies) and then I just got pissed at how I had to drag myself through each page. Honestly, this book is well-written, but only enjoyable for people who can laugh at a non-fiction style documentary of zombies for the hours it takes to read the entire book. Sadly, I am not one of them.
6304696566|2.0|This is the poorest of John Wayne's otherwise memorable roles as the Western Hero. The typical John Wayne character is long on courage, honor, and integrity and short on words, patience, and silliness. He does not suffer fools gladly. He is quick-witted and quick-handed with either his lever action or six-gun. Unfortunately, that exciting hero doesn't emerge in this story.<br /><br />At the risk of offending the critics, I suggest that this film falls far short of the Duke's many other wonderful western tales.<br /><br />Ethan Edwards is an angry jerk, teetering on the brink of losing self-control and reason. His mysterious past and role in the failed campaign of the Confederate army have caused him to become a bitter, isolated man filled with rage. Now his hatred and vengance are directed at the Comanche who have abducted his niece. His anger boils over frequently at his hapless traveling companion, Jeffrey Hunter, who couldn't tie his own shoelaces without help. The story full of idiots: Charlie the mailman trying to woo Laurie who has the good sense to resist him, Moses the nutty cowboy in search of a rocking chair, and the captain/preacher who isn't sure if he's out to save the world or kill it.<br /><br />The acting is just awful. It is absurdly corny and stilted. This film is tedious until the viewer is finally rewarded for his patience by the ending of the dreary mess.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|NO joke--when putting the cd into my computer--simply to hear the music, not even copy, it locked up when trying to download a bunch of software that provided licenses or something to allow me to listen to a cd I had just purchased. Long story short (and after spending 45 minutes on the phone with the head of technology of the company who develops the s/w), I had to reinstall the operating system on my pc to get it functioning again. UNBELIEVABLE!!! I JUST WANTED TO LISTEN TO THE CD I BOUGHT!!! The music industry doesn't get it. Next time--I'll download it for free.
B000000OF6|4.0|A rather impressive 2 disc release spanning the career of Queen, a misinterpreted but nevertheless sensational rock band. The 2 discs are divided amongst the early era Queen(disc #1) and the late-era Queen(disc #2). An incredible compilation for those of us who aren't as familiar with the band Queen as we wish we were, however does it do justice to the diehards who know every bit of the music that Queen ever wrote and produced? Please read on for my review in which each Disc will be reviewed seperately.<br /><br />To review Disc 1, well it is my choice, hands down as the better of the 2 for the simple fact that Queen produced far superior music in the 70s and very early 80s compared to the latter half of their career(in my opinion). Bohemian Rhapsody and Another One Bites The Dust open as the biggest of hits for the band, and from that point on we here some essential classics, mainly covering a great deal of pop tunes including Killer Queen, Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy(anyone who says this shouldn't be on here, I'm coming to get you!), Play The Game and You're My Best Friend respectively. All beautiful melodies that all fans of music should appreciate, also Somebody To Love and We Are The Champions could be placed in that pop category, with their sensational heart-felt melodies. Also, we have a few rock powerhouses including the typical live rocker Now I'm Here and We Will Rock You. However, they have left out an absolute essential in the field of rocking tracks from the 70s era by not placing Tie Your Mother Down on this track listing. Seven Seas Of Rhye is the only song taken from Queen II, and it compliments the disc nicely. However, no justice whatsoever is given to Queen's debut album as they failed to place Keep Yourself Alive on here.<br /><br />Disc 2 has chosen very well each track, featuring a songlisting that ranges from the Hot Space album back in 1982 to Innuendo(1991). I'll just cover the crucial errors(in my mind) on this disc. Breakthru should never have been stuck on here. It is in my opinion the weakest single released off The Miracle album, and either Scandal would've fit better, or perhaps These Are The Days Of Our Lives from the Innuendo album. Friends Will Be Friends is also a questionable selection which could have easily been replaced by the less sappy One Year Of Love or the rock force Princes Of The Universe. There are some great tracks though on this disc and I'm very glad to see It's A Hard Life on here. The real keepers though would have to be Radio Ga Ga, Show must Go On, Under Pressure, and Innuendo. The rest of the selections are strong with great contributions coming from Hammer To Fall, I want To Break Free and I'm Going Slightly Mad.<br /><br />Well, in summary, I definitely think there were a few untimely misfires in the selections, but of course it would be rather difficult to pick and choose 34 tracks for 2 discs and have everyone happy. Nevertheless, I wouldn't highly recommend this package, but instead suggest Greatest Hits(Hollywood) and Classic Queen, bought seperately. Now, that might be a stretch however for some casual fans, as this route would be cheaper. Therefore, I can only leave it up to the buyer to decide. But if you are impressed with a greatest hits compilation by Queen, I urge you to go back and check out some of their studio albums, particularly those from the 70s where many hidden gems lie, and some magnificent, out-of-world music will reveal itself to you.never have been stuck on here.

0786856297|5.0|The idea for this book is a natural:   Say the Greek gods (Zues, Poseiden, Ares, etc.) were real and still with us. Legend tells us those gods had children with mortals in the past (especially Zues), so why not write a book about one of those kids in modern day America?   You can't deny Percy Jackson has some things in common with a certain young wizard we've all heard of. Percy doesn't know he is a demi-god at first. Once he finds out he's half god he has to discover how to use his latent powers. He has reliable chums (a satyr named Grover and a child of Athena's named Annabeth) he meets at Camp Half-Blood, which is a summer camp for demi-gods. The friends accompany him on a cross-country quest for Zues' lightning bolt and there's magic and monsters around every corner including a Minotaur, Medusa, and the Furies.   Even if it does owe something to Harry Potter, The Lightning Thief is still original and fun.  Using Greek myths gives the whole thing a fresh spin. And Percy, his friends, and their adventures have thier own personalities and style.  Their journey actually takes them all the way to Hades!  It's all pretty fast paced and Percy likes to jump into action a lot.  And Percy has a unique family situation that gets an upbeat twist at the end.    So if you like Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, and anything at all that gives a younster's imagination wings, pick up a copy of The Lightning Thief.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|The Foo Fighters chose the ideal time to release an album like this, perfectly commercial with heavy hitters like Monkey Wrench, but also very innovative with original compositions like Everlong and balladic tracks like February Stars. The 2nd album from the Foo is much more complex arrangement wise compared to their straight forward rocking debut album. A great late 90s release displaying exceptional growth from Dave Grohl and the band, effectively using catchy guitar hooks surrounded by blistering lyrical deliveries.<br /><br />Opening with the soft, beautiful melody of Doll, The Colour And The Shape incorporates all the elements that make a great rock album. The single Monkey Wrench follows as track #2 very well, with vicious lyrical deliveries and an awesome guitar tune. Hey Johnny Park! is a big highlight, a strong rocker that also offers a very melodic side to it. My Poor Brain is an interesting track,  using melody twists between the song, translating into a gross rocker. Wind Up is a short rocker with a ferocious lyrical delivery and smashing drums. Up In Arms is hard to interpret, as it brushes along the side of fiery rock and also balladic pop. A good mix indeed. My Hero is a very well composed rocker, opening  with awesome drums. See You is the most unexpected track, almost posing similarities to The Beatles with its cheery melody. Enough Space is a screamy rock song, with Grohl delivering the lyrics in a squealing tone. February Stars is dynamically excellent, paced well to build up into a powerful rocking song. Many people I know suggest Everlong to be the best song the Foo Fighters ever did, and it's very difficult to disagree with them, as it carries such a catchy guitar riff. Walking After You sees Grohl exploring a soft side, writing a rather effective love song. New Way Home ends the album on a high point, a prolonged rocker.<br /><br />Overall, this album could arguably be called the high-point of the Foo Fighters career, however their latest release In Your Honor has an incredible acoustic disc, and their debut album remains classic to this day. A highly recommended release along with any other Foo Fighters album.release In Your Honor has an incredible acoustic disc, and their debut album remains classic to this day.

0440238609|3.0|The first novel in this series, \\"The Golden Compass,\\" is an exciting, intriguing, awesomely inventive adventure story that I would not hesitate to award five stars. It will leave you dying to know more about the world Philip Pullman has created, and for most of its relatively brief length, \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is a worthy continuation.    Unfortunately, the plot starts to unravel toward the end of the second book, and by the third, the author's anti-religion preaching takes center stage, leaving the plot and characters to tailspin out of control. Pullman doesn't seem to know (or even really care) how to resolve the many story threads he's been juggling, and the trilogy limps to a contrived, anticlimactic, unsatisfying ending. He writes himself into several corners, and the series' internal logic goes out the window as arbitrary new rules are created and characters behave in completely nonsensical ways just to keep the story going.    \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is so muddled and disappointing, you'd be better off skipping it and just imagining your own ending to Lyra and Will's story. Maybe if the author had been more concerned with maintaining the momentum and creativity of \\"The Golden Compass\\" instead of hammering home his condescending Christians-are-ignorant-sheep message, the rest of the trilogy might have lived up to the amazing first book.
B0000026UV|5.0|This is a nice album.  It has some good electric guitar playing.  You can tell that Chet and Mark had a fun time making this. There is the humourous \\"There'll Be Some Changes Made\\" with Chet considering some  upgrades.  The quiet 'So Soft, Your Goodbye', 'Sweet Dreams', 'Tahiatian Skies' and 'I'll See you in my Dreams'.  The closing song 'Next Time I'm in Town' makes me wish that they could have made another album together. Listening to two great guitar players, Chet and Mark, play off each other in words and on the guitar makes this album worth owning.

B00003CXXP|3.0|I believe there's a reason that reviews of AI are so confusing ... and often diametrically opposed.  AI, after all, is the result of a fusion of two directors' views of a single story; in this case, those directors could not be more different. So the sense that the story moves in different directions at different levels probably isn't just an optical or narrative illusion.<br /><br />Some dwell on a darker, ostensibly \\"Kubrickian\\" interpretation, probing for some trenchant, perhaps cynical theme to offset what appears to be a 20-minute final&eacute; of \\"Spielbergian\\" syrup.  The contortions they take to sell this notion are byzantine and seemingly at odds with Spielberg's carefully crafted, gooey finish.  To them, the end cannot be taken at face value and must be, itself, part of a larger fairy tale that advanced mechas (robots, to the rest of us) tell baby mechas, and that the sweetness of the ending (Pinocchio turns \\"real\\") must be a mocking tribute to the fantasies we tell our own children. That last piece -- the \\"mocking tribute\\" -- is the biggest stretch for me.<br /><br />Others, who generally dislike the movie, hone in on the juxtaposition (or, better yet, outright clash) between the first two acts (that end with David at the bottom of a flooded New York staring at a Coney Island-style blue fairy), and the warm and touching denouement in which the advanced \\"mechas\\" rescue David and, as technological blue fairies, grant his final wish: not just to spend a day with his \\"mother\\" (an \\"orga,\\" as opposed to a \\"mecha\\"), but to have her love him.  Indeed, in a replica home built from David's memories, his saviors appear and speak to him through an image of the blue fairy ... telling him what they can, and cannot, do to help him achieve his dream.  (Fortuitously, a lock of his mother's hair has been saved from which she might be cloned and returned to him.)  And so he spends a last day with a cloned version of his mother, who -- away from the influence of her \\"real\\" (orga) son -- has time enough to realize that she loves David, and finally says so. (How does the clone even remember him?  We're given some explanation about memories being contained in space-time, although it's pretty confusing and sounds, well, hokey.) Taken at face value, the story wraps up like a rich berry pie steaming on the sill of an open window on God's little half-acre.<br /><br />We can debate, I suppose, about whose take is right.  Certainly, Kubrick never saw a lick of this film, in draft of otherwise. And although Kubrick did, in fact, sketch the outlines of Act 3, there is little support for the view that the final 20 minutes of A.I. reflects Kubrick's intentions and tone. It simply doesn't feel like Kubrick, so the case for such a statement needs to be much stronger than I've heard. Perhaps getting a look at Kubrick's fabled 80-page treatment might help, but, for reasons unknown, it remains hidden (much like any director's commentary--Spielberg doesn't believe in them). Spielberg himself has studiously resisted disclosing how much of the end product was his and how much was Kubrick's, saying only that they had a common vision (with the subtext being that their views were so close perhaps as to be indistinguishable). I don't buy that. Spielberg and Kubrick were not on the same intellectual level:  Spielberg is no Kubrick, either in sophistication or vision.<br /><br />As for my two cents, Act 3 looks and feels like the now familiar Spielbergian cop-out.  On the surface, it plays like a commercial for fabric softener ... all aglow, with munificent and stylish Close Encounters-like robots (sometimes mistaken for aliens), and filled with tenderness and maudlin dialogue. It feels as if Spielberg couldn't live with Haley Joel Osment stuck at the bottom of the ocean staring, for eternity, at a false idol. (Many of us, cynics perhaps, thought that was the perfect ending: a priceless metaphor for our own, human infatuation with with artificial deities.)<br /><br />To be sure, the subject matter is rich, and intriguing references and anologies are peppered throughout the film.  Hinted, but never effectively explored, is notion of man's hubris, his becoming (at least in his own mind) a diety (recall Professor Hobby's line--when confronted about whether humans will be able to return the love of a robo-boy--about God having created Adam and Eve, in the first instance, to worship him). Similarly, the notion of man as god in the mythos of the machine swims in the AI stew but isn't well-explored. Compelling also, in a tragic way, is the advanced mechas' idea that humans hold the answer to the meaning of life. Finally, there is an elegance to the idea that we have endowed our creations with our own foibles, frailties, and insecurities ... first in David searching for the blue fairy (God) and ending with the advanced mechas telling the story of a  robot (God's son?) who came to their world to \\"save\\" them and, in the process, became \\"real.\\"  Meaty stuff.  Too bad the film simply doesn't live up to the challenge.<br /><br />In other words, AI is a well-intentioned film with lots of substance and even more potential. But it is so uneven and indecisive as to never really work at anything the way a masterful film should.  That is its greatest tragedy.and intriguing references and anologies are peppered throughout the film.

0060930187|5.0|Sylvia Plath is by far the most influential author in my book collection.  Inside of this novel is hidden the twisting vain of suicide and desperation.  Such is the imagery of her wording as well as the numb, lifeless character she expounds.   <br /> <br />I've read this text over and over again.  Nothing could make the pages dull.  They will always come alive...remain fresh. <br /> <br />
0452270073|5.0|I read the trilogy a few years ago after seeing it on the front page of amazon.uk. I had a grandfather who was in the great war. He was gassed. He later committed suicide in the front room of his house by refusing food. We don't talk about it much. I am disturbed when I think of this war shattered man who I am related to over a gap of 50 years. <br /> <br />I found this series uplifting, sad, funny and enjoyable. I felt that I understood more about my family - what happened to us and why. The prose is wonderous, the dialog good enough that you feel suspended in the room or on the battle field with these people, just as if you were behind the furniture or sitting in the trench nearby. Its about poetry, rebellion and death. Its about the horror of this world. Also it is about being human.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Mythology is good, but why would an insane man kill himself on a cross. Why wasn't he stoned to death like the culture of the Jews at that time. Also, what about the way in which the Romans actually killed people 2000 years ago, by hanging the cross up side down and burning the cross. I guess \\"Jesus\\" wouldn't been able to speak up side down, well the dramatics would have been senseless. Lots of hype for a crappie movie. \\" Jesus\\" go out and kill your self for the people today. HUH, sounds a little wack. I'll refer you to a better movie, \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\".
B00005JNJT|3.0|Some quote from the movie (or something like it): 'The reason why we fall down is because so that we would learn to pick ourselves up' -(no not Vader)Bruce Wayne's pops  <br /> <br />A monologue from the movie (or something like it as well): <br />Bruce Wayne to Michael Caine: 'Tell me Alfred, why do you give a damn so much?' <br />Alfred played by Michael Caine's answer: 'I give a damn - because your father intrusted me with something that is very important for him in our world.' <br /> <br />DC Comics' doomed BATMAN movies franchise shed its new skin with this yet another movie depiction of Bob Kane's classic cape crusading comic book hero, and most desperately so- being that the other rival comic book company is scoring well these days with its load of titles frolicking about in the movie industry since their campy tv equivalents back in the late 70's-- by stripping out the cheesyness and out-of-control production inspired by Tim Burton's creative yet confined vision in moviemaking, cutting out the commercial trimmings given with the actors chosen for the earlier movies and the cast of artists for the soundtrack on the movies (I guess the very first big mistake with the first Tim Burton film is that they commisioned The Artist Formerly Known as AFKAP to score the flick with that chessy BatDance, I said then they oughtta have U2 (being a big fan of the band) whom they did have for the third installment's soundtrack, but AFKAAFKAP ain't no Ray Parker Jr., if you know what I'm saying (sorry for the paraenthesisses)); and incorporating a more darker / serious approach which in this case is mainly propelled by Christopher Nolan who wrote and directed the film. Needless to say (and yet I'd state it such) It's Chris Nolan's baby. Welp, mainly... <br /> <br />Heir to the growing empire which his parents have left, blaming himself for the murder of his parents and haunted by his childhood fears for bats- This time we have Bruce Wayne (confined from an oriental prison cell) recruited by Qui Gon Jin, er.. a character played by Liam Neeson rather- from a secret society zealous with its concept of Justice, which reflect a lot more on what the Tarot cards' sentiments implies - total blind amoral justice, for the sake of justice, called the League of Shadows (nope, none of those from Dan Brown's flimsy novels) led by Rahs-Al Ghoul. Here, Wayne is subjected to a certain shot that's a bit like those of Miyagi and his apprentice, Daniel-san from that 80's movie classic -Karate Kid. But our dear Bruce (played not so impressively but good nuf by Christian Bale this time) had his own ideas, and thus the apprentice became a defiant vigilante under his own umbrella so-to-speak, the BATMAN came out of the shadows and thus commence what could be another string of movies gaping for box office appeal for the next years prospectively to come along our way. It is also a latter point in the plot that Bruce Wayne had to confront the very man who killed his parents, facing an appeal for bail- here, Nolan gave the character of BAts that resembles a lot like those which the Daredevil have suffered in the wake of its own Comic Book pages, specifically the 'BORN AGAIN' series, where the Kingpin- finding out about the true identity of blind lawyer MAtt Murdock, gave life a living hell for this other comic book company rival to DC's costumed hero - equivalent to this here DC's DArk Crusader. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Quite lenghty, and other than that sort of Talkish- this time we have BAtman's foe The Scarecrow as the featured villain for this first re-installment on this BATMAN flick. ANd obviously, on its next stop we are indicated by the film that it would be Bats' arch-nemesis The Joker that's to be featured in the next film. Jack Nickolson I hope he's not. However, the Scarecrow's depiction is the downer in this flick, not so impressive me thinks. <br />Oh, and yeah check out what happened with BAts' wheels we faintly remember as the BAtmobile. <br /> <br />For one thing, casting the presense of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson is a splendid thing and the actors played their characters well, and also there's Gary Oldman and somehow, Rutger Heuer's presence have gone to me unnoticed.  <br />Oh, and as for Tim Burton, he'd a remake of Roald Dahl's children classic CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, maintaining its title this time, featuring (who else?) Johnny Depp in the role of Willie Wonka, along another NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS-like flick titled CORPSE BRIDE. <br /> <br />and Lastly, another quote: <br />'Everybody falls down, it's just all about how fast you can get up again right' -sorry this time its from another movie, DRIVEN. <br /> <br />but here's one from this movie and from the Bats himself: <br />EASY READER: 'What's (the thing) with the bat?' <br />WAYNE as the BATS: 'I'm afraid of bats. It's time that I give them a fair share of my own fear.' <br /> <br />The PAssion of BATMAN it ain't <br /> <br />RATE: 7 0ut of 10 <br />
B0002XDODU|1.0|Awful. Just plain awful. A sorry attempt. <br /> <br />Believe it or not, most fans agree with my stance. The band did profit from RR (not as much as their other albums), but they LOST money all the singles attached to this album (except for Mein Teil). Thats right THEY LOST MONEY ON THESE SONGS. Thats why Los has been cancelled, and they are instead moving on to their new album, due out this year. They promise it will be much heavier, and will not letdown the fans like this album. <br /> <br />So in short, ditch this garbage, go buy Mutter, and download \\"Benzin\\". It is a song Rammstein just debuted in a concert setting from their newest album. I promise, once you hear it, it will restore your faith in this band!

This is what I think of the album: Not since Coheed and Cambria's IKSSE:3 (GREAT album by the way, better than this too ^_^) have I found a band who by their sophomore release have mastered the art of making pretty much EVERY chorus stick in your head; they're Huge, Catchy choruses, almost every one of them. If you like this kind of music but would like it with a more epic feel to it...well go get Coheed and Cambria's In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 :P But if you, like many people, can't get over their vocals, then get this. Heck get this anyways. Its a good album that your friends will recognize without you going nuts in the car - I usually don't like the flavor-of-the-week pop-punk type bands that this band is generally played with on FUSE, but this album in particular is good. <br /> <br />But IKSSE:3 is better. sorry, sorry; this is a solid album with only a few weak points, and is a welcome addition to any cd collection as long as you aren't afraid of your hXc music buddies seeing it.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Here in San Francisco the house was completely packed at the huge, sprawling IMAX cinema at Fourth and Mission.  People say you should sit right in the middle of the audience, not too far over to the left or right, otherwise the screen will start curling at the edges and you'll lose some of the detail of the grain.  (For the same reason they say not to sit in the first few rows, for the top of the screen will seem too far away and starts \\"whiting out\\" like the Aurora Borealis.)  I don't know if that's so, but why take a chance, so we picked our way through till we found a pair of seats directly under the projector.  It seems to me that all big movies should be released in IMAX simultaneously to their release in regular stock, so kudos to Warner for making this happen with BATMAN BEGINS.  Once the theater went dark you could hear a pin drop, and then, out of the three hundred plus speakers embedded behind the giant screen, you heard the massed orchestra, heavy with brass and glass, launch into the IMAX theme and we were all there.  A whispery little promo under the strings says, \\"Use your IMAXination.\\"<br /><br />Christian Bale, America's number one actor, outdid all of his previous roles (except those in NEWSIES and VELVET GOLDMINE) playing Bruce Wayne as a young man, younger than we're used to seeing him and eliminating the need for a Robin in the story.  Why have Robin when your Batman is just Robin's age?  After all the brouhaha about Katie Holmes' supposed inadequacy in the part of Rachel, I was surprised to see how good she is.  For me, she has always been up and down.  Good sometimes, as in THE GIFT or WONDER BOYS or THE ICE STORM, but I remember seeing that horrible, horrible picture about her being a bohemian in the East Village and trying to make a Thanksgiving dinner for her family, from whom she has been estranged, and nothing, nothing, not even Scientology, could ever be as bad as that horrible movie PIECES OF APRIL and Patricia Clarkson as her mother!  Anyhow her Rachel here was just as good as her Rachel in DISTURBING BEHAVIOR.  I think people just like her playing \\"Rachel,\\" I'm surprised she wasn't Rachel on FRIENDS. In IMAX she soars about thirty-five feet tall and she's a good enough actress to hold her own in scenes opposite many old pros who chew every piece of scenery they find.<br /><br />The people ahead of us in the theater were talking about how the DVD is supposed to have some deleted scenes that Nolan and Co. left out the BB due to excessive length.  (It is pretty long, you definitely get your money's worth.)  I hope they will give us Christian Bale's screen test!  I know many fans who would pay premium money for such a treasure.Anyhow her Rachel here was just as good as her Rachel in DISTURBING BEHAVIOR.

1400034779|5.0|This is not an overly hard-hitting book. Nor is it filled with magnificent prose. What this book is on the other hand is a remarkably unique visionary and elegant reworking of the traditional sleuth mystery.<br /><br />This is a slow book in many regards. The pace set by Alexander McCall Smith is one of quiet reflection. The story bounces back and forth through time and thus fleshes out vividly the character of Precious Ramotswe. Other than a few hard-boiled cases like Matthew Scudder, and one or two Agatha Christie descendents like MC Beaton's Agatha Raisin, I can't think of many other characters that rival Ramostwe in depth. You will be sucked right into a wonderful world and I promise, you will find a side of Africa that you might not have been aware of.<br /><br />The story itself here is a little unusual. When I say that, I mean that it is not linear. It does not follow a plot from start to finish in one grand swoop. Instead what you have here are a series of mysteries undertaken and solved by our protagonist. Also, as I said before, liberal remembrances are interlaced. Note that none of the individual mysteries are really very top shelf. The problems are not those of end of the world or even of deathly peril. Instead you are lead down a bumpy road that I think will offer you more satisfaction than you might believe possible.
B000002UY5|5.0|This is an album you cannot go wrong with.  An extremely underrated band, this album is amazing from start to finish.  One of a mere handful of albums I never get tired of listening to.  Great guitar work and some of the best vocals I have ever heard.
B0006GAOCW|1.0|This is a total Chasing Liberty rip-off. I know they were in production/etc. at the same time, but it's obvious why Mandy's movie was released first. This one should have been a straight to video. I liked Katie in Abandon, but this was just stupid with a very weak plot that has been done so many times before in so many different movies. Katie's character tip-toes around rebellion and always comes running back. This one is more of a \\"family\\" movie, (to be watched by younger children) <br />I was SHOCKED to find out that in this movie, the daughter's boyfriend was also a \\"secret agent\\". Clearly they have no shame in details.. <br />Comparing the two is something that  can't be ignored, and this movie is empty, shallow scripted, and weak. We never see the stronger girl, the wilder girl, anything more than she was. In that we, these movies couldn't be more different. <br /> <br />Now, go buy Chasing Liberty for an exciting movie about a girl on the run to find herself. <br />What are you waiting for?
0060763280|4.0|We have really enjoyed the book.  It opened a lot of areas in our lives that were stuck.  We have given away several copies to others to help them as well.  In addition, we've been able to begin teaching others about why they might not be where they want to be.  We also attended the 3-day Free Seminar and found various parts Objectionable for Christians.  Those parts were too new age and airy fairy.  Yes, we assumed before we went that there would be mini-infomercials for other seminars.  That's capitalism.  Our advise is to read the book, apply everything that you can, but skip the seminar.  The sad thing was that they didn't need any of the new age stuff to make the seminar good.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|Witless, insipid \\"satire\\" is about as subversive as Samuel Huntington.    <br /> <br />A few chuckles here and there, but the political message (and there is indeed a message, make no mistake) is paternalistic, fawning, almost fascistic: the state will \\"protect\\" you from the monsters under your bed, and those who disagree are \\"aiding the enemy\\".   It will accomplish this through the cleansing power of violence, which in turn will rid the world of violence.   Or something.   <br /> <br />Definitely a goofy idea, and definitely worth satirizing; unfortunatley, that's not what they did.  They suggested rather a \\"middle way\\" between limousine liberalism and ultra-nationalism, as though Alec Baldwin represents the extreme left-wing of the political spectrum.   <br /> <br />Only in America.   <br /> <br />Without belaboring the point, the film's thesis shares more than a little in common with philosophy of Kim Jong Il, although the confused lads responsible for this mess were probably unaware of this at the time.   <br /> <br />Should appeal to teenagers and those who get their news from CNN, but people looking for something with teeth/intelligence/daring  would be advised to look elsewhere.     <br /> <br />Does anyone else remember when satirists used to challenge authority instead of embracing it?
B00000295A|4.0|Jamiroquai, as it stood in 1991, was one of the freshest sounds to come out of the Acid Jazz movement. This record, though uneven at times was overshadowed only by it's ambition. 10 tracks, none under 4:50, and  most well over 5 minutes all the while creating a conscious VIBE. That right that was something that the kids were not getting on the radio back in 1991, especially here in America where Hip Hop had finally pierced the brains of record executives as a financial reality. However, for those in search of something just as viable with musicianship to boot, how much did it feel like Christmas Day after just one listen? Yes, in the years since they have had better records, \\"Space Cowboy\\" & \\"Travelling Without Moving\\", also worse ones \\"A Funk Odessey\\", but for what it was worth they have been well worth following just for the music alone. No Jay Kay is no Stevie but who the hell is? If you should choose to listen to this record just listen as a fan of music and in the context of it being 1991 and what was going on musically at that time. Now if you pick up their other CD's you will find that as time passes and the original band starts to splinter that the music also suffers. In particular, when Stuart Zender's bass leaves prior to Synkronized, the band goes to a more Disco influenced direction. This, in my mind, is why Jamiroqual has never had the success stateside that Sony had gambled on back in '90-'91.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|My hat is off to this group for producing a truly fantastic CD. <br />If you like: <br />Enya <br />Loreena McKennitt <br />Or ethereal Celtic new-age music this CD is for you. <br /> <br />Now this isn't real traditional Celtic folk music.  This is more like Celtic opera.  But with those wonderful voices we can forgive the fact that it is a bit over done. <br /> <br />If you are new to Celtic music but enjoy listening to the standards then this might be a good place to start. <br /> <br />Oh and don't forget to catch the TV special on PBS if you can.
B000002L5P|5.0|Released in 1984, the same year as Springsteen's overated though admitingly great Born in the USA album, something across the shores in UK Manchester was being created which by the early 90's would be known on these shores as Indie. <br /> <br />Inspired by punk of the late seventies, and Joy Division (a brilliant band whose carea was sadly cut short following the death by suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis) the band with the unique guitar style of Johnny Marr and the vocal and lyrical witt of lead singer Morrisey produced an album though not their best, would begin a whole new genre of music, just like The Beatles created Pop in the 60'S and Zeppelin Heavy rock/metal in the 70's. <br /> <br />The first Smiths album was based on the diary of Morrisey up to that point of his life. Morrisey a self confessed anti social, selobite (hope I spelt that right) bellows about stress of life, being happy, sad, but most importantly (and the bands unique point) with a blend of grandesque humor. <br /> <br />The album starts with the gorgeous Reel around the fountain, the rumours are that the song was about Mozza's inflirtations with a man he supposedly fancied and the Reel around the fountain supposedly was about...well use your imagination!!!! <br /> <br />You've got everything now speeds up proceedings a song portraying Mozza's need to...well be lazy I guess, Miserable Lie is anything but miserable and contains one of the most hysterical lyrics Mozza ever wrote \\"I recognise that mystical air, indeed I'd like to see your underwear!!!\\" <br /> <br />Pretty girls make girls turns the tables on Mozza's sexuality, whilst Reel was about his gay intentions, Pretty Girls is about his lust for females and how he usually (well basically all the time) ends up dissapointed. <br /> <br />The hand that rock the cradles is a filler track (though a damn strong one) and is about Morrisey's love for a young child, but it is after this song where the album really, and I mean really (if it wasn't already) becomes great!!!! <br /> <br />This Charming Man (released in the UK as a single in 1984, peaking at 25, and re-issued there in 1992, actually the bands biggest hit single it would reach number 8 in the UK) revisits Mozza's gay tendancies, whilst Still ill is a story about Mozza's brief encounter with a girl under an iron bridge. <br /> <br />Hand in Glove (the bands first ever single release, latter to be reissued but this time with Sandie Shaw as lead singer, I think it reached 35 in the charts in the UK or something like that) is perhaps the most confusing lyrically but perhaps one of the most catchiest and easiest songs to remember on the album. <br /> <br />What difference does it make is classic, classic intro brilliant lyrics \\"The devil will find work for idle hands to do\\" represents everything that was great about The Smiths (A very popular radio hit in the UK the song reached number 12 in the UK in 1984). <br /> <br />I don't owe you anything is another brilliantly done love song, with the now usual Mozza brilliance \\"Don't go to them, let them come to you\\" Whilst the album ends on a somber note with Suffer little children, a song dedicated to the death of school children during the Manchester Morse murders. <br /> <br />Overall The Smiths premier albums is a classic album by the most influencial and important band of the eighties!!!
6305537321|5.0|So says Hollygolightly (Audrey Hepburn) as she gets to know her new upstairs neighbor, writer Paul Varjak (George Peppard) just a little better.  While this is not my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie, it's my favorite romantic comedy of them all about a wacky callgirl, a cat named Cat (\\"poor slob without a name\\") and a handsome young writer who must acquire his own independence as a kept man before helping the stylish, seemingly carefree young woman he's falling in love with.<br /><br />I hate to give so much of this wonderful story away as it's got to be seen to be loved, and the movie does itself more justice than I ever could.  Truman Capote was always upset that Audrey Hepburn was cast as Holly Golightly than his first pick, Marilyn Monroe, but when you watch this movie, you will see just how much classier and appealing Hepburn was in the role than Monroe would have been, althought I can see elements of Monroe in the character.  There is definite chemistry between Hepburn and Peppard, and Henry Mancini's musical score is absolutely beautiful throughout.  Great fashion and shots of New York abound throughout, and the stars are flanked by an excellent supporting cast in Patricia Neal, Villalonga, John MacGiver, and Mickey Rooney as a slightly offensive and stereotypical but still funny Mr. Yunioshi (Times were different back then.).  A magical,  humorous, and often touching love story, if you haven't seen it yet, please do.  This movie came out in 1961, and it is still the idyllic romantic comedy to end them all.  Few have measured up since, but I welcome them to try.
B0009P42S2|1.0|...what was the director (Katsuhiro tomo)thinking? I heard that this movie, in terms of animation, took TEN YEARS to complete. All I can say on that is, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.  <br />I don't know about the DVD version, as I watched this in the theatre, but one thing's for sure; I will NOT rent/buy this DVD; the movie hits an all-time low from the very beginning. Why couldn't they dub this film in English????? It's not very realistic, seeing a bunch of ENGLISH people in ENGLAND speaking JAPANESE!!! The plot seems to wander aimlessly round and round so much my head spins just thinking about it...until we meet our alleged heroine, Scarlett O'Hara (what are they trying to point out here? Or was her naming just an uncanny coincidence?)who shamelessly displays animal cruelty on her poor, helpless little chihuahua. Needless to say, I loathed her from the very beginning. Being a rich, spoilt brat, she did not warm my heart, failing to play the part of a \\"heroine\\". Plus, the relationship between Ray Steam (like the pun?) and Scarlett did not build: there was one point where they seemed to be a bit 'different' so to speak, and that, apart from wowing at the graphics, was probably the best part of the movie. Other that that, I came out of the theatre very irritated and almost deaf: the volume was insanely high...I couldn't even catch up on some sleep! Plus the movie didn't even have any worthy morals; they seemed to promote greed and lust for power. <br /> <br />To cut a long story short: Don't buy this movie unless you like pretty graphics (though not at all corresponding with the setting). Save your money, time and sanity!
B000001Y5D|1.0|Like many people have repeatedly said, Bigger Faster is not a good album. 4 Non-Blondes are the epitome of a one-hit wonder band. Anyone thinking about purchasing this album needs to seriously rethink what they want to do, because the only song they'll want is \\"What's Up\\". Even that one song on repeat listens is going to get old after more than one listen. And then it starts to latch onto your brain stem and slowly kill any function your brain was capable of. It's really a dreadful song in retrospect. Linda Perry (doesn't she look like a post-op Perry Farrell?) undulates like a dying cat when she wails \\"Hey yay yay Yay yay yay Yaerggggghhhhh-- What's going on\\". It's simply grotesque. I remember that several bands in the early 90's tried their hand at this quasi Folk/Grunge conglomeration, and results were disastrous. Another one of these acts in question was Blind Melon. Sure, everyone (myself included) loved \\"No Rain\\", but if you bought the full-length album, you'd wished you hadn't
B00006AW2J|5.0|Even though the Stones' foray into psychadelia was nowhere close to bad, it's sad to think that they wasted that time when they were obviously meant to create roots based raunchy Rock n' Roll, as is seen executed masterfully on Beggar's Banquet. <br /> <br />From the get go they proved they could spit out classic rock with the beat heavy \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" a song that has Jaggers posing as the devil, telling his story of the ages. Though it's not as controversial nowadays, back then it was a bold move. But it made for one of their best and most well known songs. And that's saying a lot considering the Stones' long successful career. <br /> <br />However, \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" just jumpstarts this wonderful album. The slow bluesy number \\"No Expectations\\" that follows it is just as impactful. The slide guitar coupled with Mick Jaggers tortured whine denotes a feeling of true sorrow. The lyrics are simple, but honest in their presentation. It's one of the many great overlooked Stones songs. But hey...when you have this many hits, it's hard not to overlook a few right? <br /> <br />\\"Dear Doctor\\", \\"Prodigal Son\\", and \\"Factory Girl\\" are all country blues workouts, and the good news is they're all great. Through sloppy overdubbing and old timey styled slide guitar, they managed to catch the sound and feel of american roots music perfectly, even if it sound parodic at times. <br /> <br />\\"Street Fighting Man\\" is a great acoustic romp that sticks to the same melody (like many Stones songs) from beginning to end, adding textures or solos along the way. Despite it's sound, it's done with all acoustic instruments, making it deceptively energetic as Jaggers screams out his cryptic message with loose abandon. <br /> <br />\\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is a monumentally good blues workout and a true triumph on Beggar's Banquet and for the Stones in general. It's the Stones playing loud, raunchy blues at the top of their game. It also marked a step toward some truly sexually explicitlyrics that they would take further and further throughout their career. Here, however, it's still interesting and not completely over the top. <br /> <br />\\"Parachute Woman\\" and \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" are the only two I really consider filler due to their lack of intensity. That's not to say they're not good, however. On the contrary. They're great. They just don't set off a specific emotion like their country blues and full out rock numbers do. <br /> <br />\\"Salt of the Earth\\" is also a very good track, and a great song to end the album on. Keith Richards' vocals in this song are not particularly professional, but that's the whole point. He sounds like an untrained working man doing his best to sing in tune. The album ends as triumphantly as it started, as the Stones \\"drink to the hard working people.\\" <br /> <br />Well here's to you guys! Thanks for sticking to your guns and making one of the most memorable albums in rock history. <br /> <br />Pick this album up.
0375507256|5.0|A tour de force of literature, Cloud Atlas takes the reader from 1830 to the extreme far future with a series of connected stories that deal with time, history, and how one person's life can be another's work of art (or legend).  Mitchell is masterful at using completely different styles in each of his story, and his protagonists are vital human beings burning with life.  This is a novel no one should miss.  Breathtaking!
0312335164|4.0|I am a fussy reader. I will not settle for just anything. I will put a substandard book down in a heartbeat, no matter who the author is! I recently finished Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress.\\" The chronicle was appealing from start to finish. I listened to the audio version of the book during the tiring commute to and from work each day. I enjoyed the technical aspect of the book, as well as the underlying adventure. While not simple by any means, the story proved to be just deep enough, all the while moving with moderate speed - no heavy wording or bogged down descriptions here. If bogginess is what you want, read King or Koontz. Dan Brown has a story to tell, and he tells it well. Readers need to learn not to over analyze fictional plots; it ruins the fun of the story! Save your claims of inaccuracy for the non-fiction! Readers should recognize that this novel is a fun fictional story with non-fictional aspects working as a backdrop. I recommend reading Digital Fortress, followed by Angels & Demons, with Deception Point and The Da Vinci Code to wrap it up. Nice job Mr. Brown!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I don't know if it can be topped (although, the new Mt. Eerie samples I heard make me think there is a contender). This album is bloody brilliant. This is better than last year's Seven Swans, and is even better than the amazing Say Yes to M!ch!gan! If my hunch is correct, Illinoise will expose Sufjan to the greater public - and rightly so. The beautiful compositions on these songs coupled with the sprawling stories told are absolutely enthralling. Sufjan covers material from John Wayne Gacy, to the Night of the Living Dead, to the Great Godfrey Maze. The emotianal range is just as impressive. I can honestly say that I have laughed out loud AND become teary in the duration of four or five songs. Rediculous, but true.  <br /> <br />Ok, to avoid the gush that was my review of Sung Tongs last year, I will suffice to say that you are crazy to not pick up this album. I payed 16 bucks at Barnes and Nobel, which would be a bit pricey for most other albums. Sufjan aint stingy though - he provides 22 memorable tracks, no filler material.  <br />
B00097DX3U|1.0|The second album from grunge-era supergroup Audioslave plays out more like a boring `90s alt-rock mixtape than anything else. It's sad that a talented band like Rage Against the Machine has to play second fiddle to Chris Cornell's ridiculous growls and Jesus Christ posing. Honestly, it sounds like Tom Morello isn't even trying anymore as he strums his guitar, rewrites his past riffs and dicks around on his diverse collection of effects pedals. These guys have just done it so many times over again, it's now become unwelcome nostalgia. They prove this with the album's first radio-ready single, \\"Be Yourself.\\" C'mon, it sounds like Cornell is taking songwriting lessons from Raffi as he sings \\"be yourself is all that you can do.\\" Sorry, it's not going to work this time around. <br /> <br />- Nick Walker <br />Synthesis.net
B00003CX9W|3.0|I deplore the fact that this is a censored, cut version of the original movie, which I saw as a child and again when it was re-released in movie theaters in Italy in 1969, uncut. I think it is phony to pretend the black centauress never existed, or was never part of the movie. She cannot be wished away or airbrushed out. The depiction was not excessively mean, though it was mildly demeaning.  <br /> <br />Frankly, it is much worse, how close Disney comes to kitsch in much of the film. I cannot listen to Ponchielli's \\"Dance of the Hours\\" without seeing flying hippos and absurd alligators. Disney systematically ridiculed this piece from top to bottom. Except for the truly glorious ending, with Apollo in his chariot and Night overspreading the world in a beautiful purple cloak, the whole Pastorale Symphony is pure 1940s kitsch. All that is lacking is pillbox hats. <br /> <br />The Tschaikovsky, Bach and Mussorgsky segments are dazzling, though. Nutcracker is kitsch to begin with, so Disney fits right in. The Sorcerer's Apprentice began as a comic piece by the 2nd century AD Greek writer, Lucian of Samosata, so it is no great injustice to use Mickey Mouse to illustrate Dukas' version of it.  <br /> <br />Night on Bald Mountain is one of the most powerful pieces of animation and imagery ever put on film. When Disney wanted to do it, he could come up with utterly unforgettable images. How far the Disney studios have fallen! What saccharine pap they put out nowadays! How distant this jagged, powerful, magnificent piece of work seems now! Disney's huge bat-winged demon could have eaten the Little Mermaid and Pocahontas for breakfast!

0195067142|5.0|With the Old Breed started out as a chance for a grandfather to share with his children and grandchildren the experiences that he had during World War II in the Pacific theater. It ended up being one of the most gruesome, but also most realistic, documents on the war ever written. The detail captured in With the Old Breed by Eugene B. Sledge, is unmatched by any other author, and he should be commended on such a truthful accounting of his fighting as a United States Marine.<br /><br />He starts With the Old Breed at basic training where he enlists and then flunks out of officer school to get to the front lines quicker. In hindsight, one might think it was a bad decision, but the way officers where being picked off in the Pacific by Japanese gunmen, it might have been the better decision. Located in San Diego, his training allowed him to be taught by some of the best instructors in the United States, getting him ready for what lay ahead.<br /><br />His first stay in the Pacific was at Pavuvu, where he received more training specific to the Japanese, and was finally sent to Peleliu. Thinking it was going to be a fast battle like that of Tarawa, Sledge was quickly introduced to the horrors of island fighting that would characterize the War in the Pacific from then on. A month later, Sledge was a battle hardened veteran, surviving the front lines, reserves, etc. without an injury.<br /><br />It was then back to Pavuvu for some more training, work detail, and the much needed break from the front line. His next stop would be Okinawa, still considered the largest amphibious assault of World War II and the largest land, air, and sea battle in history. Sledge was one of the many troops circling the waters in an amtrac prior to the assault, and spent 3 months on the island fighting, delivering ammunition, and on work detail through the horrid rain and stench of dead bodies.<br /><br />Finally, with the dropping of the atomic bombs and the surrender of the Japanese on August 15, 1945, Sledge's journey through the horrors of the Pacific had finally come to an end.<br /><br />Sledge's account of the war is unlike anything I have ever read. He makes light of the stupidity, horror, stench, atrocities, jokes, hatred, and everything else in between. But he writes in a manner that is simple and easy to understand, without flowery language to smooth out the rough edges of war. And even though he experiences many atrocities at the hands of the Japanese and many stupidities at the hands of his US officers, Sledge still writes with an open mind, never pinning problems on one person or lumping together a group of people through his experiences only. He writes specifically stating throughout With the Old Breed that these are his experiences only and that they might not reign true for the rest of the soldiers. I respect that aspect of his document more than any other. Not really a problem but something to note when you begin reading this document: it was hard keeping track of where Sledge was positioned while on each island, but the maps of each area helped tremendously as references. I do have to warn readers that the book can get gruesome at points, but such is war and the truthful accounting of it.<br /><br />Some of the stories I enjoyed reading about include the basic training lesson about guns, the Marine who tried to crap at night, and the guy stuck between a rock and a hard place with his wife and Betty. I was horrified by the stories of the scavengers, especially the one trying to get a gold tooth with his kabar, the soldier who assisted a Japanese woman with her pain, the time when Sledge nearly had to dig a hole in a spot with a few too many maggots, and the slide down a wet and muddy hill that left many Marines vomiting.<br /><br />As I write this review, I can still feel the stress, smell the stench and imagine the utter horror of being on the front lines while the Japanese are bunkered up in the mountains and hills. Yet my imagination cannot even fathom half of what the Marines and other military personnel went through in the Pacific. I can only read about it. So I would like to thank those who went through this experience for me and the rest of the United States, because who knows what our future would have been like without you.<br /><br />To anyone considering reading this document (I call it that because of its validity to the War in the Pacific), do not hesitate to buy it and find it as part of your top shelf of books to read again. Everyone enjoy!y imagination cannot even fathom half of what the Marines and other military personnel went through in the Pacific. I can only read about it.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Excellent story of a son discovering his father: the man he never knew.  Tall tales abound and, in the end, half or more of the tales, which seem made up, suddenly appear true. <br /> <br />Gives you good shivers when you see it.
B0008GNJZY|4.0|Samuel L. Jackson did a wonderful job in this film, however, to me it was a \\"remake\\" of Hoosiers.  I would recommend to rent and view, but for purchase, I was disappointed.

0380715430|3.0|I'm not a language or history expert, but I love words, vocabulary and language. This book was fun for me to read just for the funny translations of English. I giggled out loud several times at some of the wordplay. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book.
6305546789|4.0|Halloween is regarded as the slasher flick that started them all still to this day. (There is already a \\"Halloween 9\\" in the making).Being a large fan of horror movies, I have to applaud this film for really getting things going for the genre. Halloween itself though is not the greatest movie. In modern day times, it has lost a great deal of its effectiveness, simply because of age. Not to mention it grew more and more disgraced with each sequel over the years. And the movie itself is quite slow moving and dull. I realize in the seventies, seeing a girl in her bra and panties was probably thought of as quite exciting, and someone in a mask was most likely considered insane. But looking at Halloween in the long run, it is simply a classic, nothing that should really be considered scary. Other movies of the same age, like Texas chainsaw massacre, have been able to retain a lot of their luster even after all these years, and although it had sequels, it never truly turned into a franchise.
038533348X|4.0|I've just finished Cat's Cradle and I have walked away with a sense of low self-esteem.  I, however, will not allow this feeling to pain me that much.  Intuitively, I know this is a natural reaction many have had after reading Vonnegut for the first time. You see, after you have had your first experience with the man you gain an important insight.  The insight is simply this:  Vonnegut is more intelligent than you are and he revels in it; this, I am convinced, is what makes his writing outstanding.  The reasons for this correlation are easy to find for they lie, laughing up at you, strewn across the pages of this book.  On the surface, Cat's Cradle is a chronicle of the last days of humankind.  Its nameless protagonist, a writer, relates the tale of how he set the events that eventually led to our demise in motion.  His recounting makes our departure from this planet seem like an event in the best interests of everyone involved with the planet Earth.  For support, Cat's Cradle happens to rail against every absurdity present in modern day, western civilization.  All the things that make us suck as a collective are satirized brilliantly here folks: blindly ignorant nationalism, blindly conformist religion, and of course, politics.  In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut has authored a book that has its finger on the pulse of the western human condition and I relate to and like it immensely.  For the first time, exemplified in this little novel, I can see all of the attributes that have made Vonnegut a champion to high school and college students for over forty years.  I am no longer a college student but I am more of a cynic now than ever before.  For those of us who can not turn a deaf ear to the discord around us, Vonnegut's writing will always be there, saying \\"It's okay.  I understand\\".
B0002YLC24|5.0|As an Austinite, I can't say that this film sprung up on me, but I nonetheless left the theatre emotionally cleansed and refreshed.  This near perfect little film flows easily and among many other things truly shows people, especially Americans, once again why Paris is the most romantic city in the world.  I was completely emotionally invested in the characters, not just the leads but everyone else (such as Julie Delpy's dad) too.    The high praise I wish to lavish on this film isn't enough; the words that come into my mind when I think of it are these:  lovely, simply lovely, lush, romantic, sensual, emotional, engaging, flowing, real, truthful, slice-of-life, etc. etc.    This movie is like a wonderful hug from that old friend you haven't seen in years but you often think about.  That's how good this movie is.
B000002BFL|5.0|Nebraska is my favorite Springsteen album.  This is my second. I never like his band, and as for their overproduction - don't get me started! This is what Nebraska would have been if he'd wanted to record a quiet album but actually gone into the studio to do it. It's full of haunting images of what America once was, what it could be and what it really is if you only had the eyes to see. It's full of characters, the Border Patrolman who falls blindly in love (blind - get it?), the Vietnamese refugee whose life is spared by the last-minute compassion of his working-class neighbor (Commie sympathiser, indeed!). Youngstown, which got a little radio play, actually has a little hook to it, but also some great lyrics: \\"When I die don't send me to Heaven/I would not do Heaven's work well/Just send me...to the fiery furnaces of Hell.\\" The title song is a beautifully understated psalm to the hobo's universe, with Bruce outdoing Henry Fonda on the coda to Steinbeck's opus.   <br /> <br />Unless \\"Pink Cadillac\\" is your favorite Springsteen song, you owe it to yourself to get this one.
0790729652|5.0|Like many folks, I am revisiting the old \\"Batman\\" series after viewing \\"Batman Begins\\". \\"Batman\\" is definitely one of Tim Burton's best films and a great take on the DC Comics \\"Batman\\" series.<br /><br />Michael Keaton in many ways is much more believable as taciturn and brooding Bruce Wayne than Batman.  Jack Nicholson (The Joker) more often than not steals the show as well as wreaking no end of havoc on Gotham City.  He's got the best lines and Nicholson is very hard to play against---good man or bad.<br /><br />The effects are still good and the action still keeps you glued to your seat, but the soundtrack doesn't fare so well.  Prince may have had many of us rocking in the 80s, but he's just not as worthy of the title classic as other artists.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|As a long time QOTSA fan, I was eagerly awaiting this album like a kid on Christmas Eve.  So it's been a while since i've bought it, and several hundred listens and one killer live show later, I think i'm ready to review it.   <br /> <br />The new Queens lineup doesn't really look like the lineup from the past two albums.  No Nick Oliveri thumping on the bass and wailing, and no Mark Lanegan (with the exception of the opener) adding his gruff and whiskey stained voice to a few choice songs.  So as a result, Josh has overhauled the sound of the band somewhat, to moderate success.   <br /> <br />For the most part, this album works.  Medication is an intense song that really kicks the album in to high gear.  Burn the Witch, which features Billy Gibbons on guitar is a fantastic song, and Someone's in the Wolf is an wonderful song in the vein of other cryptic QOTSA epics like Mosquito Song and I Think I Lost My Headache.   <br /> <br />The lyrics of this album veer towards the more masogynistic, with songs about relationships like In My Head and Broken Box.  These are your typical broken love songs that QOTSA has been putting out since day one.   <br /> <br />All these songs are good, but they just don't click to the next level like Songs for the Deaf or Rated R.  Josh has proven he can make a quality rock record on his own terms, and it is definitely more polished that the previous QOTSA albums, but it's just not great.  It's good, but not great.   <br /> <br />So for fans of the band, this is a must have.  The songs are high quality and the album works as a whole.  For newbies, check out Rated R or Songs for the Deaf first.
B00005JNJV|5.0|As a kid, I was hooked on the original Batman television series with Adam West.  I couldn't wait to come home from school to see who the Dynamic Duo would be up against that day.  Have enjoyed the \\"Dark Knight\\" cartoons and all the movies--particularly the third in the series \\"Batman Forever\\" with Val Kilmer as Bruce/Batman.     Needless to say, I saw \\"Batman Begins\\" on the first night.  I've been back once---driving 2 hours to reach the San Antonio IMAX to see \\"Batman Begins\\" on the big screen.     \\"Batman Begins\\" is a prequel to all the other motion pictures, filling in Bruce Wayne's backstory from what we've only before seen as nightmares and flashbacks.  Here we see Bruce's parents die and know the youth's full pain.  We also see Bruce retiring from the priviledged world to understand crime so he can fight it better.  He's selected by a mysterious man Ras Al Ghul, who tells him he's being recruited to bring justice to the world.  Aftet grueling training, Wayne realizes that Al Ghul and Company are planning to destroy his home, Gotham City.  Bruce returns to his hometown and becomes Batman to help rein in on the crime spree that threatens to turn the town into a modern-day Babylon.      Christian Bale is my favorite actor portraying Batman.  His very down-to-earth humor fits what I think of Bruce Wayne. Michael Caine also blew me away as Alfred Pennyworth.  At last, an actor truly worthy of the role. What I really like is very little of the movie is 'dated.' The Prince soundtrack from \\"Batman\\" definitely takes you back to the 1980's and just doesn't hold up to today.  I think \\"Batman Begins\\" is a very nice beginning indeed.  I hope they will continue and redo the old Batman stories.
B0006L16N8|5.0|i'm sure there are many other reviews that sound extremely similar to this one but i might go down the usual path here of praising all 4 members of coldplay for an album that moved me to tears first time i heard it. there are moving, emotional ballads similar to the scientist like fix u, what if etc also the extra track til kingdom come is equally beautiful. coldplay (or mainly chris martin) have been known to compare themselves with the beatles and their aspirations to be as good as them are clear in this album. eg a guitar riff similar to 'she's so heavy'in twisted logic. my fav tracks : low, twisted logic, x and y <br />but it's a difficult choice.  <br />if u like parachutes adn rush of blood, u should not hesitate in buying x and y.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|Dave Grohl has had quite the career in music. Drums for nirvana, the debut foo fighters, on which he played and sang every note of music, the creation and maturing of the band, and perhaps one of the best and most underrated singer/songwriters around right now. He's the kind of person who'd be getting the \\"life time achievment award\\" if he created all these landmark moments for movies instead of music. All of these things show more than ever on the foo fighters fifth album, an ambitious two CD project. One CD is chalk full of the rockers that got the foo fighter famous in the first place, the second, a batch of acoustic and quiet tracks, in the tradition of the acoustic versions of songs like \\"Times like these\\" and \\"Everlong\\".     I am happy to announce that both CD's triumph. You'll hear Grohl scream full blast, louder than ever on the disc 1 opener \\"In Your Honor\\" and then hear him croon like never before on the disc 2 opener \\"Still\\". The difference is truly entrancing, because the foo fighters can pull off hard rockers, and acoustic ballads like almost no one else in the music industry. Most bands lean one way or another, while on this release Grohl and company lean both ways, and prove very good in both. Rockers like \\"No way back\\" and \\"Best of you\\" are classic foo material, and will bring back memories for fans of the earlier days of the bands career, while \\"Hell\\", \\"in your honor\\", and \\"The last song\\" deliver bone crushing hard rock, harder than anything the band has ever put out. It is however in this respect that \\"In Your Honor\\" shows its only flaws. Neither disc is strong enough to be its own album. The first disc is too hard, too loud, and exhausting, and the second disc is too soft at periods, and sometimes too boring. Both sides can't survive without the other. Throughout the first disc you'll be longing for the softer ballads, throughout the seconds, you'll long for faster, much harder music. I would have liked it better if they had been mixed up, split five hard and five soft on each disc, but its a small gripe seeing as there is so much good music here to enjoy.    \\"Best of You\\", \\"No way back\\", and \\"End over end\\" especially deliver addicting rockers that yearn for re-listens over and over again, while many songs on the second disc do the same. \\"Best of you\\" is one of my favorite songs so far this decade.     The second disc is really interesting to hear. Grohl shows how good a vocalist he can be, giving songs like \\"Miracle\\" a great feel. \\"On the mend\\" is brilliant, as is \\"Razor\\" and almost anything else on the disc. \\"Virginia Moon\\" is an interesting duet with Norah Jones, but its a little too slow, and seems to last much longer than needed. Its worth a few listens, but won't be a favorite.     By the time \\"End Over End\\" and \\"Razor\\" close out their respective discs, all complaints about Grohl and the band have been silenced, because they manage to pull off everything they try to do here. Both discs are excellent, and at the end of the day, despite my complaints, these are 20 of the best, most satisfying songs you'll find this year, and even if their presentation could have been better, this still ends up being the band's best album to date, and one of the best of 2005 so far.      (NOTE) I had no trouble uploading this onto iTunes.I just did what I do with every other CD, and I have had no problem with it in any CD players,but then again nothing ever opened when I inserted it into my computer...whats happened for everyone else?
0316172324|4.0|\\"Writing about Music is like dancing about architecture.\\"Laurie Anderson<br /><br />Instead of a phd thesis beating one dead horse after another, this is a book for those who 'get it' and get it right away. Whipping from one disparate topic to the next and then sinching them together beautifully doesn't make it a rip-off; it makes it readable, Not in a summer novel way. Readable like poetry that you want to take in again with a second read. For those who want a linear progression with detailed explanations, you won't like it. For those of you who find yourselves urging on your longwinded friends because you know what point they're getting at before they know it themselves, you'll love it. And those different thinkers are indeed, the very thesis of the book.<br /><br /> The style is no accident; the style is the point itself. Lovely, really. I read it in a sitting.
B00008F25Y|3.0|Dune, the desert world of Arrakis.  In short, the Dune saga was set in a distant future, when Man has extended his reach over countless worlds, and has plumbed the very limits of his own consciousness.  But man has not evolved past his own greed and lust for power.  The desert world of Dune would be a speck in the great imperia of Man were it not the only source of the Spice Melange, an otherworldy substance crucial to every aspect of man's interstellar reach.  In an age bereft of computers (they were outlawed in the aftermath of a now ancient religious crusade against thinking machines) only the sappho extract of Melange allows human beings called Mentats to think with mechanical precision.  Only \\"Spacing Guild Navigators\\" - human beings evolved over centuries of forced-addiction to the spice - can helm huge starships across vast tracts of space separating the human-colonized worlds of the universe.  Only the \\"Bene Gesserit\\" - a secretive society of women using Melange to enlarge their conciousness, the \\"Illuminati\\" of this age - can direct the warring aristocracy past each other's Byzantine plotting.  In a prosperous and chaotic universe, the spice is the beginning, the end, everything. <br /> <br />\\"Dune\\" couldn't be anything more than a major disappointment when it was first screened in '84.  The stakes were just too high.  Still, nobody was prepared for just how big a doff it could be.  Special effects are spotty, and the script is frustrated in trying to sketch a distant and complex era lacking Herbert's freedom to do as much in his novel.  Following the first book, \\"Dune\\" tells of the manipulated destinies of the Atreides and the Harkonnen - perpetually warring members of this futuristic aristocracy.  With Atreides growing too strong for his liking, the Emperor colludes with the Harkonnen to destroy them from within.  Unknown to him, the BG have plans of their own, to breed a super being who will rule the universe, and be ruled by them (eugenics being a BG preoccupation).  Unknown to them, Paul, heir to the Atreides dukedom, may be that super being - the \\"Kwisatz Haderach\\".  Unknown to Paul, the Spacing Guild seems already to suspect Paul's destiny - one that directly threatens their power.  Unknown to all of them is the role of the Fremen - the fiercely religious and independent inhabitants of Dune.  Manipulated by BG using religion, the Fremen have exceeded the furor hoped for by the Fremen, and ready themselves to launch a Jihad against those who would seek to rule their world.  On the burnt sands of Dune, where giant sandworms grasp the real power, and water is more precious than jewels, Atreides, Harkonnen, the Emperor and the Bene Gesserit collide to determine the fate of the universe. <br /> <br />So what went wrong?  A lot actually went right.  The disturbing eye of David Lynch proves scarily effective in capturing two critical aspects of the series - how its warring characters have become imprisoned by their own incessant and mortal plotting; and the pain the main characters endure as they expand their consciousnesses using the spice. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, what doesn't work overwhelms what does.  \\"Dune\\" is basically a biblical epic - set in a distant future rather than a distant past - but otherwise having the same types of characters, and the same widescale of storytelling in which individual characters get lost.  The special effects are nothing special (at least one shot looks more like a conceptual art piece for what the final shot was meant to look like), and the use of voice-overs seems to highlight an uneasy sense of narrative.  Characters just come and go, or exist just to appear instead of having anything to do with the story.  (Lynch perennial Jack Nance - Eraserhead, and the Man Who Found Laura Palmer Wrapped in Plastic, as Nefud, plays music as the Baron gloats.)  Still better than the more literal version aired on The Sci-Fi Channel, this version hints at the twin properties of both the Dune novels and the Melange itself - addictive and mind-blowing.
B00000K3UU|5.0|Big Daddy is a movie in which Adam Sandler stars as a toll booth guy ( Sonny Koufax ) trying to raise a kid on his own to impress his \\" girlfriend \\" Vanessa (Kristy Swanson). <br /> <br />Big Daddy is my favorite Sandler movie, and one of my favorite ever movies, simply because of its humor and simple enough story. Some people think that some intended humor in this movie was pointless and stupid, but I highly dissagree. There are jokes throughout this entire movie, even sometimes during \\"emotional\\" times. if you haven't seen this movie by now, I feel bad for you, because this movie even has Rob Schneider (Nazo), Sonny's \\"best friend\\", who is a delivery guy, and is funny throughout the movie. Steve Buscemi is also in this movie, playing the Homeless guy, who also adds some humor into the already funny movie. <br /> <br />Why do some people say \\"this is a movie that creates bad examples for kids\\"? Well, yeah it might, but they also must forget the fact this is rated PG-13, so kids if they don't wanna shouldn't watch it then. <br /> <br />Anyways, obviously buy this movie. If you don't; \\" I'll give you a crew cut mister. \\"

0812550706|3.0|I did not enjoy this book. I'm not just writing this to cause trouble--I hate it when people do that. This book took me FOREVER to read, and I'm usually a really fast reader.  <br /> <br />Ender's Game was reccommended to me by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I was excited because my friend and I usually love the same books; however, this one was different! <br /> <br />Sure, the plot was interesting, but it just repeated itself, over and over and over again. I thought the book was extremely slow and not too exciting. I am not one who gives up on books, and I had faith in this one, but I think that the only reason I ended up finishing the book was because I kept waiting for it to get better--which it did not. <br /> <br />I've read worse books though, that's why I'm giving it 3 stars...
0385720920|4.0|Chuck Palaniuk is a light in a literary word littered with pansy love stories and chick flick screen plays.  Palahniuk's story of anti-hero Victor Mancini is dark, twisted & hysterically funny.  That being said, not everyone will like this book.  Palahniuk is raw and at times obscene.  Choke is incredibly so.  I imagine a lot of people will be offended by some of the language in this book.  If you don't look through the words and into the minds of the characters, all you'll read is obscenities.  For example, some of Victor's sexual exploits are described in graphic detail.  However, I felt as though Palahniuk did an amazing job of removing all sexual excitement from the scenes and making them the emotionless exploits of a helpless addict.  I'd love to go further with this, but it may ruin some of the scenes for those who haven't read it yet.  If you're intrigued by dark, twisted humor with a touch of cultural commentary mixed in, (and if you're not offended by words alone) you'll love this book.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork's Post which has everything that a classic album should have in its elements with production, lyrics and overall performance.  Right from the start with \\"Army Of Me\\" the endless head nod begins with this almost rock/metal loud beat with a continuous synthesizer as does \\"Enjoy\\".  Deep bass and crystal clear highs on \\"Hyper-ballad\\" and \\"Possibly Maybe\\" could almost be used in a hip-hop/rap tune.  As Bjork does sometimes speak in her Iceland language it is sometimes hard to understand, but the tecno style sound of \\"The Modern Things\\", \\"Enjoy\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" prepares you for a night of moving.  One of the heights of Post, \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\", is a Broadway/Cotton Club/jazzy song that immediately send you in an awe!  Damn can anyone touch the girl?  No, Bjork is in a state of being an individual!
B0001XAPX8|1.0|With all the great actors in this film who are absolutely the top, I expected the film to be excellent. To me, it is a film that does not know where it is going. It heads off in too many directions. I was thoroughly disappointed. Maybe I should have read the book first, but Mr. Roth is not a favorite author, he writes as if dialog for textbooks, and soon becomes boring and hard to concentrate on the story.
B000056K04|2.0|I am a huge DMB fan, and own every album they have.  This is by far the worst album they made.  In fact, it probably should have never been released. Some of the songs on the album make great live songs such as what you are and when the world ends but other than that the quality of the album is just not any good.  The sound is not classic Dave, which the sound all dave fans know and love. This album is even worse than his brand new release Stand Up.
B0009HLDFU|2.0|I just purchased \\"in Your Honor\\" by the Foo Fighters, and went home and put it in my CD player immediately. I was very impressed, both CDs are an excellent addition to anyones music library. However, when I went to put the CD on my iPod, I found out it wouldn't work. New anti-piracy protection by use of protected .wma files won't work in iTunes or iPods. Upon very close inspection of the packaging, I discovered miniscule print that none of my family members could read, myself included. Evidently, the unreadable print says the CD will only work with portable devices that support protected .wma files. An e-mail to the tech support for the CD, and their response was to rip the protected .wma files to the computer, then burn them to a CD, then copy the songs from the burned CD, which lacks the copyright protection. After going through this long process, I was once again disappointed as the quality of the sound had greatly deteriorated.  I know that I am not the only iPod owner in the world. I am sure there are many other iPod owners who share my disappointment, and hope that Sony BMG / RCA can come up with a much easier solution that won't lose sound quality, or at least but a big sticker on the front that reads \\"Will Not Work With iPods\\", so that people won't be disappointed with their waste of $18.
0671688782|4.0|After adopting our 2 year-old, I researched ways to bond with him and also ways to better communicate with our 3 year-old bio daughter -- I found Holding Time.  After reading and implementing it for six months with both of our children, I read all 59 reader reviews listed -- I was discouraged, but not surprised by what I read.  Many, like me, had wonderful experiences, but others were certain this was either a cult or an act of violent abuse.  We (both myself and my husband) feel our use of this technique has changed our relationships with our children -- they are both more bonded, more communicative, more confident in our relationships.  However, my concern for others is that there is seemingly a lack of a common sense approach to the technique -- it should be obvious to ALL parents that one does not put their body weight onto a small child, does not use FORCE to control a child's feelings, etc.  The technique described in the book -- stradle the parent's lap with child and hold the child's arms, then COMMUNICATE -- requires the ability to communicate EFFECTIVELY, age-appropriately to one's child.  This technique DOES work, though the author's claims of a cure-all are, in my opinion, a bit strong.  My advice to parents reading Holding Time -- if you find it isn't working, there is probably an error in your execution, so seek professional advice!
0060589280|5.0|The best thing I can say about reading this book is that when it was done, I wanted to read more.<br /><br />It's not \\"Moby Dick.\\" It's not \\"100 Years of Solitude.\\" You will not feel you're reading a dictionary (or a thesaurus, for that matter). Quite frankly, I believe there's a time and place for all well-written books. And this is definitely one of those, with an appeal to a wide range of audiences.<br /><br />Mr. Coelho's candid simplicity allowed me to open my eyes in my own life, and not many books have done that for me. I would highly recommend it for anyone who can be open-minded about sex and love (the book has some sexually charged moments and it's certainly not puritanical). Interesting stuff. After the opening line, and knowing Mr. Coelho's previous writing, I wasn't sure about this one -- but within pages, he had drawn me in. Again.<br /><br />The book made me consider how open I am to new experiences. Whether I have the faith in myself to leap, to trust that I'll come out okay on the other side. Whether I'm afraid to take risks. Whether I'm consciously blocking parts of my life out of fear. And no, I'm not talking about sex -- the decisions Maria makes (or doesn't) somehow became an interesting parallel to other parts of my life. It's definitely something I'll keep on my bookshelf and open again for another read in the future. In fact, I've suggested it to my boyfriend already.
B00005K3OT|2.0|This movie had a lot of potential.  It has a fine cast, wonderful setting, and the beginnings of an intersting story.  However, I can't recommend this movie.  I actually found it irritating.  Here's why:    This movie has an agenda; a message it is trying to promote.  The message is a basic humanist take on life; be tolerant and accepting of other people, sit around and chat over a cup of hot chocolate and leave the larger concerns alone... if you do this you'll be a good person.      That message is not bad.  In fact, it's the underlying theme of a lot of literature.  The problem is that in Chocolat, it's so heavily pushed that it feels like watching a propaganda piece.  Over and over, the film tells you what to think and how to react.  It is as if the film were the very embodiment of its own antagonist, Reynaud... 'There is a right way to think and a wrong way to think.  See how we are showing you the right way?  This is the right way.  The other way is wrong.  Do you see how the other way is wrong?'    In order to promote its agenda the film tears down other points of view.  Indulgence is better than discipline.  Drifters are kinder and more intelligent than parishioners.  The Catholic church is first made to look lost, then laughable, then evil.  All is set aright, however, when the village priest sets aside more traditional views and embraces the main idea of the film.    Conveniently, the priest's new views are delivered in a concise sermon... and acutal sermon, caught on film so that we cannot possibly miss the message of the movie.    The bottom line on this topic is that the film believes its message is more important than its story and it really shows.    I also must admit that I found the characters to be very shallow.  All the main characters are either monotone or two-tone (my term for being initially opposed to the protagonist, then suddently changed to being on the side of the protagonist with no interviening struggle).  The protagonist is uninteresting (no inner conflict).  The Johnny Depp character is even more uninteresting (a drifter who is immediately accepted by and is accepting of the protagonist; he brings nothing to the story, except for being yet another outcast that is a good person and enjoys chocolate).  The only character that is at all interesting is the town Mayor, Reynaud.   But even the fine acting of Alfred Molina cannot save this film.     The film is meant to be somewhat of a whimsical, mystical, fairy tale, so I can accept some lack of character depth or true conflict.  Because of this and for the film's beautiful setting, I'm not reducing it to 1 star, but I can't give it any more than 2.
020161622X|5.0|What I liked most is the personable style of writing of the authors. I never got bored while reading this book; it goes straight to the core of what you need. You may agree or disagree with some of the topics but you will definitely get a solid point of view. <br /> <br />This book is good as an abbreviated reference to keep right next to Code Complete 2nd  edition by McConnell.  <br /> <br />
1582403589|5.0|If anyone is a fan of Romero's work, you HAVE to pick this up. Great artwork with an incredible depth of character development. Makes each reading eager and eager for the next one to hurry and come out. A must buy for any zombie fan.

0451527046|4.0|Robert Louis Stevenson's _Treasure Island_ sets the standard for books about pirates: buried treasure, intrigue and mutiny, even the  ditty \\"fifteen men on a dead man's chest\\" all originate here.  The book, simply, is a FUN read.<br /><br />The story is told by Jim Hawkins, a young man who accidentally finds himself in the possession of a map to a pirate's buried treasure.  Embarking with a crew of familial friends (and a motley crew), Hawkins soon finds himself in the adventure of a lifetime: battling pirates, stealing a ship, and hunting buried treasure.  The \\"sea slang\\" one would expect in a pirate story can be found in abundance, with plenty of swashbuckling to go around.<br /><br />_Treasure Island_ is certainly readable for younger audiences, the story is exciting for anyone.  Recomended.
B000002IZM|3.0|Before ordering this product, you should be clear that this is NOT the complete music soundtrack of the movie.  It is, in fact, a combination of pieces in the Blade Runner genre (synthesizer effects, primarily), some that are only tangentially related, and pieces from the movie...often interspersed or overlaid with dialogue from scenic moments in the film.   <br /> <br />I found it less satisfying than a simple, complete rendition of the movie's music would have been.  That said, most of the pieces on the CD are worth listening, and a few are what I hoped for.  Three stars:  no more, no less.
B00002DEGZ|5.0|So far, not one reviewer here rated this unique set of Mozart's grand concertos below a perfect 5 stars.  I think everyone got it right on this one.  This is marvelously performed music that has can transport you back in your mind to the 18th century Vienna of Mozart's time - the scenes we all remember from the movie Amadeus with the beautiful period attire & white wigs, old-world European buildings & concert halls and especially that tiny pianoforte that Mozart played so dashingly.  Playing an exact replica of this fortepiano, Malcom Bilson wonderfully captures this period spirit with these most intimate-sounding concertos. While not superceeding the staturesque cycles of these works (on modern instruments) of Perahia, Brendel, Schiff, Uchida and others, these period performance bring a fresh - even nostalgic - perspective to this most historic of Mozart's music.<br /><br />There is something about Mozart's piano music that is brought out with great charm and energy on period instruments.  As much as we can admire the grand sound and range of a modern Steinway, Bilson's fortepiano here, along with the period winds and strings, all combines to create a magical and inspiring journey back in time.  Mr. Bilsons summons a Mozart-like virtuosity in the bouncy allegros and rondos with his quicksilver, dancing legato and spirited cadenza runs (many his own).  The period winds are especially wonderful here with their more penetrating, darker sonorities creating a pallitable sense of drama.  The orchestration from the English Baroque Soloists is incredibly rich and most distinquished in these recordings.  They create a powerful, edge-of-your-seat drama in the great D-minor (K.466) and C-minor (K.491) concertos that is memorable.  An equally brilliant and truly exceptional performance is seen in the great C-major concerto, K.367 as well.<br /><br />However, in the slow, lyrical movements - like the poinant larghetto in the 27th concerto or the 21st's famous andante - Bilson'smodest fortepiano cannot quite achieve the depth of expression that comes easily with the wider dynamic resources of the modern piano. Yet, Mozart's charming and tender writing still are there, and Bilson makes the most of the moment artistically with equisitely-musical performances.  (It is no wonder that Mozart - being the lyrical songwriter he was - became so enthusiastic upon the development and potential offered of the sustaining pedel).<br /><br />The only aspect of these recordings that I wasn't completely happy about was the balance between the often soft-spoken fortepiano solos (which are sometimes hard to hear) versus the orchestra coming in at full forte (ff).  I was reaching for volume knob more than I cared to.  This is the only aspect that keeps me from more frequent listening of these recordings.  Gardiner comments in the liner notes as to why this was an authentic way to conduct and record these concertos, which he describes more as \\"grand symphonic works with piano obbligato.\\" Still, it will be a \\"show-stopper\\" for some which is unfortunate.<br /><br />Overall, this set is a real gem in the world of Mozart recordings that can give a fresh perspective on the great piano concertos, including many earlier concertos from No. 5 onward that not often included in the later \\"great concertos\\" collections.  An now-discontinued coupling of No.20/24 received a Penguin Rosette rating, which should give the prospective buyer some idea as to the high quality of the music here.  Overall, a splendid bargin (about half the price of other complete cycles) and treasure not to be missed by the ardent Mozart fan.  Compositions - 5 stars; Performance - 5 stars; Sound quality - 4 stars; Instrument balance - 2 stars.

1400031354|5.0|Great reading.  It is a fun book that lets you forget your cares and worries for awhile.  Very interesting descriptions about Botswana.  The main character is known as having a \\"traditional\\" figure.  I think that means overweight.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|...and Wicked was what started it all!<br /><br />Sure, I was in chorus classes. We sang stuff from the classics, like \\"Ragtime\\" and \\"A Chorus Line.\\"<br /><br />But I never really, really loved Broadway.<br /><br />But after listening to the OBCR of Wicked, and seeing the show last week at the Gershwin, I am totally in love, and I don't see this love fading soon. In fact, it's spread. So yay about that.<br /><br />Stephen Schwartz is a gifted composer, especially in this case. A main melody is established very early on and though it may not be the main focus of attention, it's pretty much always there.<br /><br />On this recording, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel truly shine -- their chemistry is undeniable. (Plus--did you know that Nicole Kidman offered Chenoweth a role in \\"Bewitched\\" after seeing the show? Good bit of trivia for you.) Kristin is hilarious when necessary, but she also has the intensity required for such an emotional role. Idina knows just how to portray Elphaba's alienation and anxiety, love and dejectedness...she runs the gamut.<br /><br />On another note, even though Kristin and Idina are gone...still see the show on Broadway! Megan Hilty and Shoshana Bean are positively wonderful. I hope they get to rerecord this, actually.<br /><br />Some of the songs make me cry every time. I laugh too, when I remember some scenes. (\\"Not everyone gets to travel by bubble...\\") It's just an emotional rollercoaster of music for me. I wholeheartedly recommend this album. Thank you, and God bless.

B00005JNNZ|5.0|Ken Carter grew up in the tough ghetto of Richmond, California next door to Oakland.  He scrapped his way to most valuable player and record setter for points and assists at Richmond High School and earned a four-year scholarship in basketball to George Mason University in Virginia.  Twenty-eight years later he returns to his alma mater when an SOS is sent out by the veteran coach set to retire. <br /> <br />Carter is asked to return to Richmond and coach its basketball squad in this film adaptation of a true story.  The retiring coach is tired and seeking retirement.  Carter immediately sees the disarray the program has fallen into as players fight and curse one another after yet another losing game.  The team will compile a sorry 4-22 record, meaning that there is much work to be done. <br /> <br />Samuel L. Jackson, an Oscar Best Actor nominee for \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" turns in a brilliant effort as a coach who insists that his players seek to be the best human beings it is possible for them to become.  In this fast-paced Thomas Carter film, Jackson opens the first practice session by demanding respect.  There will be no more slurry, disrespectful comments and everybody will be called \\"Sir\\".  He then mandates that the players, who have been loafing in practice, work hard, sending them through long series' of tough back and forth running exercises called \\"suicides\\" and pushups.   <br /> <br />Once that the players get in shape and the meticulous Carter instills some solid offensive and defensive fundamentals in them they do the previously unthinkable.  The perennial doormat and laughing stock team begins garnering headlines by winning regularly, chalking up a winning streak of 17 in a row including one impressive tournament triumph. <br /> <br />The film then reaches its dramatic cornerstone.  Carter has insisted that in order to play all of his players must sign contracts to compile at least a 2.3 grade point average and go to class regularly.  When the progressive reports he has asked the teaching staff to compile are submitted he explodes, observing that his players have failed to keep their part of the bargain in the academics sphere. <br /> <br />It avails the players nothing when they protest that they have won 17 games in a row.  Carter brings the school's impressive winning streak to an end when they forfeit games and he padlocks the gymnasium, not allowing the team to practice or play games until they honor the contract with the coach by securing grades solid enough to enable them to enter college and become eligible for decent jobs and a good start in life. <br /> <br />At one point Carter is overruled by the school's higher ups, which instead opt for the easy route and ending the lockout.  After all, community pressure is strong and Carter is seen as a hard head, demanding too much at a time when the school is finally winning games. <br /> <br />The story takes an interesting turn when the players speak up.  One by one they begin to see that Carter is looking out for their best interests as human beings beyond the basketball court. <br /> <br />At a time when highly paid professional athletes have been resorting increasingly to spoiled and immature antics and the focus on winning has become in the eyes of many the only thing, this film comes as a breath of fresh air.  As sports commentator Bob Costas says in a brief segment playing himself, many Americans admire a man who insists that the term student athlete mean something, as Carter did.
B000002KB8|5.0|I'm sick of all these kids who think Nu Metal is \\"soooo original\\" and think they know better. \\"Black Sabath\\" is the first metal album and it's a lot more diverse than your Korny.

B00063MBU8|4.0|Simple Plan isn't for you if you are the kind of person you uses labels.  Simple Plan isn't punk, it isn't pop, it can't fit specifically into a genre of music.  It spreads over different genres.  Don't call them \\"posers\\" because to be a poser you have to try to be something you aren't.  And on several occasions members of the band have said that they aren't trying to be punk, they just want to play music.  If they were trying to pose as punk rockers, you can be sure that they'd have full arm tattoos and whatever else \\"posers\\" do to fit into the punk genre. <br /> <br />Still Not Getting Any... is an excellent collection of music that covers many emotions.  From fast to slow, and happy to sad and angry.  Simple Plan's music as a whole has matured from the previous CD (No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls) in that the themes of the songs are more mature even if the lyrics are still basic.  But I think that's what the \\"beauty\\" of Simple Plan's music is.  It is simple on the surface with words that just about everyone could come up with, but it is the way they are presented that makes them deeper than what they are on the surface.  I am in no way saying that they are lyrical geniuses, but the way Bouvier delivers the lyrics lets the listener know that those are his words and his feelings.  Simple Plan is able to connect with their fans in a way I rarely find.  This is especially apparent in their live shows, which, if you are even slightly a fan of their music, will enjoy. <br /> <br />So, basically, if you are interested in a CD that is fun and covers all range of emotions, pick up \\"Still Not Getting Any...\\" and go ahead and pick up their previous CD if you haven't already.  And if you are trying to appear \\"cool\\" or \\"punk\\", do yourself a favor and don't buy this cd, because you'll get hell for it.
0778321606|5.0|The Shop On Blossom Street is the story of four very different women who are brought together at a yarn store.  Lydia, the owner of the store is a two-time survivor of cancer who opens the store as an \\"affirmation of life\\".  Jacqueline is an uptight socialite who, while most people think she has the perfect life, is miserable and lonely in her marriage.  Carol longs for a baby and doesn't want to admit their might never be one for her and her husband.  And last but not least there's Alix, the street-smart, untouchable girl who's bark is worse than her bite.  The four become friends as they search for happiness. <br /> <br />As always, Debbie creates characters who readers learn to care about.  The characters are written in a way that makes them real people with real problems.  I found myself hoping for the best for each of them.  I even found myself wanting to learn to knit as I read. The way Debbie used this hobby was great.  Knitting wasn't written in just any old way.  It made sense and captured my attention as something I might try!   <br /> <br />There are surprises along the way that will leave you happy and wanting more.  At the end of the book I found myself wanting to know more about these people and their lives.  (It's a good thing there's a sequel!)  Debbie has once again delivered a great book with characters to capture your heart.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is craving a good read.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|This album shows off the quality of the band . Why 4 stars ? <br />The fifth star has exploded into fragments , because despite <br />great songs and superb musicianship the whole assembly goes <br />nowhere.

B000001EHS|4.0|Back in the 80's,one of the most succesful and one of the most important hair metal groups was,without question,Def Leppard. These guys weren't able to survive like Motley Crue,Bon Jovi,and Poison were once the hair metal era was dead and over with and grunge had taken it's place,but they put out some great music and enjoyed a lot of success. So,how does this compilation measure up? Read on for my review of this:    PROS:    Def Leppard's big hits are here-POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME,PHOTOGRAPH,LOVE BITES,ROCK OF AGES,among others-so if You're a new or a casual fan of Def Leppard,then this CD will give You a good introduction to them,and If You've been a loyal fan of DL for years now,then You should be pleased with this compilation.    One unreleased song,WHEN LOVE&HATE COLLIDE was included on here,and having an unreleased song on a greatest hits compilation from a band is always a nice touch.    You get notes on the tracks in the liner notes in this album from some members of Def Leppard,so having that here is a nice touch,and You even get liner notes written about Def Leppard that were written by Peter Mensch.    The liner notes feature pictures of the band and it also lists a discography for all of Def Leppard's albums that had been released up until that point(this compilation came out in 1995)so having both of those here is a nice touch and it would also let a casual music listener know some of the Def Leppard studio albums that are also available if he/she wanted to get some of them.    CONS:    The accoustic versions of TWO STEPS BEHIND and MISS YOU IN A HEARTBEAT are replacing the original versions of those songs on here-if it was against the eighty minute time limit on a CD to have both versions of those songs on here,then what would be wrong with having the original versions on here and having the accoustic versions of those songs somewhere else? It was a big mistake by the record company that released this CD not to do that.    The liner notes in the back thatfeature comments from some of the band members of Def Leppard does NOT list what year the songs on here were originally released-could someone please tell me why that is?    OVERALL:  This is one of the best \\"hair\\" compilations that is still available,and it represents Def Leppard pretty well. Like I already said,this should serve good for someone who has been a fan of Def Leppard for many years now,and If You're a new or casual fan of Def Leppard and You want a taste of their music but You don't intend on buying all of their albums,then this should serve You just fine.
B000089CJI|1.0|I love the song Such great heights, but the rest of the album sounds like a cartoon or tetris is being played. It's gets stupid and the lyrics aren't good.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have to start my review with one simple question, why don't you make up your mind? When you reviewed ToT, everybody said it is too heavy and now with Octavarium it is too soft, well what do you want?    This is an incredible album that has everything we (the real fans) always want from DT, it is brilliant, never expected, surprising and most of all NEW this is not an Images or Scenes 2nd effort it is a total new sound form DT and for me that is something I always appreciate. I cannot understand the \\"fans\\" that destroy this album simply because it is not Images and Word (my personal favorite) but let's face it if you want Images go to you room and listen it again and again, me I'm just waiting a new DT album just to listen how they have evolve.    I have to agree with a few of you guys who mention the fact that Portnoy and Petrucci aren't the spotlight of the album, James and Jordan are and for me that is fantastic it was about time so there is one more fact to enjoy Octavarium on a different basis do it and you will find it simply fantastic.    I love the whole album but I'm going to stand up for one song, one everybody has destroyed I WALK BESIDE YOU, how can you say it is U2's sound it is not, and you can understand my point if you have listened to James's Mullmuzzler 2 that is the sound this song has, just listen \\"a simple man\\" and you will see what I'm talking about, so please do not  trash a song just because you want it, listen to all the music in which any DT member is involved and you will be pleased with all the music they deliver    Once again, DT delivers one helluva album that proves that a band that has proven themselves can still evolve.     Need to mention that Octavarium the song, is simply fantastic a major epic from Dream Theater, would be great listening live on its enterity.    By the way listenting to the root of all evil and octavarium Live is the best f****n experience of my live... I was at front row here at their mexico show and believe metheir are the bests of all time simple amazing heyy my wife love them too and she doesn't like prog music¡¡¡¡¡    DREAM THEATER RULES¡¡¡¡
B00008CLOA|4.0|Everyone's entitled to an opinion of this reissue but the amount of misinformation in many of these reviews is ridiculous! A supposed recording engineer complains about the different \\"mix\\" on the stereo  track, when in fact the original 2 track tape was used for it. It's the SAME MIX, DUDE. He also listens to the CD layer and that convinces him he doesn't want to buy an SACD player. Now that's a blatantly ludicrous conclusion. Listen to the SACD layer and then decide if you want an SACD player. No doubt the tape has aged somewhat, which may have someone prefer an original CD, but the original Harvest UK LP still creams any digital edition of this record. However, the stereo master tape was used to produce a NEW vinyl edition that sounds better than any of the digital versions ever produced. And the Amazon reviewer who was surprised at how good DSOTM sounds considering that it was recorded before \\"digital recording techniques\\" needs to get a grip on reality. Digital preserves music the way formaldehyde preserves frogs: kill it and it lasts forever. Ask Neil Young. Or Wilco, or Steve Albini. Analog still rules. It's how we listen.......
0792839730|5.0|This is definately the best war movie that I have ever seen (and I've seen em' all; Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates,Apocalypse Now, etc. etc.). The only word to describe this movie is epic, with its expert direction from Sir Richard Attenborough and his equally expert cinamatography. Yessir, a top-notch movie and the perfect war film.
B000063DFN|5.0|This album is just absolutely mind blowing. From the high-flying opener 'Aces High' up to the epic 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner', this album just never stops. 'Aces High' is a fast, catchy song with blazing guitar solos. '2 Minutes to Midnight' is a powervul anti-war song about the doomsday clock that has some very gory imagery, not to mention, it also has some great guitar solos coming from Adrian Smith. 'Losfer Words' is Maiden's second best instrumental song (second only to the classical Transylvania). 'Flash of the Blade' is song about sword fighting that has one of the most memorable opening guitar riffs. 'The Duellist' is another sword fighting song, this one is mostly instrumental and reminds me a lot of 'Where Eagles Dare' from the Piece of Mind album. 'Back in the Village' is the worst song on the album, but is by no means bad at all. 'Powerslave' is the second best song that Bruce has written (second only to Revelations). 'Powerslave' has some memorable egyptian-sounding riffs and also has one of the best instrumental parts in the middle of the song. The instrumental part in 'Powerslave' starts out slow with a soft bass/guitar solo but then explodes into one of the best guitar solos you will ever hear. 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' perfectly closes off this classic album. it is the longest Maiden song to the day, and with the exception of the poem in the middle of the song, the energy in this song just never stops.  <br />Bottom line is, your metal collection isn't complete if you don't own this album. Powerslave, and every other Maiden album with the exception of a few, is the epitome of what good music really is. If you don't own this album, do yourself a favor and purchase it know!
B00000294R|5.0|This cd is just amazing. Big L is absolutley a genius his punchlines are crazy and is double rhyming evryline is just as sick as it gets. <br /> <br />1.Put it On-5/5  this song is crazy nice beat, L just rips to track to pieces.\\"and when it comes to gettin nookie im not a rookie, i got girls that make that chick tony braxton look like whoopie\\" <br /> <br />2.MVP-5/5   dope verse from L on this one. \\"Everytime im in a jam i always find a loop hole- i gotta crime record longer then munute bol. <br /> <br />3.

B000002H2H|5.0|This album, along with Master of Puppets, is Metallica at their peak. This album is one of the best thrash metal albums that is rivaled only by a few (Rust in Peace from Megadeth). The album starts out with a soft guitar piece that makes you wonder if you purchased the right album, but then the heaviness kicks in and off we go. 'Fight Fire with Fire' is a fast song with blistering guitar solos that tells about nuclear warfare. The pace is slowed down just a tad in the next track, 'Ride the Lightning', but it is still a killer track that has some of Dave Mustaine's cheesiness in it. The subject matter of this song is about the electric chair.'For Whom the Bell Tolls' is even a tad slower than 'Ride the Lightning' but like its predecessor, its still great. Next comes 'Fade to Black' wich in my opinion is the best track on the album. It's a slower track with a beautiful intro to the song and has some great instrumental work towards the end that neatly matches the subject matter of this song. Speaking of the subject matter of 'Fade to Black', don't ever listen to this song if your feeling suicidal. The pace is quickened once again in 'Trapped Under Ice'. I especially love the quick guitar solo before James starts singing. The next track, 'Escape', is the weakest track in the album, but as a testimony of how great this album is, 'Escape' is a great song. The following track, 'Creeping Death', is one of the highlights of the album with it's long solos and memorable opening guitar riffs. The album closes off with 'The Call of Ktulu' which is an excellent instrumental song that is on top with some of the best instrumental songs ever like 'Orion' and Maiden's 'Transylvania'. This album is indeed a classic metal album that is a must own. I definetaly feel that this album is better than the Black Album by a large margin. Purchase this album, you won't regret it.
B000268QB2|5.0|Tim Rice-Oxley's piano, Richard Hughes' drums and Tom Chaplin's smooth vocals blend beautifully to produce some of the most pleasant pop ballads to be found on one album.  In stark contrast to the swelling Coldplay anthems, it's hard to believe that an album could be this good without a single guitarist, but you never miss them here.<br /><br />Released over a year ago, the fact that it's still around speaks volumes about the quality of the music, and comparisons can be made to other late bloomers like Five for Fighting, Jason Mraz, Maroon 5 and Gavin DeGraw, who all took a while to settle in before finding their collective feet.<br /><br />All the songs are worth listening to, but the rapid repeats are \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" the emotionally charged lead off song; \\"Everybody's Changing\\", a poignant cry about not fitting in; \\"Bend and Break\\" with it's soaring and unforgettable chorus; \\"Can't Stop Now\\"; and the grande finale \\"Bedshaped\\".<br /><br />The slower \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" brings memories of an Air Supply ballad, as does the slow starting \\"This is the Last Time\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a great pop ballad.<br /><br />(Note: The import version has a bonus track \\"On a Day Like Today\\", but costs a lot more)<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 5, 2005
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is speed/thrash metal at it's finest. This album combines all of Megadeth's best aspects which includes fast paced songs with some great guitar work and Dave Mustaine's cheesiness which actually works. 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due' is a fast paced opener with a long but fast prelude that really sets the stage for such a great album. 'Hangar 18' is the hit off this album. I especially love the way the pace of the song changes from time to time. 'Take No Prisoners' is the other big hit off of Rust in Peace. It's a good song and all, but I'm just not a big fan of the Rattlehead voice that is present in this song.'Five Magics' is another good song that has a lot of changes in the pace of the song. I think this song is the second best song on the album (second to Hangar 18). 'Poison was the Cure' is a short fast paced song that is a different from the other songs in this album, but it's still enjoyable. 'Lucretia' is another solid track that is a little slower than the rest of the album, but still has some good guitar work (which should come to no surprise becasue after all this is Megadeth we are talking about). 'Tornado of Souls' is another awesome track, and in my opinion the 3rd best track on the album. I love the opening of the song with it's memorable quick riff. Dave Mustaine sings this song perfectly. 'Dawn Patrol' is the undisputed filler of this album. This song might appeal to you if you really like the bass and drums. I usually skip 'Dawn Patrol'. 'Rust in Peace...Polaris' is another great song with an excellent drum intro and is just full of energy throughout the song and has some short but fast guitar solos. After 'Rust in Peace...Polaris' come the demo tracks, which I'm not particularly fond of so I won't bother commentating on them. One other note, I have just recently started listening to Megadeth within the past year, so I've never heard the original version of 'Rust in Peace' because I own the remastered version of it, so therefore I can't havea word on Dave changing the songs a little bit. This is a great album and is one of if not THE best thrash metal album. I hear the songs have been tweaked a little from their original versions, but nontheless, I feel it doesn't really matter, because this album is just so great. So go out and buy this album it you haven't yet.
B0000029DD|5.0|July 2005.  I bought this CD two weeks ago simply for the \\"Hallelujah\\" cover (it's a Leonard Cohen song), and am blown away by how much I love every song, including the small hit he had from the \\"Last Goodbye.\\"  I feel like I should have paid attention to all those great reviews of his music I'd read over the years, because I missed out on enjoying him for far too long.  This CD is in my CD player 24/7 now, as I work to absorb every nuance, note, and word (I'm a musician, so I like to really throw myself into a CD/song).  I intend to own everything he's done (thank you, used CD stores, I'm too broke to buy new every time!).  If you're curious at all, buy this CD.  You'll fall in love with it.
0375713751|1.0|This book IS mildly entertaining throughout, but the characterization and plot start to fall apart after the first chapter. In addition, I know this is fiction, not a sociological treatise, but the more I read, the angrier I became. The \\"morals\\" of the story seem to be: <br /> <br />1)It's impossible to be a good mother and a working mother;  <br />2)Women are inherently better at child-raising and keeping house - so why bother asking men, those silly dears, to do their fair share? and  <br />3)If you do dare to try to have a career or your own identity in addition to a family, your husband will leave you.  <br /> <br />In short, it depresses me that the book received such rave reviews, because it's a giant step backwards for feminism. Could someone please write a lighthearted novel about a happy stay-at-home dad; a single mom who manages to be a great role model while providing for her family; or a two-parent household in which both parents work and share the domestic responsibilities, with reasonable success? These people exist. I know them.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Few 90s albums are as groundbreaking as this. But because an album is influential, doesn't qualify it as being good or listenable. This is, however, in addition to influencing a lot of below-par indie rock acts, is great, catchy, and definatly warrents repeat listenings. I can see easilly why indie and alt rockers were taken by this album. The briliantly lo-fi recording only enhances the feel (not exactly sure why this needed to be remastered, it sounded good the way it was). Also, this is a rare album without any filler. Not a single skipable track on this disc. Despite the fact that Pavement may has paved the way for many horrible bands (Bright Eyes), you can't hold it against them. I'm sure Steve Malkmus never meant to lay the groundwork for them. As for the songs themselves, they're some of the catchiest I've ever heard. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the recording sometimes obscures the fact that these are perfect pop-rock songs. Weezer could only dream of being this catchy. What can I say? If you considor yourself an indie rock kid, this should already be in your collection if you have any appreciation of your roots.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|OK, now we're getting somewhere!  After the childish, 1000-note-per-second disaster that was Train of Thought, Dream Theater's new follow up is a breath of refreshing air.  They have returned to a more song-oriented format, yet still retaining the strong musicianship and progressive characteristics the 5 fellow from Long Island do so well.  It's a great pleasure to listen to a new Dream Theater recording that doesn't sound like a 70 minute long Mike Portnoy drum solo and an equally long John Petrucci guitar solo.  The restraint, mature approach and better leap toward songwriting forms from these fine musicians on this new release was well worth the wait.   <br /> <br />I find myself really enjoying some of the slower songs, such as 'The Answer Lies Within,' more than their typical heavy-bombastic numbers.  However, the CD still contains the usual Dream Theater fare with songs such as the aggressive 'Panick Attack' and the modern-sounding 'Never Enough.'  I noticed some reviewers complaining that there wasn't enough instrumental music on the record.  Though there isn't a full instrumental SONG, there's still plenty of musical ear candy throughout the CD (see the middle section of 'Sacrificed Sons').  For those who say Dream Theater has \\"abandoned all of their progressive routes,\\" don't believe it - that's hogwash and an exaggeration.  Interesting enough, some of the songs do, indeed, resemble the more common modern rock/metal sound such as bands like Muse which is an slightly unusual approach for the usual Masters of Prog.  Though some reviewers have panned that characteristic, I find their lean towards a modern rock/metal sound not only pleasurable but sensible.  After all, the idea of progressive music is to \\"PROGRESS\\" and not to stay exactly the same, correct?   <br /> <br />With all that being said, I'm still sticking with a 3-star rating because of a few reasons.  First off, in general, the song writing isn't stellar by any means.  Their move toward a song-oriented CD is a step in the right direction, but they still haven't hit their peak unfortunately, missing just slightly with a lack of strong memorable melodies and/or melodic chord structures.  2nd, I feel that this is not their best release lyrically either.  In fact, there are a few songs on this CD that I felt were very weak in the lyric department for Dream Theater's standards.  And lastly, for a band that broke out on the scene with great fervor and such a noticeable idenity, it seems that Dream Theater has wavered in the past few releases with who they really are.  I feel myself getting dizzy from CD to CD due to such exteme diversities.  Maybe it's their attempt to \\"progress\\" as mentioned above...or maybe it's just an illustration of a band who has lost a good chunk of identity.  Whatever it is, this is a  good step for them, but it may take yet another recording to reach their \\"superior\\" status.
0446677450|5.0|The book Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one I would highly recommend.  I am lucky that I get to spend a lot of time around teenagers. I have as many of them as I can get to read this book do so.  I have copies of it to loan out.  When they read the book they always thank me. I wish someone gave this book to me when I was in my late teens. <br />Having seen my parents go from being financially secure to struggling was an eye opener for me.  Mr. Kiyosaki's teachings are worth studying.

B000063JDE|2.0|I've lived in the suburbs all of my life, and I wouldn't live anywhere else. As I look back over the years, some neighbors were quirky and most experienced some form of difficulty in their lives, but most were very decent people. Was there a secret \\"dark underbelly\\" to the 'burbs? Not really, except for the dads who hid Playboys in their offices, couples who divorced, and parents who aborted their unborn children, deemed \\"defective\\" through amniocentisis. <br /> <br />In fact, as often as not, most people that I remember lived lives of quiet heroism, not desperation. Does this film reveal anything besides a diseased mind? None that I can think of. Like most celebrated modern artists, intellectuals, and writers, Lynch's work probably reflects his private vices more than any existing reality. <br /> <br />Sure, David Lynch can present intriguing, dark and mysterious images. But in the end they're just that, a string of intriguing, dark and mysterious images, ultimately leading nowhere. If the idea of walking through a dead-end labyrinth appeals to you, then you'll like this movie.
0767903862|5.0|Everything I've ever heard about Australia makes it sound like a fascinating place.  This books confirms that impression and elaborates on it greatly.  Bryson's writing is extremely vivid and many his anecdotes are very funny.  I suspect that few travellers see as much of Australia as Bryson has, and here is a wonderfully quirky overview of a equally quirky land.  Bryson touches on almost every aspect of life \\"down under,\\" from politics, to geology and zoology, to culture, and well beyond.  This book is entertaining and informative, and may be the next best thing to traveling to Australia yourself.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book (page 5):  This is a country that loses a prime minister and that is so vast and empty that a band of amateur enthusiasts could conceivably set off the world's first non-governmental atomic bomb on its mainland and almost four years would pass before anyone noticed.  Clearly this is a place worth getting to know.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Bullets is my favorite cd right now and maybe of all time. There isn't much I can say about this cd except it is awesome. This is a more raw and hardcore MCR than the cd Three cheers for sweet revenge and if you liked TCFSR than you will love bullets. The only thing I can add is you need this cd even if you don't like MCR you NEED this cd! After all, all we are is bullets anyway and I mean this.
B00011RPB0|4.0|Lost in Translation tells the story of two people, basically alone in a foreign-speaking country, who share a connection. Bill Murray did a great job of portraying a somewhat washed-up actor who is flying overseas to make commercials. Scarlett Johansson, a lonely newlywed with a busy husband, lounged around her hotel room in her underwear, looking out over the Tokyo skyline. The two happen to meet in the hotel bar, and they spend the week together, exploring the city and getting to know one another.<br /><br />This movie is not epic. It is a small movie. But it also very delicately addresses the subject of confluence, convergence. Adrift in a sea of people who look different from you, speak a different language from you, can you make a connection? Can you share something with someone? Sofia Coppola's answer is yes.<br /><br />This is Coppola's second feature-length work. (The Virgin Suicides was her first.) I look forward to seeing what she does next.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best Eagles effort to date. The harmonies are rich, the production complete flawless, and the quality of their live performance better than ever. They are truly taking \\"One Day at a Time\\" and are better for it. Don't pass this one up.
B0000009SY|5.0|Kids in high school don't read record reviews, they hear records in their friends' cars or in a messed up, smelly bedroom. That's how I heard Joe's Garage. This was a record addressed to  juvenile delinquents all over the world, because it very well captured everything you knew adults knew about the world, but wouldn't tell you. Sex, drugs, easy chicks, dumb guys, venereal disease, prison sex, prison, fascism and the \\"man\\" trying to put you down (ie. your high school principal). Adults trying to \\"review\\" a record like Joes Garage will never get the point because it was written to ridicule them. As a teenager, this record was a Godsend because the words were funny and true as hell, had lots of melodies we could all sing drinking beer and more, nasty guitar solos and had some astonishing musical ideas within it.<br /><br />Unlike most adults, Frank Zappa didn't talk down to kids or lie to them and he certainly didn't talk down to them musically. He knew that kids could understand and sing along to bizarre and complex musical presentations because their brains had not yet not rotted off and they were still capable of receiving new ideas and digesting them. So he relentlessly filled Joes Garage with them. There is some astonishingly complex, inventive music on these grooves. Who else was making  music anywhere like this in 1978? Frank Zappa actually treated his teenage listeners like living, thinking, growing human beings -- not dumb, amoeba-like automatons designed to be fed demographically targeted pablum to sell the maximum number of units.<br /><br />As a teenager, I was drawn to Act I much more than Acts II and III because the latter are much darker and mostly instrumental. Now as an adult I find Acts II and III much more attractive. Act I is party music, Act II is very weird and raunchy party music (which is what we craved as teenagers at 3 a.m. in a gravel pit) and Act III is just plain defiant and sad. This is music teenagers would like to make if they could make it because it goes through all the tribulations and is unrelenting in its honesty, its sadness and its funniness. In these records, Frank Zappa dropped a protective layer of cynicism and let it all hang out. That's why Acts II and III contain some of the best and most emotional playing he ever recorded. It's very obvious he put a lot of heart and weight into this stuff and he knew it was going to be severely trashed by every sad, balding, overweight 30+ \\"record reviewer\\" who heard it. But he didn't care. His instincts were right. I can't recommend these records to anyone because they weren't written for people who take advice from record reviews. For musicians or aspiring musicians, I recommend it extremely highly. A number of compositions and performances on this will rip out your short hairs. Peter Wolf's keyboard playing and Vinnie Colaiuta's drumming are standouts. The production and recording are beautifully done. Ike Willis' vocals are sublime yet insane (ie. Lucille and Why Does it Hurt When I Pee?). Frank's guitar solo on \\"Packard Goose\\" is probably the most intense and angry work-out I have ever heard. The songs \\"He Used to Cut the Grass\\" and \\"Outside Now\\" contain playing that is radically outside but not abrasive and remind me of the sad, elegaic playing of David Gilmour at Pink Floyd's most dark moments. \\"Yo Cats\\" and copy cats will never capture these emotions in instrumental playing because they are always smiling or frowning for the camera. The Joes Garage records contain some awfully direct and honest material which is why I still very much like them.<br /><br />
B0000A118M|5.0|Coltrane has long been emblematic for me in the best that jazz has to offer. A relentless searcher. Tireless dedication to craft. Most importantly, a desire to use jazz as a language to speak and to move as opposed to just entertainment or a vehicle to show dexterity or technique. \\"A Love Supreme\\" isn't what I would recommend to someone listening to Coltrane for the first time unless they're into some of the more passionate forms of jazz or want to see what 60s stuff sounds like. \\"Giant Steps\\" or \\"Coltrane's Sound\\" are more accessible entry points that feature ballads for those who are intimidated by Coltrane's cries. \\"A Love Supreme\\", though, for many, represents the essence of 'Trane. Raw, uninhibited. A man who has overcome heroin, practiced obsessively to capture for a moment his connection to the universe. Jimmy Garrison is highlighted here with some of his transitions between the movements on bass. The chanting in \\"acknowledgment\\" and the hymnlike final movement are what this album is best know for, but the middle movements are blues based and connect some of 'Trane's live extended blues performances like \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" on \\"Live at the Village Vanguard\\" to a spiritual expression.<br /><br />I love this album and listen to it often and I encourage you to do the same.<br /><br />10 stars!<br /><br />--SD
B0000009S3|5.0|I spent a lot of time listening to Hot Rats as a teenager trying to learn keyboards. Played it at 16 rpm to figure out the fast parts. The long stretches of instrumental improvisation were very intriguing because I had already heard a lot of live Jimi Hendrix on record. Hot Rats was similar, but different. Several of the melodies are quite complex and fast, and the horn harmonies can be quite dense. This was pretty dense stuff for a 16 year old but I really liked it in an innocent 16-year-old way and just kept playing the record over and over and it started to click. I still like it very much today. Like most of Frank's stuff, it's not easy listening music -- it definitely demands something from the listener. But, he does provide singable melodies and a good funky backbeat throughout so folks can have some guideposts as they probe deeper. Sugar Cane Harris' violin playing is excellent as are all the players contributions. Captain Beefheart's singing on Willie the Pimp (and the words) keep things from getting high brow and serious. So does Ian Underwood's sax entrance in Gumbo Variations. Ian was fully capable of playing a \\"sweet sound\\" but instead he plays a monstrously bent-reed series of notes meant to jar you out of complacency. I really like Frank's guitar playing on this. He uses a very dirty tone and technique. In places it's downright grubby. I like that.<br /><br />Given the compositions and the musicians he could easily have played in a mellow, polite and sophisticated \\"jazz guitar\\" style but he didn't. Instead he lets the guitar honk and make strange, raw noises that most producers would cringe at. If you listen to Johnny Guitar Watson's solo on \\"Three Hours Past Midnight\\" you'll understand the effect. I like Frank's guitar playing on this because he allowed himself the freedom to put edge and dirt into his playing as part of the composition, something he learned from a lot of the severely underappreciated blues and R&B guitar guys from the 1940s and 1950s. The guy was into contrasts. So what he did in Hot Rats is combine very talented musicians, some fairly detailed arrangements, complex horn charts and played some gut-bucket raunchy guitar over it. Some people don't like this combination, but I do. A very nice record that will challenge folks, be an inspiration to some, and be liked by many for a long time.
B0006399FS|3.0|u2 are back in 2004...but i think they've lost their fresh, angry sound and lyrics of the beginnins and even their experimental sound of the 90's that makes them original.now they make still good music...but nothing fresh or original <br /> <br />vertigo - very catchy and good rock song!I can't stop me when i  listen to this song,but lirycs are not original.9/10 <br /> <br />miracle drug - one of the best u2 songs...i like the guitar riff at the end.10/10 <br /> <br />sometimes you can't make it on your own - very good lyrics,it's very emotional,but the sound it's already heard.8/10 <br /> <br />love and peace or else - i like the electro-beginning of this song.it's very adrenalitic.8.5/10 <br /> <br />city of blinding lights - i don't like very much this song,maybe because it reminds me \\"where the streets...\\".this song it's nothing new in u2.7/10 <br /> <br />all because of you - my favourite track on this album...i like rock'n'roll sound on it.10/10 <br /> <br />man or a woman - maybe the worst u2 song ever!the sound it's horrible...what's this?soul or something similar?...boring.0/10 <br /> <br />crumbs from your table - nice song,i like the guitar riff.8/10 <br /> <br />one stop closer - it reminds me \\"the million dollar hotel o.s.t.\\" sound,but it's a little boring.6/10 <br /> <br />original of the species - i like the lyrics but even in this song i don't like the sound.too sweety and less original.6.5/10 <br /> <br />yahweh - i don't know if i like or dislike this song...it's indifferent for me.6/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Sufjan's music is really a gift. Illinoise has the wild big sound of A Sun Came and Greetings from Michigan, but also demonstrates the intimacy and stylish storytelling of Seven Swans. This album takes the listener to the smallest snapshots of middle America's great white city and also to its glittery shimmering heights. Highlights are found in Chicago, Decatur, and John Wayne Gacy, but every song serves to make this an excellent album.    Edit** One reviewer seems to be disturbed that a religious artist would discuss his views on life and reality. Sufjan is a Christian. If Christianity offends you in abstract this album will do just that, but to call this album some kind of subversive way of proselytizing young people smells like paranoia. 7-12-05
B0009A1AS2|5.0|ahhh the inner struggle with this site goes on and on in my brain. On one hand I love the ability to read intelligient reviews of new and old material by my favorite musicians. On the other hand I get, as many have expressed here, sick and tired of the internet scum who give poor ratings to artists just for the hell of it. I love DT's Octavarium release and wouldn't dare compare it to any other release including Images and Words. Would the comparisons please stop all ready, it is a bit rediculous. Get over it, move on and stop living in the past. Stop expecting that performance everytime a new release by this band comes out and start opening up your mind and soul to the new material. Sadly this sort of thing happens to so many artists. Satriani and Surfing comes to mind. The Satch releases incrediblly consistent top notch material and all many can say is \\"it ain't Surfin man\\", please take a long walk off a short peer\\" DT releases consistently top caliber material, appreciate it and enjoy it because when they are gone who will replace them? If you really listen carefully to Octavarium you will acknowledge how they all have matured and how incredible the music is. I waited with anticipation for this release and because I am open minded I don't expect new material to sound like OLD material. One of the many reasons I choose not to listen to corporate shlock is that I enjoy artists who evolve. Listening to a group churn out the same sounds is boring, contrived and disappointing. A bit of old mixed in with progressive creativity is what keeps me interested. Great job DT as usual and thank you for spoiling me with quality, something rarely found in today's musical theater. I must mention that I read a review that stated the track selection was a problem with Octavarium and I would have to agree. Track #2 should be further down in the order and These Walls possibly 1st or 2nd. It all really makes little difference however because Octavarium tends to make you forget petty little things like track order.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Sadly, many, many critics (and others) just didn't \\"get\\" this movie.  <br /> <br />This special effects extavaganza is simply a tongue-in-cheek, campy homage to the greatest monsters of the 30,s 40s, 50s and 60's.... Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolfman. Not to be condescending, but it is incomprehensible to me that so many critics simply couldn't understand this.... as obvious as it is. How can you watch David Wenham's portrayal of Friar Carl and not recognize this??? <br /> <br />Dracula's wives were absolutley terrific... and just as I had envsioned them from Stoker's novel (with an added campy line or two). Glad I didn't see that part of the movie when I was 7 years old..... I wouldn't have slept for the next 7 years!. Dracula was excellent.... melodramatic sometimes, frightening the next. He had the look and feel down pat (and the CGI Dracula late in the movie was a might impressive, too). <br /> <br />Frankenstein's monster was also excellent.... just the right mix of pathos, humor and terror. LOVED the electricity buzzing around his head! <br /> <br />Wolfy didn't have all that much screen time, but he was appropriately scary with the best transformation scenes ever. <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale was there pretty much for her looks (which was ok with me). Although her accent was terrible, it was easy to overlook considering the campiness of the movie. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing was superb... fine acting sometimes, and you'd swear he's looking and winking at the camera the next. He seemed to truly have a feel for the intent of the picture. <br /> <br />The sets were incredible.... just perfect on all counts. The sequence where they are flying down the mountainous road in the coach (and all that went with it) was gorgeous to look at and exhilarating to watch. The castles, the village..... Just WOW! <br /> <br />Look..... If you haven't seen this picture, watch it understanding that it's INTENDED to be campy, yet pay proper respects to the monsters of old, all the while with great effects and a decent story. IT\\"S NOT INTENDED TO BE \\"GANDHI!\\" If you have already seen it, try again with the proper attitude.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Good CD!  Reminds me of the heavier (earlier) days of Nine Inch Nails. Falls short in a few places but makes up for it in the songs that are really great! Seems like it takes some elements from Pretty Hate Machine & The Downward Spiral and *poof* you get With Teeth. ALL NIN fans will love this CD. Does not come with any kind of CD insert or lyrics or liner notes of ANY kind (which I tend to like) but that does not affect the music.<br /><br />Standout tracks include: \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", \\"All The Love In The World\\", \\"You Know Who You Are\\" and my personal favorite; \\"With Teeth\\".<br /><br />The rest sort of have to grow on you and as any NIN song they will keep creepin' until you can't get enough!
0767802470|5.0|This film is brilliant in virtually every way. It's certainly the most authentic sea war movie ever made. The claustrophobic sets and direction truly take you for a U-boat ride and let you experience the sheer terror of depth bombs and other dangers. The english dubbing is extraordinarily well done; but watching the film with dubbing makes you lose just a bit of dialogue from the film's original German language. The Director's Cut DVD features English and German Dolby 5.1 soundtracks, as well as a Spanish and English 2.0 Dolby Surround track. There's also a commentary track featuring the director of the film (Wolfgang Peterson), actor J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and producer Ortwin Freyermuth. Also, if you prefer to watch the film in it's original German language, the disc features English, Spanish, and French subtitles. Although the original aspect ratio is 1.66:1, the transfer on the Director's Cut DVD was done at 1.85:1. It is a beautiful anamorphic transfer with excellent sound. Das Boot is an extraordinary film, and definitely the greatest submarine film ever made.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is easily one of the best neo-soul  albums you may ever hear. In her sophomore LP, Alicia continues to evolve as an artist, collaborating with the likes of Timbaland in the funk-era single \\"Heartburn\\", and Kanye West in the soul-filled \\"You Don't Know My Name. Both producers (speaking of West and Timbaland), did an excellent job of not over-producing their songs, and taking away from Alicia's talent as an artist.    \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is arguably the best song ever recorded by Ms. Keys. Like \\"Fallin\\" from the Songs in A Minor album, its climactic, her piano play is unparalled, and her voice is perfect. Also, like her freshman LP, each of The Diary's songs have their own personality, and stirs up various emotions. \\"Karma\\" has the sound of a fed woman who's had enough from her man, while \\"Dragon Days\\" paints the picture of a woman in need of some affection.    Though this album isn't as good as the first, its still one of the best albums ever made. Alicia's ability to experiment with new sounds, her soulful voice, and her play on the piano has made her one of the most unique artists ever.
B00001PE4D|4.0|I have to be honest, I usually hate teen movies. I find their premise normally shallow and I am usually left unentertained. But surprisingly, I found that I was pinching myself several times while watching this movie because it is unbelievably good. It seems that this was actually a remake of another movie. I don't know if Cruel Intentions lived up to that movie, but one thing I do know...I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br />The story revolves around two siblings, Sebastian and his stepsister Kathryn. Kathryn is the very definition of a two-headed snake. She's prim and proper on one side, and a total b*tch on another. Sebastian meanwhile, is an open book. The whole world knows he's one charming jerk. Together, the two create havoc among their peers. They backstab and sweet-talk their way to getting things done for their own satisfaction. Kathryn proposes a new challenge for Sebastian, that he's to bed Annette, the new principal's daughter/virgin of the school. Sebastian of course, ends up falling in love with Annette, but will they end up together? Throw in some secondary characters, some plot twists and the result is a whole lotta fun. <br /> <br />A big part of why I enjoyed this show is definitely the cast. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a complete 180 degrees for her role of Kathryn. It was like the Buffy we knew was never there. She is so deliciously evil, manipulating everybody around her, twisting and turning facts to her advantage. Ryan Phillippe initially plays Sebastian cool as a cucumber, but ends up with feelings of pain and torment to reflect what his character is going through. Although it's not an Oscar-worthy performance, heck...it's really convincing and doesn't seem fake or pre-conceived. Reese Witherspoon plays Annette with spunk and the whole \\"women power\\" aura...the reluctant lover. Even the supporting cast, Selma Blair, Joshua Jackson and Sean Patrick Thomas were a delight to watch. I guess, it's because they play such different characters than what they're accustomed to play. <br /> <br />The script is also better than most teen garbage Hollywood throws at us. It stays away from the Land of Predictability, the plot twists were believable and the end was a stunner. Trust me, not your typical ending. And the music selection was also impressive, it gave the movie that extra feel. <br /> <br />In short, I really liked this movie. It's not groundbreaking, but it does stand out. I have since watched this movie at least 5 times, and never tire of it. Definitely recommended!
B00008EYA5|3.0|Loosely based on the TV series of the same name, \\"S.W.A.T.\\" is an entertaining, if essentially formulaic, police procedural set on the ribboned thoroughfares and sizzling pavements of metropolitan Los Angeles.  Samuel L. Jackson plays an LAPD veteran called back to the force to handpick and train a crack SWAT team made up of promising neophyte recruits.  Colin Farrell, LL Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez are the actors who make up part of that team.<br /><br />The creators of \\"S.W.A.T.\\" have done a pretty decent job given the limitations of the genre.  It's true that the plot is standard issue stuff for the most part and the characters have little opportunity to distinguish themselves and develop.  However, the dialogue is frequently crackling and the performers go through the motions with seriousness and conviction.  The action scenes are also well handled, even if they do go a bit overboard from time to time, a problem endemic to virtually all action films these days, not just this one.<br /><br />Chances are you probably won't remember a thing about \\"S.W.A.T.\\" much past its closing credits, but it's a fun enough ride while you`re watching it.
B00004XONN|5.0|And Radiohead has evolved. In case you haven't heard this CD, this review may be helpful. <br /> <br />I remember hearing Creep a long time ago when I was a teenager and while that song is great it just wasn't as unique as the later songs of this band. The Bends was just a natural evolution on Radiohead's style and was by far much better than its predecessor, and you can say the same about OK Computer. <br /> <br />Later on, when Kid A was released I was expecting OK Computer part II. After all, that was a superb CD with unforgettable songs like Paranoid Android or Exit Music (for a film). Anyway, Radiohead is one of those bands who doesn't give a damn about what people may think of its works and they proved that with Kid A. <br /> <br />I compare this with Rubber Soul, of the Beatles, which was a turning point in their career and style. Kid A is not for people who like things like Creed, Beyonc or JLo. This CD requires maximum attention, maybe 5 listenings and an open mind to really like it, because its unlike anything made before by Radiohead. My best advice: don't expect to hear something like Creep, Karma Police or songs like that because you will be disappointed, very disappointed.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is a movie for ALL to see, people all over the globe, especially High School and College students.  <br /> <br />Rather than shocking by showing violence, we get a very rare glimse of history by the 85 year old Robert McNamera, who is a brilliant man with an incredible memory, and receites his memories not from a clinical view, but from a emotional factual view, AS HE SEES IT. He was right in the middle.  <br /> <br />I am 53 and lived through Viet Nam, but we also get glimses of WWI and especially WWII.  <br /> <br />We get to share the complexities, irrationality, insanity of war through McNamara's eyes.  <br /> <br />Although it about McNamera's life, I don't see this as really about jodging Robert McNamera, but more of looking at the judgments of our leaders and ignorance of our leaders, history and how decisions get made. <br /> <br />The analogies with the murder, occupation and attempted take over of Iraq by the U.S. government and its corporate interests can really be seen. <br /> <br />As McNamera says as one of his \\"rules\\", Empathise with the enemy. <br />McNamera talked about the mistake that was made on how we could not empathise, know and understand the Vietmese and totally misjudged why they were fighting.  <br />In the same way, we totally have misjudged, misunderstood Afghanistan and Iraq. But in this case, it is arrogence and money fueling this current occupation (where VietNam was not driven by   attempting to take over the country for Corporate reasons),  and really there is not caring about the enemy at all. We are loosing the Iraq, Afghanistan conflict as well.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, a very important point is that the United States has never come close to recovering from the assination of John Kennedy. That ended the post WWII feeling the Kennedy personnified of self-sacrifice, ethics, values, optomism, civil rights, humanism and The American Dream.

B00005JN2Z|3.0|One of the major problems I have with many action movies is that they seemingly attempt to suspend your logic to the point of insulting your intelligence-it really gets to be like a proverbial slap in the face after awhile. This movie, like many of its predecessors, follows some of the action film clich's: ordinary guy getting involved in an event over his head, somehow protagonist must save girl from danger, big car chases where many red lights are run and luckily no innocent citizens are run over, explosions, sharpshooters that somehow miss easy targets but hit difficult ones, the over-drawn chase and fight scenes, etc. For what it is worth, this is an entertaining film. It certainly held my interest for the most part, but it began to wane as the movie progressed. I found the first half of the movie was far more enjoyable than the latter half, and, as the second half unfolded, and with each new chase and each new murder by Cruise, I found myself rolling my eyes more and more at the preposterousness of it all. <br /> <br />For instance, are we actually to believe that sharpshooters from the LAPD and FBI units, as well as security guards are all going to fail to hit Vincent (Cruise's character) in the nightclub?  Equally implausible is the dancing that continues to go on as weapons are drawn, shots are fired, and commands such as \\"Put your hands in the air\\" and \\"This is the FBI\\" are being screamed at the club. Some liken Tom Cruise to a human, malevolent Terminator in this movie, and in this segment he plays out this machine-like quality to perfection, as he stoically and unemotionally beats down innocent by-standers and, well, calmly shoots innocent by-standers that happen to be anywhere near Max (Jamie Foxx).  <br /> <br />Perhaps a bigger illusion is the ridiculously implausible ending. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say it involves a car crash, a woman alone in a building, a chase, and two injured people with guns aboard a subway. It reallyis a let down when a movie tries to go so far over-the-top at the climax and conclusion, and Mann (director) does so at the point after the taxi crash to the extent where many of the \\"positives\\" of the movie are easily forgotten.  <br /> <br />Still, on a lighter note, an aspect of the movie that is rewarding is the acting in itself. Tom Cruise plays his rare role as a bad guy, a hit man, to perfection, and Jamie Foxx does an equally commendable job playing the easy-going cab driver with bigger goals in life. They seem to know their characters well, and it is Max, Foxx's character that shifts from the early part of the movie to the latter part. However, one problem about Foxx's character that was slightly an annoyance was the occasional muttering and mumbling that made his lines indiscernible.  <br /> <br />Overall, it was a decent film, but nothing meriting the 5 stars. It is a fun movie and it will be better if you can stretch your imagination and not be bothered by the usual clichs in action films.  <br />
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris, if you have not read him, is more than worth your while.<br />Very, very, very funny. Very real, very poignant. Somewhat this is the story of his life as kind of a gay Everyman- an alternately-oriented Charlie Brown if you will. The orientation issue is never overpowering, more woven in as it is added to the list of things that life has thrown at him that he must make the best of. The family is dysfunctional, but with a lot of character and even love, and keeps the stories from just being about a sad, rootless soul. The encounters with the machinery of southern public school, northern private commerce (as a pre-Will Farrel elf), and with France are exquisite. His life is one that we can identify with, maybe with a substitution here or there. His observational humor is clever, and his classic self-deprecating wit helps the reader to always want to root for him. There aren't, and I guess never have been, a lot of great humor writers out there (once you get past the Simpson's writers), but to me Sedaris can take his place with the best of them. I'm pretty conservative, but I know a good laugh when I see one, and a good book when I read one, and this is a very, very good book.
B0006L16N8|5.0|First of all i'm a huge fan of coldplay and not only is their lyrics soothing to listen to,but their sound is almost like U2's sound which i like!!!!! All of their albums are different and untique which is a plus and when i got a chance to listen to this album it had a mixture of pop, rock, tech, and much more!!!!! Their songs are great listening to and they also are either relaxing to listen or puts your body in energy mod!!!!! I would go get coldplay's stuff and not because Chris Martin is hot,but to listen to their sound and find out there style and where they like to take us in the life !!!!!! GO GET COLDPLAY TODAY!!!!
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Casino was Martin Scorsese's first attempt at a big budget, studio-backed epic. He would take the style and structure of GoodFellas and expand it on a much more ambitious level. Many criticized Casino as GoodFellas Part 2 but this is merely a superficial reading of Scorsese's movie. Casino completes his unofficial trilogy of gangster films. Mean Streets  is all about small-time, street-level hoods, GoodFellas is about mid-level crooks who wield more power and Casino is about the big time: gangsters who run large casinos that generate millions of dollars. With this film, Scorsese not only shows us how Las Vegas casinos were run by East Coast wise guys but the rise and fall of one man whose ambition overtook his grasp and his blind love of a woman that ultimately resulted in his downfall.<br /><br />Scorsese's film examines the notion of Las Vegas as being some sort of perverse paradise on Earth, a place where there were no limits. To this end, Casino features a vibrant, often garish colour scheme; loud, wall-to-wall music; and all sorts of excesses that illustrate the decadent nature of Las Vegas and how the characters in the film are consumed completely by it. Ace, Ginger and Nicky have too much money and are drunk on power. Ace deludes himself into thinking that he can always stay in control. He creates a false sense of security, believing that he could lead a normal life in Las Vegas<br /><br />Casino documents a bygone era that no longer exists. Now, Las Vegas has been taken over by corporations and become a theme park for the whole family. The film examines Las Vegas during its heyday when it was strictly a playground for adults.<br /><br />The first DVD features an audio commentary by Martin Scorsese, co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, editor Thelma Schoonmaker and others. This track is done in the style of a Criterion commentary with several participants edited together to eliminate dead air and provide multiple viewpoints... only not as good. As they did on the GoodFellas commentary, Pileggi and Scorsese dominate and talk about the film's themes in a very eloquent and engaging way.<br /><br />The second DVD starts off with an eight minute featurette entitled, \\"Casino: The Story.\\" There is quite a bit of overlap from the commentary track on this and the other featurettes.<br /><br />\\"Casino: The Cast and Characters\\" is a substantial look at the actors and the characters they played. While De Niro and Pesci appear in interviews done during the film's release, Stone contributes a brand new one and speaks candidly about how hard she campaigned for the role of Ginger. As she recounts her experiences of working on the movie, she is actually moved to tears in a very revealing moment.<br /><br />\\"Casino: The Look\\" examines how the period detail was achieved by production designer Dante Ferretti. Scorsese actually shot in Vegas casinos and talks briefly about the challenges of shooting in such a busy, noisy environment.<br /><br />\\"Casino: After the Filming\\" takes a look at the editing process. Schoonmaker talks about how Scorsese had already thought out the visuals and even some of the editing before shooting the movie.<br /><br />There are three minutes of deleted scenes that resemble outtakes more than anything else. There is a funny take with Scorsese's mom and Pesci goofing around on the set.<br /><br />\\"Vegas and the Mob\\" takes a look at the real life gangsters that the film is based on. It traces the rise of the Mob-run casinos in the `30s with Bugsy Siegel, to their demise in the `70s.<br /><br />One of the most substantial extras is a History Channel documentary about Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal. This is an informative, fact-based contrast to the stylish, fictionalized version in Casino.<br /><br />Finally, there are production notes.on the GoodFellas commentary, Pileggi and Scorsese dominate and talk about the film's themes in a very eloquent and engaging way. <br /> <br />The second DVD starts off with an eight minute featurette entitled, \\"Casino: The Story.\\" There is quite a bit of overlap from the commentary track on this and the other featurettes. <br /> <br />\\"Casino: The Cast and Characters\\" is a substantial look at the actors and the characters they played.

B0002WS3RS|5.0|Like most of Gong's albums, this has been released on CD a number of times.  The CD's have varying sound quality. They weren't horrible, but they weren't great. This remaster has excellent, beautiful sound.  It really brings out the atmosphere of the music. <br /> <br />The original album was 45 minutes long.  15 minutes of extra tracks have been added, bringing the CD to just under 60 minutes.  I don't think that any of the bonus tracks are all that great.  They aren't bad, they just don't make it worth buying this if you already have an older copy. <br /> <br />This remaster has a nice 8 page booklet, containing the lyrics and all the info on Gong and the Pot Head Pixies.  The only thing missing is the blue artwork that was on the inside of the gatefold of the original LP cover. <br /> <br />This is just another great Gong album.  It has some of the spaciest and wildest music of any of the Gong albums.  It also has a number of great songs.  While it is very spacy, it is also very coherent and holds together well.  The only downside is that there are a few short silly songs.   <br /> <br />This album is as good as You, but somewhat different.  There are more songs, and they are a bit shorter than what is on You. <br /> <br />Gong released 3 albums in the 1970's dealing with Radio Gnome Invisible and the Pothead Pixies (Flying Teapot, Angel's Egg and You).  In all, Gong released 5 to 7 albums in the 1970's (depending on how you are counting) before splintering.  The leader of the band, Daevid Allen left, and the remainder became a jazz fusion band. <br /> <br />Throught the eighties, Allen would reform the space version of Gong, and the jazz version got renamed Pierrie Moerlen's Gong.  The jazz band disbanded in the eighties.  <br /> <br />Allen reformed Gong permanently in the late nineties, and the band has put out a number of studio and live albums.  They are all very good.  The last three studio albums have carried on the story of the Pot Head Pixies.

B00005ASHM|4.0|The Beach Boys said it time and again: That The Beatles were their inspiration to keep writing good songs and produce better music (if only such competition existed in today's sick joke of a music market...) and Pet Sounds was inspired by, in my opinion, The Boys' best album, Rubber Soul (a record that wasn't heavy on the studio tricks as its close second, Revolver, was).<br /><br />America was, by 1966, still searching for a homegrown answer to top the boys from Britain, and Pet Sounds was supposed to be it.  A group that made its mark on the charts by singing about the beach and how superior one state's women (probably, again, from the beach) were to women from the rest of the country were supposed to be the answer.  I don't think so.  (Yeah, yeah, The Beatles sung about teenybopper love in the beginning of their careers but they progressed quite nicely.)<br /><br />I listened to Pet Sounds quite a few times with an open mind and the only three songs I wound up liking were the ones I liked before: Wouldn't It Be Nice, Sloop John B, and God Only Knows (which Paul McCartney, I believe, called one of the prettiest songs he ever heard).  It didn't grow on me and I wish I could have liked it more.<br /><br />I don't take away Brian Wilson's producing capabilities but The Beatles they were not nor could ever be.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Just because you don't understand the lyrics doesn't mean the songs are stupid.  True, Nightwish lyrics contain more metaphores, and reads out like poetry, thus harder to interpret...but it is definitely not stupid.   <br />Creek Mary's Blood tells of the Trail of Tears--basic American history stuff--where Native American lands were invaded by the white man.  Nemo means \\"nobody\\" in Latin so that should explain a lot.  And, in response to a previous question, I Wish I had an Angel is mostly about lust, but that thirteenth disciple analogy hints some betrayl as well.   <br />I don't feel like analyzing all the songs.  Besides, lyrics are often left to the interpretation of the listener so if you don't get, make up something.

B000002AZX|4.0|Obviously Leonard Cohen has numerous great albums out there, however this is one of my favorites. I consider \\"Various Positions\\" to be part of my essential trilogy, along with \\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"The Future\\". Truth be known, I almost skipped this review because I felt this album is beyond description. The music and lyrics are just absolutely amazing, and I feel bad for those who have yet to discover Leonard Cohen. This is one of few albums I can put on in my livingroom, and just stare out the window for 45 minutes. Listening to it is an event. His perfect songs \\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", and \\"If It Be Your Will\\" are all here, but I also love \\"Law\\", \\"Coming Back To You\\", and \\"Hunter's Lullaby\\". If looking for a collection, I suggest \\"More Best Of\\", or his 2-disc \\"Essential Cohen\\".
B00001QGPS|4.0|Meth & Red together = Fire, most of the time but not so much on this collabo.  Being 2 of the biggest names of the time and making a good amount of Hits together you would think this album would be nothing short of a classic.  Packed with 17 songs, you do get 2 classics (1 is an older song) a near classic (that's also older), 6 ok songs, and the rest are good, but not great.  Production is pretty good and the Green Eyed Bandit, Erick Sermon does more then half the songs, 9 of them (I have heard better from him as well), RZA, Mathematics & Redman each do 2, and Rockwilder, GovMatic, DJ Scratch all do 1.  Guests are minimal, rapping on 3 songs, and doing a hook on one.  A good album to have for their fans but I expected much more. <br /> <br />#2 - 8.5 (nice beat) <br />#3 - 8 <br />#4 - 7 <br />#5 - 8 (f/ LL Cool J & Ja Rule) <br />#6 - 8 (f/ Blue Raspberry) <br />#7 - 10 (CLASSIC -- Great beat even though it was overplayed) <br />#8 - 8.5 <br />#10 - 7.5 <br />#11 - 7 <br />#12 - 9 (f/ Street Life & Ghostface Killah -- great beat) <br />#13 - 7.5 <br />#14 - 8 (f/ Mally G) <br />#15 - 8.5 <br />#16 - 7 <br />#17 - 7.5 <br />#18 - 9.5 (great beat --- also on Method Man's \\"Tical 2: The Sequel\\") <br />#19 - 10 (CLASSIC smoking song, probably their best ever together even though it's been around since '95) <br /> <br /> <br />REDMAN --- Reggie Noble --- b. 4/17/70 --- Newark, NJ <br />METHOD MAN --- Clifford Smith -- b. 4/1/71 -- b.

B00004U2GH|5.0|I can safely say that any positive comment directed towards this album is 100% true. I have this on vinyl also, and this remaster is ten times as great. Just look at the tracklist here, it's practically a live hits album. Included is \\"I Walk The Line\\", \\"Darlin' Companion\\", \\"Boy Named Sue\\", \\"Peace In The Valley\\", \\"Ring Of Fire\\", and numerous other classics. However, what really makes \\"At San Quentin\\" amazing, is the between song chat between Johnny and the prisoners. It adds emotion and humor, and a real look at the kind of man Johnny was. This album alone solidified his status as rebel and legend. Another major plus besides the better sound and extra tracks is the price. This is the no-brainer of no-brainers. In summary, \\"At San Quentin\\" is the real Johnny Cash, it's real country, and even more than that it's just real good music.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Remember this is a DVD review not a movie review. This DVD gets a 0. Why? It is the typical bare bones release of a great movie. People will buy it, but will soon realize that the DVD is horrid and has no special features at all. Then a few months later another one will be released. Typical hollywood and thier double dipping. Do not buy this version. Wait untill the special edition. You know it is coming. <br /> <br />Hope everyone reads this.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|A great mix of oldies  (\\"God Only Knows\\" &  \\"Both Sides Now\\"), brand-new artists (Kelly Clarkson& Maroon 5), and irresistable haunters (\\"Here With Me\\" & \\"Glasgow Love Theme\\")!  <br /> <br />I bought this with another soundtrack-like CD, \\"Mastercuts Early Hours,\\" which features the same mix of oldies (Dusty Springfield & Marvin Gaye) and newbies (Organic Audio & Jhelisa), with a few obscurities you feel like you should know but don't (\\"Sunday Morning\\" by Velvet Underground seems so sweetly haunting, you can't believe it came from this band)! <br /> <br />So if you like the revisting those songs you loved on the same disc with some new experiences, then these are the CDs are for you!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This album may have silly lyrics now and then, but really, how many groups have lyrics that make sense these days anyway? The music is good, the singer and musicians are all very good, and for a debut album it is impressive and I can't wait for the next one. I just downloaded their new single from the istore, and it sounds excellent, and I know the next album will be even better.
B000089CJI|1.0|This band is terrible.  death cab for cutie is awful too and has a much uncooler band name.  do not buy this...as bad as metallica's new album.
B00081MUY0|5.0|Yes, this is the one we've been waiting for. However there is one very important track from the era not on the CD: that is the single version of The Trip, the b-side to Sunshine. This version featured a harmonica solo not on the LP version. They should have included this instead of the dublicate demos that are also on the others CDs of this series.
B000002LK1|5.0|i should be so lucky. i saw this record in a second-hand shop and i thought, why not? I heard a lot from DM but before this cd, i heard nothing, not a song from them.  <br /> <br />the first song, world in my eyes, is a brilliant one. it just sets the mood for some making out session, it's sexy, and the vocals are menacing, yet very seducing. <br /> <br />at first, i was like, \\"9 songs? Is this worth buying?\\" but i was so surprised to know that every song was made to perfection. \\"Enjoy the silence\\" is another great hit. DM is just one of a kind - it totally opens up a new kind of world to me, when it comes to music. I admit I'm spoonfed by MTV and now I realise there's more to music than what's played on the radio and mtv. <br /> <br />\\"Blue Dress\\" and \\"Clean\\" are very powerful songs that just elebvate your mood and then go on to make you feel reflective about yourself. Lyrically, DM is minimalistic, yet precise. It's refreshing to just listen to them chant/sing those words. <br /> <br />I think everyone should get this album. It's better than Ultra, their other effort.
0792162803|4.0|My question is this:does Superstar remind you of Napoleon Dynamite?Napoleon had all those funny moments,a dance at the end,it wasnt a big budget,set in a small town,but Superstar had something Napoleon could never get:a regular on Saturday Night Live.Superstar makes great fun adding all those classics in the movie(carrie,silence of the lambs,boy in the plastic bubble)But what bugged me was that Sky and Mary had more in common,then him and Evian.(''go drink a bottle of yourself'').He and Mary put Boy in the plastic bubble as their 19th favorite made for tv movie.I love the part when she makes out with the tree then say's she was helping to save the rainforest.I am recommending this to anyone who loved Napoleon Dynamite.
B00003CXCT|1.0|This is not the Star Wars I came to know and love. I can see the desire to want to try to improve on an old film, but to do so and act like the originals never existed is wrong. I can not give these movies higher than a 1 until the true original films are released as well.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Apart from those who want everything to stay the same just for the sake of staying the same, everyone will appreciate the digital editing that Lucas did on these. Everything done improved the films.
B00030590I|4.0|I watched House of Flying Daggers and liked it so much that i rented this the next evening. Good choice, the visualness of the movie is breathtaking. Moving from one dominate color to another to normal, as a technic to saturate your mind with one theme at a time.<br /><br />I like the highwire and swordplay, since that i the genre it doesn't feel fake but as expected. There is a twist were the emperor guess that he setup the whole thing and is there to kill him. I missed it until it was explict, having been to wrapped up in the details to see the big picture.<br /><br />The scenes are beautiful, moving around in China to get different places, something that might bother someone who knows where things are, in my ignorance i don't mind. There are lots or extras and a black sky of arrows, technics that overwhelm the senses, making the director and the camerapeople tops in this movie.<br /><br />watch in Chinese with subtitles, it feels better, to hear it right. worth buying and re watching.

0618164413|5.0|My 3-year-old son loves this book. It's a little bit heavy, but he can carry it across the room. These are some of his favorite stories and they have stood the test of time well.<br /><br />His favorite request is the one about George learning the alphabet. It's also the longest one as well and sometimes I grown when he asks for it at bedtime. All the letter shapes are present as pictures of things which start with the letter and both uppercase and lowercase are included. I'm no teaching expert, but it seems like he's learning a little bit about the relationship between sounds and letters.<br /><br />Some people have noted that the binding on this book is not strong. Ours seems indestructible. We've had this since Christmas (7 months ago) and with 2 active boys under 4, our house is no place for wimps or wimpy products. Maybe someone got one which is defective. Soft-cover books seem to fare much worse in our playroom.
B00092ZL80|4.0|This concert features two of the best acts in music for many, many years.    The concert was really in four pieces, both bands opening together, EWF primarily alone, then Chicago primarily alone,  then a strong finish together.    I personally thought the best parts of the concert are when they perform together.  I never could have imagined these two bands blending, but they did.  They seemed to really enjoy each others music, and performing each others songs.    Chicago's instumentals were totally wonderful.  I thought the vocals were pretty weak though, and was the weak link of the performances. Their voices thin and showing their age.  In spite of this, I still enjoyed it.    EWF performed very well both vocally and instumentally.  Together as stated, it was awesome.    Video and audio were very good, and they sure projected an image of two bands having a great time.    For two bands generally in their 50's and 60's, they played a very long crowd pleasing set.  I highly recommend you own this concert.    Jerry
0671027344|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC book! I read it simply because I was intrigued by the title, having been referred to as a \\"wallflower\\" myself. Although it has been compared to J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, I think it has a much more structured storyline and easier plot to follow. If anything I think it could be compared to the more modern book, You Don't Know Me (another book I highly recommend). Written through a series of letters to the person who \\"didn't sleep with that person at the party even though they could have\\", it opens a window into the main character's life that gives a view that is more personal than anything else I have read so far.  <br /> <br />The main character, Charley, struggles to discover who he is and who he can trust in a world where it seems like no one can be trusted and no one is who they appear to be. Living life on the sidelines, Charley notices things about human nature that most of us just brush off. He becomes very sensitive to little things (and, I will admit, he cries an awful lot). Upon seeing his talent for writing and understanding literature and his tendency to pull away from groups, Charley's advanced English teacher befriends him and encourages him to get involved so that he doesn't spend life on the sidelines for so long that he forgets to live. Because of his teacher's advice, Charley meets his two best friends, Patrick (a homosexual senior) and Sam (the love of his life).  <br /> <br />The book follows Charley through his first year of high school where he encounters drinking, drugs (of all sorts), rape, sexual abuse, physical abuse, abortion, suicide, homosexuality, masturbation, and the value of friends and family. It's a touching novel that shows the darker qualities of human life and looks at the parts of a person's character that is so often hidden. Whether or not you can relate to the main character makes no difference. Wallflower is a novel that will excite, invigorate, and capture readers of all ages and will reach out to all teens in a way that most of us never thought possible. <br />
B00003CXCD|5.0|A princess visiting Rome is taken in for the world's biggest scoop by an American reporter...<br /><br />Off-screen, Peck was so convinced Hepburn would win an Oscar, he insisted she share top billing with him. Unknown before the picture was released, the film indeed made Hepburn an overnight star and netted her the Oscar.  Not only could she act, the camera loved her as it has loved few actresses. Peck and Albert are both terrific, and Wyler's on-location shooting is flavorful and evocative.  This timeless romance is ideal for adults and older children.
B00074DXJE|3.0|Can't believe I'm the first person to review this film... I really don't know what to think.  It's one of those movies that when it is over you think \\"now why didn't I pay more attention the first time.\\"  Without giving the ending away I did wonder about this one character..... Don't think I'd ever watch it again.  Frankly I prefer Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers to this one.  Very gory and hard to follow the story line.  Probably this movie is for viewers under the age of 30 that are used to modern day gore.  Sorry!
B00092ZL80|5.0|I have been so looking forward to seeing this concert.I wasn't disappointed.Chicago and Earth Wind and Fire together is just sublime.Chicago's set was very much like the one they did in Australia 18 months ago so I was happy with that.What I love most about watching this DVD is that everyone on stage from both bands is so joyous and having such a good time.Vocalists from both bands Bill Champlin, Jason Scheff, Philip Bailey, Robert Lamm are all in top form here and the brass sections together and apart are awesome. <br />Ths sound on this DVD is excellent and congrats to all who were there not only because you seemed to be a great crowd but you are a good looking lot too which is helpful. <br />I wish this tour would come to Australia!!!But until then I have this magnificent DVD and you should too!!!
0767817478|3.0|This Movie Was a major Let Down To Us Godzilla Fans. <br /> <br />It Gets 3 stars just because it has a remix of the amazing song brain stew by green day. <br /> <br />
B00097DX3U|2.0|To begin with, I LOVE AUDIOSLAVE!  One of the best live rock bands of the new millenium, as far as I'm concerned.  With that said, I WANT so badly to like this album, but it just seems like my standards have surpassed myself in that regard.    Maybe my expectations were just a tad too high?  Their debut was decent, but nothing amazing (even though there are GREAT songs like, \\"Set It Off\\", \\"Like A Stone\\", \\"Who You Are\\", and \\"I Am the Highway\\").  I figured it was reasonable for their first cd to come off a bit shaky, seeing as how they had very little time to gel as a cohesive unit.  I figured after having been on the road together, they would become tighter as a band, and in a position to feel free to let their best ideas yet come flowing through...    Well, then what happened?  Maybe Rick Rubin was just too busy with his other projects that year (Weezer, System of a Down, Shakira).  Had he been paying more attention to Audioslave in pre-production, he never would've allowed Tom Morello to recycle the riff from \\"Cochise\\", and try to pass it off as a new song.  I have no problem with there being softer songs on the cd, but if a song is going to be mellow, it needs to be EXCITING; to keep the listener's attention (listen to The Beatles or Pink Floyd for some of the most exciting soft-rockers ever), there should be a strong hook to help carry the song.  Chris Cornell has a great voice, but there needs to be a definitive, memorable, melody that people can latch on to.      Another problem that I had with the last album that I noticed is still a problem on this cd:  there needs to be more diversity in the rhythym section.  Almost EVERY song is mid-tempo, 4/4 time signature.  I was hoping they would break out of their comfort zone a little bit, but those moments were sparse, if present at all.  I'm all for simplistic and funky, but there's about a million and a half ways to bring the funk, if only Brad and Tim would take notice.    I do however, love the single, \\"Be Yourself\\".  It's one of the few moments on the cd that doesn't feel contrived, it has a great melody, and it's memorable.  The guitar solo from \\"Man or Animal\\" was quite exciting also, and helped bring my rating up one star as well.    Overall though, the album is very predictable.  There were even a few times on my first listen that I was actually able to predict what the next guitar riff was going to be!  On the other hand, sometimes there needs to be a certain level of playing it safe.  They (the band) may have felt if it ain't broke, to not fix it.    On the next album, I'd love to hear even more experimenation with different keys, LOTS of different grooves (are they totally incapable of playing something really fast?  Just to try to mix it up a bit?), and on the softer songs, not trying to force things too much.  Just be yourself.
B0007Y89ZM|3.0|The visual quality wa great but the voice quality was terrible.  The instruments overpowered the voices which really takes away the whole effect of the harmonizing of the Eagles.  I would not recommend this CD

0374115370|3.0|\\"Which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?\\" (from \\"Vanity Fair\\", W.M. Thackeray, 1848)    In \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\", Tom Wolfe explores the theme of vanity. The exploration is set against an intricate plot in which the lives of upper class and lower class, Wasps and Irish, Jewish and Negros are set on a collision course following a random twist of fate by the book's protagonist -- Sherman McCoy, the aristocratic bond salesman.    But the exploration of vanity is not limited to the rich and wealthy. Wolfe delves into the vanity of the everyman: from the assistant DA absorbed in his physique to the English journalist who is ashamed of how his blazer is becoming \\"shiny\\", even a crack dealer, who goes through 2 pairs of Reeboks a week.     Thakeray explored the same theme in his work \\"Vanity Fair\\". While Thakeray writes in much greater detail and in a more florid style, Wolfe writes in the vernacular, liberally using language to bring to life the myriad of accents of modern day New York. \\"Talking\\" becomes \\"tawkin\\" for the Irish, \\"Sherman\\" becomes \\"Shuhman\\" for the southerners, etc etc.     Bonfire was pure entertainment. I couldn't put it down. On the other hand, it wasn't as satisfying or what I would rate as a \\"masterpiece.\\" Its a pulp fiction version of \\"Vanity Fair\\".

B0009R1T7M|5.0|I've had this album for a couple months or so now (pre-releae copy).  I said back then in May that this was going to be the best album of the year.

B0002OERI0|3.0|Other then 3 songs this album stunk. American Idiot is green Day's best song ever and never gets old. Boulivard of Broken Dreams is a good song with a nice story. St. Jimmy's is a good fast song all around and a very likeable song. This album was Green Day's best but it doesn't say a lot. <br />
6304698690|5.0|This is a well made movie. I watched it years ago and have recently watched it again. It is something worth sharing with your children. I will not drag on about the story line or all the reasons it was great. When you watch it you will understand that I didn't want to spoil it. Even adults can enjoy it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I love Band of Brothers. It is so detailed and full of information. It is so realistic and the story is based on a true story. It is hard to believe that people went through that. If you love WWII and want to see probably one of the greatest WWII movies out there, then you should see this set. It is so great!! You feel the emotions that all the main characters feel. Also before each episode, the surviving soldiers, on which whom the story was based on, talk about what is was like. Then on the last disc, there is an entire episode of the veterans speaking about their experience. This is an awesome series!!

0465011012|5.0|How to review this book? A child is deported to a concentration camp with his family, innocent of any crimes except being related to his grandfather, who is simply accused of an unnamed crime against the state. The grandfather is not held with them, and they receive no news of him. Also they know not for how long their imprisionment will last, or if it will ever end.<br /><br />How the family survives in the gulag of Yodok, how they capture and eat rats for a living, and how their lives continue, after being \\"freed\\" from the gulag.<br /><br />Years after, being suspected of \\"listening to a foreign radio station\\" the author finally leaves North Korea through China, makes his way to South korea, and eventually tells his story.<br /><br />Rivaling anything written about the Holocaust in Europe, this story reminds me of Armando Valladares' \\"Against all hope\\"<br /><br />A must read for anyone interested in foreign relations, and a clear indictment of one of the most heinous of current regimes.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has the voice of an angel in my opinion. Finally breaking out of her \\"good girl\\" shell, she has managed to earn many more people's respect, for her music, and for being herself.

B00080ZG10|2.0|I really looked forward to seeing this film, my expectations were to learn about the life and times of Howard Hughes.  Yes, the cinematics were first class, the special effects were great, but for the average intelligent viewer, if it does not help us understand or develop the main character it is just so much fluff.<br /><br />I admit Decaprio is not among my top 100 actors, but the acting was not enjoyable to watch, maybe the script was thin, but when Decaprio simply barks orders without any foundation of authority it was, well - *painful* to watch.<br /><br />I turned off the video not caring about the man, which is really sad because I am positive there is a really great story there that is worth telling, unfortunately, this time, it just did not happen.<br /><br />PS Yes I did give this DVD to a friend (with a warning) and requested that it not be returned.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|This is another high school basketball team movie exactly like Hoosiers based on true story. Samuel Jackson performs miraculously. Also the games are distributed evenly throughout the movie. Every high school athlete must see this movie for their motivation. There are perfect messages in the film. \\"If you are a champion, act like a champion\\", \\"Success in here is the key to success out there\\", are the most important ones. The story of the movie is inspiring too. Coach Carter (Samuel Jackson) takes the job at ghetto high school. Basketball team was struggling due to undisciplined behaviors. He teaches them how to play and also how to behave. They started to win games but players classes as not good as their court performance. He closes the Gym and suspends the games until they succeeded classes. The only different thing in the movie is ending. They lose the first game at state tournament.

B0006284JQ|2.0|I personally cannot say I'm a true Britney Spears fan. Every now and then, I'll be surprised with a good song, but it's definately not because of her voice, more because of the beats. The only recent song I have liked by her was \\"Toxic,\\" and that, like I said, was because of the beats. It's a great dance song. But then you hear a song like \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"Lucky\\" and it makes you want to gag. With that Alvin and the Chipmunks thing she calls a voice, it is enough to make you wonder why she became famous in the first place. She is definately not a good role model, much less a good singer, and not an impressive dancer at that. On this album, there are only a few songs I like personally, and they are mainly upbeat songs, like \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy,\\" and \\"Toxic,\\" but other than that, this album is nothing to brag about. However, any true Britney fan will be satisfied.
B00000DR8R|5.0|While in the process of moving, I found my old cassette version of Rattlesnakes.  I had bought his \\"best of\\" with the Commotions a few years back, but it had been a while since I listened to the whole album straight through. <br /> <br />I agree with most of the other reveiwers in not understanding why he was never more popular.  I view most song lyrics as insipid, but these are some of the great exceptions. And although I'm a huge fan of 80s music, this transcends that decade and qualifies as timeless great music. <br /> <br />Now I have to dig up my old copies of Mainstream and Easy Pieces
B0007GAERG|4.0|That was the question I had when it came to buying either the new Mariah or the new J. Lo CDs.  So I just went ahead and bought both of them.  And I'm glad I did.  They both have their strong points, but that's not what you want to read, now do you?  <br />I think of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" as a revamped version of \\"Daydream\\".  If you like \\"Daydream\\" and/or \\"Butterfly\\", then you can't go wrong with \\"...Mimi\\".
B000002U82|5.0|Buy this title for yourself, your neighbors, friends, kids,parents,wife..or wives,pets, everyone! This is the greatest record ever..over 200 weeks on the charts shows that other agree with me. BUY IT, steal it if you have to. <br />
0060920084|5.0|This book is hilarious and I am very disappointed in some of the poor reviews I have read. Just because Bill Bryson pokes fun at some aspects of americans doesn't mean he hates america. Who could write a whole about a country they couldn't stand? The guy even moved back to the U.S. after leaving overseas for many years. Get a sense of humor. If you want a boring travelougue that will put you to sleep then go read something else. By the way, read Fark.com daily and you'll see what kind of nuts live here in the U.S. Laughing is the only to dull the pain!
B0000C1733|5.0|I bought this CD after a friend of mine had me listen to some of the Chili Pepper's songs. I have to admit, this CD is amazing. It's got the slow songs (Under the Bridge, Californication, Scar Tissue), along with the high-energy ones (Suck my Kiss, Fortune Faded, Give it Away). Frankly, I haven't found a song I don't like off of this CD. I'd recommend this to any person looking to get into the Red Hot Chili Peppers music. It was well worth buying it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD is awesome.  Thank you PBS for airing the DVD during their fundraising.  That is what got us turned on to it.  I like the Irish feel of some of the songs.  The women singing are very talented as well as the musicians.
B0002858YS|5.0|i heard this album a couple a days before and i just wanna say that this album it's great. i mean, all the songs are pretty cool... specially: \\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"Somebody Told Me\\", \\"All the things that i have done\\", \\"Midnight Show\\", \\"Jenny was a friend of mine\\".<br /><br />in this particular moment i am listining \\"Somebody told me\\" :-)<br /><br />excellent album!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is a great solid effort. Best of You is the most downloaded alternative song on itunes. That's how great this cd is. 1 cd is only acostic, and the other is that rock-alternative. Great songs, I give this a 5 star, because I listen to it everyday. I just walked into my Scotties in my town, and bought it because it was a new album, and I like the Foo Fighters. <br /> <br />Songs that I listen too soo far: <br />Best of You <br />Resolve <br />No Way Back <br />DOA <br />Free Me <br />Miracle <br /> <br />More to listen too soon.. These are a batch of great songs.. When  I bought the cd, they also gave me a record of Best of You.. So, when you buy it, give it a good listen, and enjoy!
B000002MUN|4.0|I'll bet Goeffrey Himes, the Amazon reviewer of this album, doesn't even know how to play a guitar, much less know anything about real music. I didn't know if I should get angry or just laugh at this poor sucker. This album rocks! One of my favorite Tom Petty albums. Buy it. You'll love it. And never mind what little \\"Goeffrey\\" has to say.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|As a kid I loved this tv series. Here was this cool guy who used his brains and the odds and ends he found around him to cook up a way out of some tight spots. Just an average guy trying to get the job done. Watching Macgyver on Friday nights as a kid always proved to be a great adventure. Now you can watch it all again from the beginng. I'll be the first one to say that it's alittle dated, but its still fun to watch with some popcorn and a soda.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|I only loved M&C:TFSOTW.  <br /> <br />The casting is spot on, everyone's acting is right at the top of his game--the only reason this isn't far and away the best film of 2003 is LOTR:ROTK.  Any other year, this film would have been hands down, Best Picture.  Really, just one of the best films of the last 10 years.  <br /> <br /> <br />As good as it is-- <br /> <br />I LOVE THE BONUS DISK MORE! <br /> <br />I usually like 'bonus' material in general, but I must say, I've watched the bonus disk more since I got this than I have the movie.  I especially love the deleted scenes, because what I love about the Aubrey/Maturin saga are the relationships, and every deleted scene is a precious addition to the already strong relationships in the film.  I can see why, for theatrical release, the scenes were cut, but having them available is just priceless. <br /> <br />As are the documentaries.  Most bonus material documentaries are just press material that missed being aired.  This material is truly substantive in terms of discussing the processes that Weir and his team went thru to get a coherent culling of Patrick O'Brian's magnum opus on screen.  <br /> <br />I LOVE the bonus disk.  I think I'll watch it again tonight.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Gerard Butler does a SPECTACULAR job as the phantom of the opera. The only downside to this beautifully done musical is the teenage girl's inevitable hatred of Raul.

B00005JNJT|5.0|This is a serious action film with an arthouse touch. As is well known, it was a majority consensus that the last two film's in the series were cheap parody's of the original comic series, that the caped crusader came dangerously close to becoming the \\"campy crusader\\", lost is some post modern haze. The last instalment (Batman & Robin) with George Clooney as the Batman almost brought Warner Bro's million-dollar Batman industry to a complete standstill. For some strange reason, Batman, even in the hands of capable filmmakers, lost its way, that is, until now.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan as director and co-screenwriter, known otherwise for his \\"thinking\\" films (Memento) has brought his cerebral sensibilities to the project, resurrecting Batman and presenting the character in the true light he deserves.<br /><br />Nolan approached the subject matter with the seriousness that is appropriate to Batman. He is a dark character, bordering on evil, using fear to combat evil. What Nolan has done is to give the audience the necessary background on Bruce Wayne, his seven year sabbatical in the mountains of Tibet, his training with the League of Shadows and his creation of the Batman, returning to Gotham city to fight the forces of evil.<br /><br />What makes Batman unique compared to other superheroes is the fact he does not have super powers but trains himself to do amazing feats, Wayne's incredible will to extend himself towards excellence, in the creation of an ideal, is truly inspiring. As Bruce Wayne has unlimited funds as a billionaire, he is only limited by his imagination, creating the ultimate \\"vigilantly\\", a dark force to be reckoned with in the battle against crime.<br /><br />The film has a league of excellent actors from Morgan Freeman to Gary Oldman playing a young \\"Commissioner Gordon\\"; this would have to be the first \\"good guy\\" that Oldman has played in over twenty years, and as expected, as one of the best character actors in the business, put in a stellar performance.<br /><br />Chris Bale as Batman soars above previous performances in the long series, making the character memorable and inspiring.<br /><br />One cannot write about this film without mentioning the \\"Bat mobile\\"; this car is simply astounding, zooming over the rooftops of the city. What one would give to have that car?<br /><br />I had high expectations for this film before walking into the theatre and found that it exceeded those expectations - without question this is a five star film.stellar performance.  <br /> <br />Chris Bale as Batman soars above previous performances in the long series, making the character memorable and inspiring.  <br /> <br />One cannot write about this film without mentioning the \\"Bat mobile\\"; this car is simply astounding, zooming over the rooftops of the city.

0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is excellent for individuals who may or may not be affiliated with corporations. One the first page, the line \\"good is the enemy of great,\\" is surprising and filled with wisdom. In order to be *great*, we need to find something that we love to do, and CAN excel doing. If we can't be excellent at a task, we should drop it, according to Collins. That makes sense in business.<br /><br />Also, learn to be humble, be a team player and keep the organization's well-being in mind at all times.<br /><br />Chock full of common sense and innovative ideas.

B0006L16N8|2.0|Becuse Radiohead did it better with Ok computer, Which this band is ripping off.......<br /><br />This album was really a letdown
B000077VR3|5.0|Ewan McGregor does an astounding job as the ideal man, a romantic poet intent on having a star prostitute (Nicole Kidman) fall in love with him. It's very original, with brash colors and contrasts to help juxtapose the beautiful romance. My personal favorite touch was the modern pop music in an 1899 French setting. If you want to fall back on a traditional soft-colors romance, look elsewhere. A romantic soul with an open mind will truly appreciate this masterpiece. The only complaint I had with the movie was the \\"Like a Vigin\\" scene, which was stupid and unneeded.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|\\"The Machinist\\" is a film about guilt and innocence; its central character is obsessed with rules and regulations, cleanliness, the proper assignation of responsibility and blame. He says once that \\"a little guilt goes a long way,\\" and we believe him; it seems central to his existence. \\"The Machinist\\" is not an easy film to watch, but it is a very good one. It centers on the emotional unravelling of one man, Trevor Reznik, who is told several times in the movie \\"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.\\" It is not something one needs to be reminded of; Trevor calls to mind the haunted skeletal forms of Holocaust victims. In a way this is fitting; he is the victim of his own private torture, trapped in a world of bleak gray and cold steel-blue. The grief that torments him - and has rendered him sleepless for a year - has literally eaten away at him, body and soul.<br /><br />Trevor is a machinist, a particularly astute one who knows every rule and keeps them all punctiliously. The job and his associates hold little in the way of comfort or pleasure; one senses that Trevor could use quite a lot of both. Once we see him reading, the closest thing to leisure time he seems to afford himself; he is reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's \\"The Idiot,\\" and one wonders if it is an ironic comment on his own existence, a lonely man adrift in a sea of cold hypocrisy. He is not an innocent, as is ultimately revealed, but he is definitely a victim.<br /><br />He has a standing arrangement with Stevie, a hooker who has apparently decided that this broken-down wreck of a man is worth her Heart of Gold. They do have sex - though one worries about him even then; his wraithlike form threatens to break if handled less than delicately - but their connection is more emotional than physical; he turns to her more than once to help him maintain the thin shreds he retains of his sanity. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a subtle and touching performance here, conveying sympathy without condescension and kindness without treacle.<br /><br />He has another engagement, of sorts, with Marie, a kind-hearted waitress at the airport just outside town. He spends every night with her there, going out of his way to see her, drinking coffee and not eating the pie she serves him. She regards him, one senses, with the same sort of tenderness and nurturing that she does her young son. He certainly needs it. Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n, a virtual unknown in the States but deservingly respected elsewhere, gives another of the film's outstanding performances, as a woman kind-hearted but always just slightly intangible.<br /><br />There are several layers of metaphor at work in the film, particularly in the emphasis on \\"left,\\" which carries with it implications of the sinister and ominous. The hangman game progresses right to left; the Other Man in the photo appears on the left. Thrice Trevor encounters a Fork in the Road, and each time the left represents the more dangerous path. It is a small but lovely touch on the part of director Brad Anderson that only the third and final time Trevor is faced with such a choice does he choose the Right.<br /><br />The film's plot consists mostly of psychological games; strange post-it notes that resemble incomplete games of Hangman, a grimly dripping refrigerator, and a menacingly bald and grinning Man in Black are only a few of its elements. In some ways, particularly stylistically, it reminded me of \\"Memento,\\" although \\"The Machinist\\" is not as non-linear as that film. These elements are interesting the first time through, and gain even more meaning the second, when the reason for Trevor's disintegration is understood.<br /><br />And what a disintegration it is. Trevor makes a complete descent into Hell, which for him is the darkness of his own tormented soul. It is made believable by his cadaverous appearance, ghastly skin, eerily bright eyes; he is a man who looks not only as if he has seen Death, but keeps him constant company.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that the usually-buff Christian Bale lost 63 pounds - almost a third of his normal body weight - to play this role. One barely recognizes him here, particularly in contrast to his extremely well-cut physique in films like \\"American Psycho\\" or \\"Batman Begins.\\" Here his every move, every facial expression reveals the movement of bone beneath sallow, paper-thin skin. His clothes hang from his frame. Bale's normally attention-grabbing eyes gain an almost spectral intensity here, as they bulge glittering from their darkened hollows. His appearance is indeed so haggard that even the film's admittedly dramatic punchline almost fails to explain it, and at times it even distracts from the action as one begins to worry about him. Severely. One winces frequently, and I never quite got accustomed to his skeletal presence onscreen.<br /><br />Bale's performance, however, is complex and nuanced, and, like the drastic weight loss, goes far beyond the call of duty. Like his performance in \\"American Psycho\\" (also documenting a man's distancing himself from humanity) Bale here shows no shred of self-preservation, no hint of holding back anything from the role. He not only looks the part but inhabits it, bringing all the weight of his impressive talent to bear. It is this single-minded dedication to the character, and his virtuoso performance, that elevates an otherwise engaging but not mind-blowing psychodrama to a gloomy but impressive work of art.Bale lost 63 pounds - almost a third of his normal body weight - to play this role.

B00000IAU3|4.0|Dido has such a soft and sweet voice and her songs are beautiful. My favorite songs are: Here with me, Hunter, Don't think of me and Thank you. I like all her songs but those 4 songs shine! Dido still isn't as good as Sarah McLachlan because her songs aren't as deep and are very light for me. She still is very good! Go Dido!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007GAERG|4.0|I never expected Mariah to fully recover from the unfortunate flop that was \\"Glitter.\\" But, wow...was I impressed by this amazing successor to the lackluster \\"Charmbracelet.\\"  Here we see Mariah as never seen before.  We forget that even though she became a household name by singing hit adult contemporary-style ballads, she enjoys hip-hop and r&b just as much.  \\"...Mimi\\" gives her freedom to experiment with the hip-hop styles she has been reluctant to do in order to stay on top of the POP charts.  The opening single \\"Its Like That\\" has a catchy chorus and is definately a club song. its fun to listen to in the car with your friends (especially if you have good bass). Another highlight of course is the amazing #1 hit \\"We Belong Together\\" which is really one of her best songs yet. We even had a #1  hit party for WBT at my  best friends house! (and a 200 play count anniversary. LOL). As a fan of her older ballads, I dont really enjoy listening to the ones here (a newer fan may, however). I do however enjoy \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" and \\"Stay The Night\\", in my opinion the strongest ballads on the album.  \\"One And Only\\" has a very urban-feel to it featuring Twista, who tends to sound monotone but still works with the song.  The Neptunes track that stands out the most is \\"Say Something\\" feauturing Snoop Dogg. I love her lower range and I wish she would use it more in her songs. Its sexy (think Toni Braxton). \\"...Mimi\\" may not be her best work (that title belongs to \\"Butterfly\\")...but if you enjoy Mariahs music then purchase this album. Will we ever get to know the REAL Mariah? Probably not. But this is as close to Mimi as we will get.
0140277447|5.0|First, let me say that I'm not an english major so I won't comment on the overall flow and quality of Iris Chang's writing, though I had no trouble with the book.  Second, one can not deny this event happened.  It has been cited, reported, filmed, and documented in so many other ways and in so many other venues that to deny it happened would be like denying Jupiter exists.  That leaves us with a difficult question - How many people did it affect, and how long did it last?  I believe Chang does a good job of outlining what she feels is the potential answer, but she does not force it on the reader.  She also presents other stated observations from the period, giving the reader the option to form their own opinion.  The rough figures range from 2,000 to 350,000 with the general consensus at 150,000-200,000.  I fear we may never know for sure but the bottom line remains, this was a terrible event by any stretch and a repeat for the Japanese.  What I mean by repeat is that throughout WWII (and past conflicts) the Japanese have had a steady track record of unbelievable events.  Burning 150 U.S. POW's to death in the Philipines, using British nurses as bayonet practice in Hong Kong, and one very long list from all over China, just to  name a few.  Don't just read this book and say, \\"Oh wow, that's terrible.\\" or from the other side, \\"That never happened, you can't prove it, this is all lies.\\"  Go out and get all the facts, find out all the angles, then work out the possibilities and determine your own conclusions.  For the record - I believe the number to be above 300,000, but as I stated before, we will simply never know for sure.
B000006V31|3.0|this release has been highly lauded by the \\"stoner\\" rock crowd,but is it any good?? <br />keeping in mind when it was recorded,production techniques being what they where in the early 70's,this isnt at all bad! <br />not a \\"clasic\\" or \\"essental\\" in my book,but well worth a listen and worthy of a place on the collectors shelf. <br />as other reviewers have stated,this is along the lines of Led Zepp and Deep Purple,not so much Black Sabbath (which is what i was after). <br />a solid 3.5 star release

Unlike the earlier three novels, this one builds more on<br /><br />character development and lessons in real life rather than the challenges in detecting the subtle goings on in Gabrone.<br /><br />As always we have the same characters, Manly Maketoni, 97% Makutsi, Christian Charlie and his brother, as always Precious.<br /><br />The novel has two main plots, one around how Makutsi becomes her own boss and the other around how a person repents for his sins done earlier. The character development as always is excellent but repetitive for the reader of the earlier novels. All though, I was shocked by how Ms. Makutsi responded at the end (no spoliers...).<br /><br />A very quick read for the #1 Ladies loyalists and an interesting eye-opener to a new series to the #1 Ladies neophyte.<br /><br />Fred Gabrone Loving Sanford
B00005JN0T|1.0|This movie is terrible.Its just another formulaic piece of hollywood crap. Its a good thing Asimov is dead because he would have died after seeing this horrible movie supposedly based on his novel. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I only gave it one star because you cant give zero stars. The writers,directors,producers,and actors in this movie should be ashamed!!!
B000957O82|3.0|Alright, alright...basically, I liked the movie.  I would not have spent the bucks to see it in a theatre, but both my wife and I enjoyed the DVD. It was moderately funny...but Kevin James' character became the one I wanted to see.  Instead of mining that comedic vein and making it work, the writers thought they could add two other story lines in there.  Didn't work.  The reach of the writers, as they say, exceeded their grasp.  Anyway, I didn't laugh out loud too much, but the idea was a good one.  Also, you can't go too far wrong with Will Smith.  He showed himself to be capable of sophisticated comedy and physical comedy in this movie.  Hollywood needs to write him a movie that allows him to really showcase those talents.
B00005R24K|5.0|I could watch nothing but The Evil Dead for an eternity and never get tired of it.      Yes, this is a low-budget film, and yes, it's filled with unrealistic gore, but the story...the story is one of the best that a horror movie has ever had.  Five friends on vacation in a cabin, they find a tape recorder and a small odd looking book and then release a bunch of demons who immediately possess them, forcing the non-possessed to defend themselves by cutting the possessed to peices.  It's simple, yes, but it's a brilliant concept.    And even though it's unrealistic, I love the gore.  They really made what little money they had strech far.      The Evil Dead is, without a doubt, a horror classic.  Anyone who says they like horror movies probably loves this film.  If they don't...they don't like horror movies.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is the name of this movie AND the lead character depicted on the front.What IS this movie?Well,like 'Seinfield' this is a show about nothing.None of the events have,or are ever designed to have any significant social meaning.It's the story about a painfully mundane small town social outcast Napoleon who lives with his 32 year old brother Kipling,thrill seeking grandmother and is visited by his screwed up uncle Rico.<br /><br />  His school chum is the kind but empty headed Pedro who's actions actually constitute for some of the films better moments.Even Napoleon's various attempts to find a girlfriend.<br /><br />Events such as Pedro's funny wig and bizzare attempt to become class president,as well as Rico's equally eccentric money making scemes produce some funny moments.<br /><br />  Also Kiplings HIGHLY unlikely 'internet girlfriend' Lafawnda and Napoleans highly skillfull dance during Pedro's campaign,in winter boots no less are also great chestnuts.And of course this dance came about due mainly to a 'D Qwuan' dance instruction video purchased at a Goodwill.As you have noticed this is a very offbeat comedy because there is no real point to it all-all the characters are so painfully ordinary and yes-almost boring that their very dullness is what is so humerous.<br /><br />  It's a film made up of very funny moments and even if many of the lead characters (namely Napoleon and Pedro) are certainly not the sharpest tools in the shed they both have big hearts and try to do their best.And if this movie has any point at all it's that no matter how unattractive you or your general demeaner are (such as is the case with Napoleon)that if you try to care about others around you that you will do okay in the end.
B0002OERI0|5.0|The last thing this album needs is a long review, but it by all means deserves one. First off, a warning, this album is not nearly as punk as any of the old Green Day albums.  This is concept album filled with brilliant metaphorical views expressed by great vocals over great music.  Billie's exceptional guitar riffs as well as solos (YES!!!! I DID SAY GUITAR SOLOS!!!!!!) backed up by some rock hard hammering by Tre Cool filled in by edgy, in your fce bassline's of Mike Dirnt.  The Album starts off with \\"American Idiot,\\" a punk, political and guitar happy song which to me sounds like an introduction to one of the greatest albums of all time.  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" has everything you could possibly want in a 9 minute song.  A story along with drum solos, bass solos and guitar solos.  \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken dreams\\" are incredible fillers of the story filled with politics and emotion.  \\"Are we the Waiting\\" is a drum filled song with amazing vocals and emotional lyrics.  Once again the album is linked to the story.  \\"St. Jimmy\\" is the introduction of a new character, none other than St. Jimmy.  An in your face and pissed off in general song gets you back in a Green Day mode after the slow \\"Are We The Waiting.\\"  \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" is yet another emotional song with a great riff and drums.  \\"Shes A Rebel\\" is a lot like \\"St. Jimmy\\" in the musical aspect, however this introduces the Character of Whatsername.  Another fast song after a slow one.  \\"Extraorinary Girl\\" is amazing.  The drums are incredible and its upbeat rythem gets your feet tapping and just makes you happy.  Then comes \\"Letterbomb\\".  Easily, my favorite song on the entire album.  It sounds almost like an explosion of anger and hatred but with great music behind it. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is the most emotional song Billie Joe has ever written.  I'm not gonna give anything about this song away though because its just too good.  \\"Homecoming\\" is another 9 minute song but I like this one better.  Filled with new Green Day emotion and classic Green Day comedy, this is an amazing song, and a huge turn in the story.  \\"Whatsername\\" starts off slow but turns upbeat and inspitational towards the end of the song.  A brilliant conclusion to a brilliant album.  Well I probably could have saved a lot of time just by saying this album is awesome so buy it but thats ok.
B0006L16N8|3.0|So much hype...it really is hard to live up to THAT much anticipation.  Perhaps that is why I'm giving this album only 3 stars. Coldplay is one of the greatest bands around now and try to prove it on this mid-tempo rock album. Here's a run-down of the tracks: <br />01-Square One <br />Sounding a bit U2-ish with the guitars here... <br />02-What If <br />Pulling at the heartstrings, Coldplay at their best <br />03-White Shadows <br />Hmmm..another U2 song???  Where's Bono? <br />04-Fix You <br />Every Coldplay album has that one standout song...Parachutes had \\"Trouble\\", Rush Of Blood... had \\"The Scientist\\", and now \\"Fix You.\\"  Goosebumps from the first note...AMAZING! <br />05-Talk <br />One word: monatonous. <br />06-X&Y <br />If you slow down \\"Yellow\\", and play it backwards, this is probably what you'd end up with. <br />07-Speed Of Sound <br />Coldplay covering...Coldplay?!?  aka \\"Clocks, Part 2\\" <br />08-A Message <br />Great song to remind us why we liked the band in the first place <br />09-Low <br />That whole monatony thing again... <br />10-The Hardest Part <br />...and again... <br />11-Swallowed In the Sea <br />Coldplay meets Radiohead = excellent. <br />12-Twisted Logic <br />Why isnt this called \\"Backwards & Forward?\\"  Good beat though. <br />13-Til Kingdom Come <br />My guess is that they saved this as a hidden track to reward those who listen to the album in its entirity.  And it pays off, second best song after \\"Fix You\\". <br /> <br />I'd definately suggest this album to the Coldplay fan, but if you're a first time fan, check out Rush Of Blood To the Head first. <br />
B0001611DI|5.0|George A. Romero really knows how to put a message in a movie.  As many other reviewers have said, Dawn of the Dead is not just a horror movie, but a satire of American materialism during the late 70s.    But let's skip that, as I don't know anything about the 70s.    This, as so many other people have said, is an excellent movie.  It is far better than the previous Dead movie, Night of the Living Dead, which was an excellent movie as well.  The entire movie has a terrifyingly Apocalyptic feel to it, which really adds a lot to what the movie's all about.      Now, I wasn't alive in the 1970s, but I'm damn sure the gore in this movie disturbed a good many people.    One thing I really admired about this movie is how accurately humans would probably behave in a situation like this.  That alone made the movie feel real.    There's nothing wrong with the movie, but the DVD extras arn't much to get excited about.  Trailers, TV and radio spots...no deleted scenes or anything.  Ah well.    The extras really don't make a difference because this is still one of the best horror films ever made, hands down.
B0000DBJDL|4.0|Pink Floyd at Pompeii is an excellent document to a long lost era of one of the best bands ever, but most of you know this already. Like alot of people, the directors cut took a bit getting used to as I've owned the vhs for almost 20 years now.  However, I really believe some of the added parts are superior to the original. The added scenes usually take the place of the full band shots that occur during certain songs. These shots are of all of the band members and they look awkwardly close together and the whole shot just doesn't seem right. For example, in the original version during Saucerful of Secrets during the Celestial Voices segment the original would cut to all four band members playing. The problem is, it looks completely weird, Gilmour's hair is blowing from the wind and is covering his face when he sings in closeups , yet when it cuts to the group shot it's pefectly still. I could be mistaken here, but he also seems to be lip syncing in these \\"group shots\\" Another example, during Careful with the Axe, Eugene on the original group shot, Rick Wright appears to beardless, even though he has a beard the rest of the time. Now maybe he shaved during the recording of these shows or my eyesight really IS failing me, but these shots simply didn't work. It's hard to explain unless you've seen it but it looks really hokey and it happens during most of the songs. I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned this and I'm *glad* they replaced those parts. There are however, still parts where shots of pompeii and various pompeii artwork have inexplicably been replaced with inferior computer art and shots of abbey road. The ability to watch the original 60 min film is very nice, I just wish they made this a 2 dvd set and included the vhs film as well. Regardless, the interview segments in the directors cut have been  expanded over the vhs version and are really cool to watch. The studio footage is pretty good to watch as well but would have been better left as an extra,as some people have already stated. Despite these minor shortcomings, this is a very well done movie. The directors cut seems to get a bad rap from alot of folks. But the option to watch the original makes this worth the money in and of itself.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Ok, so the new Coldplay cd is out, \\"X & Y,\\" and it is doing very good. The reviews are good, and it is topping the charts. I think all the hype over this album is a bit unnecessary. I got the album the day it came out because I pre-ordered it off of iTunes. This is probably one of the most anticipated albums for myself. I was expecting something amazing, because we are all familiar with \\"Parachutes,\\" and \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head.\\" After listening to the album numerous times, I would have to say it is quite the disappointment. The album is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not \\"Coldplay good.\\" This band is capable of so much better. A lot of the songs seem to be just the same music with one or two notes changed. This is more frustrating because the first single, \\"Speed Of Sound,\\" is very good, in my opinion. They put out the impression that the whole album would be like that, but that song is one of the best on the cd. I don't know what got into Coldplay. \\"Parachutes\\" is my favorite Coldplay cd, and these two cds are nothing alike. This is a bit unfair, because I am comparing this cd with a classic, but if Coldplay is going to try and become one of the best bands in this time, they are going to have to do some better stuff. I think a lot of Coldplay fans are in denial about this album. I have talked to many, and their reaction is \\"Oh, it's the best.\\" Then I ask them what is good about it, and the freeze. All this hype over the album is wrong. This album os getting so much attention only because it is Coldplay's first studio album in three years. For once, I agree with Rolling Stone Magazine. This album is not what people are making it out to be. I will give some credit, however. There are about four or five great songs, and if the all were like these, this album would be absolutely amazing. \\"Speed Of Sound,\\" \\"Fix You,\\" \\"What If,\\" \\"'Till Kingdom Comes,\\" and \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" are the best songs on the album, in my opinion. Those songs cannot make this album great, because the others don't live up to them. I would listen to this album if I had to. Hey, I am listening to it now. The album is good. It's just not as good as what people are saying. If you are a new Coldplay fan, don't let this cd fool you. They are a great band. I just hope their next albums are a bit more creative.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I will admit, I was first illuminated to the greatness of Rock around two years ago when I started to enjoy some Led Zeppelin tunes, and I have been exploring all of the available rock, classic and modern, music since.  Around three months ago I stumbled upon Rage Against the Machine, a band that delivered incredible Guitar licks along with a solid band and great vocals.  I was disappointed to find out Zack had left the group, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover the rest of the band had joined with Chris Cornell to form the super group Audioslave.  I listened to the first album with great pleasure, hoping they would be able to churn out some more great head banging hits and beautiful ballads in their second album.  Little did I know how extraordinary this band was.      Out of Exile is an album that defines great rock and roll.  It doesn't just produce songs that do the same in each song, and stick to one solid formula to please the fans.  \\"Your Time Has Come\\" and \\"Out of Exile\\" reminds us of the classic RATM formula and issues a great riff to support it, while \\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind me\\" are denser, uplifting songs sounding like sugar to the ears.  \\"Dandelion\\", my favorite song on the album, illuminates the fact that this band is far from a conversion of two bands.  It is a mixture that has created a whole new band, one that is unique and well up to the task of  creating great music.  This album is full of hits and is a sure buy if you are in any way a fan of rock and roll, let it be bluesy Led Zeppelin, Hard Soundgarden, or Riff heavy RATM.  But in order for you to understand fully the greatness of this album, I'll break down each individual song for a better understanding of the album:    Your Time Has Come - A great way to start an album.  Morello churns out another great lick, while the band forms around him.  92/100    Out of Exile - one of the best riffs of the album, one that was probably ready for the next RATM album, but Audioslave found away to make it into their own unique song.  91/100    Be Yourself - You'll be singing this song for days.  A great upbeat song, with a great solo by the magician Tom Morello. 95/100    Doesn't Remind Me - A close third, the only problem with this song is its bridge.  The bridge sounds as if the band needed to have a bridge in the song and this was the best they could come up with.  Just like \\"Be Yourself\\", this song stays away from the   \\"forming around a riff\\" and follows it's own \\"Audioslave\\" style 97/100     Drown Me Slowly - After the intro, there is never a dull moment.  A good song, but not a great one.  80/100    Heaven's Dead - Many love this song, but I prefer the ballads on Audioslave's first album to this one.  It just doesn't do much for me.  70/100    The Worm - A great riff to start and great guitar throughout, but a little too screechy solo by Tommy lowers the score 87/100    Man or Animal - A great Riff and fast paced.  not much else to say 90/100    Yesterday To Tomorrow - I am in love with the riff in this song.  The song itself doesn't really do that much, but the riff during the chorus sounds so well put together and flows so perfectly.  If the other parts were as incredible as the chorus, it would be a perfect score.  88/100    Dandelion - My favorite song on the album.  Such a great uplifting and beautiful song.  Just listen to it and you will be caught.  Hats off to you Audioslave. 100/100        Number 1 Zero - My second favorite song on the album.  It reminds me of a classic Zeppelin tune \\"Bring it on Home\\" since it starts off slowly and soundly until it breaks off suddenly into uncalled-for heavy riff that you can't resist head-banging to. I only wish the middle section lasted longer.  98/100     The Curse - The worst song on the album, since it doesn't really go anywhere, while sounding in it's own sense like the last song of an album.  But since when does an incredible album have to have 12 great songs on it? 65/100    983/1200 = 81.92Number of 85+ songs (Hits) = 9  Average score of Hits = 93.1    You might look at the 81.92 and think, \\"ugh that's not very good\\".  But the Hit average is incredibly high for 9 songs.  And considering that there has never been an album that has had hit songs for every single song on a 10+ track cd, this is an amazing score.  Therefore, it is apparent that Audioslave has definitely made a name for itself with this sophomore album.  It presents many different forms of rock and does it beautifully, generating many hits for years to come.  If you have any liking in Rock and have not had the chance to experience this album yet, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.     ~Nick
B00005JNNZ|4.0|Based on events both real and recent, this story of the difference a commitment to standards and goals can make is both inspirational and instructive.  Ken Carter was an All-American basketball star at Richmond High School in the early 1970s.  He had personal experience with the grinding poverty, broken homes, and inadequate education these students faced.  He was a businessman rather than a teacher when he took over the basketball team.<br /><br />Because he wanted them to find a better path in life than the one put in front of them, he had each of the players sign a player contract.  The player signed, the parent(s) signed it, and the coach signed it.  It asked for a higher GPA than required by the school board.  When he explains why he wanted a 2.3 than the 2.0 required is, I think, one of the great moments in the film.  Simply, those few higher GPA points would mean that a player could get be eligible to play in an NCAA program with a lower SAT score.  So, it increased the likelihood that they could go to college.  It wasn't an empty gesture, it was to make the path to college and a better life more available to his student-athletes.<br /><br />Coach Carter became a national sensation when he found that some of his players were not hold up the end of their academic commitment.  He locked the gym and forfeited games.  The idea being that they were a team and they succeeded or failed as a team.  I think this nobility of no one being left behind is fabulous.  However, many in Richmond went ballistic and the Coach decided to quit rather than relent.  What follows is the climax of the film.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson does a fabulous job and the portions of the game shown are done very well.  I like the way that they show whole plays rather than a bunch of quick cuts pretending to be plays.  It was also nice that they kept it looking like high school ball rather than college ball or pro-ball.  And they use the shots of training and the games to illustrate and support the undergirding points of the film.<br /><br />The players all do a fine job.  They have very difficult personal lives and while Coach Carter is very tough and some would say harsh, those that stayed on the team rose to the occasion and were better for it.  In an accompanying feature showing the real Coach Carter and the real players, one of the players seems to still be quite full of himself and still not understand what the coach was trying to do for him, but what can you do?  Sometimes water can't get to the inside of a rock.<br /><br />The extras are nice including deleted scenes.  This is a great movie to watch with your kids and talk about what is going on and why you hold the values you do.  There is much rough language, some sensuality and violence, and one story element of a pregnancy that ends with an abortion with adoption never coming up in the discussion.  But this was real life and choices made by real people in life circumstances most of us will never know.  We can learn from this story and be inspired by what Coach Carter and his athletes did and learned in that 1999 season.nts of the film.     The players all do a fine job.

B0006L16N8|3.0|\\"X&Y\\" is not that bad. However, it definitely is not as good as Rush of Blood to the Head, hands down.. For me, it just doesn't hold the same dynamics and emotion as Rush of Blood, which was why i thought it was great. <br />I think I'd rate this album 4 stars, except for the fact that one aspect unapologetically reached out and slapped me in the face, as if I didn't know any better, or wasn't very smart.. That aspect being the song \\"X&Y.\\" The latter part of the song is good; i like it.. However, lets be real people - the little atmospheric guitar solo in the middle of the song is a blatant rip of Radiohead's song \\"Airbag.\\" Anyone remember OK Computer??? Yeah. It should be written in the rock n roll rule book that no one can sample off that album ever again. Thom Yorke is more than likely chuckling somewhere. <br />Pretty good effort by Coldplay...I fear Chris Martin's voice is getting too big for the band <br />3 Stars. Nobody does Radiohead better than......Radiohead.
0679412719|5.0|There are several things that make this book so special.  It is written by a Roman Emperor and is a book of introspective philosophy rather than a publication of his public acts or justifications for his career.  Although it was written in the Christian era, it is clearly a non-Christian work and that makes it very interesting as well.  One of the problems we have understanding such a work is that our culture, though largely post-Christian nowadays, is rooted in and permeated by Christian concepts and institutions.  Be careful as you read this book to not let your present-day mindset fool you into thinking you understand what this mind from a different world of almost 2,000 years ago wrote.<br /><br />The book is arranged in chapters - what we would call paragraphs.  And books - that we would call chapters.  They were written at different times and not meant to be a coherent statement of the author's beliefs.  Often, they seem to be advice to himself.<br /><br />About one-half of this book is notes to help the reader understand what Marcus Aurelius wrote.  This is quite necessary, because it is so easy to get off on the wrong track by misreading what is actually being said in this austere and often quite strange book.<br /><br />Yet, it has a nice payoff in helping the reader see the world a bit differently and to bring that portion of the history of the Roman Empire to life.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|There are so few books, movies, and products that just really light a fire under my, well, you know where region.  The movie COLD MOUNTAIN was one such thing.  The novel THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD was another such item.  And now I found yet another----BIG FISH.  Supported by a smart script , it faces the bitter relationship between father and son. The father to my mind represents the same Burton, where imagination and reality are blended, so the limits between what's the official story and what was dreamed is difficult to define.  True, this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, but nevertheless it is a sweet story, and makes you think about yourself and other people in your life, as it is also a true classic motion picture event. The acting is absolutely superb as it is always the case with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor does a great job too. The scenery is beautiful and the photography is exceptional, and sure you will find some of Tim Burton's trademark shocking or even somewhat scary moments, but always the humorous relief.
6305609705|4.0|I give Apocalypse Now only 4 stars because the original has commentary, while Redux includes additional footage. When will they package a single collector's edition DVD with both versions plus commentary plus other extras (another reviewer discussed scenes where Willard has to fight additional guards)??? I would buy it the first day out!!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I watched this movie last night and I have to say that it rose far above my expectations.  I expected a lot because of all the hype, but I didn't expect this much.  First off I want to say that Jamie Foxx is somewhat of a hidden trick, I mean, this guy has been around for almost ever and he all of a sudden comanded your attention.  It's almost like he woke up last year and said \\"dang, I really need to do something great\\" and so he did, with this movie.  My favorite part for Foxx is when his charactor meets with some thugs.  You can see this is the point in the movie when he really BECOMES his charactor.  Anyways, I wanted to say that, and then again I feel I need to point out that Tom Cruise was brilliant.  I really don't like him much at all, I mean, I was saying this the other day to my wife, but Tom Cruise is annoying in person and he's really not that great of an actor but he always picks the BEST movies...My attitude has changed after seeing this movie.  He may still be annoying, but he can act.  So heres the 411...Max (Foxx)is an LA taxi-cab driver who, as you will see, never reaches hard enough for his dreams.  He's living the same routine he live's everyday, scared of change, scared of anything that may be different.  He picks up a woman (Jada), a lawyer working on a big case and he gives her his philosiphy, that you need to take mini breaks, mini vacations throughout the day and he does this by looking at a postcard of an island.  This is important, because the heart of this movie is so much more than a hitman and a cabbie.  Anyways, he says she needs the break more than he does and he gives her the photo.  In return she gives him her number...so now he keeps that in the spot saved for his photo.  SO out gets the girl and in gets the killer.  Vincent (Cruise) has 5 stops to make and offers Max $700 to take him for the night.  He reluctantly agrees (although it would break routine) and he ends up in for the ride of his life.  There are plot twists and turns,especially come the last thirty minutes or so, and the last ten minutes will have your heart beating through your chest.  Heres what I love so much about this movie, because without the underlining moral of this story it would just be a movie, but it's so much more than that.  Max lives life with no purpose, no excitment because he so afraid of anything different.  Vincent is the exact opposite.  He lives for the moment.  Theres a scene in the movie when Vincent is telling Max that one day he will wake up and realive that his dream never happened.  Case in point, Max's dream is to own his own Limo company 'Island Limos' and he tells everyone that taxi-driving is only temp. that he's saving up for his dream, getting things in order...the reality of it all is he been driving for twelve years...that's Vincent's point...he's had this dream for so long it's almost passed, almost gone and soon it will be too late.  There's a balance between two completly different life-styles or attitudes that needs to be met.  Your life should have some order, but not so much that you rule out the unexpected, you rule out the best parts of life because your not ready for them.  The fact of the mater is Vincent was the best thing that ever happened to Max!
B0000033P0|5.0|ELP heads into uncharted territory on Tarkus, pushing the limits of music that a trio might aspire to (as opposed to achieve, where Cream still reigned supreme). What it all means is anyone's guess, and it may be nothing more than a mosaic of highfalutin' instrumental workouts and pretentious pronouncements. Remarkably, none of that's really important. What is important is the faith that the music inspires in its musicians and, by extension, its audience. You get the sense that ELP approached Tarkus as their magnum opus (until the next magnum opus, anyway), and it's this spirit of elevated creativity that fuels Tarkus. The side-long \\"Tarkus\\" starts with a clear beginning, in the spirit of creation with a single sound that soon explodes into life, and from there the band fuses Emerson's instrumental passages (often held together by improvisation) with Lake's songs (not far removed from his work with King Crimson). The arrangements themselves are at best bone and sinew, Emerson's piano providing the color against Palmer's superlative, dry drumming and Lake's incidental bass lines. When the band does reach sublime heights, it's often on the strength of Lake's stalwart voice, resolute in a maelstrom of sound.  <br /> <br />The second side seeks to defuse the pomposity of the previous saga with the irreverent \\"Jeremy Bender,\\" to be savored as a cherished oddity. \\"Bitches Crystal\\" returns to the haunting grounds of side one, and remains a favorite among fans. What follows next is a miniature epic: \\"The Only Way\\" (which questions God) and the instrumental \\"Infinite Space,\\" which follows a more structured and restrained path than the explosive moments around it (they would revisit this style on songs like \\"Jerusalem,\\" perhaps the remnant of some fiery country parson still in their blood). The wonderful \\"A Time And A Place\\" (file under epic) and \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\" (which immortalizes engineer Eddy Offord) close the album, every ounce of energy drained. By turns funny, profound and profane, Tarkus marks the arrival of greatness in the annals of ELP. That it's a self-proclaimed greatness seized by the sheer will of youth, and not the hoary crown passed down by the unclean fingers of doddering critics, no doubt hastened the band's downfall to its current, unenviable state of disrepute. <br /> <br />Tarkus is a reminder that ELP walked tall at a time when censorious hands had yet to stick a knife in their back. A highly recommended record for all prog fans and for all newcomers to Emerson Lake and Palmer. <br /> <br />Enjoy the music! <br />-Andrew
B000001F29|5.0|I have lost count how many times I have purchased this CD. I lend then to others and never see them again. It great.
B000002504|5.0|Octopus is a fitting title, since the band is playing here like they've got extra arms. I have yet to hear any GG album so skillfully wrought as Octopus; if you're approaching the band from the outside, this is definitely the right appetizer. When describing the band's music, words like \\"medieval,\\" \\"madrigal,\\" \\"complex\\" and \\"counterpoint\\" usually find their way into the text, and all of them would apply here. <br /> <br />But the album's real achievement is delivering all of these qualities in a remarkably soft sell. They're not out to dazzle you, their genius is simply a natural outcropping of the individuals involved. \\"The Advent of Panurge\\" sets the stage for this, introducing all manner of music in as natural and organic a setting as possible so that listeners don't gag on the amount of substance crammed into a single song. Elsewhere, the humorously bleak \\"A Cry For Everyone\\" (which seems to poke a little fun at brooding acts like Black Sabbath and Jethro Tull) and playful experiments like \\"Knots\\" and \\"Dog's Life\\" reveal a band maintaining a sense of humor in a genre (prog rock) known for being self-consciously serious. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention how good Derek Shulman's voice sounds on this record; Derek can sometimes come across as an acquired taste, but he's as smooth as butter on Octopus. New drummer John Weathers also adds some wonderful touches, like the xylophone solo on \\"Knots.\\" Coming on the heels of having listened to Genesis' Trespass, I'm reminded of how the word \\"sublime\\" is overused in musical criticism. To call Octopus \\"sublime\\" is perhaps to miss the point, since the band works hard to keep their heavenly arrangements earthbound. This is quintessential Gentle Giant, inspired at every turn, their sticky genius on display from any angle.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Not having read the book, i bought this on DVD and watched it for the first time. I must say i'm blown away by 3 things about it. First, Christian Bale's acting is superb. Some of the best acting i've seen in a while as a matter of fact. Second, the movie is highly entertaining with not one part of it being boring. As soon as it starts, you're sucked into the movie's reality and you really don't want to 'get out', for want of a better term. And finally, Three, i'm amazed at why it's taken me so long to get around to seeing this. I always thought it was just another \\"Slasher\\" kind of film. I didn't really have any motivation for seeing it until now, and it's really paid off. <br /> <br />Like i said, as soon as this movie starts, you're sucked into it's reality. It's set in 1987, and it's such a movie in that you actually do start to wonder if it WAS made in 1987. The hairstyles, the clothes, the phones, the cars..everything makes it look like the late 80's. And of course, Cocaine is the drug of choice, and Hookers are used and abused frequently by all the Yuppies in town as well. And in the middle of all that, we have our main character Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale. As i said, the acting is extremely good. Bale is pretty much THE perfect choice for the role. <br /> <br />One of the highlights of the movie, and i stress the \\"One of..\\" part of that, is the ending. I really don't know how to explain it without giving away the ending, but i must say the ending is truly awesome. This movie is dark, violent and altogether very cold. It does have that cold atmosphere about it. After watching this movie too, i really want to check out the book. I've heard it's pretty much word-for-word and almost exactly the same, except more violent, but i still think it'd be very interesting. Also, that's not to say this movie isn't 'violent' either, because it really is in some parts. There is one part where Christian Bale is running naked down the hallway, chainsaw in hand,covered in blood, trying to murder a Hooker. So it is pretty violent in some parts, and basically the whole movie has a dark and violent atmosphere behind it. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed Donnie Darko, Fight Club or even The Shining, you will no doubt enjoy this great movie. It won't leave you feeling uplifted and happy, but nor should it. It's not that type of movie and isn't trying to be, obviously. In a word it's unsettling, as the title of my review says. I highly recommend it, if you have or have not read the book. Definitely a 5/5.
0316168815|4.0|I really enjoyed this book so much that I ran out and bought Alice Sebold's memoir Lucky.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones took me two days to read, and although I was a bit disappointed in the ending, I would still recommend it to anybody.<br /><br />Take a chance! You'll enjoy this one!
B00028HBKC|5.0|'Passion of the Christ' does justice finally to the life and character of Jesus Christ on film. It's been a long time coming, with the reality of the brutality of the Crucifixion. I loved how they show cinema vision in various parts like a tear coming from Heaven at Golgotha. Haven't seen a film this good since the '10 Commandments'.
0553573403|5.0|I don't like getting long with reviews.  To make it simple, within fantasy, the only books that I would rank higher than this one are books 2 and 3 of the series.  How many fantasy authors do you know who's monstrous 1000 page books actually get better.  Goodkind never topped his first novel and crumbled after book three in my mind...and Jordan didn't do all THAT much better.<br /><br />This man is brilliant and I'm dying for the rest of the series (which is my only complaint...he puts quite a few years in between his releases)
B000005JA8|5.0|After reading only the 1-star reviews, I think I like this album more than I did before. The fact that those reviewers assume that this MUST be some sort of terrible inside joke played upon the masses by an arsty elite is pretty hilarious, and just shows the ultimate ignorance and irrational fear of something different and uncomfortable from stubborn, angry. Why would so many people even consider this as a great album if it were so utterly unlistenable and terrible? There's no answer to that question, because there is no reason to a statement like that.    That's not to say the album is the best thing that's ever happened to music - there's plenty of filler here. The little bits of dialogue in between some of the songs doesn't exactly add a whole lot of depth to the album, but just imagine if it didn't have the \\"A squid eating dough...\\" or \\"that's right, the masacra snake\\" in it. It would definitely be nowhere near as fun to listen to, because those bits really lighten up the heavy compositions. Then, of course, we have \\"The dust blows forward...\\", \\"well\\", and \\"orange claw hammer\\", where it can be more than frustrating hearing the Captain mumble and stumble over howled nonsensical stream-of-conciousness lyrics. Still, after listening to the album more I find them more funny than anything else - I really doubt that they were meant to be anything but intentionally over the top spoofs of old blues/soul. Then again, it's never easy to tell with the Captain. Finally there's stuff like \\"my china pig\\" and \\"the blimp\\", both of which don't really seem to fit with the rest of the album but are entertaining enough to where it doesn't really matter.    And that's how I'd respond to any of the album's detractors saying that it's padded with too much excess junk or Zappa messed the album up or that \\"lick my decals off, baby\\" is better and more refined (which I'm inclined to agree with) - it doesn't matter. Even when the parts repeat like mad (like that eternal riff in \\"when big joan sets up\\"), they're still mindblowing and not tiresome. This is certainly a timeless, eye-opening experience, and something that shows the untapped potential of rock music and music in general. In a way, I'd almost say the album is a joke. It's a joke on anyone who professes to take music so seriously that they'd have a violent adverse reaction to something so nonsensical and goofy. First, you need to throw any serious attachment you have to traditional music and be able to open up your mind enough to percieve that everything really is one big joke and while you may be really emotionally attached to your \\"led zeppellen\\" albums, there is a realm beyond that where everything you took so seriously hollows out and the Captain is left laughing and howling nonsensically about orioles singing like oranges to anyone who will listen.
0312958455|5.0|In today's politically correct, Prozac, downsized temp-worker world one has to wonder how a detective like Harry Bosch, that is, irascible, blunt, and contemptuous of administrators, can even be employed in a police department. Fortunately for the citizens of LA he is. But in The Last Coyote, Harry has pushed his effete lieutenant's head through a window for interfering with one of his cases. Of course, immediate suspension follows with mandatory counseling.<br /><br />Harry now has time to consider himself and his life - what should he be doing. He is forced to confront some of those issues with his counselor with whom he is at first defiant, but later grudgingly accepts. Foremost is that his mother's murder left him alone some thirty years before. He has been psychologically unable to look into his mother's death, but now that becomes his mission. Not even the counselor can dissuade him. Harry has to grapple not only with his emotions as he becomes aware of the involvement of others in the death, but also with the leaving of his long-time girlfriend and the meeting of another girl who has her own issues.<br /><br />The story is well constructed, flows well, and is interesting. Harry slowly gets to the bottom of his mother's death. The ending is unexpected, but not illogical. The book is definitely a very good read.
B000059LGC|4.0|Like many other reviewers, I have a deep affection for the character of hercule poirot and am quick to point out any inconsistencies between the actor portraying him and my own vision of him.  Death on the Nile is the first movie in which I saw peter ustinov in the role (other christie productions with him as poirot pale incredibly in comparison to this one).  At first I thought he was terribly miscast, mainly because he didn't look the part and his \\"belgian\\" accent was so phony. However, after seeing this movie a few times, his performance has grown on me; he adds much needed playful humor to the movie which I think is present in much of Christie's books, but many times lost in the movie/tv versions, especially those with David Suchet (who is much too serious for my taste).  I think ustinov plays well the whole \\"papa poirot\\" side of the character.  Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith and the other big names did a pretty good job, but I think the Egyptian landscape was the real star of this production, and, of course, the incredibly clever twisting plot.  I'm giving four stars because this is one of the more well made christie productions; my favorite is murder on the orient express with albert finney, who, down to the limp (a war injury mentioned in the mysterious affair at styles), was, in my mind, a nearly perfect poirot.
6305907145|1.0|If it were possible, I think Jane Austen should rise from her grave and hunt down Patricia Rozema.  Why would anyone think they could improve Jane Austen by \\"adapting\\", read hacking, her work to bits?  While I'm not a big fan of the BBC version, it's a lot better than this tacky movie.  At least the BBC writer seemed to have read the book, and understood the writer. <br /> <br />Buy the book and give a real writer a chance to tell a tale.  This movie belongs in the trash.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I have NEVER liked Tom Cruise. Even before this latest stunt with Katie Holmes, I have never been a fan. I can barely stomach my boys love of Top Gun and Days of Thunder. That being said, I love this movie. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful fairy tale about innocence lost. It has all of the elements of a fairy tale, magic, wonder, a princess, a hero, a band of merry makers, a villain, danger, intrigue, suspense, laughter and ofcourse a Happy Ever After ending. <br /> <br />This movie was made in 1985 and holds up very well today. My mother bought it for me as a child because of my love on Unicorns and I bought it for my children because of the wonderful story. Tom Cruise, Robert Picardo and Tim Curry are almost unrecognizable in their roles, Tom because of his age, Tim and Robert due to the make up. Mia Sara is amazing in her role as the princess of both Dark and Light. Classic actor Billy Barty is highlighted here as well. <br /> <br />One of the amazing facts about this movie is that it was filmed entirely on a sound stage. The sets are so inspiring, you must see them to believe them, and you wont believe its not real. Check out the special features on the DVD for more about the soundstage and the real plants and animals that were used in filming. <br /> <br />This is a story worth seeing, worth showing to your children. Its a classic Good versus Evil story and has moments of scary themes and a small touch of violence (no blood). The only movie one could remotely compare this to is Labyrinth, and this is the far superior movie. Please check it out.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|The book was so much better than this movie.  I was terribly disappointed with the scriptwriting and casting of this movie.  The writer/director cast British and Australians for the best roles of this movie (remember Gone With The Wind and it's Irish and British cast?).  Only one true Southerner had a role.  Pity.  I laughed when the actors kept losing their accent, then resuming it again in another scene, especially the goat lady. <br />Nicole Kidman does make a convincing fish out of water character, and only those folks who've read the book can appreciate her performance. <br /> <br />Besides too many foriegn and nonSouthern actors, I found it troubling that US extras lost out to Romanian soldiers.  Sure it costs more to shoot in the US, but North Carolina should look like North Carolina. <br /> <br />I watched the \\"making of\\" included in the dvd, and found it was too talky, and too much of the director. <br /> <br />The music soundtrack is a keeper, especially if you're into old timey music such as banjo frailing, and more.  Anyone who's spent time in the Deep South and learned much of the area's music would have run across sacred harp music.  It's powerful, and might take a while to appreciate for most people. <br /> <br />So buy the book here, buy the soundtrack, and see the movie.  Listen to the soundtrack while you read the book, and see if it doesn't sweep you along.
1400049628|5.0|There's not much to say about this book other than the fact that it is hilarious and the illustrations are comical as well.  I can't believe some of the nerds reviewing this book and giving it low marks as if the subject was as ultra-serious as a wilderness survival guide or something like that.  Plain and simple, this book rocks and is funny as hell...
B0009R1T7M|5.0|In case the title of this review isn't clear enough, i'll expand.<br /><br />I've been a fairly avid fan of Sufjan since his other 50 States Project album, Michigan. But Illinois blows his previous work way out of the water. He manages to combine the sound of impressively sophisticated fully orchestral scores with the non-pretentious and soft folksy sound we love so much about our dear Sufjan.<br /><br />Buy the dang Cd you know you want to.
B00031TXBI|5.0|Inside of Emptiness is my favorite of his 6 album/6 month releases. \\"Look On\\" is without a doubt the best song on the album. The lyrics are incredible, and tell the story of his life shortly before he got off heroin, and topped with a two minute guitar solo. Omar Rodriguez does a great job on \\"666\\" on the guitar, and Josh's drum line on \\"Emptiness\\" is the best drumming I have heard out of him. Everyone should buy this album, whether or not they like him, because it is a super album in every aspect.
0380789035|2.0|After reading and liking Neil Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere,\\" I was looking forward to reading this book, deciding to wait until the paperback came out.  I finally picked up a copy about a week ago and dove in.<br /><br />The first few pages were a good read, but at this point, I can't even finish it.  And I'm the type of person who likes to slog through, no matter what.<br /><br />But I couldn't with this book.  Why?<br /><br />I thought about it, and my main complaint is that I don't care about the characters.  I can handle people with a past, even an unsavory past; such characters are fascinating, even in their depravity.  But Shadow, Mr. Wednesday, Shadow's wife, Laura, the Russians...none of them do anything for me.  There is nothing in any of these characters to like, not even a shred of hope in them.<br /><br />It's an urban fantasy, yes, which is supposed to be dark, but even in \\"Neverwhere\\" Gaiman still managed to have a couple of likeable characters (and I like the way he used the London Underground in that story).<br /><br />Another nit/complaint: Does he have to have his characters curse in practically every bit of dialog?  (Although maybe I'm not progressive because an endless parade of curses is supposed to be great writing.)  I'm no prude (there have been plenty of times when I've let loose with a string of curses), and again, I know it's urban fantasy...but what does this prove?  That these characters are all vulgar, don't have much in terms of vocabulary?  Well, no kidding.  I get the idea.  Do I have to have it pounded into my head at every turn?<br /><br />I was less bothered by the sex acts, probably because there weren't many of them.  After all, I only managed to finish Chapter 5 before putting down the book for good.<br /><br />If I went past Chapter 5, would I change my mind?  Perhaps. (The asides of gods and goddesses coming to American shores over the years weren't bad.)  But I'd rather read or re-read something more enjoyable - like \\"Neverwhere.\\"Neverwhere.\\"
B000002UAU|5.0|Many would consider this to be the best Beatles album. I would make a case for Abbey Road (Rock's best album) or Revolver, but Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is by far their most innovative.<br />1967 was a very, very good year for music. Jimi Hendrix, after years of trying, finally broke through to the mainstream with the groundbreaking Are You Experienced? and Axis: Bold As Love, a good album although it does feel slightly rushed. Cream's Disraeli Gears fused heavy rock, blues and psychedelia, laying the groundwork for heavy metal in the process. The Doors burst on the scene from L.A., with their immortal debut album exploring the dark side of the '60's. Simon & Garfunkel's Bookends album was their best to date, while Van Morrison served up immortal rock classic Brown Eyed Girl. The Beatles themselves also put out Magical Mystery Tour, which has dated slightly but still is a fun release. But nothing, and I mean nothing, released in that year was better than Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />1. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: 10/10. Clearly intended to be a throwaway, this song has since risen to classic status. Part heavy rock, part marching-band tune, part singalong... no wonder it's so popular!<br />2. With a Little Help from My Friends: 10/10. Ringo's big showcase, a light-hearted, positive-thinking tune that never really leaves your head. And if you've never heard Joe Cocker's version, you're missing out.<br />3. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds: 10/10. Some people say it's about drugs (the initials are LSD, after all), others say it's about a painting done by John's young son Julian. Though both points are valid, who's gonna deny that this is one of John's most innovative, weirdest tunes?<br />4. Getting Better: 7.5/10. Many Beatles fans would place this high on their list, not me but it's still enjoyable.<br />5. Fixing a Hole: 10/10. Another one widely believed to be about drugs, when it's really about a house Paul owned that needed fixing. A very weird song, but in a good way.<br />6. She's Leaving Home: 8/10. Yes, the similar-sounding Eleanor Rigby is better, but She's Leaving Home still makes for a good listening experience.<br />7. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!: 10/10. Whoa... how high was John when he arranged this one? The nightmare carnival ride ambience is so damn cool that I can't help but give it a ten.<br />8. Within You, Without You: 7/10. This would've been a very good instrumental interlude - I find the lyrics shallow myself, especially compared to All Things Must Pass (the song, that is). Still, the instrumental break and rhythms are very interesting. Sadly, George's only tune on the album.<br />9. When I'm Sixty-Four: 10/10. Many will just dismiss this as filler. I don't know - sure it's light hearted, but it's a lot of fun and better than Paul's future music-hall experiments (Your Mother Should Know, Honey Pie)<br />10. Lovely Rita: 10/10. One of the catchiest songs here, plus the comb-and-paper solo at the end is brilliantly weird.<br />11. Good Morning Good Morning: 8.5/10. Another one many are quick to jump on as filler. I think it's a solid rock tune, plus the animal noises are awesome.<br />12. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise): 6/10. The closest thing this album has to a filler song. It's a bit unnecessary, but still not bad!<br />13. A Day in the Life: 10/10. By far the best song on this LP. John Lennon makes a song about reading the news into an epic about the condition of human life (there I go overanalyzing again...), and the orchestral buildup is priceless.<br />14. Inner Groove: 100000000/10. It's not even a real song, but it's brilliant all the same. Words of wisdom: \\"Never goosay any openwork! Never goosay any openwork! Never goosay any openwork! Never goosay any openwork!\\" or something like that...but in a good way.  6. She's Leaving Home: 8/10. Yes, the similar-sounding Eleanor Rigby is better, but She's Leaving Home still makes for a good listening experience.  7. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!: 10/10. Whoa... how high was John when he arranged this one? The nightmare carnival ride ambience is so damn cool that I can't help but give it a ten.  8. Within You, Without You: 7/10.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|It's hard to release a Beatles comp, since most their songs are in the good-to-great range. So what do they do? Put all their #1's on a single CD. As a result, we get the ideal starting point for Beatles fans. In fact, it's the ideal starting point for anyone who wants to get into classic rock. I can't say anything was missing, because this is strictly #1's, but I will say I'm not a big fan of Eleanor Rigby or the Spectorized Long and Winding Road (the original, on Let It Be Naked, is much better). Still, go here for the classics such as Love Me Do, Can't Buy Me Love, I Feel Fine, Day Tripper, Ticket to Ride, Penny Lane, the first four minutes of Hey Jude, Get Back, Come Together and Let It Be.
B00009Y2K9|5.0|Goosebumps! A masterpiece. A beautiful mix Of Afro Cuban, Spanish, and Brazilian songs intertwined with a most soulful Gipsy-flamenco style of vocal. Both Bebo and El Cigala are masters at their craft that give more depth to the classic songs than they originaly had. It's holy! <br />Rafael Vigil
B000000W5L|5.0|I will admit to positively loving this album. Rip This Joint just screams awesome, paced at a breakneck tempo, featuring some kick-you-know-what horns and lyrics such as \\"Wham, bam, Birmingham, Alabam', don't give a damn\\" and \\"Rip this joint, gonna save your soul, around and around and around we go.\\"<br /><br />Then there's Sweet Virginia (Got to Scrape the S___ right off your shoes!), Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, Happy, Torn and Frayed, Ventilator Blues, Just Want to See His Face, etc. I even like two songs commonly considered \\"filler\\", Turd on the Run and Casino Boogie. Sweet Black Angel is the only song I don't like. But I can't see anyone living on this planet not owning Exile on Main Street.
0792844890|4.0|Spaceballs is a very funny spoof on Star Wars.  Mel Brooks does it again.  However, it is marked as PG, but it should be PG-13.  I would have it in my video collection.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I have a theory as to why people irrationaly bash this album. Look what came before it: Abbey Road, their finest work. But just because this album isn't as good as Abbey Road doesn't mean it ain't good, folks. So let me begin the review.<br />Even if you don't like the album, but like the Beatles, you're crazy if you don't speak of songs like Get Back and Let It Be in hushed tones, with a bowed head. If you live in my house, you speak of this entire album that way. Dig a Pony, my favorite, deserves a bit of recgonition, as do One After 909, I've Got a Feeling, and I Me Mine. Plus we get the de-Spectorized (AKA good) version of Long and Winding Road. Across the Universe, meanwhile, takes you on a ride, sending you to John Lennon's drug-induced world. Then it drops you into the aforementioned masterpiece Let It Be. My one, very minor, complaint: the ending of the original Get Back (You know, the Oooh, get back, Loretta part) was cut. Thankfully, you can still get it on 1.<br />Although Let It Be didn't change anything the way Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper's, the White Album and Abbey Road did, it didn't really try to. Instead, you get a fun record that I'd recommend to any Beatle fan.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Some say that an artist can produce some of their best work, when in the thrones of a Relationship Break-up.....Judging by Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" album (written after a long term relationship ended), there appears to be some truth in the claims. Ditching his usual sonic diversity highlighted in albums such a \\"Mellow Gold\\" & \\"Odelay\\" (which took virtually every musical style & the kitchen sink for a sumptuous musical feast).....Beck went back to basics and crafted deeply intimate & Emotional Love songs. The Bittersweet sounds of pain & regret are clear for all to see in this quite wonderful album, This album feels as if Beck is sitting with the listener, and singing to each one individually!!.....So much so!!, that two listeners appreciation of the album can invoke different responses....with acoustic guitars & String arrangements interwoven, with Beck ever so Slight vocals, to creates a fundamental richness in the music, to exemplifies Beck as a musical genius, and a singer/songwriter par excellence.  Yet it should be noted that anyone looking for a continuation of his previous albums will be sorely disappointed, as their is none of the eclecticism that defined his previous work.  These are heartfelt singer/Songwriter songs, high on emotional attachment, and low on catchy hooks, and if you enter into this album with those facts in hand, this album can't possibly disappoint.   And although it at times a painfully intimate album, that is worlds away from the electronic/guitar/beat driven albums of old, there proved to be distinct cloud of melancholy hanging over this album, and Beck himself singing world-wearily over the sparse slide guitar, subdued bass, minimal drums, and distant banjos, swooning cello, and sombre electric piano & harmonica.  Arguably, it was never destined to match the commercial success of something like \\"Odelay\\", but its still a beautifully judged and introspectively reflective album, and with the overall proficiency of this troubled singer/songwriter album, truly deserved a wide audience.
B00004YX39|3.0|As a major Steely Dan fan, Gaucho disappointed me highly. Although most the album (especially Hey Nineteen and Gaucho) is likeable enough, there are still the filler songs Time out of Mind and Third World Man. Glamour Profession, Babylon Sisters, and My Rival show off a strange habit the group had of repeating the same riff over and over again, then calling it an ending.<br /><br />I would only recommend Gaucho to hardcore Danfans like me. You guys will get hidden gems Glamour Profession, Gaucho and My Rival. If you're new to the group, stay away from this one for a while.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Miserable Keanu Reeves film that is one of the worst movies ever made. Keanu is more than miscast in this film, he makes the film a real chore to watch with his horrible acting and lousy delivery of his lines. This is not his fault because he can be a good actor when he has the right material but he's not working with a full deck here and he's as bad as the film itself. The rest of the film is as bad as he is with a story that makes no sense and direction by music director who does not know the hell he is doing with the movie he's making. Some plot points go no where in terms of furthering the story a long and certain revelations don't makes any sense at all with the overall story. The special effects are not handled well and you really can't see much of the movie at all with how dark it is. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare do well with what they got and they both make this film bearable with their better than the script performances. Weisz deserves all the praise she is getting for her performance, and that's really because she's does give a better performance than the movie as a whole and Stormare does well with his ten minute cameo and does a better job with his role than most of the actors in the entire film.  <br /> <br />Now I have not read the comic book on which this film is based on but I hope it's a hell of a lot better than this lousy film.  <br />
B00005JLZN|4.0|So many critics complained that this film had a message or agenda, and that the filmmaker beat the audience over the head with the message. They talk as though this is a bad thing... in sea of look-alike adventure films with identical car chases, exploding fireballs, and heroes that can fly through the air, here we have a plausible drama that addresses a contentious issue in American culture. Yes, Parker has an anti-death penalty opinion -- he's from England for heaven's sake, and Europeans normally have a dim view of the United States' love for capital punishment. Especially in Texas. Parker's politics were clear as far back as Mississippi Burning. Is he supposed to ignore his own beliefs and make another orgy of car chases, shootouts, explosions and unsafe sex? No, instead he asks us to think, and at the end, answer some questions that we'd rather not: Have we executed innocent men? And, if so, is it worth it? I may not agree completely with Parker's politics, but I admire his courage.
006441034X|5.0|REGARDING THE MOVIE: Howl's Moving Castle (director Hayao Miyazaki) just came out in U.S. movie theatres June 2005. I saw the very first showing that came out at Loews theatre, NYC. The movie is as magical as you know to expect from Miyazaki, but remember not to expect it to match the book. You will be disappointed, because DWJ's books are a different sort of magical; they are not ostentatious in the same way as the movie, but rather practical, actually.<br /><br />REGARDING HOWL AND DIANA WYNNE JONES: In fact, the main character of this story, Sophie, is so down to earth that she fulfills every expectation of a dull eldest sister that she possibly can. Which isn't much, not with the Witch of the Waste after her, and Howl eating up hearts under her very roof. You could say that the book is about turning the fairy tale stereotypes upside down and inside out, so that the dullest, most crotchety sister gets her day, and it would be true. But DWJ always, always stays true to a certain logic of fairy tales, so that you're seeing the right side up view on top of the inside out view, or rather, the other way around. Expect tantrums, vanity, jealousy, neglect, misunderstandings, and all the difficulty of cleaning a moving castle. All you clean freaks out there, you know what a nightmare this can be. Oh yes, and a spectacular show of magic. As with catching a falling star, this book and many of DWJ's others as well, offer a pleasure all their own that you can't quite explain away.<br /><br />SEE ALSO: \\"Castle in the Air\\" is the sequel to this book. It has a different cast of main characters, with a few overlapping appearances. \\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is DWJ's most popular book, I think, and with reason. \\"Wilkin's Tooth\\" is quite similar in style to these, and one of my favorites.
B00003CXFV|2.0|I just can't find the Oscar material here. Keep in mind Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors (\\"The Limey\\" is destined to be a classic, I believe) and yes, the film is well shot and edited, but I find the subject matter... well, boring and predictable. I'm told by female friends that Erin is a \\"hero\\" to them. Hm? Single mom dresses and talks like a prostitute, has an uncontrollable temper, and takes everything personally, and wonders why people won't give her a break. Ok.... Single mom can't pay the phone bills but seems to have an endless supply of cash for spiked-heeled shoes. Am I leaving anything out? Oh, right: Once the class action suit is in place, the participants are more comfortable with her than the trained lawyers. Very nice, people skills are important in the legal profession. So is knowledge of the law! This is a blueprint for a heroine?
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Four pretty people with pretty unattractive personalities, engage in spirited if overblown oral pornography, so buried in lies that no one seems to know where the lies end and the 'love' begins. It might be easiest to say that the Jude Law curse strikes again but the script leaves him saying silly but intellectual things about truth and lying -- he doesn't know which he prefers -- and Clive Owen trying to justify his own pointless infidelity by demanding a blow-by-blow account of Anna's (Julia Roberts) trysts with the failed novelist, Dan (Law).    Natalie Portman is almost chubby, cherubic child-like in her miscast roll as a stripper while Roberts lends primarily her large mouth and height to a forlorn role as an uninspired photographer who is also perhaps the most indecisive woman on earth.    The conceit of this film is that it is supposed to say something about adult, intellectual, sophisticated love when the movie better exposes and shrugs off the dishonesty of infidelity. But I guess that candid, dirty talk generates 'respect' enough  for actors to earn Golden Globes and Academy Award nominations.    One good lesson from the film is that it will put you off anonymous sex chat rooms. A waste of 104 minutes.
B000067IZ3|5.0|Soderbergh makes films that respect my intelligence, my attention span, and my appreciation for small details. From the achronic pacing of \\"The Limey,\\" to the nice, subtle use of colors in \\"Out of Sight,\\" to... well, I can't say much nice about \\"Erin\\" -- 3 out of 4 ain't bad. Ahem. Anyway, each film is a treat. This one borders on overload. Believable characters. Good guys who miss. Bad guys who don't stand at the corner and say \\"I, Irving Schvarnowitz, Master of Evil, am here to rob you. Muhahahah!\\" but rather have the same goals we do (or might): Pay the lease on the Benz. Keep junior in private school. Pay the bills. Kill the rat. Well, 3 out of 4. Also, nice, subtle plot movements rather than those that beat you over the head. I must admit when the credits rolled, I said \\"What the heck? Oh wait... ahh... Nice.\\" And the copter shot over Zocalo... how the heck did he get permission for that?  <br /> <br />Thanks, Stephen. \\"Traffic\\" has planted you firmly atop the director mountain. I have no idea how you're gonna top this one.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This is one of the rare CD's that get better every time you hear it. There's no catchy hooks like the ones in Graceland, but it's suffused with the same spirit. Simon has always been the master of couching dark lyrics in emotions in upbeat tunes (think Sound of Silence). Listening to Cool, Cool River, Can't Run But and The Obvious Child makes you realize that he's still that dark spirit yearning upward for spiritual redemption. Not all the tunes are as much fun as the title song or Born At the Right Time, but they all hold out hope for a lost generation.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't know what to say about Firefly that other reviews haven't said before.  But I can tell you other things. <br /> <br />I was not an original fan of the show, I'll grant you that.  I wish I can say I was one of those few people that watched it from the original beginning on t.v.  But I shall speak the truth and say that I was not.  In fact, I remember catching the middle of an episode once before going to bed on a Friday night.   <br /> <br />When I heard Fox canceled the show, I was sad.  Buffy lasted for seven years, and Angel for five.  I was a HUGE Buffy fan, and had since the very beginning.  I knew that Joss has staying power, because his shows are smart and well-written, and touch every single aspect of the emotional spectrum necessary for a great t.v. show.  I was sad because I knew Joss had a good show, but he just wasn't given the chance necessary to show it off. <br /> <br />I say, Blame it on Fox. <br />But of course, they're eating their words right now of cancelling Firefly. <br /> <br />The fanbase of Firefly is amazing, and that's how I stumbled across it.  Through connections, I was able to view Firefly.  I watched the episodes in the order that Joss Whedon wanted them to be shown.  Immediately in episode 1 I was blown away and needed more.  Nathan Fillion is just captivating.  Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Renyolds (\\"Mal. Bad...in the latin\\" River honestly states in one episode) is that kind of character you latch yourself onto, wanting to go deeper into his psyche.  Adam Baldwin is a riot as Jayne Cobb, and Alan Tudyk is wonderful as the pilot we all come to know and love as \\"Wash\\".  Jewel Saite makes you giggle, especially in episode 4 in that dress of her's. <br /> <br />What makes Firefly so great is that it's realistic to the fact that all these characters can exist, and that we can relate so much to every single one of them, even the preacher that well, some don't really suspect is a preacher at all.  I raved for weeks to my best friend, telling her what a fantastic show we were missing out on.  When I finally was able to get the DVD set for my own, I gave myself a mini-marathon (Putting off a paper one night, to say the least) so I could watch them all over again.  My best friend watched the episodes, and then yelled at me why I hadn't gotten them to her sooner.  She just recently purchased them herself. <br /> <br />Now with the movie coming out soon, it just proves to Fox and the rest of world what they had missed out on.  Something so fantastically brillant that it /had/ to be brought to the big screen.  So start your journey here.  Settle down with your tv and dvd player, pop some popcorn, and let the violins in the opening credits help you to escape to the future with the people aboard the Firefly class ship, Serenity.
B000000W5L|3.0|I could count on the fingers of one hand the number of original, studio-made albums that wouldn't be improved by reducing them from 2 disks to one. Exile would not be on that list. The filler is stacked up in this one like styrofoam peanuts.  If you whittle it down to a single disk, you get this (not in any order, and your mileage may vary): <br />Rip This Joint <br />Tumbling Dice <br />Sweet Virginia <br />Stop Breaking Down <br />Rocks Off <br />Let It Loose <br />Loving Cup <br />All Down the Line <br />Happy  <br />Shine A Light <br /> <br />Well that's a respectable lineup, and it might even surpass Beggar's Banquet, but it only equals Sticky Fingers and it doesn't touch Let It Bleed.  As for those who say Exile isn't an album but a place, I'm not sure I'm into the mystical stuff, but I left that place about 1975 and I don't care to go back there again.  I guarantee you nobody has bothered to clean up the half-empty beer bottles, the bloody needles and the discarded condoms.
B00005JNJT|2.0|THIS FILM IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE IN THE WAY THAT IT CANCELS OUT THE ORIGINAL BATMAN MOVIE AND BATMAN RETURNS. TURNS OUT JACK NAPPIER DIDNT KILL BRUCE WAYNE'S PARENTS, IT WAS SOME OTHER BLOKE. THAT IS THE MAIN THING THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THIS FILM. ALSO AT THE END THE JOKER SEEMS TO BE HANDIN OUT CARDS. DONT THINK SO. NAPPIER FELL INTO A BOWL OF ACID AND TURNED INTO THE JOKER. HE ISNT THE SORT OF GUY TO GO THROWIN JOKER CARDS ABOUT. VERY STUPID. BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS ARE THE BEST BATMAN FILMS MADE. KEATON MUST BE OUTRAGED CUS I WOULD BE IF I WAS HIM!
B0000029DD|4.0|When I first heard Grace I was blown away, thinking it the greatest debut album ever. But I had just been reading the biography of Buckley and his father, and I think I was so enthralled by the story that I thought more highly of the music than I should have.  Not all the songs herein are works of genius, although there are several: the title song; the glorious cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" (you'll never be able to listen to the Shrek soundtrack again); and a couple of flat-out rockers that make you scratch your head wondering why Buckley never got any airplay.  And that voice! It's been called a mix of Robert Plant and Dino Vinelli, and it is, but that doesn't do it justice.  On \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" he sounds like a eunuch, yet he can get down and dirty on songs like \\"So Real\\" or \\"Eternal Life.\\"  And the CD ends on a transcendent note with \\"Dream Brother,\\" a tribute to his equally doomed father. Like Dad, Jeff could be a showboat with the voice, but if I had that voice I'd probably want to show it off too.
6304645635|4.0|If you are a fan of the gentlile Austen productions then this may not be your cup of tea, the Bronte novels were always grittier and harsher, speaking of struggle and cruelty towards women of the time. This is not exactly a faithful representation, modern audience pleasing devices are used to give the story a hook. Sometimes this is necessary with Victorian novel adaptaions as issues which where then shocking now barely raise an eyebrow, but I think not so with Bronte work, the gritty realism of times past in their novels is actually more shocking now for it's utter cruelty. For my money, adding modern twists for hook value cheapens the work.<br /><br /> Nonetheless, Graves is excellent and steals the show, Stevens is perfect as the romantic hereo but Fitzgerald is just a little too harsh, cold and unconvinsing. I had little connection, empathy nor sympathy with her characterisation and yet read the novel and the opposite happens, it strikes me she is trying to inject too much of the modern woman into the role which takes a whole dimension away from the character and robs the story.<br /><br /> Still, worth a shot if only for the male leads.
B000002KAT|5.0|It's a tough call giving this 5 stars. There's not a catchy pop tune anywhere, yet it's some of the most soulful music ever made. Much is made of the improvisational nature of the performances; actually I think that's not one of the bonuses of the album. The jazz backing is pretty perfunctory. I don't like the flute at all. But there are such strong pieces here - Madam George, Ballerina - that make all the imperfections add up to a masterpiece.
B00005JNTX|5.0|When the movie title appears, the lighting becomes dim and the audience receives its first glimpse of the evil portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Sin City is highly stylized and very violent. It is based on a graphic novel, but is also reminiscent of film noir of the 1940s and 50s. This is evident in the use of voice-overs, crime and the personalities of the characters. The extreme loyalty of the film to the novel is refreshing after so many disappointing adaptations such as The Hulk and Daredevil.<br /><br />The film was praised for staying true to its roots. The novel was often superimposed into shots of the film to make the two as identical as possible.<br /><br />The characters are stereotypical representations of what one might expect from a bad neighborhood. All of the men are murderers, even the police. There are good guys and corrupt ones and their clashes result in death most of the time. The women are strippers or prostitutes who use violence to take care of themselves or who utilize their men to do the dirty work for them. The cast is exceptional with stars such as Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro and Nick Stahl. The characters are highly controversial and they hardly depict role models which is cause for some to question why such famous actors would want to be part of such a project. Director Robert Rodriguez said, \\"Actors want to create memorable characters; they don't want to play themselves in movies over and over again.\\"<br /><br />The story itself is presented in layers. There is a short story with Josh Hartnett that acts as the very beginning and the end of the film. It is based on the short \\"The Customer is Always Right\\" and was created as a vehicle to sell the film to producers. The compelling story starring Bruce Willis ends and returns again after the two center stories. It is based on the short \\"That Yellow Bastard.\\" There are two middle stories that only have one segment each. One called \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" stars Mickey Rourke as a Hulk-like do-gooder that constantly faces trouble. A second non-returning segment stars Clive Owen and is based on the short \\"The Big Fat Kill.\\" Each story revolves around a man's love for a woman.<br /><br />Rodriguez was ejected from the Screen Actor's Guild for breaking one of the rules with Sin City, working with one or more co-directors.<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino appeared as a guest director and was paid only one dollar for his contribution. The style of the film is reminiscent of Tarentino's own work. The chronological structure of the film is similar to that in Pulp Fiction. There is even a homage to Reservoir Dogs when a man's ear is shot clean off. Tarentino's own fame has brought conflicting ideas about which scene he directed. The general consensus seems to be that he probably directed a relatively unimportant scene.<br /><br />This film is not for the weak at heart nor is it for women who easily get offended by films that might seem to degrade them on the surface. This film contains violence and female nudity. The nudity is not excessive and makes the film realistic.<br /><br />Violence is the most obvious element. It is so abundant that the film almost received a harsher rating than the R rating it received. The visual effects aid this dilemma. They make the amount of blood and the severity of the violence less intense. Some might say that the extremity of the violence is used to generate publicity. Male genitals are attacked several times throughout the film and cannibalism is an addressed issue. Each of these adds to the shock value. The film has been scrutinized by some for being too violent, but creator Frank Miller said, \\"Chuck Jones got criticism for violence!\\" referring to the creator of Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />The visual effects were so unrealistic, they had to be done on a green screen. The film was shot in color and was later changed to stark black and white through a digitalprocess.<br /><br />USA Today outlined the seven cardinal rules of movie-making that Sin City broke. These rules included never making black and white movies, never using voice-overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.<br /><br />Overall, Sin City seems to be a hit or a flop with people with no one in between. The sexuality, violence, and unusual film-making are certainly refreshing elements even if they shock instead of thrill.-making that Sin City broke. These rules included never making black and white movies, never using voice-overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.

B000063DHL|5.0|I love this album, but strangely enough, the first time I heard it, it didn't impress me much.  It wasn't \\"Wasted Years\\" or \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" that made me pick this up, but rather \\"Deja Vu\\".  I was in a band at the time, and was also a cartoonist, and had written a tongue-in-cheek comic book about our band in which we went forward in time to see how things would turn out.  At one point in the comic, we had to go back in time 5 minutes to prevent one of us from doing something stupid, and as I was drawing this, a friend sitting next to me said something like \\"Have them listen to \\"Deja Vu\\" by Iron Maiden as they go back.\\"  I'd never heard the song, but that's what made me curious about it. <br /> <br />Anyway, I liked \\"Deja Vu\\" from the first listen, but the rest of the album did little for me.  But after a few listens, it became one of my all-time favorite albums by any artist, and remains so.  It's got a great sound to it, and there's not a weak track on the album.  \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" and \\"Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" are two of my favorite tracks.  It's funny how something you end up liking so much can start out as something you don't really care for.  But if I were stranded on a desert island and could only have a few CDs with me, this would be one of them. <br /> <br />Oh, and the cover is great too -- check out all the hidden Maiden references!
B000002JPA|5.0|Wow.  There is so much to be said about this awesome release that cannot be put into words.  In a collection of over 800 albums, this is easily one of my favorites.  I worshipped this band for a large chunk of my life, I'm featured on one of their DVD's, and this is the album that started it all for me.  Wherever Don Deschennes of Waterbury, CT is right now, I still want to thank him for telling me to buy this album.  He played me clips of guitar solos from IMAGES & WORDS in 1993 and I went out and bought the disc.  I have not looked back since. <br /> <br />WHEN DREAM & DAY UNITE was a magnificent album, but true musical immortality was not reached until IMAGES & WORDS.  I've probably listened to this album at least 10,000 times.  There was a period during the mid-90's when all I listened to was IMAGES & WORDS and AWAKE.  I don't even need to put the cd on anymore, because I can just hear all the songs in my head. <br /> <br />'Pull Me Under' was the track that got most people to buy this cd, although it is not a fair representation of the band, and I find it to be the weakest moment of the album.  It lacks the near musical perfection of the rest of the tracks.  However, if that was all they could get MTV and the radio to play, I'm willing to come to terms with this.   <br /> <br />'Another Day' is a power ballad and it has to do with John Petrucci's father, who was diagnosed with cancer.  It features some soprano sax playing by Jay Beckenstein of Spyro Gyra.  The album was recorded at Bear Track Studios in Suffern, NY which is owned by Beckenstein.  We also hear some glass-shattering vocals from LaBrie who could have the range of Mariah Carey! <br /> <br />'Take the Time' can best be remembered for the mind boggling intstrumental break in the middle of the song, and I'm still pretty sure they recorded it to show off, which I have no problem with. <br /> <br />'Metropolis Part 1' is in competition for best song on the album.  I can listen to that song on repeat forthe rest of my life and never get bored.  It sounds like Metallica meets Frank Zappa meets Rush.  During the instrumental section, there's just about a meter change ever other measure, and James LaBrie sounds absolutely epic. <br /> <br />'Under a Glass Moon' is one of the heavier tracks on the album, and features one of my all time favorite John Petrucci guitar solos. <br /> <br />'Wait for Sleep' is a soft ballad featuring Kevin Moore on keyboards and LaBrie on vocals, and is a subtley beautiful transition into the progressive monster that is 'Learning to Live' which is probably my favorite track on the album.  It lasts for over ten minutes, and changes every ten seconds. <br /> <br />I order you to go out and buy this if you do not own it.  If you do own it, do the band a favor and buy it again, and give your other copy away to someone who is not familiar with it.
B000002H3E|4.0|Why do I call this a guilty pleasure: JUST LOOK AT THAT COVER!  Those outfits!  That hair!  The fog machine!  Oh man. <br /> <br />But it's the music that counts, and this is a very good album.  George Lynch remains one of rock's most underrated guitarists.  Check out \\"The Hunter\\" (which contains one of my all-time favorite guitar solos) and \\"In My Dreams\\" (which was covered by a dance band called \\"The Party\\" in 1991 -- their version sounds nothing like the one here).  \\"Slippin' Away\\" and \\"Will The Sun Rise?\\" are also good tracks...as is the rest of the album.  A fine effort by Dokken that pays off.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Hands down, this is her best work yet.  There is a pleasant variety of music styles used in this CD, all of which are attracting.  For those who are heartbroken, \\"La Tortura\\" and \\"No\\" will be your favorites.  If you like a rock and roll Shakira, then you'll like \\"Escondite ingles\\". Overall, I am very pleased with her music and it was worth the wait! Also, the thing I really loved about this CD is that it also includes a DVD w/her music video with Alejandro Sanz. That video is HOT, HOT. I recommend this to listeners of all ages.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have a very close relationship to Jesus and the faith I have in him is very strong. I've struggled throughout my life physically going in and out of hospitals with surgeries and procedures. Through this, I've always felt that Christ was always near me in my most trying times as a young child to my adult years. He's never given up on me and I'll never give up on him.  <br />When I first heard of the movie, I was curious to see how Mel Gibson would portray it. When it was finally released, part of me wanted to see it while the other part didn't. In a way, I felt I had to because in a way, I was there with him through *his* most trying times in his life. He was there for me when I was struggling, and by me watching him I was there for him. I was glad I saw it, but I will most likely never see it again. Once is enough for me. :) <br />I really do recommend people see this. Not only as a religious point of view, but as a learning experience for all.  <br /> <br />
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The final movie. Kill or be kill. The humans are tring their best to fight those machines they even have big machines themselves were they can go inside and control which makes it easier on them. Trinity died for good this time. And Neo in the end fight agent Smith I wish the fighting was a bit faster but what a good ending to the whole matrix series.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|If you like a nice, feel-good story, this is for you. Someone told me that it is not as good as an earlier, Japanese version. Maybe yes, maybe no, but the Japanese version has subtitles, and I hate subtitles. For me, this version sparkles. Richard Gere does his usual, outstanding job as John Clark, a mousy attorney who prepares wills. His wife, Beverly (beautifully played by Susan Sarandon), is loving and considerate, but a spark is missing from John's dismal life. As he rides the El to his Chicago home each night, he passes Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio, and each night he sees a lovely woman (played with understated elegance by Jennifer Lopez) staring into space from a studio window. Something in the scene touches a chord in him, and one night, he hops off the El and enrolls in a dance class. He and his fellow students are clumsy and sadly pathetic, but as they progress, a change comes over them. Beverly, concerned that he is having an affair, hires a detective to learn the startling truth. Everything comes to a whirling, glorious climax at the Chicago dancing schools' big dance contest. It will leave you smiling and humming the music. This is a truly enjoyable motion picture.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Well, there shouldn't be any complaining about this compilation, filled with each of the hits that Hendrix released as well as fan favourites moving along in a type of chronological order nicely. They haven't left out any key selections, placing the absolute essential in here(i.e. purple haze, foxy lady, all along the watchtower), while also including some sensational yet lesser known tracks like Dolly Dagger and Ezy Rider. A very good place to start if you're new to Hendrix, covering each of his studio albums with well selected, incredible songs.<br /><br />We begin with all the best hits from his debut, Fire is an awesome rocker and along with this comes the ugly rocker Manic Depression, the energetic Stone Free and the amazing track Hey Joe. The Wind Cries Mary is also a classic track to hear, and I'm sure many people aren't familiar with it. Red House gives the must needed bluesy flavour to the compilation, easily his biggest blues hit. The 2nd Hendrix album Axis: Bold As Love is covered quite nicely with the incredible self-titled track which features one of the most amazing Hendrix solos of his career, and also has the great classics If 6 Was 9, Castles Made Of Sand and Little Wing. However I think they made a crucial ommission by leaving out Spanish Castle Magic, a live standard for Jimmy and all around awesome rocker. Electric Ladyland could have been looked at more thoroughly, however they cover the obvious essentials such as Voodoo Child(Slight Return) and All Along The Watchtower. Crosstown Traffic is a great song, however Burning Of The Midnight Lamp could've been here seeing as it was released as a single. Plenty of music is covered on The First Rays Of The New Rising Sun album which is a great addition featuring wonderful tracks like Angel and Freedom. I would've preferred to see In From The Storm on this track listing though. Nevertheless well done by the Experience Hendrix family with choices.<br /><br />Overall, this \\"best of\\" compilation is highly recommended to anyone looking to get into Hendrix, offering some of the greatest rock songs ever composed featuring blistering guitar riffs and solos that all fans of rock n' roll should be able to enjoy.hly recommended to anyone looking to get into Hendrix, offering some of the greatest rock songs ever composed featuring blistering guitar riffs and solos that all fans of rock n' roll should be able to enjoy.   <br /> <br />
6305428557|5.0|There are already great reviews giving previews of the movie so I'll not do that again. <br />My son is 15 and my husband and I are in our 40's. We both adore this movie. You must sit back and take the time to see (and enjoy) the humor, share in the pain(s), the quirkiness, the light romance and be a part of this village of people who will use a number of means to turn their hill into a mountain. Did I mention that the movie is based on a true story? This is one of those movies that the more times you watch it, the more things you see and catch...ahhh. Give it a chance, you may be happily surprised. We've rewatched it a couple of times a year since it first came out and truly enjoy it each and every time. I think now we sit in anticipation of what's to come. <br />I'm already grinning just from thinking of the sugar and the train. It's time to watch it again. <br />
0804115613|5.0|I didn't expect much from this book- just happened to pick it from the shelf one day and thought I'd give it a try, even though I assumed it was a book about simple-minded people in a small community which I'd end up dropping after a day.  <br />I was wrong- immediately, the characters are endearing and compelling, and I found myself connecting with them and wishing I could take a trip to the whistlestop cafe- something which is rare in books nowadays. To those who might normally toss this book aside for something more \\"interesting,\\" such as myself, I suggest giving it a second glance- it is wittier and more poignant than, perhaps, it is given credit for.
0743265289|5.0|I am finally over with the GMAT... what a nice feeling :) <br />I decided to try and save some money and study on my own using all the books I could find. I used: <br /> <br />* Kaplan 800 (2005-2006) <br />* Kaplan 2005 <br />* Princeton 2003 <br />* The Official Guide <br />* Barron 2000 <br />* Kaplan and Princeton CD-ROMs. <br /> <br />I found the GMAT 800 very useful, especially in the verbal section. While doing the drills I was getting about half of them wrong, which allowed me to improve by learning from my mistakes. The Reading Comprehension passages are simply the ugliest one can imagine - Very good preparation for the exam. <br />The critical reasoning questions also had some nice edges to them and confusing answers to choose from (Reading the explanations removed the confusion and helped me understand the reasoning behind the answers) <br />Oh, and the Sentence Correction... These were a joy! Some very tough ones in that section and they touch all the types of questions that can be found in the exam. <br /> <br />The math section was o.k. It has the toughest math questions from all the books, but still not close enough to the real exam, and here I really felt there were too few question. <br /> <br />If had to choose two books to study with, I would choose this book and the official guide (and the CD-ROMs) <br /> <br />Overall this is an excellent book, either as a first book to introduce the different types of questions, or as a review of hard questions a week before the exam.  <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer who said this isn't so much traditional Celtic music as new-age Celtic. I like this kind of music and to me this CD is studded with jewels.  <br /> <br />I have listened to it many times over many months, and \\"haunting beauty\\" is the term I would apply to many of the songs. The selections are varied, and display the wealth of styles available outside of strictly traditional Celtic music today.  <br /> <br />Rather than go into many of the songs, I'll cite \\"May It Be\\" as a lavishly beautiful and inspiring song, and restrain myself from praising others. I am totally delighted to have bought this album, and would not want my music collection to be without it. <br /> <br />This is definetely a must have for your collection.  Notice many of the songs are by Enya.  Most of you have her but if you don't you should get her CDs.  Nobody does Enya as good as Enya of course!  This CD however does come very close.
B000000OSE|3.0|This is a great record.  It's got some of Slash's greatest riffs and Axl Roses' amazing vocals.  it starts off with a great bass riff in 'Right Next Door To Hell' and than goes into 'Dust N' Bones' which is one of the best Guns N' Roses Songs ever.  Though some of the songs are kind of weird (Need i mention 'Bad Obsession') this is still an amazing record.
6302130379|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of westerns, DO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! It will become one of your favorites. Great story - fine, fine acting by all - super cinematogrophy and wonderful music. Larry McMurtry at his best! And the movie portrays the book nearly word for word (but is better because you'll feel like you're actually LIVING the story).
B0001AP158|5.0|I love to rock with the best of them, but this intimate stripped down version was great.  The guys are having a ball and its not about money, if it was they would be on the road selling it to more than just a few thousand fans. Some of the reviews are deplorable and these people need to open up there ears and see things in a different light. <br />Bon Jovi deserve all the successes and accolades they have had in their 20 year career, and their good guys too.... <br />Thanks for 20 years of pleasure guys....
B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is an absolutely amazing album. All the songs are great and is fun to listen through the whole thing. The pace of the album never lets up, and the lyrics are funny but good. Everything that you could possibly want in a great CD is here. This CD surpasses MCR's debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, by a lot. While the first was good, this is much better. However, you won't find any slow and long ballads such as Vampires Will Never Hurt You or Demolition Lovers. Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is short (only about 40 minutes), fast-paced, and most importantly awesome.  <br /> <br />1. Helena - Great song to start off the album. Catchy and fast-paced with good lyrics, yet easy on the ears. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. Give Em' Hell Kid - Awesome song. Furious pace and fun lyrics. Hard to forget this one. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. To the End - Kind of a spooky song. \\"He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb.\\" See what I mean? Still a great, fast song with pretty good lyrics. Catchy like the others. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison - Best song on the CD. Enough said. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. I'm Not Okay - I didn't like it at first, but it's just so catchy that it soon became one of my favorites. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. The Ghost of You - Slowest song on the CD but that's not saying much. Still good. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You - Interesting song with some weird vocals. Weird is something to be expected from MCR though. If you don't like them, stick around for the good music. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. Interlude - Only negative part of the album. Slows the pace to much. Kinda pointless as well. 5/10 <br /> <br />9. Thank You for the Venom - Rivals You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison. Once again, enough said. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Hang Em' High - Another great fast paced song. I seem to be saying that a lot. Maybe it's because it's all just so good! 9/10 <br /><br />11. It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish - The only song that really has anything to do with Revenge. Go figure. 8/10 <br /> <br />12. Cemetery Drive - Another great song. MCR has a knack for good ones. 10/10 <br /> <br />13. I Never Told You What I Do for a Living - Great song to end the album with. Good vocals, good lyrics, good music, it's all here. Good closer since it ends with \\"They gave us two shots to the back of the head and we're all dead.\\" <br /> <br />Overall album score: 10/10  <br />GO GET IT!
B0008ENHTE|4.0|In acknowledgement of what would have been Steve McQueen's 75th anniversary several box set collections have been released that should do well in introducing McQueen to a whole new generation.  Perhaps the most significant release of these collections is Bullitt (Two Disc Special Edition) an all time favorite among fans of McQueen and 70's era police dramas.  In Bullitt, McQueen plays Frank Bullitt a tough police detective working for the San Francisco police department.  Bullitt is hand picked by an ambitious senator Walter Charmers (Robert Vaughn) to handle a seemingly routine assignment of providing protection for a mafia informant until he can testify in an upcoming hearing.  This routine assignment ends up being anything but as the informant's sequestered location is mysteriously leaked and a hit is put out on him.  The film boasts a fine cast with Jacqueline Bisset as the cultured girl friend to McQueen and Simon Oakland as the beleaguered police captain.  There is also a virtual who's who of performers that turn up in cameo appearances that would go on to have some measure of success in other roles through out the 70's.<br /><br />Bullitt was a surprise hit in 1968 thrusting McQueen into superstardom while becoming the virtual blueprint for every police film to follow in the 1970's.  Bullitt is perhaps best remembered for the high octane car chase scene that skidded through the streets of San Francisco.  On the special edition release the set up of the car chase is well chronicled by the stuntmen who worked with McQueen in one of the behind the scenes documentaries that are included.  There are also some anecdotal tales about the actual scenes that McQueen drove in for the film.  Another reason to check out the special edition release is the documentary Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool.  This documentary features candid recollections from first wife Neile McQueen and McQueen's lone surviving child Chad McQueen along with a host of co-stars and friends.  The thoughts and discussions in regard to McQueen do enlighten and reveal some insight into what drove him to reach the heights he ultimately achieved.  There is also a commentary by Director Peter Yates that is equal parts interesting, he explains why San Francisco was chosen over Los Angeles for on location shooting, and frustrating, he lets scene after scene go by with no comment while belaboring a point already made.  Still, this DVD is an exceptional and welcomed addition to the McQueen canon.The thoughts and discussions in regard to McQueen do enlighten and reveal some insight into what drove him to reach the heights he ultimately achieved.

B000002KFJ|5.0|Man this album is a killer. The last of a run of magnificience that began with their debut, 'Sabotage' can be seen as the band's masterwork, the culmination of six years of recording, touring and trend-setting. Many people compare this album favorably with its immediate predecessor, 'SBS' and I would agree in its ambitious grasp for technical greatness. This would definitely be the last time the original Sabs would have a triumph although at the time of its release in September 1975, the band had started its slow disintergration (decompostion?)as the seventies dragged on. It kinda bums me out that Ozzy has few kind worlds about 'Sabotage' due to his displeasure over the germination process that this album went through. However his performance is one of the greatest of his career!!!! The songs are mind blowing; opener \\"Hole in the Sky\\", a sledgehammer for sure, then a little acoustic ditty for about 40 seconds before Iommi hits you with the ultimate sucker punch - the riff to \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" is ungodly!! Easily one of Sabbath's greatest songs, including the hippy trip second part. \\"Megalomania\\" is another masterpiece and clocking at almost ten minutes, closes out the first half of the lp. Just for the three songs already mentioned should 'Sabotage' be exaulted, but album closer \\"The Writ\\" is diabolical!!! The anger in Ozzy voice with Geezer's lyrics openly ripping their management is a the perfect way to end the record. Yes I know they look like clowns on the album cover and \\"Am I Going Insane\\" blows but these certainly don't detract from 'Sabotage's greatness. Not until the end of the 70's when the Oz left were the band able to reattain their status as THE metal band on the planet (for a short while). Raise your glasses to Black Sabbath for the glory years of 1970-1975 and get the stupid Rock n'Roll Hall of Fame to give these guys their due.
B000002JNG|5.0|Robert Plant is truly one of the greatest artists of our time, he records the most rockin and compelling music i've ever listened to, and when he his together with his counterpart Jimmy Page they rule the damn planet.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|\\"Troy\\" doesn't pretend to be an accurate depiction of the Homeric epic poem but states in its credits that it is merely \\"inspired by\\" \\"The Iliad.\\" That kept in mind, this massive film has spectacle and beauty, and the feel and often the look of the great sword and sandal epics of the 1950s. Filmed in Mexico and Malta, the cinematography is a feast for the eyes, and there is wonderful detail in some of the lavish costuming and art direction. The romantic aspects of the story have been thankfully minimized, and the film focuses on the courage and heroism, as well as the lust for power and carnage of war.<br /><br />There are many excellent performances throughout, and I especially enjoy Eric Bana as Hector, and Sean Bean as Odysseus. Orlando Bloom is good as Paris, as are Peter O'Toole as Priam, Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Brian Cox as Agamemnon, Rose Byrne as Briseis, Vincent Regan as Eudorus, and a short but lovely appearance by Julie Christie as Achilles' mother, Thetis. Brad Pitt looks like a golden god and is believable as the larger than life Achilles, and is fantastic in the fight scenes. The brilliantly choreographed battle between Achilles and Hector is memorable, and has to be one of the best mano a mano action sequences in film history.<br /><br />Some of the loveliest music written today is for film, and James Horner has outdone himself in \\"Troy,\\" with the gorgeous song \\"Remember Me,\\" sung by Josh Groban, and the atmospheric voices of Tanja Tzarovska and Desislava Stefanova woven throughout the score. Wolfgang Peterson's sweeping direction, the cinematography of Paul Bond and Roger Pratt, and the script by David Benioff make this satisfying, and often riveting viewing, and it's a film that should be seen multiple times to fully appreciate. Total running time is 163 minutes.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I really like the first matrix but it lost some of it's touch when reloaded was released. I actually googled a couple reviews about it and found a really good one based on the whole trilogy:  <br />[...] <br />The author really has a good honest opinion about the whole thing and writes out exactly what I was thinking but couldn't quite put my finger on how to say it.
006054094X|2.0|Mr. Menzies is really reaching here. His findings are based on myths, legends, and folklore; not solid historical facts.
B00009M6VJ|1.0|Another liberal tear-jerking flick. The \\"surprise\\" ending is supposed to make us feel bad and finally see the light about how evil the dp is. Instead my wife and I got the feeling that maybe justice was served after all. Typically all the pro-dp characters in the movie are one-dimensional cartoons. They're all idiot bible-thumpers, including the governor who is of course a direct ripoff of George Bush. The plot is unbelievable, and when the final plot \\"twist\\" is revealed, I not only was glad for what happened in the movie to Spacey, I wanted to see the same justice done to the people who made this turkey. Another two plus hours of my life that I can't get back.
0790729652|2.0|I wanted to like Batman.  It has a lot going for it, including a dynamic visual style and (usually) a dark tone, but it also makes several critical mistakes.  We jump into the story to find that the mysterious Batman has just recently begun prowling the streets of Gotham City, and everyone is, obviously, wondering who he is and what his agenda is.  So, too, will the audience.  Though it is the first of what would become a series of four films about the character, it does not spend any time showing the origin of the character, save for a revelation late in the film that Bruce Wayne became Batman after his parents' death.  Throughout the film, I was never emotionally connected to Bruce, and the film suffered in that regard.  Similarly, though Jack Nicholson did a nice job as The Joker, I find that the film spends far too much time focusing on him rather than on Bruce Wayne/Batman who is, after all, supposed to be the central character of the movie.  It's called Batman, not The Joker.  Also, possibly because of the lack of emotional investment in the main character, the love story between Bruce and Vicky Vale always seemed tacked on and there's never a real chemistry between the two of them.  On the plus side, there's a great musical score by Danny Elf man that really helps to establish the slightly dark tone and feel of the film, and the special effects are incredible considering that this film was made in 1989.  Burton's direction is interesting and he has a very unique style, but it feels more like \\"Tim Burton's Batman\\" than true \\"Batman.\\"  For a deeper, more emotional, more exciting and less cheesy rendition of the character, I encourage you to see the amazing new film, Batman Begins; with a spotty script and not enough emotion, Burton's version of Batman unfortunately fails much more than it succeeds.
B00004W50T|4.0|Tempted to give it 5 stars.  Hesitate because it was the first music I ever listened to really intensely (as an adolescent). So I'm not too sure about my ability to listen to it dispassionately.   <br /> <br />That said, I think it's great -- even better, in my opinion, than the excellent second (brown) album.   <br /> <br />This re-issue, like that of the second album, is marred by amazingly empty and stupid liner notes, which include a lot of really pretentious, self-serving and masturbatory blathering from Robbie Robertson.  Ugh. <br /> <br />But the music itself is great!  Highly original, soulful, musical, funny. Great musicians, great singing. I love it, & just can't be objective about this one.
B00005JNJT|4.0|He began in Detective Comics # 27 in 1939 and a legend was born, his TV show brought new popularity, he was brought to the big screen in 4 feature films. Today at last, his background and orgin comes to life. The full amazing story of how \\"Batman Begins\\" One of the best Superhero Movies I ever seen among my top 3 favorites \\"Superman the Movie\\",and the two Spider-Man films and the best Batman I've seen in a really long time, Batman and Robin sucked. It's as good as the first Batman movie. A Superhero movie that explores more than just fighting crime and saving Gotham City, but how and why Billionare Bruce Wayne became the Caped Crusader, well it begins with a tragedy,then special training, advanched technology,a cave and a mask. An amazing top notch summer blockbuster, really cool art direction, a really cool high flying triumph and I'm even more excited for Fantastic 4, I think It will be better. See Batman Begins in theaters now and get the full extrodronary story of the masked avenger. \\"where are you\\" \\"right here\\"
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I can't believe how many reviews I have read saying that Gerard Butler can't sing..... are you people tone deaf?  Sure it a rock voice but that's what makes the part, that and the emotion he potrays with his voice.  If he sang the role perfectly he would be completely souless.  It's what makes his charcter different to Raoul.... the perfect gentleman with a polite, emotionless voice, like his character.  The Phantom on the otherhand is more red-blooded and needs a more emotional voice...... which I think Gerry portrays wonderfully.
B00005JKCH|2.0|I have 3 Disc Delux edition of this movie which consist of \\"Widescreen 2 Disc Special Edition\\" plus a bonus dist and beautiful outer Silver printed case. but 3 discs for what?<br />Bonus features are dissapointing and sort of ridiculous. there is no real details of making the movie. let's talk about 3 major documentaries on disc 2!<br />first, the evolution of spider-man! it contains some interviews with spider-man artists. approx 25 minutes waste of time. some old guys telling their memories. Stan lee did not even spoke of the original idea of creating spider-man, not showing some basic arts. nothing!<br /><br />second, HBO Documentary! some interviews with cast and crew. they talk, they laught but don't say anything useful. there is nothing about production of the movie! only talk about themselves. Kirsten dunst says Sam is good and Sam Raimi says Kirsten is good and they both laugh! dude! approx 30 minutes, waste of time!<br /><br />Third, entertainment channel exclusive! same as HBO but longer, approx 45 minutes. and the quality is awful!<br /><br />and there is some minor documentaries too plus some photo galleries. NO SIGN OF DELETED SCENES!<br /><br />You'll find some real behind the secenes documentaries on disc 3! it's approx 25 minutes but worth to all of the contents of disc 2!<br /><br />In my opoinion, if you want to have spider-man and only the movie is important for you, buy \\"SUPERBIT EDITION\\" which has no special features, but superb picture and sound quality!<br />If special features are important for you, buy 3 disc delux edition with no doubt, cause in 2 disc special edition (I don't see anything special here!!!!), you'll get nothin. really nothing! I wrote this review here instead of Delux edition's page to prevent you from buying this 2 disc edition which has really nothing!
B000063DFQ|5.0|I picked this up when it first came out in 1983. I was in the throes of teenage angst, and was looking for my release. This album was it. What inspired me to buy it was the cover. Can you not tell me that Iron Maidens covers are not the best?  <br /> Anyway, I threw this baby on the turntable and listened all the way through, replaying \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", and \\"Flight of Icarus\\" over and over till Mom told me to turn it down. <br /> Here I am 35 yrs. old and still listen to it, like it was yesterday. Maiden does not dissapoint, nor does this CD. The best songs, in my opinion, are WHERE EAGLES DARE, FLIGHT OF ICARUS, THE TROOPER (A personal fav, as I am in the Army),REVELATIONS, DIE WITH YOUR BOOTS ON. <br /> Put this CD in with one of the \\"Classics\\", because it is. You won't waste your money.
B0009NSE1K|4.0|One of my favorite things is when a Band changes things up a bit while still remaining true to themselves. Clutch has a storied history of this, the departure of Elephant Riders from the bombastic rock of its predecessor.  <br /> <br />Here Clutch explores the \\"jam band\\" territory a bit with songs focusing on solid grooves and traditionally abstract lyrics. The result is something new from Clutch that takes its place in the pantheon of Clutch brilliance. They managed to combine groove driven elecric rock with a kick of southern rock while stirring it up with a lyrical acid trip. <br /> <br />My perosnal faves are \\"The Incomparable Mr. Flannery\\" pure southern rock flavor, \\"10001110101\\" genius for its lyrics and blending of tempos withing one song, \\"Circus Maximus\\" for the same reasons- try to compare that with anything released today, and \\"10,000 witnesses\\" which comes as close as anyone has come recently in reviving while redefining the definition of pure southern rock fury. Plus, it has cowbell.
0875845851|5.0|Professor Clayton M. Christensen's excellent book is a classic of strategy literature. The innovator's dilemma is that doing the right things can lead to failure. Sometimes it is wrong to listen to customers, invest in the highest return opportunities and do all of the things that made a successful company succeed. Clearly written, amply documented, provocative and challenging, this book is indispensable for anyone in business. If it has a shortcoming, it is that it focuses more on the dilemma than on resolving it and it does not offer specific remedial prescriptions. However, Christensen has authored or co-authored two other books that attempt to remedy that deficiency. We heartily recommend this book, which remains the leader of the three. It has the potential to change the way managers think about business - any business.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Surprisingly good romantic comedy focusing on older people.  Who'd of thunk? lol <br /> <br />Most likely the best rom com of its year. <br /> <br />Tale centers on a man close to 60, played by Jack Nicholasan, who has a thing for young women, finding that they don't have \\"baggage\\", as he puts it.  One of the girls he dates, Amanda Peet (i.e. from cancelled TV show JACK & JILL and a host of other feature films), takes him to a family summer cottage where he meets Peet's character's mother played by, wait for it, Diane Keaton.  Story then focuses on the two of them getting together, breaking up and taking a long and twisted road before he \\"gets it\\".  Also look for Keanu Reeves as the love interest of Keaton and the Frances McDormand (known as the leading lady in FARGO) as Keaton's hippy oh so feminist sister. <br /> <br />Keaton was nominated by the AA for best actress but did not win it.  She did win it in the Golden Globes though. <br /> <br />Excellent interweaving of music, especially with Maroon 5's SUNDAY MORNING which focuses on healing. <br /> <br />
068987474X|5.0|This book is great, it helps you understand that guys are chickens and they rather give you mixed signals than tell you straight in your face that they don't like you as much as you do. If you ever wonder what happened with that guy that never called back... you'll find your answer here. I follow this book instructions from A to Z and I have a better and less stressfull love life. Also the book is fun to read.. Thank you GREG!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|Tale of a young girl in Paris with uncanny intuition who finds herself in a state of boredom which she cures by helping others who are leading turbulent, unsatisfying lives.  In doing so, she meets a man who touches her soul and eventually leads to love. <br /> <br />Look for how she firsts set up a meeting of the man through mystery. <br /> <br />Great movie for a date, assuming you're both romantic. <br /> <br />The director mentioned this started as a thriller but he so much enjoyed the love tale that he went with it.  Good thing.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Is the song Home written by Michael or is there an original and who is the artist of the original?
B000007RYQ|5.0|This is the story i was told when buying this record, it's been many years so this is as close as i could remember it: <br /> <br />\\"There is an annual competition where orchestras from all over the world come together to perform Mahler pieces. It's been going many many years... then along came Uri Caine. His orchestra  included Cantors (jewish religious singers) and a cacophony of other messy instruments and ideas to perform with. They won to competition to the horror of stuffy stuck-up Mahler purists the world over.. How could this horrible mess win over all ther other very traditional (very similar and boring) performances!? Uri Caine's orchestra has continued to win every year since. Why? Because Uri's interpretation gives a fuller understanding of Gustav Mahlers background, his roots, he brings so much life to the music.\\" <br /> <br />So then i actually listened to the music myself and it was breathtaking, funny, it told stories, it had personality, it was bursting at the seams with new ideas. <br /> <br />I listen to all kinds of music, but rarely jazz and rarely classical. I was not familiar with Uri Caine or Gustav Mahler, but after hearing that story, then listening for myself i had to have this cd. And while often my purchases are terrible mistakes, this one was a resounding success. This cd is my most treasured.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I love MCR...even though some of their fans have begun to turn on them for \\"selling out\\". Why is making it to the mainstream \\"selling out\\"? If the band is good they are eventually going to BE mainstream...isnt that the whole point??? <br /> <br />Well, politics aside this is a truly great album. MCR at their finest, no doubt better than their 2nd album. If you are a fan of The Used, Silverstein, Hawthorne Heights, Taking Back Sunday, Straylight Run ,A.F.I., or Saosin...this album is for you.
0393061310|5.0|A brilliant book for whoever is interested in human history. Jared Diamond's focus is on the last 13 thousand years or so, from the last Ice age up to now.  His aim is to compress so much in a readable book, distilling the main driving forces in human history. According to Diamond's thesis (and others before him) if you re-run the movie of the last 13000 years over and over, you would end up most of the times with similar dynamics (of course, chaos theories would anticipate some twists every time you run such improbable experiments). The main driving forces in human history in such large time span are: the diverse potential availability of wild crops and animals apt to domestication in the five continents gave a head start to peoples living in privileged \\"real estates\\"; the orientation of continental axis (North-South vs. East-West) and the presence of physical barriers within continents accelerated or hindered the diffusion and transfer of knowledge, culture and ideas; the population size and the related competition for space and resources promoted better organizations (the hydraulic theory of states) and creative ways for survival and expansion (a sort of \\"grow or die\\" theory). The book is successful in introducing (or making popular) crop and soil science in world history. Definitively a must read, before approaching the more technical \\"The History and Geography of Human Genes\\" by Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi and Piazza. Of course, other factors played a relevant role in history, and those factors have changed over the arc of time of your study. For instance, in the last 3000 years, in the West, Greco-Roman civilization has played her big role as much as Chinese unification in the Far East. If one focuses on the last 5 or 6 centuries, religion and state fragmentation in Europe and Middle East can explain many developments. Ivanhoe in the West and the Tale of Genji in Japan as far as literature is concerned can have an explanatory power, too. And so on. However, the driving forces that gave a head start to certain areas of the globe are well described in Guns, Germs, and Steel (a misleading title, by the way). If a weak spot this comment should highlight is the book's stinginess with tables and maps. <br /> <br />
B00004XONN|5.0|I couldn't really get into this cd at first because I had only heard The Bends and OK Computer -both are awesome- but much more accesible. A few days ago I was driving through Portland in the rain and I was still unsure about Kid A but I popped it in my cd player just for the heck of it and I just listened to Thom's sad voice and I suddenly completely got it. I listened to it from the first electronic tones of Everything in it's Right Place to the end of Motion Picture Soundtrack when Thom sings \\"I will see you in the next life\\". This is my new favorite Radiohead cd. Amnesiac is really good too but not as good as Kid A. I would reccomend this cd to open minded people who appreciate true art.
0385512058|4.0|What is networking. It is connecting, connecting with other people and developing relationships. this is what this book is allabout, how do we go about doing that, who do we try to get to know. Mr. Ferrazzi tells how a small town boy from Pennsylvania grew to become the master networker and how you can learn from his success.  <br />I liked this book alot and took a lot from it, to develop my own networking skills, I especially liked the part about not schmoozing but at a function try to have a great conversation with 2-3 people not superficial ones with many. I also enjoyed the section on how to get past a \\"gatekeeper\\" ie personal assistant to get to the person you are trying to get into contact with. <br />Great book on how to develop and expand your network.
B000002U82|5.0|To get the basics out of the way, my parents raised me on Pink Floyd, particularly \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  I appreciated it as a child but as I've become an adult in the last 5 years, I've learned to truly love what makes this album spectacular and separated from any other album. <br /> <br />\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" must truly be a monumental album for the London Symphony to honor it with a recording of it (this has been done for the Beatles and for Metallica's \\"Black\\" album only to my memory).  The mixture of guitars and synthesizers truly was monumental back in 1973 (10 years before I was born) and the perfection and balance of this album is remarkable.  The album proceeds almost like a giant opera with each song being a separate opus.  The guitar solos are unreal and the lyrics while seemingly simple do have deeper meanings attached to them.  The opening tracks, \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\" and \\"On the Run\\" really pull you into this album.  \\"Time\\" and \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" really have an ethereal feel that seems to catapult the listener to another place...not to mention the operatic-like voices on \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" just give this even more of an opera feel. <br /> <br />Ah yes, \\"Money\\".  This song deserves it's own little paragraph.  The lyrics are not only biting, but they are completely true.  This song is one of the most popular by Pink Floyd and for good reason...it's one of those songs that I crank up when I listen to the CD or when I hear it on the radio.  The guitar and saxaphone play in the middle of this song is monumental and there is no song that has that kind of combination that works as effectively as it does in this song. <br /> <br />\\"Us and Them\\" is probably my favorite Pink Floyd song ever recorded...the lyrics are simple but very poignant.  \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is a very transcendental type of track and yet it works despite its quirkyness.  \\"Brain Damage\\"...this is another WOW song on this album.  It's twisted and crazy but eerily seems to describe the darker side of human nature.  \\"Eclipse\\" ends off the album like any good finale in an opera would...with power and by connecting every little thing together. <br /> <br />This album is truly a musical masterpiece and like another review noted, it must be monumental since so many people under 30 own this album and the album came out over 30 years ago.  \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is an album that must be in any music lover's collection because it is truly one of the few musical pieces that is perfection in form but is a trip (no pun intended) in and of itself.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Incredible work of art. This is what music should be. There are not many words to describe this album, besides the fact that it is true euphoria upon the ears. <br /> <br />It is simple yet complex. <br />feathery yet massive <br />and structured with absolute perfection. <br />But to truly understand what this sounds like, give it a listen, its worth every minute. <br />
B000001FUZ|5.0|`John Barleycorn Must Die' may be Traffic's most mature album. It is certainly my favorite among all albums they released up to that point. And, most material after `John Barleycorn...' were live concert albums and reworking of older material.<br /><br />Five of the six tracks on this album were written by Steve Winwood or by the collaboration of Winwood and drummer Jim Capaldi. The title track, `John Barleycorn' is a traditional English folksong which the group performs as well or better than all the folk specialists in the house such as Renbourn / Jansch's Pentangle and Steeleye Span.<br /><br />This album also gives one of the strongest evidences of Traffic's role in creating a fusion between Rock and Jazz. The first track, `Glad' is a strongly Jazz influenced instrumental which is very easy to listen to, but possibly not that exciting.<br /><br />The second track, `Freedom Rider' has a great sax performance by Chris Wood which, to my very inexperienced ear sounds like it comes from the 1930s, if only for its strong resemblance to the theme to the Hercule Poirot episodes from the same period. After this riff of nostalgia, the sax takes off to more modern climes.<br /><br />Aside from the traditional title piece, I really don't get much from the songs' lyrics. Winwood is not the great lyricist. You don't get the simplicity of Lennon and McCartney or the stentorian tones of Keith Reid from Procol Harum of the same period.<br /><br />What you do get is superior instrumental work hung on simple songs with interesting but uninspiring themes.<br /><br />What is really important is that after the 35 years since I bought this album on LP, I still listen to it on a regular basis in rotation with all my other 1960s favorites.

You don't get the simplicity of Lennon and McCartney or the stentorian tones of Keith Reid from Procol Harum of the same period.<br /><br />What you do get is superior instrumental work hung on simple songs with interesting but uninspiring themes.<br /><br />What is really important is that after the 35 years since I bought this album on LP, I still listen to it on a regular basis in rotation with all my other 1960s favorites.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Tale of a female assassin who is betrayed by her organization and, after recovery, begins the process of hunting each individual down separately.  Promises lots of gore, slick fighting scenes and Uma Thurman back on the screen. <br /> <br />Best scene was the fight sequence against the Crazy 88.  Very kewl. :) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, no audio commentary from Tarantino.
B00003CXDV|5.0|What happens when the only good part of your acting career was a show that was cancelled many years before?  Well, if it was a science fiction show, you can relive your character at science fiction conventions.  That is what has happened to the cast of Galaxy Quest and they are not particularly happy about it.  Then they get a second chance. <br /> <br />Aliens far out in space have intercepted Earth's television signals.  As they have no concept of fiction, they believe the shows are reality.  They have decided to base their society on that seen in Galaxy Quest.  They are peaceful but at war with another species that is anything but.  They think their only hope is the crew from Galaxy Quest.  They have seen them defeat evil on countless occasions.  They have now come to Earth to enlist the crew. <br /> <br />The cast finds themselves in a real life and death struggle deep in space.  While they know they are only actors, they get talked into helping.  Plot complications, humor, and plenty of action keep the ball rolling right to the end.  What could easily have been a movie based on one bad joke is really so much more.  Science fiction fans will get a lot of in jokes and cliches but non-fans can also enjoy the movie fully.  A truly fun film.
0930289528|5.0|Befitting its lofty reputation in the graphic-novel genre, Alan Moore's V for Vendetta is a masterwork, a morality play of epic proportions, taking place in a possible futuristic England (actually, it's the late 1990's, but it was futuristic when the story came out) and bringing to life its author's frightful dystopian vision of a country on the brink.  David Lloyd's darkly minimal artwork perfectly mirrors the rot lurking under the orderly façade of Leader Adam Susan's fascist regime, a façade Moore's story penetrates to reveal the ugly truth that things are much as they are in any other society.  Corruption, intrigue, and double-dealing still rule the day, whether it be cops taking advantage of a naïve teenage girl trying to earn some extra money working a corner, the ambitious wife of a party official paying off a gangster to help ensure her husband's rise for her own ends, or a dirty old Bishop using his position to arrange for illicit sexual encounters with girls a bit, er, on the younger side.<br /><br />However, there a couple of true believers out there, namely Susan, who's abandoned any hope of luxury in order to devote his life to the Nordic race; and V, the book's title character, the unidentified terrorist trying to bring down the order that Susan and his followers have created to clear the way for a new, voluntary anarchist order.  It's the conflict between these two men and all they represent that frames the story, and while much of the attention is focused on V, there can be no V without a Susan, and the central tension between their ideals is always present.<br /><br />Now, the term \\"terrorist\\" has certainly acquired a decidedly negative connotation in this time and place, conjuring up images of Muslim fanatics piloting airliners into skyscrapers and planning God knows what else, and V does indeed commit some actions that could be considered reprehensible.  But as anyone who pays attention knows, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and V seeks to bestow on the people of England the kind of freedom that few ever talk of, let alone achieve.  Hiding his visage behind a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, V is a sort of mix of the Phantom of the Opera and Fight Club's Tyler Durden, offering the people of England the tantalizing prospect of liberation from the prison that they themselves have created.  Transformed both physically and mentally by his harrowing tenure in one of the government's relocation camps after the post-Cold War ascension to power of the fascist Norsefire Brigades, V has now dedicated his life to performing stunning acts of violence and subversion, hoping to rouse the people of England from the comfortable chains they currently wear.<br /><br />Now, at this point it becomes necessary to distinguish between license, which many people the world over have, and freedom, which requires the kind of sacrifices that people in affluent societies like ours rarely contemplate. In this country, we talk of \\"freedom\\" (and launch wars in its name) while simultaneously paying confiscatory taxes and obeying ever-more restrictive laws, but V offers the real thing: the freedom that comes from having nothing to lose, from being ruled by principles rather than possessions.  It can be gained in strange places, such as the \\"prison\\" where V's young prot&eacute;g&eacute; Evey discovers hers, but it can never be bestowed or taken away from without.<br /><br />Of course, V for Vendetta leaves unanswered a crucial question, namely: do people really want freedom of the sort that V holds out?  Or do they just want order, comfort, and stability?  Under the rule of Susan, the people do have order, and uniformity, and propaganda disguised as entertainment (or is the other way around?) and a landscape unblemished by the sight of the yids, the darkies, the nancy-boys, and the beatniks.  Sad to say, that may be all they really want.  In V for Vendetta, V and Susan represent the two conflicting poles of mankind's desires, and it's not at all clear which one will win out.  It does, however, make for a pretty rousing read.and it's not at all clear which one will win out.  It does, however, make for a pretty rousing read. <br />
0525457585|5.0|No book loving house should be without this classic. The hardback is beautifully done - it even has text in two different colors: green/brown. One is about the boy in HIS world and the other color is about the boy in the other world... Cleverly done. I loved this book as a kid and rereading it as an adult brings back fond memories - I'm keeping this for my daughter to read one day.  If you can get your hands on a hardback book, buy it quick - this book is very hard to find. (I believe it's out of print.)
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|Ray Charles was indeed an American Treasure. However over time even the best voice will fade. That is the case here. Ironically all of the guest vocalists where better than Ray. This is especially prevalent with Natalie Cole. As I listened to this CD I smiled as I heard the voice of the century. But, it was not the voice of 10 years ago. I enjoyed the nostalgia, but the power of Ray's voice was not there. As long as you understand this, you will enjoy the CD.
B00005B36H|5.0|after reading some of the other reviews on lateralus i felt almost unworthy to write my own review of the so called greatest album ever created. im sure there are infinite meaning to the lyrics in each of the songs, but i really dont care about any of the lyrics in any of the music i listen too. if somehow i had no understanding of what maynard was saying during the songs it would make no difference to me.<br /><br />laturalus offers some of the most unique original music i have ever heard before. it has a good balance of soft, heavy, progressive, and everything in between. maynard is a great vocalist bringing life to his songs, like \\"grudge\\" were he screams for about 20 seconds straight without fading away. the drumming and guitar are also exceptional, flowing perfectly with maynards voice making it sound even more powerful than ever. you can hear the guitar and drumming by themselves on my favorite track, the instrumental \\"triad\\".<br /><br />i first bought this cd after hearing the title track \\"lateralus\\" and \\"schism\\" on the radio, but now, after buying the cd and owning for about a year and a half it has grown on me very much. i listen to as much as my newest cds and still enjoy it greatly. lateralus is a very dark cd, definitely like no other, not just because of the lyrics, but also the music.<br /><br />five solid stars for lateralus, tools greatest achievement. even better than undertow and aenima.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye is definetly the best addition to Roc-A-Fella. He's a great producer/rapper.  <br /> <br />1. Intro- (Skit) Not rated <br /> <br />2. We Don't Care- A friendly/nice song \\"for the kids,\\" nice beat. Chorus has kids in it, I thought it ruined the song a little.- 8/10 <br /> <br />3. Graduation Day- (Skit) Not rated <br /> <br />4. All Falls Down- A nice collaboration with Syleena Johnson. Hot beat and Kanye has some nice rhymes in this song. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />5. I'll Fly Away- A short gospel song, I think Tony Williams is in this. (A skit/short song, nice singing tho) <br /> <br />6. Spaceship- A slow song, kind of goes with \\"Slow Jamz.\\" Has collaboration with GLC & Consequence. Good beat, kind of a R&B song. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. Jesus Walks- A nice song that is obviously about Jesus. I love the beat and Kanye's lyrics in this song. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />8. Never Let Me Down- One of the best songs in this CD, probably in the top 3. Hot beat, Jay-Z is in this song, along with J. Ivy. Jigga's verse killed (in a good way) the song. Nice chorus. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />9. Get Em High- One of Kanye's best productions. A colaboration with two hot underated MCs, Talib Kweli & Common. Hot song. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Workout Plan- (Skit) Not rated.  <br /> <br />11. The New Workout Plan- It was one of Kanye's single. Nice beat, but I dont know about Kanye's lyrics in this song. 7/10 <br /> <br />12. Slow Jamz- A slow song, but when Twista came in, it turned into a hotass fast song. Nice collabo with Jamie Foxx & Twista. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />13. Breathe In Breathe Out- Luda!! Okay beat, both Luda and Kanye had some nice rhymes. Skipable though. But it still gets the job done. 7/10 <br /> <br />14. School Spirit Skit 1- Another one of those skits/short songs. <br /> <br />15. School Spirit- One of Kanye's singles (Which  means no collabo), its about college. Okay song, nice beat. 7/10 <br /> <br />16. School Spirit Skit 2- And yet another one of those skits/short songs. <br /> <br />17. Lil Jimmy Skit- And ANOTHER one of those skits/short songs. <br /> <br />18. Two Words- My favorite song, DAMN nice beat and like the rhymes by Mos Def & labelmate, Freeway. 10/10 <br /> <br />19. Through The Wire- Nice song, its like a remake of \\"Throught The Fire\\" By Chaka Kahn. I like this song, Kanye did this while having his mouth wired-shut. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />20. Family Business- Kanye's 2nd solo song. Its a nice song, great beat and good chorus. One of Kanye's best rhymes in this CD. 9/10 <br /> <br />21. Last Call- One of the top 3 songs in this Cd. And kanye's 3rd solo song. A GREAT song to end the album. Its about 12 minutes long and he says how he got his record deal. One of those songs that you cant get enough of. 10/10. <br /> <br />Overall- 9/10

B0000TB014|5.0|I've read some of the negative less appreciative views and I feel they are unjustified. This DVD was released during the most traumatic situations of Michael's life. Michael's life and character were being put on display with ridicule and false accusations and A WARRANT for his arrest. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the simple format and the songs that I hadn't seen before on DVD: \\"Dirty Diana\\" and \\"You Rock My World\\". I especially wanted the \\"Dirty Diana\\" video. It didn't matter that \\"YRMW\\" was shortened, it was longer than the MTV version. Also, I loved this version of \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" because it showcased Michael's dancing more than the version on \\"History On Film, Volume II\\". <br /> <br />Since I have the other DVDs that show extended versions of \\"Black or White\\", \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", \\"Bad\\", etc. it didn't matter that the videos were shortened on this DVD. I love the flow of the music. The songs come fast and it's MICHAEL JACKSON and that's all that matters!
0679746048|3.0|I purchased this book on a whim, as I'd seen the movie trailers and they looked interesting. I think this is one of the few times that I will argue that a movie has outdone a book. My reasoning? The flow in this book is difficult. I'm sure that part of that fact is due to the necessity of portraying an accurate picture of mental illness. Kaysen's book jumps around, not quite as badly as \\"stream of consciousness\\" writing, but almost. I've been through this book twice now, having finished it last night, and still haven't found the magic that has brought on it's popularity.<br /><br />Sadly, the most interesting parts of this novel were the printed forms from the hospital itself. I had an easier time following and deciphering these than I did Kaysen's writings.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a bit miffed I spent money on this book.

Now you will have my review. I want to say two things before I press play on the menu to start the movie - 1. The looping Casiotones rock! 2. I'm afraid this is going to be a movie all about my life.<br /><br />The intro is pretty sweet. I like the foods idea, my favorite one was the edited Lemonheads box.<br /><br />Wow... I'm seventeen minutes in and I'm really not sure what's going on other than he's a complete dork. Yes, I am scared, because seventeen minutes in, he is me, only with slightly worse fashion sense, and the jocks never beat me up.<br /><br />Real quick question - since when do llamas eat ham? I love this. It's weird.... the Dynamites live in the eighties, but at the same time in the naughts. They have the Internet and cool shiny bikes, and it's like he fell out of twenty years ago. I love it!<br /><br />Tetherball is an awesome sport sometimes, but it helps if you have someone to play with.<br /><br />I love how Trisha's mom is forcing her to go to the prom! I wish I would have asked someone out that was hot and an overbearing control-freak mother that made her go to the Prom.<br /><br />Mmmm, Tater Tots. I'm hungry now.<br /><br />Dance - 80s music rules!!!! (Even if it is Cyndi Lauper. :P)<br /><br />La Fwanda(sp?) - Eww, what an ugly girl!

Yikes!<br /><br />It's amazing what a change a slight makeover can do. Kip looks relatively cool, yet still dorky as a biker dude. Napoleon should do that. I'm a little shocked at how normal he actually looks. (Jon Heder that is)<br /><br />Well, this is ridiculous type funny. You'd think I would have gotten that before I rented it, but that's okay.<br /><br />I am bursting out with laughter right now watching him dance. He does so much better than I ever could!<br /><br />Overall, pretty good movie. I might buy it someday.al he actually looks. (Jon Heder that is) <br /> <br />Well, this is ridiculous type funny.

B00003CXFV|5.0|Julia Roberts delivers my second favorite performance my first being Pretty Woman well worth the Oscar I love that scene where the guy asks her for her number? Saucy. Julia is at her best here in a story that touches you in a fundamental way and shows that the determination of one person can make a difference. Inspiring!!!
B00000BKE0|5.0|I love it. It was a time of major changes for Iron Maiden: First change in lineup since \\"Piece Of Mind\\", and with new guitarist Janick Guers they went back to a more raw sound... It's sounds almost like their first album. Also at that point, Bruce Dickinson gave up all the high pitch wailing that makes a lot of people hate Maiden, and he went for deeper, angrier vocals. He finally reveals his sense of humour with those \\"Hee!Hees!\\".  <br />After all those extremely successful albums, all they could do was decline, but \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" includes their ONLY #1 HIT SINGLE \\"Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\\". Come On... Isn't that a great song?  <br />Once again, the people who hate this album are the music fascists who can't accept changes and would have liked another classic album with Adrian Smith on guitar... GET A LIFE!  <br /> <br />P.S.: That new cover is rubbish. The man being strangled has been wiped away. Now Eddie isn't strangling anything. He looks like a pathetic zombie.
B0001CNRS4|3.0|.... but haven't we already seen this in the 80's movie \\"Flash Dance\\" and recently in \\"Save the last Dance\\" which were all better than this but I like Jessica Alba and I liked the dance moves and that's what made me sit through this. I'd rent it rather than buy it.

B00005YW4H|1.0|...zzzzz....huh? Oh. Sorry about that. I was listening to this CD I bought, and was just about to write a review for it when I fell into a deep coma-like sleep, which resulted in my head landing on the \\"z\\" key. Well, on to my review. <br /> <br />This music is boring, slow, and lifeless. I love slow music, but this stuff is completely unimaginitive. I can't believe she won a grammy for this. Then again, when has anybody that recieved a grammy worthy of one.
B00022TPSO|5.0|I'm sick of all these kids who think Nu Metal is \\"soooo original\\" and think they know better. \\"Black Sabath\\" is the first metal album and it's a lot more diverse than your Korny. Tell me how metal could have been created in 1994 if we already had 1/4 century of metal like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Saxon and many more...?   Now shut up and go slit your wrist!
B0000027RL|3.0|Scott Stapp, frontman of Pearl Jam and Creed did pretty good with this release. It's got those songs \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Black\\" on it that were pretty big hits. It's works pretty good, but misses the mark. But Stapp's best work is with his new band \\"Creed\\". Get \\"My Own Prison\\" and see the great improvement that has been made from \\"Ten\\".

B0009R1T7M|5.0|This album builds on the best parts of Sufjan's earlier Michigan album as well as Seven Swans. It has the lyrics and the great storytelling that make him a standout from so many dime-a-dozen 'singer-songwriters' out there.  There is some intelligent social commentary packed in without being heavy handed or overtly political.<br /><br />The music itself is beautiful.  He somehow retains his folk feel but goes all out with the strings and female backup vocals in several songs.<br /><br />The song \\"John Wayne Gacy\\" is probably the ultimate juxtaposition: lyrics that cover incredibly dark subject matter set to beautiful instrumentation and light vocals.<br /><br />Definitely worth owning.  Fans of Wilco, Stephen Malkmus, the Shins, Damien Jurado, or Elliott Smith should give Sufjan a listen.
B0000251VP|5.0|...but I have the single. Great Track. Great Album. I prefer this to what they do now because it doesn't sound as dramatic and high quality (i.e. \\"Brave New World\\" + \\"Dance Of Death\\").<br />The only complaint I have about this re-release is the new CGI cover. What was wrong with Derek Riggs' masterpiece which was reduced to the CD label? Disgraceful...
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah is back with another product. The good news is this album is worth purchasing and adding to your music library.<br /><br />If you are partial to solid pop songs influenced by r/b and sung to perfection then the material on this CD will impress your ears.<br /><br />Mariah's vocals are once again in fine form. However, what is truly remarkable on this project is the caliber of songs. The material shines while the musical production surrounding Mariah is rejuvenated.<br /><br />The track \\"Circles\\" is a tour de force for any serious vocalist. On this Cd Mariah will impress and not overwhelm critics and the audience with her natural talent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the current problem with Miss Carey's career is not her vocal talent but her public image.<br /><br />She is often perceived worldwide as a self-absorbed diva/bimbo who loves to prance for the camera in micro miniskirts the size of a napkin. A segment of her audiences have become distracted by that image while becoming deaf to her God given talent.<br /><br />That is the major fault with this CD, the artwork! The cover artwork does not enhance Carey's image as a serious international musical stylists but further promotes the image of fashion floozy. Mariah does not need to attempt to compete with Beyonce's sexkitten image, Mariah is possibly the best vocalist / songwriters on the planet!<br /><br />Maybe someone from A/R at her label should seriously look into altering her image and reajusting the \\"tart factor\\" on any future projects.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I read about this game winning awards and decided to get it for the family a few years ago.  Whenever we have company someone wants to play.  No dice to roll, no cards to read.  It is never the same twice; the board looks different at the end of each game.  It is important to not loose any pieces... We count them as we put them away into 4 different zip-lock bags. Great fun for all ages.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I havent seen the phantom on the stage.  But seeing it in the theatre has inspired me to buy the DVD.  The chills that I get come back time and time again.  The music has truly inspired my life, and has made me appreciate the art of opera.  This movie is true brilliance and a masterpiece.
B000002OR4|5.0|This soundtrack is very emotional and touching.  The violins touch your heart, and although it is sad, it is wonderful music.  If you have seen the movie this will be especially touching, as your mind will remember parts of the movie where the music played an important role.  If you like violins, classical music, or the movie, you will like this CD!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has again showed it's magnum opus ability. I really cannot express my deep admiration for them. Their music talent is extraordinary.

COLDPLAY ROCKS MY SOCKS!!
B00005A1VH|5.0|What a terrific war film.  This is about the most decorated American soldier of WWI.  He was not only a war hero, but also a born again Christian, and this tells of his convictions about war among other things.  A very patriotic man, he realized that although war is not a good thing, sometimes it is necessary to keep his family and country free.  Sentimential--sure!  Dated--sure!  But dated and sentimental is just fine when it's a true story!  I love this, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Gary Cooper is great(as always) and the action is excellent too.  There's nothing I don't like about this movie!
B00082IJ08|4.0|Good album, gets a little weak near the end though. Being a huge Blur fan I find it a shame that the only way Damon Albarn can get on mtv in America is to be a cartoon character. It just goes to show the lack of people who like good music over here... Enjoy the album though.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Music is strong stuff. But it can't work its magic if you don't give it a chance. When you are willing to give in and let the mind dive into the well of what is music, I think any genre, and any style is destined to pluck a string in your heart. I let this happen once. I let go of all previous assumptions and expectations and just listened. I awakened to the sounds of another world. OK Computer swung the front gates wide open. <br /> <br />I still don't know anything about Radiohead outside of the name Thom Yorke and the band's radical shift in musical path through the years. But I feel a whole lot of what Radiohead leaves behind in my mind everytime I listen to their truly unique sound. OK Computer is lonely like an abandoned city. Yet underneath the tension, I feel crowded and overwhelmed by confusion and uncertainty. Every song repeats this experience in a slightly different way. Out of the emptiness of the echoing guitars, rumbling drums, and the ghostlike voice comes a swirl of emotions that I never realized existed. OK Computer isn't rock music because it emits sensations unknown to rock, old or new. <br /> <br />I didn't like Radiohead - not even their earlier works. Yet time and time again music has figured out ways to shove me into new territory. Kid A was another leap. Amnesiac redefined Kid A's sound and Hail to the Thief brought years of exploring down to earth. <br /> <br />The true extent of OK Computer's influences on the musical landscape is still unknown. The road that their music will lead us to is still unclear. One thing is certain though. Radiohead will continue to broaden our concept of what we call music and fling our minds further and further away from the safety of what's normal. <br />
B00000889Y|5.0|For any old school Cramps fans, this seventeen track compilation disc is a should-have. When I looked more closely to the track listing, I realized it was a combination of the 'Gravest Hits' five-song EP along with their 'Bad Music For Bad People' lp. Even though all these vintage psycho-billy tunes have indeed been released several times before, 'Off The Bone' is STILL worth owning a copy of. It's always fun to hear \\"Human Fly\\", \\"Surfin' Bird\\", the awesome \\"Drug Train\\", \\"Go Goo Muck\\" and \\"Uranium Rock\\" as well as the others. Nice mysterious cover. Enjoy.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone returns and this time they are beginning us Team America: World Police, and this time the characters are little marionettes, that are trying to save the world from terrisom, I wonder if 9/11 was Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Influcence to make this movie. Trey Parker gives voice to Gary/Joe/Kim/Blix/Carson/Drunk/Damon/Robbins, with along singing, directing, and being crew on this film. Matt Stone only has 2 characters Chris/Matt Damon. But there are other characters that are not voiced by Trey or Matt, Lisa (voice of Kristen Miller), Sarah (voice of Masasa), Spottiswoode (voice of Daran Norris) , I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E./Chechnyan Terrorist (voice of Phil Hendrie) , Alec Baldwin (voice of Maurice LaMarche), French Mother (Chelsea Magritte) , Jean Francois (voice of Jeremy Shada) , Samuel L. Jackson (voice of Fred Tatasciore) . There are more characters/voices that were not credited, and the best website I can think of to check them out is the Internet movie database. The set up is that a puppet named Johnny Carson is killed in action, just moments after asking his girlfirend, Lisa to marry him. The main boos, or the boss Mr. Spottswoode, spots an actor named Gary Johnson in a play that is a musical named Lease, where Gary has a song titled \\"Everyone has aides\\". I don't think this is all the way true, but he gets backstafe, nad offs him a deal if he follows him to his limo, but of course he doesn't want to acto like he is a terriost to get infromation, but somehow is manged to being coxed in the deal by Lisa. I bet a lot of people view Trey Parker, and Matt Stone has sick, but this is just what they like to do, make tv shows, and movies animated/live action for adutls, whether or not they are a hit.
0767812166|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and I love this movie as an adult.  I am now 28 years old.   This movie really makes you think about the savageness of the human species.   The movie made me think long and hard about two things:  1) is it moral to slaughter animals, especially those that do not threaten us?  2) is our modern society really as sophisticated as we think, or much more primitive than we'd like to believe?    Good movies should make us think, and this one definitely does.
0156027321|5.0|It's been a while that I have read a book that has educated me in new fields of study and given me insight to the ways of human situations.   <br />Pi is a character that is easy to understand; he is curious about what it means to be a human.  I felt that I could have been him at different points in my life. <br />The ending wasstrange indeed and made me turn back to the very first page to begin reading again.  I have been unable to let this book out of my sight.  It is an absolute must read.
0393317552|5.0|This is stuff that should be taught in elememtary school. Seriously. There are so many educated adults that have no knowledge of WHY the world has developed in the way it has. This book will change your world view. I don't know what these negative reviewers are talking about. Aside from some dense technical areas (plant domestication was tough to get through), the book is logical and straight forward. It is not Diamonds contention that geography alone shaped the world, and the book is not biased. I hate that term. If you write a book, if you express yourself, yes, you are automatically biased. You are taking 'your own' side over the side that disagrees with you. But, I digress....<br /><br />The book is mind expanding. Buy it.
1878424319|5.0|A \\"feel good\\" book.  I have recommended this book to many friends and they have liked it as well.  The book provides practical suggestions that one can experiment, as its easily executable.  This book provides 4 simple ideas for you to remember in daily life to help you see things more clearly.  It has interesting metaphors that make it interesting.  An easy and worthwhile read.  The Prayers are the end of the book are beautiful and inspiring    [...]
6300182193|3.0|I have seen many versions of Dracula; many have various qualities to recommend them; I cannot understand why so many people gave Langella's performance such high ratings-just because he is so romantic--read the book-Dracula is alluring, tempting, enticing, but not romantic. Langella lacks Lugosi's determination, Jourdan's terror, Palance's strength, and Lee's menace.  Granted a good supporting cast, Anthony Hopkins version of Van Helsing was a spoof--FFC should have been wacked for labeling his abomination \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\". Langella version is ok but not great. <br /> <br />Then again, there will be no definitive Dracula, until I make it!
0767840135|2.0|I will try to make this relatively short.  I have seen a few performances of Cirque du Soleil on DVDs and TV.  Quidam was filmed in Amsterdam and it shows more of an artsy performance then one I figured I would get with Cirque du Soleil.  Also, the performance is subtitled in English (and a variety of other languages) which makes it more difficult to follow and watch.  Overall, I did not like it too much.  I labored through much of the performance wanting it to be over.  The other few DVDs and shows I have seen had much more comedy and breaks in the performance.  Quidam showed a very different view of Cirque du Soleil.
B00002Z88D|5.0|On April 21st, to April 22nd, Metallica had performed a live concert for fans. Metallica performs 21of their greatest hits, but they do this not alone. Accompanying them is...THE SAN FRANSISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. They provide a whole orchestra to go alone with Metallica's raw-Metal edge. They took this concert and turned into an album entitled, S&M. S&M stands for SAN FRANSISCO SYMPHANY ORCHESTRA & METALLICA. Just to avoid confusion, This concert started on April 21st, and finished up in the wee small hourse of April 22nd. This album is just outstanding and it is the best live sounding album I have ever heard. <br /> <br />Disc ONE: 1 <br /> <br />THE ECSTASY OF GOLD <br />  From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. This is just an instrumental piece only featuring THE SAN FRANSISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. <br /> <br />THE CALL OF KTULU. <br />  From Metallica's album RIDE THE LIGHTNING (1984). Finally! Metallica enters with this instrumental piece from their second album. <br /> <br />MASTER OF PUPPETS <br />  From Metallica's album MASTER OF PUPPETS (1986). I shed a tear when I hear this song. Not only because they guys do a great job of it live, but also because it reminds me of Cliff, since the album of the same name was the last Cliff had recorded with his mates. <br /> <br />OF WOLF AND MAN <br />  From Metallica's album METALLICA (1991). Awesome live version. <br /> <br />THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE <br />  From Metallica's album MASTER OF PUPPETS (1986). Both versions are killer. <br /> <br />FUEL <br />  From Metallica's album RELOAD (1997). Awesome version. <br /> <br />THE MEMORY REMAINS <br />  From Metallica's album RELOAD (1997). Awesome live version, with the audience singing along to Marianne Faithful's parts. <br /> <br />NO LEAF CLEAVER <br />  New song. Awesome. <br /> <br />HERO OF THE DAY <br />  From Metallica's album LOAD (1996). When I reviewed the LOAD album, I had stated that \\"Hero Of TheDay\\" was a good song, but the studio version wasn't as good, and that I liked another version of it. This is the version that I love because of the sound that the SFSO brings to it. <br /> <br />DEVIL'S DANCE <br />  From Metallica's album RELOAD (1997). Not as good as the studio version, but just as killer and rockin'. <br /> <br />BLEEDING ME <br />  From Metallica's album LOAD (1996). Not bad. <br /> <br />Disc TWO: 2 <br /> <br />NOTHING ELSE MATTERS <br />  From Metallica's album METALLICA (1991). This is another one of my favorite Metallica songs. Even the live version just gives me the chills. <br /> <br />UNTIL IT SLEEPS <br />  From Metallica's album LOAD (1996). The studio version is better. <br /> <br />FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS <br />  From Metallica's album RIDE THE LIGHTNING (1984). Both versions kick major a**. <br /> <br />- HUMAN <br />  New song. Not bad. <br /> <br />WHEREVER I MAY ROAM <br />  From Metallica's album METALLICA (1991). Both versions are outstanding. <br /> <br />THE OUTLAW TORN <br />  From Metallica's album LOAD (1996). Not bad. <br /> <br />SAD BUT TRUE <br />  From Metallica's album METALLICA (1991). Awesome. <br /> <br />ONE <br />  From Metallica's album ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL (1988). I love this song like you wouldn't believe, but the video still scares the everloving sh*t out of me. <br /> <br />ENTER SANDMAN <br />  From Metallica's album METALLICA (1991). Still a rockin' tune. <br /> <br />BATTERY <br />  From Metallica's album MASTER OF PUPPETS. Ending the show with a song from their last album with Cliff Burton was the perfect touch. They perform this more than just outstanding. <br /> <br />     I have always wanted to hear and see Metallica live. I still have yet to see them live and I am dying to see them live, but this album gave me the chance to hear them live in concert and they sound phenomenal. To the guys of Metallica, if you are reading this now, you guys kick f*cking ass. You guys continue to make all of us fans proud.
B0000931OG|4.0|I came to this recording via Gorillaz and I'm glad I did. I have tried to give Blur a trial listening a few times in the past but always walked away scratching my head wondering what all the hype was about. Thier music always sounded so pop-ish and superficial.<br /><br />But after Demon Days I was forced to give Blur another try, this time with Think Tank. There is hardly a bad track on ithis record; the hooks are cleverly layered yet deceptively simple and the production is as good as it gets.<br /><br />A nice transition for Gorillaz people, me thinks.
B00000FCBC|4.0|In 1998, Metallica released ninth album entitled GARAGE, INC. This album contains all cover songs from bands back in the 70s & 80s. This album is actually a 2-disc set, where the second disc features the same five songs from THE $5.98 LP-GARAGE DAYS, only Metallica had included eleven more cover songs they have recorded back in 1984, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, & 1995. To make a long story short, the second disc is actually a part of this whole album. <br /> <br />Disc One: PT. ONE-NEW RECORDINGS '98 <br /> <br />FREE SPEECH FOR THE DUMB <br />  Originally recorded by DISCHARGE. Not bad. <br /> <br />IT'S ELECTRIC <br />  Originally recorded by DIAMOND HEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />SABBRA CADABRA <br />  Originally recorded by BLACK SABBATH. I hate it because I hate Black Sabbath & Ozzy Osbourne. I have always hated Ozzy and I'll die hating Ozzy. <br /> <br />TURN THE PAGE <br />  Originally recorded by BOB SEGER. Not bad. <br /> <br />DIE, DIE MY DARLING <br />  Originally recorded by THE MISFITS. Now, this is more like it. I am quite fond of THE MISFITS. This title would also make a great title for a horror novel. Hopefully, it will become a novel and if it does, I hope Stephen King, my favorite author, writes it. <br /> <br />LOVERMAN <br />  Originally recorded by NICK CAVE & THE BAD SEEDS. Not bad. <br /> <br />MERCYFUL FATE MEDLEY: SATAN'S FALL/CURSE OF THE PHARAOHS, A CORPSE WITHOUT A SOUL/INTO THE COVEN/EVIL <br />  All songs originally recorded by MERCYFUL FATE. This whole Medley is just outstanding. My favorite is actually \\"Into The Coven\\" because it seems to describe Witches and I love reading up on Witches, Warlocks, Satanism, and Ghosts. <br /> <br />ASTRONOMY <br />  Originally recorded by BLUE OYSTER COLT. BLUE OYSTER COLT is not a bad band, although, they did have many songs that pretty much bombed. They were one-hit wonders with the biggest selling hit, \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\". For me, they were two-hit wonders. I loved \\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\" andthis song. Metallica does it incredibly well. <br /> <br />WHISKEY IN THE JAR <br />  Originally recorded by THIN LIZZY. Not bad. <br /> <br />TUESDAY'S GONE <br />  Originally recorded by LYNYRD SKYNYRD. I hate this song and I hate Lynyrd Skynyrd. <br /> <br />THE MORE I SEE <br />  Originally recorded by DISCHARGE. Not bad. <br /> <br />Disc Two: Pt. 2-GARAGE DAYS RE-REVISITED 1987/GARAGE DAYS REVISITED 1984/B-SIDES & ONE-OFF'S 1988-1991/MOTORHEADACHE 1995 <br /> <br />HELPLESS <br />  From Metallica's album THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. Originally recorded by DIAMOND HEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />THE SMALL HOURS <br />  From Metallica's album THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. Originally recorded by HOLOCAUST. Excellent. <br /> <br />THE WAIT <br />  From Metallica's album THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. Originally recorded by KILLING JOKE. Amazing. <br /> <br />CRASH COURSE IN BRAIN SURGERY <br />  From Metallica's album THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. Originally recorded by BUDGIE. Not bad. <br /> <br />MEDLEY: LAST CARESS/GREEN HELL <br />  From Metallica's album THE $5.98 EP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED. \\"Last Caress\\" & \\"Green Hell\\" originally recorded by THE MISFITS. Not bad. <br /> <br />AM I EVIL? <br />  Originally recorded by DIAMOND HEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />BLITZKRIEG <br />  Originally recorded by BLITZKRIEG. Not bad. <br /> <br />BREADFAN <br />  Originally recorded by BUDGIE. Not bad. <br /> <br />THE PRINCE <br />  Originally recorded by DIAMOND HEAD. Damn! This is the fourth song they have covered from Diamond Head. <br /> <br />STONE COLD CRAZY <br />  Originally recorded by QUEEN. Now, they're getting to the good stuff. Queen is an excellent band, just like this song. Metallica does such a great job on this song. If he was able to, Freddy Mercury's ghost might come back and actually congratulate Metallica for doing such a great job with covering his song. <br /> <br />SO WHAT <br />  Originally recorded by THE ANTI-NOWHERE LEAGUE. My favorite off of this album. <br /> <br />KILLING TIME <br />  Originally recorded by SWEET SAVAGE. Not bad. <br /> <br />OVERKILL <br />  Originally recorded by MOTORHEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />DAMAGE CASE <br />  Originally recorded by MOTORHEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />STONE DEAD FOREVER <br />  Originally recorded by MOTORHEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />TOO LATE TOO LATE <br />  Originally released by MOTOR HEAD. Not bad. <br /> <br />     This album is a much better improvement of THE $5.98 LP-GARAGE DAYS REVISITED, since they have covered better songs than they did on the G.D.R. album. So, pick up a copy of Metallica's best cover songs.
B000024D4R|5.0|Even critics should not accuse Pink Floyd of being mundane.  At their weakest Pink Floyd is merely good, but often good is better than everyone else.  This album might fall short of the ground-break albums \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Ummagumma\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" but it is still an interesting concept album that required the talents of Roger Waters and David Gilmour to execute.<br /><br />The concept of this album is based on George Orwell's satirical novel \\"Animal Farm.\\"  Because the opening and closing songs are at exactly 1:25, and the three middle tracks range from more then 10 minutes to just over 17 minutes the album is not radio friendly.  The album was released in 1977, and given the sophistication of musical and lyrical composition in combination with the ascendancy of disco and punk; the album was commercially doomed from the beginning.  Fortunately, those of us who are fans of Pink Floyd know quality music when we hear it, and the album has enjoyed continued sales for several decades, surpassing many intentionally commercial albums.<br /><br />Because of the thematic nature of the songs, it is easier to discuss these songs based on their intent.  The \\"Dogs\\" are opportunists, trying to fit in and looking for the easy kill.  While the dogs might appear to be in control, in fact the pigs are using them, and will never know it until it is too late.  Roger Waters depicts the \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" as those in control, with a number of political references.  The \\"Pigs\\" are unpleasant, putting up a front to cover their insidious characteristics, which mostly involving manipulating others to their hidden desires; more discussion on the pigs shortly.  The \\"Sheep\\" are the silent majority, letting the dogs push them about at the whim of the pigs.  Unfortunately, the dogs are eventually eliminated to reveal the true masters, the pigs, but by then it is too late, the pigs are firmly in control and there is nothing the sheep can do but stay out of their way.<br /><br />Unfortunately for us, it seems there are few musical groups willing to take on the heady philosophical depth that Pink Floyd mastered in this album.  I consider any group, rock or otherwise, that takes on such a high concept as the highly regarded novel \\"Animal Farm\\" to be sophisticated and progressive.  Even more interesting, the music is enjoyable with an excellent combination of guitars and keyboards that make these compositions some of Pink Floyd's most balanced music.<br /><br />I will warn you that you need to be in a contemplative mood to listen to this music.  The lyrics and the music are dark, and may call to mind every paranoid thought you have ever had.  The references to those who would manipulate us, whether it is the White House, Congress, or big business, are hardly veiled.  Our role is all too well defined also, whether we aid those who would manipulate, or whether we allow ourselves to be manipulated.  Roger Waters' lyrics are quite cynical and satirical, and he does not hesitate to punch, and punch hard.  The somber music follows the punches, though dirge like and solemn, as though we are being marched to a gallows of our own making.<br /><br />Is \\"Animals\\" high brow?  I suppose that depends on your definition of \\"high brow.\\"  The concept is deep and dark, and may cause some people to lay awake too late at night thinking about the lyrics if you read them too long.  Or you may need to get up to spin the CD just one more time to remember a particular set of guitar chords or keyboard strokes.  There are those of us that think music is sometimes supposed to make you uncomfortable and wonder whether you are manipulated, or worse, make you wonder if you do not care that others are being manipulated, or worst of all, whether you are a manipulator.  I hope you learn a lesson from this powerful music, and if you are an animal, I hope you are not a pig, a dog or a sheep.way. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for us, it seems there are few musical groups willing to take on the heady philosophical depth that Pink Floyd mastered in this album.

B000002HRE|4.0|In 1997, Metallica released their eighth album entitled, RELOAD. This album is a better improvement over LOAD, but still not quite as good as the others. The album does give a heavier sound than that of LOAD, with a bit more likeable songs. <br /> <br />FUEL <br />  Great song. In 2003, when MTV held their next episode of ICON, they honored Metallica. Avril Lavigne was one of many artists who showed up to the show to perform. Many of these artists would be performing many of Metallica's greatest hits. Well, Avril had performed this song. Now, I cannot stand Avril Lavigne. But the way she did this song was just incredible. James Hetfield had even said that, \\"...Hearing a girl sing my lyrics was just amazing...\\" <br /> <br />THE MEMORY REMAINS <br />  This was one of the songs that made me the big fan I am today. The first being \\"The Unforgiven\\". If you listen closely to the voice singing the, \\"Na da da da da da da\\" lyrics is actually Marianne Faithful. I do not like Marianne Faithful, but the way she ad-libs to those words I just mentioned really adds to the song. <br /> <br />DEVIL'S DANCE <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />THE UNFORGIVEN II <br />  This was not a bad sequel to 1991's \\"The Unforgiven\\", but I still prefer the first recording. <br /> <br />BETTER THAN YOU <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />SLITHER <br />  I freak out when I hear this song because the word \\"Slither\\" applies to what snakes do and I seriously hate snakes. <br /> <br />CARPE DIEM BABY <br />  The title is what made me want to hear this song and I'm glad I did. This song kicks a**. <br /> <br />BAD SEED <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE <br />  Should have been the theme to the 1998 sexual film, WILD THINGS, starring Matt Dillon, Denise Richards, & Neve Campbell. <br /> <br />PRINCE CHARMING <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />LOW MAN'S LYRIC <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />ATTITUDE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />FIXXXER <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />     As I said, this album isa much better improvement over LOAD. On the LOAD album cover, you have seen it as the combination of Cow's Blood mixed with the Sperm of an Aid's Victim. Well, for the RELOAD cover, you'll see the mixture of Ketchup & Mustard. Not a bad album, but a better improvement over LOAD.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|By the time the 1980's had arrived,disco was slowly dying out,and hard rock was still popular. At that time,it was hard to tell what the musical scene of the 80's would be-but by the year 1980,even though they had put out less than five albums,Van Halen had already become one of the most succesful bands around,and their first album,along with AC/DC's classic BACK IN BLACK album,is known as the other album(the first of those two albums being BACK IN BLACK)that saved rock-and killed disco. So,how did Van Halen's first album of the 80's meausure up? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This album,while it was not one of Van Halen's most popular albums,is definitely one of their best albums. To be honest with you,the first time I heard this album,I wasn't impressed. I had to give this album a few listens before I liked it-and why is that? The answer to that question is because it is different from Van Halen's other albums-but that doesn't mean that it's a bad album. It's NOT a bad album. It finds Van Halen experimenting with legendary blues music-and doing a great job at it! The opening track for this album,AND THE CRADLE WILL ROCK(which was actually the only hit off of this album,from what I read)is like a declaration FOR independence song,and then there is EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!!,which is really catchy and really cool. Those are the only \\"rock\\" songs on this album. The rest is flat,straight out blues/folk influenced music-all of which is really good. Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen,David Lee Roth,and Michael Anthony all put a lot of effort into this album and wrote good,blues influenced songs while in the meantime,they were not ripping off any fulltime blues musicians. As Chris Bickel already mentioned,this album is pretty much David Lee Roth being-well,Diamond Dave-fun,goofy,silly,funny,and,of course,good and talented. The rest of this album measures up pretty well-some of the songs on here tell stories.I don't want to give away everything,but here's two examples examples of the blues influence this album has and how Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen,David Lee Roth,and Michael Anthony threw in their own twist and own ideas of music and mixed it in with blues-TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME is the simple story of a relationship between a man and a woman and the girlfriend/wife wanting her husband/boyfriend to put his whiskey away so He'll be,let's say,\\"good\\",while in the meantime,the closing song,IN A SIMPLE RHYME starts off as a really nice accoustic instrumental,and then it sings about a special girl with maybe \\"powers\\"(if You listen closely to the lyrics of the song You'll know what I mean by that)-and don't forget to mention that it ends sounding like a Black Sabbath instrumental-how cool is that? Very cool! <br /> <br />Overall,a really good CD. When you put this CD on for the first time,don't go into it expecting an Eric Clapton album or a B.B. King album,and don't go into it expecting it to be VH1 or FAIR WARNING either. Expect a blues/folk influenced Van Halen album with good lyrics,music,and stories with the songs,and you should like this album a whole lot. <br /> <br />P.S.If you read my review of VHII,ignore the one section of that review when I said to avoid this album if you were/are new to Van Halen-I just wasn't into this album when I wrote that review,I like it now,and I'm very grateful to have it,especially since I was lucky enough to get a copy of it on vinyl). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Here Edward Norton proves again that there's no loyalty among thieves, offs the beloved Donald Sutherland and tries to murder the \\"wrecking crew\\" of Jason Statham, Mark Wahlberg, and others.<br /><br />Charlize Theron, not really used as she is capable, plays Sutherland's daughter who joins the remaining group to repay Norton for killing her father a year later and two continents away. Several times the caveat 'it's not about the money' is repeated, which is important lest we forget that these are honorable thieves, not, well, dishonorable thieves. Reminds me of the old legal axiom, \\"when the lawyers tell you it's not about the money it's about the principle . . . . it's about the money.\\" I mean Hell. It's 35 million dollars!<br /><br />Anyhow, \\"The Italian Job\\" has Theron who as always does a credible job with what she's given and is drop dead gorgeous while she's doing it, Statham who is just as tough as they come and like Dominic West (\\"The Wire\\") a credit to his British Roots, and Mark (\\"I am not Matt Damon and I am much better than Matt Damon\\") Wahlberg, who does a good job as the leader of the pack and chief retributionist.<br /><br />The drawback (and it's a fun show) is that there is little feeling to it. You know Sutherland is sponsoring Wahlberg to be the best thief in the world, but we don't know why. Wahlberg et al. travels 5ooo miles to Hollywood and brings the four remaining gang members, with cars, motorcycles and connections to avenge Sutherland, but we don't know how he gets the money to do so (he lost evrything in \\"the Italian job\\") or why. Charlize doesn't like Wahlberg but after awhile, she still seems unenchanted with him. And Norton is an evil, murdering bad guy . . . . at least they tell us that but it doesn't seem to come across.<br /><br />It's like the \\"Bourne\\" movies with Damon, kind of the same in the sense that they are big on retribution and have great cinematography. There's feeling there; there isn't here. 4 stars. Larry Scantleburylebury
B000000WA4|5.0|I remember being at the young age 7 of when I first saw the video for Tonight, Tonight. I also remember that same year, my father and I buying this album. It was pretty much the first album I had ever seen, little did I know 9 years later, it would still be one of, if not my favorite cd of all time. A few years later, I remember hearing a song called \\"Eye\\" by The Smashing Pumpkins. After listening to that song atleast 500 times, I went looking for Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, I pretty much searched my entire hosue for my copy of it, sadly though I never did find it. However, I remember when I did buy it ( within a week of turning my house upside down) I remember sitting up at night before I went to sleep and in the dark lay in my bed and listen to this wonderful double album, which I still do. THis album holds many of my younger childhood memories. Now, enough for my emotional babble about my life and onto what I think of this incredible album.<br /><br />From the start of the intro/insturmental \\" Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" you will realize you're in for a masterpiece. Every track represents something. Nothing is filler all 28 tracks are good in their own way. Even the artwork from the cover to the booklet down to the happy face on the \\" Dawn To Dusk\\" disk and the sad face on the \\"Twilight To Starlight\\" disk. I actually think one day the lyrics to this album could be made into a short poetry book of their own, they all come across as heartfelt and they even come across that way in Mr. Corgan's vocals. I don't care what people think he is one of the best vocalist I have ever heard and being a guitarist myself i think he is truly incredible the same goes for James.Jimmy is one of the best drummers I have ever heard and even though i'm not a drummer I truly respect his craft. Even though I have never picked up a bass in my life I truly enjoy D'arcy's work. I would give a personal run down of the songs but being that there are 28 I would run out of room. Also, I think this album alone destroys anything nirvana ever wrote no offense to them but I think they should never be compared to The Smashing Pumpkins because The Smashing Pumpkins just seem to be better musicians ( remember this is just an opinion) Picking a few favorite tracks is tought but if forced i'd say, Tonight tonight, Jellybelly,  Here is no Why, Thirty-Three, In the Arms of Sleep, Stumbleine and my personal favorite \\"To Forgive\\" the first time I heard it I cried, whenever I have a tough time I just put this song on. THis double album has a few things, emotion power and intelligence. It is still that nearly a decade later, buy this. Enjoy.t of room.

0525457585|5.0|It is with infinite sadness that I discovered some time ago about Michael Ende's passing away several years ago. His fun and lively \\"Jim\\" books (fantasy books containing a black boy as the main protagonist, something unusual even today), and the simple, deeply imaginative \\"Momo\\" were some of the first fantasy books I have read. Then, in my teen years, I read \\"The Neverending Story\\". Like everyone else, I saw the movie first, at age 9 or so. But I had known Ende's work beforehand, and knew that I will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The NeverEnding story is a work of deeply haunting, surrealistic fantasy. Don't expect your friendly hobbits and wizards here (not that there's anything wrong with them!) Ende's father was a surrealistic painter, and his son appeared to have been influenced by his vision. His books are more like fairy tales than the carefully structured worlds and characterization in the books of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis (the other two early fantasy masters), and are likewise influenced by Eastern myths, not only Western ones. Ever wondered what is the child Empress? Well, the beauty of Ende's work is that he leaves many questioned unanswered, much like in the ancient fairy tales. But to know the answers, dig a little into Eastern myths of India. (Bigger hint: watch Bill Moyers' famous interview of Joseph Campbell.)<br /><br />Bastian's journeys through Fantasia, first through Atreyu, then, in the considerably darker and more powerful second half of the book, on his own, are journeys of self-discovery. He tastes not only the delight of losing himself in his imagination, but the profound danger of literally \\"drowning in fantasy\\", receiving everything he ever dreamed of. He falters and almost fails, but the loyalty of his clear-sighted friend saves him, and he receives the deepest wish of his heart. (In many ways, Atreyu is the hero of the story, and Bastian is actually a sort of anti-hero, something unusual in children's books.)<br /><br />Ende's world is the neverending world of imagination. Thus, unlike the world of Middle Earth or Narnia, which are constructed around \\"complete\\", structured worlds, it has no limits, containing all the creatures humankind ever dreamed of. Some readers complained about the brief introduction and then dismissal of the many fantastic creatures populating Fantasia (note- I use the spelling of the translation I read, which is not English). However, this is part of the profound enchantment of the story. These creatures do not fit into a careful hierarchy, are not \\"characters\\" in the classical sense of the word. Instead, they weave the mysterious and semi-surrealistic tapestry of the world that Bastian must traverse in his journey for self-discovery. For me, this is the beauty of the book. I never liked knowing too much about Tolkien's Middle Earth, for example; fitting it into a specified world view which I do not share ruined it for me somewhat. Additionally, some of the mystery, and thus the power of the fantasy, is lost forever when the mechanics of the world are explained. Ende's work remains powerful because of its mystery, even its surrealism. It is a modern fairy tale in every sense of the word, and a deeply moving one at that, on par with the best fantasy written.is the neverending world of imagination.

B000002HAJ|5.0|This is considered by me their masterpiece. I know there are more famous albums, some of them have better songs (A Forest, or Plastic Passion, or Lovesong for example) but I think no Cure album is consistently good as this one. I really have a problem in finding one song which I rate below 7, and that's a rarity in almost every CD I buy. So, whenever I find a CD like this, I rate it 5 stars because it's really something to listen to. Add to this the fact that in this album the Cure drop their commercial side (like they had already done in the previous album, Disintegration) to play a more \\"rock\\" type of music, with distorted guitars substituting synthesizers. Unfortunately recently they returned to a more commercial type of music, so this is a record that probably represents their highest level ever (I hope the old Robert Smith will deny this with an even better record in the future, of course!). <br />I think all the songs are really good, with peaks reached by \\"Open\\", \\"Doing the unstuck\\", \\"From the edge of the deep green sea\\". Conclusion: buy it if you like the Cure, but buy it also if you don't know them and don't know where to start from. It's one of their easiest record but at the same time it's not commercial at all, and I think that's a good achievement.
0385312083|5.0|So it goes. Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, hopping from one of his life's moments to another at random. He is an old man, then he is a young man. He welcomes his son home from Vietnam right before he goes off to fight his own battle in World War II. Billy Pilgrim is dead but then he is alive again.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim has seen and done it all. He has fought in a war, he has had a family, he has befriended the reclusive Kilgore Trout. Billy Pilgrim has been to New York. He's been all over Europe. He's even been to the planet Tralfamadore where he and a beautiful Hollywood starlet were exhibits in the Tralfamadorian zoo.<br /><br />Through it all Billy Pilgrim remains the same humble, mild, and good natured man he has always been. Billy Pilgrim is many things. Sometimes strong, sometimes week. Sometimes clever, sometimes as dull witted as a box of rocks. Only one thing remains constant with Billy Pilgrim. He is always likeable.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|\\"Ghostbusters\\" came out in the summer before I started Junior High school and I remember being such a geek about that movie. The first time I saw the trailer, it was during the film \\"Romancing the Stone\\" and I remember my brother covering his eyes because he got scared, but when they showed Bill Murray, I knew it was going to be funny. This film is a classic, with many lines my friends and I endlessly quoted during our 7th grade year (\\"okay, who brought the dog?\\", \\"does anyone want to play parcheesi?\\", \\"are you the keymaster?\\", \\"I think this building should be condemned\\", \\"there's something strange about that man\\", etc). <br /> <br />Bill Murray made this movie with his detached and dry sense of humour. When this film came out in 1984, it did something that really hadn't been done before...a merging of a supernatural ghost story with SNL-type comedy to brilliant effect. Imagine what could be done with today's CGI-effects if they \\"remake\\" or \\"reinterpret\\" this film? Though it probably wouldn't be the same. It might be better in some ways, but the comedic chemistry between Bill Murray, Ivan Reitman, and Dan Ackroyd made this film as great as it is. <br /> <br />Such a huge fan of this film that I was, when the sequel came out five years later, I had never felt such excitement over a movie's release before (such feeling was surpassed when \\"The Phantom Menace\\" came out in 1999, however). At the time, I loved the sequel just as much as the original, but in later viewings, I realized that it simply doesn't hold up well as time goes on. There was little reason to make the film other than for the money they expected to roll in, which didn't. The sequel made half as much as the original, which is just as well, since it was only half as original in its plot/story. <br /> <br />What is the story? The film is about a group of fraudulent academia scientists who lose their university jobs over bad science (which Bill Murray displays to brilliant comedic effect). They decide to gointo business for themselves when they realize that it is possible to trap and hold ghosts indefinitely. Their business gets off to a slow start but soon they become famous all over New York when they catch ghost after ghost. The plot builds as one case reveals itself to have Biblical, end of the world potential and leave it to a government Environmental Protection Agency bureaucrat to unleash the ancient Sumerian god and its forces of destruction by demanding that the Ghostbuster's ghost containment unit be shut down. Was that 50 foot Marshmellow Man cool or what? <br /> <br />The sequel takes place five years later as we discover that they've been out of business and have been subjects to lawsuits by many people. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) continues his fraud by hosting a Psychic Talk Show and Dan Ackroyd's character runs an Occult bookshop. Strange undercurrents are running through the city, which brings Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) back to request their investigative skills. The Ghostbusters learn that a river of pink slime runs beneath the city and is affected by the vibes of New Yorkers, for good or bad. To repeat the first film's conclusion, instead of the Marshmellow Man to unleash a holy terror on the people, the Ghostbusters bring to life the Statue of Liberty to inspire the people to good vibes in order to defeat the spirit of Viggo the Carpathenian (ruler of Moldavia) from possessing the body of Dana's baby. Kooky! <br /> <br />Like I said...what they could do now with CGI and a great script! Perhaps M Night Shyamalan can \\"reinterpret\\" a new \\"Ghostbusters\\" for the 21st century. The possibilities are endless. Until Hollywood gets whiff of that idea, I guess these two films will do for now. I look forward to owning them on DVD finally (to replace my worn out VHS copies) and I know I'm risking it by buying the dvd now because I still think they are going to re-release a fully loaded dvd later down the line. Should you buy now or wait? I guess it depends on how much you love this film and how many times you plan to watch it.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Even with some lukewarm reviews, \\"X&Y\\" is, in my humble view, the best of the three studio albums Coldplay has released. Coldplay has ventured new elements in their songs, in which the guitar riffs and vocal styles are somewhat U2-like, as some reviewers have pointed out. At the same time, the album still has the basic features of Coldplay that make them popular in the first place. <br /> <br />The upbeat songs really shine on \\"X&Y\\". The first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\", in fact, is a bad presentation of what this album sound like. It is one track that has the most \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" style, though, and it is quite brisk and enjoyable. The true brilliant tracks are the gorgeous and sophisticated \\"Square One,\\" the rhythmic \\"White Shadows,\\" and the energetic, fast-paced (in the Coldplay standard) \\"Low.\\" The three songs would already make the purchase worthwhile. <br /> <br />The ballads are not as stunning but have their moments. \\"Fix You,\\" a future single release, is one of the center pieces here. \\"What If\\" is the typical kind of ballad which Colplay masters, and \\"A Message\\" has country music flavors in it. <br /> <br />What hinders me from giving the album five stars is that a number of songs are too repetitious. Especially in the later half of the album, some tracks are pretty lackluster, obvious fillers. If Coldplay wants to be as critically acclaimed as some of their predecessors are, perhaps they need to make more efforts on the song variety. <br /> <br />Still, \\"X&Y\\" is already impressive from Coldplay. Listen to it more times, and it would eventually grow on you. It is recommended for people who are newly introduced to Coldplay, too, since it is relatively the more upbeat and less sleep inducing compared with the other two albums.

0385513755|4.0|If you're going to read the Da Vinci Code, you might as well do it the right way, with this edition.  All the photos and illustrations go a long way towards helping you grasp exactly what he's talking about.  I simply can't imagine reading the book in any other format.  The discussion of the artwork in the book is perfectly complimented by the actual pictures with this edition.  Photography of the many different locales makes it even more interesting and ultimately adds another dimension to the novel that the regular version could not attain.<br /><br />With Brown's fascination of making the line between fact and fiction blurry, the illustrations merely pronounce the author's angle.  There could have been some more pictures of a few of the locales that didn't have any representation outside of the text, but you feel like you have enough to help you see where Brown gets his fanciful ideas from.<br /><br />Aside from the pictures, what about the plot?  I can't possibly say anything that hasn't been said already.  It's an intriguing plot that won't let you put the book down . . .<br /><br />But I found that half-way through the book, this becomes almost a parody of itself.  The big \\"twist\\" is hardly surprising, my dog could have guessed who the Teacher was.  Langdon's long flashbacks to lectures he's given in class and musings about the \\"pagan\\" roots of EVERYTHING are interesting at first, but after a while sound trite and staged, as if Brown is preaching at you through Langdon (which he is . . .).  And as for the ending . . . Dan Brown must have been short on time.  It's hideously stupid, flat, and sappy.  My dog, once again, could have written a better ending.  Perhaps I should give my dog to Dan Brown?  The ending would have been better.  Overall though, despite these shortcomings, I highly reccommend the book because it's an original idea for a novel.  Not too original for a \\"non-fiction,\\" but for a novel, yes.<br /><br />SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER:  If I were to end the book, I would have had Sophie and Langdon find the Grail and Roslin, but never explain exactly what they found to the reader.  I would simply tell that once they found the grail, they were so stunned and stupified as to what they found, that they knew they could never tell the world . . . that they had to do everything they could, make it their life's duty, not to let the world know what they had found.  In my opinion, such an ending really leaves a lot to the reader's imagination and fits in perfectly with the mysterious nature of the scavenger hunt the main characters are on throughout the whole book.  END SPOILER<br /><br />The book is a novel, it is a work of fiction.  So are it's many ideas about art, history, and theology.  It's all very fictional and absolutely absurd, but Brown makes it easy to follow and doesn't make it too far stretched for the layperson.  Those who are educated in Art History and Christianity will find themselves rolling their eyes and laughing occassionally.  So be warned, the more educated you are, the less convincing this book is.  But do not be fooled, this book has intentions that stretch beyond entertainment.<br /><br />But hey, that's just me, I thought the ending was stupid.

B000268QB2|4.0|I was fighting them for a long time. I did not want to like their music but I do. Grreat album! My only complaint is that every song sounds sad.
B0006L5RT2|4.0|This album is not something you'd expect from a guy who studied engineering, was a part of the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo, rode horseback for the Queen and watched over the Queen Mother as she lay in state.  Colorful background aside, it's hard to imagine his reedy falsetto warbling through the streets of Serb villages or recording music in his landlady's bathroom, but that's exactly the way it happened for James Blunt.<br /><br />His voice takes a little getting used to, but the track \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" brings to mind Supertramp's \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" from the Breakfast in America album.  Most of the other tracks display a lot of raw emotion.  Drawing from personal experience, he sings of love, heartbreak, pain, relationships and unattainable romance.<br /><br />The first single \\"High\\" asks:<br /><br />\\"Will you be my shoulder when I'm grey and older?<br /><br />Promise me tomorrow starts with you\\"<br /><br />Other prime tracks are \\"Wisemen\\" the second hit single; \\"You're Beautiful\\" about a love that can never be (watch out for the single, totally unexpected expletive); and \\"So Long Jimmy\\" and \\"Billy\\" which up the tempo just a tad.<br /><br />As the emotionally charged track \\"Cry\\" begins:<br /><br />\\"I have seen peace, I have seen pain,<br /><br />Resting on the shoulders of your name.<br /><br />Do you see the truth through all their lies?<br /><br />Do you see the world through troubled eyes?<br /><br />And if you want to talk about it anymore,<br /><br />Lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder.<br /><br />I'm a friend.\\"<br /><br />After you listen to this album, you'll feel you have a friend in James.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 6, 2005
B0001KL5DA|5.0|The most beautiful and perfect television show of all time.  Hard to believe that a show like this can reach the airwaves considering how empty and gross the majority of our culture is.  I don't even think of this show as a television show.  To me it's art; it's an on-going novel.  I will cry when it's over.

0380789035|5.0|Shadow is released from prison a few days early when he learns that his wife, Laura, has died in a car accident with his former boss.  Numb from the news he heads home to get her affairs in order and attend her funeral. On the way he meets a man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday who warns him that a storm is coming and hires him for a job as a bodyguard. At first Wednesday just appears to be an aging con-man, but Shadow quickly begins to see that Wednesday is not what he appears to be, and is in fact a magic wielding god. Thus begins a trek across the states to enlist help for an impending Spiritual war against the old gods and the new gods.<br /><br />During the course of the book Shadow also experiences many difficulties when he learns that he has, in fact, resurrected his dead wife from the grave with the help of a gift given to him by one of the people he meets along the way. Laura periodically shows up to give Shadow support along with pain as he unwillingly remembers the manner in which she died. This, combined with periodic dreams and bizarre events that occur (and an intriguing cast of characters and Gods), culminates in a fantastic story that will keep you entertained from cover to cover.<br /><br />A friend of mine introduced me to the phenomenal writing that is Gaiman's work. With this book I am a definite fan of his inventive narrative style., and had to immediately begin reading \\"Neverwhere\\" afterwards. American Gods will not disappoint and is something I would probably read again and again in years to come.
B0002858YS|4.0|I think this CD is truly one of better CD's on the market today for those who are into the indie rock, punkish type of music. If you like the songs \\"somebody told me\\" and \\"mr. brightside\\", then you will like the whole CD. They are such great songs.

B000002L42|3.0|Steely Dan finally after many years crept out of the closet of some recording studio and had the lights shined upon them for an extended concert across the country having only toured a couple of times in the past and after many many years out of the public eye with no records they came back to find success again.  ALIVE IN AMERICA is a collection of songs played from various shows on the tour with the sound and performances being top notch and like any good live album a little something here and there is thrown into the mix of some of the songs to make them worthwhile listeners.  Unfortunatley the song choices left a little to be desired.  Hardly anything short of a hit or fan favorite got put on here from the first few albums, albums you'd think that Dan is ashamed of having moved \\"up\\" in the world from rock/pop to jazz fusion.  I was so hoping ot hear Razor Boy, Any World that I'm Welcome to, Change of the Guard or my new favorite King of thw World in a live setting instead of just the later album stuff especially as a way to break things up.  When I heard their live version of Reelin' in the Years the aforementioned songs may as well been left off.  It wasn't the same it was full of piano playing and saxes not the shredding guitars like we've heard before.  Botthisatva is on here too but sounds so neutered (especially the singing, thank God that song has few words) compared to the studio and the napalm version from the GOLD album and boxset it should have been left off as well.  It's almost as if Dan is reinventing those older songs for their new tastes.  Eeeew.<br /><br />The album isn't a total loss though.  The later albums stuff is as good as it always was.  Josie has an awesome instrumental at the end and Aja as the closer is appropriately fantastic, though relatively the same.  Is ALIVE IN AMERICA worth a purchase, well thats your call to make I'd say put the money toward their box set instead if you don't have it already.  If it's already sitting on your shelf, then ALIVE is money only decently spent.helf, then ALIVE is money only decently spent.
B000063DI9|5.0|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is Maiden's most complete album overall. Some of the other classic releases such as Piece of Mind (which I feel is a superior album) have fillers such as Quest for Fire, but Seventh Son of a Seventh Son doesn't have anything close to a filler. This is also a concept album as many reviewers here have stated (meaning the whole album is actually a story), but the plot is difficult to follow at times. Down to the music, this is another classic album, and the last of the Golden Years. \\"Moonchild\\" is another excellent opener that is up there with \\"Prowler\\", \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"Aces High\\", and \\"The Wicker Man\\". Synths are used a lot in the opening of the song, but then the song goes into the usual Maiden gallop. \\"Infinite Dreams\\" is a Maiden classic. This track is Maiden at their best both lyrically and musically. \\"Can I Play with Madness\\" is one of the big hits off of this album. I'm not a big fan of this song because I feel the mood on this song doesn't match the rest of the album. The next track \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" is another classic. This track has some excellent vocals from Bruce and some great guitar work. The title track is the big epic off of this album. Synths are used a lot in this song, most noticeably in the intro. This is also the song where the Seventh Son is finally born (referring to the story line). The following track, \\"The Prophecy\\" is another excellent song that is underrated. It has a memorable guitar riff and a nice soft instrumental piece in the end of the song. \\"The Clairvoyant\\" is another classic that has one the best Maiden choruses. Bruce sings it perfectly, and I really like the way the pace of the song changes a from time to time. The album closes off with \\"Only the Good Die Young\\". This is another excellent track, and the subject matter of the song actually matches the mood set by the song (Iron Maiden tends to get a little to happy with some songs, such as Run to the Hills and Can I Play With Madness).  <br /> <br />This is one heck of a good album. It is the final chapter of the Golden Year Era for Maiden. It is just amazing that Maiden where able to release classic after classic for such a long period of time. After the release of this album, Adrian Smith departed and Maiden went into the Dark Ages and didn't come out for another 12 years. This album is very unique, and when I first purchased it, I didn't think highly about it, but sure enough, it grew on me a lot and has become one of my favorite albums. So go out and buy this album, in fact, buy all the Maiden albums with the exception of a few (No Prayer for the Dying, Fear of the Dark, Virtual XI).
B00005JMJG|3.0|I agree with a previous reviewer--you will either love this movie or hate it. You will either be intrigued beyond belief or bored out of your mind.  <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine has some of the best imagery I've ever seen. Great cinematography, a thought provoking script, and a well rounded cast make it a must see. And although the movie was satisfying to some extent, I have one minor complaint. All of Joel's flashbacks and hallucinations gave me a jarring headache. I thought it took away from the story a little bit, and made it confusing and hard to follow. But other than that--a great romantic comedy/sci-fi.
B000063COX|5.0|This is the album that started it all for Maiden, although this is a different Maiden in almost every aspect. Most noticeably is the band members. There is no Bruce, Adrian, or Nicko. Instead we have Paul, Dennis, and Clive, and of course, Steve and Dave who are the backbone to Maiden and have been with the band in every release. The sound is also different. The classic Maiden from the Golden Years is more epic and lacks any punk influences. This album, with the exception of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", consist of short songs that show some obvious punk rock influences. However, like many other Maiden albums that would follow, this album is excellent. The old lineup was a good one. Bruce is a better singer than Paul Di'anno, but Di'anno has a unique voice and is still one heck of a singer. Clive Burr is an excellent drummer, and Dennis Stratton, well, I prefer Adrian Smith over him by a longshot. Down to the music: this album is full of good music. \\"Prowler\\" has one of the most memorable 'Wa Wa' riffs and has an excellent Dave Murray solo. \\"Sanctuary\\" is a concert favorite and a classic. Its a quick fast-paced song that shows some obvious punk influences. \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" is a slower piece from Maiden, but it's still a good song that prooves Paul Di'anno is a good vocalist. \\"Running Free\\" is another song that is a concert favorite. Its a simple song that starts out with a bass solo/intro and has some simple guitar riffs. Then comes the song that is without a doubt, the best song from both the Di'anno albums- \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". This is one heck of a good song that has great instrumental work that only \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\" comes close to. The following track, \\"Transylvania\\" has one of the catchiest opening guitar riffs I have ever heard. I could sit there all day listening to the beggining of \\"Transylvania\\". \\"Strange World\\" comes next, and its a slower piece that is similar to \\"Remember Tomorrow\\". It's an ok song, but I prefer \\"Remember Tomorrow\\". The next track,\\"Charlote The Harlot\\" is a great track, and the second best track from the \\"Charlot\\" saga (second to 22 Acacia Avenue). If I remember correctly, this is the only song that was solely written by Dave Murray. The debut album closes off with the song \\"Iron Maiden\\", which is a simple song that has a memorable guitar riff, but hey, who would have anticipated back then that this song would have become a must play at every Maiden concert. To conclude, yes, this is different Maiden sound, and it is hard to envision that only a few years after this release Maiden would play complex epic songs such as Rime of the Ancient Mariner. This album is worth your money. If you choose to put this album aside just because Bruce isn't at the helm, then please don't even bother with the other Maiden releases, and first become a Maiden fan before a Bruce Dickinson fan (I am by no means undermining Bruce, I think he has one of the best voices). So have an open mind and purchase this album.
0920668372|5.0|Anyone who thinks this book is \\"creepy\\" needs some help (see reviews of some \\"odd people!). It's a poignant and sentimental journey about the circle of life.  I could not pick up the book and read it to my son when he had cancer (Leukemia), but now that he is cured its something we share. I also read it to my little one (age 5) and when done he has a smile on his face. It's a once a year read (keeps it special).  It's a keeper for anyones library and for those who have a heart. <br /> <br />Michael
0156027321|3.0|As far as books go, I found that this is an interesting read, at least the premise of a young boy trying to stay alive while on board with a tiger certainly seemed intriguing. Like many others, and hopefully I won't belabor the point, I just didn't get the whole idea that somehow this story that the author tells has some majestically religious message of faith. I enjoy spiritual books and love novels the same, but the link just didn't fit in this story. Maybe I just didn't get it, but the high praise others have given to the book kind of made me a little shocked at this notion. <br /> <br />This book does have its uniqueness and personable feel to it, but some parts lack depth. I certainly liked the way the young boy's story comes into being, as well as much of the background about him and his family, but some of the other parts of the writing were unfulfilling. It is a bit detailed in some of the parts, such as the scenes where Pi is learning how to fish, and killing other animals in the sea for survival, but some of these parts are overly graphic. Moreover, the shocking details of Pi's eating habits, as well as the deaths of several of the animals on board the boat were a little excessive. <br /> <br />This read is definitely one in which you must stretch your logic as far as it goes, or at least try to take things as being symbolic in nature. The part with the blind man on the boat, as well as the events on the island that is \\"killing\\" animals seem a bit outlandish. **(Warning: Spoiler)** Later, when the author is being questioned by the two men, and makes up this fantastically detailed and gruesome story involving his parents and the man on the boat, are we to believe that the entire story he tells is only just a symbolic part of the story, and that it was all made up? Sure, it could have been symbolic, but for a writer to tell an entire story for 300 plus pages and then make up another story is as bad as an author ending a story with someone waking up from a dream. The two stories being linked by one of the men seems interesting, but I just felt like this ending could have been so much more. The questioning at the end seems a little strange also, as well as some of Pi's remarks and questions (for instance, what is up with him asking if he can have chocolate cookies repeatedly?) It really seems as though the author was making a concentrated effort to just finish the book abruptly. <br /> <br />Truth be told, I actually found the early part with Piscine learning about religion and faith, and practicing several religions, and his role in his father's zoo to be one of the more refreshing parts of the novel, but this is quickly abandoned about one-third of the way in after the boating accident.  <br /> <br />Overall, this novel is a quick, easy read, and unique in its own right and premise. However, there were too many parts that leave the story as a larger fable than a spiritual and insightful read.  <br />

B000002UJQ|5.0|Recently voted \\"The Greatest Album of the Last 20 Years\\" by Spin Magazine.  I would say it is the greatest of all time.  This album is like all great pieces of art, be it Kubrick films or Dali paintings, the more you give to this album the better it becomes.  It's been over 8 years since release and I cannot remember the last day I did not listen to it, think about it, or talk about it.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album....but give it time and it will go from a great album in your collection to an essential album.  If I were stuck on an island and could only have one thing with me, it would be this album continuously playing.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves movie that is with out a doubt the worse film he has ever made. Keanu was not right for the role and his performance shows that in a real and painful light. Most of the actors are just as bad a he is with only Rachel Weisz, Peter Stormare and Djimon Hounsou giving good performances with the little they had to work with and they do upstage Keanu and the horrible script but even with their great talent, they still can't save this movie from being as bad as it is.  <br /> <br />Thumbs up for the efforts made by Weisz, Stormre and Hounsou but a big thumbs down for the movie itself. Maybe the three of them could work together again in a better movie.  <br />
B00092ZL80|5.0|Going into this, one may wonder (justifiably) what to expect. Bands past their prime?  A sad collection of tired musicians parading out their old hits?  In fact, it is anything but that.  Surprising, in a way, since both groups are missing original and key members.  But not surprising, since both have remained popular for over three decades, and are filled with fantastic performers who have the ability to play and write songs that are anything but easy to transfer from album to stage, and who do it with occasional greatness.  Not every song hits the mark, but there are moments of absolutely transcendant musical enjoyment -- certainly in every single song that the two bands play together -- but even in some of the songs each band plays on its own. <br /> <br />The differences between the bands?  EWF has fewer original members, but really works the crowd, old school in its efforts to involve the audience, and it sounds fantastic.  Chicago is and always has been a musician's band -- complex arrangements and surprising power at unexpected moments -- with the real surpise coming in the times it gets the crowd jumping and rocking.  No single member charismatic in the way that Philip Bailey is in EWF, but as an ensemble that's played with its current line-up for over twelve years it is simply terrific - the sum greater than the parts.  Robert Lamm's voice is a marvel. <br /> <br />As for the beginning and the end of the concert -- when the two bands come together -- unbelievable.  The sound and picture quality on the DVD immerses you in the entire experience in a way that showed how exciting it must have been to be there.  In the finale, there's one hit after another, programmed in just the right order, each building on the last -- giving truth to what a friend of mine said -- 'the best concert I've ever seen.\\"  Arguable, of course, but you can tell that these two groups love playing together, and the grooves they find in each and every song provide an exciting experience,even at home in your own living room.   Buy this if you are even the slightest fan of either group, and you will walk away happy.
0316168815|3.0|i read this book for my english class. <br />i heard SO much about it. it was on OPRAH as one of her favorites.. yadie yadie yadda. <br />the first few chapters were pretty good, sucked me in. but.. after that.. it began to get very slow, <br />i kept reading it, thinking that something GOOD was about to happen, because thats how it seemed. <br />it didnt. <br />i guess its an OKAY book. but, i warn, at times, very very slow. <br />it also flashes back alot into the past, which at times gets a little confussing. <br />its not a bad book though, but, not the best i've read. <br />i wouldnt recomend to teenagers.
1401300901|5.0|As a writer, an English major, a former teacher & person 10-15 years older than Cecelia Ahern, I was incredibly impressed with the insightfulness of Ahern.  She tackled a mature topic of lossing a spouse, putting such a positive spin on it.  Her format was so fresh & creative, it's no wonder it was published.  The flow of her writings keeps the reader involved in the characters lives, wanting to find out what the next surprise awaiting the main character will be.  I can't wait to read her next two novels!  If they are as creative as the first, I know I will enjoy them immensely!
B000063COX|5.0|The cover is definitely comical and most of the lyrics are pretty cartoonish as well, but in retrospect it's easy to see why this is considered a classic debut.  Iron Maiden were never a 'typical' metal band, although as their influence was so great over the following decade it's easy to forget how original they really were amid all the subsequent noise from like-minded outfits. (I won't mention any names so as not to make anyone mad, but Fate's Warning's debut comes to mind.  Oops, sorry.)  Elements of both punk and, more especially, prog are present throughout, seamlessly blended amongst the metallic riffing.  My personal faves are the breakneck instrumental 'Transvylvania' and its quieter proggy segue, 'Strange World'.  Paul Di'Anno's vocals are serviceable given the lyrics (\\"Wherever you are, Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far\\" isn't even the worst) but it's the guitarfest instrumentation that really carries the album.  Hey - - the lead-guitar riff for the opener, 'Prowler', is downright funky, dude.  And not an umlaut in sight.  Good stuff.
B000002J2F|4.0|There are three kinds of Genesis fans: those who like the Peter Gabriel era of the early 70s and shun everything after 1975, when Phil Collins became the frontman; those who like the more professional, focused sound of the Phil Collins era and don't care for Peter Gabriel's Genesis; and then there are those fans who look at Genesis as a cutting-edge group of talented musicians spanning 30 years, with a history of amazing contrasts, some of which were good, others bad. Although I personally think that the band was at their creative peak when Peter Gabriel was the lead singer, I consider myself to be in the third group of Genesis fans, as I am also able to appreciate the work after Gabriel. At the start of their second decade, Genesis had lost every founding member except for two (and was reduced to a trio, with keyboardist Tony Banks and bassist Mike Rutherford splitting guitarist duties in Steve Hackett's absence), and was also drifting more towards a synthesizer-heavy commercial rock sound. However, the band still retained enough of their prog-rock roots to make the transformation an interesting one. Never were the two halves blended as perfectly as they were on Duke, which in my mind makes this album the best of the Trio Years (from And Then There Were Three in 1978 to the mostly regrettable We Can't Dance in 1991). One of the most interesting things about this album is that it feels like an aborted concept album. It's as if the band started to write a very engaging tale about the relationships between people and the media, then abandoned the project, put what they had written so far on a record along with some other songs they'd been working on, and the end result was Duke.  <br /> <br />The album opens wonderfully, with the first three songs, \\"Behind the Lines\\", \\"Duchess\\", and \\"Guide Vocal\\" more or less fading into one another, which given their common subject matter, is oddly appropriate. The opening track starts off with an extended instrumental intro (with just the right touches; I especially like how Rutherford's guitar track comes up about halfway through, and seems to blend in with Banks's electric keyboard and Collins's crisp but energetic rhythm), and then the vocals begin. In keeping with the theme, this song sounds like a study about the characters in a book, and how the reader, through reading about their adventures, shares the pain, happiness, and discoveries of those characters until they become dear friends. Collins's vocals here are a perfect balance between the more quiet and contemplative range (seen in the few songs he sung from the Peter Gabriel era) and the beefy electronic quality his voice was given later in the band's career (as well as in Collins's solo work).  <br /> <br />As the song ends, it fades directly into \\"Duchess,\\" which I like to think of as the first of the album's two centerpieces. This song also contains an extended intro, in which the band expertly employs a trick from earlier in their career: starting with one instrument playing, and then slowly building upon it. By the time Collins has begun drumming in earnest, we come to the real meat of the song, with the vocals and powerhouse drumming of Collins, and the electric piano of Banks overwhelming us in a rush. It's funny, but as the band sings of the rise and fall of a female singer, I like to think of them as also singing about themselves. At first, it's all about writing music for the sake of music, doing what you think sounds good, and sometimes achieving reknown because of this (which was Genesis for most of the Peter Gabriel era, when they revolutionized the concept of the rock concert, something that reached its peak with The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway); then the drive to write music with commercial appeal starts to play more dominantly (\\"too much thinking about the future, and what people might want\\"); then by the end of your run, you're a pale reflection of your former glory. This is made more ironic by the line \\"and then there was the time that she performed, when nobody CALLED for more,\\" since the last album to carry the name Genesis was the forgettable Calling All Stations, released sans Phil Collins in 1997. Regardless of whether or not the band was thinking ahead, the irony today only adds to this song's appeal. <br /> <br />The final piano notes on \\"Duchess\\" transition directly into \\"Guide Vocal,\\" a quieter song which I interpret as the importance of music in most peoples' lives, and how the lyrics of a song can become a mantra. Perhaps the best thing about this song is the presence of only one instrument. Like some early Genesis songs, it's low-key, but still very powerful. <br /> <br />The next song, \\"Man of Our Times,\\" is one of the two on this album written by Mike Rutherford, and even though there's a definite break between this song and the last, it fits in with the people/media theme, exploring the subject of how news reporters (whose job it is to keep the public informed) have now become celebrities in their own right, and what that might do to the quality of the news. Aurally, this is one of the more interesting. Although there is a definite overdubbing of synthesizers, creating a very vibrant sound bed, there are two distinct musical themes that the song keep switching back and forth between. And I especially like how there are moments in the song where Collins's vocals are dubbed underneath the percussion rather than the other way around. <br /> <br />Then we come to \\"Misunderstanding,\\" one of the two songs written by Collins, and one that seems to break the established theme. I like this song, if only for Rutherford's elevated bass track, but it definitely displays the earmarks of just what direction Phil Collins wanted to take the band in. In fact, this is one of the few Genesis songs I've heard played on an AM station! From this song onwards, the themes explored in the first four songs come back every now and then, but they are interspersed between songs like \\"Alone Tonight\\" and \\"Please Don't Ask\\" (the latter of which sounds like a percursor to a few songs on 1986's Invisible Touch). Perhaps the best of these is \\"Heathaze,\\" one of three songs written by Tony Banks. It's interesting to note that Banks tries to make the music match the feel of his lyrics. Rutherford's lazy, drifting bass notes, Collins's low-key drum work, and Banks's little keyboard seasonings almost reflect the descriptions of dry winds, scorched earth, and a general feeling of not belonging. Banks would use this trick again on \\"Cul-De-Sac,\\" a song about the delusions associated with the proverbial fifteen minutes of fame (\\"you know you're on the way out, it's just a matter of time/ You thought you'd rule the world forever/ Long live the king\\"). The icing on this one is the way Banks molds his keyboard tracks into an almost regal fanfare. <br /> <br />Finally, there's the second centerpiece on the album, the two-part Duke's Suite that the album wraps up with. The first part, \\"Duke's Travels,\\" is an 8+ minute instrumental that moves through several phases, all of which sound appropriately enough like travel music. One can almost depict this accompanying a \\"wandering\\" montage in a film. While overall, this sounds more synthetic musically than earlier instrumentals, the band's stunning musicianship still shines through (I especially love the intro, as well as the song's third phase, when Rutherford's guitar jumps to the foreground). It's interesting to note that the last third of this song, as well as \\"Duke's End,\\" reprises music and lyrics from earlier in the album. But it only serves to make the title of the closing track more appropriate, and after the great opener of \\"Behind the Lines,\\" it serves as a fitting end to close the album with snatches of that song's intro. <br /> <br />Overall, the sound is a sharp contrast from the Peter Gabriel era, but it doesn't disguise the fact that Genesis was still a team of excellent, competant musicians and songwriters. Asthe 1980s progressed, the band would gradually cross deeper into the commercial rock vein, but with Duke, they managed to merge their past and present sounds into a masterwork.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|\\"Illinoise\\" is a fantastic album, and I will be attached to it all summer long. I found it a bit more literal and less evocative than \\"Michigan,\\" but still very beautiful and often quite representative of those parts of the state that I know well. <br /> <br />Stevens gets so much sound into a song without overstuffing it.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is a great CD. The more I hear it, the more I like it. My favorite song on here is The Curse. That song alone, is worth the price of admission. I like how Audioslave is evolving. Out of Exile is the best CD I've bought all year!
B00097A5HW|5.0|I never thought that I was going to like another cd from Shakira as \\"PIES DESCALZOS\\" because even tough \\"LAUNDRY SERVICE\\" had a huge hit around the world, I found that album weak and Shakira didn't developed her beautiful and amazing voice very much. <br />Anyway, \\"FIJACION ORAL\\" is a very mixed album. The first single, \\"LA TORTURA\\" (The torture) next to Spanish icon Alejandro Sanz is a very good Reggaeton track. Maybe you are not going to like it very much the first time that you hear it but you're going to end up loving it (that's what happened to me). Following that track you will find \\"OBTENER UN SI\\" a Bossa Nova type song with catchy chorous. The openning track \\"EN TUS PUPILAS\\" is a soft balland which is followed by \\"LA PARED\\", another ballad but with a more beated up chorous. Actually 80% of the tendency of the album are soft songs with some beats but it's very good. The strongest song is \\"ESCONDITE INGLES\\". <br />This album includes something never included on any Shakira album. For the first time she recorded a song not written by her. That song is \\"DIA ESPECIAL\\", one of my favorite songs in the album. The song was written by Gustavo Cerati (Leading singer of Argentina's Soda Stereo). He also sings in the chorous of this song and in \\"NO\\". \\"LAS DE LA INTUICION\\" is a simple pop song but with nice rhythm, \\"DIA DE ENERO\\" is ok, it's actually the song that I like the least but it's ok and the closing track of the album, \\"LO IMPRESINDIBLE\\" is great. The lyrics are good and Shakira delivers the song splendidly. Finally the last two tracks are are bonus. You will find an acustic version of \\"LA PARED\\" and a remix of \\"LA TORTURA\\". <br />I have the dual disc version of this album and I think that the difference on the bonus material is very good. The cd side is the same but the DVD side includes the video of \\"LA TORTURA\\", an interview that Alejandro Sanz makes to Shakira at his house in Miami. The interview takes like 12 minutes and you have like 5 minutes of footage of how the album was made in Shakira's house in the Bahamas. What I like of the DVD is that you can also listen the album and you have the chance to be reading the lyrics on your tv's screen while you play it. You can find the lyrics whether in Spanish or English. This option and the music video are the best from the DVD side. <br />
B000002U9Y|5.0|This is an amazingly underrated album! The stand out tracks on this one would be Remember a Day, which is in my opinion the albums greatest, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, which is a trippy track from Roger Waters, and Corporal Clegg, which is the \\"trippiest\\" song on the album, written by Waters. I would definitely recommend this to any Pink Floyd fan! Also check out \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\"!
0670033375|3.0|I was disappointed.  Too long by several hundred pages.  The problems are set out in the first chapter and could have been dealt with in couple hundred pages. <br />The content is excellent but too long and redundant.  I didn't find any suggestions for applying the examples to current problems.  A livlier tone would have helped.
B000022TSH|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" is one of the best movies of all time directed by one of the greatest directors of all time (who seems to go unappreciated): Roman Polanski. With great performances by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, it's no wonder why this film is a classic. The film is a great example of film noir, and it keeps you in suspense throughout the film. The story for this film is so brilliant that it could beat out almost any modern Hollywood film today. Jack Nicholson plays a detective on a murder case in Chinatown, but only to get caught up in a world full of deceit and corruption.This film has so many great epic scenes, such as the one where Jack slaps Faye for some answers. The ending is one of the best endings of all time.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Reality check: The world we live in is an interactive computer-generated fantasy designed to enslave our minds while machines harvest our body heat for survival. By now the story is familiar, the hype has been raging for months and the wait is finally over. However, die-hard fans of the trilogy might be somewhat disappointed by the saga's middle chapter. For starters, no film can possibly live up to the media hype that precedes its release, i.e., Star Wars: Episode I. Fortunately for Matrix afficionados, the talented Wachowski brothers have more respect for their audience and general moviegoer's intelligence.<br /><br />What's missing is the suspense and tension of Reloaded's predecessor. The narrative is more linear and the element of surprise and mystery is gone. The first hour tends to drag its feet; relatively unimportant characters and conflicts receive too much emphasis while some of the more crucial plotlines such as the machines that are drilling down to Zion and Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving) ability to copy himself, are swept to the wayside. Some of those subplots might receive more attention in the final installment, which in itself leads to another, almost inescapable flaw of any trilogy: the sophomore part plays out like a whole lot of middle with not much resolution and a cliffhanger for a conclusion. However, it does whet the appetite for the eagerly-awaited third film that is due to be released in November. Despite its more disappointing aspects, Reloaded does maintain one of its predecessor's most important qualities; it leaves the audiences thinking.
B000002A3T|5.0|Songs like 'High Hopes', 'Coming Back To Life', and 'Poles Apart' echo the majesty of The Wall and 'Cluster One' acts as an intro similar in effect to 'Shine On'. This is as close as the post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd will ever get to sounding like their old selves, however, they prove that they don't need Waters to make it truly magical. Speaking of magical, check out The Division Bell's live companion, Pulse, which features excellent live versions of \\"What Do You Want From Me\\", \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\", \\"Keep Talking\\", \\"High Hopes\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life\\".
