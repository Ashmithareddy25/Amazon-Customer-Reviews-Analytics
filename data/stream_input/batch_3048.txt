B00CO8TBR4|1.0|I'm sure the processor itself works fine.  I'll figure that out after I buy a new heat sink and fan and install it because the Intel one is a worthless piece of junk.  I've built dozens of computers in my life, never encountered one this bad before.  Can't even get it to actually mount on the processor and lock in place.  If the processor wasn't a couple of hundred dollars maybe I could cut them a brake.  But it was, so no.
B00F9A903O|5.0|Like the title said, i just got this game. It's great! I just CAN'T buy the pretty land or whatever... i can't click the little green check mark...
B00BD99JMW|5.0|WOW! People are really, REALLY upset with this ending. I agree, my heart ached at the end. I'm actually still pretty upset about it. However, considering the hostile world the characters lived in, am I surprised? No.<br /><br />Although I agree that Tris' and Tobias' voices were too similar (I did have to keep checking to remind myself who was talking), I thought the author provided a wealth of lessons in this installment. Aside from the obvious focus on discrimination and prejudice, she addressed bravery, courage, and ultimately, sacrifice. Was it a \\"storybook\\" ending? No, of course not. But, that's one of the things I liked about it. I disagree that it was senseless, I thought it served a very important purpose. The problem with a tragic ending in a trilogy, especially a really engaging trilogy with good characters, is that you become very attached to those characters. It actually feels like a personal loss. However, I think after time, and some objectivity, many fans will come to appreciate Allegiant.

B0000025D0|5.0|I've owned this album for over 30 years and have listened to it countless times. While it's not my favorite Springsteen record, I would put it in the top 5 of his catalog. Recently, I improved upon it by deleting the weak tracks and replacing them with songs from &#34;The Promise&#34; and adding a few more. I've always felt &#34;Factory&#34; &#34;Streets of Fire&#34; and &#34;Something in the Night&#34; were subpar offerings which brought the record down.  The following is the improved version of Darkness that I made: 1. Badlands 2. Adam Raised A Cain 3. One Way Street 4. Candy's Room 5. It's A Shame 6. Racing In The Street 7. The Promised Land 8. Save My Love 9. Because The Night 10. Fire 11. Prove It All Night 12. Darkness On The Edge Of Town  Now whenever I listen to it, it sounds like a fresh album. If Bruce had made this version the official release, it might have been the best album he ever made. By the way, I also did the same thing for The Wild, The Innocent, And The E Street Shuffle.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have never written a review before but this book leaves me compelled to. I loved divergent and insurgent. I loved the story and the characters and re-read them multiple times and could not wait for the last book, to finally find the answers to what was outside the city and what divergence really was and when we finally find out it was a huge let down. I was so bored while reading this, and to find out that all it is an experiment? Being divergent just means your genes are healed?? And I hated the switching between Tris and Tobias. They had no separate voice. I constantly had to go back to try to figure out who's point of view the chapter was. The characters all turned into these people I barely recognized and started to stop carrying about. And Tris dying was solely because Veronica Roth wanted to shock her readers. Tris died for no reason. Her death did not provide a rallying point for them to stand behind, nor did it save lives. The conflict in Chicago was already over. And for her to die by gunshot after surviving the death serum is just ridiculous. Tobias turned into a weak, boring person instead of the mysterious badass he had been. Peter being in this book was just<br />as absolutely pointless as the book itself. I wish I had memory serum to take so I could forget I ever read this terrible story. Someday down the road I'll go back and read the first 2 books and then make up my own ending. I know not every book has a happy ending but it wasn't just the ending that made this so terrible. All I have left to hope for is that perhaps the movies will have a good ending, not the awfulness that was the book version of Allegiant. So very sad.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|It is not as funny as the 2nd and far from as funny as the 1st. and if and why what
B000AP04L0|5.0|I worked at a large company in the health care field for many years and just about every joke in this movie was true at that job!! There were meaningless slogans, focus on pointless things (TPS reports), cubicles, layoffs of people who did good work (Michael and Samir) promotions of people who did nothing (Peter), consultants, I actually had about 3 different supervisors at any given time, and worst of all........no motivation! This movie is hysterical and relatable for anyone who has ever worked in a corporate environment. If you still work there, it will at least help you laugh about it!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game is interesting. I thought it would be like many of the FB games that only allow play for a limited time before requiring you to purchase or request gifts from your FB friends. Which can be an annoyance for you or to those that do not play. Some of the hidden object games I have played have been difficult to play for various reasons.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I don't read, ever! For some odd reason I decided to buy the book on my iPhone kindle app and started reading. 7 pages in and I'm hooked, only E L James would know why and of course all the other Christian Grey fans. I couldn't stop reading, had to force myself to bed every night after reading. I finished the trilogy in a month which I think is pretty crazy because it took me two and a half months to read pride and prejudice in high school. Lol overall, one of the best and no book out there can compare.
B00DGABUIC|5.0|When I saw it in Tumblr I knew I had to have this figurine, as it is expected is not articulable, mini-nightfury design it is proportional, painting is adequate and expression it is so cute. He deserves a special place on your desktop
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to set up.<br />Even easier to use.<br /><br />Nothing to negative to say about this at all!  From the initial setup that walks you through the easy set of instructions, to the flawless operation of the companion app.  I have used the app on Andriod, Apple, Windows, and Linux platforms and have never had a single issue.

B004X80QNG|1.0|The thing I hated was using it with my calender.  I would enter birthdays into the calender and set it to recur once a year and every day it would recur and I tried everything to delete it and reset it but it just kept doing the same thing.  I finally gave up and deleted the whole app.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this game is great. it doesn't take just one day to beat. I will probably. play it again. 5star for me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book great. It reads like the older books with a smooth flow.  It was hard to put down.  It took me a year to read Under the Dome but this book one week!
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Unbelievable story with a great message for kids.  The message of faith and hope in the movie is very inspiring and uplifting.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|The ideas where great. Not my style, but will recommend it to my grand daughter. I really can't say what it the problem is, except the story didn't grab me. I gave it 4 stars because I felt it had a good idea and was well written just not me.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|One of the BEST current Star Trek Movies that has taken the 3D concepts too a NEW level<br />of visually stunning effects.
1616614609|4.0|This is a great game.  I had been trying to buy a copy of it at my local shop forever, and they couldn't keep it in stock for more than 12 hours, so eventually I ordered it online.  It was well worth it.  It takes awhile to get comfortable with the rules, and the asymmetrical nature of the gameplay makes the rules seem like they are overly complex, but once you get past the semi-steep learning curve the gameplay is fast, fun, and strategic.  I would recommend this game to anyone, but avoid trying to teach it to children.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The tragedy here is not just in the ending that the characters faced, but also in what the fans who have waited for this book for so long have had to endure. I loved Divergent - the story, the characters, the world - was captivating. Insurgent fulfilled the \\"middle book\\" role - it had its problems, but it was good enough to keep the story moving and keep me engaged anticipating the finale. But this book...this book shows the age of the author (and I'm not just talking about the ending - the book was an overall mess as many others here have noted) and that she truly doesn't understand the audience that she is writing for or that ultimately writing is a business. I can understand naively wanting to create your vision and be true to the story you want write, but at the same time you have to understand the long term impacts of those decisions - and this is one that I can't help but wonder if she will come to regret in the future. When you have the potential to profit off of three movies and a series of short stories in the future, you need to pay attention to your target audience a bit more as you are depending on their loyalty for the success of these ventures...and after this book, I personally won't be back. I cancelled my pre-orders of the short stories and no longer have any desire to see the movies, so while I may have lost the money I spent on buying this book (although I may yet try and return it), I at least won't waste any money on any of the short stories or movies!<br /><br />So sad as this series truly has so much potential.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the layout and that you can play along with friends. Levels are challenging, graphics are cute, and it seems the game goes on forever.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I am an Iron Man fan, but this last movie almost put me to sleep. Too much talk and not enough Iron Man, though there were plenty of suits. The special effects were good even if they are computer generated.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series was not the normal read for me, but so worth the time and angst that I am thrilled to have been on this journey. Although not always going in the direction I would have hoped, Tris and Four shared a variation of life as we know it that I will forever remember.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The characters in this book are excellent as is the world building.  I'm always fascinated by the amazing ideas Brandon Sanderson comes up with.  I know this is technically YA but I found it very satisfying read.  I cannot wait for the next one!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were amazing! The build up of the characters and story line was fantastic but the third felt like she just wrote something to finish the series. Not accounting for the tragic end, the whole book was so simplistic in its resolution, it also was not very plausible for the characters she has built in the previous two books. I get she wanted to try something different but this was an epic failure. There are too many unanswered questions, too many new story lines introduced and never finished and it was just boring! I found myself just skimming it halfway through just to get it over with. Her characters and story deserved better. It was as if she created an intricate and complicated story but didn't know when to stop and caused a mess of everything so she just cut it off with a quick solution and slapped a bow on it and said &#34;finished!!&#34; Terrible writing and story development, so disappointed.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Im not much for reading, but this book really hooked me and kept my attention mostly throughout the whole thing.  Good read for the upcoming movie.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The book is solid, Moyes is a great writer with some good characters.  Yes, there is a lot of dependence on cliche, but somehow, it works in this book and I could not put it down, or skip through (as I often do with books that I start but don't love). HOWEVER, and here is the spoiler, I really did not like the ending.  I find it kind of morally problematic that Will decides to go through with it, and also, a bit incongruent with his statement that the last six months had been his best ever.  And of course, I read romances for the HEA, and was hoping she would pull off something lovely and different at the end.
B0089LOG02|4.0|It has really made me wonder if there were orphan trains and I loved how the author wove the tales together.  I of course loved the happy ending.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I have a Logitech sound system that I already use for gaming but I wanted something for voice chat that was wireless.  This unit has good range and great sound.  The Bass could be better for sure but overall the unit is sturdy and the battery life lasts me about 8 to 9 hours when in full use constantly.  The headset is comfortable, at least for me and has adjustments that go out pretty far for those with larger melons.  The buttons on the side and the auto mute when the mic is in the up position is great too.  Overall, I like the product.  I just wish the bass was better but I have a sub for that on my other sound system.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so excited for this book to come out after reading the first two books in the trilogy. However, I could not be more disappointed in the way she ended the series. I feel the ending was unnecessary and it completely took away my love for the first two books. Knowing how this ends I have no desire to see any of the movies.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|close your eyes and open your ears...what a great duo.  They shine, and should have a great career for many years to come.
1250030951|5.0|Best book I've read in long time, and it's right up there with 'Saving June', 'Shiver' and 'Fixing Delilah' in my favorites. You really do fall in love with the characters, and I pray the author might consider a sequel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing.  Some reviewers complained about repetitions of words and about Ana's tug of war with her conscience.  There are people who are critical of the series who hasn't even read it.  For me the story far outweighs the problems with the writing style.<br /><br />I've read the series several times now.  FSOG was about two people that knows nothing about relationships try to be together.  I love Ana's character because I can relate to it.  I'm pretty sure I would have at least tried to submit.  Christian's character is very complex.  It gives insight to how abused children can become damaged adults.  I'd like to hope that there are people who would try to work through the problems that come along with being scarred.  Poor Christian didn't understand what he felt for her because he had no point of reference.  Ana had no reason to have low self-esteem but she did.  My favorite part in this book was the trip to Georgia.<br /><br />FSD is my favorite of the series.  It was full of action.  It had me laughing, crying and randy at times.  I loved the incident with Leila in the apartment.  I loved when Christian submitted.  I loved the masquerade ball.  I loved and hated when Charlie Tango went down.  I loved the incident with Jack and Mrs. Robinson.  I absolutely adored his proposal.  I think y pretty much loved everything about this book.<br /><br />FSF was a wonderful ending to this series.  Action packed.  The car chase.  Ray's car accident.  The pregnancy.  Mia's kidnapping.  This series has it all.  How many times have you said thAt would have been a perfect story if only there had been some sex?  This is that story.<br /><br />I initially decided to read FSOG because it was being banned from some libraries.  I wanted to see why.  I'm so glad I did.  Not only did enjoy this series immensely but I started reading for pleasure.  If it wasn't for this series I would never have read so many other great books like The Hunger Games, Graceling, Daughter of Smoke & Bone or The Host, just to name few.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I missed seeing Up in theaters unfortunately, but I did get to see it on dvd after it was released. I bawled many times and was amazed at how only 15-20 minutes of a love story could effect me so quickly. Not only that, but I didn't expect a story about a senior citizen could be filled with so much adventure and fun. I picked up the movie on Blu-ray after showing my 18 month old daughter the Pixar Shorts Collection dvds where she was completely enraptured by Dug's Adventure short. Mix him in with Kevin the bird and the colorful balloons used to move the house across the world, and she loves watching it just as much as my fiance and I do.
0316074314|5.0|It is not often I indulge in a Booker Prize winner  yet the theme of this caught my eye and a few pages in I realised it was a mystery, bound in an enigma, caught in a puzzle. Those readers who love a good \\"whodunit\\", then this is of that ilk; yet, with that plot it is written in a manner that has echoes of Arthur Conan Doyle,  it navigates precisely through the labyrinth of a Victorian-era New Zealand with a tenacity that has  a style at once of a reporter, of a sleuth, and of a pseudo-arcane mystic.<br />It will be difficult to review this book without some spoilers, for that I apologize, and cease reading now if you are a lover of cryptic storylines. However, I shall limit them to as little impact as possible.<br />Eleanor Catton's novel, given her youth, is extraordinary. It commences in a tawdry room on a rain lashed, dark night with the arrival in Hokitia of one Walter Moody. The author sets the tone of her narrative quickly: heavy on description, both physical and character, perturbed in tone, curious in ear. He has come across a s&eacute;ance of men, a gathering of interested parties, a conclave of hubris; maybe, even, a smoking party after a Last Supper. For the first half of this long novel Walter hears the tales from each of the men, leading us to why they are gathered in that place. The author capably shows us how half-heard truths, mistranslations, partial information, flawed personalities...all can lead to a story that, as Reverend Devlin Cowell puts it so very late in the text:<br />\\"never underestimate how extraordinarily difficult it is to understand a situation from another person's point of view.\\"<br />It is precisely this that is the technical pivot of the novel; for without the affair in Hokitia would be as bright and gleaming as the nuggets of gold that are the cause of so much intrigue, murder, despair, reconciliation, failed dreams.<br />I confess about a third of the way in I started to make a note of all the characters, fearful of becoming lost in the turns of the narrative; fortuitously I discovered that the author gives a conclusion to the events that led to the meeting on January 16 by the time we are mid-novel. As I looked around the characters of Aubert Gascoigne (Magistrate's Clerk), Edgar Clinch (landlord of the Gridiron Hotel), Dick Mannering (owner of \\"The Princes of Wales Opera House\\" and various claims), Thomas Balfour (shipping magnate), Reverend Devlin Cowell, Te Rau Tauwhare (Maori friend of Crosbie Wells), Charlie Frost (banker), Joseph Pritchard (local drug emporium owner), Harald Nilssen (commissioning merchant), Benjamin Lowenthal (Jewish editor of \\"The West Coast Times\\"), Quee Long (lone worker on the Aurora mine) and lastly (but not least), Sook Yongsheng (operator of the Kaniere opium den) - all of whom were gathered to discuss both the bizarre death of Crosbie Wells, a  \\"hermit\\" found dead in his house at Arahura Valley, the disappearance of Emery Staines who was the \\"richest man in town, the fate of Anna Wetherell,  a prized whore with Aurora mine stamped gold nuggets sewn in the seam of her dresses, and the strange comings and goings of the barque Godspeed with its villain of a Captain Carver - I saw how the author had based her novel around the concepts of greed, social placement, curiosity and (inevitably in such a small frontier town), six degrees of separation.<br />What follows would not be out of place in a Dickens novel as we work through the plots of all those named above plus Lydia Wells and George Shepard. We have multiple Magwiches, several Pips, a Nancy...with the supporting characters and ambiance you'd expect. What was a delight was Eleanor Catton's dalliance with Victor Hugo. For those who have read his epic tomes, he is much given over to lengthy asides, philosophizing at whim on any topic of the day. Whilst the author has not written a novel to compare with something like \\"Les Miserables\\", she does neatly indulge in such asides, giving us interesting  and thought-provoking monologues on topics such as:<br />On prayer: \\"The prayerful man, the good man, is always hopeful; he is always an optimist. A man is made hopeful by his prayers.\\"<br />On digger's law:  \\"when the savage meets the civil.\\"<br />On whoring:- \\"a whore cannot become respectable. A whore cannot become rich. All the prestige and the profit belong to the whoremonger, never to the whore.\\"<br />On judgement:  \\"For although a man is judged by his actions, by what he has said and done, a man judges himself by what he is willing to do, by what he might have said, or might have done - a judgement that is necessarily hampered, not only by the scope and limits of his imagination, but by the ever changing measures of his doubt and self-esteem.\\"<br />On welfare: \\"Welfare is the very proof of civilization - it is its finest proof, indeed!\\"<br />On love: \\"new lovers would do little more than call to mind the old, and one would be forced to wander, lost, in that reflective maze of endless comparison, forever disappointed, forever turning back.\\"<br />By the end of the novel I was sated and I applaud this Canadian/New Zealander on what she has achieved. It was a novel that made me think, entertained me, encouraged my love of \\"whodunits\\", educated me about an obverse Victorian society in New Zealand. Out of all it, though, came one hard memory of what the novel is all about...<br />\\"an assembly of innocent men - not of schemers, or conspirators, or felons of any kind. / You'll find a fair clutch of men have come out of this business feeling like there's someone to blame.\\"<br />Yes indeed.

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|The first three chapters are very good, knocking over a pillar of neo-classical economics.  From page 53 on it is a failure, beginning with Chapter 4.<br />Chapter 4, \\"What is to be done?\\" is in response to the technological elimination of a massive number of jobs predicted by the earlier chapters.<br />It fails totally, first on the grounds that the 19 numbered suggestions offer only trivial responses.  More importantly, it fails as well because the authors<br />re-embrace the neo-classical economics they have just skewered.  They believe that the market is deciding on the US income distribution, i.e.<br />that people are paid their contribution to output.  Only a well-trained economist from an elite school actually believes that.  The rest of the<br />population knows better.<br />The Kindle edition does NOT include the notes that the printed book has.  A shocking omission.
B00867GK26|5.0|When I first saw Finding Nemo in the theaters I thought of it as good but not as engrossing as other Pixar movies before it. Since then, I met my fiance who loves the movie and wanted a copy of it, which I bought for her in the week leading up to the birth of our daughter in 2012. Now our daughter is 19 months old and points at the TV, looking to us says &#34;Fishies?!&#34; She absolutely loves this movie and after seeing it many, many times over the year it's definitely grown on me as much, much better than I first thought of it. In the last few months we upgraded Nemo to Blu-ray and couldn't be happier for making the switch. My fiance, someone who thought for quite a while that the whole Blu-ray phenomenon was just a cash grab to make people rebuy movies they already owned on DVD, is convinced there's a huge difference and improvement watching not only Nemo but every computer animated movie in high definition. I already agreed a while back, but it helps that we both are on the same page now.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I can only imagine the testarone levels while making this movie!<br />While it's just the typical blow-up action movie, it's enough to get the gang together and complete the mission.<br /><br />Sly and his team aren't the best actors but who cares when you are holding the dynamite.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|[[ASIN:B007Y36K46 John Carter]]One of my very first \\"chapter book\\" sci-fi experiences as a kid was reading \\"The Chessmen of Mars\\" back in sixth grade. The only reason I didn't read the rest immediately was the other books weren't available.<br /><br />Now years later I'm enjoying the rest of the \\"Barsoom\\" series via Kindle, and last year I finally got to see this movie.<br /><br />As my title states, I haven't had this much pulp style action fun since \\"Leauge of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\\" One of the film is different from the books. In several ways that makes it better. The film explains the transition to Mars better than the original story, my opinion.  I loved the larger conspiracy in the film, and best of all, the film's female lead is not only three dimensional as a character, but a vital part of the story.<br /><br />Love sci fi action? go find this film. I would like to see a sequel.
B000FC11A6|5.0|So, I'm probably about 1/5 of the way through the book.  It's mind candy...Stephenson can wield a sentence--from utter disgusting to absolutely hilarious in nature--to slay just about any mind.  His characters are believable because of the insane effort in put into each person's thinking process and quirks.  Although, Stephenson gets a little excessive on Lawrence Waterhouse's thoughts with the added mathemetical and OCD-ish pattern recognition thoughts that come along.  It's been a little slow in progressing thus far, but it's been a good ride.  I hope it keeps up!

This book is packed full of unethical judges, corporate coverup, drug culture, poisonous men, paranormal activity, gang stalking. What more could you ask for? Top it off with a surprise pregnancy, and the question of paternity. This was a devilishly delightful read. It almost seems to set up for a sequel? I sure hope so!
B00EP22QKG|4.0|This album is pretty much what one would expect from a Joan Jett album. She's stayed true to her unique sound. You have the great hooks and sing-along choruses. Then there are those with corny lyrics. The ballad (\\"Everybody Needs A Hero\\") closing the album is plain embarrassing. Many of my friends are choosing \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Different\\" as their favorites. I'm loving \\"Bad As We Can Be\\" and \\"Make It Back\\" which hold more of the classic Jett sound, vs. the \\"mature\\" Jett sound. Joan is keeping up with modern day by writing tracks based on the worlds obsession with reality TV (\\"Reality Mentality\\") and social networking (\\"TMI\\" which would make a great single). The lead single \\"Any Weather\\" is a midtempo sing-along, written with Dave Grohl.
0440237688|5.0|This book was purchased for my son for a school assignment.  It a great book that the rest of my family also enjoyed reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have had some issues with this game, but always customer service is there to help. This is the main game that I play.
B00AEFYXD6|4.0|Not  only  is  the  animation  quirky  and  fun ,  it  also  has  a  serious  real  message  about  water .<br />This  is  actually  well  scripted  for  adults  but  kids  should  be  able  to  follow  it  too .<br />I  also  like  the  soundtrack  but  doubt  the  CD  version  would  have  the  full  score .
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love this game It's so addicted. It's got its ups as well as its downs. But for a free app it's awesome. Can't complain.
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|Started off great, but the bizarre pacing and jumps in the narrative left the show almost unrecognizable by the end if the season.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I came across the song \\"Let Her Go\\" a few months ago thanks to a recommendation from a British vlogger.  After hearing that song, I listened to a few other songs and bought the hole album.  This album is excellent.  Passenger has a beautiful voice, the lyrics are wonderful and witty. It is the opposite of the over-produced pop that currently saturates radio.  The sound is acoustic, gentle but not boring.  It's an album to listen to and savor because it has meaning.  This is literally the best album I have bought in years - filled with real talent and honesty.  Standout tracks are Let Her Go, Things that Stop You Dreaming, Patient Love, Holes, Life's for Living and Staring at the Stars.
B004SC8YH2|5.0|As a kid, I absolutely LOVED his albums in the 80s.  Though their classics now, I was excited to get \\"Doctor Faith\\" in 2011 and immediately started singing to each of the singles.  By the next month, I was travelling to see him perform live and he did not disappoint.  His voice is still as outstanding as it was thirty years ago and of course he remains magic on the guitar.  I highly recommend \\"Doctor Faith\\" because the songs on this CD have so much meaning to them.  My personal favorite singles are \\"November,\\" \\"When You Come Home,\\" and \\"Praying.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An excellent game of strategy and skill. I find myself addicted to this game and play it everyday. Being so entertaining and mind relaxing, i promptly give it a five star rating. I recommend it to everyone searching the app store for free games.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Hilarious fun for the whole family which can be watched again and again and again. Believe me we have! :-)
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I always enjoy Michael Connelly novels, especially Lincoln Lawyer ones, and this was no exception. The character development, the plot twists, the lack of 'gore', the humor - all make for great reading!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I bought this app for my Velocity Cruz tablet.  Though the Cruz is hardly anything to brag about, I thank this app for reviving the tablet's usefulness because the web browser the Cruz came with is lousy.  Dolphin stepped in and worked wonderfully.
B00CY0JY88|3.0|would recommend it to romance readers. i found out i am not of that kind so much. prefer 50 shades.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|From time to time I'm required to log on to amazon app in order to use this program. It is very annoying because I have a long and complicated password that I don't even remember and typing it on a smartphone is not fun at all. I understand that it is probably Amazon's requirement  but bad reviews about that matter would force developers complain too.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|A fabulous Dickensesque adventure! Loved every minute of it. A book destined for greatness. Whatever you do, don't miss out on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't know what people can complain about, this game works perfectly on kindle fires and is so fun to play. I spend so much time on it:) totally worth it!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so much fun and now it has better upgrades, multiplayer, new characters, and even better tournaments.  This game is the best and it is FREE!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|i really enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. the prose was never particularly impressive, but the world that roth created was interesting, the storyline was engaging, and tris was a terrific heroine. unfortunately, the third book sort of fell apart. there's a whole lot of nothing happening while dozens of new characters are introduced, until about two-thirds of the way through the book when the story finally starts to pick up. it then spends a while being pretty enjoyable, until an incredibly disappointing ending. i only skimmed the last few chapters after the big event, because i no longer cared.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I love the Beautiful Creatures series but this movie was HORRIBLE!!  Characters were changed, eliminated or combined.  Evil characters were &#34;good&#34;, important details were left out, scenes were out of sequence and other scenes were added that, frankly, did not add anything to the plot and, just convoluted the story and/or distracted from the central relationship of the two main characters- which, by the way, were casted horrendously.  About 30 minutes in, I wanted to turn it off, but I was curious to see if it would get any worse- and, it absolutely did.  I think the original authors bare some responsibility in that they allowed the writer/director to change so much.  Had he actually successfully interpreted &#34;page to screen&#34;, all of the books in the series could have been major motion pictures- a missed opportunity for the authors.  I'm not surprised it didn't do well in the theaters.  Had I seen this movie in a theater, I would have walked out...
0783231032|4.0|Jim Belushi in this one with a all star case. Great comedy. Great flick. If you have never seen this one you must had been living on an Island or some great reason. Only negative thing I could say about this DVD is the pic is in Wide/thin screen. Meaning if you were to stretch the screen it would still have the upper and lower blackness on the screen, thinner than the other widescreen formats. I couldn't find a full screen version anywhere, so you may not have any other choice. For this is the reason for only 4 stars out of 5.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had the hardest time putting his book down and actually going to bed - just wanted to keep reading more and more!
0399255370|5.0|a 5 year old....&#34;This book is awesome!&#34;  High praise from a 5 year old!!!  I bought this for my grandson since I am trying to cultivate a love for reading.  He really enjoyed this book.  It's funny and a keeper.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Pretty good ending to the series but left me feeling depressed.  I have loved all of the characters in this series, and was really heartbroken by the ending but I understand why she chose to end it this way. I guess I'm just a sucker for a happy ending.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game was fun at first but once you get to a certain level it becomes impossible to get past it unless you sign in to facebook and pester your friends to play so you can get more lives or tickets to skip the level.  I enjoyed the first 20 levels or so but not so much once it gets practically impossible to beat. The other option is to buy help to pass the level and that isn't happening!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Chris Eccleston does not get the credit he deserves for his turn as the Doctor. He helped restart the legend of the Doctor! He was my first doctor so I may be partial, but I think he was fantastic. :)
B0034G4P94|5.0|Great movie.  Love to watch it over and over.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|Hiromi's previous album, \\"Voice\\" is the definitive Album where Hiromi nails her artistic voice and fully expresses it. I discovered Hiromi at a Simon Phillips drum clinic, which was downright amazing. (He's easily one of the 20 best drummers in the world.) Simon modestly suggested his upcoming gig with Hiromi would be a good event to attend. I couldn't make it, but coincidentally 2 days later I met an older couple who were RAVING about the concert. If you love complex melodic jazz, you'll love that album.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Voice,\\" MOVE brings you to a whole new level. Move opens on a similar plane as Voice, but adds new layers of tension and tapestry. As a percussionist, I admire Phillips' adroit performance. The first track showcases each of the three musicians soloing while never leaving the essence of the song behind. There are so many nuances and subtleties to this performance, you could listen 100 times and never stop hearing new things.<br /><br />The recording is superb. If you have an iPod and a nice set of headphones it sounds great. If you have a $10,000 music system, it will sound fabulous.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Love the themes, new levels and the power-ups.<br /><br />The sounds are spot-on.<br /><br />If you could improve on the tutorials somehow, to make the usage of the powers clearer, it would help alot.  Cant always get it perfect.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I've been waiting for this novel for a long time, and all I can say is that I was let-down big time.  The plot was boring at times, convoluted, and had one of the most dissatisfying endings with no real silver-lining that I've ever read.  I felt like it was done to just be &#34;shocking.&#34;. It's a slap in the face to readers, if you ask me.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I started watching Spartacus when it premiered on Starz a few years ago. I have never purchased any television series on DVD before, but Spartacus is an exception. The action and drama in the Spartacus seasons is phenomenal. I would recommend this series to anyone (who isn't faint of heart).
B001BANK32|4.0|A fun book. I had forgotten so much of this story. I think I've seen the movie too many times. The book and the movie are so opposite to each other. BOOK: Wendy is blonde. MOVIE: Wendy is brunette. BOOK: Jack writing a play. MOVIE: Jack writing a novel.  BOOK: Jack burns to death. MOVIE: Jack freezes to death. There are so many interesting things to compare between the two mediums, it's no wonder they've  been so widely studied.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Watching GodFather 1 and 2.<br />on blue-ray<br /><br />is an awesome experience to relive the entire series once more.<br /><br />I think I've learned lots about doing business, from The Godfather !
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I ordered Gladwell's &#34;David and Goliath prior to it's release or reading a single review of the book.  How can one go wrong with Gladwell's unique ability to look at our world from such unique perspectives?  It did not disappoint.  We often give credit to overcoming adversity to building of strong character and forging the resilience that makes us successful.  Gladwell quantifies and explains why this is often true.  Not only should we not be surprised by David's success, it should be expected due to his unique approach to battle.  The development of adaptations to dyslexia helps explain the successes of many entrepreneurs who have had to find new skills to deal with their handicap.  Increasing income can assist someone to be a better parent, but only up to a point in which wealth becomes an impediment to good parenting.  In education, smaller class size is thought to be a key to improved learning, but Gladwell demonstrates using the concept of the reverse U-shaped curve, that at some point smaller is not better.  Like any of Gladwell's books the reader comes away with the stimulation of neurons that otherwise might remain dormant and locked in preconceived paradigms.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game has great graphics and fun times. For this type of game you could not ask for a better way to do it.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I took one star away because it is a little formulaic. That said it's a fun and entertaining show. Let's face it ladies, it's worth watching just for Jax Teller ;)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|You'll love it if you're into hunting and maybe if you're not. Not an IAP brick wall at all, but would easily be worth spending a few bucks. Get it!
B008JFUO72|4.0|I just watched this on DVD. I am slightly disappointed. I didn't know a lot about the movie before watching it and so a couple of things took me buy surprise. First of all this is more of a Tony Stark Film than an Iron Man film. Sure, there are plenty of Iron Man suits in the move its just rare that Tony Stark is in them! However, I do like the anxiety and trauma issues that he is dealing with. That is good character development. I do like how Marvel has heroes that are not perfect and who have flaws. Makes them more human and I can relate to them better.<br /><br />I was not happy with how they turned the Mandarin into a front and a fake for Killian. Sir Ben Kingsley  is a great actor and he was doing a good job as the Mandarin and even though it was a good plot twist, and that scene where the truth is told is great, I would have liked to have seen Kingsley play out the bad guy role. The movie does have a ton of really good action scenes and I did enjoy the story itself. Guy Pierce does an excellent job as the villain, Killian.<br /><br />As usual Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Tony Stark. It is his movie and he provides great quips and attitude and also a real depth of humanity as he deals with his trauma along with the terrifying events that are unfolding. I enjoy the continuity of the Marvel Universe and how the movie tied his PSTD to the events from the Avenger's movie.<br /><br />Despite my slight disappointment with a couple of issues the movie is an exciting action adventure roller coaster ride!
006202406X|1.0|If I wanted to experience soul-crushing depression, I would just stay in the real world and read the news from around the world every day. The ending was unimaginably cruel and painful to read. I read for hope. I have had enough of tragedy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Oh the tales we weave. What an incredible story and the circumstances unfortunately could be any one of us. We never know what twists and turns our lives can take in moments of passion or anger or love. Circumstances change, decisions we make can affect not only our own lives but lives that are around us. This was a compelling and emotional story, I loved the book.
B009NXD6JM|5.0|A sweet love story about two people fall in love. Over coming their opposite life styles!! Then there's always Cat. Audrey sings Moon River. George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn in their prime!!
B00422LESO|4.0|Cute, easy read. I liked that it was about  the romance and was clean. Good writing and good characters. Fun
0553381687|5.0|Great fantasy book. Really good to find a new series (well, new to me) with dungeons, dragons, swords and magic. I'm getting sick of the over-saturation of the market of witches, vampires and werewolves. I've been looking for something different for a while, and George R. R. Martin is it. CAN NOT WAIT to read the next book in the series.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I give the game 4 stars for how fun it is to play and how well it works on the Kindle Fire HD. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is, I have to wait for a long time for the power levels to build up.  But once power is back up, I am off and hunting.  The game has great graphics and there is not alot of waiting for the game to load up the choosen hunts.  I have downloaded other games that were free that would lock up my Kindle and this one doesn't.  If you are interested in hunting or like a game that will challenge you.......this is the game.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|I loved seeing this movie in the theaters and laughed very hard. The whole cast was amazing. Definitely buying this!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have this game  on all my other devices. Fun, addicting, all that good stuff. So first I wait almost a year for it to come out on Kindle, and now, it won't download! It has said downloading for the past 3 days, no joke! It may be an issue with Amazon bit that doesn't mean the King.com cant do anything about it. They should really fix this. Without this issue I would give it 10000000 stars (if it would let me!)
0749942908|4.0|Really enjoyed this light romance. Lots of fun. A little surprising that someone supposedly so shy she can't speak for stammering is able to talk to this intimidating, domineering man with hardly a trace of her characteristic stammer. Looking forward to the final book in the series.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|This is a great read, found it very hard to put it down.  I had to relegate it to daytime reading, otherwise I was awake all night reading it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a very entertaining period drama with bits of humor here and there.  The characters have so much depth that you become very interested in there every move.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It was very tricky. It was so hard that if it weren't for the cheats on the computer, I would have deleted this game. I think that in the new levels that they should add sound affects. It would totally make me love it more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive. I play everyday as often as I can..on 2 devices. Cannot stop playing.  Bring more candies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is a useful tool for my study. If Amazon does not limit the number of bag, I think I will buy more than 3.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Loved the first fruit drops and was happy to see #2 come out and I love they stayed in the same format as the first, just more twists. Great job and I am anxious for #3
006202406X|1.0|I was so excited for this book to come out and the anticipation was better than the book. Seems like Roth bit off more than she could chew with a convoluted, disjointed plot with a tone that did not seem to fit the previous two books ( and not because it is told from Tris AND Four's perspective.) all the questions I had since the beginning have, quite frankly, lame silly explanations. If you read the previous two, yes read this just to finish the trilogy (and to complain about that ending!) however if you haven't started the series just know that it starts off great but unfortunately can't close the deal.
0786838655|5.0|Rick Riordan knows how to write a book—this is a brilliant start to an amazing series! I love the characters, the story, the mythological aspects of it, and just about everything. I haven’t had so much fun with a children’s series since Harry Potter. Thank you, Riordan, for giving me something to live for after the end of Harry Potter series.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this series if you’re even remotely interested in it.
0307271609|3.0|This is an odd book to review. The story is compelling: a detailed portrait of a fascinating and little known woman. As human biography, it's compelling; as history, less so: it's a very one-sided account. And as a piece of writing... well, I read a prepublication review copy, which means that it was incomplete in various ways. I hope the final editorial pass cleaned up some of the awkward language, because the draft I read certainly needed it.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|It's flashy and interesting.  However, it was a bit on the unsatisfying side.  I will watch it again and give it another chance.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Should be in the middle to early high school science curriculum.<br />Strikes a balance between deep serious science and simple and easily reachable language.
030788743X|4.0|The biggest hurdle I had with this book is the ridiculously flooded ’80s references in this book. It’s so pathetic—and sad—how the world is stuck in this virtual world overloaded with ’80s themes.<br /><br />I have nothing against gaming but living your life in a virtual world your entire days and months, is pathetic. Not sad, just plain pitiful. Especially considering everyone is choosing to ignore the real world where people are actually suffering. Reading about 25% through this book, I got sick and tired of the 80s crap. (No offense against 80s pop culture) but it was just wayyy too much. It got better till the end but seriously, I was so sick of the same repeated stuff.<br /><br />Because I did not like the prolonged pop culture stuff, I had a lot of trouble liking the main character. I actually wish this book was written from Art3mis’s point-of-view because…let’s just face it, she’s much better at this. BTW, the Arthurian legend reference was pretty cool, naming the main character Parzival. I like Art3mis’s attitude, her thoughts, and just about everything so I wish it was written from her POV honestly.<br /><br />As for the story, I give full credit for a beautifully crafted story. It’s slow at the beginning but it picks up soon and is very well paced and easy to follow. I could pick up where I left off after a while and still be able to follow. Just out of curiosity, I imagined the book being turned into a movie and—I don’t think it could work. But the action is amazing in the book, I see why most people liked it. Excellent for a debut novel and overall, a good read. Would definitely recommend it!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This read is a great deal of fun.  Everything in the story seems almost plausible, and our hero escapes doom over and over.
B00BY7NK96|4.0|This was a good read at a time I needed a little boost. I like Sheyl's direct approach and the things she said makes a lot of sense. Have tried to apply some of her principles since in my job applications.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been playing this game for some time. It is a good game for all ages. Love it very much.
0141198966|5.0|First off, I have to be honest in saying that I was actually very surprised that the story—the original text—is nothing like the stories we have today about Frankenstein. First being that Frankenstein wasn’t even the name of the that freaky dude. He was actually called the creature or the monster in the book and came to be the Frankenstein monster but he wasn’t actually called that so…tough call for any families actually named Frankenstein during those days.<br /><br />Second, this book is terrifying! It’s more than the image of this monster that’s scary because in reality, there’s not even much of description of the creature except he was yellow skin, had big eyes, like 8 ft tall, and had black lips. No really, there’s barely a paragraph of him. So I don’t know where the green colored Herman Munster comes from really. But back to what I was saying…ah yes, the terror! Because there’s so much background of this doctor Victor Frankenstein it’s scary to imagine what goes inside his psychotic little head. The description of what he does and what he thinks is so detailed, the story seems to be like a big fat foreshadow. And there’s so much death! Caroline, William, Henry, etc… Any character besides Vic barely lasts a few chapters.<br /><br />If you haven’t read it, I would definitely suggest it. Usually classics are either a strong no or yes but this is a strong yes for me! It’s completely worth it and if you ever consider watching the ridiculous movie adaptations then read the book first! The movies are ridiculous, specially the one with Robert De Niro in it.<br /><br />Overall Rating: Well, who am I to rate it? Except that I really did like it, for a horror book. It’s definitely up there with Stephen King, actually way better than SK, so I would definitely give it a 5/5.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is very very fun and I like it a lot. I play it everyday. The visual are great
006202406X|2.0|Veronica Roth is a great writer. A lot of people recommended the Divergent to me months ago. I gave it a try. It was a great journey on the first two books. Exciting, as they say but the third book, the ending in particular is just disappointing. I mean, I wasn't hoping for a happily ever after but for them to survive what they are fighting for. Other people were given a chance to live their life without being judge based on their genes but not her. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. I'm contemplating if I'll get a refund. I wouldn't recommend it now to my friends.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is a perfect book for history lovers looking for interesting details behind banner headlines just before the Great Depression. Bryson's unique talent for gentle storytelling makes this an easy exploration of an incredibly fascinating short period in American history. I took a friend to the dentist for a prolonged procedure. They took her in and I settled into a waiting room chair reading the book.  When she came out several hours later, I was surprised how quickly it seemed -Great read!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My six month old loves this toy. She can bounce around and play with some of the toys already and will be able to grow into the rest of the things she cant reach yet.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Grew up listening to Pearl Jam in Sunny California during the great new *Grunge* era in the 90's and have been a diehard fan ever since! Every album and plenty of concert' s later..Pearl Jam always JAMZ! Lovin this CD and the Auto-Rip feature was great to get to jam out to on my phone:)
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is easy to understand great graphics and its challenging to level up<br />The enemies vary I just started and its challenging already well worth the download time;') .
B0044DEAUA|5.0|After looking around, I was almost set on this Bluetooth, but at the last minute I read another review here about the BlueAnt Sense being better.  The reviews for the BlueAnt were great too, so I decided to buy the BlueAnt because supposedly this is a well-known name?  I didn't like the BlueAnt. I ended up sending it back to Amazon and trying the Supertooth, which I like much better. The BlueAnt was bulky - when it was on your visor it was thick.  It's not as long as the Supertooth, but was thicker, so it bothered me when driving (as it's right in front of your face). The SuperTooth Buddy is thinner...it's longer, but thinner, and I don't notice that it's there. The BlueAnt Sense didn't have physical buttons which bothered me, and I kept having to fiddle around with trying to get the device to detect that I wanted to turn up the volume, etc.  Also annoying - it reset every time, and I'd have to go through the prompts all over again to select English and calibrate my phone.  This is not the case for the Supertooth - there are real buttons that make commands easier. The buttons are clear, and easy for someone to figure out while driving.  You don't have to go through any initial setup, or recurring setup when turning the device on, other than connecting to the Bluetooth on your phone, which is simple. The signal is strong - as others have said, you should try to remember to turn it off before leaving the car so that you don't stay connected when you go inside the house. It's easy to reconnect to.  The volume is excellent.  I was driving in slushy rain/some hail the other day and my husband said that he could hear the rain/hail, but it wasn't too bad...he could still hear me clearly. Both parties can hear well - I LOVE that you can easily switch the Bluetooth to both sides of the sun visor - this is GREAT for driving with sun glare...I have an hour and a half drive each way to work, facing the sun - so this comes in handy! I talk to my husband on these long drives - mostly all highway, and he says the sound is excellent.  He can detect the difference in sound when I go over a bridge or hit the warning strips on the side of the highway, but it's not bad, and you'd hear that with just your phone too. The only negative is that it doesn't come with a car charger?? The battery lasts a LONG time - but it should come with a car charger.  I'll look into purchasing this separately - you'd just need to buy a USB to Cigarette lighter charger. Maybe some cars have a USB charging station?  I'll be buying another one soon as a gift - this is a great product so far (owned for two weeks, but have used it for 15+ hours).
B0089LOG02|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The author is skilled at helping you fall in love with the characters in this story.  I was shocked and saddened when I checked to see what I had left to read and it was less then 40 pages.  My heart welled up with joy at times and I also had tears running down my face at others.  I would highly recommend this book to my friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Fantastic acting and storyline, intricate twists and turns and overall delightful and fascinating program, though I must confess the ending is very disatisfying personally because one of the and if not the best character was killed off the show.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I am definitely not enjoying this game. The time out stinks with a wait of 25 minutes. I'll pick away at it until another game catches my eye. I don,t understand the hype I've heard about this game.There are so many games on my Kindle that doesn't penalize you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it!!! My best purchase ever.<br />I really recommend this gadget: it's cheap and works just as expected. I use it with Netflix.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Keeping with the tradition of his previous books of pointing abstract perspectives, Gladwell points out how many of life's situations and circumstances that are viewed as a disadvantage can be advantageous. He presents many examples of how situations that are perceived as a disadvantage can be turned to an advantage. As always, Gladwell presents this material in a very entertaining format. Without a doubt Malcolm Gladwell is one of America's most entertaining writers.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have to commend Roth for one thing; despite her books being made into a film she didn't let that game and success cloud her decision. Those decisions ultimately ruined not only the book but the series for me. George RR Martin has made it trendy to shock your audience by routinely killing characters. In that instance it can happen but he also has three hundreds more characters to move to the forefront and fill that loss. When you build a universe, series, fandom, around one character your readers are owed a few things. Tolkien is the best example of this. He didn't give Frodo a happily ever after, he is crippled by carrying the ring and knows a weight of darkness that can never leave him but Frodo lives and that is necessary for the readers to love the book.  More recently this is scene in Suzanne Collins final Hunger Games book. Katniss loses her best friend, her beauty, her little sister and even her mind but not her life. There is redemption in seeing these characters, as flawed as they are, come back to their lives. Roth breaks this promise to her readers and robs them of the hope that got them through three books that, despite it all, Tris would survive. I admire Roth for having the courage to decimate her entire Divergent universe even if I disagree. At the end of the book we're only left with characters whom we either have very little personally invested, Cara, Shauna and Amar, or who we've seen do terrible things, Tobias, Caleb and Peter.  Roth completely ruined not only my hopes for Allegiant but also my investment in the series. It almost feels as if she had all of her strongest characters killed so that no one else can write or even guess at their futures.  Tris' mother, Will, Marlene, Lynn, Uriah and then ultimately Tris herself, it's as if Roth killed off all of her characters who are able to experience joy.<br />And finally, the goodbye shared between Tobias and Tris to me showed Roth as a weak writer. You could argue that she wanted to make the lossraw--demonstrate how unplanned and unexpected Tris' death was. But writers give their heroines and heroes great goodbyes. This is the moment in writing you should be heavy handed and maudlin and Roth didn't step up to the task.<br />If you haven't started the series don't bother. If you've started save yourself the trouble of ruining what is one excellent book (Divergent) and a great one (insurgent) for yourself.
0525953590|4.0|I didn't finish reading yet, but I like very much the clarity of the text. Probably I will come back with a complete review (very possible with 5 stars)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting.  One of my favorites.  I love the levels so you aren't doing the same thing over and over.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|I guess, overall, it's not a bad movie. I just do not feel that it compares to the original, but then I feel this way about the majority of remakes.<br /><br />All I can really say is that it seemed like something was missing. I remember the original, way back in the day, and the queasy/uneasy feeling that I had to the whole movie. This one never got to that point.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game, it is so fun and really goes with the movies. I like how there are weekly challenges because it keeps it interesting but that can also make it addicting!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|While I was shocked with the abrupt ending, I did kind of like that it was open to imagination. This was a great series that I could not put down!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Mimics the calculator your grandmother used to use. Nice large keys<br />Make it easy to use. Runs fast very practical. I keep it in my favorites list. This app includes only a calculator for simple arithmetic.<br /><br />Have not experienced any freeze ups, works flawlessly. I recommend it for anyone who keeps a calculator laying around.
0439598427|5.0|\\"Is your mama a llama?\\" Is a great book, cute story. The way it rhymes is winner with children. My daughter absolutely loves this book. It has been her favorite for a very long time. I bought schleich animals matching the animals in the story and my daughter loves holding each animal as we ask if its mama is a llama.<br />Absolutely recommend
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Kid movie for all ages. If you like to laugh at your family watch this. They succeeded in the funniest ways.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was great to catch up on Danny Torrance's life, I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.  I loved the character of Abra, however I wasn't wild about the True Knot people.  I didn't find them particularly frightening and this is why I give Doctor Sleep four stars instead of five.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|As long as you're not looking for fine cinema and realize that you are watching a live anime then you should enjoy it.  Get your giant mech fix and enjoy.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|How I Met Yout Mother is my favorite show of all time! Witty, clever and always entertaining. Can't wait to see Ted find love, but will cry like I know them :)
B000GPIPSS|4.0|It's a great movie, enjoying seeing this 1931 classic very much! The packaging however, was a large disappointment. While the outside of the case looks nice, when I opened it I found that the cheap glue that was used to keep the plastic DVD holders had completely come off the case. I guess I can glue them back in place, but not impressed by that.
0393343405|5.0|A terrific read, a great research demonstration.  History written in an exciting, narrative flow.  No wonder it won the Pulitzer.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This season so far has been more about who the people become after the initial shock of the walkers has set in. The new threat of illness heightens the anxiety of wondering how they will possibly make it out alive!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Enjoyable, fast read. Lots of facts mixed in with lots of action. Plausible and fun. Still, I don't ever want to pick up a hitchhiker.
B0000C7PRY|4.0|Good. Very, very good.  Fantastic music and great flow.  Crisp production.  Prog with heart and a message.  Neal rocks it.
006202406X|1.0|Don't waste your money or your time!  Tris dies.  The author took the easy way out- shock value.  Her inexperience and youth are showing in this last book- as well as her utter disregard and disrespect for her audience.  I will not be supporting her movies or her books anymore.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome!!!!!!!! fun to play i like the jet pack best when upgraded at 30000 you get lots of coins i wish that the health inspector was smarter
B000OCXIDK|3.0|This was an enjoyable read.  Fascinating descriptions of the lives of young women with little means an  little choice other than being maids or the like.  Fun to think of what may have gone through Vermeer's mind while creating.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My 9 year old daughter can't get enough of this movie!  The acting is great (Sophia Robb did an amazing job), the story is inspiring, and the lesson is wonderful! Our whole family loves watching this movie, and I am excited that my daughter also wanted the book to read!
B002UJIY7A|5.0|We LOVED this movie!  It is a FUN, WILD ride!  Newlyweds Cydney (Milla Jovovich) and Cliff (Steve Zahn) are on their honeymoon in Hawaii taking a beautiful hike on a remote trail when they meet Nick (Timothy Olyphant), a self-described &#34;superhero&#34; and his independent girlfriend Gina (played by Kiele Sanchez).  Someone has been killing young couples on the island with no known suspects.  The couples hit it off and decide to keep each other company on the trail but soon tensions run high.<br />These characters are so well written that you begin to think you can get into their heads.  The cinematography, of course, is outrageously gorgeous, the director has  an edge-of-your-seat pace and a &#34;guessing 'til the very end&#34; about who is the murderer, and a killer script.  Everything comes together in this movie to make it a very watchable 5-Star film!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. &amp; it's addicting. Just wish I could get passed level 23... &amp; that it didn't take forever for your lives
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|All of the songs on this album are terrific, and this it the type of album that seems to get better each time you listen to it.
B00BG5CXGM|3.0|Defective case does not align properly with the buttons, making them hard to use. The sleep/awake button is particularly troublesome.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Pretty good past time. I enjoy not having to be on it constantly just to make sure everything goes right.
0091929784|5.0|I choose this rating because I received the product in excelent conditions. It was received on time, it satisfied my expetactions. I recomend this product definetively
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really like this book. It kept me interested all the way to the end. Only bad thing is that it is over.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like how I get to customize my robot and fight that makes this game good<br />I enjoy knocking the other robots out
B00827OWO8|3.0|I had problems with this reproduction.  There was no audio in both the 'rated' and 'unrated' version of the movie.  However, I had to choose the 'Chapters' option to view the film which contained the audio.  Need to look at your reproduced steps.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so hooked I spent an entire weekend on all 3 seasons...waiting for season 4 Amazon don't make me wait too long please i'm dying here
B000OSDSKM|5.0|very interesting/fast moving movie, have to keep watching until end......i view often. never tire of it....very<br />good cast and story line.......
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved reading this book.  Only picked it up because of book club but glad I read it even if fiction
B00009XNS9|5.0|Ordered this for a Christmas gift.  Very impressed at the size and quality of the truck compared to what is available in the stores.
006202406X|2.0|(may contain spoilers) I loved Divergent and after Insurgent, I assumed the Tris would make a comeback and grow more, allowing readers to understand her character more. Didn't happen. I was open to the change in POV, but was disappointed when it got too confusing. The ending would have worked if all the loose ends and unanswered questions were addressed, but they weren't. It feels like everything was just thrown off a cliff. If Roth had elaborated more on a couple of issues (like why Tris was immune to death serum, or how her mom was just thrown into Dauntless, or what Matthew's did to convince Caleb to work for her) then it would have been fine. The ending didn't suck, but it didn't amaze me either. I had so much hope in Roth to develop the character's more, for example the relationship between Cristina and Tris, or Tris and Four, but it didn't happen. To make it worse random things were introduced and then just thrown out like Peter's change of heart or Tori and Georgie. It was overall frustrating as a dedicated reader to just have this thrown at me. It could've been wonderful and surprising, but really in the end everyone (characters and readers) will just be left neither happy nor unhappy.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I wish it was a little louder.  Almost slept through it the other day. Other than that I like it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A breath of fresh air in an age of stale imitation and mimicry. Keeps you guessing until the end. Characters that you'll fall in love with and a story line that makes you wish that the night circus were real. The Ringling Brothers pale in comparison to the tangible Le Cirque Des Reves. I will definitely be looking for more from this author.
B00FF8OKJE|3.0|Empire was a good game indeed, however since the update the app has stopped working. The game includes time consuming aspect. Content in-game requires time to finish a set task, or rubies which is the currency of the makers. Rubies do cost real money to obtain and can instantly make any processing task instant finish, however rubies take count in the hundreds and it will cost a specific amount of rubies to finish a set Time.  The game has resources, armies, and other players to make this a official multi player game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted simply addicted.  I didn't get what all the hype was about. Once I decided to take a look can't stop. I get so angry sometimes.
044024613X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, & have already shared it with my Daughter-in-law.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to others.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This was cooler than iron man 3 the game fight all day on this one<br />every day I play this game
1451695195|1.0|There was too much new age and occult books that he recommended for people to read so I don't like what was recommended
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was a joy to read.  Page turner, happiness, sadness, mystery.  Loved it.  A little concerned at first because each chapter was a different time period but it was easy to catch on after a few chapters.  Definitely recommend for anyone looking to get away from their day and discover the forgotten garden.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|She is very excited to play and to show me her skill levels.  it is a game that makes you laugh as you watch the expressions on the Minion's face.  Cute game.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|It's slow reading due to the number of characters and location name. But definitely interesting. I can't wait to finish this one and start the next book in the series.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'm at a loss of words. This reads like FanFic. Did she not really have an end to the story when she started and this is just what she came up with on the fly? It's just so bad, I don't know where to start. Terrible character development some even seemed to be going backwards. The horrid split first person narrative with such bland inner dialogue that I couldn't remember who I was supposed to be. The plot 'twists' so bad the entire story would have moved forward without them and yet she tried to make it a focal part of the story. What about the part where all the characters are so trusting of strangers they just met? Why? They have no reason to trust anyone, barely even each other. They've been lied to by everyone about everything their entire lives. But this complete stranger seems trustworthy. I can't go on, it's just so terribly bad.<br /><br />I want a do over!
B00493SIIA|5.0|Common sense advice here. Live under your means, save and invest your money regularly, don't fall into buying status objects, buy used cars instead of new, don't abuse credit cards, etc... Easy reading and very informative.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed playing.  Not difficult but not too easy either.  Intriguing story line made it hard to put down. I would like k e to see more games from this maker.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|excellent and timely, this is perhaps the single most important  book I have read. After years of puzzling 'quantum' theory, I GET IT!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|streams well, sometimes drops network connection and there is voice lag when when streaming. please update for bug fix soon. thanks.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is very addicting. Easy to use. I really wish it was a faster progression available and more oppurtunities to investment points.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This is truly a great fantasy read. Seriously, it is amazing!<br /><br />In this book, you'll meet the members of The Gentleman Bastards. They are a tight knit 'family' of thieves bent on taking all the gold they can from the wealthy royals. Locke is the brains, Jean is the muscle, Galdo and Calo are the twin actors, and Bug is the apprentice.<br /><br />This story has so many dimensions that it really draws you in and won't let you go. I'm excitedly moving on to the second (and then the third) installment of the Gentlemen Bastard Sequence.<br /><br />Really, read this book.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|Great show with great visiual effects,. keeps you on toes with Action packed story line.  The idea of Sci creatures is a must see for those who might have enjoyed the old Godzilla shows. Worth the time and money.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|A wonderful tale of how society destroys love by confusing it with sex. Two people find happiness by focusing on the mental and emotional relationship first... the sex became a natural byproduct of that bond that was already strong. Still Hollywood, but good message
006202406X|3.0|So yes, the ending was upsetting. It wasn't the happy ending we all wanted. But, it makes archetypal sense. Tris was a matyr. She willingly put herself in the situation wherein she would save the world, but lose her life. Yes, Tris could have lived, and she and Four live happily ever after with their kids jumping off of trains or whatever, but it would have felt fake. It's the same problem I have with the end of Mockingjay. While I'm glad that they live happily ever after, it always felt off, like it didn't quite fit with the rest of the series. From the beginning of this series, we knew that no character was safe from being killed off. Tris, being Abegnation, in my opinion pretty much to her core, she was inherently selfless. She was bravest when she was putting herself in between those who would undoubtedly kill her if they got the chance, and those she loves. She was a protector. To the end. The choice made complete sense in character and in the world that the author created.<br /><br />There is one plot twist that I take issue with. The whole GD/GP thing really frustrated me. It felt like a copout of an explanation for the world that she created. I myself am I scientist, a biologist specifically so I understand the biology behind genetic modification etc, and it really doesn't make any real kind of scientific sense. But then again, just write it off as, the \\"broken\\" genes were just an excuse for the horrible death and destruction dealt out during the Purity War. But it is really hard for me to believe that scientists would hold so tightly to something that makes little scientific sense. We know that some genes will predispose you to certain behaviors, but your genes do not dictate a person's personality or their decision making process or their sense of morals or right and wrong. The environment a person is raised in, the society he lives, the culture he/she is exposed to play an enormous part in making a person who they are.<br /><br />So that's my rant and rave about this series and specifically this book. All in all, I did like the series and this book. It felt strange that Four would participate in the first rising and inadvertently kill Uriah, but it made sense because he kinda had his foundation ripped out from under him when they told him he wasn't actually Divergent, which was kind of explained by he had a strange genetic mutation, and then was never touched again. Would have liked more explanation about that. But anyway. Really liked it.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am a fan of the new series they've started.  These movies are EXCELLENT !  I didn't know if I'd like them but Chris Pine is awesome.  He does a great job in these movies and the humor and action is perfect.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe Dr. Alexander was in an altered state of presence.  I believe he had a spiritual journey.  I actually could imagine his journey was real.<br /> My only problem was the explanation for all the suffering in the world. Better yet the need for evil in order for good to prevail. Maybe Dante's Inferno is real. So are we living in different stages of hell while we're conscious and in live in the flesh?<br />Good and fast read, but as usual,  I had more questions than answers.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you have not yet discovered the Divergent series...dive in!  After months of waiting for the release of the final book in this trilogy, Veronica Roth provides the finale to what happens when government tries to take control of human nature. Guess what?  Nature wins!  Loved every minute of this book.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Interesting game, challenging for all ages, puzzles increase in difficulty as you progress. The game functions well, saves progress, has options for multiple family members to have their own profile. Great for logic and spatial work.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I haven't finished the game yet, but so far this is an great game. perfect graphics,and amazing gameplay. I LOVE THIS GAME.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Just sayin if you dont want to cry skip this book<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />Yea i know it was a really good book until c...chapter 50.  Veronica Roth did such a good job with the first two.  Then she had to stab me in the back with she wrote t...t...the tragic death of Beatrice Prior. Yes, I cried in Hunger Games and Mockingjay , Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,  The Death Trials, and The Last Olympian. But I've never cried that much in a book before.  The book is predictable and that after all that had happened between Tobias and Evelyn that they just forgave each other like that.  All my emotions are mixed up and i just want to punch something.  Veronica Roth you had so much potential to write a spectacular ending for this series and you ruined the whole series with this one. I can't even look at any of the books without crying.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />I liked how that the point of view changes every chapter except that t gets confusing sometimes. How it was a spectacular read with challenging vocab that challenged much of my brain. It was well plotted and I never got bored around it. I was hooked on it almost right away.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />It wasnt bad but like i said i was in love with intill you know what
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This was a free book and was well worth the read. It had a rather slow beginning but before long I was wrapped up in the characters and \\"searching\\" for answers. It was enjoyable jumping from Atlanta to France an  learning a turnabout both.<br /><br />A quick and fun read. Would recommend .
B00004XPPC|5.0|A classic movie...superb cast...a quality DVD.  I have seen this movie many time.  It's nice to have a copy of my own.  I never tire of watching it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|it is complex without being too stressful, you can retake the level quickly to correct mistakes. good graphics and sound
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this for what it one day will be, the ultimate supplemental media streaming device. That being said it still has some work ahead of it, the cast desktop and tab options have significant lag and in the whole desktop option the screen is flipped upside down. Understandably both of the aforementioned options are labeled &#34;Beta&#34; so expect improvements in the future. The Youtube application is problem free and extremely impressive, as is the Netflix application. I look forward to the day when the supported application list expands to Amazon Video.
0470932139|5.0|I can't seem to go anywhere without bringing it along with me because I love it so much!  Exceptionally thorough and detailed without being tedious or complicated.  Contains an outstanding resource section at the end.  Buy two copies and give one to a food-photo-loving friend.
B007REV4T8|5.0|love all the james bond movies. i can watch them over and over! they are intense, witty and well thought out! i can't seem to get my fill of james bond movies!
B0085YNML2|5.0|I think this game is super cute and fun. The little lizard is so cute and the graphics are really good. It is a stable game that never lags and the touch controls are spot on. It starts out really easy but it gets more difficult as you advance to higher levels. It's a game that I like to play to pass time for a few minutes and the kids like it too.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|love this movie! like all the previous movies! and to say the least, this one is right up there with adventure and intensity. action every where!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Appropriate for all ages even adults! Very fun game and its even more fun if you have watched Despicable Me 2. Great game I love it.
B00AQSN7HE|5.0|love ALL the James Bond movies! I wasn't sure I was going to like Daniel Craig as James Bond but I love, love love Daniel Craig as the new Bond!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|One of those books &#34;you couldn't put down.&#34; A bit heavy on the sexual side for me, but the cleanest porn I have ever seen.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Can You Escape is a good app. to have if you want to think and pass the time. Wish there were more levels though!
B00AW57L96|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars but this book deserved it. Lots of Australian references which I loved. Three women and their family relationships. I liked the way the author entwined the three womens' stories. The book is very well written. The author has touched on the small signs in relationships that are often brushed over but can make a world of difference in the end. She has filled the pages with humour and pain. Intense and heart-breaking in parts. I am looking forward to reading another one of her books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game there is so much you can do I rate this app all 5 stars I love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very enjoyable game great challenges. Good way to kill some time while keeping your problem solving skills sharp. Hope they keep adding to it.
006202406X|5.0|SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE THIS WAS NEVER A ROMANCE NOVEL, AN ALTHOUGH I CRIED LIKE I WAS READING TFIOS I UNDERSTOOD. STOP PUTTING HER REVIEWS DOWN , SHE IS AN AMAZING AUTHOR NO MATTER HER CREATIVE CHOICES...
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I always knew that Katy Perry was inspirational. After watching this movie I see her in a brighter light. Katy is a genuine artist who loves what she does and her fan are what keeps her going! She had this dream while growing up to be just her and show people its ok to be you and she did that, but she had to work at it and she worked hard. Katy really did love Russell Brand. I cried like a baby who is teething because I could see the pain and the devastation behind those blue eyes, it was written in her body language, but in the end she pulled it together because her fans will always be there for her. I highly recommend this movie for all ages who understand the little necessities of life. Great family movie. I am an even BiGgEr KaTy CaT fan now.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I love angry birds star wars but when the second one came out I was excited but it need  an update so for now stick with the free one hope update come  soon :/
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|If you read Outliers, you already know the drill with Malcolm Gladwell. He challenges our assumptions. He does more of the same in David and Goliath. Instead of the &#34;it's going to take you 10,000 hours of practice to get good&#34; theme, he here points out that, in many cases, the underdog really has the advantage [or may not be an underdog at all, as David was not at all when he faced the giant].<br /><br />The stories, and analysis of them, are good. If I have a criticism, it is this: by the time to get to the end, you're a bit weary of a bit of repetition. This does not diminish the book. It's just that you might find yourself thinking, &#34;okay, okay, I get it.&#34;<br /><br />Having said that, I still highly recommend the book. It is good and inspiring for us to have our assumptions challenged. Give it a read.
1442337966|5.0|This is the best thing I have ever heard. I listen to it everyday, I feel so much better and happy. I would recommend this to everyone if you want an amazing life.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Sweet. From when real people made real music instead of the compressed crap that passes for music these days. We need to go back to vinyl.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|World War Z was a middle of the road action/mystery/adventure.  It played fair with the story, and if you paid the slightest attention, you could see the ending coming a mile away.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game! I am thrill we finally have it on Kindle. I play on my phone and this is so much better.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A story about one mans life long journey in North Korea and his will to survive against the odds. Fascinating and disturbing at the same time. I highly recommend it.
1476727651|4.0|Great follow-up to The Shining. Danny Torrance has matured... and so has Stephen King. King's storytelling in this book is just as eerie and suspenseful as it has always been—I can't count how many times he made the hair on the back of my neck stand up—but our lead character is now more thoughtful and reflective. The story is therefor richer, and feels much more personal. King has always had a talent for making the reader feel they're sitting down with him, listening to a story from his own lips during a dark and stormy evening at home; but in Doctor Sleep King takes this one step further. It doesn't just feel like he's telling A story, it feels almost as if he's telling you HIS OWN story. The ending felt as if perhaps it came along a bit abruptly, but that could very well just be my dismay at the book having to end at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. It's very time consuming.exciting.a good way to kill time while waiting for an appointments. Thank u thank u!
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I love this classic.  Arrived in rather quick time.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Very interesting premise; good reading; able to finish quickly without getting bored. Will review/ follow this author for similar works.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|OK, its not a classic like Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein, but it will be! It will be. This is just a really fun movie that picks you up and doesn't let go until the ride is over. I highly recommend this movie for the actors, directors, writing and general good time you'll have. Michael Keaton does one of my favorite roles for him, allowing his zany, slightly dark humor to really bring the character to life.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|As much as I loved this trilogy I was disappointed with the ending of this book, I guess because I had made up in my head how I personally wanted to end as foolish as that is. However I wasn't as shocked that tris died but of how nonchalant the whole situation played out. Out of all possibilities all scenarios I expected something more well idk what I expected maybe I'm just skulking because it's all over Don't get me wrong I will be picking up this trilogy again and maybe that's what need to come to grips with this ending.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|It never hit me before when watching this movie until recently that this is basically Carrie, but for kids. Its the story of an oppressed little girl who has &#34;powers&#34;. But she uses them for good, fun and humor while righting wrongs. Its a feel good movie that is cute. We did find that for younger kids, there are a few parts that can make them a bit uncomfortable. The &#34;adults&#34; save for one, are quite unappealing characters ... to the extreme and the cruelty they show compared to the compassion of Matilda is at the heart of the story.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it'd  be nice if you could get coins, acorn's and silver coins faster. otherwise it's a really fun game to play
0736092269|5.0|I purchased this book and the Women's Strengh Training Anatomy at the same time.  I did not purchase them for body building purposes, but for anatomical reference as an artist.  The illustrations are excellent for envisioning muscles in a variety of positions.  If anyone else is considering purchasing the books for this purpose, I'd recommend that you buy this one first and then consider if you  need Women's Strength Training Anatomy as many of the images for the female anatomy are contained in this book.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Colors are bright, fast paced, fun and entertaining... looks great on Kindle Fire. Has two game modes you can play.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I needed a weather app so I could  find out the weather where my daughter is going to college. I'm able to have our local weather as well as hers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game.  Really makes you think!  Try to complete levels without looking cheats up online.  You may not be able to do it without help!
B00FJU1HLC|2.0|This ,movie had no point and dragged to long, I don't understand what message it was conveying for kids.  Did not like.
006202406X|5.0|I may one of the few but I really enjoyed this book.  No, it wasn't my favorite in the trilogy but I still really enjoyed it, enough to fly through it and give it a 5 star rating.  I felt the way Roth wrapped up the story stayed true to the theme through out the book. Yes there was more suffering, yes there was more death, yes there was more violence but that's how the first two books were.<br /><br />I enjoyed the varying view points (alternating chapters) of Tris and Tobias in this book.  No the first two weren't that way but this is a different kind of book.  Tris had made herself known in the first two books.  This last book is about the final chapter of Chicago and all the characters in the book, not only Tris.<br /><br />Lots of people didn't like the ending, I think it fit the feel of the books and the characters.  I think Roth did a great job answering lots of questions and tying up loose ends.  I hate books that leave me with unanswered questions at the end.  This book didn't do that.  I am not an author so I don't think I can critique Roth on her ending.  It's her story and she wrote it the way she felt the story should go.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved it . There is so much action and suspense even a little drama.I think everyone will love this book
1416955070|2.0|This book was very thick and I felt every page.  You can find something much better written and exciting, so don't waste your time here.  I found it uninteresting and the characters so flat that I did not care what happened to them.  There was also no sense of urgency about finding Clary's mother.  I believe that was her ultimate goal in the book but her actions did not seem focused on that goal for most of the book.  The only exciting part was finding out who Jace's parents were.  I did not see that one coming. I cannot believe there are five or so more of these.  I have no interest in reading them.
B00E9ZFIMM|5.0|Easy to use &amp; if you long press on an entry, the option to delete pops up. Yes,  it could use some customization &amp; categorizing, but it's perfect for those quick notes on the go. I do like the auto save feature since I tend to forget to hit the Save button when I am in a hurry or if I am multitasking.
0385742886|4.0|Certainly do not read this before reading the Maze Runner trilogy as it will give all of the secrets away.  However, knowing the secrets after working through the three books, I still found this to be a page turner.  Yes, there are Cranks in the book but it does not seem as repetitive as in the Death Cure.  I liked how we learned about the sun flares through Mark's dreams.  I think the story flowed nicely and kept a great pace.  I did not want to put it down.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|My wife and I love this movie and have watched it many times.  It never gets old and is definitely a must watch!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Spolier Alert!!<br /><br />I just finished the book.  I am not sure what I was expecting. I feel that Insurgent did not have the magic of Divergent either.  I didn't mind the switching of perspectives but I feel like it only happened because the story was rather weak.  Also, we spent a lot of time on Tris' mom but still did not know anything about her father.  I feel like that could have been explored more.  And I feel like after all of the build up, the battle scenes happened rather quickly.<br /><br />Tris had to die.  She was so reckless with her life in the other two books that it had to happen.  Did people really expect her to live happily ever after with Four and tend a garden?  She was Dauntless and stayed true to that until the end.  I did enjoy the Epilogue.  I really liked the zip lining scene in the first book and thought that was a cool way to end the series.<br /><br />I did not waste my time reading this book.  However, I have been waiting for it for months now and was disappointed.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|I have to admit there I was apprehensive about “Winter Kills” while waiting for its release. Both “Pray for Villains” and “Beast” were full of good songs, but I feel over time and multiple listens I didn’t find them quite the same quality of albums as “The Fury of Our Maker’s Hand” or “The Last Kind Words.” When I heard “Ruthless,” I was underwhelmed. Add in Dez touring around with Coal Chamber again, and the fact that they had switched to a new record label, and yes, I am sad to say I read critic reviews (don’t do it people, it’s idiotic), and I got paranoid and anticipated that they might play it safe/phone it in with “Winter Kills.”<br /><br />Oh me of little faith.<br /><br />“Winter Kills” is the natural evolution from “Fury” and “Words” with the death metal elements of “Villains” and “Beast.” This album seems them combining their groove metal origins with epic death metal, and it is by far the heaviest thing they have ever released, I mean HEAVY, like an asteroid falling on your head heavy. I never would have thought DD would match the heaviness of Gojira and Meshuggah, but they did.<br /><br />Returning from “Words” is the epic guitar work, which has been stepped up. “Haunting Refrain” has easily my favorite guitar solo ever from the band, and I’m not even a guitarophile. Lyrically Dez has stepped it back up a notch, less repetitive choruses which plagued the last two albums.<br /><br />Some may whine with the band covering AWOLnation’s “Sail,” but not me. Sure it doesn’t sound like anything else on the album, and sounds more like a power metal-ish track, but it works well as a unique, catchy end to the album. Not to mention seeing DD perform it live in Silver Spring MD, the crowd ate it up, so I’d say it was a successful experiment.<br /><br />My real issue with the album is the track “Ruthless” I think it’s OK in comparison to the other ten tracks on the album, but I think its completely out of place as the second track. I think the repetitive mid paced groove of the song after the strong opener “Oath of the Abyss” halts the overall flow of the album. Maybe I would have placed “Ruthless” in the middle of the album, but more than likely would have replaced the track entirely with the b-side “Shudder” which is amazing and I have no idea why it was excluded from the standard album edition.<br /><br />Minor criticisms aside, I think “Winter Kills” is the best DevilDriver album since “The Last Kind Words,” and has instantly become my favorite metal album (tied with Chthonic’s “Bú-Tik”) of the year.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: “Winter Kills,” “Gutted” through “Caring’s Overkill,” “Sail.”
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy I don't have to go play on my PC!  Need more lives. Still learning the game but it is such fun!
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|After 4 years since their last album release and a change of record label, Placebo have brought out yet another stunning album. It's an album with a lot of tracks based on relationships which Brian originally wrote as solo projects but were then given that typical Placebo sound. Placebo's sound has always moved with the times but they've always managed to maintain their individual style and keep fans loyal. Love the album!
0062502182|5.0|keep an open mind and read this and it will change your life :) very inspiring &#34;follow your personal legend!&#34;
B001GM28HO|5.0|I have the 2 later albums and decided to see where hte craze all began.There are many good tunes on this disk.I never tire of her energetic and rhythmic approcah to music
B000001E18|5.0|I purchased Zooropa, because my first CD was destroyed.  Love this as I love all of U2's music.  Classic, different and quintessential U2!
B00266W04K|5.0|Live life to the fullest and be spontaneous.  Of course, some of the situations are pretty outrageous but after watching this movie you will want to be a Yes Man or Woman.
B00008X5J3|5.0|I purchased this for my wife when she asked for it. She loved it! That's all that matters to me at this time!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!! Very addicting and time consuming but I can't seem to put it down.<br />Have been playing it on my smart phone and now I have it on my Kindle!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be available on Kindle for a long time. The only complaint I have is that I do not have a facebook account so there are some levels where i you do not have friends to ask for help through facebook, you either have to pay to get to the next level or you have to do 3 quests. That would not be a big deal but you can only do 1 quest in a 24 hour period. So it is going to take me three days before I can move on. The game is extremely addictive so it is hard to wait the three days.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|I had heard this story used as an illustration, I wanted to read it myself.  It is quite a view of morality written by one who seemed to be haunted by that difficulty himself.  Sin always changes us even if it doesn't show.  A worthwhile read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great for the price. I downloaded for my kids and they enjoy this game very much. The graphics are not much but they enjoy creating and building things with this game. Keeps them busy. I recommend it.
B002ZG9800|3.0|Its a interesting CONCEPT that may have been a much better movie IF Jim Carrey did NOT rely on giving a comedic caricature.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Having so much fun worth time and strategic planning to get high scores. Soon as you think you got another goal to shoot for love  this game
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Magic Mike makes SHOWGIRLS appear like a OSCAR-worthy movie. At least SHOWGIRLS is a great campy-movie that is as over-the-top as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. Magic Mike is a movie that was all hype and no delivery.
B00EKQ3YZI|2.0|I love Donna's music and always enjoyed remixes and was looking forward to this release. Hate to say it but it's a major disappointment. I know remixes tend to be hit or miss but just about all of these are forgettable. Sad that something like this got a CD release but much of Summer's back catalog appears to be ignored except for the pricy Japan re-issues.
B00D3ZJDRA|3.0|Fell in love with Valerie June upon hearing her singing &#34;No Draws Blues&#34; on Sounds of Freedom Blues. Love her look that seems the polar opposite of the voice, genre of music & subject matter. Would have preferred more songs in the vein of this version of &#34;Workin' Woman Blues&#34; which is a great juxtaposing of her voice, american roots music, and african afro-beat.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I think it was well written, held my attention.  However I did not feel there was a real ending, too many questions remained.
B00009NHC5|4.0|Wait Until Dark is a great showcase of Audrey Hepburn thats displays her talents in a completely opposite way as her great Breakfast At Tiffany's ingenue.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Got these for a great price and eventhough they were used, they run perfectly!  Love star wars. Want to get the rest of them!
B00004WNS6|5.0|BLUE is an album that makes Joni Mitchell accessable. This is a great album for listening to at home on a Sunday afternoon or at a nice lounge or cafe
B000FCKBCU|3.0|This is a predictable fluff read - which is what I was looking for at the time.  It's an easy fun read with likeable characters.  If a girlfriend asked me for a book to read while by the pool or just something to get her mind off reality, I'd recommend it.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|We couldn't decide if we were interested in a Bourne movie that didn't star Matt Damon, but were glad we decided to try it.  Try it, you'll like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was looking and looking for it, finally it camw. My hole family loves it . I want to put it on my phone, but it can't go on. Will try again and again.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|Jiggle it a bit to make it work. It is better than the original connection, but the internal connection needs to be better
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|For those of you who know the name Paul McCartney.....You know him as a former Beatle and solo performer with great back-up people like Wings or as just himself doing all the music and vocals. Paul's work has indeed been steady and never-failing...I do feel there were some \\"lulls\\" here and there where his work was just laid back and not that exciting or interesting.....but good. This album, however, is indeed his best yet.....best yet in that every song is a winner and different. I referred to it as his white album.....kind of a way of saying that if he used the songs from this album with the original Beatles and some of their own new songs in 2013 (if they were all well and alive)....you'd definitely have a 2013 Beatles White Album. It really is a gem of an album.....and yes......not \\"maybe\\"....but I AM \\"amazed\\". Thank you Paul......please continue.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game I play on facebook and on my phone but really enjoy it with my kindle! This is my most recommended game for kindle.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I love this album!! Great music! Amazing energy! I think everyone I know loves Mumford & Sons!! Buy it now!!!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I liked the book. I love the way Shephen King writes.  His stories alway have such good rhythm. And he is believable.  This is not fiction - This totaly happened!
B002AKPECW|4.0|I can not entirely disagree with the more critical reviews. But I had a good time reading it. An easy read one can blaze through in a day or so.This might be best described as Speculative Fiction. Clearly a morality play, I was reminded of Roman and Greek mythology.<br />It is no more mystical/magical than the Lensmen series and others from before the days of inexpensive solid state devices.<br />This is a bed-time story, and about as easy to approach. Somewhat like the pulp I was reading in the early 1960s, this is good 'starter' science fiction.<br />Fun characters, fast paced, somewhat convoluted/convenient plot complications with no heavy 'tech-talk' lifting. :)
B008Z7K7R6|2.0|I feel like I got this album for one song, because I was less than impressed with the rest of the album. Instrumentally they're excellent, but the vocals, it's like listening to a dying cat....
B004RL9T50|4.0|Full of humor, fun and action!  We really enjoyed this film.  It's not too often we find movies that are appropriate for all viewers but this one's a keeper.
B009NY43NY|1.0|W.T.H.  Not what I expected, NOT what readers deserved, way to annihilate the character Eric. I will not be purchasing any other books by this author.
B00D1HC8VS|5.0|I had an earlier version of this on CD but it never sounded very good. This version has much better sound, and since it was always good musically, that makes it a good listen. The bonus disc of extra songs is also an extra added goodie.
1416972250|4.0|Out of all the books in this series, this one is my favorite so far. It has so much suspense and really kept me on the edge of my seat. Cassandra Clare did an amazing job of keeping her reader guessing. Also the characters were just so fascinating. Each one had something special about them to make them unique. Also I found myself relating to Clary, the main character. Clare also did an amazing job of creating a mental image in my head of every scene. The only thing that kept me from giving this book a 5/5 rating is because the book didn't really start getting exciting until about a third of the way through. Other than that, it was amazing.
B00FEPQ212|4.0|Those of you who, like me, have little or no interest in joining thousands of skiers of every ability level in a very long and arduous trek in usually freezing conditions, are therefore unlikely to ever find out for yourself why they do it, many of them over and over again.  Especially if you know and love folks who do, here's your chance to find out how they got there, how the experience unfolds for them, why they can't seem to stop once they've started.  It was fun seeing in print references to trail locations I've heard described over the years.  Quite an entertaining read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|VERY FUN! I am so glad that they brought it to The Kindle. It is very addictive and challenges your brain.
0894803123|4.0|Easy to make and yummy recipes!  My only concern is using raw eggs (and I can't find pasteurized eggs at my store).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Drama, comedy and best of all it's not full of filth and disgusting language so I can watch it with my teens.
B0035TXT1K|5.0|such a mind bender great to watch in any state of mind definitely a re watch and tom cruise is great hahah
B00881VLCE|2.0|I loved this game until I got the 5 for 1 deal for $4.99 and now the game only crashes every time I open it. I can't play at all anymore.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the story until this died. I hated that. Terrible ending. If she and Tobias had survived, it would have been my favorite book.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I enjoy matching games - find them relaxing at the end of a long day.  And this one has just enough variety so does not get boring.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I can't put it down. I hope I can play not  than 10 levels after I write this review!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are an absolutely ridiculous value. If you listen to many types of music and it do any recording/mixing, they are great. I would recommend these over most $150 to $200 headphones I've tested.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Challenging! I like that you can start a game over again (and again...) make sure you collect the jewel in each game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|very funny!! It's a drug! Download it! But it's a litle difficults play with the tablet! With a fring is more easy. So play it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I would tell everyone that they should play . Great way to pass the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!! GETS REALLY CHALLENGING as you progress and that's what I look for in a good game. Try it and you'll be hooked!
B002MFV2IK|5.0|It's an oldie but a goodie. If you never seen this movie I suggest you buy or rent it soon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm hooked on Pinterest!! I have over 5000 pins & I've used over 1000 of them!! Inside the house & out. The entire family has been effected! I've even got mor fit & I'm running 5k's.
B00004WORQ|5.0|2 songs, 28:36 minutes of floating music.<br />&#34;Formless and empty&#34;; this is best description of the disc, void and ethereal sounds.<br />Sergio
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great book, fast read that will stay with you long after you finished. An incredible storyline with characters that make you laugh and cry !
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I never knew that Hugh Grant could sing. He has a beautiful voice. And Drew Barrymore can sing a little. She's not that bad. I listen to these songs all the time. He is sexy and has a sexy singing voice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's all that and a bag of chips! It's not that bad of an app, try it out! Plus, if you don't like it, it's not like you paid $10 or some other ridiculous price for the app, so you could delete it! Never know if you don't try, and you'll never if you don't know! But now  you do so test it out! Give it a chance!
B00866JL96|5.0|I love this movie. It was funny, romantic, drama And it tells you a story that could be true some where. I tell everyone to watch this movie. Zac Efron, was brilliant in this movie. I think this was the best movie he ever stared in a long time. And his co-star was awesome too. They showed a lot of chemistry between them. Would love it if they made another romantic movie together again.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is a fantastic inexpensive processor.  This doesn't have hyper-threading so if you are looking for that don't bother with one.  But runs great and windows 7 agrees.
1444737112|5.0|I have not read all of this book yet, but so far it is very interesting.  I bought these books as gifts for cat people friends.
B005R9HK8O|5.0|Awesome book- bought the ebook and then paper book copy since some of the illustrations and stuff are neat. :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This it one of the best apps you will ever get. If you like subway surfer and temple run you will love this game. In this game they mixed a little of  both of these games. You run like you would in subway surfer when you are on foot but if you are on a ride you will run like you are in temple run.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun app and gives you a bit of knowledge because you have to be able to match and think while the clock is ticking down
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is one of those movies I could watch over and over and experience new things and nuances to the storyline. Always anticipating those scenes when love surpasses mere words and with a thought, a look, it speaks volumes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A wonderful piece of writing. I was not able to look away. Just the way I expected for you again.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Again Dan Brown does not disappoint!!! He takes you on a rollercoaster ride that keeps your full attention from beginning to end!!  The most shocking being close to the end and I must say I gasped out loud!! This book was a pick from one of the members in my book club and I actually sent him a text at that very moment and he text back simply \\"I know\\"!! Again, I don't give a five star rating very often but this book deserves it and much more. Any book that can peak your interest about the world around you and keep you guessing for days on end, is a good book in my book!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am completely shocked and frankly outright astonished by this book. Ever since I discovered divergent, I had completely sold my soul. Ever struggle and event and beautiful sentence tugged st my heart and made me learn and fall in love over and over. Even th  beginning of this book, even with Tris's betrayal, everything seemed right. Like it needed to happen for it to seem more real. However, I cannot. Will not. Do not believe that Tris needed to die in ANY way. I may just sound like a heart stricken teen, seeing only what I want to and excluding th  insightful and symbolic touching aspects that appeal to those more mature than I, but I can ensure you that I am heavily underestimated. I can see and empathize with those things only fathomed by adults, and I see and hear and understand more than most adults. This was heart wrenching, and not in
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|More than met my expectations. VERY easy to set up. Life saver when it comes to entertaining a six year old who wants his favorite cartoon & I have to get it off the internet because I don't subscribe to that channel.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Setup was extremely easy, so that part they got right.  But 90% of the time when I try to use the device, the audio is missing. The other times it says it's not available to display.<br /><br />So hasn't been the best experience for me.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|I'm not only a close follower of Richard Dawkins,  I also actively support his cause for science and reason. This might brand my review as biased, but I'm quite confident about my fair opinion.<br /><br />This book is a magnificent essay devoted to explaining just about everything, in layman's terms, about the origin and evolution of life and should be part of every sceptic's collection (not to mention atheists). I doubt many creationists will read it, so the wonderful knowledge won't be spread where it's most needed.<br /><br />My only criticism has to do with Dawikns' exaggeration on detail. Most issues are well argued after the first few pages in the chapter, but Richard goes on with numerous examples and references which, in my humble opinion, end up being redundant. This makes the book a bit tiresome at times.<br /><br />Other than that, the Greatest Show on Earth is a must read for everybody.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love games and my son-in-law and granddaughters and grandson say it is great fun.  I expect to try it this weekend.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|Every episode is about the same. With the exception that a star is taken by the dead and it is usually about the time you want to pull the plug. They also seem to pick up a few new people along the way so they have someone to get bit by the walkers.<br />I can not believe that there is a 4th season.<br />I am only watching this because my wife doesn't want to watch it alone.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This was the kind of book I read just to get to the end, to find out. Some good twists and turns but I didn't like any of the characters, and that made it hard to connect with the story. It is a memorable read however.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Great acting, very intriguing story, nice twists, nice action, nice writing, etc. This was really just a bad ass movie. One of Cruise's best.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Not every ending can consist of eating rainbows and pooping butterflies.  What a boring world this would be if everyone painted happy endings.  The ending though absolutely heartbreaking was actually quite true to the characters and series. &#34;An ending, not surprising among the Dauntless.&#34;  I look forward to Roth's future works.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Spoilers! I discovered these books literally 2 days before Allegiant was due to come out. I'm a new fan if ever there was one, but Tris and Tobias deserved better. Better than this lack luster build up to a pointless tragic end. These books were full of loss and pain from the beginning. Why do that to the fans? Lazy repetitive writing to a ridiculous build-up and sad tragic loss. I would have recommended this series over the Hunger Games which I love but now I'll tell anyone just skip it. Its A HUGE LET DOWN. To those claiming LET it sink in ,did that and got the t-shirt and I still hated it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am so angry. And like so many reviewers, this is not just about the ending which I will get to in a minute. I had invested myself emotionally in these characters - the premise of the factions, the first two books even with the moping and self loathing that took place in Insurgent, I was on board. The ending of Insurgent meant I wanted resolution and from the opening chapters of Allegiant it became clear that we were just going on a pointless merry go round with more contrived enemies, more of the same bad choices that both Tris and Four make. The entire plot line of Allegiant is weak and unbelievable. I also agree with everyone who said they couldn't discern the POV owner from the writing style. After I read Divergent I read Free Four and there was so much of his character there than in this book where he gets more than half of the chapters.<br /><br />Now onto the ending. So pointless. Peter gets to live, Caleb gets to live, Marcus gets spared, even Evelyn gets her happy ending. Life is unfair and I am not just angry because the no happy ever after, but that one decision (which Roth maintains she'd always planned) just unraveled the whole point of the first two books for me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow! That is the most emotional ending I have ever read. And it is not one I'll forget for the rest of my life. I am not talking about tears rolling down my face, I'm talking about full on sobs. But as sad as it is, it was a genius ending. Veronica took a huge risk writing that ending, but unlike other people who hated it, I understand why she did. Life is not always happily ever after. It is a very real ending. Congratulations Veronica, it was a great trilogy, but it will be awhile before I can revisit it. I also hope the bad ratings do not affect your movies, because I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the movie in March.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For the first time in my long reading life, I wanted to read a book again as soon as I finished it.  The only thing that stopped me from beginning Ready Player One again was that it was 11:30 at night when I finished and I had to get up and be ready for a tournament by 6:00 a.m.  Loved it in February (purchase date), offered it as a book club selection (we read it in May - still loved it), and read it again in September, still love it.  I do not understand all the 80s references (too busy raising toddlers and young kids during the 80s) but it was enjoyable whether I knew the referenced movie/song/game or not.  Wonderful characters.  Great  plot.  Highly entertaining.  And each and every time I read it, I want to re-read it again as soon as I've finished.  Wow.  I can't recall a book that I've not only read three times in one year (and it may be more--the year isn't over yet!), but still feel as strongly after the third reading as I did the first reading.  Thank you, thank you, Mr. Cline.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were stay awake and read page turners this one was not.  Not that I love the ending but would have been fine with it if the rest of the book was exciting like the other two.  I can't remember a point where I couldn't put it down but kept waiting for it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its relly fun but it gets harder as you go on but like I said verry verry verry fun hope you injoy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's precisely what I was looking for. Simple, good looking game, that relaxes my mind. Thank you, I'll buy more.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is the most frustrating game I have ever played. Even so it is also very addicting and most of the time fun. It makes you determined to win. I really do enjoy it and can't just ignore it. It pulls you back every time you think you are not going to play anymore. Eventually I get my way even after several lives are lost. lol
B00DWHWOFC|4.0|It would be nice to be able to check off rows and columns we know to be right. Otherwise great variety and good challenge.
0316322407|5.0|I appreciate any book that helps me \\"travel\\" somewhere I could not otherwise go, and this one is an incredibly vivid account of life inside the Swat Valley of Pakistan.  It gives a fresh perspective to some pretty incredible recent-history events that all of us read about in the news (earthquake, flooding, Taliban propaganda then violence) -- it's hard to imagine what the people are actually experiencing until you read a first-hand account, I guess.  I also found it interesting to hear the Pakistani viewpoint on various U.S. decisions and acts, such as the Bin Laden raid in Abbottabad.<br /><br />Most of all, this book is an \\"on the ground\\" picture of what it's like to grow up in a country where education is a precious gift, not a taken-for-granted guarantee, and what society is like when so many remain uneducated.  Malala's mother is illiterate, she's surrounded by clerics and religious zealots who think girls should not learn and instead should be hidden away from public view at all times, schools are constantly bombed and crusaded against, and her town is finally taken over by a violent group that seduces the people then forbids girls from learning anything at all.  The government is for some reason completely powerless to sort out these problems.  We all need to do something!  Education for children should never be a life or death matter.

B00FPH6AXE|1.0|A real disappointment.Special effects can not save this film. The movie has no real redeeming acting, plot or story. Save your money. The young Smith may have a future as an actor but he misses the mark on this one.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It took u long enuff amazon. Haha this game is very addictive. U will never want to put it down add to your list
B008JFUR10|3.0|Honestly I haven't watched the movie yet, but I hear the video and audio quality are amazing.<br /><br />The reason for this review is to note that the digital copy does NOT work in iTunes. It isn't very clearly noted in the product info, and I am very disappointed in this (-1 star for Amazon not clearly noting this, and -1 star for Warner Brothers not allowing iTunes digital copy). It's fine if you use UV and flixster, but I do not, and do not intend on doing so (it does not work on Apple TV, which sometimes I just want to watch a movie on iPad, etc, where my library is all together - not spread out over a bunch of services). Luckily, this copy includes a standard definition regular DVD, which you can copy into an iTunes format for your personal use.
B00G32OER4|1.0|I've never written a review on a movie, but this movie was so horrible that I felt compelled to for the first time.  I really expected a somewhat decent movie after all of the hype and good reviews.  WOW. I wasn't scared for a second and found the entire body of work phony.  Bad acting, campy exorcism scene, predictable scares.  I actually outright laughed at the &#34;scary&#34; scenes. The CGI was the only ok part of the movie.  Take it from me....a waste of time and money.  Re-watch the Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose to get the kind of scare this kind of movie should give you!
B00A27X972|5.0|This novel was written in the first person from the aspect of an alien life form here on earth in England.  The author, Matt Haig, was very good at keeping in character as the story evolved and kept me in anticipation throughout the whole story.  Although I did disagree with the writers views on God, I feel it is each man's/alien's personal choice and therefore it did not disrupt the flow of the very well written and engaging story.  I am going to look in to some of Matt Haig's other writings, now that I have had a taste of his work.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Its like sweet valley high got caught in a train wreck with shitty skinemax. I can't believe I spent money on this drivel. The only thing that made it tolerable was to read one chapter of this and then one chapter of the parody \\"shades of beige\\" book (which, incidentally is spot on and hilarious).<br /><br />Can I get my money back already? I'd like some reimbursement for my lowered IQ.<br /><br />If you'd like adult erotica head on over to Judy Blume's adult books...seriously folks, the woman can write some hot shit.

B007HACDLK|5.0|just a fun read. kept me intrigued through out. I highly recommend this book. I've never read a Vince Flynn book that I did't like.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|You would have to be pretty dumb to be surprised by the &#34;twists&#34; in this film.  It's just a bloated, ridiculous &#34;magician as superhero&#34; thriller with fast cuts and a driving soundtrack attempting to substitute for actual action.  And the plot has so many holes and loose threads that afterward you're left saying &#34;hey, what about that....ah, never mind.  Stupid movie.&#34;
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! Very insightful with historical facts and a continuing story line, that always kept my interest. Very easy and quick read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Amazing dragons. I love the Karos idea. Easier to get gems than in most games.I would recommend this to anyone. I only have one problem. My park is stuck in April. And it is October right now.. I hope the new update fixes this. Crossing my fingers!
1401938906|2.0|Yes, explaining complicated subjects can be easier with a sense of humor. But trying to be funny, silly, or cute in every paragraph gets old after a few chapters.<br />I did the experiments totally open minded, with the exception of playing with coat hanger dowsing rods. Nothing jumped out at me, no messages,no little gifts, etc.<br />I don't mind the early statements about God vs god, that God is not a bearded man torturing His children for fun. I agree with that. What turned me off were actually other little things. One was (I think) a crack aimed at Clarence Thomas. I won't explain who he is, I'll just say the joke was lost on me and seemed insterted for the heck of it. I kept reading. Author states a longtime rule of physics: Like attracts like. Really? Excepting the very recent news in theoretical physics that sometimes like DOES attract like, anyone who has taken grade school science knows that when you try to stick to positive or negative poles of magnets together they repel. That was my first clue that the book is another \\"send love waves out into the universe and you'll get love back\\" types. I think my interest finally dropped when the author quoted Michael Moore, yes the hate filled \\"filmmaker\\" who only crawls out of McDonald's long enough to trash the country and our military. Moore said his New Year's resolution was to get people to stop supporting our troops overseas. What kind of \\"love\\" and groovy good vibes is Moore sending out?<br />So now I am wondering if the theory of attraction works the opposite of what the authors of this type tell us. I'm no saint but I have spent my life trying to please others and rarely was selfish. I'm not doing too bad, yet I have never attracted the kind of luck, love, gifts, whatever it is called. I actually attract losers who manipulate and con me.<br />How can this law of attraction explain the downright hateful, mean selfish jerks in the world who always manage to come out on top, get what they want, and never come up smelling like anything other than a rose? Maybe opposites truly do attract, in the world of spirituality also.<br />I am glad I paid for the cheap Kindle version.p smelling like anything other than a rose? Maybe opposites truly do attract, in the world of spirituality also.<br />I am glad I paid for the cheap Kindle version.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Played it on Facebook and now on kindle fire. I'm wondering why people are saying they can't connect to Facebook or get beyond level 35 without paying? I've never spent one dime and I'm on level 167 and connected to Facebook. Anyway it's awesome although sometimes frustrating! Get stuck for weeks but I feel so good when I finally beat it!
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I love this movie. It is so epic from start to finish. I love all the actors and actresses in it- Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Diane Krugar, and Eric Banas. They are so great! This movie is a great and sad story to follow but done very well.
B00B04KVMC|5.0|What an awesome assortment of artists performing incredible music. All on vinyl! The good old days are right now. Buy it.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|It's rather a strange, dragged out story. There is a weird glitch that flings our heroine into a crisis without explanation, and that forms the real drama of the story. There is too much repetition of information and too much thinking without action. Yet the story moves slowly along and develops the main characters well, ending with a hastily written but pleasing finale.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun you don't need the Internet to play which is a plus if your trying to watch your data
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator!  It goes everywhere with me because I always have my kindle fire with me.  excellent when I was on vacation and needed to balance check book.  and the numbers are big and easy to read.  And easy ; just and easy tap of the fingers and you have it!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|So this isn't a terrible book. But it could have been better. Here's the thing: the way Roth handles the ending, in my opinion, was just so unnecessary. I don't understand what this new fad is with killing off protagonists in the final book of a trilogy just because the author can. Sometimes I truly think that's why they do it. That's why I knocked off one star.<br /><br />Here's the other annoying thing: I don't think Roth is a bad writer. But this book could have used an editor that actually told her the honest truth about her use of VOICE. I mean, switching between Tris's perspective and Tobias's was a good idea and could have been powerful - if we could EVER tell a difference between who was who! She used the EXACT same voice between both characters - same tone, attitude, everything. I had to constantly look back at the chapter opener and remind myself of who was talking. That's why I knocked off a second star.<br /><br />So...the rest of the book was pretty good. I love the way she handles Tris and Tobias's relationship, actually. But the book could have SHONE. It really could have. And it missed that opportunity by two stars.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Love that I can listen to it on phone with the cloud app, in the car on cd.  Love the vinyl version as well.  Highly recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was amazing! A perfect end to the story. Why does every book require a fairy tale ending, especially when real life is not? I have literally counted down the days for an entire year for the release of Allegiant. Let me tell you, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />I love Veronica Roth's style for these books. They are easy to read and keep up with, I didn't even have to go back and read the first two because she gave some reviews of them without boring the story line. I love the characters and the plot. Tris and Tobias have a REAL love story, nothing that is annoying or too good to be true.<br /><br />This book leaves no loose ends and I loved it! I have no clue why everyone is giving such low ratings. Get over it! This book portrays life for what it is and what it can dole out and how much we can take before we break!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game. had heard about it, but was not available. now that i have it understand all the fun people are having playing.
1476727651|5.0|I definitely enjoyed this read. It's great as a stand alone, but also as the intended sequel to The Shining. I enjoyed reading King's matured writing style contrasted with the cringe-inducing gore and &#34;scary&#34; aspects of The Shining. And just when you think it's getting predictable, King keeps you guessing. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've read few books in modern fantasy or fiction that truly made me look at myself..  The best review I can give is that this is one of those few.  It isn't high fantasy: rather, it's a look into the heart of those who are &#34;different,&#34; by birth, chance, or choice.  I haven't felt as strongly about a character or story since the first time I reads Ender's Game as a young child.  The feeling, the knowledge, that no matter what you do, no. Matter how hard you try, you can't save everyone.  Thank you, Sanderson, for truly understanding the abandoned, lost, but still hopeful heart of the outsider.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The story gives a good view of what it was like during WW1 and the political complications of those times.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|This is easy reading and at times exciting. Their were heroes in the book which are still heroes. Great reading for baseball fans and for those interested in aviation history.
1433502410|4.0|I bought this book for my dad. He was happy to receive it and is now thoroughly enjoying it. Thanks!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|The variations of time and place in this book combined to make it easy to understand and well worth reading. It is worth while as a reference book.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This was the worst ending to a trilogy that I have ever read. The story dragged and was boring until the end and the the ultimate twist destroyed the entire series. The characters and the readers deserved so much better than what Roth put into it. I truly believe this may have been career suicide for Veronica Roth. I have no doubts I will never bother with another of her books; I am so angry with how Veronica ruined this tremendous story.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stop after the second book! This series could have ended phenomenally with a couple of good twists focused on love, determination, the power to rehabilitate humanity and community but ultimately she managed to destroy the story. Veronica Roth what were you thinking??
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Informative to those who thought Martha Stewart was going to a farm. This may not be hard time but it reads like it's awful time. Easy and quick read but made me feel very uncomfortable for our society.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I think this is one of the best disney films I have ever seen.And I absolutely loved it.so my answer is YES!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had been playing this game on my Samsung phone,  but it's much better on my kindle. When playing on my phone it would freeze or go into super slow mode anytime someone would call or text. Super glad to not have any issues thus far on the kindle.
006202406X|1.0|I was very, very disappointed in this, the third installment of the Divergent trilogy.  A story that began with such promise ended with tedium and melodrama worthy of the world's worst soap opera.<br />As soon as I saw that this book, in contrast to the first two installments, had dual narrators (Tris and Four) it became obvious that Tris' days were numbered.  Why else but to have a means to continue the story after the death of Tris would Roth suddenly give Four a first-person voice?<br />It's inconsistent and distracting that Four has now become a first person narrator.  Roth should have just maintained consistency and ended the story with Tris' death instead of dragging the story on via Four's morose acceptance of her death and the changes in his world.<br />That said, what Roth really should have done is trashed this boring conclusion and started anew.<br />I would NOT recommend this trilogy to anyone now.  Too bad.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|It was typical horror movie. Nothing to brag about but, I did enjoy it much better than the original. I would probably watch it again.
B005HJ6MRO|3.0|This app is great to view your own content anywhere you want. I noticed especially with big files (videos) that it can't fully buffer and the video will lag.
B00EVPSJOE|3.0|This album is very special not only because it gave importance to the unplugged format, but because Eric Clapton reunited with his reputation of bluesman, which almost went unnoticed during the previous decade.<br />Personally, this is an album that forever changed my appreciation for music and particularly by acoustic guitar and how to make blues without electricity.<br />That´s why I think than this could be more special reissue because the pictures inside are exactly the same as 21 years ago, there is nothing new in it. Neither can i see any notes for the occasion by the same EC or some famous music critic or journalist of shows to commemorate this special issue, which is important for any classic album.<br />The importance of this album in the EC catalog deserved something much better.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Just love Downton Abbey. Great TV  to show the Americans how to TV! Classic, true and great scenery. Will watch all episodes.

B00ER23UYA|3.0|I was so looking fwd. to this album & got the deluxe version.<br /><br />I loved Adele's 19 album, but didn't care for 21: way too intentionally \\"big\\" 4 me.<br />Along the same line, I loved Bible Belt, but couldn't even get thru all 16 songs of Speak a Little Louder, which sounds like an attempt to be a way bigger album 2nd album, like 21.<br /><br />Chasing Pavements & Nothing But a Miracle are 2 of my fav songs of this century<br />& I love the soulfulness Diane displayed in her appearance on Live from Daryl's House, but don't hear any of that Carole King flavor here.<br /><br />I'll try it again, but, just like 21, don't think it'll work for me,<br />though I hope, for Diane's sake, it sells a billion like 21 did.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Don't know what's up with the people who gave this book a low rating. It's awesome. Thoroughly entertaining and educational at the same time. I'm not quite finished yet and I'm already looking forward to the next one!

B00F91G5BS|3.0|Very predictable and not all that scary.  Foreshadowing was actually fore-giving-away.  I would not really recommend it unless you are really super into zombies.
B00CWIMY3O|4.0|This is one of the better shows on television and it is worth purchasing this season if you are a fan of the show.  The production values by itself is fantastic.  However the producer's cut episodes plus the episode that didn't air on television is a bit lacking.  That's the problem with shows that exceed your expectations during the regular on-air season though.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is amazing and really fun  I LOVE THIS GAME I think anybody who can get this game should it is fun and I am really glad I got this game it makes me happy and teaches you how to make a village and it .helps you learn so much GET THIS GAME IF YOU CAN.
0515142247|5.0|A female FBI agent (Holly) is kidnapped outside of her Korean dry cleaners in Chicago.  Reacher, who is innocently walking by, helps her pick up things she'd dropped, and both are kidnapped by three Northern Montana Militia men, who are attempting to secede from the United States and have money to burn, literally in the form of 20 plus million in bank bearer bonds their founder stole and stashed in the Cayman Islands.  Holly and Reacher are bundled into a van and trucked all the way to the Militia's compound in a remote Montana mountain valley where the FBI agent is held for ransom, because she just happens to be the military Joint Chief of Staff's daughter and the god daughter of the sitting President of the United States.  The President has a dilemma.  The FBI agent's his best friend's daughter, but he and his administration don't want to alienate 60 million potential voters, who all despise the government like the militia do.  The President gives the Director of the FBI an off the record, I didn't say this, carte blanche directive to make the whole situation go away,  The action in Die Trying is nonstop as the author continually ratchets up the violence, intrigue and complexity of the plot as there is not just one rogue FBI agent betraying Holly, but two, as for most of the story the militia are always able to out maneuver the FBI's searchers and eventual rescue attempt.  For Reacher trvia fans, this is the rare Reacher novel where his mentor, General Garber, a three star general by the time of this story, makes a very deadly cameo appearance.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about Die Trying, which did not affect my enjoyment of it, was the relatively quick demise of the four hundred pound, brilliant militia leader who had Reacher's number for much of the story, when Reacher dispatched him with a sniper rifle like a hunter shooting a squirrel.  It would have been very interesting if the author had set Reacher against the militia leader man-to-man in a showdown like he usually does.<br /><br />In my opinion, I think Die Trying is the fourth best Reacher novel: Killing Floor, One Shot, Running Blind and Die Trying.  Without Fail is my fifth favorite Reacher story.<br /><br />Heck yes, I am going to read this one again.  I don't think you will be disappointed as Reacher nobly walks away from one of the few female characters  as brave, resourceful and keenly intelligent as he is who he could fall in love with, because her heart is with a FBI colleague, who is racing to save her but does not know how she feels towards him.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|(I vaguely glanced at all the low stars; OMG, no.  I had no idea what to expect in book 3.  I did not like book 2 nearly as well as book one.  Book 3 was just as good as book 1.  The ending was not what I was anticipating, which I really had no idea what to anticipate.  There are lots of good messages in the book, themes spoken and implied, both.  The book alternates between Tobias and Tris's voice.  With how popular re-writing novels from a second person's POV has become, this was a great idea.<br />We get to see more of Tobias's flaws and insight into him.  I kept hoping those last couple pages would give me a detail I really wanted to see, but it didn't.  That doesn't mean the book isn't still a 5.<br />I will definitely be on the look out for future novels from Veronica.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very good game. Good combination of temple run and subway surfer. Highly recommended. Have it onmy kindle and phone.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|So this just sits here. Why did I go through 20 minutes of ordering it  it doesn't do anything  not even a download link
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Okay, I really give the book a solid 3.5, but I bumped it up to 4 to balance out all of those 1 star reviews. I believe the one-star reviews are way off base. I've read some truly god-awful writing that deserves 1-star. This book wasn't one of them.<br /><br />[Update- Now rounding it down to 3 stars because of all the fake 5 star reviews I'm seeing. At least the 1-star reviews are real.]<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />The book is engaging in that you want to keep on reading to find out what happens. I mean, look how many people finished the book in just one day. It IS interesting. Give it at least that much, folks!<br /><br />However, I agree with the others in that there ARE problems.<br />1) Like other readers, I think Tris' and Tobias' POVs are basically the same for just about all of the book. I found it odd that two different people would think so much alike. Any passage from Tobias' could have come from Tris', and vice-versa. So I, like other readers, had to go back and double-check sometimes to see whose POV chapter I was currently in.<br /><br />2) There are too many rebellions. Honestly, just too many. I don't even know why Tris takes up the Allegiant cause so easily (or at least, participates in without too much questioning) after she just got through with 2 books of fighting against factions.<br /><br />3) Tobias has always been portrayed as a smart guy. One decision he makes seems truly bizarre. For someone who is so thoughtful, his actions really don't make sense.<br /><br />I didn't think the ending was that bad. It was consistent with Tris' personality. However, what makes it less than completely satisfying is that it is very abrupt. It also seems rather random. SPOILER: Kind of like the ending to all quiet on the western front. END SPOILER.<br /><br />oh, well. Not perfect, but not terrible.

B005COO1X6|5.0|Short and super creepy. Loved it! May have nightmares tonight! Wonder when we'll see it again! SK still has it!
0316322407|5.0|I loved this book! It's honest and straight forth, emotional and difficult to hear, but also kind, loving, clear and accessible.  The story is her personal story but she weaves it through a complicated history, convoluted politics, and a people and faith that she obviously treasures and honors.  In telling her story she teaches us about her culture and her home, a picture I've seen nowhere else.  She retells her story, describing her feelings, opinions, and observations, but leaves the conclusions to her audience. When the book ended I felt heartbroken, inspired, humbled, and hopeful.  When I grow up I hope to be more like this amazing young woman.<br /><br />As a side note, I listened to the audio version of the book and must say that Archie Panjabi is fabulous as the narrator. Her voice, emotional inflection, and pacing are flawless, but the tenderness and humanity of her voice add a dimension to the experience that made it even more touching and personal for me. I would strongly encourage anyone looking into the book to consider the audio version.<br /><br />Five starts all around.
006202406X|4.0|Finishing this book gave me an empty feeling. This might be because I've invested so much time, love and energy in to the characters/story or because of the ending. Upon reflection of the series as a whole though, I realize that the ending was exactly how it would reasonably happen. For three whole books, I scratched my head at Tris' decision making (or lack thereof), typical of a 16 year old girl-regardless of the circumstances. She continually frustrated me and made me throw my hands up, like any 16 year old girl would. So in the end, she lived up to what I was kind of expecting from her. Do I wish the series had ended differently? Absolutely. Am I heartbroken? Without a doubt. But am I surprised? Not at all. When I opened Allegiant and realized it was told from both Tris and Tobias's points of view, I knew what was to come. I tried to ignore what my mind was telling me but I couldn't. I even prepared myself going in to the final battle, when Tris and Tobias had their \\"last night together\\", I began to cry. I knew it was coming. That doesn't make it easier but at least we were given that.<br /><br />Roth is no JK Rowling, our generation will probably never find another author of her caliber and ability. But she told a good story and stayed true to who Tris was as a Divergent, a Dauntless and an Abnegation. She was brave, selfless and confusing.<br /><br />Now...do I plan on reading any future novels of hers? Probably not. Her trustworthiness to protect the main characters is now in question and I hate devoting time and energy to loving a character only to lose them in the end. Ask me again when the tears dry.

B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|I brought this book after Catton won the book prize. I was intrigued, and after discovering what the book was about, I brought a sample, which intrigued me so much that I brought the whole book. The Luminaries have given me many hours of enjoyment, suspense and entertainment.<br />Being Australian, I know something of the Gold rushes that occurred down in these Southern lands. It was nice to read about these issues, and also nice to see Catton refer to Maori culture, and treatment of Asian diggers.<br />Not being one who cares or practices much in astrology, I didn't quite know what all the signs throughout the book meant, but it has spurned me to find out.<br />This book is very long, with the first sections being longer then the later sections. I enjoyed every minute though. If you love histories, or detective novels, or adventure stories, you will enjoy this book. In fact I think that most people would enjoy this book.<br />I'm keen to see what Catton comes up with in future!
B006F8HZYK|4.0|I've been a professional writer and a member of Writer Critique Groups.  We regard The Elements of Style as the foremost authority for writing.  It is what settles debates.  We give copies as gifts and prizes.  However, something is starting to bug me about The Elements of Style.  Search for it on Amazon and notice how many different versions pop up.  Having a new edition every years means it's entering the fashion industry.  Also notice how many author combinations there are.  I realize the English language of today is different from 100 years ago, BUT when our Fundamental Guide changes yearly, it's time for something more stable.  I suspect the authors are just trying to sell more books.

B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson never disappoints.  Here is another example of this artist's amazing versatility and remarkable talent.  Arrangements on this album are wonderful and you hear every legitimate bluegrass instrument you can hope for.  Alan Jackson wrote or co-wrote a majority of the songs on this recording and he delivers again and again.  All fans of bluegrass will value this album and those who already love Alan Jackson already will enjoy this special treat.  Thumbs WAY, WAY, WAY up!<br /><br />Thanks, Alan!  Tina V.

B00DKY4LBW|4.0|... and the line that is crosses is actually on the back of the CD! Flip it over a you will see a single line that runs across the back.  This line separates the track listing with the best songs on top of the line and the remainder below the line.  The songs above that line are ridiculously good but then the album changes quite a bit. It slows down for track 6, a song that actually grew on me the more I heard it. Then it becomes very much a pop album with the remainder of AM not feeling like the Arctic Monkeys to me at all.  If you want to listen to this album from start to finish, I highly recommend listening to the songs in a random order.  If you try this, I think you may find that the stuff at the end is easier to handle if it is broken up by the first 5 tracks. I originally gave this 3 stars but after a few more listens bumped it up to 4/5.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that I can finally play this game on a mobile device. I don't have a smart phone and I always play on Facebook so I've been dying to have another way to play. Unfortunately, I can't get it on my nook, so YAY KINDLE!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves with Pendergast was very thoughtful story with a plot that, while being a little far fetched, was a truly believable story.  Preston and Child always are a wonderful read but you need a dictionary.<br /><br />Pat

B00BD99JMW|1.0|To Veronica Roth(author),<br />Before I read this series, I read your other books and I believed that you would make this an amazing series of books. I loved the first and second book, but when you made Allegiant (SPOILER ALERT), I was heartbroken at the ending. You took advantage of us readers and took away our imaginations. I stayed up all night sobbing about this book. When my friend read it, she felt awful and caught a cold. I officially hate the Divergent series now. Oh and THANKS FOR LEAVING ME HEARTBROKEN! I really believed in you Veronica. How could you do this to us? Tris didn't deserve to die. It's normal for main characters to die in books, but not when the main character dies and ruining other people's life. I HOPE YOU HAVE A NICE DAY VERONICA!<br />  -heartbroken reader,Madi
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|My all time favorite book from my all time favorite series!<br />Don't judge this book on the horrible movie from the 80's.<br />I've read this book at least 4 times and most likely read it again.<br />If you love science fiction, this book is for you.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|With some real time spent on this, you will gain some mental capacity. I did pretty well on most of the tests anyway so there wasn't a whole lot of upward momentum to gain. Some of the aspects are not incredibly user friendly and some are difficult to get the hang of. The instructions are small and not always clear.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The product works as advertised. At this price point it a good value for money.<br /><br />If more streaming service are offered in the future, this product can become a replacement for cable television.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great! This movie was very funny and we loved the music!!  The characters were super and the musical challenges were great!  A feel good story
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I love this mouse, but after just over a year the scroll wheel developed a stutter.  No matter which direction I try to scroll, it jumps up and down, making it impossible to scroll down a document or zoom a map.  I know mice go bad, but at this price I want it to last longer than a year.  I've replaced it with a different vertical mouse which, while not quite as comfortable, was less than 1/3 the price and still gets my forearm straight.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just for the heck of it, I went to Evoluent's web page and sent them an email.  After verifying I didn't have something installed incorrectly, they're sending me a replacement, free of charge!  Just outstanding customer support - heartily recommend.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am a long-time Amazon customer, but this is the first purchase that got me excited enough to go ahead and write my first review.<br /><br />I own a small videography company, and as my equipment list is growing, so is the number of bags and ridiculous things I to carry to each gig. I do most of my shooting alone, so it is important that I can take everything I need in one trip, and once I'm on location, the less bags open and junk strewn around my clients' conference tables in preparation for their interview the better!<br /><br />Clearly, this bag won't hold my lights, lightstands, tripods, monopod, etc. But what does it hold? I'm so glad you asked! Right now I have it loaded up with 2 Canon 60D's (one with a bracket coming off the side), 5 lenses, 3 batteries and a charger, a Zoom H4n, Zoom H1, 2 Olympus WS801's, a Rode VideoMic Pro, a couple lapel mics and various other audio cables, and of course my card wallet. If I leave a couple lenses behind, I can fit my LCD video monitor in the bag too. This backpack is just fantastic, and at a pricepoint under half of what I'm seeing by other brands. If you have to spend money, you want to spend it on gear... not on stuff that holds your gear... right? But if you need one nice little compact place to carry your most important pieces of equipment, look no further!<br /><br />It's not huge, but it holds more than you would imagine just looking at it.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Holds 2 bodies, 5 lenses, batteries, shotgun mic and several mp3 recorders, etc...<br />- Smallish- but bigger on the inside<br />- $30 short of totally free<br /><br />CONS:<br />- There was no Canon 1Dc inside when it arrived. The 70-200 2.8 IS was missing as well. Called manufacturer and still waiting for this situation to be reconciled.<br />- It doesn't hold my 60lbs of other support equipment.<br />- It doesn't ACTUALLY make you a better videographer, it just makes you look like one.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />If you're reading this, you're lookingfor a backpack for your camera equipment. Get this one. Do it now.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have had an obsession with books like these. They turn my perspective into a movie. The romance, tragedy, and adventure is very story-like. It was sad but thought provoking in the end. Worthy of 10/5 stars.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The Seiko SNK809 is a nice easy to see, comfortable canvas wrist strap that you can wear when working everyday.  It is just the watch for being outside, working on the car, or a nice hike.  If you want to save the dress watch for going out on the town,.<br /><br />Like the automatic winding and the see thru back.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It's been a few days since reading the book and I've had time to let things sink in and really discuss this book with other people.  Having done so, I have more disdain for this book that before.  I feel as though there are so many flaws with this book.  A friend read an interview Roth had where she said in the middle of writing the book she thought it needed to end.  And it read exactly that way.  Like she was mindlessly writing and thought this needs to wrap up or it'll get to long and then just kills Tris.  I'm fine with Tris dieing but she deserved a better death than that.  I hardly even realized she died when I read it.  It didn't register until they got back to the compound and they said she was dead.  Caleb could have came in with the suit and killed David to avenge his sister and get a last word in worth her and apologize and actually show a little remorse.  The whole book isn't very exciting to read it's relatively boring until Tris dies and then it's extremely boring after that.  There are all these points in which there could be a really good scene but she fails to set it up.  Like how were they able to just leave Chicago so easily, or how Evelyn is so easily turned.  If you're going for realism you failed, because neither of those situations are realistic and neither is the ending of the truce.  I just feel as though there is a lot of pointless things you learn in this book that only act as filler.  And why was David never put on trial, he just goes on because he was given the memory serum so everything is fine?  Doesn't Peter reverting back to his old tendencies contradict the reason David got off scott free.  It proves that David should be put on trial because people revert back to their true nature.  I have far more problems with this book than stated but just putting my two cents out there whether it's worth anything or not.
B009WUBERW|5.0|All the old guys doing what they do best...kicking butt and taking names.  Awesome sequel to The Expendables.  HD Quality on the Kindle Fire HD was uninterrupted and the sound quality was superb.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|I'm not one to laugh out loud often, but I did while reading this book - often! It is a very quick read and very entertaining.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|This author knows how to plot a good story. He knows how to deliver just enough character detail without getting boring. He sticks to just one or two POVs and doesn't give you an excuse to put it aside when a new character or section begins. This was designed from the ground up to keep you reading.<br /><br />Even though I was conscious of the author's skilful manipulation of his readers it didn't stop me from enjoying this cracking yarn. No wonder he's one of the top writers in the world today.<br /><br />Greg Barron, author of [[ASIN:B007HFOEOO Rotten Gods]] and [[ASIN:B00BOEI4KY Savage Tide]]
B00AFEY354|5.0|Such a great movie. Funny, dramatic, and great charaterization. Shows real life scenarios that might have been hidden in high school.

B002PJN59M|5.0|A very good demonstration  of the truth of of the mystery our existence here. A good depiction of Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|After the original Sprinkler and Granny Smith I knew I had to get this one as well amd sure it enough it proved correct. Much like the original you need to put out the fires in the town. You get scored by how well you do.<br /><br />In this one, you're driving the water cart across the board where it stops before every fire site and obstacle. At time you may need to bring down or break a bridge to complete the level.<br /><br />The graphics are very nice and clean and controls seem to be easier than in the first as well. Great game to add to the collection!
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I agree with the other comments about the background picture. You can change the ninja background but not on the other games. It is very hard to see some of the games with the yoga picture especially where the light is. Allow a change of pictures and I would give this 5 stars.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|First the good: I really though this was a great idea for a book.<br /><br />Now the bad: It is one of the most poorly-written books I've ever read in my life, and I've been an avid reader for four decades. I've read books in four languages. I feel that I have a basis for comparison.<br /><br />Once I started it, and saw how terrible the writing was, I immediately thought this must have been published by a not-very-picky vanity press.<br /><br />I felt I couldn't give it more than one star due to the writing. Despite this, I would still recommed it as being worth your time if you're interested in how we use social media. I won't stop my own use of social media as a result of the idea this book presents, but I do think these ideas are worth bringing up.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|As a reader of detective novels & whodunits  I greatly enjoyed this non- fiction by Eric Schlosser. Well witten and extremely well researched, the tension during reading mounts and mounts like à Titan II rocket with multiple warheads, frightening the reader als he's taken along this breathtaking , bone-chilling narrative excactly because it is non- fiction!
B002ZG976U|5.0|i love this movie. if you like great music with a great story line, then you should buy it! you wont be disappointed
B00E34A9FU|5.0|I learned about this by purchasing the New Riders of the Purple Sage's CD of their performance at this show. I thought I would pick this up to make the set complete and I'm so glad I did. I wouldn't consider myself a deadhead but I do own some of their stuff including Europe 72 which was my favorite performance until this CD. It comes with a great DVD of the show but be warned, lots of naked Hippies dancing which in itself is not a bad thing, but some shots are not for the weak...you'll see what I mean. If you are a deadhead this is a must.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my new favorite game to play on my kindle fire. You don't need Facebook but it's a good choice to because you can get lives easier.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Awesome great show,llove all the drama and twists and turns,never a dull moment,i has been great catching on on all the beginning episodes

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I have used a few different keyboards and this is the one I always come back to. Great predictive typing and amazing spell check.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an excellent purchase for my household.  We are now streaming videos and other information routinely.  We had some problems in the beginning but that turned out to be issues with my modem and not problems with Chromecast.  I was able to work with the Chromecast technical help to resolve the issue fairly quickly.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a TV with HDMI and USB input but does not have a built-in wireless system. This is so much smaller and less costly than an Xbox or even a Roku or others like that.  This product was the answer to the product I was looking for over two years.  Thanks Google.  Good job.<br /><br />Ed Vernon, New Mexico
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is exactly what I needed.. It works great.. If you are on the fence about buying it.. Do it! It's worth the money...

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A book that is worth reading.  It keeps you guessing throughout.  It is an nice way to explore human interactions and how Psychology in relationships can be so on or off at any given time!  Highly recommend reading it in a book club.  My book club is reviewing it this weekend!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Now you &#34;don't&#34; see me, bcuz there was plenty unseen/unknown/unrealistic and unfollowable, confusing, rushed and scattered at best, glad we didn't waste $$ at a theater.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book started out kind of slow for my taste but overall I ended up loving it so much I couldn't put it down!
B004PGO25O|3.0|This book did not impress me much. Had some good points but glossed over them so quickly they were not all that helpful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting and challenging game I love it. It keeps me from thinking to much and worrying and it's free and fun
B0047SIXGE|5.0|Always a classic and a pleasure to rewatch. Soundtrack, direction and the actors all come together in this masterpiece. Five stars.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Fantastic tracks! Catchy tune! Among of the 3 albums of Katy Perry, This one the best and more mature tracks. Some of the tracks of PRISM is very AMAZING! I really enjoyed mostly of the tracks of this album.
B001JEPVDM|5.0|I felt like this was one of the more devastating and compelling books I've read in a long time.  At the end of the book, I think the takeaway is not the mistakes and the misteps - but more the layers of complexity that are involved in these international crises and the limitations in how we can respond to them.  This work is definitely a courageous piece of writing and it clearly took its toll on the authors.  A must read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was the best book I read. It was sad and funny nice sweet kind .I recommend this book for kids and the public.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|My interest in this book began shortly after I joined a Rotisserie baseball leage.  Despite some places being fairly dry, overall its a compelling story.  Interesting to note that the A's again made the post-season this year.  I think the biggest travesty going on is that the A's can't fill that stadium with such good teams, especially living in Toronto as a Jays fan where they do a good job of packing the fans in with a subpar team. Always next year, I guess.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it's a really great game. The only thing I don't like about it u have to but the gru tokens.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this, although it did start to sputter towards the end. I'd consider this a plot driven book with a few interesting twists. I think Howey has great potential and I'd like to see him continue to see where his imagination takes him while investing in and developing his characters at the same time.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I didn't check the story line out before I read a sample and thought it would be a nice relaxing book. Before I knew it I was pulled into the book and could not lay it down before I finished it. The subject is a contemporary dissection of a subject that leaves you with more questions and empathy. It will leave you with a unforgettable impression of rethinking some things in life that are taken for granted.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was incredibly easy. I used to watch YouTube videos on my computer or phone. Now I always just click \\"Watch Later\\" so that I can watch them on my bigscreen HDTV. Makes viewing them so much more enjoyable. The Chromecast works just like it is supposed to work. I'm gonna buy some for presents this holiday season. At $35, they make a great gift, even if someone is only going to use it occasionally.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautiful setting, great writing and wonderful cast. I watched all seasons in one sitting and can't wait for season 4 to begin.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Story was well written.  Goes to show you never know what could happen in your road of life.  Lies get you nowhere.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|Purchased for a small child and they are pretty cute so I am sure she will love them and have hours of fun playing with them.
B00B7806E4|5.0|Extraordinary series from beginning to end.  Always waiting with great anticipation for the next season.  Bravo!!! Bravo!!!  The British always do TV so well.
B008602KQI|3.0|Enjoyable story, following the book (as best as could be expected).  The book was written in such a way as to make it very &#34;movie friendly&#34; so the real question of success regards the acting.  Acting was believable, and successfully &#34;suspended disbelief&#34; past some production exceptions (especially Jennifer Lawrence).<br /><br />Overall, a worthwhile, enjoyable addition to the Hunger Games entertainment pantheon.

B008M721MS|2.0|I downloaded this app for the HD 7&quot;, and so far I have been pretty dissapointed.  I constantly have to re install due to freezing on the sign in screen that restarting my kindle wont even solve half the time.  This occurs on multiple different wifi connections, i know its not on my end.  Constantly drops calls when i have great connections, and the video freezes more than i care for.  I was kind of counting on this app as a way of communicating back home to the family, as im often in areas with wifi but no cell phone access.  As a matter of fact, its the only reason i bought the hd.<br /><br />Best case scenario, its free video calling thats the best thing in the world when it works.  Worst, i wouldnt waste a cent on the skype credits when the app wont launch or connect properly 75% of the time
0312588887|5.0|loved this book and soo glad to know Barbara Taylor Bradford has several best sellers that I intend to order soon ...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I am so happy that I finally am able to play this on my kindle fire. It works exactly as great as it does on my pc and phone. Highly recommend it for Candy Crush Saga addicts like me.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Compelling novel.  Author really draws you in. It's was my first JoJo Moyes novel and I am planning to read all of her work. I wanted to finish it in one sitting.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I finished this book last night and wanted to wait to write my review after I thought about the book for a little while.  I thought that the book was great, despite the fact that I absolutely hated the ending.  I get how Veronica ended it though, and I don't think it's fair to give the book 1 or 2 stars just because I didn't like the way the author decided to end it.  The sacrifice Tris made was her.  It really shouldn't surprise anybody because that is who she is and who she has been throughout the other two books. Not all books can have happily ever afters and don't hate the book or the author just because you didn't get the ending you wanted.  The book was well written like the others and held my attention.  Books that make me cry and emotional deserves 5 stars!
B0030T0VE8|5.0|I got this as an addition to my collection of miniature animals. It is very detailed, well painted, very cute pose. It looks just like the raccoon that sneaks in to go through our garbage. I got the 3 baby raccoons at Fleet Farm (farm store in our town) and the set together is awesome.
B00BE97ONM|2.0|Read from October 22 to 23, 2013<br /><br />It was okay. Not sure why it has all these great reviews. This read more like a first draft. It needs a lot of editing. There were so many unforgivable mistakes/typos. For example, no one sits.<br /><br />\\"The young girl was sat on his car bonnet.\\"<br />I'm not an English major, but to my ears, that does NOT sound correct. And it's used constantly!<br /><br />\\"He saw that the young man was sat at his desk, using his telephone.\\"<br /><br />And on and on and on.<br /><br />Not a lot of dialogue in the first half of the book. Characters are talking to each other but it's all in the narrative and not dialogue, like the writer is afraid to write dialogue (and sometimes the dialogue is awkward, as if to prove this point). Dialogue is how, we, the reader best get to know the characters.<br /><br />The writer consistently explains the obvious, thinking the readers are idiots, and can't put two and two together. There isn't much reward for the reader.<br /><br />This could have been a better read, maybe even a great read, with a thorough edit. I'd guess no one else read this other than the one who gave birth to it before it was published. Self published? Still, no excuses for the mistakes here.<br /><br />One positive this book did have, was a great pace. And it was interesting enough for me to finish it in a day and a half.<br /><br />Not something I can recommend, but I'm glad I got it free.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|I bought this as a collectable, not a toy- but I think it would work well for older children- as long as they're not rough- I would worry about the horn coming off. It is nicely painted, good detail, good quality- typical for Schleich figures.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing this game in my computer at home and have been requesting this game for my Kindle Fire. Thank you for adding this game. Awesome!!!!! Love it, love it!!!!!
B00E4YT2WA|5.0|Not much I can say that hasn't been said already.  It's a very solid album and effort by Dave and crew.  What I want to review here is the quality of the vinyl copy and packaging.  As I preordered the vinyl, Amazon advertised it as being delivered on release day.  I received an email the day before release saying the vinyl was going to be delayed but I could go download the mp3's (gotta love AutoRip).  I received an email that Friday saying it had shipped, and alas, it was delivered the Monday after release day.  No big since I already had the mp3's.  But upon opening the package, it was apparent that some real thought went into this vinyl release.  Unlike Mastermind, this copy did not include a copy of the cd, but did have a download card for more mp3's.  The sleeve is top notch - very heavy and the artwork appears as it was made for a 12\\" vinyl cover.  It's a gatefold, but I haven't torn off the outer wrapping because I like the MM Last Patrol sticker at the bottom of the front (maybe one day I'll finish opening the sleeve).  The vinyl itself was the biggest surprise.  2 heavy-ish slabs of vinyl in black, poly-lined sleeves.  They even shipped the vinyl correctly so as to not tear the cover during transport.  It is pressed on ORANGE vinyl and looks and plays spectaular.  I highly suggest if anyone is teeter-tottering on purchasing this on vinyl, that they go ahead and buy it.  Who knows how many copies of orange will be pressed.  On the back cover it says in small print at the bottom that it is a \\"strictly limited\\" release.<br /><br />Overall - I'm very pleased with the vinyl copy of Last Patrol.  The music itself is very good.  Much better (in my opinion) than Mastermind.  The quality of the physical product is top notch.  Highly recommend buying.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I fell in love with Bob the instant I began reading Jame's first book & this sequel cemented that adoration!!!! I was so sad when I finished it! I smiled the whole way through the book & with James' beautiful descriptions of Bob's personality, I could vividly picture every adventure! I so hope there will be many more Bob adventures for us to read in the future!
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent all round, well worth a few hours of your life watching it.  Love how Holmes is getting more and more equal with Sherlock in terms of character.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I have it for face book, android and now on my kindle fire!!! I'm so glad that they finally made it for my tablet. Thank you king games such a great game and so addictive!!!
B004LM72ZY|5.0|This is a simple wonderful little toy. We got it as a gift before my son was born, and at the time I thought it was cute but didn't really realize how much he would love it. He has all of these fancy baby toys that light up, sing the alphabet, colors, etc but he could care less about the flashy ones. He loves this rocket. He carries the little guy around everywhere. Young kids do need help with the twist off top to open it but it's not a problem, they pick it up quick.  My 15 month old loves this so much I ordered a few more playmobil sets for him for Christmas. &#34;Spaceman&#34; is definitely one of his favorite toys!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush Saga is fun as it slowly shows the player different ways to form greater power.  I'm still learning.
1480507024|2.0|My opinion of this book (or the TV series) can be fully expressed by the content of the following link - [...]<br />It is a very leftish version of events spanning WW I to the present.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It's a beautiful quilt of stories that teaches us about family bonds-very touching and inspiring story about fate and family bonds that transcends time
B008OM0EDO|3.0|First off, I found Borat HYSTERICAL. Bruno was also funny, but was sometimes just more &#34;uncomfortable&#34; and somewhat of a re-tread. I was expecting the same for The Dictator. I was pleasantly surprised that this was more of a story line, movie type format. There were a lot of laughs, and some familiar SBC humor, which is kind of the point if you are watching one of his movies. Decently done, decent story, enough laughs to keep you interested.<br /><br />For those irresponsible people who are looking to an Amazon Review to decide weather it is okay to show their children, simply because they want to watch it themselves, but don't want to feel like they didn't do their &#34;job&#34;, it should be okay....Not nearly as raunchy as the other two SBC offerings....lol
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Another twist on a classic. Never get tired of fairy tales. Have given this as a gift for my niece.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very fun for the whole family<br />Hours of fun keep it coming great way to learn for all ages today
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Once again the production is top notch!  PBS does these shows better than anyone else!  This season had surprises & the writers keep us involved with the &#34;lords & ladies&#34; of Downton & their servants who toil below.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Great album! Very good songs and overall fantastic product!<br />Highly recommended to people who loves music not only katy Perry's fans!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Being able to get the app on the Kindle Fire makes me very happy.  Not being able to get the app was a disappointment as I enjoyed playing the game with friends.  Love the game.  A favorite..!!!!!!!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Well this app is really REALLY fun I you would think I would give it 5 stars, but I'm kinda annoyed that after you reach a couple levels you have to pay again even though the all itself already costs money! And if you want another character you have to pay to. I think they want a lot more money than people bought the app for.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was just so excited, I even gave myself a day to rethink my feelings and review but I can't even think about ever recommending this series to anyone ever again, for all the reasons already stated. To think I had been looking forward to the book for so long. At least that's 8 less dollars to spend at the movie theater this year.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Get if  you wonder about the pocket inv editor . this is where you get  that stuff<br />like nether reactor core invisible bedrock and more
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent story.  It was unusual because it had many pshchological aspects vs. the chase to the verdict.  I was very interested in the trial court attorneys' strategies in pursuing a verdict.  I recommended this to our daughter to read since she is getting her masters in paralegal studies.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it dragged in many spots, especially in describing characters.  I would certainly recommend this to a friend.  It was recommended to me by our book club.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has the same things as regular minecraft but has a nether reactor core a<br />camera glitch stone invisable bed rock and more
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My sister plays it on her iPad but doesn't let me play. I went on the app store but they didn't have it. I am very glad that they have it for kindle.SO ADDICTING!!!!!!
B0002KVUKM|5.0|good movie with suspence humor and plot twists  not focused on one threat but multiple theats i found it very entertaining
B005T87QCI|5.0|The game is awesome just like the movies. I recommend for you to save 99 cents to get the chance to build your own robot.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|very funny movie almost slap sick  its people makeing fun of something from their culture not making fun of someone elses culture
B00992CF6W|5.0|Before I got the game I thought 6.99 was too expensive for a game. When I played it for the first time I thought to myself&quot;wow,this is the best game ever!&quot; YOU NEED TO GET IT!!!It is worth every cent!
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Flipboard is among the best news aggregator apps out there for the iPhone and Android -- I've used it on both -- but not for the Kindle, unfortunately. On my new Kindle Fire HDX the app simply does not work. It loads headlines, but no articles. I'm using Newshog instead, which works as advertised. Amazon should make it a basic requirement that any app sold in its app store actually work on Amazon hardware.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I think that I had never suffered so much reading a book until Allegiant; however, it was a heroic tragedy, the sacrifice had a purpose and a lovely message. I have read sad books, full of deaths that made me cry to sleep before, but, believe me, this was a harsh read. I almost considered throwing myself at the author at times and spent a whole lot of time swearing and sobbing throughout the book.... Anyway, you must read it: it is an important book and it certainly makes you think.
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|Monster Magnet made, to my ears at least, an absolutely stunning return with 2010's 'Mastermind' after 3 or 4 rather lackluster efforts. I'm pleased to repot that 'Last Patrol' ups the ante with a stunning collection of songs. While nothing that Dave Wyndorf does in 2013 will be comparable to Spine of God/ Superjudge/Dopes to Infinity this new one comes WAY closer to that trilogy than I thought would ever be possible. It is, as you'll have read if you are a fan, a more psychedelic cd than previous MM efforts, but it's still got quite a good bit of crunch. The best way I can describe it as a more mellow 'Superjudge' recorded by guys who probably weren't stoned out of their minds when making it! Support a great band and buy it. Buy 2 copies!!
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|Amazon reviews really let me down on this one. Bad acting by mostly good actors, reprehensibly stupid story line that doesn't even try to hold itself up... I watched 30 minutes and walked. Yeah, I want that time back, but I want to unsee what I just saw. Seriously.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Simply put I loved the story..  May every life be touched with a silver lining.  Kudos to Matthew Quick we all love a happy ending.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved reading this book. I finished it in two days!!! Every person should get a chance  to read this book.
B000W967UQ|4.0|While this is a fun book and quick read, it is not as well-written as many of the other (especially the more recent) Discworld books. If you are a fan of Pratchett or the Discworld series it is well worth picking up.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I had never heard of these series before it was suggested on my Kindle Fire HD becaus of books I'd read. I read City of Bones and was entrenched in the story so I got the CoA as well. A really good read for fantasy lovers.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I can't begin to tell you how long I waited for this book. I suppose it was as long as everyone else who rushed to buy it the first day it was out!  I would have given this book 2 stars, but because the first two books were so good, I bumped it to 3 stars.  The more I stew about this book, the fewer stars I'm tempted to give. I feel robbed of my happily ever after. And it has seriously put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day...  UGH... just... UGH!!
B009CGGHL4|5.0|Shaun of the Dead was the first Simon Pegg movie I ever watched. He and his &#34;cheeky&#34; fellows are hilarious. This has become a cult classic in my personal a opinion. A must watch for comedy and horror fans everywhere!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|this movie is so true to the book! I think Jennifer Lawrence plays a great part and does an amazing job!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Over the top hilarious movie. I was thinking it was gonna be a lame dancing and singing movie, but I can say that I've never been more glad to be wrong. Very funny movie with some great singing. And it doesn't hurt that most of the women are really hot
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing just simply the best book ever I could not put it down even to do home work I loved it
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|So happy she finally made a new record. I'm in live with Mazzy Star. Her hauntingly beautiful voice always makes things better. I hope she doesn't wait too long for her next record.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Awesome. I taped them all on VHS in the early 80s. That didn't work out so well. These remastered versions are a treat to see today!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This series was shot lived but loved in my family. It is one of the most realistic high school shows ever written. I fell in love with every character. Clair Danes portral as a girl full of teen angst was perfection.
B005OP7162|5.0|This is a good sit down watch, with a lot of getting even type of life, that all of us, who want to do sometime like this to get someones attention that might just have it coming to them.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Loved It. Couldn't put it down. Would highly recommend to anyone. It leaves you wanting more and more. Great Read.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|great item to have on your kindle to look up a words than using a book which usually is now where in site.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I just love this game. It is very very addictive.  I just can't stop playing.as soon as new lives are available<br />.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't have the game for along time and couldn't understand all the hyper about it.  But now I have on my phone and kindle. And now I can understand all the hyper. I can't get enough of the game.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Because addictive...fun and challenging but not too hard. Posted with my son and he really enjoyed it also.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|I find this soundtrack the most amazing futuristic type of music ever, daft punk never disapoints, i listen to it daily, i highly recomend the movie and the sound track.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It solved the problem of my kindle not charging. amazon customer service helped trouble shoot the issue and got then on it's way to me quickly
044024367X|4.0|I had a lot of fun reading this Reacher story. I thought I'd read all the third-person Reacher novels, but somehow, this one slipped by me. I'm glad I found it. The flow was mostly fast-paced though it tended to drag a bit in the middle. I liked the side character, Vaughan. The bad guys DID seem a bit wimpy and weren't much of a threat, but despite all, the story kept me glued to my seat. The way it turned out kind of came out of left field for me, and I don't mean that in a political way, though after reading some of the negative reviews, I can see where one might interpret it that way. Reacher shows a bit of philosophical feeling that a few take as the author preaching through the character. I didn't see it that way. Oh well...<br /><br />This story didn't seem as passive as some of his other novels, though it was full of his trademark \\"He said nothings\\" and his liberal use of \\"K-turn\\" when he gets a chance. The head-hopping wasn't too flagrant or distracting.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to continue reading to see what would happen next. The ending was satisfying enough. I suspended my disbelief only enough that I didn't have to stop reading and go \\"Hey, wait a minute\\" mainly because I'm no expert at most of the technical issues he used and I know this is no technical manual. Finally, it left me with a smile on my face. Couldn't ask for better than that. A lot of people really despised this book. It hasn't stopped me from seeking out his next third-person effort! Recommended.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I enjoyed this game because of its fast pace play.Your given 1 minute to score as many 3 or more groups of a certain color.  You can also compete against other people. It's fun, get it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This App did everything I needed it to do and then some, my tablet is running much quicker than before I installed Clean Master. Great job
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|2013PG13: Once again, a movie that sucked so bad I had to rate it. The acting was 'ok', and the story-line 'so ... so ...', but the monsters ..., the sets ..., the sub-titles ..., the camera shots ... sucked, sucked, sucked, and ... (wait for it) ... sucked! The unnecessary multi-cultural attempt to 'include-everyone-in-this-fight' was totally unconvincing. Warner Brothers, what were you thinking when you signed off on this? Soooo wish I hadn't paid to see this BOMB! Ugg MFJLabs 2x
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Excellent book. John Green masterfully describes a very delicate topic, the text is interesting, deep and can be a great collection of quotes.
0761169253|1.0|This is the ultimate dumbed down how-to-get-famous book. It assumes that its readers are pathetic no-talent losers & tells them how to cut, copy & paste (mostly off the web) their way to 'creativity' as a substitute for imagination & discipline. And the suckers are (sadly) eating it up. We truly live in a derivative age.
B000002JB3|4.0|I'd rate this album MORE THAN three and a half stars as a Phil Collins solo album. If this were a Genesis album I'd rate it three stars, but it's Phil Collins...<br /><br />This one is really surprising. He threw his hat fairly and squarely in the &#34;Adult Contemporary&#34; ring on the prior &#34;Both Sides&#34; album.<br /><br />&#34;Dance into the light&#34;, however, changes everything. Rather than every song being a &#34;Build up&#34; song that last five minutes plus, &#34;Dance into the light&#34; feautres many shorter songs, making this a more punchy, invigorating album.  And none of it is Adult Contemporary balladry.<br /><br />&#34;Wear my hat&#34;, &#34;Take me down&#34; and the title track are Latin- brassy songs that are a nice change of pace (although the title track suffers from the vocals not meshing into the song well). &#34;That's what you said&#34;, &#34;In Your eyes&#34; and &#34;Love Police&#34; are british guitar pop at it's finest.<br /><br />The big surprise was the epic &#34;Just another story&#34;, which is close to 'Urban Hymns', featuring lyrics about the downsides of NOT TAKING parental advice - definitely a stretch for Phils' repertoire. &#34;Lorenzo&#34; and &#34;The river is wide&#34; are world music tunes and &#34;The same moon&#34; is a haunting track with lead guitar so beautiful it will send shivers up your spine.<br /><br />He also covers &#34;The times they are a-changin&#34; - well that's ok but it's one of those timeless tunes and covering it will always leave you off second best. One of the songs is a five minute plus progressive rock track, which he asked someone else to sing for him - a huge misstep; the vocals don't mesh at all in this song.<br /><br />Overall, the sound is good, the songwriting is top notch, the singing is very good ( a little bit nasally but that's not his fault) and good variety and a good variety of tempo's. A great release from Phil Collins and highly recommended if you like his music. That said, manypeople are disappointed with this album, who like his early 80's albums (I don't know why), so before you splurge money on buying you best hear some samples.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|Matthew loved it then again he loves Selena as a nine year old!  He also recently saw her in concert and she does a great live performance for kids.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am really enjoying playing this game. However, it's easy to get addicted to it. It is a lot of fun playing it with friends and family.
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|I have not had time to finish watching the whole story but it is set up well so far and I look forward to finishing it soon.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Loved it. Good acting, nice build up of plot and it hasn't even got started yet. Worth every cent.<br />Pauline
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Very interesting and hard to put down book. I started it and finished it in the same read. I would absolutely recommend as a very smart, thoughtful and well researched book about how we often misconstrue events. Kind if reminds me of freakonomics on completely different topics. Gladwell at his best.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I enjoy reading Malcolm Gladwell's books very much and preordered this book when it was still in the works. Read it as soon as it appeared in my Kindle. Liked it as all other books. Many metaphors he uses stick with me and I use them in my own conversations -- to make my point clear.
B00CXQL828|2.0|I was disappointed. The music is great till the verse and chorus starts. I thought it was gonna be kick ass but it's less than half the umph I thought it would be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Most addictive game ever! Give it a try. You will not be able to put it down. I found myself playing into the wee hours of the morning the first few days!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Always love Sanderson's stuff. This is no exception. To bad it's only the beginning and the is not out till  fall 2014, argh!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I LOVE this movie!!! I think everyone should see it at least once. You'll make it part of your life. Cult classic for sure!
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|This is a VERY basic note taking app. Will work great for making lists and I love to make lists. I also noticed on my Kindle Fire HD, when this app is on the top of the carousel, the &quot;customers also bought&quot; bar goes away. Welcome benefit.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|the visual effects are as good as that of the transformers. the story is way better than that of the transformers. overall, awesome!
B000FBJHT4|5.0|This book did a lot to peak my interest in the Roswell event - lots of credible information and answers to questions  never asked including names of people, events and timelines.  A very good read if you are at all interested in the history of Roswell or the effects  on today's society.<br />I recommend.
006202406X|2.0|I think Veronica Roth either didn't like being a popular author or was trying to shock the heck out of readers so her version of a dystopian future would be remembered. Unfortunately, if the latter is the case, I think she just ended her YA writing career--and a movie franchise with it. How did her editor and publisher allow this?<br /><br />I just met Roth at a signing and told her how upset I was with this book. Her flippant reply?  &#34;Maybe you should go get some ice cream or something so you can feel better.&#34;  I completely agree that these are her characters to do with as she wishes, but as a school librarian, I won't be recommending this series to my students any longer. The thing about YA dystopian fiction is that it always leaves the readers with a sense of hope. I didn't get that here at all. Even a complete memory wipe for Tris and Tobias would have been preferable to this.<br /><br />And I haven't even touched on the humongous holes this story has, which were very ably pointed out in many other reviews here.<br /><br />All in all, I'm devastated and very, very baffled by Roth's choices. Was having Tris as a Christ figure more important than telling a good, satisfying story?
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a captivating story about generations of a family that ends tragically. Our book club had a good discussion about the drama in the book.
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|What can I say? I've waited months to be able to get this DVD. The wait is over, it came today - and my satisfaction was DASHED!! I understand that this is based on a true events, which had me lured in. Yet the production (and it was a production - a production of syrupy sweet mixed with a rare jump out of your skin ). Seemed more like a bad fiction B-rated horror flick, and about as annoying as those ghost hunter cable TV shows - a lot of nothing portrayed with dark rooms or flashing lights. I thought the best part was the late 60s or early 70s hairstyles, a flash of good music and good old cars.<br />I'm not sure I believe in all of the Warren's hokum, but I always enjoy ghosts, hauntings etc.<br />This movie starts off bad with the family dog dying and gets worse from there. There are many disjointed scenes between the Warren family and the family at the farm. I had to keep thinking, who is this now??? My husband fell asleep 10 minutes into the film. I tried very hard to keep involved in the story without missing something important and it was difficult. I just kept waiting for something really good to happen. If the exorcism could be called the \\"something good\\", well it came. It was tense because of the over the top loud screams of the possessed. It was so loud my dogs moved to another room and I wanted to turn the sound down.<br />Just so disappointing is all I can say. One more thing to add about this DVD. Why in the world when you buy a DVD must you (the buyer) be bombarded with 5 or more movie trailers?? Really media is just too out of hand.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Kids love this game.  The game is easy to play.<br />Nice animations.  Keeps them busy for hours and hours.<br />Feeding and caring for the house is easy and fun for the kids to do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great.  Not only that, but it is free!  Fun, easy to learn and fast paced.  I definitely recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You will be intrigued with how Danny grows up.  Whenever I finish reading a King novel...I have to take time to recover from the reader's high before going on to another story.  King 's style is such that your expectations have to come back to earth before you can begin to enjoy a story written by someone else.  I love the detail he puts into every character.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|The writing is clever from both intuitive and analytic points of view. Terrific read for those who happen to have their glasses on and eyes closed.
B0045DO8LA|4.0|I love Pearl Jam.  This one took some warming up to as I initially wasn't thrilled I remember, but giving it a new listen, it's pretty darn good.  It's not their best work, but it's very good.  It has 15 tracks too, so even if there were a few you didn't like, you are getting a solid 10-11 tracks like a typical release.  Not much radio play other than &#34;Love boat captain&#34;, which is a great song.  Many other great ones too.  If you are a true blue PJ fan, you will dig it.
B00BXI0IHS|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book as I have read most of Elizabeth Gilbert's but I found it disappointing. I was bored with soo much detail the first half. The second half was a little better but overall it's too try hard. A frustrating read.
B0000027RL|5.0|Loaded with classic hits.  As a debut album it is up there with Led Zeppelin I, Creeds first (and only good album) and Nirvana in my book.  A must own CD.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|This move is a truely the spagetti wester of its time. Its slow moving and full of beautiful rugged, tanned actors. Henry fonda, hot and nasty, Charles Bronson just plain hot! SHowed us how to wear a duster, which id the long suede coat those cowboys wore. Hubba Hubba.
B0000028UK|5.0|A must own for any PJ fan.  I recently listened to this again, as I've neglected it for years and I forgot just how damn good it was.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I do not pretend to be an expert in critquing books. I do go through a large volume of books a week (Normally 3-5 books).<br /><br />I was really excited to read Allegiant. I bought the first two books at the beginning of the month and read through them in no time. I had this book set to download immeadiately and was able to read it all in one day on the 22nd.<br /><br />*Spoilers ahead*<br /><br />That being said I was really disappointed in this book. The rebellion story line, first with the Allegiant group leaving the city for the \\"outside\\", then the Genetically Damaged attempting to rise against David and the GP, and lastly with Tris and the group rising against David felt repetitive. We had a rebellion in the first book, and then two in the second book. I was hoping for something new or different. Not another three rebellions that to me did not seem to expand the story lines.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed with the lack of details about the life outside of the Experiment. You don't get anything beyond the compound and a brief glimpse into the Fringe...which was really just a repeat of the Fractionless society. All the characters were one demensional. I didn't expect a full fleshed character for everyone...but I felt at least a few should have been more than they were.<br /><br />And the bad guys so far through the series have seemed one note and just like a different face of the same coin. All ruthless, power hungry, and with a dictatorship almost frame of mind.<br /><br />As for the ending...I do not feel Tris should have died. I think that what the author was trying to achieve could have been done had Tris lived and the readers had gotten a somewhat happy ending. On that note, since she did kill Tris, I feel like the ending still left a lot of questions as to what was happening and where this world was going. I didn't understand why Tobias was a politician. What was the world like now? Too many holes were left.<br /><br />I did end up returning my Kindle titleonce I finished reading it because I was angry over the story and the way it ended. I did not feel satisfied the way I normally do when I finish reading a series. I honestly felt I had more questions then answers.
0307341550|3.0|I loved Gone Girl, and so picked this book up. Gillian Flynn has a real flair for dark and twisted women characters who clearly need some counseling! Serious plot twists that I don't want to reveal, but at the end of the book, I was overwhelming sad for the main character ... so don't read looking for peaceful resolution to the story.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love Tunein Radio. I can connect to any radio station and most of all the West Indian Radio Stations. I would highly recommend Tunein to everyone.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I hope they make another one of these movies. Clever, watchable, good special effects.<br />If you like a little bit of the magical -- with fight scenes -- you'll like it.
140006922X|5.0|I have read most of the Bible but this book is a different approach and only touches on the scripts in the Bible, it opened my eyes to the life of Jesus of Nazareth, and the book also makes very good reading.
006202406X|2.0|I, like most others, had very high hopes for this finale. Unfortunately, it fell short in terms of content and tying up loose ends. There were so many directions Roth could have gone in to answer the questions brought up in the final chapters of Insurgent, yet she chose a plot that was only mildly interesting. The inner voices of the characters she used as narrators were identical and the build up to the climax (which was disappointing to say the least) was extremely sluggish. The characters themselves seemed to digress, and other than Tris and Tobias, most were one dimensional.  I found her word choice repetitive and her message of sacrifice and forgiveness to be counterintuitive to the way she ended the book. Overall, I probably would have preferred not reading it and making up my own ending.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I am liking the rewritten Star Trek universe so far. Still can't beat Ricardo Montalban for Khan though. Nuff' said, good entry
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|At times the story is cheesy, but it totally got me. with a good sense of humor author tells the life story of two youngsters, who face adult problems and have to learn how to enjoy your life even when it is too short.
B000W7JWUA|1.0|Avid Catan player but the most recent board I purchased for my parents didn't have any sheep, ore, or wood cards! The box doubled up on development cards, wheat, and brick.  Very disappointed we could not play with this game set.  Also purchased an expansion pack and the frame pieces were warped and would not connect.
B008ROG6E0|4.0|A must see for classic syfy fans.  The special effects are of course dated but the story is as timely and well done as ever.
030758836X|1.0|I couldn't finish this book - finally gave up on it around page 75. In my opinion, Flynn comes across as a real amateur; instead of being able to build a suspenseful story that is engaging, she seems distracted by listening to how her cutesy, clever words sound to herself.<br />Good story tellers are not hung up on such beginner-level \\"Look, Ma, I'm a writer!\\" such things.<br />Extremely disappointing. I will not be trying out any of her other books.
B002BWCJOA|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars if the plot of the novel had not been changed to put a boy in charge of saving the day.  Coraline's strength in Neil Gaiman's book is entirely her own, and her character in the novel is one of compassion and curiosity.  The film's protagonist is often snarky and rude, which isn't the same as being self-confident.  The portrayal of the Other Mother was spot-on -- particularly in the physical changes that render her more and more insect like.  The addition I most enjoyed in this film adaptation was the Other Father's magical garden.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter loves playing this, but the free gems option on the shopping tab does not work. It says parameters not set every time. I hope they fix this because my daughter really wants a unicorn.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Disappointed..lost 12k in chips trying to get a certain colored chip for added bonus..share and like on facebook to get bonus chips but they dont get deposited..a lot better games than this

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My computer crashed and my phone broke, so all I have is my Kindle. And I have not been able to play Candy Crush. I was jonezing. Not any more. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a spectacular game. Kids all over the world love this game. My kids enjoy playing this game because they get to help the characters run away and they get to unlock characters and disguises.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing Candy Crush, I am glad that I could download it on my Kindle Fire. Before I could only play on my PC, but<br />now I can take Candy Crush with me wherever I go. Thanks Amazon.
B00E9ZFIMM|1.0|Wow, glad I got this when it was free, because it would sooooo not be worth 99&cent;. It's functions are few, and its options nonexistent. This isn't even as good as the one that comes with Apple products, on that one you can change things like font. There are many free notebook apps for free that have many options for things like color, font style and size, and even has functions to send the page in an email. When I saw that this app was pro++ I thought it must be amazing, but not even close.
1619698196|4.0|A very good story that tied up many loose ends from previous books, including those from before this trilogy.  Recommend reading at least the first two.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, very addictive thank you Amazon for having this game app now!!!  Very competitive also, trying to pass a couple friends!!
030758836X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I got a copy from the library and read it. It has an interesting storyline and was engaging enough to get me to read the book till the end.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Just when I think I'm winning I get hit with a draw 2 or 4 card!!!! But I love the game.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|My only negative about this book has to do with the format I chose in which to read it.  I used my Kindle and would have enjoyed it more had it been an actual book.  The author had me from the beginning.  I love the unique idea of this story and found myself lost in it right away. I couldn't get through it fast enough but didn't want to finish it.  Wonderful, just wonder-full.
1465408681|5.0|My son, 6 years old, loved this book. The minifigure is a limited edition, so he liked that. It is a great present to give a Lego enthusiast, because it is much cheaper than a Lego set and it will stimulate reading. The parents will thank you for that! This book has more of a &#34;story&#34; than some of the other Lego Star Wars books. Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Finding the Chromecast helped make our decision to ditch cable.  We already have Netflix and Hulu and now we can &#34;cast&#34; anything that plays on my laptop to the TV screen.  We've had no problems at all with it, we even stream from the app on our phones.  Best thing we've done in awhile!!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|just love the cover and i'm sure it will be a hit.  i'm very happy with the quick turnaround  thank you
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great way to occupy time!  The game forces you to be patient and to think logically.  I can't wait for more rooms!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent book, provides the missing pieces to the puzzle of the historical Jesus. I have read many books on early Christianity and this book makes more sense than all of them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loving it! I have been waiting for this app for a while and happy it is finally here for the kindle fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the app so much better then even playing on Facebook. You can choose to accept your lives or not and the graphics are great and it doesn't freeze or anything. I really like it!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does not have much options of use.  I regret  that I bought it.  I would not recommend anyone to buy it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was very sad to see this series go, along with it's characters. The story was very differently written from the first two, however, I believe that the message it portrayed was great.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The game is captivating for all ages.  I love it and I am a Grandmother.  My grandkids play too.  We enjoy every new baby and am always anxious to see what we have created.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves the alphabet aquarium app!  What is truly great about this app is that it offers four different puzzles.  My daughter tends to lose interest in things quickly, but with the Alphabet Aquarium App she can choose between four different puzzle games which keeps her busy and entertained!  Her favorite puzzle is the animals puzzle, she always gets so excited when she completes a puzzle.  I love that she is having so much fun while learning at the same time!  Not only is she learning letter recognition, but I'm also seeing an improvement in her motor skills as she works to fit the pieces of the puzzles together correctly. I'm so glad I found the Alphabet Aquarium app!  I highly recommend this app to parents who are starting to work with their toddlers on letter recognition!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was pretty good but sometimes it's hard to imagine the settings and conflict. But  I have a  crush  jace
1401324649|5.0|The most hilarious, uproariously funny book I have ever read. I was howling with laughter in almost every paragraph and<br />sentence.
B00FEX1AA2|5.0|Awesome addition to feature film.  The Warren's are an inspiration to today's generation of paranormal investigation.  Ed would be proud.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I enjoy playing on the bus on my way to work and at home when I'm not busy.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|The first amazon watch I bought was a Stuhrling skeleton style watch. While It looks very nice, the pin pulls out, it didn't keep time that well and I wouldn't even think of putting it in the water. My Invicta is also beautiful, but the standard of quality seems much higher. The timer works perfectly, the crown turns very smoothly and it just looks, feels, and functions like a quality timepiece.<br />The band is very nice, on the inside. Quality leather, nice stitching, and an engraved clasp are all fine touches. The canvas covering is very curious, however. I knew what to expect by reading the reviews, and from a short distance (say 3 feet) it actually looks quite nice. The minute and hour hand are, as one reviewer said, actually a little hard to pick up because they are almost the same color. The hands do glow in the dark.<br />The huge white face is what I was after, and I was not disappointed. It is beautiful. The stainless steel is amazing. It looks awesome.<br />One thing I would look at before purchasing, though is the measurement of the THICKNESS of the watch. I expected the watch face to be big, and it is, but it is also extremely thick. Before buying, I would recommend getting out a ruler or tape measure and actually visualize the actual bulk of this thing.<br />I can't really say anything bad about this watch so far. It is exactly what I though I would be and is really unique and eye-catching.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|We were very happy to receive this movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The Croods is a great movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I loved this. It is a fun game on a rainy day. But be careful it can be addictive. But it is a really good game. You switch candies to get three in a row. Or if you get four or five you get a special surprise
B0071XO8RA|3.0|It was a little slow starting, you don't meet the hero for a few chapters, but I found myself wanting to pick the book back up frequently,to see what happens next. Good story.
B004HYDM0A|1.0|he trailers made this look SOOOOOO good!  We actually thought that this might have been a scary movie. Kind of like a cross between Blair Witch and Psycho.<br /><br />NOPE. Crappy movie about online chatting. That is 2 hours I'm not getting back.
0670813028|4.0|Is over rated...YES I said it. But I still love so many of his stories. This was an enjoyable story I just wish, like so many of Kings other books, he was cut down on a lot of the BS. If King would have cut out a lot of the pointless stories the book would have been a couple hundred pages shorter. But still.......It was a good story.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Not to shabby. I like the game play.  Not a fan of the Yoda bird though.. It is fast on the Kindle Fire HD.
1607066017|5.0|Fun, interesting and such a great imagination! The characters are awesome and I can't wait to see what happens next!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Who says soap operas were invented in the 20th century?  Lots of nudity, sex, and violence, so not for young or particular audiences.  I love historical fiction.  I found myself trying to remember &#34;what did happen to so and so in history?&#34;
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|Pros: I read the book before I saw the movie, and it follows pretty close. In fact, the movie cleared up a few things for me that were not clear when I read the book. The mansions and cars were pretty to look at. The acting was good at times.<br /><br />Cons: The CG effects were visually jarring. The graphics did  not look real and did not convey a sense of the era to me. All of the scenes with the cars driving looked fake to me, from the speed they were driving to the way they weaved in and out of traffic. I think the least realistic scenes may have been when the cars drove over the bridge.<br /><br />The director used the optometrist billboard as a backdrop for way too many scenes. In one scene it was used behind the girl getting hit by the car and because of the perspective angle it looked like she was flying fifty feet in the air. Another scene panned over the billboard across the water. Wait, wasn't the billboard next to road, or was it in front of the lake?<br /><br />The music was terrible. The party scenes were blaring hip hop to convey what was supposed to be a roaring 20's party. It was so out of character it was off-putting.<br /><br />At times I didn't think the acting was particularly good. Some of the characters didn't seem real or convincing. Based on the many poor decisions that went into making this movie, I am guessing the poor acting was because of poor direction.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag fits my camera and lenses really well.  I like the adjustable dividers inside. Great protection for my camera & lenses. Has extra pockets for books or smaller camera accessories (such as remotes, cleaner pens, etc.)
B005IQ5H7M|3.0|First of all disclaimer: I am a huge Vonnegut fan. Having said that, if you have not read any of his stuff or have and didn't like it, I would not recommend \\"Deadeye Dick\\". This is strictly for people obsessed with reading everything KV ever wrote (i.e. me). It is crazy dark and depressing, more so than his other works. If you are interested in Vonnegut, check out \\"Cat's Cradle\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" or \\"Sirens of Titan\\". Otherwise, steer clear of this one.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I saw the negative reviews and almost didn't read it but I loved the first two so thought, why not. It was a fun, lighthearted novel. Bridget hasn't changed much but you have to love her as she's trying to survive a life she didn't expect to have. It's not War and Peace but frankly, much more fun. I was surprised how sad I was when I finished, I wasn't ready to be done. So glad I read it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book had more problems than the ending.<br /><br />CONS<br />- First, the alternating point of views were confusing. Tris and Four's voices weren't differentiated enough. On more than one occasion, I mixed them up and had to re-read.<br /><br />- I spent the first two books becoming truly invested in the city and the factions. I found them to be unique and fascinating. The majority of this book is spent outside of that world, which sucked some of the magic out of the book for me.<br /><br />- Then, we leave behind the principle problems from the first two books as well:  the factions versus the factionless and the killing/hunting of the divergent. Instead, we travel to \\"the real world\\" and get involved in totally new problems and introduce brand new characters. The old characters are biting it an alarming rate.<br /><br />- They ruined Four. I don't know if it was reading his point of view versus seeing him through Tris's view, but he was no longer brave and strong. He was broken and misguided.<br /><br />- THE ENDING!!! I don't want to spoil anything, so I will simply say the ending is needlessly depressing. In some books, they end on a note like this and it feels right. This isn't one of those times. It seems like the author just wanted to avoid a clichéd happy (well relatively) ending to be edgy. This a YA lit. It wasn't realistic in the first two books, why start now? Also, the last few chapters drag in epilogue-like quality and sadness.<br /><br />PROS<br />- The relationship between Tris and Tobias feels real. They don't always agree. It isn't always magical. But they love each other, and they forgive each other their shortcomings. I believe the book says something along the lines that they choose each other every day. That's beautiful.<br />- The idea of all the serums was interesting. Especially the memory one. A creative and thought provoking alternative to physically killing someone. Is it really merciful? All you are dies, but your body lives on andyou become someone else.
B0027HOBM2|4.0|I'm starting to relate this series to LOST: the first season had a few whizbang revelations, a few shockers, a few cliffhangers, and tons of polarizing stylistic social commentary... season two builds upon that, but rather than forcing these aspects down your throat, we are now following Don and crew along their merry little path. The shockers (are they supposed to be shockers?) don't have the same impact as in the first season; in fact, as the finale drew to a close, I simply acknowledged it and moved on to buying season three.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: it's a quality show, and very engaging. The writing and the characters are slick -- in fact, I'm sure a portion of the *lack* of shock is that I am getting such a feel for the characters that 'what happens next' feels very organic, rather than forced-for-shock-value.<br /><br />On another note: one of the things I like best from the first season to second, is that some of the sexism has mellowed out a bit. I'm not saying that I want to close my eyes to how bad it may or may not have been... but from an entertainment perspective, I started hating EVERYBODY because they're just all bad people. Season two brings it down to a level where I can like/dislike people without having my face ground into it, and I'm curious to see what happens next!<br /><br />O, and be sure to peruse the extras! They're not earth-shattering, but they're interesting. They are imminently shareable if one person can watch the video while the other is busy.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS DVD  FOR MY DAD AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND HE LIKES IT ALOT  AND SO DO I ONE GREAT MOVIE
B002ZG981E|5.0|The *thinking* part of me overthought things, but that doesn't denigrate this film. Is it in my top-5? Nope. But it's still a very good, entertaining flick; I'll definitely re-watch it, and have watched many of the featurettes. This is the sort of movie MADE for commentary and making-of material!<br /><br />My suggestion to you: watch it with an alert eye, but try to tone down your &#34;I'm going to figure it out before the end!&#34; attitude, or else it'll ruin the beauty of the film-making.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Super Awesome movie. DVD Blu-Ray combo is Great. No issues all three formats work and play great. I highly recommend to all.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Aside from being *just* a sci-fi flick, this film covers a range of the human [HEEHEE!] condition: prejudices, character motivation, moral compass, dedication... but it is not subtle about such things. At time, it actually bludgeons you so hard that when you catch yourself wondering &#34;How can people be so insensitive and downright cruel to these CG aliens!&#34; you also scowl at how quickly you relate it to issues of racism and poverty throughout our own history -- and present.<br /><br />In terms of watchability, there isn't much that will shock you about this film, although it is not quite as formulaic as you may expect. The effects are at times passable, and at other times VERY good. My disbelief was never fully suspended, but it doesn't take you too far out of the story.<br /><br />Buy this movie. Make sure you won't be interrupted. The nuance won't be subtle, but there's definitely more at stake here than a popcorn flick.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. If you want to understand more about great recording! Guide lines tell me I need more words but they are unneeded
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this book as I have previous Grisham books and there were some twists to the plot that  I didn't anticipate.  I would recommend it to other readers.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|THE BLACK EAGLE INN BY CHRISTOPH FISCHER<br /><br />After reading and thoroughly enjoying the two earlier books in this Three Nations Trilogy (The Luck of the Weissensteiners and Sebastian) I was expecting to be enthralled yet again and I wasn't disappointed!<br /><br />This book kept me captivated right to the very last page.  I was drawn in so cleverly and couldn't wait to turn the pages.  This is a family saga with a difference.  It revolves around the restaurant - the Black Eagle Inn and a farm owned by the Hinterberger family and set in Bavaria. There is Anna and her brother Hans-Ulrich who are from a large family.  With the Great War and all the problems that brought, the younger children were mostly left to the care of older brothers.  However, Anna soon proved to be a natural leader and took charge herself.  Although Anna was ten years older than Hans-Ulrich, the pair developed a special bond which was to last for many years.  We learn how the siblings deal with the many happenings of that time.  Anna wasn't blessed with children so took a special interest in her nieces and nephews.<br /><br />There is Maria, one of Hans-Ulrich's daughters, whose life takes a surprising turn.  Then we have Lukas, Maria's brother, and Marcus, their cousin and how the rivalry between the two develops.<br /><br />There is so much more I could say but you need to read this marvellous book yourself to find out what happens.<br /><br />This story takes us through all the turbulent years during and after the second world war.  How a rural family, and indeed much of Germany, coped with the many changes.  Christoph Fischer brings to life, through his colourful characters, history in such a way that the reader has a better understanding of those times.<br /><br />Another excellent book from the pen of Christoph Fischer that really must be read.<br />Fully deserving of five stars (I would give it six if possible!).
B0037TPMOA|5.0|I watched the film years ago, when I was young enough to be scared by it. The book had a creeping psychological effect and was quite chilling, in a very different way to the film. It's an interesting concept that hotels have a history. If that hotel is around long enough, tragedy and dastardly deeds are bound to come-a-knocking, right? And what if those events left their mark? A karmic stain, just the right circumstances for evil to flourish. A modern classic that I really enjoyed reading.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Anyone who doesn't understand this movie should probably go watch Madea Goes to Jail or some simple movie that requires little to no thought process. It takes an open mind to watch a movie by Nicolas Winding Refn. Don't expect anything to be directly handed to you in this movie. And if you're looking for something with dozens of overly dramatic and overly exaggerated car wrecks (like in Fast and the Furious), this movie isn't for you.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|very fun and addicting however the only playing so many times then you are out of lives is retarded. only annoyed because I cant put it down but I have to lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Especially since its now on Kindle!!!! No more having to go online to a computer. Thanks Amazon!!!!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Love this game. most achievements easy to get. add me CJSYKXN. if you need neighbors! I play multiple times daily.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absolutely love it, it's fun to come back to and hope that I got the Dragon I wanted, I love how it makes it hard so not everyone has the same dragons. I also love how I'm not forced to buy the crystals.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome! It is a better than just playing on facebook on the pc! Your lives don't get taken just for signing on, so you actually get to use all the hearts you are given! I recommend this game to everyone!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|this is one of mine and my husbands favorite tv shows , we can't wait to see seasons 5 and 6
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again, Stephen King does not disappoint.  If you love horror stories and \\"The Shining\\" you will enjoy this book.  I have been reading Stephen King since forever and I have never been let down.  A good book is one that wraps a warm blanket around you and suddenly an immersion into a new world takes place.  In \\"Doctor Sleep\\", as in the majority of King' s books, you know you are in for one hell of a ride and you better have your seat belt buckled tight.  The reader will learn things about Danny that we never thought would happen and how a 13 year old girl with the shine becomes entangled into the madness, along with other unforgettable characters.<br /><br />I fell in love and hate again with the characters from \\"The Shining\\":  Danny, Jack, Mr. Halloran, etc.  Without divulging too much, there are some old, scary people making appearances and of course some new sick and twisted monsters introduced, just so I can add them to the creepy things nightmares are made off.<br /><br />Also, family secrets become entwined and discovered.  This one would be a great movie!  Thanks to Stephen King for making my mind conjure images I would rather not ever run into and sleepless nights wondering what else is lurking in the shadows that only he could create.  So get a warm blanket, cuddle up with a cup of hot cocoa, tea, or coffee and enter a different world...one where RVs become haunted houses of the highways.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|It was really very cute - my 6 & 7 year old boys have watched it 3 times already, they give it 5 stars, who could ask for more?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If love this game. So fun to play!! It is fun for all ages. One thing it drains the crap out of my battery.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|this game is frustrating. been working on the same two pics for a week. not enough guidence. Jam not even sure what the heck a tailsman is.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It's pretty simple, but there will be levels that will make you question your sanity. A couple levels I've run into make you drop ingredients to the bottom (acorns &amp; cherries). Problem is the game will not give you the items until you're either low on moves or have zero chance of getting the right candy colours to make the drops happen. Or as has happened numerous times to me already, all the ingredients don't drop so there is no possible way to pass the level. And if that's not bad enough you can get boosts to help, you just have to pay for them. Another issue I have is you only get 5 chances to pass levels at a time. Run out of chances and you can beg your Facebook friends to donate more to you OR pay for more, unless you wait for them to recharge. Not 100% positive how long it takes to get all 5 lives restored but seems to be about 2 hours. You can't even go back to the levels you passed if you run out of &quot;lives&quot;. The game is fun but the frustration will set in rather quick if you're not patient and don't want to waste money on the boosts or lives you'll run out of rather quickly. ENJOY
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love that I can watch this on Prime! Super easy, super good quality, no lagging. Better than Netflix on this count.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|The movie was good, exactly what I expected. Would have gotten 5 stars if it came with Part 2 for the same price!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Enjoy playing this game and watching tv . A game that really makes you think. It can also challenge you by beating the clock or your last time
B007A4SDCG|4.0|This is an excellent and short read.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the author rambled unnecessarily on some pages.  Other than that, I highly recommend it.
B00F9040HU|3.0|it took a lot of time to go to different settings I  liked the other Atlantis games more  they were more better staged for playing
B0084IG8TM|4.0|In anticipation for Catching Fire coming out next month me and my girls watched The Hunger Games. I have not read the books but I can say that this movie was an interesting action movie. I'm not a fan of violent films but my girls have read the books so I decided to watch the movie with them. I like the moral dilemma that Katniss faces in the story, she protects her sister, she refuses to kill the boy from her community and learns to survive. As young as Jennifer Lawrence is here I believe that she is going to have a great career ahead of her. This movie is not for younger children but my teenaged daughters loved it. If you want an entertaining movie that will immerse you into this well developed world I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />- Charlotte Oliver Clearwater FL<br />Twitter: @CharBOliver

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Please add the other levels asap. It sucks to only be able to play levels above 440 on a computer!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Harry Bosh aka Michael Connelly. The stories are always filled with deductions that make sense and I love travelling through the streets of LA
B005LAIIGW|1.0|I'm a SF fan, but... The trailer said there was no sound in space, then I had to suffer through Sandra Buttock whining, yelling, and squealing as her chubby facelifted corpse flops around the void like a bludgeoned cod? That's false advertising. And then Clooney dies and leaves me alone with the big Buttock? Not me. I'll take death in space.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|If you want action this is the movie for you. I would watch it again, no doubt about it!! Thanks
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|GREAT SERVICE to offer. WE NEEDED Walking Dead.  OUR local cable does not carry AMC which we've watched for 3 previous seasons.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|We bought this for our mom! She likes PHILLIP PHILLIPS  very much, ever since AMERICAN IDOL days and so far no complaints! She enjoys the entire disc!
006202406X|3.0|I loved thr first two books and couldn't put them down (both times I read them).  Sadly this one took me longer to get though and was definitely flawed.  I hated the ending as most people did.  In addition switching between tris and tobias was okay but he should have had a differnt voice.  This book was more explanations than action.  I would never read this one again.  I also don't see this as a movie if they try to make the entire series into one.
0307588343|4.0|You'll be carrying this book around with you for the week that it will take you to read.  A griping whodunit it's a teller of bitter truths that we all need to learn in order to avoid another financial collapse.  And perhaps someday we will have learned how to clawback some of the ill-gotten gain that many of these crooked financial investors took out of our banking and investment systems.  Very well written.
0345528581|4.0|I waited till I finished one of the 10 week programs in the book before I did this review. Now that I'm finished I can say this is an excellent book. I originally borrowed the book from the library and liked it so much I bought it. I've worked out off and on throughout the years and have been in and out of gyms. I always wanted to prove to myself that I could get in shape at home and I didn't really need a gym. I stumbled across this book and it is great. I took away one star for  few reasons. I think the nutrition section could be a little more in depth. Diet is a really important part of seeing results which is my weak point. Would've liked to see recipes or more examples of food to eat, etc. Also, certain ways to do sets and exercises could be clearer. Luckily, you can go to his website and get more information on some of the stuff that's unclear. But overall, I love this book and it has changed the way I view fitness.<br /><br />P.S. How could I forget the PRICE? The amount of info you get in this book compared to comparable books/programs (P90X/Insanity) etc. is PHENOMINAL. You can tell the author is really not doing this just to make money, he really wants to help people get healthy. Also, his DVDs are priced well below the popular programs out there. I can't recommend this book enough.
1594202273|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. There is a nonfiction Clancy-esque techno thriller woven between the historical details of command and control of nuclear weapons. These devices aren't like rounds of ammunition that can just sit on the shelf for years at a time; they need constant careful maintenance and even that is fraught with near catastrophes. My biggest takeaway is these weapons and delivery systems are incredibly complex. So complex that I am concerned about potential/likely problems as these weapons proliferate to nations with less capability to safely manage these systems.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I love this book!  What a smart, intuitive, retrospect on success. The author shares his method and approach to personal and business success as an entrepreneur in a simple, straightforward, one hour read. If you are struggling with your own business, or thinking about starting one, invest an hour and set free your own imagination for.... \\"Anything You Want\\"!

B00EP0SIOG|5.0|...or at least I had never heard or it.  Here's how it goes:<br />You get this product (Sphero) which looks and feels a bit like an oversize pool ball.  Then you download 1 or more of Orbotix's apps onto your iOS or Android phone.  Your phone then uses Bluetooth to send commands to the ball.  It has gyro positioning so even as it is spinning, it keeps track of which direction would correlate to each of up/down/left/right on your phone's virtual joystick and so you use that to control where the ball goes.  This does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you can fairly accurately drive it around the house.  It has mild impact resistance, so it will tolerate the inevitable crash into walls, the occasional fall off of a short (< 18\\") surface, and a small amount of abuse from the toddler or cat you may have in your house that will certainly want to grab it.<br /><br />Besides just rolling it around, you can also change the color with a high level of precision (although my 5 year old was a little distressed that the red was not quite as saturated as she would have liked--it looked a little on the pink side).  But what is even cooler, is you can download other apps from Orbotix that let you play games ranging from augmented reality zombie wars to drawing something and having the Sphero then \\"draw\\" that picture (by rolling around and turning the colors you specify) on the floor.  Note that the augmented reality game is fun, but VERY hard until you really get the hang of operating this thing.<br /><br />My 5 year old thought it was fun, but got a bit frustrated with it after a while because it IS hard to control.  My mother-in-law thought it was a hoot and even my wife (who isn't normally in to this sort of thing) enjoyed a brief test drive.  Oh, and my 1 year old chased it around for the entire time anyone was playing with it and had a blast.<br /><br />This is a very fun toy.  A little on the pricey side, and it DOES require you to have a phone and download to it in order to work, but I think there are many groups of people who could get a real kick out it.  I'd say this would be best for ages 8-18, but our test included ages 1 to \\"grandma\\" and was well received by all.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|This was a fairly predictable plot... boy meets \\"unusual\\" new girl at school and befriends her despite the fact that she is shunned by the other kids. He ends up braving occult dangers for her affection as expected, but the acting wasn't bad and it was entertaining enough to keep me watching.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like the game a lot. Just getting started and have a good deal of work to catch up with my friends.
B0084ANCBC|3.0|I liked the plot very much.  However, there were a lot of words given to people, places, and events that have nothing to do with the plot itself.  I'm sure they were meant to critique the characters, but as I know nothing about that time period in England it was lost on me.  Those lengthy passages made it hard for me to get through the book.
B00F4PM6WG|4.0|Bought this for my great grandkids to play while they wait.<br />It was easy for them to use, and they loved it!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Based on a true story(although a little has been added) this is a really good movie. Plenty of action and great characters.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Not knowing anything about how to play the game in the first place, made it difficult to use.<br />Don't enjoy playing when the instructions aren't clear.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|The best Robin Hood I have ever seen. Plenty of the great oldtime action and humor. Errol Flyn was one of the greats.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|I heard this was recalled and I'm awaiting information for the replacement or a credit for the product.  Please advise
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is a fantasy for adults, mainly because the vocabulary will leave them out of the best laughs.  All of the actors do a great job, and if you want a big dose of silliness, I can't think of a better movie.  I'd put this somewhere in my top ten.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Once you start watching FRINGE you can't stop. Totaly Addictive program enjoyed by all with an open and explorative mind.

B002QVZ71I|5.0|Awesome!  Great movie and even greater sound track.  Hard to believe how old this movie is, and yet still so timeless!!!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|bought it for grandkids for when they come over<br />they love watching movies I can sit with them an<br />relax
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, it challenges you to be creative! Once you start playing you won't be able to stop. A must have on every devise.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was the first Crouch novel I've read.  It had me after the first few pages. Highly recommended and Highly entertaining!
B003HV0TN2|2.0|To be honest, I'm a big fan of giving books a chance. But over the years I've become much less forgiving - as there are so many amazing books out there that really do deserve my attention...and unfortunately this is not one of them.<br /><br />My rule is that if a book completely fails to draw me in and/or make me give a damn about the story and characters within the first chapter, then that book is not worth reading.<br /><br />After reading the description and blurb of this particular book, I had a nagging feeling that I might just be in for some more-of-the-same vapid and generic fantasy writing - complete with the cringe-inducing conventions of style, prose, setting and structure that the fantasy genre is notorious for.<br /><br />After reading my way to the end of the first chapter, I believe my suspicions have been confirmed, and I'll be returning the book.<br /><br />Fantasy as a genre is kind of like the whole zombie-apocalypse thing as a genre - it's been so done to death in its standard forms, that unless you are an exceptionally gifted writer and come up with a compellingly original and refreshing new take on it, it just isn't going to elicit anything more than a groan and the sound of a book closing...at least not from anybody that isn't already hopelessly enamored of the genre in question. Even the more original ideas on this continuum are often poorly executed.<br /><br />Overall, if you're on the fence I'd say give this one a miss.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was has a good plot and good writing. I'm often annoyed by many books these days that have terrible grammar but that isn't the case with this one. The characters are all interesting and one can identify with most of the characters. I loved how the book builds connections between the various chacracters as the book progresses. I initially thought this was a &#34;chick flick&#34; book but I'd go watch a movie based on this book if one was made.
159463176X|1.0|I loved his previous books, they were the BEST.<br />This one,  I felted that it was a waste of my time, started good but it went on too many stories.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I like that the mobile app saves the lives given to you until you need them, unlike Facebook.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While I wish there was more detail given to scenes and environments, it is a great story. With stories on the news about drone strikes and government unrest I think this story, without knowing everything that happens before it is quite believable. I found myself caring for the characters, and that to me is what makes a story great.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a great book. I like stories that change perspectives throughout the book. I thought this book was SUSPENSEFUL and full of twists and turns. I recommend it to all!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice good game for enjoyment. Recommended for game lovers. Nice scenery and good theme :) a four stars plus. Xxx xxx xxx
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|this great is great except for the wait time...wish the core would be faster to load...but other then that cool game
B003G4W49C|5.0|My 11 year old enjoyed it as well.  It was a good push for him to understand and comprehend the material.  I loved reading it alongside him.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is one of the best things that I have ever downloaded. The mixture of different sounds that you can create really helps me to relax and fall asleep much quicker. I wish I would have found this earlier but glad I have it now. Amazed!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Love this movie! It is an absolute classic. Tom Hanks is hysterical and it always makes me so happy when I watch it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love it!! By far the best basic calculator I've come across. Used it to replace the stock app on my Ultra.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Buy it you will be awesome at the end!  Not a fast pace reading more than a slow motion situation but thrilling!
0679731725|5.0|Dignity, service and honor are the ideals James Stevens, a butler, has lived by in serving his employer Lord Darlington at Darlington Hall for over 30 years.  As Stevens reviews his life, he remembers a young and spirited housekeeper, Miss Kenton, of whom he was fond.  Although she is married now, he decides to visit her as an old friend.  What the reader realizes while reading this book is that Stevens is a finer man than the man he served who was a Fascist sympathizer.  We also realize that he has repressed his emotions, and liking for Miss Kenton, now Mrs. Benn, and is experiencing tinges of regret.  What is ironic is that we are more aware of what he has missed out on, and probably realize his loss more keenly, than he allows himself to acknowledge.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary and unusual book. Not too many books are written about the personal lives of the servant class, or their lack of a personal life.  This novel - which won the Booker Award for fiction - shines the light on one man's fate when he put service to his master, as many servants had to do, before his personal happiness.  The movie with Anthony Hopkins as Stevens and Emma Thompson as Miss Kenton brings this novel to life.  Both novel and film are worthy of your time if you like subtle and deep retrospection.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Mainly a good story but the ending seemed rushed, it was almost as if he had an editors deadline to submit the story.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great app, easy to lose time with it.  It would be nice to have a Little bit of variety to sizes of the puzzles.
B000V4NX04|5.0|The issue isn't socialism or democracy; it is totalitarianism --  whether of the right or the left -- or freedom.  The basic unit of society is the human individual created, in the meaningful words of the Roman Catholic catechism, in the image and likeness of God (Aquinas).  As such, each of is an end in his/her self.<br /><br />This film shows what happens to human beings when forced to live in a totalitarian society.  One is forced to conform just to survive; and, if you have a family, to conform openly -- even feign enthusiasm for the system -- to protect them. In a totalitarian society all are treated as instruments of the state, as though owned by the maximum leader and his privileged oligarchy.  It is terrorism of the worst sort.  Of course, Milovan Djilas, the Yugoslav, had already said it all.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|If you're not completely hooked by the end of this season, just give up and don't buy any more.  However, most will be completely hooked after the first episode!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really addicting. I am not to much of a gamer but I have found this game to be extremely fun and tolerable, I love. The colors and the little fish at the end of the game that take your score to another level.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Really enjoyed the continued story line. Like many Stphen King Novels-it makes you wonder...can this REALLY be possible?  Who knows?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Beyond 5 stars!!!  I really enjoyed the novel.  I have not had such an achingly, heartwrenching, grab your heart and make you read til the end novel in quite a while.  Now I want more!!!  But seriously, the scary people in here vs the good people gives you something to think about.<br />Thank You so very much Mr. King for bringing the Boys story up to date from the shining...  I do actually have to admit to wondering what he's been up to lately.....  Now, I'm gonna be wondering about the young lady!!!!
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Go ahead, try to watch this season without becoming attached to the characters. You'll get Litt Up, and understand why everyone was tweeting #saveDonna
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game i play it all the time. The game is always different every run. It keeps you on your toes.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|A fun movie that has a &#34;Feel Good&#34; ending!  We watched the movie a second time and saw more fun details than the first time due to the fast paced action scenes. The Extras are very cool (we watched it the 3rd time in a version where the Minions interact with the actual movie, like a movie within the movie, surprisingly well done!).  Very entertaining!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A good book. Doesn't have the excitement of his early novels, but few do. There were too many loose ends that had to be explained.  I don't like how he makes the criminals and drug dealers as regular guys while making law enforcement officers and government unsympathetic.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Working through this series and properly addicted. I do feel that some parts stretch on more than they should and leave me a bit bored, and it would be nice if the endings to each book in the series offered a bit more of a wrap-up, but the complexity of this world is impressive and I've grown quite attached to some of the characters. Can't wait to read the next one!
1932907009|5.0|My first scenario finished, I was happy but it felt like something was missing, the story was too linear and dull, without clear directions.<br /><br />My friend Hubert recommended me this book, I was reluctant but I did read it.<br />This is the best thing I did for my writing carreer.<br /><br />Now my scenario is way richer, with turns and twists I couldn't implement on my own (I never went to school to learn how to write movies, maybe that's why but now I dont't have to, lol)<br /><br />It's a MUST for anyone who wants to write for hollywood. It reveals THE formula for mainstream movies.<br />The sad news is that it uses always the same patterns which is why hollywood movies all look the same.<br />Blake Snyder says it bluntly : &#34;Give me the same but different&#34;.<br /><br />Readers may feel that using rules described in this book would play against their creativity, I agree.<br />So depending on the kind of movie you want to write (mainstream, artsy, avant-garde, documentary...), you may use all or parts of those rules.<br /><br />Even the author admits it but made an interesting point :<br />To reach true creativity, you have to know and master what you want to break away from.<br />And sell your scripts on the way...<br /><br />Touché !
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm an author looking to read bestsellers as a tool for better learning what works, and it's books like these that intimidate you while at the same time exciting you about what's possible. What a brilliant writer - what a brilliant tale!
B004KBSQBA|4.0|Always like the harmony of the African singers and didn't mind Paul Simon adding his two cents to each song.<br />Paul used them, and the African singers used Paul to create some great music.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I usually love reading this type of thing, but I think it was a stretch and a bit hypocritical to refer to his own subjective experiences as &#34;proof&#34; after not taking other people on their word about near-death experiences. Of course, changing our mind about something is a good thing and we should all be open-minded, but we can't then turn around and present stories of our personal experiences as &#34;evidence&#34; and expect non-believers to listen. It doesn't work that way.<br /><br />Otherwise, still a very interesting story.
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|The actual gameplay is rather fun. There's two problems that Mar an otherwise 4-5 star game. 1.) The game crashes FREQUENTLY. You can fire the app back up, but I've had it crash frustratingly frequently, often only giving me a few minutes before it forces a reboot. 2.) Money. This game is technically free, but the frequency with which it hits you up for money is pretty absurd. Half of the in-game items cost real money; maxing out the game's resources could easily cost hundreds a nickel or dime at a time. It's the creator's prerogative and imperative to make money off of their product, but they go excruciatingly overboard.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! The writing style was easy to follow and it kept me interested from start to finish. Even if you don't enjoy &#34;mysteries&#34; this book will keep you guessing and at some points nail biting. Looking forward to reading more from Flynn!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little tool for putting a super sharp blade on your knife, fillet knife, machete, etc...  and the round file for serrated blades works great.  Highly recommend.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was absolutely phenomenal, and it was so different from the others (in a good way) that I wasn't sure I was reading the right book!!! There were plot twists left and right, and the combo of it all just hurt my heart.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|I think the game is great builds off the comic series. I've been playing with the touch controls which are responsive. I do notice that there are some game stutters when it transitions into cut scenes. Not sure if it's the game or the system. It's nothing that ruins the experience but you will notice it.<br />I haven't finished it yet. what I have played is enjoyable. I highly recommend getting The Walking Dead. I've played some on PC and PS3. I think this version pulls me into the story more. Being able to take it anywhere is a huge plus.<br />Graphic was it's a really good comparison to the console versions. There are some lowered graphics but overall it looks great.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I'll start by saying I loved Divergent and Insurgent.  Loved them, but this book was terrible.  I'm not even referring to the ending, which was pretty lame and disappointing.  The book itself was not well written.  It was boring, contrived and full of plot holes.  About halfway through reading it, I felt an overwhelming urge to Google \\"does anyone else think Allegiant plot stupid\\".  Guess what!  I'm clearly not alone.  I'm embarrassed that I ever encouraged anyone to read these books.  Now I have no desire to even see the movie, and I'll be shocked if Insurgent and Allegiant ever get made into movies after this disaster of a book.<br /><br />Ms. Roth's decision to have Tris die like some sort of Jesus figure was ham-handed at best, extremely stupid at worst.  Ugh.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I finished the book the day it came out and as most people I was a tad devastated at the ending. Had I written a review then it probably would have been much angrier and bitter but after processing the book I think I understand why she did what she did, even if I don't like it. That being said, I do agree with other posts that the voices between the two was a tad difficult to capture at time. I did have to double back a couple of times because i forgot who was &#34;talking&#34; but I think the further I got along the less of a problem it became. I loved many parts of the book but there were a few instances where it just felt off, I'm not sure how to describe but it just felt different than the first two, especially at the beginning. Overall I think the book is very good, I didn't love it like I loved the previous two book but I think now I would probably go back and reread it at a slower pace to really get into it and not rush through maybe it'll feel different. I do think that the constant bashing (and 1 star review) only over the ending is a bit rough, we can't decide how Veronica Roth should write a book only she can, and this was the story she had for the characters.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Speedy service.  With this one he had it put together in no time.  Great product<br />for young minds. Will order more in the future. Thanks
B007FEZQF8|3.0|A bit cheesy and ham handed in its storytelling, but overall, fairly compelling despite its flaws. Solid beginning to what is sure to be a good series.
B0000041DF|5.0|A masterpiece performed by one of the greatest, and perhaps the most passionate pianist of out time. The only &#34;criticism&#34; I have read about Martha's rendering of this piece is that she has too much verve and passion, and its hard for the poor orchestra to keep up with her. Fortunately, in this recording, Chailly et al do a remarkable job of so doing. Don't play this recording while driving because your heart will race and you may end up with an expensive speeding ticket.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|It's a hit! i can play this on repeat for hours. That's probably a bad idea though. Excited for the album!
B0048WQDIE|3.0|After three attempts I finally made it through this book. Lot's of people I know have raved about this book, so I put it on my must read list. I labored through the first 45 pages, after which the book got less annoying. Everyone told me that this book was hilarious, and I can see why they might say that, but I was not bowled over by Heller's hyper-ironic sense of humor. It felt overdone to me. I get the central message of the ridiculousness of modern warfare and how one either has to be crazy to participate in war or will be driven crazy in the process of war. Yeah, I get it. But I felt like I was being bludgeoned over the head with this insight. Overall, I didn't hate the book in the end as much as I did at the start, but I am also not compelled to reread it (my measure of whether a book is good or not). I think most people will find this book entertaining, so I won't go lower than 3 stars, but I can't fully endorse it either, so I won't go higher than 3 stars.
B00E9ZFIMM|5.0|I was expecting a poor app but it seems well adapted for the kindle fire HD. Problems found by other have been fixed and it is really easy to take notes and access them. I have only downloaded it today but I will certainly keep it and use it to.make notes. My wife will be happy when I remember all the shopping list in future. Also the date format suits me. I cannot get used to the US way of putting months first. If the developer makes it too complex I think it may spoil the ease of using it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really wanted a happily ever after, I can't believe after everything we have gone through with these characters there was no happy ending. It was all good until the last few chapters, then I just wanted some of the memory serum mentioned in the book so I could just undo what I had just read..<br />I guess it's real, life doesn't always give you a happy ever after.<br />Might change my mind about the number of stars later, right now I'm still upset about the end.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is way better than the other hunting program by glu. Longer hunting time and more money to get stuff with.

1611762022|2.0|My connection with Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style and point of view in \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" made me want to love this novel as well. I did not. Loving Elizabeth Gilbert as I do, I am so glad that the book is doing well and that others seem to enjoy it. I didn't find it interesting or compelling. Parts of the book were brilliant. The research was obviously stellar and at times, seemed to be too much of the focus of the book. The story and characters, to me, never seemed as well presented and developed as the descriptions of how moss grows. Yikes.  The beginning of the book was promising.  When Retta appeared on the scene with her nonsensical speech and unconventional ways I thought \\"Ok, now we are getting somewhere\\". I thought the juxtaposition between Retta's lifestyle of extreme freedom and Prudence's almost desperate need to demonstrate perfect restraint, would create an interesting conflict for the reasonable, yet frustrated Alma. Instead (spoiler alert) Retta got thrown into an institution where nothing interesting ever happened again to the most interesting character of the book. Why was her character created and developed only to be tossed into an institution and forgotten. I felt betrayed.  Again with the character of Prudence. She is developed and then, largely forgotten. Alma is not a particularly interesting character and has nothing particularly interesting to do. If you are going to make your protagonist a frumpy, middle aged botanist from the 1800's then they better DO something interesting, and fast. This, unfortunately happens toward the end and is way too little, way too late.

0307352153|5.0|If you are introvert, prepare to feel comforted and understood, finally!  If you are an extrovert, you are treated kindly in this book regardless, and will hopefully have more respect and kindness for your introvert acquaintances.  This book is landmark.  Thank you so much, Susan Cain.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This product came exactly on time which is always a great thing.<br /><br />I ordered the coral coloured sleeve, and it matches the shade in the picture perfectly. This sleeve has a slight lining inside which protects the kindle in case of any fall. It is also easy to carry with its little belt outside. The material is great and is well constructed. All in all the cover is its money s worth.
006202406X|1.0|I can not express how upset I am with the ending of Allegiant. I can not believe the author would do this to her readers. I cried the last seven chapters of the story. Most author's have the common sense not to kill off one of the main characters...who does that! It is malicious, mean and unfair to the readers. I hope she learns from this mistake with all the bad reviews she is getting. I will not be going to watch the movie Divergent and I will not read anything else by Veronica Roth. If you really get emotionally invested in your books like I do, I advise you skip Allegiant and make up you own ending.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book. A great story, I loved how all the characters came together and the what ifs at the end.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|they were not kidding when they said its additive.<br />started playing &amp;only stopped when all my life was gone.<br />liked that each stage. is a little different.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fund game and when riding, doctor office and very good when you are just playing on you spare time, I just love this game.
B0084FMBDM|5.0|I bought them really not knowing how comfy they would be or how they'd fit, but I'm very please with them. I'm really not a sandal kind of guy but these are excellent.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This movie is pretty incredible. Scripted by Jonathon Nolan with some input by director Christopher Nolan, this story centers around the conflict Batman faces with Heath Ledger's Joker. Incredible special effects and acting, this movie can easily entertain those who don't know much of the Batman mythos; the plot is very interesting, and its details barely hinge upon the first movie, \\"Batman Begins,\\" so anyone can still be drawn into the epic story. Five stars. Definitely should add it to you movie collection if you don't own it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I just loved this movie. I just heard the song a few months ago and then when i came across it here i decided to buy the movie... Great buy
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This film was fantastic. It is mainly a look at how Batman would end his career. Really well done, both in film and on the story. No director or writer has EVER attempted to write an actual END to Batman's story. Definitely worth the buy, if you enjoyed the first two films.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|This movie is really very good. I had started watching it when i was in chicago but got to my hotel and had to leave... I recommend this movie.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've tried a lot of apps to learn French. This one is fun and simple. There are no in app purchase catches. It has a few different styles of questions and though maybe a bit repetitive sometimes it really does teach you.<br />My favorite part is if you do not check in constantly you lose part of your progress. Encouraging you to keep up on your skills.<br />I take it back my most favorite part is the it's free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a challenge. I don't like how long it takes to get coins. I would like to see the update.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|This is an unexciting and mundane version of a classic Austin story, mainly b/c the female star Romola Garai is not up to a nuanced  performance. She is all elbows, clumpy movements, and constant, irritating grins.  She has none of the sweet, saucy, headlong persona of Austin's Emma, and is rather clownish in her behavior, appearing more determined than intelligent.  Johnny Lee Miller does a better job as the love interest but he, too, lacks the sophistication the role demands.  Back to the delightful Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam jewel for me.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addicted to CCS and so happy to see I can now access on my Kindle!  Got  my husband hooked now to &quot;that stupid game&quot; ;-)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I was so excited to see a commercial on television advertising the book, which I had already downloaded. It is billed as not being a sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; but there are enough connections to make it a page turner.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Short review because I honestly have no words to describe.... this book is a beautiful closing to the series... I loved it.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I bought this backpack a little over a month ago.  I only used the backpack a few times and the handle on top of the backpack has already broken.  I am currently in the process of seeing what I can do to fix it.  Overall, the backpack has a lot of storage for how small the backpack is.  I love the size and storage, but was upset that the handle has already broke.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome majority of family and friends play wish it was more then 5 turns. I play Papa Pear ,Pet Rescue and Farm also.

B009RH973I|2.0|I bought this case with my kinlde fire hd. After a while the strap caused the front of the case (the lining ) to tear, i can see the glue marks and its falling apart. On the bright side its perfect for watching videos, browsing etc. But not as durable
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I thought that Veronica Roth did a great job in completing the trilogy. I finished the book very quickly, and found it to be as entertaining as the first two books. I found allegiant to be even more thought provoking than the previous two books.<br /><br />Keep in mind, however, that this is a dystopian series. If you're rooting for a HEA it may be quite different than you envisioned.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I have purchased multiple hunting games and out of all of them this is the best one yet. It's a great game with amazing graphics. I've been told this game doesn't install on the Kindle but it does. I love it! There are all sorts of different types of animals to hunt. Including deer, wolves, bears, cheetahs, elephants, zebras, and much more. Plus it's free, again, best hunting game ever!
1250007208|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book, and can’t wait to read the rest of the books in The Lunar Chronicles. As a fan of Firefly, Joss Whedon’s outstanding sci-fi series, as well as fresh renditions of Grimm’s fairy tales, I adored this futuristic retelling of Cinderella with its East-meets-West fusion. The world Meyer has created is rich and enchanting, and not just in the beautiful descriptions of New Beijing and cyborg technology. There is so much more to this story than a reboot of the old tale about a mistreated girl who meets a handsome prince.<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg, and as such, is a second-class citizen who doesn’t even have the right to decide what happens to her own body. She is a slave, forced to work as a mechanic to support a cruel and lazy step-mother who spends Cinder’s hard-earned money on lavish ball gowns for her own daughters. Cinder’s only friends are one of her step-sisters and an android. She faces daily discrimination from shop owners in the market where she works, and at any time, could be drafted for medical experimentation. A deadly plague has claimed thousands of lives, including those of the cyborgs being used against their will to find a cure.<br /><br />But Cinder’s not waiting for anyone to save her. She plans to use her mechanical skills to find a way to leave the city, to create a new life where she doesn’t have to hide her metal foot. When she meets Prince Kai, Cinder is drawn into a political conflict involving the vicious Lunar queen, a ruthless woman who hopes to merge her kingdom with the prince’s through marriage. Although attracted to the prince, Cinder refuses his advances. She knows a relationship with him is forbidden, and fears that if he knew who she really was, he would reject her.<br /><br />In the end, she has to make a choice between duty to her planet and freedom for herself. I loved her strength of character—she knows who she is, and refuses to apologize for that, recognizing that thebias against her is not her fault, even though she must sometimes hide her true identity. In a society where being a cyborg makes her less than human, Cinder embraces both what makes her human and what makes her cyborg, and in doing so, finds that she is greater than the sum of her parts.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Great series - love the cast - not a laughable series like cheers or Seinfeld but it's not the same genre
1457514508|4.0|An enjoyable read with a strong beginning and a surprising end, this book is filled with twists and turns that beg the question: is anyone who they appear to be? Set in the affluent neighborhood of Gordonston in Savannah, each page of this story unveils an intricate web of deceit and the hidden agendas of the residents, who hide hatred behind genteel manners and demonstrations of neighborly kindness. Courtesy of a mysterious assassin working for a secret organization, several of the characters seem destined to end up in an unmarked grave that is as shallow as they are. One of them will take a bullet, and I doubt you’ll be able to guess which resident meets their untimely end.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We have played it so much this was the second game...after a couple years and much playing...things start getting dog eared!  So I treated myself to a new game.  I'm 67 years old and I play it with my son, grand son and nephew.  Most games can eventually be figured out but this game has many moving parts and is different every game.....so it keeps being new and fun.
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 yr old daughter with Aspergers. I though she would enjoy a story about someone that didn't fit in because of how they were born. She really enjoyed it and could identify with it.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Another traditional visit to Discworld with Sir Sam & crew (and a cast of delicious new characters--and creatures) who tumble, battle, and brew, their way through what is, and plow their way towards what should be. Terry Pratchett is at his best when he carves his personal philosophies upon the Disc, and this adventure is either on par with--or slightly superior to--his more exhilarating treks.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game ever! Keep updating and making this the best of all games! Great job! Love it!
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  Those who are complaining about it just didn't know what they were buying.  Really?  You thought you would buy this for your grandchild?!?  That's just silly on your part.  Stop spending money on things when you have no idea what you are buying!  The menu allows for quick navigation to your favorite screens and you can fast forward through the several promotional trailers on this DVD.

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Much like the Beatles \\"White Album\\" is more a collection of wildly diverse and varied songs than a cohesive thematic piece that hangs together, Paul McCartney's \\"New\\" is equally a head-spinning collection of offerings that impresses with its creative disparate range and imaginative musicianship and production.  Similarly, while there were a small handful of sometimes inexpelicable \\"misses on that epic double album, the vast majority of the offerings were stark, fresh, bold, and successful songs that immediately grabbed your attention and imprinted themselves indelibly in the memory banks.<br /><br />So it is with \\"New\\", an album that frankly at age 71 for Paul McCartney is an amazing artistic achievement.  While some here have bemoaned the simplicity and directness of the lyrics, they are probably the most unflinching and personal statements he has made in his career, stirring in both their honesty as well as their show of vulnerability.  Paul has stripped off the layers of abstraction to a large degree, and many of his lyrics can be taken as both personal statements based on hard-won experience as well as offering wider interpretations to the individual listener to apply as each sees fit.<br /><br />The first eight songs are breathtaking, McCartney working with various producers at a pace and achievement level that is sequenced perfectly and balanced with nuance and verve.  It reaches an early emotional peak with \\"Queenie Eye\\", where an aging McCartney is still able to weave in the fun of childhood games as an analogy for the battles and challenges of life.  It's a remarkable song that will rank among his best at the end of his incredible career, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />The album does lose a bit of steam in its later moments, and the inexplicable \\"Road\\" does indeed go nowhere, seemingly, which may be the point.  Still, those are minor complaints, and even the weakest songs like \\"Hosanna\\" are generally quite listenable, if unremarkable in comparison to the brilliance of others like \\"Save Us\\", \\"Alligator\\", \\"New\\", \\"Early Days\\", \\"Appreciate\\", and others.<br /><br />All in all, this is not a good McCartney album...it is a great McCartney album, continuing a string of inspired and inspiring efforts begun about 15 years ago with \\"Flaming Pie\\" and continuing generally unabated since then.  Considering his age, his volume of work, and over 5 decades of music making, this may stand out as perhaps his most amazing and unprecedented achievement.  It manages to blend obvious touches and influences from McCartney's career, with nods to his Beatles and Wings records, while managing to sound fresh, modern, and vital.  Buy it.brilliance of others like \\"Save Us\\", \\"Alligator\\", \\"New\\", \\"Early Days\\", \\"Appreciate\\", and others.<br /><br />All in all, this is not a good McCartney album...it is a great McCartney album, continuing a string of inspired and inspiring efforts begun about 15 years ago with \\"Flaming Pie\\" and continuing generally unabated since then.

B00BAXFAOW|5.0|It appears to be human nature to make assumptions based on &#34;common sense.&#34; Gladwell's books do an excellent job of showing how wrong many of those decisions actually are. David and Goliath looks at multiple situations and shows how more power or force does not always mean more or better results.<br /><br />Blink and Outliers may still be my favorites of Gladwell, but this offers a clear look at the &#34;inverted U&#34; effect. This is the idea that more, or less, of something may show an improvement up to a point, but then the effect levels off before the effect actually becomes negative. One of his examples is class size. As a teacher I know that big classes are hard to manage, and difficult to reach. However, I also know that tiny classes are difficult in their own ways. This is the inverted U of class size which we would do well to consider.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Seems to be realistic for a kindle type game. Graphics and sound really pull you in. Lots of fun when you enjoy the real thing.
0399255370|3.0|My 1.5 year old loved this book the first week he had it and asked anyone near him to read it often. It is not one that has stuck beyond that as a favorite although the book is funny from the perspective of anyone who's had an angry team at the office. He did want to draw more for a while after that which I liked.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!  Hard to stop playing!  I even take it to work so I can play it during my break!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this weather app! It is user friendly and it is very accurate. The information it gives covers all areas of the weather that one needs to keep up with with.
B000W9399S|4.0|This book is the first of this authors work that I have read but it is comparible to Douglas Adams &#34;Hitchhickers Guide to the Galaxy&#34;, if you liked that or similar works this is an author to consider.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|One of the most popular apps out there, in my opinion.<br />Very easy to download and start using right away.<br />I'd suggest you go over your security and privacy settings to adjust it to your preferences.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Sprinkle Islands is done by the same developers who brought you Granny Smith and also the original Sprinkle. I've been a fan of Granny Smith since it came out, but somehow I managed to be totally oblivious of the Sprinkle franchise until today - not any more!<br /><br />This is a casual puzzle game where you are the resident fire marshal in charge of saving the town from fires caused by flaming space debris. The graphics, music and sound are superb - they come together to give that signature classy and laid-back feel that I love so much with Granny Smith. The overall game is very polished and well done. The first few levels do a great job introducing you to the game. It's very easy to pick up - not even half way through the intro levels, I was already putting flames out like a highly trained blue alien fire marshal armed with a sweet water cannon!<br /><br />The game only has one permission for network socket access, presumably for the links that take you to the developer's twitter and facebook pages. The installed footprint on my phone was around 28MB - as expected. So far, I haven't seen any ads or experienced any glitches or crashes.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind paying the regular price of $1.99 for this entertaining game. As the free app of the day, it's a must-have!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't even know where to begin. Really Veronica?! I thought we were friends? Really you are just a money grubbing writer who wants to \\"shock\\" readers(aka stab us in the back). Not only was the ending horrible, the story was AWEFUL! Stop reading after insurgent... Actually stop reading after divergent.... I will not see the movie, I will not read the inevitable sob stories that will be the four mini stories. I'm no longer your fan... Can I get a refund??
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|love the hidden puzzles ' and they create new ways to find objects not the same boring. find this find that.you will have to play to find out. also puzzles-memory match-so much fun if you want a long playing game that also challenges you this is it!love it

B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Amazing album!! I have his first two, which I absolutely love, but there's something a bit different about this one. It's purely amazing, almost a spiritual awakening of sorts.
014241493X|3.0|I Love John Green's writing. That said this is my least favorite novel of his thus far. The first 80 pages are amazing! The middle is so desperate to find metaphors of metaphors, and so self discovery, it makes me hate Q and Margo. Then it feels as if the story gets back on track with a hilarious and fun road trip and then the ending is so lackluster. Real but lack luster. Overall, i enjoyed it, glad I read it, but will not revisit this Paper Town.

I think NOT!!! (written by devoted Divergent fan, age 12)

006202406X|1.0|I had a lot of  hope for Allegiant after how wonderful Divergent and Insurgent are. But instead, this beautifully created world crumbles in a way that's not even productive. The plot is poor, the POVs are indistinguishable, and Tris' death is a poor attempt at being an \\"edgy\\" and \\"different\\" writer. I don't expect for all books I read to end how I want them to, but I also know that the readers who have loved this series from the beginning deserved a higher quality finale, one that didn't kill of a main character for shock value. I think I can speak for most when I say that this unfortunate book has ruined my loved for the first two, and I will no longer being seeing the movies now that I know how it ends. It's a shame too, because the movie is looking great, but I don't particularly want to re-live this poor plot. Do yourselves a favor - don't buy this, make up your own ending. Whatever you come up with is guaranteed to be better than what we got.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|All I will say is that it does feel like a let down. It's unfortunate because it makes it hard to still love the first two.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Interesting insight from the perspective of an analog crusader who was there during the transition to digital. Rock on Dave!

B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Funny but truthful thoughts about being black in America (US), Chimamanda then skillfully spiced it/added a love story to further made this novel more interesting. Good book and the reading flows smoothly, I suspect the account of Ifemelu (the Central character in this novel) is the personal experience of Chimamanda, but I maybe wrong though.

B001NLKZUA|4.0|I am not usually a fan of \\"teen vamp/werewolf\\" novels, but...I'm hooked on this series. It's well written,  a bit edgy and unpredictable. I love the authors nods to art, classic literature and scripture.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|(SPOILERS)<br /><br />The original Iron Man stands as one of the Top 5 Superhero films ever composed and set the foundation for an exciting franchise, but with the exception of Avengers, our red suited engineer has been in a tailspin since take two. I later came to appreciate Iron Man 2 as an action film and had every confidence the third would return the story to solid footing (as The Last Crusade did for Indiana Jones), but instead they went full steam ahead with the same problems that afflicted 2 and then added some more just to make sure. The most obvious was the irrelevant kid sidekick, but to be honest they lost me with the cliche setup of, \\"goofy people Tony overlooked in the past,\\" coming back as hardcore villains. If that wasn't bad enough, one of them is \\"yet another\\" smarmy business rival in the military-industrial complex. What, again? Just how many business rivals of Iron Man are going to go full evil? It's true he faces a large number of them in comics, but there were other enemies who could have fought without recycling that plot device for a Round 3.<br /><br />The Mandarin could have been one of them, but in order to make the concept behind the character work with the foregoing tried plot device, they had to whitewash the Mandarin into a drunk British actor masquerading as cocktail of anti-American movements while replacing his dramatically charged eco-terrorism into a limp-wristed commentary on how the military-industrial complex tries to manipulate both the supply and demand sides of the War on Terror.<br /><br />This was marketed as an intense and personal film with a strong revenge element, one that would pit Iron Man against a terrifying opponent, but ended up being the most disneyfied of the Marvel movies thus far: shallow themes, cartoony villains, a plot and protagonist trapped in a hamster wheel, with awkward resolutions to most unresolved plot threads.
B009Y6231U|4.0|Not the most elegant sci-fi ever made but can be an enjoyable thrill ride if you want it to be.  I've always found the musical score to be impressive and sometimes that's all some movies need for me to give them a more than passing grade (i.e. the Last Samuari).
B001NLL93W|5.0|Very good book.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Kept my interest from the very beginning to the very end.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The slide scanner is very easy to use and works relatively quickly. I have only used it for slides and not negative strips. The slot for slides is sometimes a little tight on my older slides, which seem to vary a little in size. I wish the display screen was a little bigger as it is sometimes hard to see words on the screen to know if I have correctly flipped/rotated the picture. Overall though the product is easy to use and a good buy.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Why? Why? Why? Why would you pay $2 for a game thats  worth 50 cents, this is only a demo!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|This is a hauntingly beautiful album. Playing it on vinyl is a must if you're a fan. I believe vinyl is my preferred media for this one, and I can't necessarily say that about other albums.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I suggest you must see from the first episode.  This was an enjoyable ride.  I had watched later seasons on TV, but having watched this first season put all the later shows in a frame that was easier to comprehend what was going on.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I got hooked on this series over the summer!!<br /><br />With each season, it got better and better. And since I don't typically watch TV shows during the week especially if it is late, this helped me catch up.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The Reacher saga moves on. It runs a little slow at first but half way through picks up good momentum.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minion Rush is a very fun game to play, but to unlock many of the features you have to  spend Gru tokens and those are to hard to come by unless you spend your entire day playing the game or pay cash for over priced tokens.  Maybe if you could trade 1000 banana for a Gru?
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It doesn't download the whole video, it downloads the video but then when playing it, it stops in middle with an error saying that it can't play it.
B000W9399S|5.0|Terry Pratchett's Discworld series is well known, and that fame is well deserved. This is the first book set in Discworld, and once you read this one you can skip anywhere in the series. Really fantastic, but be warned, it will likely cause you to laugh out loud in public places.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ooooookay. Where to start?<br /><br />I didn't cry while I was reading but after I put the book down and thought over it then the tears started to flow. I think that was closer to Four's reaction, that sense of lost and not being able to comprehend.<br /><br />I think lately authors have been pressured to stretch their series without adding to the storyline *coughs Sylvia Day coughs* and in some case damaging the characters' development. Divergent was absolutely just the right size for a series. All 3 books felt needed. Another big applause from me is how Roth wrote the two POVs. None of the chapters felt a repeat or just re reading a dialogue or a scene, it complemented each other while giving the audience a full 360 view of the situation. Very well done. I was able to read the last chapters imagining Shailene and Theo, I'm not familiar with any of their projects but it speaks volumes that I could see them while I was reading. I hope, not just the actors, but all the crew involved can do justice to the series in the big screen. I think Divergent is the industry best opportunity to come real close to Twilight success.<br /><br />Often author's will be left with tough decisions and I have a HUGE problem if they take the easy way out and \\"fade to black\\" or the BS \\"leave the end to the reader's imagination\\" *gives Lauren Oliver the sting eye*; that IMO is disrespectful to the characters, the audience as well as to themselves. Did I like that Tris died? Of course not! BUT I love and respect that Roth went for it. Was there ways to make it more mainstream perfect? Of course, Tris could have survived the shoots with major implications, being in a wheelchair maybe? Or just so perfect that she could survive without any injuries but would that have made justice to the characters? I don't think so.<br /><br />Instead of going through the rose colored glass, Roth took the tough choices head on, being brave just like Tris. And THAT felt real and translated to me. It felt real for her as an author, for Tris for being who she was and who she became, her fierce love and how strong she became, just like Four always told her that she was. For her at the end to KNOW that she belongs to herself and the people she loves and not to a mold anyone else tried to fit her into it. Amazing!<br /><br />If Veronica was going for the shock of killing a major character just for the shock of it, she could have just ended with the first reaction of Four hearing about her death when he comes back from the city, but no she made it real for him as well. Going through his very 1st sight of her, through the numb of knowing she's left and seeing her body to wanting to take the pain away, to forget the hurt (who hasn't hurt so much that they want to rip it off?), to realizing that to forget the pain is to forget her, her love and who he became because of her. . Talk about character development right there! He became true to himself because he lost her! It was raw, beautiful and real.<br /><br />Then Roth went ahead and showed her love to her secondary characters and gave them voice and closure, wrapping it all. Was it all flowers? No, but it was real, it was liberating to them to have this tribute to Tris at the end, for knowing they have love and each other. I love so much that she didn't give Four another love interest just to show life goes on.; unlike \\"The Hunger Games\\", which had all its conflicts resolved but at the end felt like the characters had no joy or purpose in life left, \\"Allegiant\\" gave you hope and purpose and a sense that yes,  sometimes you have to be brave just to keep going and in doing so you celebrate life and love and the person you lost just like Four realized. All around, with angst and sadness to the powerful mending message.... Perfection!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Ok, I'm hooked great show of mankind and the fight for survival, even with imminent danger and no likelihood of a normal life.

B000IEXVCC|5.0|A masterpiece. Lynch is a great director. I want to see this movie many times. A great twist of love.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the best movie ever.  It's a great plot line and it gives you a full range of emotions to experience from beginning to end.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love it! But then again, I love all their series! They have a lot of action with things I like watching.  Never a dull moment & like watching the &#34;bloopers&#34; part as well.they are hilarius to watch!! These shows are definately a 10 plus!! I'd even go higher if possible. My favorite show!!!
B000085RPU|5.0|I loved the original and I just had to have the Anniversary Edition! It's still great after 25 years!! If you liked the original you'll enjoy this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is definitely an exciting, fun filled game-full of suprises at every turn. What's funny is that kids can whiz right thru the levels and I really have to do some major thinking. Right now my brain is smoking but I come back and back for more punishment. Great game that makes you really put on your thinking cap.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|This was purchased as a replacement movie. When my daughter took it to a friend's house to watch, somebody decided they wanted it more than me.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Hilarious and entertaining .. Good family movie . It teach the value of  the family being one as a team!
B000002J6F|5.0|Loved the original double album, so great to get all on one disc. Such an huge talent, great songs inspiring images to remember.
B0053ZAPDE|4.0|They were right on time and I was very happy with them. The pricing was ok I thought they could've been better with the price due to the fact that they were used.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I'm a big r p g fan and this delivers even if you don't want to spend you just have to wait a bit.
1416583432|5.0|First, the author is a terrific writer and this makes reading this such a pleasure.  This book is filled with great insights, observations, and reports on the current research into dog intelligence and their place in our lives.  Highly recommend.

B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game!  Hours of entertainment.  Fun for the whole family.  Even my husband loves to play this game.
B00EP0SIOG|3.0|Without a grown up to set up this on a tablet,<br />there is no \\"toy\\", just a neatly ball.<br />I dislike the colors of blue and green plastic<br />and I can see this being used once at Christmas<br />when Dad or Mom has time and then,<br />finding the way to the back of the closet.<br />Buy your kid Lincoln logs that you both can play with and<br />that will be brought out again and again....
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|Such rich,gorgeous language. Great Halloween read.  Very disturbing and scary. Also a quick read. A classic to not be missed.
B00506NRBS|4.0|I found this a good book to read for clear cut ideas, but also some inspiring thoughts. Not just from Derek but others.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Absolutely LOVED it!<br />Can't get enough of the Supernatural series. Will be ordering more when I can. Thanks. Also, can't get enough of Dean Koontz. Love his books!

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|...who's never been good at speaking his heart directly. It just isn't in his ken. Withholding truthful reflection on himself isn't something he did to us on purpose. He's just never had it to give.<br /><br />The only hope to connect with this man as a human being is through metaphor, meaning and thought, which are no longer valued in average young folks' education, inclination, or empathic intuition. The currency of our realm has become thoughtless impulse.<br /><br />This album first made me cry, then inspired me to go back in time and begin to study what's relevant to how Dylan shares what he has to give--poetry, metaphor, and and most dauntingly, mythology. These things never 'took' with me, coming from a primitive home unable to encourage the effort required. His family was capable of loving him and leaving him alone, which, along with his early education in Judaism, lent a frame within which he chose to learn more on his own.<br /><br />Whoever produced this album sought and found the most intimate and tender renditions of parts of 'Bobby' before or after he went nuts coping with fame, then crafted them into a clear, warm recording which gives us access to his core. But only if you are equipped with an emotional listener part of yourself. Many are not.<br /><br />A couple of my favorites are 'Spanish Is The Loving Tongue' and 'Annie's Going To Sing Her Song', and 'Thirsty Boots'.<br /><br />I despair of our new normal--overproduced, digitally sound-boarded, inauthentic, soulless music performed by youngsters who haven't a clue or feeling about the meaning of what they're singing, who don't' bother to learn an instrument or learn to tell the stories of their hearts. If it can't be said in an abbreviated text message, it's too much trouble. (Edit: This was well demonstrated watching The Voice last night, in which most of the singers didn't know lyrics to, but were being encouraged to 'emote' while singing The Dixie Chicks' 'I'm Not Ready To Make Nice', withoutbeing told to go read the story behind the song, just to 'connect to it'. And neither girl thought on her own to go google the song. The result was predictably bizarre. ACK!)<br /><br />If you're a Dylan Addict, angry at the financial machinations of Dylan's purveyors over the years, keeping track of what you've spent on this or that, measuring albums against a content standard, this album will not speak to you.<br /><br />But for me, it rekindled my gratitude to 'Bobby' for lending meaning to our lives, especially now, when the landscape is so barren, for a sixty-four year old lady who was too wrapped up in being a 'revolutionary' adolescent in Berkeley college days as we anxiously awaited his next album, to delve more deeply into what the hell he was talking about.<br /><br />If you get this album, I hope you enjoy it.
B008KYWN0S|4.0|I wear this shoe around the house as a slipper, to and from work for my commute/walk in, while picking my kids up at day care in the playground sand and water, and with casual weekend outfits.  I get compliments all the time!  They are easy to wash and comfy on the feet.  I have three pairs now.  I do feel they wear a little fast on the bottom, but after all they are soft plastic.

0062107313|4.0|Violet was raised in a courtesan house in Shanghai run by her American mother Lulu. Lulu was not only the madam of one of the most exclusive courtesan house, but a rich and well connected business woman. As a daughter of a powerful American woman, Violet considered herself above courtesans and Chinese people. She later found out that her father was Chinese and she was only half American. That fact added to her self identity problems.<br /><br />When Violet was 14, Lulu decided to leave Shanghai to go home because of the political instability. Then, Lulu was tricked by her lover, and ended up leaving Violet behind. Violet was sold to another Courtesan house and forced to become a virgin courtesan. Violet experienced many heartaches, and eventually learned to live her life as well as possible.<br /><br />I have read every book (except for children's books) by Amy Tan. And she is one of my favorite authors. \\"The Valley of Amazement\\" would be my 4th favorite of hers after 1)[[ASIN:B006U1OB80 The Hundred Secret Senses]], 2)[[ASIN:0143038095 The Joy Luck Club]], 3)[[ASIN:0345457374 The Bonesetter's Daughter: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)]].<br /><br />These are the reasons why \\"The Valley of Amazement\\" is not my number one favorite;<br /><br />1) I love Amy Tan's sense of humor. She can make you laugh while you are crying, but this novel didn't have it.<br /><br />2) This novel reminded me of [[ASIN:0679781587 Memoirs of a Geisha: A Novel]]. Unconsciously, I was comparing them. Finding similarities and differences between Japanese courtesan house and Chinese one was interesting, but I don't think it's a good way to enjoy a new novel by such a talented author.<br /><br />3) It's unnecessarily long. It could be shorter.<br /><br />4) Too predictable.<br /><br />5) Mother daughter relationship story of Lulu, Violet, and Flora didn't add very much to the story. It unnecessarily complicated the story.<br /><br />However, Amy Tan is still a great story teller, and thereare many beautiful moments. It's much better than the last novel [[ASIN:1441839860 Saving Fish from Drowning]]. It's as good as [[ASIN:0143038109 The Kitchen God's Wife]]. Welcome back, Amy!
B0089LOG02|4.0|A great example of someone who has a rough life finding someone who had even harder times and learning from that. It is a painful story but certainly interesting and memorable.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|I have always been a fan of Sandra Boynton. The Going To Bed Book is comic fun that my four year old enjoys. I enjoy that he likes it and it is short (for those nights when a short story before bed is required). We now have the board book for home and the Kindle edition for when we are away.

B0089XH38M|1.0|I have never seen an anti-virus program with so many unnecessary, obtrusive and downright dangerous permissions and I have used several. This program has morphed from anti-virus to data mining. Many users are beginning to complain about their browsers being hijacked, contacts being used to send spam texts and emails promoting this product as well as affiliated products, and so forth. There is no excuse for any anti-virus program to not only access but also be able to utilize user's contacts data for whatever purposes AVG sees fit; permissions as they are now give them complete control over nearly all of your information without restraint. There is also zero necessity to track and record your whereabouts via your own built-in GPS with no option to prevent them from doing so. The list goes on and on and on. I urge everyone to take a long hard look at ALL permissions this program is requesting access to before you install. Be cautious. These are some serious privacy invasions and should not be taken lightly. While anti-virus programs do require more permissions than other programs to work effectively; this one goes far beyond what is necessary and into the danger zone. There are other excellent anti-virus programs available that work just as well, if not better, without all the unnecessary permissions. Best of luck --
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Enough said.<br /><br />This is by far one of my favorite Sting albums/songs/creations of all time. Definitely recommend. Can't wait to see it on Broadway.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|After watching out the remainder of the season on cable I canceled my pre-order. As OCD as I want to be to say I own all of the seasons, I just cannot bring myself to buy this brand new. I was so disappointed with the direction this particular season took in the end - as they could have gone so many different directions - such as more with the budding, young, wealthy protege and the relationship with Hannah. Explain to me again WHY she'd return to a city where she is federally wanted and doesn't even make an effort to disguise herself? A dye job even, something. I liked the introduction of the good Dr. Vogel and her role in Dexter's life. I like that Dexter is becoming more humanized - though I do miss his typical cutthroat nature - and the relationship with Deb improves after some very rough waters. But ultimately, the ending is what has me perplexed and disappointed. Than again, I was one of those people who when Sopranos ended thought my cable had gone out. Maybe I missed something but how Dexter went out is absolutely in contrast to how he lived by Harry's/Vogel's survival rules.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|This game is exactly like car racing for android.  The car names at  fake but everything else is solid. The graphics and game play is pretty smooth.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works well enough for 35 bucks. Wish it had Pandora and Amazon instant video on it. Netflix and Youtube are getting a little thin.
B00BC5I6Q2|1.0|Sorry. But there is not one single character that approaches likable on this overrated hard to watch series. Who cares. It is silly, badly written and worse, mediocre to bad acting. Should be called: Kevin Spacey in \\"drag\\".<br />Certainly not the same caliber of work from director of the Social Network. But was Fincher even really involved?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start playing this game it is hard to stop. Love it. A game that is fun for all ages. Give it a try.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this one is really good and i love to play it, but it does annoy me also. its not easy.
006202406X|4.0|I must say, everything about this book was unexpected. I loved the first 2 books and couldn't wait to tear into this one. I should have  known the world created in the first books had to change, and the twists in this book keeps you guessing. I love that it wasn't predictable. This whole series was thrilling and beautiful.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The purchase went flawlessly and would recommend anyone purchasing it from this supplier. As for the movie itself, I found this second installment with this cast to be much more entertaining and overall more enjoyable story line than the first. Highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King did it again. Another book that kept me up all night because I couldn't put it down. I liked it better than than The Shining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so addictive and so fun, once you start playing you can't put it down. Highly recommend this game to everyone
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does just what I want it to do. I love the simplicity of the app. I've tried other calculator apps and this one is my favorite by far.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I chose this book having seen the TV series and I have to say, I loved it.  It's  quick read and very compelling.  It really gave me more insight into this period of English history.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I am a noob at building computers so I didn't know the K is for chips that can overclock. Still I like what I got, works well and with the liquid cooler on this I have happy temps.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|The main character is endearing and interesting, and this is a good peek into the world of academics as well as the mind of a person who thinks very differently than most people. There were some delightful turns of phrase throughout, and some very poignant moments. A thoroughly enjoyable book.
B005JE7WKI|3.0|This could easliy be 5 stars, but they show you ALL the best parts in the previews.  Still if you're looking for a funny movie that SOMEONE else has not seen this would be a good choice then. (just dont let them see the previews).
B0052GACNM|5.0|Great music.  They don't make them like this anymore.  Full orcastra behind the singers.  Not three guitars and a drummer.
0800141806|3.0|Good movie, do not own but have seen it on television a couple times recently. At the end of the day Mr. Beckett is reliable for his own demise. Point blank, he hid his disease from his employers (and yes AIDS is a disease not a handicap) which could have put others at risk (obviously under certain circumstances). Mr. Beckett was even given the opportunity to address his disease to his employers when they gave him the case at the beginning of the movie and one of his bosses asked him what the mark on his head was, instead of answering \\"its a lesion from my AIDS\\" he answers \\"I hit my head\\" at that point he concealed it and his disease kept him from doing his job as he went to the hospital for incontinence and was there at the time when his paperwork came up missing (also he went to great lengths with cosmetics to hide his lesions). Mr. Beckett also reveals he contracted the AIDS by hooking up with a stranger at a gay porn theater. Its sad he got AIDS, but he and he alone was responsible for his demise both career wise and health wise. Most of the reviews on here champion Mr. Beckett as a hero when he gives credit to the stereotype that gay men are AIDS carrying perverts!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is hands down the best hunting game I have ever played.I'd give it ten stars but it only allows five lol.great job

140006922X|5.0|One of the most researched and thoughtful books I have read in many years, I will gift wrap more for friends & family.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|This was a wonderful story.  The characters and the descriptions were great.  I was right there with them in the cave and then the in the village with the lost souls.  The story line was brilliant and new to me.  I like how the parents were suddenly back in her life and how her soul mate was returned.  The relationships displayed true love.  The families were strong and there for one another.  I don't know what to say about Fallyn though.  All in all it was a great read.  One that I didn't put down until finishing the story.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|The pain characters are both absolutely adorable.<br />I loved the conversations they shared with each other, and themselves! Made me smile more than once...
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I really like how it kept me on the edge of my seat. It is a really good book for anybody.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Pretty solid comic book movie. Good action, a little drama, and comic relief with Robert Downey Jr. Worth wasting a few hours if you want to watch this type of movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that candy crush app for kindle is here, this game is so much fun and very very addicting!
B009A9ETFE|5.0|Amazing CD!  This band writes,plays and sings so wonderful, and different that, I have been the biggest Bon Jovi fan since 1983. I can't get enough of this band H.I.M, to the point I went to their concert instead of Bon Jovi, which I had 3rd row seats too.  I do not regret my decision at all.  H.I.M and this CD among all their others are so underrated for now. They are getting huge as they should be as more and more people hear them.  The concert I went to, they were they second band to go on out of 3. Everyone walked out on the headlining band Volbeat after H.I.M. was done playing.  If that doesn't say how much this band is loved and respected. We heard on the internet that it happened at all the concerts and the first band dropped out.  This CD is amazing.  Ville Valo is the singer/writer of all their music. He is beyond brilliant. He's very easy on the eyes. Gorgeous, to bad he doesn't see this.  If there's one band you need to hear, it's H.I.M!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game but can get frustrating at times. I recommend it to other people if they like puzzle games.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I give this three stars because I waited for this book and was disappointed by it. The first two were great so I had what better expectations. I mean what did she expect from her readers when she wrote this? (Sigh) oh well
B0036S4B6M|2.0|This book is terrible slow. It could be summed up in several \\"almost \\" bullet points. Just when something starts to be interesting, it turns out that nothing happened at all- just almost.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is super repetitive which some people would find annoying, but I find it to be an incredibly relaxing time waster. Credence is added by the VAST number of dragons you can breed and keep.<br /><br />I have a few problems however, the expand time doubling everytime you expand is annoying for one. another is that I often have to use a website to figure out how to breed certain dragons for quests. I think the game should tell you that if it wants you to breed a certain kind. the last major drawback is that you often get completely swamped with quests! and half of them I cant complete because I haven't bred a certain dragon. I just think quests you cant do shouldn't be added until you meet the prior criteria for them is all.<br /><br />Anyways all in all great free game if you want to waste time and like dragons and relaxing.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Really fun game, just wish the cash was a bit easier to obtain or the amounts were greater.  Also the costs for research are crazy high I once went through over a million coins and only got three DNA strands :(
B003GK224I|3.0|A fairly good but predictable detective story.  Not really memorable so on the plus side if you were to read it again a year later you might find it o.k. again having forgotten the story.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Like a kindle sized Diablo and can't believe it is free to play! If you haven't done much on the kindle this game is a must!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love this whole series and am patiently (sort of) waiting for the next instalment.  One of the best fantasy/adventure series that i've ever read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's great hands down. There's no glitches and changes. It is as if you're playing on the phone. I have no regrets getting it
B0052RDHTM|3.0|It's a good book, but not a page-turner (for me anyways).  All his books are good - some more so than others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzle games and this one is completely different than any other I've played.  It's very addictive and super fun!  I love it and want to play it all the time! Can't wait to play when I get home everyday.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Finding pride is the first book in the series. I loved it so much that I couldn't put it down. It's definitely worth the time and I can't wait to get started on the next.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|Using this book on a kindle is very slow, navigation takes a long time. The book needs to be updated.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Highly recommend this dvd to anyone interested in recording studios or the history of recording in the past. Great musicians and songs on this dvd. Dave Grohl is the man!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|An amazing journey both physically and spiritually. Cheryl's descriptive writing allows the reader to share this adventure as though we are on the trail with her.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This thing is sharp and sturdy at the same time. It can chop would  and even be thrown though it is a little difficult. Highly recommended.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|Eat,pray,love was refreshing and fun, this book is dribble & disappointing, written at the level of middle school. At 500 pages, I thought it must get better but a third through, I gave up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so so so HAPPY that I can finally play Candy Crush on my kindle. Now I never ever have to leave my couch!!!!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Thanks for this excellent conversion. I think perhaps I may have found one typo. Certainly not more than that. Good job!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Love all the characters and the deadpan humor. Fun ride. Just saw Red 2 and it was also a decent movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book grabbed your interest immediately and was hard to put down. A real page turner! It's definitely a woman&#34;s book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I tried this on a phone and it was fun I am trying to install it now on my grandma's kindle as I am writing a review at the same time.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I am using. first gen kindle fire and I am having no problems.  I wish there were more levels in the free games.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Calculator Pro is one of the easiest and best calc apps available.  We have tried many and like this one best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game,some levels can be very challenging and the game is very addicting! Lol, so glad it's FINALLY available on the kindle :)
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was an eye awakening story of women in the prison system.  Very inspiring and interesting.  I would recommend this book!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Other than the CD plastic was smashed and broken beyond recognition, the CD is great and works without a scratch. The selections are beautiful and of course done so well to listen and put anyone in the Christmas mood. All I need now is snow in Texas!
B000VHXD7O|4.0|Its a John Wu film with pretty good acting by most and a great performance by Adam West.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is playing the same role as in Moonstruck. Cher does not make a guest appearance, but it seems like a convincing portrait of 1940's attitudes, except that they stop being bigoted.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As all of Gladwell's writing, it make you think and think and think! Worth a read. You will not be disappointed.
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|So far I am enjoying this game. I broke down and got the paid version. I get the jest of the game just not the strategy or finesse quite yet. But then figuring that out with any game is where the fun lies! Still prefer Secret Society but this fills the time nicely. You travel to different cities visiting galleries, auction houses, and coffee shops sell, buying, and moving art. The art is real and diverse. To get discounts one finds items in the art forcing you to focus on the details of the piece or getting to know the artists. A pretty game that pits you against yourself. I have to give it a buy.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great story. I even shed a few tears. Could not put the book down. I started reading when it was released on the 22nd. I do with the books were a bit longer.
1609611543|3.0|I chose this book because my daughter in law and son have found out their whole family have an allergy to wheat.<br />I thought I could loose weight by going off wheat and loose the belly fat.<br />This is really extreme and I do not stay on it as closely as I should. Therefore, I have seen no improvement in either my<br />weight or tummy fat!  I have chosen to go with Weight watchers and just stick to their diet which includes wheat.<br /><br />I do feel this doctor is on target and I am re-reading the book to try and see if I can be more self controlled.<br /><br />If you are self disciplined enough to stay on it and if the doctor advises  this for you then I think this book would be<br />helpful and encouraging....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just downloaded kindle app. I am addicted stayed up past past bedtime. I need way more lives.  please friend me and help me out...lol!@@
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|The premise of this and books like it is that you can manifest anything you like by believing (wishing) hard enough. I bought this expecting a more scientific approach that would demonstrate the real world applications (however minute) of quantum theory. I did the experiments anyway (because why not?) and they utterly failed. Good luck with this book, because that's the only way it will succeed for you.
B0002XL35G|3.0|Acting: 4/5 The kid did a great job<br />Story: 2/5  Does not make any sense in most parts of the movie<br />Dialogue: 4/5 well done<br />Music:  4/5  very well done by Ry Cooder (the guitar is great)<br /><br />Overall a good movie but definitely not a 4 or 5 stars
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|The book really doesn't have a &#34;hook&#34; like the others. I'm just not as compelled to keep reading. I'm sure I'll pick it back up at some point, but there are some compelling reads that I've got to finish first.
B00DYQLEZM|5.0|This 50 CD box from Deutsche Grammophon (DG) was issued to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Berlin Philharmonic in 2013.<br />-- Not to be confused with the 12 CD box that the Berlin Philharmonic issued to celebrate itself in 2006: [[ASIN:3898162478 Berliner Philharmoniker - Im Takt der Zeit]]<br /><br />The contents of the DG Box were chosen by the public, or at least the 40,000 members of the public who responded to an internet poll.<br />The contents of the Orchestra's Box were selected by a vote of the orchestra members.<br /><br />The public and the orchestra agreed on three selections, all from the 78rpm period:<br />1913: Alfred Hertz: Wagner Suite from Parsifal<br />1920: Artur Nikisch: Berlioz Roman Carnival Overture<br />1928: Jascha Horenstein: Bruckner Symphony 7<br /><br />The Orchestra's Box includes all six Music Directors, plus seven guest conductors.<br /><br />A glaring omission from the DG Box is Sergiu Celibadache, who was Music Director of the Berlin Philharmoic from 1945-1952.<br />But he made no recordings for DG.<br />A large number of radio broadcasts have survived: [[ASIN:B00E5Q9UAQ Sergiu Celibidache: The Berlin Recordings, 1945-1957]] - and - [[ASIN:B004S8GXLK Edition Sergiu Celibidache - Comp Rias Recordings]]<br /><br />Aside from five of six Music Directors, the DG Box includes thirteen guest conductors, none of whom were included in the Orchestra's Box:<br />Richard Strauss, Bruno Walter, Hans Knappertsbusch, Ferenc Fricsay, Igor Markevich, Karl Bohm, Paul Hindemith, George Szell, Rafael Kubelik, Eugen Jochum, Leonard Bernstein, Carlo Maria Giulini, and Pierre Boulez.<br /><br />The Orchestra's Box could have included selections from those conductors, but orchestra members could not agree. Office politics?<br /><br />The Orchestra's Box gave one CD each to guest conductors Erich Kleiber, David Oistrakh (as conductor), Daniel Barenboim, Kurt Sanderling, and Nikolaus Harnoncourt, none of whom are included in the 50 CD DG box.<br />Again there is a simple explanation - none of these conductors recorded for DG (they did record with the Berlin PO for Telefunken, EMI, Sony and Teldec).<br /><br />(Gustavo Dudamel was also left out of the Orchestra's box, but he had not yet conducted the orchestra in 2006).<br /><br />The DG box also includes 9 CDs of concerti.<br />Original jacket format, nice booklet, nice price.<br /><br />If I greet the DG Box with Modified Rapture, its because I already own 41 of the 50 CDs (everything from Nikisch through Karajan).<br /><br />If you are a newcomer to classical music, you are in luck.<br />You get to experience Unmodified Rapture.>Again there is a simple explanation - none of these conductors recorded for DG (they did record with the Berlin PO for Telefunken, EMI, Sony and Teldec).<br /><br />(Gustavo Dudamel was also left out of the Orchestra's box, but he had not yet conducted the orchestra in 2006).<br /><br />The DG box also includes 9 CDs of concerti.<br />Original jacket format, nice booklet, nice price.<br /><br />If I greet the DG Box with Modified Rapture, its because I already own 41 of the 50 CDs (everything from Nikisch through Karajan).<br /><br />If you are a newcomer to classical music, you are in luck.<br />You get to experience Unmodified Rapture.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great, fun game!  Once you get started, its nearly impossible to put it down.  Some levels make you want to pull your hair out, but just when you're frustrated enough to quit, you'll magically make it through and on to the next.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|if you liked the 1st two in the serise, I recommend this one as well.  There is a lot that happens in this book that keeps you wanting to read.  Some of it is predictable, but still very good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you've made up your mind about the characters, this story takes a U-turn.  The devious mind of the female protagonist is something to fear.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|I have not had this app more than a few days. So far it very enjoyable. It has many different levels and a wide assorment of programs. It is not boring.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This game is really fun and just as  enjoyable as my home computer game.  I will recommend this to others.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I think this was a fantastic book. I read it in one day as I simply could not put it down. You truly need to read the previous two books to have an idea of what is going on, this just wont work as a stand-alone. I see a lot of reviewers on the big sites complaining about the conclusion to this series and I am stunned. Perhaps it is not the giddy, happy, ending you expected? I believe the author allowed the story to go in the direction that it naturally would take. Everything led up to this conclusion and although it left me in tears, I feel it was not a huge surprise or a real let-down. You cant always get the perfect happy ending. How boring would books be if every ending consisted of \\"and they lived happily ever after\\", that is for fairly tales. This story, was NOT, a fairy tale.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|If there is something you want to know or see just Google it. I don't know what I would do with out Google now.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Not the usual premium British movie i'm used to but it was ok.  Would have preferred to not have to pay for it though.  Should have just streamed it so it could be deleted.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ok. I can not believe that Allegiant ended with Tris dying and Tobias living. The first 2 were good but this last one totally killed my thought about the series.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This was pretty good!  Did make me laugh and was enjoyable!  Love Judy Dench and would watch this one again!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Memorable, enjoyable, easy to learn game ... fun to create your own little piece of virtual heaven ... if you liked other G5 virtual City games, you will incorporate all you learned into this one

B004DLPXAO|4.0|Felt it was easy to download the app. Easy to find reading material I like. Have had no problems and enjoy.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Love the band, and was patiently waiting this release and it didn't disappoint!  You can tell they have a great time making the music due to the perfection of sound coming from such a large group!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is fine for people that have got plenty of time but is a bit boring at times.I do have Fun playing it though when I have the Time To spend on it .
B00AJLHULW|3.0|Was sort of disappointed with this disc, not for content, but the packaging clearly showed &#34;Demo Only, Not for Resale&#34;, and had no data within.  Music is good, so once I digitized it, not an issue.
1452101426|5.0|the product is like in the photos if not better!<br />very nice packaging and book without a scratch!<br />I love it!<br />I would absolutely recommend!<br />super fast shipping!
141694737X|5.0|My son loves reading (being read to, as he's only 19 months old), and he selects a few of his favorites to read every night before bed. This is always one of them. He loves going along with me and lifting the tabs, discovering the animals and making animal sounds before closing the tabs and flipping the pages. The story is cute and easy for a small child to follow. The flaps are actually quite sturdy and easy for small fingers to lift.
B000IZ21BS|5.0|What a classic.  You have not seen Child's Play you have not lived a normal life.  What a great movie.  I let my 4 year old nephew watch it and they loved it!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I am completely addicted to this series. I can not wait for the movie to come out. Such an attention grabber. I hated how open the ending was, after watching the special features I understood. I was upset to watch the season 4 clip and not actually get a season 4 :(. Everything will be resolved come movie or MULTIPLE movies shall I say :)
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The book was eye-opening.  There are many fascinating facts here about the period and  about the life and times of the people who lived in Jerusalem when Jesus was a young man.  It seems very well documented.  I recommended it to a friend, who was skeptical at first, but he read it and liked it very much.
006202406X|5.0|I just finished reading this book this morning, working really gets in the way, anyway this ending I feel is perfect for this series. Of course I am not happy about it. What I am REALLY not happy about is the fact that people are giving it such a poor rating because Tris was killed off. I get it we all fell in love with Tris and Tobias and of course them together and having a happy life. I had a feeling they were not going to end up together some way or another through out the whole series. Did I want it? Of course. I felt though Tris had to die... Tough to say and hear. She had to sacrifice herself for the ones she loved. She wanted to make sure everything would change. She made that happen. Veronica Roth is a fantastic writer. Did we as fans have a happy ending no. Did we have a very Divergent ending yes. This is a different kind of series. This ending just solidifies it. I would not want anything less from this series. I am very happy with how it turned out.<br /><br />Fantastic Series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a fun game for anyone. Once you start on a level, you can't stop! It is free, but you can buy power ups. You can also buy through hard levels, but to me it is fun to try over and over, paying to win sounds like cheating.
0007435185|5.0|Some people like to read and are hardly ever without a book in their hands.  That's not me.  I like to read but seldom find the time.  A good friend recommended &#34;The Alchemist&#34; by Coehlo.  I took her advice and am so glad I did.  I thoroughly enjoyed it  I like the way this author thinks and is able to get his points across.  I will be reading much more of his work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I broke my phone and have been disappointed when I tried to get it on my kind til one day I tried again then BAM!! It worked. YES, I don't have no worries.

B007JRUCGO|4.0|Ignore all reviews on Feb 2, 2012.  There are dozens of them, all uniformly bad.  Some bored kid spent hours writing and posting bad reviews using different names.<br /><br />This movie kept five kids between the ages of 5 and 9 engrossed for an hour and forty minutes. These days that's hard to do.  'Nuff said.
0061950726|4.0|Orphan Train is a fascinasting read of a little known situation in American history.  I had no idea that children during the great depression and even before were taken from the streets of New York and put on trains to find new homes in the midwest.  The author does an excellent job of telling this story interlaced with the present.  The ending, however, is rushed and somewhat hokey and beneath the standard of this fine book.  I did not want the story to end.  There was more to tell, but the author chose to close with the story tied up with a neat bow. Deanna Kasten
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Excellent little game for the Kindle Fire. Looking forward to more levels. Good graphics and use of logic. Had to tap a few times to get things to work.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love that it keeps track if sleep patterns on top of everything else - only complaint is it's so small and light it's easy to set down and misplace, I've taken to keeping it either in the sleep wrist or he belt clip<br /><br />Oh and yes customer service is overwhelmed currently but I understand they are taking steps to correct but once you do get ahold of customer service they are awesome!!!!!
031603441X|1.0|Point number one - if Keith Richards wrote this \\"book\\" then pleased to meet you I'm the next pope. It's perfectly obvious that Richards either yammered on endlessly while sitting next to a tape recorder or while sitting next to Fox. Fox no doubt had to then spend god knows how many days listening to the crap and try to assemble it in to some sort of presentable format; I wouldn't be at all surprised if Fox wound up doing some of the drugs that Richards prattles on about, if only to ensure that he completed what must have been a soul destroying task. I don't think there was a sentence longer than 5 words in the entire book.....if there was then two of the words would have comprised someone's name. The schoolboy ravings about knives and guns are laughable. The stuff about drugs is just boring, that sort of story has been told to death. This book should really only serve to finally deflate the infantile myth about Richards the rebel, the outlaw and the \\"pirate\\"(pirate? give me a break).....here was a guy who could play the guitar and wrote some great songs. All the rest is just garbage.

B0089LOG02|4.0|I read this with my book group and enjoyed it.  I especially liked the parts which took place 90 years ago. The modern stuff was not as well written or as interesting to me.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|By far not their best album, but it's alright. More I listen to it the more I like it though.
0307279189|3.0|I did lend this book from my local library as I believe in supporting them (they track usage).<br /><br />Pros:  Interesting Subject and Characters (some of them)<br />Cons:  The writing is scatterbrained, disorganized and without flair.  The story does not delve very deeply into the spiritual side of the Tamahumara tribe - isn't that supposed to be one of the reasons why they run so fast?<br /><br />The book is worth a read though I wish the writer had dug a little deeper and polished this little gem of a story to the luster it deserves.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Love this movie, have watched it a few times. Was my favorite Leonardo DiCaprio movie until Django Unchained came out.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game! It only needs redstone, nether portals, and fix dat realms up a bit.COMPLETLY worth the seven dollars!! They just need to make it more like PC version and by the way they need worlds to be infinite or at least bigger.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series!  What I liked the most is that the conversations are depicted with care, honor & eloquence whenever good or bad news is given.  We can learn from this.  Also, honor of individuals is portrayed very well.  We can learn about communicating more effectively from this series.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I like this app for latest weather over the world. I would suggest this app to anyone for people who are travelling and who are in need of local weather. :)
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love this pen.  It works great, and much better than the cheaper stylus.  It has three different sizes in one pen.  It is made well.  The other stylus seem to be a bit flimzy and cheaply made.  This is NICE.  I do recommend this product.  It was well worth it to me to pay the extra money for it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another great book by RR.  I can't wait for the new one!  It's a perfect mix of mythology and fantasy.
B000HF0KXU|4.0|The movie is well made, Jackman is really really good, Berry is wonderful, and Cheadle is excellent like always. But really, who stole the show is Travolta. His character was over the top and deliberately so. The concept of the greater good and sacrifice is embodied in what he does and what he says. Yet, the part is played deftly, and surprisingly understated, by Travolta. What would you do? Whose life is expendable? Leaders in wartime make these decisions every day. And so does Travolta. That is the real point behind the movie, and that is what the movie really banks on. So, if it were true, would you want a person like that doing this work?<br /><br />Full-tilt action, the hacking seems overwrought and to my mind unbelievable, but it does get the point across. Other than that, a fine carnival ride that is a little more than just the empty calories. Enjoy!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It always crashes and has the ad but it says I have to get the pro version NO! Pro cost money I don't have credit on my kindle I'm broke and I hate  how it's crashes someone out there help us all make a better youtube app

1933771690|5.0|Here is a book which is the best available on its subject for deep thinkers. It is acutely attacked by persons, religious as well as certain scientists, who are deeply entrenched in their own philosophies. There is a line in the book &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; that goes something like this:<br />Prejudices are deeply imbedded, un removable, like the weeds between the stones of a garden path.<br />Lanza is correct in his statement that science will not go anywhere, not find their Theory-Of-Everything until the take the horse away from the rear of the cart.<br />Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, the myriad of other world religions including the 125 odd Protestantisms, all know they have the only and true religion. Some of us fighting to the death to defend its truths. Scientists, having so much invested in their own theories, refusing to give in. Poopoeing any deviation from the beaten path, ignoring scientific test results proven in the lab all over the world since the middle 1930ties and steeped in self importance, all critical of this book, a book far ahead of its time.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen has always been one of my favorite authors.  He kept me in suspense again for the whole book.  How he spins people's lives is a mystery to me.  I hope that he has another sequel.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|In today's operatic world, there aren't many tenors who can match Jonas Kaufmann. Not only is his voice a powerhouse, with a range that soars up to high C almost effortlessly, but the nuances that he is able to achieve (from ppp to fff, and back smoothly with no break), are incredible.  Couple this great technique with passionate emotion and feeling, an ear and erudition for the language, and the ability to create character personae that perfectly reflect the composer's intent, and you have a unique and moving artist.  For instance, in &#34;Celeste Aida&#34;, that formidable first aria of Radames, the last high note is marked pp  (most tenors sing it ff), and Kaufmann, with obedience to Verdi's score, sings it with an exquisite pp, thus enhancing the meaning of the aria.  In listening to all the selections, many give me chills up my spine, (especially his Wagner), and I am unabashedly thrilled with the entire album.  The deluxe version is beautifully designed, with several great pictures of Mr. Kaufmann.
B00BAXFCPO|1.0|Here we go again.  Another doc telling us to consume a low carb high animal protein diet to save our brains.  Yeah right, Dr. Perlmutter.

1250038820|5.0|I stumbled across the HONY blog a while back and when I found out there was a book coming out, I knew I wanted it. Mine plus three more to give away as Christmas presents. As a photographer, I do find the photographs interesting but my favorite part is the stories that go along with them. I love seeing the variety of people that he comes across. The book shows truncated versions of many of the stories- I think he did a great job. Love it.
B0012NO316|5.0|Excellent adaptation of this play-pretty close to original text. Elizabeth Taylor is insane!<br /><br />I recommend watching this after having read the text to really appreciate the nuances.

0345530578|2.0|Why John Grisham finds this character of interest is beyond my comprehension. I couldn't find even one point in the book where I believed in the main character or cared what happened to him. I slogged through it...it's well beyond my interest in organized crime and brutality. I guess every author is allowed one klunker, this has got to be it.
