B007V65R54|5.0|Clever use of real world examples to illustrate some complex concepts about statistics, probability and forecasting - a great read
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This app is perfect! The sounds are very relaxing, and quite realistic. And being able to mix sounds is a plus! My personal favorites are the underwater-sounds and the softly playing melody. (Though I'm sure that there are better ones out there :P) The combinations are endless, and most are interesting AND relaxing. The only downside is that this app won't continue to play in the background while you are doing other things. (I.e. browsing the web, playing games..) but still, all in all, this app is really good. And on top of that, it's free! ^-^<br />~~<br />(Pardon my bad grammar, if any.. i am simply an aspiring evil genius, taking over the world a little bit at a time.. Only kidding, only kidding.. lol)
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I have been looking for a good read since I finished \\"Dance with Dragons\\". I read numerous books in search of one to captivate me. I love that feeling of being enamored. This book did it for me. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

B001P1MZNI|5.0|This album shows you one of the sides of Frank. Its humors are of its times and Sinatra seems relaxed and enjoying his own show with the crowd. The Album demonstrates that even he enjoyed singing and having fun!
B00B10ENBA|3.0|I wanted to see this film, because I lived through this bit of history.  I thought the scenes in Iran and at the Canadian ambassador's house lame and over-dramatized.  I saw the old movie about how the Canadians saved the Americans and was impressed, this new film is Hollywood script and illusions gone wrong again, for the almighty dollar.  The Canadians and their government should have the US citizens thanks every day.  They saved us then and on September 11, 2001, no one has a neighbor like them, in this world.  Thank you Canada.  I'm from Michigan..so I meet Canadians every day...Love 'em.  Now....Buckeyes...yech...
B0081J9OWC|5.0|This album is awesome. I really didn't think they could beat &#34;Home&#34; but &#34;That's What's Up&#34; is such a great song. If you like fun, kind of hippie music, this is a really great album for you.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver provides and insightful analysis of many topics in an interesting and thoughtful writing style. This should be required reading for all students.
B008OOYALE|2.0|The game frequently won't connect to the Internet on my kindle which makes it unplayable. I loved the game until I realized you can play forever without making enough coins to upgrade. It costs a fortune for a small section and then tens of thousands to clear it, all while trying to grow food and buy new items to finish quests. I am finding it to daunting to enjoy any further :(
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been on Pinterest for months and now I can take it anywhere. I love having the convenience of having it on my Kindle.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This is an awesome book.If you haven't read the rest of the series YOU should.I loved the BOOK and it deserves 2 thumbs up.If only I had more thumbs
B005D63ICI|5.0|Dexter is great and this season is not exception. We are addicted and will be purchasing another season until we catch up.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. The fact that it was based on real events made it very intense. The actors were very good, the film was accurate in it's content. Hats off to George Clooney and Ben Affleck for a job well done. The movie is gripping and very intense.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Typical Harliquin romance book.  Girl meets boy, falls in love, misunderstanding happens,they part and get back together.  Was mildly entertaining.
B008CRC506|5.0|This is one of the best TV series I've ever watched. Entertaining, smartly written and just plain enjoyable to watch!
B009G7WUME|5.0|I just happened upon this modern LP release of AM's 1996 smash and decided to pick one up on a lark. The original 1996 CD sounded great and so does this gem of a LP! I would like to meet the person who actually cut the master for it because they did a great job. It's a great example of what records can do and if you are looking for something really snazzy to play on you high end system this would be a great choice. Some of these modern pressings fall short on quality but this is definitely not one of them.
055357342X|5.0|Three kings contend for the throne and King Joffrey's wedding day grows near. Can he hold the throne with Robb Stark and Stannis Baratheon nipping at his heels?<br /><br />Yeah, that's a woefully inadequate summary but it's not laden with spoilers, either.<br /><br />Here we are, the third installment of Weddings, Beddings, and Beheadings, and my favorite one so far. In fact, I was thinking about downgrading them to 4's just so I could show how great I thought this one was. Martin outdid himself this time.<br /><br />First of all, there were quite a few deaths in this one. I wasn't expecting Robb Stark to go out like that. Tywin and Joffrey more than had it coming, however. The Red Wedding was pretty surprising, as was the trial by combat for Tyrion's fate. Speaking of Tyrion, his wedding to Sansa was also quite unexpected. I'm still not sure where things are going with Davos Seaworth but I'm already itching to find out.<br /><br />Jon Snow continued to be my favorite character, from his stint with the wildlings to his defense of the Wall to his imprisonment and eventual election to commander of the Night's Watch. The prospect of Snow becoming Lord of Winterfell is an intriguing one and I'm anxious to see how it unfolds.<br /><br />Another plotline I'm particularly enjoying is that of Arya and the Hound. The Hound could easily be a scene-chewing villain but is a surprisingly deep character. Arya is shockingly bad ass for a preteen.<br /><br />One character I'm surprised I've grown to like is Jaime Lannister. He's an arrogant unapologetic bastard and I love him for it. I'd read a whole book of Jaime's exploits.<br /><br />Also, how about Petyr Baelish? What a bastard!<br /><br />I'm giving this five stars with an exclamation point next to it. After a short break, I'll be devouring the two remaining volumes.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun resource management game.  Social with other players is built in with Neighbors Quests and such. worth the download for free.
0345535421|4.0|In the wake of King Robert's death, four men lay claim to his crown. The Mother of Dragons builds her khalazar as magic slowly returns to the world. Jon Snow braves the wilds beyond the Wall. Tyrion Lannister struggles to hold the power behind the Throne. And Winterfell harbors a viper in its midst...<br /><br />Like I said before, it's hard to write a teaser for a book this size. Look at it! You could club a narwhal to death with it if you were so inclined.<br /><br />The epic of The Song of Ice and Fire continues to unfold in the second volume. Robb Stark, the King in the North, continues his campaign to avenge his father and take the Iron Throne. His sister Sansa remains in King's Landing, still betrothed to the vile Joffrey. Arya, well, she has quite a bit going on. Jon Snow continues being my favorite character as he ventures beyond the wall, probably marking him for death sometime soon. I'm wondering if the Starks will ever be reunited.<br /><br />In non-Stark news, Tyrion Lannister continues being the best character in the series and pulls the strings behind the scenes. The conflict between Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly came to a head much earlier than I thought. Jaime Lannister is still in the clink and I'm hoping he and Robb Stark get more screen time in the next book. And Theon! What a colossal douche! Cercei Lannister has a lot more facets to her character than I originally thought.<br /><br />Much like the last book, most of the action happens near the end. I love the constant intrigue behind the scenes. The battle of Blackwater Bay was my favorite battle in the series so far.<br /><br />Since I read this without seeing season 2 of Game of Thrones, I'm looking forward to the following events being depicted on the show:<br />1. Jon Snow beyond the Wall<br />2. Tyrion's dialog with Cercei early on<br />3. the battle of Blackwater
0679731725|5.0|I love Ishiguro's writing.  The main character's restraint and propriety lead him into tragedy, what's more he is unable to even feel and acknowledge his loss.  He is also insensate to his prewar employer's sociopathy, it is rationalized as 'above his place to notice.'  This character sacrifices his own father to the proprieties.  It is a wonderful well-written story, and while the film is good, the book is better.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|If you want to just suspend belief and have a really fun read with werewolves, vampires, and souless folks, then this just might be the read for you.  I enjoyed all the books in this set.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I don't have children but consider myself a kid at heart and thought this movie was funny and had a great message.  The cast/voice selection was great for this one!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Movie had more detail on my Vizio 65&#34; TV than I remember from seeing the movie at the theater<br />On my 5.1 surround system the sounds were great<br />This was the first Have To Have 3D movie for me
B004FK24ZA|5.0|My wife and I watch this touching and funny movie every Christmas season. Everyone should own it, and even our grandchildren enjoyed it.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn long before reading Tom Sawyer, something I probably should have done in reverse. This was a good book for what it was. Much more simple, but still good.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The beginning is a little slow--I didn't get a very good sense of where the story was going through the first 10-15% of the book. But once it gets going, it's an excellent story and compelling read with an entertaining ending.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|Wish the seris would never end. The cast was good and story line made you keep watching. Tom Welling was prefit for the role.

1400069289|5.0|I'm not much of a non-fiction reader, in fact, I don't even know the last time I read a non-fiction book.  I picked this up because a co-worker said it was a good read and boy, were they right.  The book takes you through the history of how we learned that habits exist, how/where they exist, and how you can work with them.  As I read this book I could find habits, good and bad, in my life and through them, learn more about myself.<br /><br />The book takes you through some great real-life examples of habits in action and explains how the habit relates to that example.  To me, it was a lot like pulling a veil from my eyes. The concepts are easy to grasp, and the implications can be significant to your life.<br /><br />This is not a self help book.  It's more of an awareness book.  If you don't know and can't recognize your habits and the cues for those habits, then you can't do anything to break them.<br /><br />It's a great read and well worth the time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great price, great color also. Works great on my tablet and phone. No skipping or drag like some others. Would recommend this to everyone!

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I recently finished reading 50 Shades trilogy and wanted another love story.  This book was recommended by readers on Amazon and I'm glad I read it.  I liked the diary format and it was hard to put down.  For only $3.99, what a bargain!

B0055SWM08|5.0|I have Quell and Quell reflect. They are both solid puzzle games that get you just frustrated enough, but not impossible. I highly suggest this series.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great story! Very well written, great character development and witty. Her use of language and phonetic writing of the Irish made you feel like you had a brogue. Deals with disturbing issue of orphanages but love ovecomes the childhood trauma.Twist and turns keep you guessing right to the end.  I loved it.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I was really sorry when I finished it and have since spent lots of time thinking about why I became so emotionally attached to the characters. An intimate story.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Because it's an amazing album! Seriously, it's really good and you'll probably love it, if not as much as I do, still, it's worth it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Pointless plot, wimpy villain, grossly improbable action sequences, tepid sex  - what's mot to hate. This is the worst Bond film ever.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book made a believer out of me. It confirmed what I already believed. Praise God almighty. He loves us inspite of our faults.
B00358ESI4|3.0|I guess I've seen too many military movies lately and am tired of the same story over and over.  This is another typical war movie.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is a fun game.  I play this on my tablet.  I will go through all the levels and then uninstall and then reinstall and do it all over again.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This cartoon isn't your typical cartoon.  The movie is geared more to adults than to children and the ending will allow a sequel.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Since I was a kid I absolutely have loved the jurassic park series and re watching these films in blu ray has been a real treat. I cannot comment on any special features as I am a main feature type of guy. The deal I got for 25 bucks for the set I thought was great. If you like the series buy this trilogy and watch in high definition.
B003B02O14|4.0|Builds characters introducing great personalities.  His books  don't get old. Fortunately he doesn't feel his characters have to be embedded in sexual  conquests.  A good story can be told with its characters  being interesting and suspenseful...  thank you for another great read.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great stuff from an independent artist; sounds more polished than a lot of his older stuff but still great beats and lyrics
B000053VAF|5.0|I love this movie.  Every actor is marvelous at telling the tale of a descendant of CHrist being used to stop the end of the universe.  It is funny and loving. I know some people may be insulted by the story but it is told in fun and is a delight.
030758836X|3.0|but put it down to read something else, will get back to it soon, I hope.  It didn't open as well as I thought it would, but I won't dispair!

0393343405|4.0|Review by Donn G. Ziebell, Ph.D., Never kicked by a horse nor a mule, and author of the non-fiction Amazon book,\\"My Letters to a Prisoner -- I had not met.\\" Become an insider to the humor and private life of the writer's encounters and adventures home and abroad; a selection from over 100 letters written in six years. Each letter is a different and interesting story.<br /><br />Within his Amazon book the details and contents about the early history of the Roman and Greek cultures and their love for philosophical debates about ideas, beliefs and practices is fascinating. Ancient libraries were established to hold the many scrolls created during those ancient time periods.  But real live book worms threatened and destroyed some of the recorded writings. Preservation of scrolls was a constant battle which created the needed profession of scribes to keep making new copies of the writings. The geographical focal point, Alexandria, Egypt, became a melting pot by attracting Roman and Greek cultures toward the attractive Egyptian culture to meet there and cause the vying for philosophical dominance.<br /><br />The book really caught my attention by modifying and moderating my understanding the ethics of epicureanism. The author tells that the practice of Epicurus himself was to live modestly and enjoy life simply; and not promote the practice of taking life to the level of excesses which people generally rather think and do.<br /><br />Soon the author develops the interesting but not surprising clash of monotheism with pagan polytheism. He presents a dour, yet possibly true, introspection into Jewish and Christian practices and their aggression against paganism. He further charges that this fostered the historic fallout of the destruction of Alexandria's libraries and volumes of historical writings, thus destroying the enjoyed lifestyle of the ancient pagan cultures. Then he scourges the ancient early practice of Judeo Christian faith as not understandable and irrational for attaining the sought after spiritual qualities believed intended for living. Yet by de facto conclusion it established that the natural man cannot understand nor grasp the essence of the spiritual man. But in the end all of history lent its impact to making our world modern, for better or worse.r attaining the sought after spiritual qualities believed intended for living.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I realized today that I never wrote a review for this book. Shame on me, considering it is one of the best books I've ever read. So here I am, getting down to business.<br /><br />When I bought Slammed (at that time I didn't have my beloved Kindle), I had no idea about the story other than it involved Slam Poetry. From the moment I picked it up and began reading it, I couldn't put it down, nor could I think about anything else but picking it up again.<br /><br />Will & Layken. Loved the way they met. Loved their instant connection. Loved their sweetness. It seemed very real to me. Loved her traipsing into Will's house in her Darth Vader slippers, and that silly gnome!!!<br /><br />Every character in this story pulled at my heartstrings in one way or another, and as I said they had a certain realism. A next door neighbor, a grieving friend, a long lost someone in your life.<br /><br />This story made me laugh, made me cry, gave me tummy flutters, itchy goosebumps, and sometimes even made me mad! More than anything else though, it touched a piece of my heart in ways that I find it hard to express with the written word. Even now, thinking about the story brings tears to my eyes.<br /><br />So my SUCK AND SWEET<br /><br />My suck...I have none....<br /><br />My sweet...this novel, and Colleen Hoover for writing it.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I originally bought this as a gift because it was on sale for a really good price shortly after it came out. Then my husband read that it was a good show and we kept it instead. We were not disappointed! It's excellent and only got better in the following seasons. Even this season (one) is solid.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVED this story. It drew me in to the story and just kept me there. Loved Travis and Pidge, and I found their relationship to be very endearing. Can't wait to read Walking Disaster!!!<br /><br />I needed to add something. When I first started reading this book, in my head Travis was not physically the type of person that would do it for me. BUT...there was something about him that totally pulled me in, and I fell for him...hook, line, and sinker! He appeared hard, but was anything but...total softie! Every time he freaking called Abby &#34;Pidge&#34; I melted just like the wicked witch.<br /><br />Okay, I'm done now. When is Walking Disaster coming out? Oh yeah, April 2nd, and I'm all over it!

B00B0NDF26|5.0|Love the 80's-inspired pop synth, and the usual love and heartbreak lyrics I expect from T&S! &#34;Drove Me Wild&#34; and &#34;Now I'm All Messed Up&#34; are my fav tracks.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|In a narrative feature the music helps to accent the mood of the dialog or build suspense as a scene unfolds.  In Samsara there is no dialog only images gathered from around the world accompanied by music that reinforces the visual taking one on a journey that is as much inner as it is outer.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Never has a book intrigued me so much. I was enthralled from page 1 til the end. For someone with no previous exposure to zoology or animals in general, this was the best book for that!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best app I have ever encountered!I also heard that a new update comes out every 5 months!
B0094K1K42|2.0|It was kinda funny and most can relate a little but too slow and drawn out. Only if you are bored.
B008VBYN80|1.0|Lame game.<br /><br />Amazon, please oh please put clash of clans on the app store! I would even pay a dollar for it.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|A little know movie.  Helen Hunt was nominated for an Academy Award and did a supurb performance.  The story started out slow but ended as heart tugging and pleasing.  I am glad I bought the movie.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Bought this for my Dad last Christmas. Great movie!! My kids and I watch it ever Christmas too, love it!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I am starting a collection of Blu-rays for my Grandchildren, this is about one of the best.  It has action, fantasy, family problems, and togetherness, and great animation.  I can see why it won best animation at the Academy Awards it deserved it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I really enjoyed this film because of the great actors and the location shots.  It was a fairly straight forward tale of a bunch of oldies who wanted to escape dreary old England.  In the end, some found what they were looking for, and others went back to their bread pudding, but along the way, there was some well written romance, drama, and lots of gentle humor.  A feel-good film about growing old authentically.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This novel is fully of creativity. A must read especially for people with a soft spot for animals. Enjoy the book!
B0095P31L6|5.0|You could not go wrong with Johnny Depp in a movie, and now that includes animation. Rango is funny. I did not think it would be, but it is. Heroic lizard, why not? Watch it and laugh for yourself.
B0091REZMW|5.0|NEED more diamond finding items in the game so that you are able to buy food or off things that you might need in the game. That would help out a lot.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Obsessed with this show! Not too dramatic, and a great show I can watch with my boyfriend as well.  I can't wait to see how the series unfolds!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Fight club; a book, no, an artwork--that provided endless intellectual stimulation throughout the quick read. Broadened my sense of perspective; a difficult task for something as humble as a book to achieve.
1934030198|1.0|No read detailed information as he talks only in analogies and generalities.  The few detailed pieces of information that are in the book are so complicated and time consuming that it renders them virtually useless.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Exciting game for anyone who enjoys adventure games, and an escape from reality for any amount of time.  I play RPG's and adventure games primarily, and these are classics, must-haves.  A great deal for some great games.
B004VFOS2Q|5.0|Excellent film...the music will run in your head for days and days on end.  Beautifully filmed as well...you'll want to watch more than once.
B0064NTZ6W|3.0|Das Boot is technically very well-made film. The sound effects, sound editing, sound mixing, and the set design are fantastic. The atmosphere inside the submarine, the way the camera moves through real tight spaces, the camera angles all create a very realistic atmosphere. Unfortunately, I found the film was lacking a strong plot. All the aforementioned effects get tedious after 45 minutes or an hour without a plot. They run into enemy ships that drop bombs on them, they dive deeper, there is suspsense whether the submarine will take the pressure or if the damage is fatal, they divert, send torpedo and this scenario repeats throughout the movie and gets very repetitious.<br /><br />The Director's cut is 3 hours 28 minutes long. For the reasons, I mentioned above, I think this is way too long. Although there are some changes to the course events towards the middle of the movie, I still think the movie lacks a certain energy to move the plot forward. There is commentary by the director which I find very helpful. There are no other special/bonus features. The only special feature is the director's commentary; there is no behind the scenes, or the making of featurette. There is original German audio in HD-DTS 5.1 which is fantastic. There is also English HD-DTS 5.1 audio (dubbed) but I found it very bad quality; you can hardly hear the dialogues (and the subtitles are not always consistent with the spoken language).<br /><br />Overall, I think it is technically very-well made picture and definitely recommended to all world war II fans for its realistic depiction of life in a German submarine. What makes this movie special is also the fact that this is told from German perspective (there are not that many world war II movies from German perspective). And I must say the movie does a good job of showing people are just people regardless of which side they are fighting on and they are mostly victims to the circumstances of war.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The first 70% of this book was interesting but then it got beyond me and my 50's upbringing. I am no prude having raised two daughters and taught high school health to teenage girls but I have never been able to accept carnel abuse.  If it helps both daughter's read the complete series.  One somewhat rejected, the other enjoyed completely the story.
B003M98792|3.0|I purchased this Blu ray movie due to high ratings and the low price. I found out that this is actually the abbreviated version made from the scenes from the first 2 original Japanese movie, [[ASIN:B008H1Q3NW Lone Wolf & Cub Complete [Blu-ray]]] which consists of 6 movies.<br /><br />I have seen comments, by some fans, stating that this movie was made for the English-speaking audience; the comments were defensive arguments against the accusation of this movie being dubbed. I don't agree with those arguments because the scenes in this movie are exactly (I mean exactly) the same scenes from the original Japanese movie. This is not a movie shot from scratch for the English audience. I find this to be a cheap way of making money by editing the scenes from the first 2 original Japenese movie and by dubbing it in English.<br /><br />Blu-ray quality is not even that good. Ok, so it is much better than the standard version but it is not remastered; there are very visible noise that needs to be cleaned up.<br /><br />I do agree that Quentin Tarantino probably had seen the original many times and borrowed ideas for his Kill Bill saga, and nicely paid tribute to this genre.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Thus far this application seems great. It is fun to build stuff, fighting isn't bloody. Great kids game.  Taking some time to learn what to do.  If I spend money it would move along faster.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love it. The lyrics are hard core and explicit because that's the world the music came from and it's a nice change from other genres.<br />I put my MP3 on shuffle as I walk or run and when the folk or country songs end and a song from The Heist comes on, my pace quickens and the music perks me up.The instrumentation complements the rap, and each song tells a story or discusses social issues.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|i love this show glad u have it in stock to buy hope to see more of this avaible to buy
0307987698|5.0|My grandsons love the first There's a Monster At the End of This Book.  This book is a hit as well.  It's so much fun to read with them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This story was explicit and sexual! But I had a very hard time putting it down. It's fun to read about other people's bedroom adventures, great adult read
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Sometimes Mr. Martin gets carried away with descriptions, however, one does get the gist  of the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love it! I seriously couldn't put the book down. On to the author`s other books! Definitely recommend this book to anyone!
B009GJCFL8|2.0|Concert from the new material, according to the sources was filmed using multiple cameras of HD, my question that if I'm not mistaken mine is a DVD-5 with one audio only, and BTW very poor in quality in comparison to the video quality, and why compressing a HD source to a DVD-5 for an 1-1/2 hour concert with a single audio...???
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I love The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings both and was impressed by Jacksons interpretation of the story. The acting was top notch with some of the greatest actors of the time including Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen, and a reappearance from Elijah Woods. I would go about Completely comparing Lord of the Rings. The stories are both very different with their writing. The Hobbit being aimed towards children and Lord of the Rings to teens or adults. The score was wonderful and the Dwarfs songs were just as I imagined when I read the book. I would defiantly buy this edition of the story.
B000002KXO|3.0|Old songs we never hear on radio.<br />Love this group and they have so much out there, and I thought nothing would be bad coming from them.<br />Well, it's not really bad, but if I had heard it before buying, I would not buy it.<br />Still love the group of course. Very much.
0380799006|5.0|We have 3 beautiful children - 5 1/2, 4 1/2 and 2 - and sibling rivalry has been a big problem. Our middle children has a disability, so this has also added to the rivalry. Our eldest daughter had been making statements like 'You spend so much time with her'.<br /><br />I sat reading this book and was amazed how easy it is to apply the suggestions and ideas. Just by changing so of the words we use when talking to the kids and the fights have just about stopped. And by acknowledging feelings our eldest has been able to talk more freely about her sisters disability.<br /><br />And for the first week I seemed to use the statement 'Use your voice and words, not your feet and hands'. But it has worked and we have a much calmer house.<br /><br />So now I am reading one of Adele's other books - How to talk so kids will listen & listen so kids will talk. Thank you so much for writing these books.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This movie was so awful. It just really disappointed me & the boyfriend angle was boring. Not as good as the earlier films.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I like this app.  It is a little frustrating if you practice art off outside of a kindle - it is difficult to get exact lines and ideal colors.  But if you are looking for stress relief or just fun, then you will, enjoy it too.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors and I'm tickled my oldest daughter also loves her novels. I prefer paper books, but nothing beats a Kindle loaded with amazing books when you are traveling and don't want to carry the bulky dead tree editions.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I purchased this app to play with my grand-daughter at Christmas.  We had so much fun that the whole family ended up taking turns at &#34;who could be the best&#34;.
0547848412|5.0|It's a very imaginative story despite the fact that the hero spends 200 and 60 + days on a small boat with 3 wild animals or is it persons?? I read it after seeing the movie and enjoyed discovering details that were not in the movie. I loved the description of cohabitation with a Bengal tiger, a hyena, the orang outang and the injured zebra. It is dramatic survival of the fittest. A very small world where predators and victims find themselves stranded.<br />The floating island is also an interesting touch. Again we find the predators and the victims stuck together but this time there is a boat to get away.<br />This is a fairy tale for adult but I love fairy tale so I could not put it down.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I have been playing Mahjong for a long time.  Naturally, I wanted it on my new Kindle.  The one I purchased for $.99 is just way too easy.  I can run through a game in 5 or less minutes.  I think I am going to ditch this one and see if I can find something a little more complex.<br />I do, however, like the fact that when there are no more moves left, it gives you the option of shuffling the tiles to produce more.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My order was shipped earlier than expected which is a good thing as I was so anxious to get these. Love them and was very satisfied they came early!
0385528752|5.0|This book came to me recommended by my brother.  Since reading it I have recommended it to many people, one of whom bought three copies for family members for Christmas!  Does that say enough?  I have underlined, dog-eared and marked up many of the pages of my copy.  It is definitely a book I will go back to more than once.  Heavy stuff written so regular real people can read and understand it and hopefully make the necessary changes in their lives to be happy, healthy and productive people.  Highly recommended.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My order was processed and received early than expected. Which I loved this made me a wry happy customer! I will defiantly by from you guys again!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We bought this as a gift for our son-in-law after watching the HBO series.  I wish I had kept it for myself!  The actors, especially Paul Giamatti as John Adams,  really bring history and the period of the revolution, the writing of the constitution, the fight of America's independence to life.  What a human side of these historic figures we have in this series.  Having visited the same son-in-law in Boston I could visualize the places well since I had actually walked there. I would highly recommend this for a history buff or anyone interested in the struggles of our country in its beginnings.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I took my wife to see this concert (not in New York... Toronto).  It was one of the most incredible evenings of music I have ever enjoyed.  Having the recording means I can continue to enjoy old favorites and new hits whenever I want!

0425252868|5.0|In December 1943, a chivalrous act was carried out by a Luftwaffe ace. Franz Stigler took off to intercept a damaged B-17 which flew over his airfield after a mission to Bremen. It was unwittingly heading for dense flak emplacements along the Atlantic Wall, in a bid to reach the North Sea. In its already perilous state, B-17F `Ye Olde Pub' of the 379th BG from Kimbolton, would certainly not have survived the guns. Stigler, after seeing the horrendous damage sustained by aircraft and crew, experienced an epiphany. He could not bring himself to shoot down the B-17, captained by West Virginian Charlie Brown...so he escorted the bomber safely over the flak guns (they would not shoot at the Bf 109) and out over the sea. Such an act could have brought a death sentence for treason. A Higher Call focuses in detail on this fit of conscience, and the lives of both pilots in question. And it does so incredibly well. Following interviews with both combatants, author Makos spins out a riveting and emotive tale which includes Luftwaffe politics and hatred of the Nazi Party among many flyers, Stigler's early flying experiences and duty with JG 27 in Africa and Sicily, and with JV 44 - the `Outcast Squadron' (with its Me 262s flown by `Experten' such as Steinhoff, Galland, Barkhorn and Krupinski). Particularly poignant is the meeting years later of both pilots. This is an instant classic and one would struggle to find a better account of World War Two aerial combat.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy.  I have never been disappointed in his books.  Ryran family is always interesting.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|Racy and funny.  A great love story that will hit home for many people.  My first free movie on Amazon Prime.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great app love how it can be customized to suit each phone. Also word predicted works so much better than the standard app on my phone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. I did not see the ending playing out the way it did. Although the beginning of the book was pretty predictable.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have been drawn to Downton Abbey since the first episode aired.  I couldn't wait until the next chapter would be shown the next week.  I have purchased all 3 seasons and continue to look at them often.  I was very disappointed that Sybil died, and devastated when Matthew wrecked his car. It is way too soon for Matthew to die also.  I only hope there is someway to rectify that situation.  I know it is a cliff hanger and the picture looked pretty gruesome but I am hopeful that Matthew is still alive.  I was quite upset and said at the time I would never watch it again. I am waiting to see the first episode of season 4 and will then make up my mind as to whether I will continue watching it or not.  Wonderful actors, good storyline and the setting is perfect.  Overall, I think it is a great production.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|And then seeing them again in LEGO Star Wars. They go great together. I can't wait to get the rest of the collection.
B003O7I6L6|2.0|I am not interested in commenting about the story.  All I care about is the DVD transfer to Blu-ray. When I buy a Blu-ray of a previous release I expect it to be significantly better than the DVD edition. This transfer is only marginally better than the 2003 Special Edition release.  The only reason for buying the Blu-ray edition is if you don't own the 2003 Special Edition.
0670824399|5.0|I also recommend listening to the audio book on this one. The narration and voices are amazing. Great book! !
0062082353|5.0|A great American hero, my best friend (a marine) was in just about every place mr Kyle was in, so I was sort of familiar with the stories mr Kyle related. And now, he's gone, comes home to perish for no good reason and while trying to help a brother in pain..... So sad... But the book is great, for those closed minded individuals about war and the lives of our armed forces, this book puts it out there clearly enough for all to see that everyone who serves his/her country deserves nothing but our admiration and full support. God speed Chris Kyle!
0446580848|5.0|Another amazing John Corey novel, with Paul Brenner thrown in for extra adventure. Kate Mayfield has her hands full with this testosterone overload.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Like most people reviewing Peter Jackson's version of Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' I saw it at the movie theatre (my first 3D movie) and overall I enjoyed it, but was left scratching my head.<br />One, why on earth does 'The Hobbit' need to be extended into three movies, when it could have easily been accomplished in one long epic. This is especially true if Peter Jackson gave more fidelity to the original book. The opening scene  involving Gandalf and the dwarves raiding Bilbo's house could have easily been shaved in half allowing more room for this tale to be concluded in one film.<br />Two, where on middle-earth did Radagast, the Brown Wizard, come from? He sure was not mentioned in Tolkien's original version of the Hobbit and was barely mentioned in the LOTR trilogy. Although I kind of enjoyed Radagast, especially his concern for the woods and animals of Mirkwood, his inclusion was a little distracting and invites inevitable comparisons with, dare I say it, Jar-Jar Binks from Star Wars. Obviously, his inclusion was to foreshadow Sauron's return in the LOTR series ( and theatrically tie all of the movies together) but on the whole he was a distraction.<br />Three, and most grievous was the added storyline of Thorin being hunted by the white Orc. There was no such white Orc and no such story line in the original Hobbit and its inclusion in Peter Jackson's version was inexcusable and, IMO, cheapened the movie. Seriously, the cliche of the main character ( or one of the main characters) being hunted by a menacing bad guy is so overdone I would have thought Peter Jackson was above using it, especially since the original Hobbit storyline has so much action already.<br />Finally, as much as I relish the idea of three new movies involving Tolkien books, other than a blatant cash grab, I see no reason why 'The Hobbit' needs to be carved into three separate movies (part one, this one, ended about 2/3 through the book). I would rather see Peter Jackson bring his considerable talents and resources for producing epics to bear on bringing the work of other classic authors, say Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness'  or 'The Call of Cthulhu' to the screen. I always pictured the ruins of the ancient alien Antarctic city in Lovecraft's ' At the Mountains of Madness' being handled by Jackson along the lines of Skull Island in his remake of King Kong.
B008PZZFHA|2.0|It was so distasteful I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters! It would have been better off they used less&#34;F&#34; words!
1439181780|5.0|I enjoyed this book --and it has some great tips --to &#34;give&#34; and then &#34;receive&#34; the Power (of Love)!<br /><br />I am grateful to have read this book --(and that is the whole point of the book)! lol<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the book &#34;13th Octave LaHoChi: A Guide to Hands-on Techniques from a Master Healer&#34; --as a &#34;companion book&#34; to reach a 'higher dimension'...
B00371XIJE|5.0|a great relationship between two creature on earth the love and sincerity till end.not usuallyhappen when they are together but the love and relations when time came apart.

B0030V0PEW|5.0|This is a great read to convince you why a checklist works. The motto is create one to get things going!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Characters are memorable, but you need to get used to their mannerisms and dialects.  The two main characters have a lot of obstacles to overcome, however, they have fortitude and a sense of humor.  They are the kind of people that you would want for friends or neighbors because they are trustworthy and compassionate.  I would recommend this to both male and female readers, and it is not just about romance.  It's about a simpler, although not easier, time.  I think it would be suitable for high school age and up, due to adult themes and serious scenes.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Love this tv series, hope to see more episodes, but i am thinking that it might have ran it's course. I really did watch them all. Could not wait until i got the next episodes. I love Harleys!!
B008PZZV8S|3.0|Interesting to see so many stars in this movie.  Interesting but convoluted plot lines at times.  Great scenery through out the movie.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I really like this movie and it was full of action, i am thinking of renting Taken 2. I have not made up my mind, but i really enjoyed the first one.
B008X6JP3G|5.0|Great movie full of action for the guys and romance for the ladies.  Outstanding acting all the way around.  Don't miss this one.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|This was a good movie, i like the action.  I would watch this a couple of times, but mostly if i was doing a marathon of the Resident Evil. Like starting with one and going all the way to whenever they stop making them.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Brought me back to my childhood. Beautiful cinematography. Very enjoyable to watch, made me happy ! Would recommend it to anyone , any age.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This was a good movie and i would recommend it to others to watch it. I really did enjoy myself watching this movie.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I recently saw the movie for the first time, after watching a &#34;Biography&#34; show featuring Joaquin Phoenix. According to &#34;Biography&#34;, Johnny Cash really and truly admired Phoenix after seeing him in &#34;Gladiator&#34; and hand picked him for this film. It is acted superbly (and sung) by both Phoenix and Witherspoon.  It details the early life of Johnny Cash and his wife.<br /><br />Cash  had quite a few demons that he overcame.  I've always enjoyed his music, but this movie shows him as so very&#34;human&#34;, vunerable, even tortured...and a very likeable flawed human being.<br /><br />Witherspoon captured the strength of June Carter Cash.  Part of this movie details the breakup of Cash's first marriage. It was painful for his first wife to  realize he was in love with June Carter, but there just wasn't any  doubt; June was his soul mate and a source of strength for him, and they were very good for each other.  It felt like those 2 souls belonged together. I believe they were married for 35 years and he died 4 months after June.  I hope they are still together in death.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I was shocked did not even watched it, in fact, i quit watching it when they started picking up the poop that was left by a model. I  believe i was scamed, a waste of my money. I could not believe that Mark Wahlberg even participated in this film also that the girl from the 70's something show was in it. Disgusted i mean truly disgusted. In fact i am surprised you even have it up for rent, it brings horrible reputation to your awesome website. I guess, you must show all movies though.  Anyway, i wrote you all and asked if i could exchange it for another movie, never heard back from you, so i figured that was a no. Still love your website.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A typical Ryan book, Glad to see Jack Jr. is coming into his own and Dad is accepting it.<br />Look forward to seeing more of these.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Sad to see mom go, and i was kinda taken back when Bond was shot, and the fact that the girl that was in the bar got killed. The bad guy, did a awesome job at his roll, he made a good bad guy.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very good read - interesting details about anything and everything - could see mind pictures of the physical journey and could empathize with the exhausting mental and emotional journey.  This book is more about life and living than about the actual traversing of the PCT.  I laughed, I cried and I hurt with Cheryl Strayed.  Would definitely recommend this book to my friends.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat and it was one of the best movies i have seen. Excellent, i mean Excellent, it should have taken all the awards on Oscar night. I mean Ben Affleck, did an awesome job, he should be very proud of himself, and all the actors that were in this flim. I loved it!!!
B002JM1VJG|4.0|There may be a number of videos missing from the collection, but I am not disappointed in ordered it. I have Immaculate Collection and the 93-99 video collection, so when I wanted to fill in some blanks, I was happy to order the collection. The quality is about the same as the duplicates on the other collections and some are edited (prudes) but until a fully complete collection of Madonna music videos comes out, this will have to suffice, along with the others I previously mentioned.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Too much cussing and i just plain ole did not like it. I did not go that far into the movie before i turned it off, Disgusted!!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Gives a muggle the power of a wizard... when it comes to a TV. So much fun to learn how to use, train both wand and the wizard, and then use. Some frustration when learning how to use it, but what wizard didn't experience some frustration when learning spells. I only wish I knew the purpose of the green bottom... maybe it is for Slytherin House? Yeah!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I tried to get into it, it wasn't real bad, and i guess i would recommend it to others.  I don't think it out did the first one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Started viewing this on Netflix, after watching Season 1, my wife and I entusiastically looked for Season 2. Netflix did not have it; upon doing a little research I found that Amamzon had purchased all rights to Downton Abbey and soon Netflix would cease showing it. Found Season 2 on HuLu and AmazonPrime. Became a subscriber just to watch Seasons 2 & 3, although Season 3 in available on one of my cables channels. Still Amazon's Prime offers a good value so you know the rest.<br /><br />We love Downton Abbey, all the twists and turns of the story including the what goes on within the ranks of the servants. Now at Episode 5, Season 2 and can't wait to get to it each evening!
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|Good selection of songs. Great sound quality for a live album. I enjoy the longer versions of the songs. Must  have for fans.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. Not in a literary sense, but in a can't-put-it-down sense. Captivating and disturbing in all the right ways.

B0095P3ULC|4.0|i had never watched this movie and happened to start watching it with my company and found it to have great animation to it. would recommend to anyone.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|A very well-produced (scenes of the plane in distress, in particular) and acted movie.  Denzel once again shows his chops for portraying a charismatic and extremely flawed character that is believably motivated.  But the story simply began to lose my interest.  The title character, while charismatic, is not honorable and, as he devolves further into self-destruction, becomes less and less likeable, despite his charisma.  I began to not really care about his life. No other characters in the movie were interesting enough to keep me engaged (except one character who sort of disappears mid-movie).  There is some incentive to keep watching to find out if the title character will ever take the fall he deserves or if he will redeem himself, but by the end I wasn't invested enough to be moved by the impact all of his previous actions finally took on him.
B001P5VT5O|5.0|For Allman Brother fans who are trying to get \\"Shades of Two Worlds\\" and can't find it, well here it is with 4 other 1990 - 1994 releases. And the price has \\"bargain bin\\" written all over it. I've seen used copies of \\"Shades..\\" advertised for $50 plus, and here it is, NEW...FACTORY SEALED!<br />  Plus, \\"Seven Turns\\" has the late, great Allen Woody on bass, also Duanne Betts makes his debut on this album on the Warren Hayes-Dickey Betts composition \\"True Gravity\\" (a tasty instrumental). This album was a result of their 1989 - 20th Anniversary Tour, and the first Allman Brothers release after a nine year absence. (There's more!)<br />  Also included are two \\"live\\" albums, \\"An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band-First Set\\", & \\"An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band-2nd Set\\". Rounding out this compilation is \\"Where It All Begins\\" which includes the great classics \\"Soulshine\\" & \\"No One To Run With\\".<br />  Another reason for this compilation is Allen Woody plays on all five albums. This is just an amazing deal. I could write a paragragh about each album, but find out for yourself.

B00136S0NE|5.0|Simply beautiful.  It's a great movie and soundtrack.  Everyone should own a copy for their collection.  It's as pretty close to perfection as you can get.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love it. Can't wait for the next episode to begin. Joshua Jackson is excellent. Two thumbs up. Great show. Everyone should watch it
0385344228|5.0|This book reminds me of a cross between Richard North Patterson, Scott Turow and John Grisham. I love the author's style of writing this book. He takes you to the present through the dialouge at the grand jury and then takes to the past to see what lead to the arrest of Jacob. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book. It is one of my favorite legal thrillers in a long time.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It was not as good as any Jason Bourne movie....but.... I did not watch this with that comparison in mind. This does stand on it's own and i believe you can enjoyably watch this if you separate this from the first three movies.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Decent movie. A bit predictable but I would definitely recommend it as a decent movie for a night in.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this movie was it was almost too much. The problems just kept rolling in for Denzel.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|The suck level of this movie is apparent after the first five minutes. I don't have to explain why...for god sakes run away, run away fast. I would compare this film to any that Ewe Boll has made, and really might choose Ewe's. Someone one tell Anderson the cow didn't run out of milk, he just shot it, let it get hit by a semi truck, and well we are all just a little more stupid for enduring that sucky movie.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read reviews and hoped this book would meet my expectations... and it definitely did.  Few editing errors so less distraction and an easy read with an intriguing set of characters.  Will read the next book in this series soon.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|The man and his music puts on a virtuoso performance.  For those of us too young to have seen Frank live, it brings back the flavor of the Rat Pack days and Frank is still at the top of his game.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|soft and warm romance with out the feeling of underlying tension of the mystery side  of the story not as fast paced of other novels of sparks
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love these games!! I have both this one and the previous one. They're definitely addicting. The closest thing to Nintendo I've found for my fire. I'd recommend to anyone. Even for kids.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|My class read this wonderful classic and I was among the few of loving it. I think Mark Twain did a wonderful job of portraying each character.
B004132HZS|5.0|Because it came at just the way it was explained to me in the description. I was also new and never been used.

B008NEMPTO|5.0|I all ready had the Blu Ray copy, so I knew, I like the premise ( which is quite crazy, as is anything associated with Tim Burton).  The 3D copy of the movie is Outstanding.  3D enhances almost all the movie.  I found it to be in-your-face even more.  Beware of the axe, as it comes right out at you.  Is it better than the Blu Ray, yes.  3D folks want the 3D to be really worth the extra money.  So, this 3D is well worth the extra money.  This Horror/Fantasy film was really good as Blu Ray, but as 3D, it is 100% better. I have had several disappoints for 3D movies (one is I, Robot), where they have been so,so or will not play.  So, out of 5 Stars, I would rate this 3D movie a 10.  I had not really completed watching the movie, when writing the review. Now that I have finished the whole movie.  I can now say that this is the BEST 3D movie that I have purchased so far.  The reason being, this one takes the 3D at points in front of the TV, I no it sounds crazy.  This is the effect of the old time 3D's.  It happens in the Rain Scene-47 minutes; Bats Flying into scene (They appear to be about 2 feet in front of screen TV flying into scene)-58 minutes; Train Fight scene with Engine sparks flying outward-122 minutes; Also fire on trestle-continue of these scenes; and Battle of Gettysburg with silver fly out-132.  As, I said this is the best of many 3D movies I have purchased.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|greta movie for a lesson in morals, a man that could have blamed somebody else and walked away took responibilty for himself
B004I7IPL2|1.0|This was a mistake for a 3D movie, as it would not play.  I did a search and many others had problems with this 3D.  I would solidly avoid it.  I have all the upgrades, newest 3D player and Smart 3D TV.  Some people said they loaded it 20 times and it did play once.  Life is too short to be aggravated. AVOID.  If, I could have I would have gave it 0 Star.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Probably one of the best of the series.  Tight acting, good plot and a movie you think about the next day.  The extras in the DVD are good, in fact better than most.  Would have liked to see some deleted scenes.

B00755MHXG|4.0|This novel offers an amazing description of a little boy's world of pain. Few people really understand the heartaches and challenges that come with such an obvious disability.  Telling it from different perspectives gives a more dimensional view of the suffering - all the significant others also suffer - not only the disabled little boy. The author has used this multi-person narrative style to effectively enrich the story and maintain tension.  I do find the end somewhat melodramatic - not in keeping with the realistic tale of everyday struggle.  Nevertheless, for those who know this kind of heartache - and for those who don't - this novel will stay with you for a very long time.  It is enriching and will enhance your empathy for all human beings.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|Excellent app for ebay. I am using a Kindle fire hd, &amp; it works very well from browsing, to purchasing/ bidding, &amp; even making payment with paypal. Most likely you could sell just as easily, but I dont know if I would want to.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great, great movie. A classic. No matter how many times I've seen this movie I always enjoy it. The Blu-ray quality was great. Of all the times I've watched this movie this last time on Blu-ray was the best it's ever looked.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I found this book was very interesting for its about fledgling vampires and the change they go through. It's also got me hooked on the first book so I definitely will be getting the rest of the series
B003VS0CXS|3.0|The movie just wasn't as great as I remember as a child. There were parts that seemed to drag on. Don't know why, as a child, I thought this movie was so great. The Blue-ray quality was very good though.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Church feels different, politics feel different, hate, saddness, crimes all came into a precise clarity. The egos of the humans make us want to beleive this just can't be all there is to life and here comes a breath of fresh thinking. Yes I am a Christian. Yes I doubt every day too. But here in this  account of Dr. Alexander's extrodinary journey then his medical reasons why it was true, we humans begin to understand what life is all about.
B001E9641K|4.0|I am a big fan of the Ticket To Ride series of board games.  Europe and USA are my favorites.  I asked for and received Nordic Countries for Christmas 2012, however I am not sure if we will play this much at all.  A few things I have concerns on are the following:<br /><br />1. Can only play up to 3 people.  Would have been nice to make it 4 max at least.<br />2. Not as many routes/cities.  Surely they could have added some more cities and routes.<br />3. Locomotive rules are different from the Europe and USA version.  Can't use on regular routes<br />4. This loooong route Murmansk-Lieksa is an exception to the locomotive rule.<br />5. That Murmansk-Lieksa route can use \\"substitution\\" cards for the color you are playing.<br />6. On ferry routes any 3 cards can be used as a substitute for a locomotive card.<br /><br />I really hate the exceptions/substitutions listed above as a regular player of Ticket To Ride.  You try to explain these exceptions to other players who may or may not be familiar with the other versions of TTR and it ends up just being confusing.  On that looong route you can use any 4 cards (including locomotive) for any color played on that route, but on the Ferry route you can replace the required locomotive card with any 3 cards.  I would rather have some consistency here and make the exception 3 cards for both cases, or 4 cards for both cases.  It is dumb to have to remember the different exception substitution amounts.<br /><br />Why even have the Ferry Locomotive exception?  Why make that Murmansk-Lieksa route so long - 9 spots?  Isn't there some kind of tiny town between these places they could have put on the map.  Or even just a depot stop or something to break it up - then they would have had a 4 and a 5 route or any other combination.<br /><br />So they scaled the game down compared to Europe and USA, then for some reason threw in a single crazy long route and tagged \\"exceptions\\" to it.  And again for some reason decided you can't use Locomotives on regular routes, but again when you are playing a Ferry route you can replace a Locomotive with any 3 cards.  This is all crazy to me.<br /><br />I can't justify 5 stars for this version when comparing it to Europe or USA.  I have to knock it down to 4 stars.  I think there should have been more consistency between the other two main versions of TTR as well as more consistency in the use of \\"exceptions\\".
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Well this game is ok... but the thing that I don't like about it is that it keeps on freezing and shutting down!!! Please fix this! If you do, I would definantly give it 5 stars.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book, and read it pretty much non stop.<br />Not to give anything away, but the ending was right, even if I wanted a different one. I also agree with Mr King on his positions on Jack Finney book \\"Time and Again\\" as the definitive time travel story.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Surprise for a Denzel Washington movie.  He usually doesn't play this kind of role.  Great story.  Great message. Would recommend.
B0099Y2YL6|3.0|The material plus imaging is five stars. But trying to find your place or another scene is an incredibly awkward journey. One of the worst systems I have encountered.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Nice fun soundtrack! Lots of singing along by the wife! All tracks from the movie! I recommend this CD for anyone. :-)
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Just the book for military groupees with a myopic view on the world. The USA versus the Islam enemy.  Go get em, big boys.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This album was on sale for $1.99 so I figured why not, little did I know I ended up listening to it 4 times through within 24 hours of purchase... It's that good, I would have paid full price for this album and if I lost it, I would have paid for it again! Swing baby!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The first season is pretty entertaining. If anything, power through it to get to the second season when things really kick off!
1451627289|5.0|Gripping story.....amazing combination of mystery, love, terror, history, all in one book. Made me want to visit Dallas<br />and read more about the actual event, you felt like you were there. Best Steven King novel I ever read
B000VZWS6I|5.0|Absolutely stunning. I get chills every time I listen through this album. If you are a fan of Portishead or Massive Attack, this album is a must.
B00BHMF578|5.0|The movie was excellent, and the picture quality was also very good when streaming over a roku device.  I would highly recommend the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters appear as real as you or me. I just hope I'm not Thomas or O'Brien. Studying history of the time, the series seems to capture, as real as one can, the attitude and morals of the time.

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This is another wonderful Jodi Picoult thriller, very romanic with unusual ironies. I have recommended it to several friends and they have also loved it.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Actually one of the best movies I've seen in a while. The director did a great job at not making this movie seem like your typical &#34;teenage&#34; movie. Yes some scenes were brutal but not including the violence would have defeated the entire purpose of making the book into a movie. The movie did an amazing job of setting up the basis for next 3 movies. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was superb. Casting Josh Hutcherson as Peeta...ehh I was not a big fan. His acting was okay...not amazing. The majority of the cast was unknown, and I wish they had done the same when it came to casting Peeta. All in all it was a great film. Lots of action and suspense. Great!
B00006D295|5.0|Quality was awesome, no marks on disc at all. it was shipped within a reasonable time frame. Overall, i am very satisfied.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This Kindle USB cable is the best. I really love this cable for a number of reasons. Unlike the original cable/charger that came with my Kindle fire, it has a lot more length which doesn't leave me quite restricted. I also found it to charge faster than my original Kindle Fire cable. I highly recommend this cable to anyone who is looking to get a lot more out of there charging capabilities with any of the Kindle tablets. Also the price ain't bad either!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This classic movie is so much better with the beautiful blue-ray color. Arrived early and in great condition.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone.

B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is a “feel good” account of one man’s exceedingly positive impact, through his music, on an entire generation located on the other side of the globe. An impact unrealized by him until another man, believing his hero had perished in the U.S. decades ago, decided to search out his life story to share with the multitude of fans that grew up loving his music and continue listening to it to this day.
030795062X|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this is a very depressing book, but one that really touched me more than I could have imagined. Apart from the fact that I happen to be a huge Beatles fan, and so was immediately attracted to the title of the book, you have a wonderfully respected writer, a very interesting storyline, and a great setting both in time and place for a story to occur.<br /><br />This is my first Murakami book, and he did not fail to amaze and impress. It's not just the content, but the writing itself - and perhaps that has a lot to do with the translation as well, so kudos to the translator - which was absolutely mesmerizing. The descriptions, the emotions conveyed, the thoughts expressed so non-eloquently by the characters and yet very eloquently by the writer, the scenery, the simplicity of the telling of the story made it such a beautiful book to read.<br /><br />Unlike many of the other readers and reviewers of this book, I did not finish it in a day and I actually found I had to put it down a lot. Not because I would get bored, or because I didn't like it. On the contrary, it was because of the intensity of the book that I needed breaks in between to let it all sink in before I could go on reading it. It is the kind of book that you need to really submerge yourself into, and take it slowly, so you can really relish and take pleasure in this experience, as well as prolong it.<br /><br />Norwegian Wood has been likened to Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and I suppose I could understand the comparison and the resemblance between Holden Caufield and Toru Watanabe, whom the book revolves around.<br /><br />Toru Watanabe is a student in Tokyo in the year 1969 (told you it was a great year), and the book portrays his relationship with Naoko - his dead best friend's girlfriend - Midori, Reiko, Nagasawa, Hatsumi and even Storm Trooper. The book opens with an adult Toru, having heard the song Norwegian Wood, going back in years to recall the events of that fateful time of his life where all these people meant one thing or another to him.<br /><br />Murakami manages to catch your attention from the beginning, and only succeeds in holding it for the entirety of the book. Seemingly a love story of sorts, the book deals with so much more than just that, not shying from putting on display very deep emotional, human aspects for everyone to see. From loneliness, to friendship, to loss, death, impotence, adolescence, sex, humour and most importantly, hope - the book encompasses all of that and so much more. It is very real, and deals with very serious issues, one major running theme being suicide and death at a young age.<br /><br />I will say this though, as depressing as this book is, it does try to inspire hope and positivity and moving on. One of the things I really loved is the symbolism involved where the characters are concerned. Naoko symbolizing death and impotency and tragedy is a complete contrast to Midori who symbolizes life and sex and hope and resilience, and we sit throughout the novel wondering whether Toru is going to choose life or death.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough, and I could go on analysing every aspect of it for days, and every reader comes out with their own perception and interpretation of it. This is a remarkable book, and should be put on everyone's must-read lists, in fact I completely agree with all those who said that Murakami really must rank among the world's greatest living novelists. It won't be my last for him, that's for sure.at fateful time of his life where all these people meant one thing or another to him.<br /><br />Murakami manages to catch your attention from the beginning, and only succeeds in holding it for the entirety of the book.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Every Daniel Craig Bond movie is awesome - dark, filled with action and twists.  I am old enough to appreciate hurting with I do stupid $#!@t - so I felt for him in this one (and \\"M\\").  Liked the strings to old, old Bond movies and the last sequence was worth the coin.  GREAT ADDITION to any collection that enjoys action plots and good story.  Just hope they keep Craig in the fold for a few more.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I distinctly recall wanting a GAEMS unit back in 2011 when it first launched. I was in awe of the ability to easily carry around not just your device, but an entire setup that would require nothing more than a power outlet to just start enjoying your favorite games. But I could never justify the cost of one, thinking to myself that I just didn't travel enough to warrant purchasing one for no other reason than the cool factor.<br /><br />Well, I luckily got a nice chunk of change back from my taxes this year and being only partially irresponsible with my return, I remembered this little piece of hardware and took the plunge. I was debating between the Vanguard unit and the G155, but wound up with the G155 in the end because I couldn't justify paying almost twice as much for something I wouldn't use on a regular basis.<br /><br />Got home, set it up and I am in love with this thing. This will definitely be going with me whenever I do any sort of traveling (road trip, train ride, or flying anywhere...even the occasional trip to work). I usually miss having my console with me and this will alleviate that immensely. No more relying on handhelds or my iPhone to satisfy my gaming fix.<br /><br />Of course, the warnings are everywhere about how this only works with the Xbox 360 (any version) or the PS3 Slim only. I do admit that I have a fatbody PS3 (it works just fine and I've never had the need for a greater capacity HDD), so I regret not being able to take PS3 exclusives on the road with me, but I do most of my gaming on the 360 anyway.<br /><br />The viewing angle can be a buzzkill for some people, but this is mobile gaming, not a home theater experience. That said, I'm really impressed with the sound that this device puts out and the picture is nice and crisp. At a monitor this size, 720p is plenty and there's no need to go any higher.<br /><br />The sidebags hold everything nicely and although I was first concerned about the HDMI cable being so short, it's a perfect size given the layout of the monitor and how the console fits (which is like a glove, I might add). The case is very rugged and protects the console well.<br /><br />If there is anything I would say about this, it's that there's no game storage available, which forces the need to either carry an additional bag for your games (if you like to leave them in their case) or take your games and put them in a CD booklet. I like to leave my games in their case (I can't stand seeing games in incorrect cases), so this would be only slightly problematic for me. But if there was built in storage for games (say, a zippered sleeve that tucked away in the case somehow), I'd forego the cases and use that instead.<br /><br />Part of me also wishes that a remote control was included (once again, nothing fancy, just a small remote with five buttons to mimic the buttons on the monitor itself). When I was playing, I sat just outside of arm's reach from the monitor and found myself wishing that I either had a remote control (not necessarily wireless) or that there was a set of buttons near the front of the case to control volume (I got to thinking about it and if there was a control panel built into the case, I'd only want volume as I wouldn't want to be accidentally powering off the monitor and the brightness control isn't a necessity and would just cause confusion as to which set of buttons was which...so two simple buttons, one with a plus sign and one with a minus sign, for volume control would be perfect).<br /><br />Are my two beefs enough to warrant anything other than a 5 star rating? Hardly. This device is well worth the money spent. And the fact that I can leave my 360 in its case and still hook it up to my home theater if needed is just gravy on the mashed potatoes.<br /><br />(My coworkers got jealous when they found out I got one of these.)

B009NQKPUW|3.0|PROMETHEUS is a prequel to the first ALIEN movie from 1979..  The special effects are very good, however there was not enough scenes with the aliens in the movie and the whole storyline about trying to find the &#34;ENGINEERS&#34; who created the human race was far-fetched and not very believable..<br /><br />If you are a fan of the ALIENS movies though, I would recommend renting this movie..<br /><br />3 out 5 stars..

His name in the movie is William Miller, and he goes on tour with the band STILL WATER in 1973 and writes a story about them that ends on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine...<br /><br />Great story, great acting and TOTALLY AWESOME MUSIC make this a must see for anyone who loves classic rock..<br /><br />5 out 5 stars.
B00156VGX8|1.0|I watched this movie using my HD Vizio TV's built in wifi and the quality was very poor.  I know the poor quality is not TV related as I have no problem streaming Netflix movies both HD and non-HD.  This movie is not HD and the streaming hesitates every few frames.  I tolerated this for as long as I could and finally gave up as the movie was not engaging to me.<br /><br />This movie starts from the closing credit and plays segments backwards.  You follow the story line from the end to the beginning.  This is too much work for me as I watch movie to be entertained and do not feel this movie did the job.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie is GREAT..  Kristen Stewart is awesome as Snow White, and Charline Theron is absolutely frightening as the Evil Queen, Ravena..

B00AOCZOLO|5.0|So glad they ditched wayens after the pilot. Lamorne Morris is PERFECT, wouldnt be the same show if wayens had stayed. I watched it from the start cause Zooey is my top 3 hotties. She fits that part fantasticly, and is ADORABLE. IMO Shmidt is the best and most complex character in TV, he almost makes the show. I have played the first season at least 4 times. Best episode are &#34;THE WEDDING Zoey looking fantastic and the CHRISTMAS&#34; ep and &#34;THE 50&#34;. This season 2 has been just as great esp &#34;THE MENZIES&#34; only horrible part is they gave the HORRIBLA Olivia Munn 2 eps and maybe more. She is a show killer. Not funny, NOT an actress, she should stick to the G4 networt and be a video game nerd. Dark times when she is on the show. Had little intrest in watchng the 2 eps she was in.<br />ruined the 2 shows she was in. So annoying. , Want Shmidt and cece back together. You just want to give Jess a big 'ol hug she is so adorable. And Winstons scream, and afraid of the dark.I know these are from the first season except for the &#34;menzies&#34; Narrow miss, amanda bynes was up for the role of jess. wouldnt work.. Zooey was born for that role. Wish they would do blu rays for the seasons. LASTLY I think its in my top 3 show all time. Perfect show, sure there are a few flat eps, but thats to be expected Sorry I had limited reviews of season 2, it just a great show.<br />Shane

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed these books. I am a fan of them. The richness of character and the diversity of Mr. Martin's world are aspects I greatly enjoyed. When I say diversity I mean in fleshed out religious plurality, ethnic, racial, etc. It mirrors much of, for myself, what I love about our own world. However, I must say, Mr. Martin's lens of reality is very nihilistic. That, within each of these aspects of diversity and even within the particular lives of the characters-Meaning is punished. Most of all the reflections of the diversity are either the bad (rape, murder, blood lust) or tragic-tragic in the sense that honor, fidelity, love etc. are seen as anachronistic, in some parts. For the most part, though, the best of our Human traditions are shown to be foolish and punished terribly-any form of belief is shown by the 'fates' in this world to be worthless, practiced by fools, honorable fools but fools nonetheless.<br /><br />I would recommend this series for anyone that is stronger in or has experienced the opposite of the truth that Mr. Martin is portraying. For these particular people I think it can be a dark but fun jaunt through a bitter world we are glad is not totally reflected in our own. Yes, all of the horror occurs here but despite it seemingly endless and continuous we see love, fidelity, and honor arise. Not in the abundance of its other, and yet, as I have seen it, if not in equal quantity it is its match in strength.<br /><br />Fun read....for particular people

So... it works and you can write and it turns it to texts but it doesn't have as many mathematical operations as one might have hoped so if you are an engineer well perhaps you might need additional features. If u are just looking to calculate a tip than... get it because it gets the job done.

B0087YP862|2.0|Abraham Lincoln was not only the Sixteenth President of the United States of America. According to some, he was also a Vampire Slayer of no mean order. If so, his services are required. Resurrect him at once! An adversary worthy of his mettle is at hand.<br /><br />No, I am not referring to the usual Period Practice Nosferatus - the likes of Jeggy, Rene Jacobs, Pale Bill Christie, Corporal Hogwood and what not: Abe - don't waste your Holy Water on these lightweights. No, a genuine Vamp lurks in the twilight of the recording studio: Count Claudio Abbado the Impaler.<br /><br />The former chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic gave the game away in his recent recording of Fidelio. Check out the cover ([[ASIN:B004OCCFFI Beethoven: Fidelio]]). That's a vamp! His fangs are semi-visible too. Add a cape and Abbado could walk imperiously onto the set of Twilight with Kirstin Stewart in train.<br /><br />Athirst for sanguinary feasts, Abbado loves nothing more than to sing his fangs into Mozart and suck him dry until he is a pale and anaemic imitation of the composer whom we all adore. Under his tutelage, the so-called Orchestra Mozart is transformed from a dog-ordinary HIPster ensemble into a dog-ordinary chamber-orchestra playing at modern-day pitch (listen to their barnyard yapping at 1'09\\", 1'19\\" and 1'28\\" in the prelude of K 595 - the strings are also regularly monstered by the flautist and the phrasing at 2'37\\" in the first movement is hideous). Even if she is no Gilels, Pires is as musical as ever (she does not use a lot of pedal) but the innate vitality of these scores is drained away by the nefarious figure on the podium and his vassals. The recording is crystal clear enough albeit a tad recessed  - which renders the bloodletting even more gruesome.<br /><br />How putrid this is: it's an update of Mozart as a Dresden China figurine which has been drained of its blood. H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Grimaud refused to perform any more Mozart Piano Concertos with Abbado. I would like to think that the fiery French pianist had had enough of his Pale Rider ways.<br /><br />Four stars for Pires, one star for Count Claudio Abbado the Impaler and his \\"Orchestra Mozart\\".<br /><br />Abe - sharpen up that crucifix!o think that the fiery French pianist had had enough of his Pale Rider ways.<br /><br />Four stars for Pires, one star for Count Claudio Abbado the Impaler and his \\"Orchestra Mozart\\".<br /><br />Abe - sharpen up that crucifix!

B001GCUO5M|5.0|This is seriously one of the coolest movies i have ever seen. I absolutely love it. However, when it was delivered, it was in a cardboard envelope with little protection for the movie, and the plastic on the dvd case itself was slightly warped and wrinkled like it had been wet

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This series just reels you in like helpless fish and just wont let up! They really flesh out the characters and the story lines have me salivating for more! This can only mean one thing...They're going to discontinue the series, as what happens to all quality programs on television. Please oh please! prove me wrong!!

B0097AQEOK|2.0|While enough can not be said about the excellent quality of her first four Reprise lps, she became increasingly less melodic but more abstract, self absorbed, pseudo-serious (\\"I am a black male jazz artist\\"...yeah yeah trapped in a white folkie female body...) and, worst of all, tediously boring with each subsequent release. At least this set does not include the worst Standards album ever made which she waxed in the early 00s.

B00A2LOAKI|5.0|First of all, this is the conclusion of a two parter.  It was necessary.  The original story is from the Eighties and basically took the Batman from the camp to the Dark Knight.  This is an older version of Chris Nolan's view.  More reviewers will tell the story.  I was watching the style.  It is the style that Miller made the story in.  The DCU animation group are the best.  Miller also wrote Sin City and worked with Rodriguez for the movie.  His touch shines in both movies.  The older, chunkier Batman who has to use his mind as much as his body and realizes he can no longer do this on his own is an effective character.  There is also a secondary Canon that was formed by this novel,  which involves Superman and Green Arrow.  Remnants of this was used when they later killed off Oliver Queen and even later brought him back.  The true weakness of Superman is shown, (not Kryptonite or magic) but a personality flaw.  All in all a good and thought provoking episode.
B0045XICB2|5.0|What can I Say. All of the Twighlight Series Movies are incredible. I would recommend this to all who have not seen this.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|Nearly twenty-five years later, I still listen to composer Danny Elfman's brooding orchestral score.  It conjures up an image of actor Michael Keaton's Batman standing victorious atop a Gotham City skyscraper, as the new Bat-signal cuts through the night fog.  As soundtracks typically do, I was recently inspired to re-watch 1989's No. 1 summer blockbuster.  It is easy to see why it blew past a slew of routine sequels such as \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade;\\" \\"Ghostbusters II,\\" \\"Lethal Weapon 2,\\" \\"Licence to Kill,\\" \\"Star Trek V,\\" among other competition.  It wasn't just the hype - sure, there was its mind-boggling marketing campaign (for its time) hawking every form of bat-merchandise imaginable (today, that's the norm).  What really stoked moviegoers, I think, was its sheer originality - like lightning in a bottle that even its own three sequels couldn't re-capture.<br /><br />The movie's trademark, for better or worse, is Jack Nicholson's wily over-acting as the nefarious mobster Jack Napier turned macabre super-villain, the Joker.  Although Nicholson was frankly far too old to be a legitimate physical threat to Batman, his sheer flamboyance overcomes this flaw.  I still believe either Willem Dafoe or Ray Liotta (who was screenwriter Sam Hamm's preference) would have been just as effective in the role if the movie hadn't been designed as a Nicholson showcase.  Even so, courtesy of a few well-designed flashbacks, director Tim Burton and screenwriter Sam Hamm cleverly side-step Batman's well-known origin by instead providing a mystery so viewers can deduce why a reclusive, strangely distracted billionaire has assumed a caped alter ego.  The film opts not to show how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman since the psychological \\"why Bruce Wayne is Batman\\" factor proves far more interesting.  Make no mistake: actor Michael Keaton doesn't look like Bruce Wayne, but, in this movie, he is Bruce Wayne ... a disturbed Bruce Wayne who walks, trance-like, through a hail of gunfire upon recognizing a face he once saw long ago.  He is then left to ponder the Joker's favorite taunt to his doomed prey: \\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\\"  Not surprisingly, the Joker's dance with a captive Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) plays against the backdrop of a pale moon on a dark Gotham night setting up a final showdown between two comic book legends.<br /><br />Late production designer Anton Furst's dark art deco, 1940's vision of Gotham City brilliantly resurrects film noir.  Impressively, even though \\"Batman\\" was filmed almost entirely on British soundstages, Furst's sets are amazing enough to make a viewer almost believe that Gotham City really does exist.  There is no mistaking that, based upon the villains' retro wardrobe alone, that this Gotham City is supposed to be reminiscent of Prohibition-era Chicago (think \\"Batman Meets the Untouchables\\"). Wisely, the stellar \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" subsequently lifted Furst's distinctive style giving Batman a new sense of visual continuity, as Gotham City appears as the dark, corrupt cesspool of a modern city it is supposed to be.<br /><br />If one can swallow a middle-aged Nicholson as the Joker and Keaton's quietly neurotic Bruce Wayne / Batman, then everything else about this movie falls into place.  Yes, Kim Basinger's glamorous Vicky Vale is a Lois Lane wanna-be and a helpless damsel-in-distress where she must be startled at every turn (not remotely believable for a war zone-savvy photo-journalist).  Still, Basinger's charismatic presence nicely balances the lead actors.  My only criticism comes from the Joker's less-than-satisfying yet unique fate (one is left incredulously thinking: \\"That's the best they could do?\\").  It is similar to the predicament that \\"Star Trek Generations\\" had in 1994 with William Shatner's iconic Captain Kirk: there were countless better solutions available than the one filmed for the theatrical release.  Please also note that not all the acting honors belong solely to Nicholson and Keaton.  They receive ample support from the late Michael Gough (as Alfred); the late Pat Hingle (as Commissioner Gordon); and even Robert Wuhl's new character, wisecracking reporter Alexander Knox.  Knox isn't necessary to the story, but Wuhl has solid chemistry with Basinger.  Deleting Knox in favor of making wimpy Vicky Vale far stronger, as in closer to Selina \\"Catwoman\\" Kyle's equal, would have likely would have increased the movie's mass appeal for female viewers.<br /><br />As for the special effects, they mostly hold up well, particularly the awe-inspiring Batmobile and a surprisingly realistic rubber Batsuit.  Even though the Batplane model's aerial shots look terribly fake today, it is pretty clear that all the FX money spent on this fifty-million dollar mega-production appears on-screen.<br /><br />Finally, with its original interpretation of the title character vs. one villain fighting for the soul of Gotham City, \\"Batman\\" 1989 is simply far superior to its three sequels that imitated but could not duplicate the first movie's success.<br /><br />Overall: 9/10 stars.  Despite its weaknesses, this \\"Batman\\" is well worth repeat viewings.  The DVD extras (including multiple documentaries and three Prince music videos) are superb, but I might add that the Prince videos are not appropriate for young viewers.elong solely to Nicholson and Keaton.

B008UFUOH6|4.0|I loved some of the songs on the disc, but others I did not like much.  Over all, I thought her selection only fair.  Since that's a subjective thing, and I really like her voice, I'm still glad I got the disc.  Also I love Christmas music, and collect unusual discs.
B004WDX5P8|2.0|This movie is... Interesting. It doesn't really hold you interest, it was a little boring because he's just... Buried! The ending was the worst ending you could ever image. What was even the point of this movie? I wouldn't recommend this.

B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter is one of my favorite shows. my only complaint is with HBO they ruined the finale for me before I even started the season so be careful watching the previews if you have an eye for picking things up it can ruin the finale for you unless they have changed it.
B00AFOS6QG|4.0|14th studio album from this legendary Australian musician, one of the few true artists of our time.<br />  Much like Leonard Cohen, if Cave is an artist you have discovered, he will always be close to<br />  your soul (though sometimes on the dark side), because he has something to say and he knows<br />  how to say it so that it matters.  \\"Push the Sky Away\\" is not his best album or his worst.  It rings<br />  true with the power of the band's artistic integrity and, as usual, that is enough to satisfy, enough<br />  to make most other releases pale in comparison.  The songs lean toward the mellow, gentler<br />  gospel/folk side; but Cave's crooning, intensely personal & dramatic vocal delivery crawls<br />  through his dark, poetic lyrical imagery with vehement, loving passion and a riveting interpretive<br />  flair.  The Bad Seeds are veteran players who believe in and understand his ability, and their<br />  instrumental contribution is both essential and subtly spectacular.  His albums always grow on<br />  you, and this is no exception.  Members have played in Grinderman, Dirty Three, the Triffids,<br />  Magazine, Buzzcocks, Visage, etc.  Expect to fall slowly, irreversibly in love with the depth and<br />  purity that lies waiting here.
0375869026|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an elementary school librarian as being one which no child of about 10 years or any adult should miss.  She was so right!  Every word was perfect!  The book is about Auggie Pullman, 10 years old, who was born with an extremely rare combination of genetic abnormalities which result in his face being seriously deformed.  Having been home schooled thus far, Auggie's parents decide to enroll him in a private school in Manhattan for the fifth grade. &#34;Wonder&#34; chronicles this one year from his own point of view and then those of his sister, Via, and some of his classmates. Every word from each narrator rings absolutely true as we experience the pains and successes of Auggie's school year.  Auggie, blessed with a loving, supportive family, and with valiant strength of his own, a sense of humor, and without a scintilla of self pity, emerges triumphant.  We weep, we laugh, we cheer as we accompany Auggie through this transformative year.

1592407889|5.0|Considering Sachi's ability to go along with everything with so little protest (her Japanese upbringing), it is amazing that she finally came out and called a \\"spade\\" a spade when she told her mother that the man she feared and loved all her life was a con artist.<br /><br />What is sad is that she had such a need for love, that even after realizing what an evil person her father was she still clung to the hope he might show her some fatherly warmth.<br /><br />The father is definitely the most despicable human being on the earth. Sachi is definitely kind to her mother in her book, and although Shirley Mclaine comes across as irresponsible and selfish, Sachi actually shows her great compassion by realizing that all her mother's beliefs may have simply stemmed from her great need to escape life's daily drudge. It might make an interesting book why Sachi's mother had such a great need to escape emotionally; maybe she didn't have such a savory childhood either.<br /><br />Sachi does come across as a hero. It is amazing that she survived, and that her basic goodness remained intact and that she bore no real malice; just sorrow. She certainly has a right to her anger. She was robbed of a childhood.<br /><br />If her mother has one tenth of the humanity of the characters she plays, she will see the book for what it is and appreciate her courageous daughter and be drawn closer to her daughter.<br /><br />Because what you have with your children and loved ones, that's all that there is, in any lifetime.

If you are looking for a good scary movie (I haven't seen one this creepy in a long time), take a chance and watch Sinister!

B00821OX98|5.0|It amazes me how few sci-fi shows are being made these days.  Falling skies is a very well produced show about an alien invasion of earth.  It takes place in what is left of the Boston suburbs, with a small group of survivors known as the second mass.  The first season primarily deals with man's struggle against a seemingly unbeatable opponent.it has a great deal of suspense, excellent special effects, and a very addicting plot.  Definitely a must watch for sci-fi fans.

B00886XQO0|3.0|**** Update 3/19/13 *****<br /><br />After receiving a comment on my review I did double check the USB port on the Xbox and<br />it does stay powered on after the xbox is turned off. I must not have had something plugged in correctly because it didn't charge one night.  So I would say my item #6 is a non-issue.<br /><br />**** End 3/19/13 Update  *******<br /><br />This product is kind of hard to review.  First I guess it does everything it said it does and it has plenty of features and settings, but the usability is somewhat disappointing. I gave it 3 stars because it should function a little better for the price.<br /><br />1) Sound level isn't loud enough.  I'm sure you could play with the manual configuration you can get it louder, but you should be able to crank it up out of the box with any of the presets.  The fact is however that you almost have to turn it up all the way to even hear it.<br /><br />2) Sound seems to change each time it's turned on.  After modifying settings on the game and on the headset to get it loud enough to hear, the next time you turn it on you can barely hear it at the max setting. I know it sounds hard too believable but it's happened more than once and it's totally annoying.<br /><br />3) I'm a full grown man and headset is still too large. The cups barely fit my ears even at the smallest setting.  I'm just not sure who they were trying to fit with this thing.<br /><br />4) Voice chat has a really problem being heard over game sounds.  With both voice and game (see #1) turned to max, it's still hard to hear chat.  It is better at some settings but if both volume controls had about double the range it would be much easier too adjust.<br /><br />5) Too many buttons and everything but the two volume controls are flush mount.  All the features and adjustments are nice but with a button at almost every location (and flush with the set), it's hard to reach up and press the right button or even find a button.  The buttons should stand outsome from the headset.<br /><br />6) Since you can't change the battery, you have to charge it from a USB.  Several devices (including  the xbox and pc's) shut their usb down when they turn off.  This requires you to have an AC2USB adapter to charge the headset (about 6 hours) not included.  For this price they should have included one or either have designed the transmitter/receiver with an always on usb.  This is not a show stopper but since one of the the selling point is \\"totally wireless\\" it's not fun to have to charge the headset until you figure this out.<br /><br />7) No rhyme or reason to when blue tooth powers on or off.  Sometimes when you turn the device on the blue tooth (needed) for chat comes on, sometimes it doesn't.  Same thing for turning the device off, sometimes the blue tooth turns off sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />This is a long review to say that I've used Turtle Beach's for a long time, and the sound and fit on the X3's were better IMHO. There are plenty of controls, setting and adjustments, but it requires a lot of playing with to be useful. These do have the wireless chat feature which is nice, but because of the functionally and price I'm just not sure it's worth it.  I'm really thinking about passing these on to my kids and getting the Tritton Warhead's, if I do I'll update this with a comparison of the two.

B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Wow, not at all what I expected from the preview. Let me begin by saying that this movie's biggest problem is the soundtrack; the 80's pop-synth songs are completely incompatible with this movie. Then, a moody jazz tune is randomly thrown into the mix late in the movie. WTH? The second biggest problem is the lack of action. For a movie called &#34;Drive&#34; I expected at least one inventive car chase. There are two short car chases, if you want to call them that, and they simply don't deliver. Third, Gosling's character simply isn't explored, which is a huge problem considering that his and Mulligan's character have zero chemistry. Muted, supposedly longing gazes at each other, don't make for acting here, or anywhere for that matter. Finally, why is Christina Hendricks even listed in the credits? She's in the movie for about 5 minutes, a complete waste of her talent. If there is anything good about this movie, it's Albert Brooks, but he's under utilized in light of Ron Perlman. I simply cannot recommend this movie.

B001BKV9TE|1.0|Bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, ridiculous...give me a moment while I break out a thesaurus! Just about everything that can be done wrong here is, except for maybe the CGI killer ostriches, which simply do not make sense anyway as they appear in the middle of a bamboo forest. Oooookay. Prepare to suspend ALOT of disbelief as the stilted dialogue (spoken in perfectly stilted English) drags us through a plot device we’ve seen 10,000 times before. Worse, this movie rips off everything from Last of the Mohicans to Rambo to Braveheart to Stargate (yes, even Stargate) and not in a remotely clever way. But, hey, they're cave people, right? What do they know about film making? The only thing that kept me awake through this epic disaster was to see if it could get any worse. It did, right ‘til the very end. If these were my ancestors, like a Bible literalist  I'd be arguing that modern human beings popped out of thin air, too!

B007FXLZ9K|2.0|&#34;Shame&#34; attempts to be one of those arty movies in which long blank stares are a replacement for acting. Fassbender's character does 'wake up' towards the end of the movie in that respect but it's too little too late. We never understand what makes Brandon tick and no amount of gazing helps us learn anything about him. The metaphorical white walls of his apartment sure aren't any help; it says virtually nothing important about the character though we're to assume it does. [Note to the director: We've already been exposed to this cinematic trick, several times.] The movie is unnecessarily long too; Carey Mulligan's little song, for example, did absolutely nothing to advance the razor thin plot. Nor is the nudity central to the plot. This movie is also devoid of incidental music, which supposedly makes this story more realistic. Yes, well, sometimes real life is not always more entertaining than fiction. This one's a snoozer.
B000FC1AGG|3.0|Sophie Kinsella is the perfect weekend read. Fun characters trying to deal with work, life and romance. Always a fun read.
B004EI2NM2|3.0|This movie has a little something for everyone: For men, you've got two women (one attractive, one 'meh') who are naked 95% of the movie; for women, the two naked women talk for 95% of the movie; and for the androgynous artsy-types, they'll view all that talking as a meditation on the value of the truth in relationships. Only, all the lying isn't pulled off with quite the same panache as it is in, say, The Usual Suspects (you'll see what I mean if you watch this). This is exactly the kind of movie you want to give five star but just can't if you enjoy movies with a discernible plot. There is none, which is made even less enjoyable when there are only two characters in the whole movie to deal with. At least the sex-scenes were passionate, hence the three stars.
B00000JGHM|5.0|HEAT made a big splash in 1995 and there was a lot of controversy about the amount of violence in the film. Now 17 years later the film still remains a strong hallmark of cops and robbers genre films but the violence pales in comparison to what we are exposed to at present. Michael Mann who both wrote and directed this suspenseful thriller went on to direct and produce such films as Public Enemies, Miami Vice, Collateral, Ali, The Insider, Texas Killing Fields, Hancock and The Kingdom  and he hasn't lost his touch with action cinema. Another entertaining aspect of looking at these big films of the past is seeing the beginnings of  the careers of some young actors and observing the work of the solid character actors at their prime.<br /><br />One summary of the plot that briefly lays out the story follows: Neil McCauley is a thief... an expert thief... one of the best. His philosophy in life - become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you spot the \\"Heat\\" around the corner. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of Detective Vincent Hanna. But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime, and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.<br /><br />The superb cast includes Robert DeNiro as McCauley and Al Pacino as Hanna and the multiple supporting roles are filled by the likes of Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Kevin Gage, Hank Azaria and Jeremy Piven. The cinematography and special effects are ahead of their time and the movie plunges the viewer into the underbelly of Los Angeles like few other films have been able to match. It is still a viable contender for one of the `famous cops and robbers' films.  Grady Harp, February 13other films have been able to match.

B005OT2YVA|2.0|I wanted to like this movie but there were too many problems. I will say the action and CGI are top-notch, but it does take a while to get around to it and the final battle in particular goes so on so long you just want it to stop. The plot is somewhat clever and there's a good twist or two gien the premise of a robot smash-em-up flick, but that fact is trumped by other factors.The movie's biggest problem is that it tries to be more of a comedy than anything else, which does not work if 30 seconds prior to a joke you're filming people being literally obliterated by Decepticons. There's no fine-line being walked by Michael Bay there. Too much time is also wasted on Sam's relationship with his girlfriend who you wish would just stop talking and be the window dressing she's supposed to be. That said, the development of other characters is almost completely absent, whether we're talking about humans or transformers. This could have been a decent movie, but thanks to Bay's bombastic tendencies while trying to play cutesy, it actually winds up underwhelming us.

B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Given this movie's pedigree, a potentially great cast on hand, and updated SFX, you figure, &#34;What could go wrong?&#34; The answer, of course, is nearly everything. Let's begin with this movie's biggest flaw; it doesn't know whether it wants to be a remake of Arnold's movie, or if it wants to take the original concept and make it it's own. On both accounts this movie fails as it fatally reworks key plot devices that made the original movie great. Nor does it really give much thought to the book's, &#34;Is this a dream or not?&#34; premise. The driving force behind this movie is action which is standard movie schlock for the most part. Only the car chase scene is remotely clever and that is disappointing; you'd think that given the opportunity to have Beckinsale and Beil fight, something better should have been produced for their scene if nothing else. Speaking of the star power, there is very little chemistry between any of the players. Cranston, for example, as the villainous Cohaagen was reminiscent of what happens to soda when you leave the cap off too long and Nighy's Matthias hardly figures into the plot at all. While this version of Total Recall does look slicker than Arnold's movie, that is no saving grace. Still, I gave this movie two stars for the few sly nods to the original movie it does make.

0786958731|5.0|This is a great game for beginners or those looking for DnD fun without having to prepare a game session. It plays like 4th edition lite and most adventures can be played in under 2 hours once you get the hang of the rules and setup. I also have the Castle Ravenloft game set which is a good purchase as well and Wrath of Ashardalon is currently in transit to me. Just keep in mind this is mostly a combat and trap oriented game. There is little to no role playing involved. Most Dungeons and Dragons style board games are similar in this respect.<br /><br />Newcomers to Dungeons and Dragons may be a little confused by the rules at first, but they are not so numerous as to be impossible to figure out. Setup for people not used to table top gaming or more involved board games may be a little intimidating, but if you are patient then you will get the hang of it.<br /><br />As someone who also plays table top Dungeons and Dragons, the value in the miniatures from this box set alone is worth the price (It comes with 42 minis including 4 large and one huge). If you have ever tried purchasing minis you know that they cost way more than $1 apiece unless you find deals on ebay or craigslist that don't require high shipping prices.  The minis are unpainted true, but they are durable and can easily be painted if you desire. The minis of all of these games provide a decent mix of bad guys and heroes for regular Dungeons and Dragons as well as the game.<br /><br />I especially like this game more than Castle Ravenloft because you get to play Drizzt and friends. Its compatibility with the other box sets also means you can take Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruenor and the others through adventures outside of the Underdark.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game to DnD fans and Drizzt fans as well as people who want to start playing Dungeons and Dragons type games.

B0040HO01Y|5.0|A co-worker of mine receommended this series and I have gotten hooked on the series. It is well-acted and very pleasing visually. There are many modern themes (spousal abuse, women in politics, etc.) at a time when many changes were taking place rapidly (new communication methods, mechanization). A very entertaining series that is quite addictive. However, if you are looking for explosions and action themes, this is definately not for you.

1250007208|2.0|Did not finish<br />Stopped at page 57, chapter 8<br />  The beginning didn't grab me like I wanted. I can't put my finger on it exactly because it immediately shows us something unique about the world of cyborgs with Cinder taking off her foot. I put it down after four pages, and wandered around the house. But since I had read SO many good reviews about it, and it was voted by over half of the votes of what I should read next, I decided I would try to get through a few more chapters.<br />  When we met the prince though, and the first talk about the draft and the plague was mentioned, I got into it a little bit more. But ultimately, I still didn't want to pick it back up  when I stopped, and although Cinder was brave and talented, a character that I would normally adore, I just felt indifferent about what happened.

Siouxsie and the Banshees are an unbelievably great and rather important band and Siouxsie Sioux in particular she just has this unreal presence, her voice, her lyrics. She's long been a favorite of mine and as the years have gone by she still towers above the fold. Painted Bird, Pulled to Pieces, Spellbound, Israel, Cities in Dust....so many examples I could site. Look, listen and learn. Poke the hive and see what comes out for yourself. You'll get stung but you wont regret it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The only thing I knew about the book was the movie.  This was a great read, well-written ... I look forward to reading more books by Suzanne Collins.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Worth a laugh. It'd just about what you'd expect from the cast and creators. Have a few drinks with friends and laugh.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I love this application to view files on my Kindle Fire.  I can do simple tasks such as highlight, magnify, and write little quick notes on the program.  Great Abode for Kindle Fire, very comparable to how I use it on my computer.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Ok plot. MM is the same, as usual. Ending is lame. Wouldn't bother watching again, and doubt I'd recommend. Meh.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Always an excellent series, this third season just blew me away. Can't wait for the fourth edition to come to the US.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I love this CD. It's on my cloud. Phillip is the best. I've been needing something new and refreshing. Phillips hit it out of the park. He'll be around for a long time.
0439023521|5.0|The way we as humans have become this is a great book to get a new view on life. You can still feel compassion even when we are at our worst moments in life. This book has many lessons.
B00136NUG6|5.0|It's Earth, Wind & Fire's greatest hits. If you like Earth, Wind & Fire and you are thinking about buying this album stop thinking and just buy it. You already know you enjoy the music.

B003KRJNBW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Denzel in the Book of Eli. The film was well scripted and keeps the viewer guessing until the end. I truly was blindsided by its conclusion.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So addicted to this show. That is all I can say! Would definitely recommend. My husband watched ONE episode and he's also addicted now lol. If you haven't seen it, start watching!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is one of those stories that I really had a<br />Hard time putting down. Although I am not a fan of sci-fi I decided to give it a try. Glad I did. The plot and  character development are really ,really good. Good story very engrossing. I will be reading more !

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Any near-death experience is interesting to me, but to read the experiences of a neurosurgeon was amazing. This man had heard many of his patients tell their near-death stories and had always attributed it to a brain deprived of oxygen, but when he went into a coma and his own neocortex was shut down for seven days, he had a very different view of the phenomenon upon his recovery.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book about a book. It kept me going wanting to get to the end. Hazel and Gus were both charming and very intelligent well beyond their age. Loved it.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|Witty, romantic and funny look at life through the eyes of an 18 year old American girl in Paris for the first time.  Would be fun to see where this, up to now, predictable relationship leads.

B0001I562I|5.0|Another movie I remembered fondly from my childhood and purchased in order to share with my (12 year old) son. He loved it and has watched it a few times already!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|A solid overall album that takes the dance stylings that were so strong on Muse's last album, The Resistance, and blends them with more of the alt-rock flavor that brought them to fame initially.
B00BLGZDYA|3.0|I am appalled to discover that Amazon censors movies on VOD. And I thought censorship was dead. Well, it's not. It's alive and flourishing at Amazon!<br /><br />Knowing little about the scene in question, I initially thought the blur was the director's choice, perhaps to suggest that Mr. Merde had no genitalia. But, now, I understand differently and I am rather disappointed in Amazon and will AVOID RENTING R, NC-17 or unrated titles through their VOD service in future. They may not require membership, but they still charge a fee, so shouldn't their VOD be treated similarly to NetFlix, who I can confirm appears to not be constrained by FCC rules and regulations for TV/cable broadcast?<br /><br />At any rate, I'm going to be more cautious now when renting streaming movies from Amazon.<br /><br />UPDATE: I can't hold Amazon completely responsible, anymore, though they should be aware of any censorship in their streaming titles, and I would expect them to refuse titles from companies who censor them. The same censored version of this film has been added to another subscription-required streaming service. I thought they might have the uncensored version, since they require a membership, but they are streaming the same version as Amazon, so it must be the studio's decision to censor the movie for streaming purposes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! Very fun . And has some great graphics. A variety of scenes and lots of items to collect.
B008Y6R2UI|5.0|I loved this movie so much that I have mentioned to my friends, amazing story about love and the blessing of the Lord.
0393338398|5.0|I just started reading Moneyball, and so far it's great!  I love relating to the baseball language and the stories of Billy Beane as a player and recruiter.

0547569653|4.0|'Eat and Run' is a fun enough story.  'Born to Run' is more exciting to me, but the anecdotes in 'Eat and Run' are fun enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book more than any other books I'd ever read and I would read it over and over if I could. I would recommend this book to anyone with a 8 or 9th grade reading level.
0307592731|1.0|Wild was a fun enough story about hikes in the woods, but the anecdotes about her boyfriend life falling apart were too negative and something I couldn't relate to.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This movie lost my attention very quickly. It was not interesting and there was nothing to draw me in. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone. Unless you are in desperate need of a nap.
B008476HBM|5.0|Its one of the greatest novels ever written in the english language, and every time I read it is like reading it for the first time. So brilliant it almost hurts
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|i have some documents e-mailed to my kindle, and of course that changes the format to a kindle format. been banging my head trying to find something simple to convert these back to doc format. this did it. awesome app.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is a fantastic book that inspired me to do more with my creativity. It made me feel like I COULD do stuff, and that I didn't have to be unbelievably fantastic - just me.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragon Story is a great game, it's better than your average zoo/animal game because you can breed the dragons to get new ones, as well as visit other people's islands. There's always new dragons and new things, too. The only major flaw is the fact that the game only gets exciting every twenty or so hours- hatching an egg, growing food,and breeding dragons  WAY to long.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Bruno Mars voice! This album is full of fun and sexy songs. Many different types of songs too.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I never knew what I was missing before I got this mouse. You can customize every button from its own easy to install software. If you're looking for a great gaming mouse at a great price, look no further. The only problem I found with it is that you can't customize the color of the light at the front of the mouse, and that's such a small problem that doesn't even effect the use of the mouse. Good job Anker. Keep up the great work
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Just saw this movie and I can't believe I hadn't made the effort to see it before now. It is a fantastic movie. Don't let the title \\"War Horse\\" create a preconceived idea about the movie. My wife and teenage children also loved this movie.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder is a great game. PDF is ok, but physical books is where its at. Pathfinder is just D&D 3.5 plus, so enjoy
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I guess you could say I love horse movies. This story of the life of the great Secretariat is a very compelling and emotional drama about the greatest race horse to ever live.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Very entertaining, you need a good memory, I especially like having a hint button, also, if you get lost, there is a way within the game, to get directions!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|this app is somewhat difficult to deal with. it doesnt show up the way normal facebook does and so it makes it difficult to work
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is an awesome game but since I already have it, I can't get the Rome version. That was disappointing. :(
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this game is highly addicting and is a good way to get lost in time. it is a ton of fun and makes you actually think about what you are looking for. it makes me feel brain smart

B00BETX5PS|4.0|I'd like to point out the good quality in HD. The movie has a great beginning, but later there is almost no action at all. Javier Bardem character did not suit him. But the movie is great entertainment.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Who decided to take a classic as well defined as this story and put it through blotter acid?  The cast is, of course, fantastic.  Such a waste.  The money spent on outfitting them, plus the scenes, are equally money poured down a rat hole.  Normally, I don't attack a movie this aggressively.  But, Mein Gott!  This borders on trash.  On the horrific.  It ruins a spectular story set at an equally spectacular time -- exactly what Tolstoy was trying to talk about without the pompous and contrived theatrics. Whatever Wright and Bevan were attempting to do, they should have kept to themselves.  They trash the original story and waste the hard work of a brilliant cast, terribly misapplied.  Further, the Blue Ray version is simply terrible.  If you stop the thing for 5 minutes, you literally have to restart it all over again.  The movie is painful enough, but to have to crawl through UA's conception of the Blu Ray format is simply beyond description.  The whole package rots.
B00003CXBK|1.0|So let me start out by saying that i love this movie. It is, in my opinion the best Ghibli movie. This review is only one star because of the horrible experience i had with the seller Ultimate Discounts Canada. I was super excited when my DVD came in the mail... I hadn't seen Princess Mononoke since my VCR stoped working years ago.<br />So imagine my disappointment when i try to watch the movie and i cannot because the sound quality is so horrible. On both the original Japanese and dubbed English tracks, the background music and noise is loud and crackly, while the diologue is garbled, and muffled to the point of inaudiblility! It is really bizarre, I almost think it might be a bootleg copy!<br />So i contacted the seller right away (2 days after i got the DVD) but of course i never heard back from them. So i wrote a pretty rough seller review for them, thinking that may prompt some action, over a month later and i still haven't heard from them.<br />So the lesson to be learned from this is not to buy anything from Ultimate Discounts Canada, even though they had the best price for the movie, i should have just paid an extra three to five dollars and bought it from an honest seller.<br /><br />P.S. I still haven't watched Princess Mononoke again....
0062197266|3.0|This book was a good mystery, but at times totally predictable.  Sort of like a train wreck that you can't look away from.  I found myself asking \\"why don't you shoot him when he breaks in\\" alot.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Amazingly tender storyline that reaches out and pulls you into their world, touching your heart  and renewing your faith in the strength found in Love.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent directing, casting, editing and story.  Wonderfully done.  Friends raved about it and it is a MUST see. Thank you

B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is so great. I read the book to my 4 year old and we watched the movie and she loves it
B0049GYXDG|5.0|The Blu-ray version of this movie is the best ever! It is so beautiful and has many great special features. Great for kids and kids at heart!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|great just like hd tv. No problem ,sound was good . Color good ,great all the way and no comercials
B004K00NMG|5.0|This Blu-ray version has been remastered so the images are the crispest, most beautiful version yet! There are more special features than the DVD version as well. Great buy for a great price.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Great music, great vocals, almost like Janice is in the room.  The album can't be compared, though, to live performance seen on Austin City Limits.  That was amazing!!
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|This new release of Peter Pan is a must have in your Disney collection. It is an unaltered version of the movie and includes some deleted scenes and songs plus more special features. The movie itself is crisp and clear, probably better than when it first came out!
1939416019|2.0|This series is a promising start which could have been a great great saga, sadly it fails miserably. For a more thorough rant, see my review of the third (and for me, final) book in this series.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Why should I write another review, when to me the best reviews for this film are so spot-on terrific they can choke me up to the point of tears all by themselves.  Instead, I would like to focus on some things that I haven't seen mentioned yet.  But first, a bit of background.  To begin, I do not cry at sad movies.  I will sometimes tear up at happy ones.  But I have never cried throughout an entire movie, or at least 90% of it.  Yes, the emotion of this film is unmatched.  It is astonishingly intense throughout: electrifying, appalling, tragic, remarkably eye-opening, and finally, a most exquisite, triumphant victory of goodness and love over all that is not.<br /><br />The plot and story line have been so well covered by the other reviewers, that I need add nothing.  However, the characters, and the cast who play those roles are, with very few exceptions, breathtaking.  What I would like to add in this review is a bit of a comparison with the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables.  Much has been said about the \\"live\\" singing, and in addition, its (opinionated) below par quality as well.  Conversely, I was amazed at how magnificent it was!  I don't believe that someone who has never been in a recording studio can remotely appreciate how difficult it is to sing \\"live\\" like this cast did and make it sound good.  And as one reviewer pointed out, the combination of camera closeness and live singing allowed for magnificent articulation, where every word was clearly heard, and even felt, something so often absent in today's movies.<br /><br />Now the characters, bearing in mind that virtually the entire film is sung:  Ann Hathaway was magnificent as Fantine, and Eddie Redmayne as Marius may have been the best of all.  His \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" was a performance for the ages.  Samantha Barks was breathtaking as Eponine, and played that role in both the Concert and the film.  So here may be a good place for the comparison I mentioned earlier, and perhaps thebest place to begin is with Javert.  In the Concert, Javert was played by Norm Lewis, a brilliant baritone who also sings with great expression.  And although he can sing dramatically better in a professional sense than Russell Crowe, I have to give the nod to Crowe.  In fact I thought he was fantastic.  Maybe his voice doesn't compare with Lewis, and although Lewis's expression was superb, it was Crowe's acting-singing combination that caused a synergistic outpouring, and made his performance awesome.<br /><br />Now to Hugh Jackman.  As one reviewer said, he was \\"splendid...and it could be argued carried the entire film.\\"  Except...I had seen the Concert before the movie.  A British tenor, Alfie Boe, played Jean Valjean.  I am very far indeed from being an expert, but I now honestly believe he has the greatest male voice I have ever heard.  And I will tell you exactly why.  I think many would agree that \\"Bring Him Home\\" is one of the quintessential musical numbers in the film.  Alfie Boe is one of the very, very few tenors who can sing with both rich, full volume, and a magnificent falsetto as well, with which he can liltingly vocalize an extremely high note, very softly, and with perfect vibrato.  To me, the last line of \\"Bring Him Home\\" is perfect for this soft, emotional finish, and his standing ovation after this at the Concert seemed unending.<br /><br />This should not detract, but actually add to Jackman's terrific performance.  To sing \\"Bring Him Home\\" the way Jackman did was more difficult, not less!  And it should be a given that Jackman had one of the most difficult roles to play, ever.  At the beginning, it truly looked as if Jackman was \\"standing in his grave.\\"<br /><br />There is not much I can add to the performances of Colm Wilkinson as the loving, life-changing Bishop, while Amanda Seyfried as Cosette is a lovely soprano with spectactular range.  I will always have a warm spot in my heart for little Gavroche, played by Daniel Huttlestone.  Perhapsthe one negative thought I had was that in the Concert, Matt Lucas as Thenardier and Jenny Galloway as his Madame were a bit stronger than Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham in the identical roles in the film.  The movie, however, was able to capture the hilarious antics of the duo's pickpocketing methods that the Concert could not do.<br /><br />This was a movie that director Tom Hooper took considerable risks to bring us delightfully new things as well.  In addition to being entirely sung, I thought it was a bit of creative magic to use the same 4 or 5 melodic lines to create all of the songs, just with different lyrics.<br /><br />I hate to use an old cliché, \\"paradigm shift,\\" that in the nineties went so viral as to become virtually meaningless, but to me, this represents a true paradigm shift in filmmaking.  It is years ahead of its time and should become the standard that many later films strive for.  It was The Best Picture of the Year.  Period.
B007IK44CK|5.0|The movie was lame, but the quality was perfect.  Tom Cruise is lame.  I watched it on my Macbook Pro.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Solve increasingly complex puzzles unlock secrete levels. Great for kids. Sexual to where's my water. Hours of fun for only a dollar make this a great value.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is awesome!! The book gives you the emotions as if you had a deep relationship with Chris and Taya. I've raved about this book so much that two male friends of mine are reading it also. Chris is a humble American Hero.

0811729117|3.0|this is a very personal view of a number of areas of battle. It gives fairly detailed accounts of tactics and mild criticisms of the Tiger Tank. Some of his political biases detract from the book. Otherwise fair comment.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and I decided to buy the DVD to watch at a better quality. I got it right on time. I hope you guys have the opportunity to buy it. I can't wait for &#34;Catching Fire&#34; to come out!!!!!!

B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works as expected. Now I can use my mac book pro power adapters with my air. It's a pretty small adapter so my only worry is losing it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great TV show - very addictive.  It sort of reminds me of a cross between 24 and The X-Files.  Kind of gory at times if you have little ones in the house.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Great adaptation.  If you don't want to sit through 6 hours of A&E's version this turns it into a nice 2 hour package.  Cinematography was excellent
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What an incredible journey around our Planet Home.  I remember David Attenborough doing Nature programmes on the BBC when I was a nipper growing up in England. The hunt for the Kimono Dragon being a standout. And now here he is 86 years young and conducting this amazing tour around our globe. Beautifully packaged 5-Disc set. Alas in shipping the plastic housing got a bit messed up. But luckily the discs were unhurt. I definately recommend this seller (this was a &#34;used&#34; purchase) so perhaps a cardboard insert in the packing might have been advisable to preserve the package. Delivery was prompt.
0800141660|5.0|If you love Jane Austen you will enjoy this movie.  The liberties taken with it gel with the overall story.
1423136802|5.0|I was looking for books that I could read to my 8 year old son and 10 year old daughter since we recently finished reading the Harry Potter series.  My 10 year old read all of the books already but will still listen when I read to the 8 year old.  I recently read that it's important to keep reading to kids who can read themselves so they continue to get a better vocabulary.  These books are fun adventures that the kids enjoy listening to and I enjoy reading to them.  The price was $20--an awesome price for all five books in the series.  Great for boys and girls.  I highly recommend these books to kids who like Harry Potter books. We also watched the first movie and the kids loved it.  The second movie comes out in August 2013--we have to wait.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|Very different to a lot of movies of to-day but worth every bit mentioning as a top of the art movie. Cast are very convincing that its happening and your wrapped up in it as well, edge of the seat entertainment wonderfully portrayed and need to be told that it is everything as scary as the cover shows. Tell you more no way that would spoil it completely, storyline is fabulous so what more do you want, sit feet up and relax to a great night of entertainment with some friends and don't forget some munchies while your enjoying the show.
0316789720|5.0|This book is amazing for kids, but as an adult, I find it really helpful too. It's such a great quick reference guide to give you a basic shape, and then you can fill in as many details as you like. I use this book pretty regularly. For kids that like to draw, I consider it a must.
B00B8ESWAM|5.0|One is so smart he has created a new religion. He is charismatic and clever and shallow. The other man is smarter, so smart in fact that he sees beyond the first, beyond his drama into the void itself. He is so smart that he knows life is meaningless and armed with this understanding proceeds to destroy himself. The first man senses the depth of the second and seduces him into a brief affair that is the pinnacle of both lives.<br /><br />This is the story of L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology. Phillip Hoffman does his very best work here. It is a gentle story about the tragedy of  sentience. It portrays Scientology not as an evil cult but as something light and whimsical and it has the ring of truth. But it also paints tragedy onto the lives of ordinary people and it offers no answers. It is a bleak and dark film without hope and with much truth.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE minecraft but sometimes I can't pick up stuff :(<br />Please fix that<br />Awesome AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
B009A3NGF4|5.0|It's albums like this that make most of what the music industry produces these days seem even more like so much garbage. The heartfelt lyrics pierce the soul, at times, and the emotions build with guitars, banjos and even brass to a crescendo befitting the sentiment, never out of place or disjointed.<br />I nearly stood up off my couch when I saw that Best Album was awarded at the Grammys. Well deserved, and refreshing that an album this good is finally recognized by the masses that seem jaded by mediocrity.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I could not finish watching the movie because the download took hours and when It finally downloaded the next day, I had to stop it and then the rental got expired when I had the time to watched it.<br />Good movie, but bad rental amazon system. They should let the rental be for at least 3 days.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie, very interesting and good pace.  I also appreciated the extras at the end of the movie for additional historical background.
0553801473|2.0|I am a very long time fan of Mr. Martin.  I still hold up the first 3 books of this series as the greatest fiction I have ever read.  Perhaps that is why the last 2 books have hurt so much.  The first three books were gripping, fun, suspenseful, shocking, inspiring and on and on.  This book just has none of that.  It has taken characters we have grown to love and watered them down and made them very dull and, in some cases, very dumb.  By the end of the book it seems the characters and the story is almost no further ahead than at the end of book 3.  Will I read the next book?  Yeah...probably...if for no other reason than I still have hopes that Mr. Martin can resurrect the drama of the first three.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel was extraordinary (not his usual character) in this film as was John Goodman.  The plot and story line were excellent.  I watched it on a flight from Minneapolis to Tucson and would love to watch it again.  I think it would be even more dramatic on a screen bigger than my 9 inch Kindle.
B008NMT684|4.0|My son loves this game, so I recommend it. I was disappointed it didn't come with very many puzzles but you can purchase more.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|Lots of twists and turns...You will never guess how this book ends. This one was better than the first book.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Phillip Phillips is a great artist and I simply loved the album. Don't understand why radio/industry doesn't support artists that come out of American Idol it's a shame. But I guess this album have at least 3 top 10 singles.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I chose this rating because it would be wrong to give it a four. All the songs are great and the majority of them are my personal favorites. Some are laid back songs, and others feature recognizable singers which makes awesome sauce over spectacular spaghetti.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|This was an amazing story and more so because it is based on a true story.  Goes to show the danger of unchallenged authority from a govt agency, in this case the LAPD.
B0095P29EG|4.0|Lighthearted, Lots of action, and sprinkled with a little humor. Great movie for a household full of growing and imaginative boys.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really really good! I didn't like the killing. This would be a good book for my sister when she grows up.

0802473156|3.0|5 Love Languages helped me analyze my current relationship and reflect inwardly about what was causing tension in my relationship and what could alleviate that tension.  That said, I found the text repetitive and containing generalizations about societal roles and female/male stereotypes.  It's the kind of book you can read at the gym, and for the low price, it's worth it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very good sound effects, which can be mixed and matched to create a soundscape all your own.  Start with &#34;rain&#34;, then touch &#34;night&#34;, and the night sounds are added to the &#34;rain&#34; sounds.  You can keep overlaying more and more sounds.  I downloaded this while in the hospital recently, and it was very effective at lulling me to sleep.  I highly recommend it.
B00846REIS|3.0|Story line tries too hard to imitate 50 Shades. Sex scenes are more contrived and explicit; sometimes they are disturbing.
B000I5XOW8|4.0|This movie was made in Chicago,I'm from Chicago & miss it alot & Blu-ray shows it well...!!! This is a great flix..

B009WO7NQO|3.0|I buy the game and it`s fun and addictive. Then I have to pay for more levels. now its been since xmas 2012 and the last levels havent even been released in an already short game.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Despite some negative reviews I found this book to be very entertaining and easy to read, although not as fast paced as the first book it is is still a very good read, recommend to anyone who enjoyed the firs book.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This is a really addictive game.  It can be quite challenging, but can be set for easier puzzles.  I really enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Test your knowledge like the Cube.  Fun, relaxing, challenging and fun for the whole family.  Must pay attention to what is going on.  Don't look away.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed playing this game.  Each chapter is different and more exciting and challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you are sitting around waiting on kids, laundry, cooking dinner, walking the dog, this is a perfect past time.
B00005AR3G|2.0|I purchased the DVD for a church ministry and was under a short timeline.  I was pleased the DVD arrived on time, but then was very disappointed that it skipped many times starting in the middle of the movie.  I ended up using another version that a friend had for the ministry but now I feel I'm out $15.  I guess that's what I get for waiting to the last minute and trying to save some money for our church.  Won't do that again.  Very disappointed!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|first thinking game to challenge me<br />the graphics are awesome but I wish there was a way to make new friends
B008JFUMT2|2.0|Twentieth Century-Fox has been beating this dead horse for twenty-five years. It is kind of cute and quaint; when every studio is remaking classic films or trying to rejuvenate a once successful franchise with a 'prequel', Fox steadfastly decides to keep plugging away and we have the fifth \\"Die Hard\\" film, quite possibly the worst, and hopefully the last.<br /><br />Fox does introduce us to a younger character who could take over the franchise, if necessary and if this film makes enough money. This has been done before, but it doesn't work. The reason we want to see an \\"Indiana Jones\\" film is to see Harrison Ford play the role he made famous. The reason we want to see a \\"Die Hard\\" film is to see the role that made Bruce Willis' film career. But let's face it, while Willis has held up better than his \\"Expendables\\" co-stars, he won't last forever and Fox will probably try to make at least one more \\"Die Hard\\", which is why he now has an adult son, played by Jai Courtney (the unstoppable hit man in \\"Jack Reacher\\"). Conceivably, Courtney will take over the series and play Die Hard in the next film.<br /><br />John McClane learns his son, John (Courtney) has been arrested for murder in Russia. The elder John decides to travel there; what he hopes to accomplish, he doesn't seem to know and we never learn. But he arrives in Moscow just in time for his son's sentencing, which happens to take place at the exact same time as the sentencing of a Russian businessman, Kamarov (Sebastian Koch), the main rival of Chagarin, both of whom are the top candidates for the Minister of Defense position. Chagarin has jailed his rival, in the hopes he will talk and reveal the whereabouts of a damaging file. But he won't so an attempt is made on the heavily fortified courthouse on the day of the trial, causing a lot of confusion and destruction. This only allows John the Younger to help Kamarov to escape. Just as they are leaving the courthouse, John literally drives right into his father before speeding off. But John the Elder senses something is wrong (all of the explosions are a giveaway) and chases after them. But the bad guys are also in hot pursuit and the three groups began a destructive, improbable, yet exciting chase through the crowded Moscow city center. Eventually, we learn that Junior is an undercover CIA agent sent to help Kamarov. But there are more secrets leading to a showdown at Chernobyl. Yes, Chernobyl.<br /><br />Directed by John Moore (\\"Max Payne\\", \\"The Omen (2006)\\", \\"Flight of the Phoenix (2004)\\") and written by Skip Woods (\\"The A-Team\\"), \\"Good Day\\" has one good action sequence (the chase through the Moscow streets) but little or no character development, the most inane dialogue I have ever heard in an action film (that's saying a lot) and a story that is tasteless. Mix all of this together and this IS the worst \\"Die Hard\\" film.<br /><br />Generally, sequels tend to get bigger in scope because the filmmakers hope this will increase the odds of you purchasing a ticket for the new film. The \\"Die Hard\\" films are no exception; the first film is set in a Los Angeles office building, the second in an airport, the third in New York City, the fourth concerns a threat to the entire country and this new film features an international adventure. Yet, oddly with each new film the storytelling seems to shrink and the smaller scope has an adverse effect on the quality and substance of the films. A lot of the reason for this is that as each film expands the threat, the writing seems to become more rote and much less interesting. The first film is still the best because the threat to John is very personal. He just happens to arrive at his wife's office building as a group of terrorists takes it over to hold everyone hostage. The original is a terrific film, giving us a lot of detail and back-story for the hero and the villain, making both of them very human and believable. And it never hurts to have Alan Rickman in your film playing the villain.In \\"II\\", the threat is increased, but however improbable, McClane and his wife are still under threat, so there is still some immediacy to the action. With each new film, McClane has evolved further and further into a cartoon character getting into improbable situations with no character development. In \\"Good Day\\", the action seems small and confined, despite the international locale. What does John McClane expect to do in Russia? How does he see this plan unfolding? Part of the delight of the first film is that McClane is thrust into a situation and has to figure out how to control it. In this new film, he enters this world and begins to insinuate himself into it. Yes, he is trying to help his son, but he isn't under threat until he steps into this situation and begins messing around.<br /><br />One of the keys to making this film work is to make us feel some empathy towards the characters. Willis seems to smirk his way through the entire film. There are brief moments between McClane and his partner and between McClane and his daughter (who was taken hostage in the fourth film), but these don't do anything except establish the fact that John is estranged from his son. And when Courtney enters the picture, it is clear the family dynamic is strained, John Jr. holds a gun on his father which is an interesting way to illustrate the family dynamic for us. It also does nothing to make us like J.J. Later, after they barely escape a barrage of bullets, John Sr. begins chastising his son as he contemplates removing a piece of rebar sticking out of his chest. \\"Are you going to cry? You're not going to cry on me are you?\\" Maybe John Jr. has a reason to feel estranged from his father. John Sr. seems like a pretty big jerk. And this moment does nothing to build any sense of family between them. Also, because we don't really like either of them who are we supposed to root for? Later, it seems as though someone flips a switch because suddenly the father and son are working together in harmony, smiling and joking with one another.<br /><br />The film eventually ends up at Chernobyl as the McClanes attempt to stop the villains from removing enriched uranium. Chernobyl? Really? This just seems incredibly tasteless. As the film casually states, 50,000 people were immediately moved and uprooted when the meltdown happened. The film doesn't seem to dwell upon the deaths or resulting health problems experienced by so many people in the area. This isn't surprising because it would no doubt turn off a lot of the viewers and cut into the popcorn sales.<br /><br />I keep going to the \\"Die Hard\\" films because I am an optimist. I keep hoping that one of these films will be able to at least approximate a small portion of what made the first film so good. Great action, edge-of-your-seat suspense, a brilliant villain, and a personal threat to the hero making us feel for his character and really care about what happens to him. In \\"Good Day\\", the villain is forgettable and after one of his henchmen dies, almost nothing of interest happens with this group. It is not a good thing when the villain's henchman is more interesting than the actual villain. Quick, what was the name of each villain who employed Jaws in the two James Bond films? But if you say \\"Blofeld\\" to any James Bond fan, they immediately know who you are talking about. There is no suspense. McClane walks into a situation and then starts shooting, so we really don't feel anything for him or his son.<br /><br />And Courtney is really never given anything to do with his portrayal of John Jr. He is an undercover CIA agent who has to deal with an increasingly difficult situation, but the development of his relationship with his father is laughable and does nothing to make him likable. And because he isn't likable, we don't care about what happens to him.<br /><br />Maybe this is the studio's way of setting up the sequel, \\"Die Hard with Charm\\". Die Hard Jr. (Courtney) attends charm school to make him amore likable character. While there, the strict German headmistress, Fraulein Gruber (Alan Rickman in drag) decides to extract her revenge. The story almost writes itself.er in harmony, smiling and joking with one another.<br /><br />The film eventually ends up at Chernobyl as the McClanes attempt to stop the villains from removing enriched uranium.

B001P1MZNI|5.0|This album is a good way to reminisce of times when good entertainment was presented with or after dinner.  Those were the days.
B00BHMF578|2.0|It just did not live up to the hype. It was slow and boring with little connection to the characters who seemed flat
B00BHMF578|5.0|Found this to be a great telling of a impressive feat. I very much felt the anxiety of the state department employees.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun game that is a great way practice coordination. I love all the other things about it, the mystery boxes and hover boards. It is a very well made game.
1451673442|5.0|The Magic offers a practical daily way to change your life! While I also enjoyed The Secret, The Power, and books in the same genre by other authors, this one is by far the most reasonable to use. Unlike the others, which basically tell you to change your thinking, this book tells you how to do so. I have already purchased it for family and friends. Thank you, Rhonda Byrne!

B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is one of those new generation love stories that so many people can relate to on their own or from observing others.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Having been born in Kansas, raised in Iowa and having both sets of grand parents pioneering Nebraska I enjoyed the comments on all. Yes there are some problems with the story plot reaching too far but in all other aspects it was classic Reacher. We read Reacher books because Lee Child does a good job of setting up a premise with the desire to know why something happened and the sure knowledge that he will peal the story layer by layer until there is a satisfactory ending in the ineditable way Reacher solves problems. I enjoyed the ending. Hemingway was a stickler for well written endings having re-writting the last page of the &#34;Sun also Rises&#34; 39 times. This ending qualifies.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Loved this book and couldn't put it down. The characters are complex and interesting. The plot is very well written.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I wasn't sure how well this series would be received, personally with me, myself. But, I was curious about it. Yes, I heard about the nudity and the violence and blood. It's hard to ever get over the blood because of the way it is presented, and the nudity I could look pass. But I confess, the story of Spartacus did capture my attention. I can't help but wonder how much of this story is based on historic evidence or fiction. Most of it I am guessing is fiction.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Couldn't put this one down! What an amazing end to this intriguing story!  Very well written story with so many twists that you can't possibly be bored.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I don't care how much the critics rip into this movie, I thought it was great. I've read the first three books within the series and I felt the writers of the film improved upon the original story.

B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Pretty much all I have to say. Can't put a finger on it, just not as good. I watched season one in a weekend, couldn't stop. This one is more of a \\"when I feel like it\\" I get an episode in.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|While this might be a good movie to watch simply for its entertainment value, it fails miserably in its accuracy of the real story. One would have to be completely naive and stupid to think they just one day found OBL hangin' out down the street and decided to go gangbusters on his ass just out of nowhere on a 24 hour notice! Are you kidding! LOL! I could go on, But really, why bother? Ignorance is bliss. Be happy and tuck kids in with a smile. HAha.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults both.  It is funny but at times a little sad.  In the end it all turns out great.  This family highly recommends it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|First off, I'm compelled to mention I am Christian (or try to be anyway)...  Great writing overall and was helpful that a very well-educated person wrote this.  Yet, the experience itself was painfully short, related few answers, and I feel should have been emphasized more.  Instead, nearly the entirety of the latter half of the book deals with the author's semi-coherent blabbering regarding the concept of consciousness.
0375836675|5.0|this book defies categories and, depending on your take of the ending, will leave you annoyed or exhilarated... but more on that later.<br />it's laugh-out-loud funny in spots, seems to be a mystery, but continually hits the core of humanity with poignancy. the author has an almost bottomless ability to twist the english language into unexpected poetry. he's today's shakespeare with new uses of words that should become the standard (beautiful) way of speaking:<br /><br />\\"I nearly forgot.\\" I stop running and stand about fifteen meters in front of him. \\"Your brother.\\" The father's eyes reach a little closer. \\"He said to tell you that greed hasn't swallowed him yet.\\"<br />The priest's eyes lighten then, with a touch of regret poured gently into them. \\"My brother, Tony...\\" His words are soft, and they hobble toward me. \\"I haven't seen my brother in a long time - how is he?\\"<br />\\"Not bad.\\" I say it with a confidence I don't understand. Only a gut feeling tells me it's the right answer, and we stand there now, among awkwardness and the rubbish.<br /><br />as for the ending - the way i interpreted it - i saw the validity of a concept that couldn't fit into a ending. and should a small thing like an ending really determine whether or not something gets published? this is a young adult novel and hits that audience exactly where it needs it. that final sentence of the book IS the point
B00069FLC2|5.0|I enjoy the Shadows a lot.  This video shows the group at their best.  The sound is excellent and the video shots are crisp.
B00338QENI|1.0|i had to read this, it was so boring, so heavy-handed in describing the &#34;injustice&#34; the woman endured, and annoying how the writer insinuated herself into the storyline.

0545128285|5.0|Those of you who consider the reading of the seven \\"Harry Potter\\" books series enough - maybe know a thing or two about the magical imaginary world of wizardry and witchcraft - but really, on the other hand, miss on something truly special found only when reading \\"The Tales Of Beedle The Bard\\".<br />At first, this humble little book may seem as some kind of sophisticated marketing gimmick - another way to milk money from this empire called \\"Harry Potter\\" by J.K. Rowling; But as the reader get into the book, it's easy to recognize the effort, creativity, muse, heart and soul that the writer gave to these five enchanting tales supposedly written by Beedle The Bard himself (which, as we all know, is another figure created by Rowling's wild imagination).<br />To start with, you get the line \\"Translated from ancient Runes by Hermione Granger\\" on the first page of the book, a thing I find rather funny and original. Second, between the stories you'll get to read \\"Dumbledore's\\" explanations and remarks on each and every story, his experience with them, his educational conclusions about the lesson taught by the stories, and lots of serenity pearls coming (well, more or less) from the former-headmaster at Hogwarts School, the known wizardry school from the seven books... That's something, in my opinion, that goes to show there's no really any limitation to the imagination ability; After all, Rowling could have chosen to write these essays in her name, but she chose to speak through one of her character's mouth - a rather original idea!<br />And that's even before we get to the stories themselves, which, as I described them earlier, are enchanting indeed. If you'll follow loyally this little friendly book until the last page, you shall meet the selfish wizard that didn't follow his good natured father's ways and therefore was punished by a very angry magical pot; The three young charming witches who found their way to the fountain of youth (which happens to not have even a drop of magic in it, but leads them to think they earned rightfully the right to bath in its holly water); The mad wizard who swore not to surrender ever to the weakness of emotions, and for that reason locked his heart in a chest down his own dungeon - an extreme action that leads in the end to some tragic results; You'll meet Babbity Rabitty, an elderly witch which revealed the stupidity of a muggle king and a greedy and corrupt fake-wizard; And finally (most notably, I believe) you'll get to explore once more that wonderful tale of three brothers trying to cheat death after meeting him one fateful day on a bridge - a story most faithful \\"Harry Potter\\" followers will surely remember from the seventh and final book in the series.<br />There are several reasons not to pass over this little charmer of a book, if you ask me. The first is that I truly found it refreshing not to encounter any mentioning (beside Dumbledore and Hermione, maybe) of Harry's enemies and friends (The Weasleys, The Durselys, Voldemort, Snape or Malfoy). What you'll get here is just a glimpse to the fairy tale world of Wizards kind, a thing interesting. Another reason to have this one is that it's the only place you'll get to see Rowling's own drawings - and I must say, she's an awesome surprising painter. Another good reason to give \\"Beedle The Bard\\" a chance is that it's a book very light and easy for reading, short and sweet, and there's no way you'll put it aside because it goes on and on without end... On the contrary, it will leave you with a desire for more... I, for one, will be more then delighted to see a continuation someday to these stories. Wave your imaginary wands, my muggle friends, and have once more a truly high-quality escapism!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have played similiar ones of these before and feel it exercises my  older brain and is enjoyablef for me
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Couldn't stop watching one after another!!!  Each character is perfect and now I want to go to England! Can't wait for season 4!!!
034580404X|5.0|I am glad I bought it! It is brand new and got it for a very good price .. ..
B004FHP9KA|5.0|The reviews were excellent and I can see why. If you have never seen it, do so. I was skeptical when it first came out and it took me this long to see it. Did not know what I was missing.
1451695195|5.0|Having some understanding about the medical details of his condition, I greatly appreciated his explanation of what he endured together with his NDE. One can find it a bit peculiar that  there is no mention of Christ, such as was found in Heaven is for Real by Todd Burpo.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|As you can see from the title of my review, the meat of what you need to read the Bible and take notes and bookmark is all here. Even follow along with sermons if your church supports it and much more. However...<br /><br />My phone is on version 4.1.X while we're still on 4.0.X here in Amazonland. This normally wouldn't bother me except the reliability of the functions within the app has markedly increased with that update.<br /><br />I'd like to see the interface be more tablet friendly also. Right now, it's just like the phone except bigger. Being able to read translations side by side or have your notes to the side while reading would be an excellent use of the extra screen space.
0765325950|5.0|My collection is finally complete! This was the perfect ending to a long-loved series. The package arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Totally addictive!  I almost always read &#34;adult&#34; books, but once in awhile I choose one that appears to be for adolescents.  I am almost always satisfied with my choice.  This story took me out of myself and into a world that hopefully will never be<br />for us.  I loved the characters, the described scenery, and enjoyed the detail the author included.  I think both adolescents and adults as well as seniors would love this book.  I even loved the film which I saw after finishing the trilogy.  I read this on my Kindle so had it with me wherever I went.  I even forgot it when I went on a weekend vacation and almost had a panic attack.  I discovered &#34;Cloud&#34; (from my granddaughter) and quickly had it sent to my IPhone.  I became a happy camper.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is the type of book,if possible, one should read over a stormy weekend, away on vacation or recovering from the flu because you just don't want to put the book down! The author accomplishes in her novice journey what most of us during times of turmoil need to strengthen and fortify us against the disappoinments and challenges life dishes out without regard to an individuals character or circumstances. I felt stronger in character just for having read the book. I am an native Oregonian and know many of the places the author traveled; especially The Columbia River Gorge where her jouney ends at the Bridge of The Gods; a visually stunning area. I can only imagine the remote beauty of the PCT she saw from California to Oregon!
B009G78EE2|5.0|I downloaded it to hear the song thrift shop but ended up seriously falling in love with every other song.
0307272702|2.0|just another book to make money for Gary Taubes.  If you got 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' already, you are set.  This 'Why we get fat' is the same kind of book, but written in a more simple way with less technical phrases.  I did not finish reading it by the way.
B00003CXA2|5.0|i think this is one of the 20 best movies ever, it has fun, action, history, teaching, is very well done & is a treat for a parent guidance audiences & it will always stay in your heart. im sure you will enjoy it. i had it first on widescreen video but im not using my vcr anymore, so i bought it again on dvd. this is one movie i want to have forever.
1439181780|3.0|Just go for this book.  It is well done, a nice refreshing book for the Law of Attraction movie done back in 2006.  The small size of this book makes it very hand to carry around and I like the way the book is divided into small portion.  A kind of 'Grab, read and put aside book'.
B002WN35DC|5.0|A classic literature from childhood to adult age.<br />No matter how young or old you might be, this a must read for everyone. I first read it in french and just loved it (paperback) it was given to me as a gift from, by the way, a french friend I have.<br />The teachings and illustrations are not common, they make you think. Must read it.
0470932139|3.0|Full of great photos and nice colors.<br /><br />Full of great ideas on how to take picture of foods, without having to run to the store to buy some expensive equipment again.<br /><br />The explanations are plain simple and easy to understand.<br /><br />About half way to the book, it gets a bit repetitive but over all, a good buy.
B007MJKOY4|5.0|I download this movie (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy [HD]) and found it enjoyable to watch. I think it is definitely worth the purchase and worth downloading.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I started watching this series just as a last thought not knowing a lot about it.  After watching the first and then the second Episodes from season one we were hooked...
B007P3S1AQ|4.0|I download this movie (Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close [HD]) and found it enjoyable to watch. I think it is definitely worth the purchase and worth downloading.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I agree that this is the best series we have ever watched.  Keep the Kleenex handy though.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|Argo is -- by far -- one of my favorite movies seen in a long time, so naturally I was especially happy to purchase it immediately once it became available.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Its a wonderful book, everybody should read it!, I recommend to do the experiments, and you'll be surprised when they work.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|Surprising disappointed with this film, primarily due to Clint Eastwood's lackluster performance, and etc. Amy Adams was great, as always.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Ad-free says it all!  Still the best game ever. have to find a charger just to keep playing, Another must have app.
B007SSEU9O|5.0|Awesome movie! Great performance! I download this movie (The Iron Lady [HD]) and found it enjoyable to watch. I think it is definitely worth the purchase and worth downloading.

B005GSY23M|5.0|Great soundtrack for anyone who loved the movie. The 80s vibe splashed with the Instrumentals is a great mix. I recommend it
B007JRUA7K|3.0|I download this movie (My Week With Marilyn [HD]) and found it enjoyable to watch. I think it is definitely worth the purchase and worth downloading.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Really great album. Bought this without knowing anything about them, I just really dug the song amazon gave to me for free. I am glad I bought the whole album. Fun, exciting and catchy.
B00364K6YW|5.0|You will either love it or not.  This is classic TV at its best!  Jane Austin's book has never been better portrayed.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Awesome movie. If your a fan of the dark knight and batman begins then of course youll like the last movie. It's epic but a little far fetch. The bluray is a perfect example of what a bluray should and sound like. Lacks any real special features though. Makes me wonder if they will re release it later on
B008IBPMZG|5.0|The characters were developed in a way that allows you to really relate to them, I couldn't stop watching once I started.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|This is a classic horror flick. Rented and streamed it from amazon and it looked great. Could of been louder but it was probably my computer monitor speakers
B0063GORYU|3.0|I like the game. I don't like the fact that you can't pay to get rid of the ads. The ads take away from the game. It would have been 5 stars if it weren't for that.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Bought the album not knowing anything about them. Turned out that it was totally worth the money. It's a good mix of rock and electronic music.very catchy stuff
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was just as good as the first book, I cant wait until the movie comes out. Im sure its going to be good
0761171703|5.0|The book is beautiful. The pictures are vibrant and really come to life. It's a great book for any dancers you know.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|It's typical Donald Fagen, which I always enjoy. I especially like the first cut, Slinky Thing. Good to have some new Stelly Dan.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Deftones are back. Every album they evolve but are consistent. It's nothing mind blowing but most of us know what deftones can do and who they are. I recommend their first 2 albums for any new fans before jumping into this bad boy
B00005ABII|5.0|Well, I love this band so I love this cd! Highly recommend if you're a fan, too! Enjoy every song!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great mix of hip hop, artsy emotional driven lyrics and pop culture. Just let the beat ride and heart felt topics flow. Great buy
B004XDYJRU|5.0|What a joy to see all the options that are available to me. I listen to radio all the time and love it that I can get so many options so easily.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|Good quality blu ray transfer, good special features and digital copies. The movie I felt was pretty good but not his best still, I recommend it. If your new to the Wes Anderson world I wouldn't recommend starting off with this movie
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Recommend to everyone who like Les Miserables story. Thanks for make Les Miserables 10th Aninversary Concert to CD, I can enjoy everytime  i like.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I watched it on line several times and then ordered the DVD/CD.  The entire concert is wonderful.  You gotta love Adele.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig does a great job as the newly cast James Bond for our time. Today's Bond is more of an action-hero that the original, but then that's the nature of today's movies. Boom, bang, splash and dash. Not that there wasn't plenty in the old ones with Sean, but there were more double entendres and a bit of living well mixed in with the mayhem. After the Sean Connery era, I liked the actors that followed, but I thought Bond was becoming too cartoonish. I tuned out the Bond movies until Craig came along. I'm a big fan of his and he's just right for the times.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is so brilliant love it xx it's a great way to pass t h e time x recommended to all who love puzzles x
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I loved the music choices, the delivery, and the humor in this movie.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals with a modern twist.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app its like a diary I write down everything I do. You can  change the covers and the covers are so pretty..
0399160450|5.0|A good dfollow-up to the earlier Jack Ryan novels. The usual line-up of the world's current villians trying to take down the US, with predictable catastrophe for them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I #love Subway Surfers. It's such an addition. I can't stop playing!!!!!!# If you enjoy action games this the right one for you!!!!###
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Excellent movie of Led Zeppelin doing a good job playing their standards. A must-have addition to any music lover's collection, but it reinforces my feeling that they are too old to be doing concerts any more.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This seek/find game has it all.  Several rooms with numerous objects, simple picture find, shadow find, flashlight find.  Once you start you can't put in down.  Also lets you open up the picture to give you a better view.  Highly recommend this one.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|Excellent movie of Rick Riordan's first book in the Percy Jackson tales! Pretty accurate to the books with minor plot deviations to move the story along. Excellent portrayal of Hades.
B005EHILV4|4.0|Compact, lightweight and simple to use.  I needed a USB interface in order to record guitar and vocals on my lap-top, and this unit works well.  Next time I might get a higher-end version with multiple low-z mike inputs and more channels, but this unit is perfect for my initial foray into recording.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Good melding of the various plot lines of Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, and Capt America. Great plot an thrilling action. A must-see movie which sets up the follow-ups to come.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This was a great book, suspense until the very end......never saw the villain coming!!!!  Please keep these awesome books coming.
B004SCJWNW|5.0|Read it for my book club and everyone loved it. Fascinating story of a true life gutsy woman who has changed and saved lives. Thank you Henrietta Lacks.
0670024813|2.0|enjoyed &#34;collapse&#34; and &#34;guns..&#34; and was looking forward to nights by the fire with &#34;the world...,&#34; but it's a collection of paragraphs covering 39 societies. if you can keep all 39 straight in your head as you go from paragraph to paragraph, the book will be an easier read. i had to stop, skim ahead to see if anything jumped out, and donate it to the library unfinished.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game rocks! too much fun. a fun way to pass the time. easy and addictive and free...what more could you want from an app.
B0034G4OYK|1.0|Unfortunately we never watched this film. My grandchildren had seen the film in the theater and were anxious to watch it on 3d.  The 3d previews play but when it was time for the feature film - it would not load.  This has happened twice with the same movie so I am in the process of sending the second one back.  I will then purchase it locally so there isn't the wait time.  I must say this is the first time this has happened with a film purchased through Amazon.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game, if you can call it a game.  Very relaxing to play but can be perplexing.  Being of the 70+ age group, this helps keep my grey matter in working order.:)
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A great free classic for me to read on my Verizon Nokia 822 Windows Phone using the Kindle book app.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|I was pleased to be able to upgrade my older VHS tape of this classic tale of U-Boats versus the Brits.<br />Very much worth watching on a snowy winter day.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I really love the movie, but the one I had recieved has a really bad digital glitch in it so I did not get to enjoy my movie. I purched it on the 2/8/13 and it was last movie from Bond collection that I was trying to watch. I got around to opening it on 2/27/13 and trying to watch it. All I need is an exchange but I am stuck with a defective movie. I order a lot of Blu-rays.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I just got into this program half way thru season three. We were able to rent season one at the local Family Video but wanted to enjoy season two at our own pace.<br /><br />May buy Season one and three when available
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun I like frizzy Carmen Talbot jake Lucy Roberto zoe and Prince k those are the characters and I love the mystery boxes oh and I like trixy
B003MC5AV2|2.0|Immature,and too young for average reader and more suited for a tween.I would nit recommend  this book  for an older reader.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I love the app, but buying it through Amazon App Store forces me to login to Amazon App Store in order to work.  So if I don't have a network connection or go into Airplane Mode then my calendar is not accessible.  Amazon credited the cost of the app so now I'm going to delete it and then buy it grom Google Play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is perfect for anyone! Please get the game, the graphics are great and the horses look realistic! Totally get if you love horses!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love, love, love it!  Besides Homeland one of my favorite series.  Love all the characters it has a great story line and I can't think of one thing I don't love about it, except I wish it was on every night!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I had to stop watching this movie about half way in it was so bad.<br /><br />The dialogue in the movie is excruciatingly cheesy, it sounds like a play put on by 16 year olds in high school. The acting wasn't great either, but it was hard to tell if it was the writing causing the problem :)<br /><br />Also, it's boring, very boring. It's hard to empathize or connect with a single character in the movie, I was just waiting for it to be over.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Really intriguing book. Found it to be a very easy read and I learnt a lot from reading it. Thoroughly recommend this to anyone.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I've enjoyed Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn and was interested to see how he would do with a new cast of characters. This is a shorter book but chock full of amazing ideas. It actually made me wish there were more books in a series!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I picked up this app last year and have nothing but praises for it.  It's easy to use and bug free from my experience using it. I really like it.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I was moved and interested by the descriptions of the US Navy Seals and what they do.  It seemed, on occassion that Luttrell was a little self-serving in his narration, but overall, I was fascinated by the story of these brave warriors.
140053271X|4.0|but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military. Convenient sized, easy to use after the software issue was resolved. The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update. Works fine now.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I am not getting tired of hearing this collection from the concert in Gdansk. You will enjoy it ponder it and replay it often.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit - It's a good choice if you are looking for something lighthearted and life-affirming.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely! If you are looking for any translation of the Bible, this app works! This helps with deeper understanding of a text. It's also good on the go!
B00913DPW2|5.0|I've been working on this game on and off since I downloaded it as a FAOTD. And I STILL haven't finished it yet. I've had to go to the walkthrough a few times already. But, that's ok. I'm enjoying the challenge. This game seems to go on, and on, and on..., with decent graphics. It's also really creepy, but probably only 'scary' for younger audiences. Because it is so challenging, and can take so long to work through, I'd say it is well worth the price. Nothing wrong with getting tired of working on it, and coming back at a later time to continue the game. Kindle Fire HD and HTC Inspire. Kind of detailed to work with on phone, but doable.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I had never rented a movie from Amazon, but I am so glad that I did. I LOVED watching the movie at the comfort of my home and the price was great. I didn't even hesitate to rent it. All I really have to say is that I love this movie and I'm so buying it!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|A great reminder of the Old Las Vegas never to come again.  Perfect to set the mood for a 60's party.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending and interesting twist and turns. Some spots were a little confusing to understand, but still really enjoyed it.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Railman Dewey (Ethan Suplee) is driving his freight train when he has to put the engine on slow automatic drive so that he can get out of his cab to change mis-set points ahead. Unfortunately, the gear lever jumps from slow into high speed, so that the train moves faster than Dewey can catch up with it to get back on board. As the engine with its half-mile long train of wagons containing lethal cargo gathers momentum, it heads towards other trains on the tracks, in particular, one driven by veteran railman Frank Barnes (Denzil Washington) with his new young conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine). Colson has mistakenly attached five wagons too many onto the train, which makes it too long to fit into a siding out of the way of the runaway. The sum total of the plot revolves around attempts to bring this runaway train under control. The acting and direction (by Tony Scott, making his last film) are excellent. The fact that the story is based on a real-life incident on the Pennsylvania Railroad makes it all the more exciting.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The first twenty-five times you try it loads for two minutes then it says doodle God has stopped working but when it stop that nonsense otherwise the game is great with child mode it says no bad words and I use no periods hahaha
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Day-Lewis' performance is so good. This movie a is dark and beautiful historical piece about a man with boundless ambition who loved money more than people. You must watch this if you're a movie buff.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I bought season 1, 2, and 3!!! All amazingly great. I'm so glad I bought them. <3 it.  I couldn't be happier. Watched them a hundred times now. No joke:)
B0031OCY2E|5.0|This movie is spectacular..especially bc it's a true story. Matt Damon's performance is spot on and hilarious. Some reviewers say it's slow but it's not at all. It's just dark and dry.. like the British version of The Office which I also prefer to the US version. I've watched it a at least 10 times and love it more every time. So if you're looking for Dumb and Dumber or Anchorman you probably won't be into this.. but it's your loss.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game!<br />and its free and entertaining.<br />love the updates especially the different places.<br />love the new rome cant wait to see the new place!
B00B8ESWAM|5.0|this is a beautifully written, acted, shot and directed film. by an american director. crazy right? you're the one who's crazy if you don't immediately watch it. this is american cinema at it's best. do it.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|President Obama takes you on a touching journey of his life as a boy and a young man.  His insights and experiences gives the reader a clear understanding of who he is today and why.  Beautiful read this book is.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Our kids will carry with them everything we teach them, they will then teach their children and so on.  Future generations are affected by the what we do today!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It's been a long time since I've stayed up late to read a book. Hated to turn out the light, couldn't wait to continue reading the next day. I think I might knit myself a red scarf, to feel like I belong! Definitely at the top of my favorites list, don't miss it!!
B005RZB65Q|5.0|I fully enjoyed this book and now I want to recommend it to lots of people. My friends and I started a small book club and chose this book as a starter. Usually, I don't like self-help kind of books very much. I have tried some best-sellers, but always I found it repetitive and dull in the middle. However, this book was a right one for me, I guess. Maybe it's a too clear-cut distinction to divide our mindset into only two, fixed mindset or growth mindset. Still I couldn't put it down because I could see myself in this book. The author used a lot of examples, which made the concept even easier to understand. The message is, you can change. It is really encouraging. I'm really thankful to my friend who chose this book for the book club. One thing I couldn't help noticing was that the author mentioned Tiger Woods again and again as a model of growth mindset and I wondered if she would write the same way today.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|A real page turner. Follett keeps you on the edge of your seat with this fast paced story filled with engaging characters.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My 3 year old daughter absolutely LOVES this game. She had played the free version for quite a while, then got very excited about new patients with the full version. She is learning how important it is to keep herself clean through having to get the germs out of the animals. And she says she wants to be an animal doctor when she grows up!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Such a great movie. Some sad parts, of course I cried. This was one of my youngest sons favorites couple years ago.
B007Y612KA|2.0|I thought with cast such as those listed on the credits this movie would have been a hit but I was truly disappointed. Two thumbs down on this one.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Makes ones happy and upbeat to hear the tunes of ABBA!<br />Original singers as in the movie too!<br />Great music to do house chores with--hehe!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the series. It is one of the most entertaining series I've seen in a while. It has a wealthy bunch of aristocratics along with more common folks. But we all can relate to their trials and tribulations regardless of where you stand socially, culturally or economically.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the pace and the mystery of what would happen next thoughout the story. I loaned my Kindle to my stepdaughter to read, and  I never loan my Kindle to anyone!
B00002EPJH|5.0|I liked this CD a lot so I purchased it for a friend. I hope they like the music in the CD as much as we did.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this to take notes at school and checklists for chores its amazing I highly recommend!!!! use it all the time it has never failed me and it is simple and easy to use. its totally amazing get it its free!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|you laugh you cry, this may be the best thing on TV right now, words fail to tell you just how good this really is
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Two weeks after finishing the book and I am still blown away by the title! This is one of those books that I am glad to have in my library.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best thing I have ever played! I recommend it for horse lovers of any kind! AMAZING!!!!!!!
B007IQX1G4|4.0|Sad character tries to capture the past. Then she drinks a lot. Couple of car crashes later she is back where she started. Worth watching if you like Theron.
B00BFBSV72|5.0|In 2005, Sonic Jump was introduced to the mobile game library. It shared the many elements of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, of course, except for RUNNING. Yeah, that's right! Sonic doesn't run here, rather does he hop across floating platforms into the horizon (Actually, through 6 zones)! In 2007, there was Sonic Jump 2, but it was a large disappointment because it was really Sonic Jump AGAIN, except without its pointless story \\"cutscenes\\", and the bosses take more hits.<br /><br />Finally, Sonic Jump rises onto smartphones (iOS/Android), causing many people to incorrectly state it as a Doodle Jump clone. However, I have got to say that it was easily worth the risk, because Sonic Jump is AWESOME!<br /><br />This isn't the same Sonic Jump that arrived onto Java-based mobile phones back in the mid-2000s, but rather is it an all-new sequel, filled with at least 4 zones (I think they are still implementing them in via updates...), with a whopping ELEVEN acts/levels per zone! Not to mention, there's also an Arcade mode, which allows Sonic to go up to the sky as high as you possibly can!<br /><br />The basic gameplay is pretty simple, yet very addicting. You control Sonic as he automatically jumps across various levels and obstacles, and even kills any defenseless enemies in his path while curled up into a ball. Later obstacles can include projectiles, spikes, solid platforms, etc, adding in variety to what was already kinda fun.<br /><br />My only real complaint with Sonic Jump is the boss battles with series' villain Dr. Robotn....Eggman. All Eggman does is wait in the background for you to get attacked (and perhaps shoot projectiles from the distance), and then comes back into the action after a little bit. There's not too much variety in the bosses themselves, and they overstay their welcome.<br /><br />But otherwise, this is a really great Sonic game! Definitely get it for your smartphone!

0061122416|5.0|I first read this book when I was a junior in high school, aka. years ago. I remember reading this book at a very distinct point in my life. I was trying to figure out the direction of my life and what I wanted to do for the years to come. From then on this book has resurfaced at distinct moments like that, when chances required me to have the right perspective and The Alchemist helped me do that. Here's why. Because \\"To realize one's destiny is a person's only obligation.\\"    The Alchemist is a book about the Legend we all must follow in our lives. \\"Whenever we do something that fills us with enthusiasm, we are following our legend.\\" Along this path, Paulo Coelho says in The Alchemist, we're faced with four major obstacles: the thought of the impossible; the fear of abandonment by those we love; the thought of defeat we will meet on the path; and the actual fear of realizing our dream. It's these obstacles we must overcome to truly realize our 'legend.'    The Alchemist is also a book of wisdom. I never really understood this until recently. It's because it is a book of wisdom that I think I tended to gravitate towards it. At the pivotal moments in my life when The Alchemist would resurface I would find immense strength and courage from the wisdom of this book. Here are just a few of those pieces of thoughts.    \\"It's the simple things in life that make things interesting.\\"  \\"Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.\\"  \\"that a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happenning to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest life.\\"  \\"In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you.\\"  \\"The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil in the spoon.\\"  \\"It's only those who are persistent, andwilling to study things, who acheive the Master Work.\\"  \\"Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.\\"  \\"You must love the desert, but never trust it completely. Because the desert tests all men; it challenges every step, and kills those who become distracted.\\"  \\"Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.\\"    The Alchemist is one of those book that will guide you, be with you, and inspire you. One of my favorite books of all time!    ([...])

0061122092|5.0|I woke up a few days ago and walked up to my bookcase. I felt the need to read this book. It almost feels like Paulo Coelho's books have been coming to me almost predestined - I have felt an unconscious gravitation towards his books. Every time it has happened, they have coincided to events in my life. That's exactly what happened with this book. By The River Piedra I Saw Down and Wept is a book of spirituality and love, and forgiveness. Here's why this book is so important.    The story in this book involves two individuals who were once in love and they are now seeing each other again after eleven years. This has been the case in my life with the love of my life. We grew up together, we loved each other and we never had a chance to tell each other how we felt. Then, after ten/eleven years we saw each other again, and just like in this novel we have been experiencing similar moments. Just like in The Alchemist the narrative of this story has personal relevance.    This book is about the spirituality that is necessary for us to keep love alive. \\"Lovers need to know how to loose themselves and then find themselves again.\\" In the process, we must also recognize the importance of God's love, as well as our love for one another. \\"If we reject it, we die of hunger, because we lack the courage to stretch out a hand and pluck the fruit from the branches of the tree of life. We have to take love where we find it, even if that means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness. The moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us. And to save us.\\" This book shows how this process is not as expected as we'd like it to be, it has its own curveballs, but we have to able to believe and be hopeful, it's part of the process of love.    Love comes in different shades and colors. The main female character says the following:    \\"I also knew that from this moment on I was going to experience heave and hell, joy and pain, dreams and hopelessness; that I would no longer be capable of containing the winds that blew from the hidden corners of my soul. I knew that from this moment on love would be my guide - and that it had waited to lead me ever since childhood, when I had felt love for the first time. The truth is, I had never forgotten love, even when it deemed me unworthy of fighting for it. But love had been difficult, and I had been reluctant to cross its frontiers.\\"    The importance of knowing the true rewards of love cannot be denied. Coelho mentions in this book that \\"a divided kingdom cannot defend itself from its adversaries. A divided person cannot face life in a dignified way.\\" The grace needed to lead a dignified life stems from knowing the love within you, for others you love, and most of all God's love.\\"In order to have a spiritual life, you need not enter a seminary, or fast, or abstain, or take a vow of chastity. All you have to do is have faith and accept God. From then on, each of us becomes part of His path. We become a vehicle for His miracles.\\"    During this whole time, there is an underlying theme that we often take for granted. We forget the process of forgiveness, forgiveness for ourselves - for others - and for the circumstances. We forgive. We believe. We have faith and hope. And suddenly we feel God's love and move spiritually and gracefully through life. There is a conversation between the character that says exactly this.    \\"You still think that love can conquer all.\\"    \\"Well, can't it?\\"    \\"Yes, it can. But it conquers at the right time - after the celestial battles have ended.\\"    And this is what the book is all about....    [...]
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|I thought this installment of Silent Hill was great. I just love those Silent Hill iconic characters so much likes the nurses and pyramid head.
1421539691|5.0|See that face on the cover of this book? That's Near. And he just kicked some ass!<br /><br />First off, I would like to say that Black Edition was truly the best way of buying the whole Death Note series. You don't have to buy 12 skinny volumes, instead you only have to buy half of that which is only 6 books! Also, I want to say that I'm really glad that I read this series first! The old saying \\"The book is always better\\" turned out to be true (in my case at least). After finishing the last volume I decided to watch the first episode and I loved it, BUT not as much as I loved it when I was reading it. I dunno, it just seemed more suspenseful in the manga for me! (does anyone else feel this way?)<br /><br />...Now, for the review!<br /><br />Near and Light come face to face in this final volume of Death Note! The moment we've all been waiting for! But wait, where's Mello??? Oh, he reappears in this as well with a little surprise for everyone! Will Kira be revealed?! Find out in this last book!<br /><br />Sorry, I didn't want to spoil too much! My title kinda gives a spoiler alert though... sort of.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This is such a fun game I just wish there were more characters to play with. If there were more it would get 5 stars definitely
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|I enjoyed this move when it first came out and I have seen it on TV or rental since. It combines all my favorites: Star Trek, Time Travel, drama and comedy, and defeating the Borg. Great romp by many of my favorite characters and character actors. I can't think of any downside to this movie even if you are not familiar with Star Trek TNG. Resistance is Futile.
0316227706|5.0|If you want a book that will have you laughing until you cry or want to elevate your mood, this is it.  The photos are hysterical and I love that the photographer gives you their &#34;real&#34; photos along with their names in the back so you can see how different each picture turned out.  I own a Dachshund and there were a few different ones photographed and I couldn't stop laughing especially considering that mine hates the water.  These photos turn the wimpiest dog into a wolf!  Great coffee table book and makes a unique gift for the person who loves dogs and has everything.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this story!!! It was funny, happy and had a few moments where I shed a tear. Very good writing, can't wait to see the movie! I truly loved the story of when boy meets girl with issues. More realistic than other books I have read. I am a fan now!
B009M4KTEM|4.0|This is an excellent show and I can highly recommend it. Great sound and an excellent performance from Jerry and his band. I bought the CD version instead of the lossless download because I like to get the artwork (booklets, etc) that come with this set. Since I still listen to CD's and don't own an I-Pod, buying the CD version was a no-brainer for me.<br /><br />I wanted to give this set a &#34;five star&#34; rating based on the sound and performance but both sets (early show and late show) could have easily fit on two cd's instead of three. The only explanation for this must a marketing gimmick to charge more money for a 3 cd set. Too bad!!<br /><br />Luv Ya Jerry!! More music and less marketing gimmicks!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I read Safe Haven last week and fell in love with Nicholas Sparks writing. I love his movies but have never read any of his books. I really enjoyed his books and will be purchasing more.
B000W15B24|5.0|This album is very dark and moving emotionally. In my opinion many of the songs that he redid from other artist, are better then the original. I get the impression at the time of the recordings he was a dying man with regets of past deeds. The feelings that he pours in to his singing wells up and flows out of the speakers like ........you fill the rest in. Buy this album but be ready for the emotion.

B00BETX5PS|1.0|Skyfall was nothing but a glorified episode of 'Spooks' (MI5 for the benefit of my colleagues outside the UK). And while Judy Dench is a great actress she's just too old to be the film's main 'Bond girl'. A very disappointing product from Sam Mendes. Give me Casino Royale any day of the week!

B008OOYALE|1.0|I really love this game but kindle User have not been able to get the updates for the game that other platforms do. So its getting to be bit frustrating and making me not want to play anymore. I hope they fix this issue before they start losing daily players that have spent good money on it.<br /><br />I really had to change my rating of this game from 3 to 1. I'm so disappointed in this game. Before you install this game I would read all of the reviews both good and bad then make a decision. It seems to me like kindle is being use as the money pit for this company. We don't get the same updates as other platforms do and the things that we do get other platforms have for free and we have to pay for. This might be ok if it was express that kindle only has a standard edition and that's it,  but it not and when you go to your nieghbors and see what your missing out on the blow may not be so bad. I'm pretty much done with this game.
B005HSL626|4.0|Having used fruit ninja on my samsung galaxy s3, I know it can be really responsive and smooth.  But on the kindle fire HD it's a bit slow and the aesthetics are not quite what they should be.  The game is fine, however, so it's probably just the fault of the fire HD and/or the development problems for the amazon platform...
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Much to my enormous pleasure, I viewed the 2012 horror film \\"Sinister\\" and discovered one of the great works of a venerable genre. It's a masterpiece, and certainly the best horror film since the 2007 classic [[ASIN:B003TNM2K6 The Mist]]. I like to think I'm a horror film expert. There was a Friday night \\"late show\\" in Dallas during the 1970s, and I had the good fortune to watch an endless run of classic Universal horror films. Traveling through a sea of black and white, I marveled to [[ASIN:B002RXZF6C Frankenstein (1931)]], [[ASIN:B002MG2RG0 Dracula (1931)]], \\"The Wolf Man,\\" \\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\" -- you name it. I've avoided the torture porn of recent years, as true horror must have a dose of the supernatural. I loved [[ASIN:B000KE5JES The Blair Witch Project]], though hated the imitators.<br /><br />Film critics have not been kind to \\"Sinister.\\" A queasy lot, they almost always miss the boat when it comes to great horror. Like British ghost stories of the 19th century, subtle skill is necessary to pull off the tale, and \\"Sinister\\" has achieved its plateaus with unexpected success. The most important key is a good cast. Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Dalton Thompson, Vincent D'Ornofrio and James Ransone are an unusually talented team. Hawke especially gives a near-brilliant effort as a tortured writer possessed by the compulsion of solving a mystery.<br /><br />The set-up is a marvel, as Hawke plays true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt. Like Ann Rule before him, he travels to towns of notorious crimes to investigate details for his latest book. Oswalt has stumbled of late, as finances are tight, and he needs a bestseller. From desperation comes risk. Unknown to his wife and two children, he's purchased the isolated home where an entire family hung themselves from a backyard tree. In a splendid early scene, the local sheriff (Thompson) frowns on Oswalt's family as they move into the house. Familiar with the author, he says simply, \\"I want you to know this is inbad taste,\\" a classic line. Mrs. Dudley, the infamous caretaker of [[ASIN:B004WNTJP8 The Haunting]], could not have set up a more uncomfortable atmosphere.<br /><br />I love the house, a common brick structure likely built in the 1960s. It's just modern enough to lack menace, with no hanging shutters or boarded windows. Towering pines surround the property, making the living room dark even at midday. Hallways stretch for miles, as they usually do in an empty house, and there's an attic. Oswalt prefers to work at night as the subject matter he's investigating is inappropriate for his young children. There are bangs and creaks throughout the structure, later explained in terrifying detail. In the darkest corner of the attic he discovers 8mm home movies and a projector. His investigation evolves as the dusty films detail the family's murders. In the tradition of Thomas in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 classic [[ASIN:B0000WN0ZK Blow Up]], he must blow up frames from the footage to reveal clues in the hazy background.<br /><br />That's as far as I'm going, as the mystery evolves with unbearable tension. We like Oswalt, his sympathetic wife Tracy (well played by theater veteran Rylance) and his clever kids. This is a good, Bohemian family. Like Rosemary Woodhouse, Eleanor Lance, Robert Thorn and Father Karras before them, we want to protect these decent people from the growing evil engulfing their lives. The triumph of \\"Sinister\\" is we genuinely like the characters and care about their safety.<br /><br />Director Scott Derrickson has evolved and \\"Sinister\\" is his most assured work. He gave us the the surprisingly good [[ASIN:B0019CB5T8 The Exorcism of Emily Rose (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]]], though followed with the crappy remake [[ASIN:B001THAS5K The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)]]. \\"Sinister\\" is an example of his maturation and growing expertise within the medium. His screenplay, co-written with C. Robert Cargill, is ingenious. Having read quite a few true crime novels,I've often wondered if such authors as Rule, Vincent Bugliosi and John Douglas have felt a moment's guilt for making a living off the terrible fate of others. Has such investigation opened the door to unknown evils? Are they haunted by the figurative ghosts of the victims, hovering above their typewriters, perhaps exposing a disturbing thread connecting all unexpected horrors of life?<br /><br />I once worked in a Texas town where a husband killed his wife in a newly built home. A young couple soon moved into the same house and, a year later, the husband killed his wife in the front yard. The cosmic coincidence caused the house to remain unoccupied for years. It's a common enough suburban structure, residing on a block without the slightest clue of menace (sort of like that house in [[ASIN:B00471TLZS Poltergeist]]). But I wouldn't spend a single night in such a place. Like the house in \\"Sinister,\\" it stands alone, its doors better left forever locked.

B003X0B4D6|3.0|This flashlight is fun, but it's very hard to get it to respond to your voice.

B0040I09RM|5.0|Shocking, well acted. I can't believe it took me this many years to start watching the show. Each episode is a surprise waiting to be unveiled. There is never a scene that is put in there for fluff.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book is such a fun read. I first read it in High School and I consider it my introduction to Sci-Fi literature, and what an introduction it was! Fast-paced, easy-to-read and to the point!<br /><br />Card wastes no time throwing us into the life of Ender Wiggin. (Almost) every chapter was exciting, especially parts that involved The Battleroom. During the games, my internal voice would read quickly, while my mind would try to keep up, but I'd be holding my breath and on the edge of my seat. Needless to say, things could get pretty intense. Things do slow down a bit during the \\"Locke and Demosthenes\\" segments and by the ending, they just seem tacked on. Maybe they will have more of an impact in later novels, guess I'll have to find out.<br /><br />One of the gripes I have is that, sometimes, time goes by too quickly. Large chunks of time, like during training, many weeks or months will pass and apparently nothing happens to Ender. These weeks are just dismissed within a few sentences.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a stellar novel. I would recommend this book to anybody who even has a remote interest in Sci-Fi or looking for a decent action-packed story.

B00846F1YW|4.0|&#34;Mysteryville 2&#34; is pretty standard hidden object/puzzle fare, and it's not bad.

If you want some serious puzzle action, it ain't here. :D

B003MC5N28|3.0|This book was required reading for an international student that lives in our home. He read the story to us nightly so we could assist him with his English skills. We really got into the book and couldn't wait for our next session together. To our surprise, the book took a nose dive about two thirds into it. It was as if the writer had someplace to go and decided to writes anything to end it. So much care was taken to bring this community to life. Then when expectation for the twist was right around the corner...................it ended.

0857685848|5.0|Art work and accompanying text are excellent . It is interesting to look into minds of these artists and see how they interpret the evidence they have to work with to draw animals no one has every seen.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is so well done from the story line/writing to the cast and unbelievable non-stop action and special effects. This movie is the \\"Star Wars\\" of the new generation. This is the movie that proves it can be done. Even the sound track is great. I'm not even buying this copy for myself I am buying it for a young man who needs to experience it in all it's glory. If only  the new Superman movie that is in the works comes out half as good!
0439023521|1.0|Granted I only read the first few pages and the blurb, what I read was terrible.  I had to read this for a college class; but, refused based on my religious beliefs.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|It's been said that AC/DC has been remaking the same album for 30 years. If that's true than it's safe to say they have perfected it. This is their concentrated goodness. I could not imagine a better musical background for the gear grinding Ironman. This CD is guaranteed to get you to work on time provided the police don't pull you over for doing 80 in a 40 MPH zone! It's almost enough to make a child of the 80's feel young again! I would call it psychological Viagra :)
B000053GTF|5.0|This dvd was a lovely yet inexpensive gift for friends. The song titles list was impressive and so was the footage.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Meh.  It had its funny moments and some sweet ones, but this is not a movie I'd be interested in watching again.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|A good cast with Robert Duvall and a very entertaining dvd. This gift was an appreciated addition to a collection of westerns.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I was immediately impressed with their 2nd Law CD. While many compare vocals to Queen, I find this album more closely resembles U2 and Bono. Have recently ordered all their other releases and will be seeing them live in Montreal in April.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I really don't understand the critisism that people give this movie. I thought it was spectacular. The intro, I think, is one of the best ones made, and the cinematography is outstanding. It's visually captivating and the story was more personal than other Bond films. It helps the viewer get a feel for who Bond is and where he came from and I for one enjoyed that. I also love Judi Dench as M and thought that she was great here too. The villain played his part all too well. Everything came together quite nicely. Change is always good. Definitely a different Bond movie than the others, but it's one of the best ones that I've seen.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|WHY WOULD I NOT LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL SHOW. It came quick and it came BEAUTIFUL. I'm super scared to watch the last episode AAAAAAA
B00000IZOR|1.0|what matters most is that my toddler hates it . Frankly this is the first fisher price toy he refuses to play with. No battery type noise, like all contemporary toys.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|my grandma really loved watching it in theaters so my mom bought it for her for christmas and she was so happy!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Bruno Mars has done it again. I love almost every song on this cd. You can easily listen to it straight through
B004132HZS|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this baby! Everyone is beautiful and I can't wait for season three to come out!
B009K0P10K|5.0|really great show.  keeps you on the tips of your toes wanting more.  I love it and will continue watching.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|If you like Dr. Who, you will like this product. If you hate Dr. Who, you'd better be a masochist if you're watching this.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I love cars.  i will always love it and watch it frequently.  it is great for kids and family.  I am very happy i bought this movie.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Its all about blue velvet! the rest of the album is good, but blue velvet is the gem on this album
B004J4WN0I|3.0|I liked this one, although I'm not sure I really LIKE Atticus. Weird, I know. He's a bit cocky, and it seems like everything comes a little too easy for him. We'll see what he's like when I get to the next books. I love Oberon!
B001EBWING|5.0|I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS GOING TO BE 69 IN MAY, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE!  I THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO EXPERIENCE THIS MOVIE BEFORE HE DIES, WHICH COULD BE SOON, OR IN ANOTHER 10 YEARS!  OH, BY THE WAY, HE LIKED IT, HE REALLY LIKED IT!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My favorite is &quot;Night&quot; because of the realistic insect &amp; other night noises. It's just like you're camping. You can play two sounds at once like &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Campfire&quot; to really set the atmosphere.
B000NY12LO|5.0|As I began reading Nineteen Minutes I was surprised as the story went on that much of the story could have been plucked out of today's news. It was written several years ago (2006 I believe). The characters are intriguing and with Jodi's skill for pulling you in, you feel connected to each one even though they are at times almost polar opposites. Great Jodi Picoult.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter and all her friends are in love with this movie. I was glad to get it at a reasonable price.
B00447G2T8|3.0|Sure seems to be a lot of people on Amazon who love to rate all there favorite bands CD's with a 5 star review.  Lets be honest, unless that release is as good as Master of Puppets, Painkiller, Powerslave, Rust in Peace, Blackwater Park, Reign In Blood, Keeper of the Seven Keys...it's probably not a 5 star record.<br />I'm a big Helloween fan, though they aren't my favorite band.  I had high hopes for 7 Sinners after reading the fan reviews, but I don't know that this album is as good as many of there prior albums.  Something about the production sound doesn't quite sit right with me and at the end of the day I prefer Better Than Raw, Master of the Rings, The Time of the Oath, The Dark Ride, Walls of Jericho and the Keeper records to 7 Sinners.  If I could give this 3.5 stars I would because it is a good CD, just nothing standout about it.
B003QSPTAY|4.0|After watching this as a child myself, we introduced the movie to our 7 year old daughter.  It reminds me of why we liked it as children.  Love, goofs, drama, and hijinx!  She loved it.  It was nice to watch a kids' movie without wicked sarcasm, sexual innuendo, and disrespect for authority.  Highly recommend to the next generation!.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|My boys loved this movie and asked to watch it a second time before the rental was over.  Great movie for the whole family to enjoy.
B000ID37RM|5.0|A must see for any movie buff. This is an iconic picture about an important part of our US History.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I purchased this item without really worrying about anything--- but when it arrived, I gave it to it's intended recipient who is a HUGE Beatles fan, and she knew right away that ours was not a licensed edition. Beware of bootlegged copies being sold... There are ways to tell if it is bootleg, such as the print quality being dark and grainy, the names of the Beatles being misspelled (George Harrisun), covers and track listings being mismatched when printed (the binding and cover show different album names on the cd)...<br /><br />I know that this is a review for the Product, which I am sure is great when you get the REAL thing, but buyers need to know to be careful. My guess is that if you stick with buying from Amazon and shell out the little bit extra that you might save buying from a seller, you're going to get the real deal.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is highly recommended.  I am a young reader of 13 years and I could still respected  this book as if someone with much wisdom. Definitely worth the time.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Exactly as described. No scratches or issues. Arrived within days of ordering, and a very good price as well. Great!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow. I can't even begin to describe the craziness and the emotion that fills your entire body as you read this. I couldn't put it down. I want to keep reading and reading his books. They are seriously inspirational.<3

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I'm a sucker for animated movies.  I always have been and probably always will be.  I'm 44 and still believe in Santa, The Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and The Sandman.  Ok, ok, I know they are not real, not something I can see or touch, but I do believe in the spirit each of them represent!<br /><br />This movie, from the youngest to the young at heart, will bring back that spirit for an hour and half, at the very least.<br /><br />So, watch it, enjoy it...and believe!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I am glad that I own this season, it is a show you will want to watch more than once.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A friend told me about the book so I bought the first book could not put it down so I finished the first book and then I had to buy the second book and was loving it even more the was done with that one to so of coarse I had to purchase the final book and I so wish there was a forth book keep them coming oh Christian grey
B00B935SUY|5.0|excellent portrayal of the heart of modern rock/pop recording with a delightful twist at the end. Dave Grohl & co. rock on many different levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its so much fun on my device im 2 place it is really cool to play if your<br />Bored i got it right now were im in rome so cool but there somthing i got<br />To say is maybe it would be cool to turn in the game so ya love the game<br />«3;)
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The first part of the film was very exciting--then it started to lag a bit and picked up near the end--but the moral of the story and the acting were great.  Being in the airline industry isn't a plus when watching movies like this, because there were so many &#34;unfactual sins&#34; created by the producers that stuck out like a sore thumb.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|PLEASE fix 3-16 or tell me how to beat the level I've tried everything but it's still not working PLEASE hurry and fix
B0087IT8LO|5.0|I saw this movie three times at the movie theater! And finally I can get it in DVD. A friend practically dragged me to watch this movie(I did not want to watch it when I saw the trailer), but then I saw it and absolutely loved it. I have never been a fan of foreign or indie movies, but this movie completely changed my point of view.<br />I laughed the whole movie and felt great at the end!! Great story, great movie!! I would have given it the academy ward for best picture!!<br />Wow wow wow I can't say it enough, everyone I have taken to see this movie loves it as well. Buy it right now!!
B00773YOB4|5.0|You can never go wrong buying new stuff from Bonnie Raitt.  She is in a class by herself and has certainly established a unique style of her own.  Don't miss this new album.
0062082353|5.0|great book. I've not yet finished it. Thusfar, it is a good read. It brings together the different perspectives of his personal life, military life, and society.  He puts into place the realities of what it takes to maintain freedom.  It is not how many kills he made.... it is about how many lives he saved !
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Excellent novel,<br /> The characters are well developed and stay with you long after finishing the story. Enough mystery to keep you guessing. The disturbing descriptions of the orphans lives are tragically real.
B0012ELLB0|5.0|There is a reason why this group made such great music.... they were awesome musicians! I play the piano and purchased the sheet music for their work.  Incredible and complex music that they made look very easy.  Their sound was unique and message clear.
B00B8ESWAM|5.0|If you like your music with a verse, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, ending, you may not like, \\"The Master\\".  So many reviews in the press seem to have missed the really big theme and call it a character piece.  It is a character piece, but it is so much more.  It's my opinion that Anderson leaked it was about Scientology to throw you off the true path and the true message.  And while there are similarities, it is not remotely about that.  It's about something much bigger and many people won't like it.  There are lots of themes to consider, like they are both the same men internally, but with different plans (or lack of) to manage the expectations of the external world (my favorite part is they both know they drink poison, even if they pretend it isn't).  There is the very clear implication they have had a physical relationship, but even if that is true, it is really not central to the message.    Here is the secret.  At around 1:40 mark, at the Phoenix Conference for, \\"The Cause\\", notice the sign on the wall (visible for 3 seconds) is actually a Rorschach.  The next six minutes of the film is what it is all about, and you get about 2,500 years of human history crammed into that small slice of time.  It's better to see it yourself, but if you don't want to figure it out, read the next paragraph.    The message is that all religion is bulls*** and you can see whatever you want into it.  The rules will be changed by those running the con.  Men who don't even believe will fight you, or kill you, just to preserve a place where they belong.    There is much, much more, but you should see it yourself and discover all those little gems.
B000UBN22M|5.0|One of the greatest rock-n-roll bands ever.<br /><br />Sad rumor - there lawyer screwed them out of all their royalties.<br /><br />It is great fun to listen to... it is one of my goto albums while riding my motorcycle.
0345525558|3.0|This book was nominated for my book club.  It was enjoyable but very different and sparked diverse conversations regarding the meaning of flowers and issues with foster care programs plus being immature and pregnant.
B0013AWUPE|5.0|Brain Salad Surgery was a trend setting album.  The title gives you the idea of what's in store for you while listening.  The boys had a little fun with technology but never lost sight of their raw talent.  It is great fun to listen to... it is one of my goto albums while riding my motorcycle.
1400052181|5.0|I recommended this book for book club.  Our very diverse membership had great comments and everyone enjoyed reading it.  We are all women and learning the historical aspect of HeLa cells.  We all felt indebted to Henrietta Lacke and thank the author for telling her story. We also thank her family for sharing their memories.
B009UNH0EM|4.0|works great. I use it in my car for when my blue tooth is low on charge. I just plug it in while I am at work.
1589946006|4.0|One of the nicest things about the &#34;Call of Cthulhu&#34; card game are the Cthulhu-shaped playing pieces. This bag contains 30 replacement/supplemental mini-Cthulhu idols intended to be used as counters for &#34;Call of Cthulhu&#34; but perfectly usable as miniatures for any other RPG or board game. (I personally plan on using some of the smaller ones to replace the little green houses in my Monopoly set.) The sculpts are detailed and very well done especially for this price range. No, these aren't Cthulhu idols that will rival larger handcrafted collectables in terms of quality but they are far better than we have any right to expect for this price range.<br /><br />I'd like to comment on a few things that might not be obvious.<br /><br />1)The coloring of the idols in no way resembles the official photo that Fantasy Flight Games uses to advertise these miniatures. The photo looks as though the idols would be almost marble, yet the actual coloring is a very drab olive green not too far removed from the toy soldiers that used to come 100 to a box in the backs of comic books. There is an ink wash in black that brings out the details. I was honestly surprised to see how much darker the idols were than in the photo. The idols are possibly paintable, but see below.<br /><br />2)The idols are made out of slick plastic which could present some problems with melting after a while. Plastic similar to this is often difficult to paint well.<br /><br />3)The idols come in just two sizes, just like in the &#34;Call of Cthulhu&#34; game. They are not &#34;various-sized.&#34;<br /><br />Lovecraft fans (and even some Derleth fans) are going to be rightfully happy to snatch up these critters while they last.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it...It is just like the bingo i play on Facebook. Its bingo so it is all good. I would recommend this whole heartedly
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it! It was a refreshing read. The way the novel was written made it impossible to put the book down. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank ocean is definitely the leader of the new school Neo soul movement.  His music is beyond a genre title to be honest. Fresh, innovative and nostalgic soul music with integrity. This album is most incredible! No letter,  no controversy could stop this album from being crowned an absolute masterpiece. Channel orange is timeless and breath taking!  5 stars.  Cop it now!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE This game it is so different.  I really enjoy playing it.  My granddaughter find it hard, but they are still young,
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|My wife and I were late comers to the series and appreciated the ability to catch up online, especially convenient was having access to the current season.  Something other providers offer sporadically and never the ones you want.<br /><br />The quality was excellent.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|I do enjoy seeing my favorite characters come to live on TV but It is just a little too gory and a few too many scenes featuring naked women. In “Garden of Bones” I think a saw another set of boobs about ever 3-4 minutes, and can't say that I found them necessary. If I had not read the books and loved them I would not watch this series. I love the story but find the nudity a little overdone.
B004GYY714|4.0|I can find just about anything on radio (and all over the world) via this app.  Various types of music (I especially like opera), and talk radio (sports, politics, etc...)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a very fun game and if you like games like temple run you will love this game.
B000W967UQ|5.0|Discworld is just an awesome creation. Every book is better than the next. I hadn't read this one in a long time. This was my first read as an ebook and I have to admit I really missed the traditional placement of the footnotes. The kindle format makes them a bit inconvenient.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Loved the quick read. Was day to smash out some pages while in airports and traveling over the past week or so
030758836X|5.0|This is one of the creepiest books I have ever read in my life.  The third part of the book (it's divided into 3 sections) I finished in a marathon session because I had to know how this story would end. HIGHLY recommended.  I found this book on a Best of 2012 list and would say that it's up there in my top-ten of all time. It's such a dark, creepy story...once I got about halfway through the book (SPOILER) I really felt for the character Nick, and was very afraid of the character Amy.  And towards the end I just couldn't wait to see how it would all finally come together.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a reminder of how America rose to such great heights through the great compassion of our warriors.  In the middle of some of the most savage of wars the elite of American fighting personnel show the care in protecting noncombatants in the attempts to further the spirit that made America great.  Then the reminder of the sacrifice and commitment to the team concept for its survival.  Through the pain, and loss of such amazing Americans, you walk away wanting to find a way to serve your neighbor and country the way it is demonstrated in this great book.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Works like a charm and is pretty loud considering it's on my Nexus 7. If you like a variety of white noise to choose from this fits the bill.
B0095P31L6|2.0|Grandsons watch (9 and 5) watched and liked OK. I found the movie dark and depressing and a fun movie to watch.
B006MOW98E|4.0|John Green is a great author, and I bought this book when I saw his name on it. All three stories are good and fun - a very enjoyable holiday read!
B000VUCIZO|4.0|The history of the \\"Digital Age\\" will be taught in schools one day. While this book may never be required reading, it's a must for anyone interested in the beginnings of modern computer culture. Woz's book reads like a story he tells, with plenty of time-warping, side stories, and plenty of personality. The inside scoop on his relationship with Jobs, HP, and Captain Crunch are illuminating. Not an easy read, but a great reward for anyone willing to put in the time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is an excellent writer. He told an incredibly sad story with grace and sensitivity. Have some Kleenex on hand while you read this book.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is a fun and easy to use application that you can keep on your Kindle for cleaning up, modifying, or enhancing photos you take using the Kindle camera.  Can also modify any other images - downloaded pics and things like that. Fun and easy for a novice like me to use in minutes.
B00338QENI|5.0|It tells the story that you never hear and how said that after all this time, the Lacks Family still is not able to get their health care paid for - after all they have contributed...  sad.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Ethan Hawke is, at best, a mediocre talent.<br /><br />He comes off in this film not as a desperate, struggling writer, but as a guy with an over developed sense of entitlement. The writing is boring and and the direction seems confused, both making the plot suffer.<br /><br />The woman playing the wife is beautiful and delivers a convincing performance, at least next to Hawke, and the kids did a great job in their limited exposure.<br /><br />If you have to see it, rent- don't buy...

B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|God movie for chill factor, the ending was dismal and depressing though. Kinda a \\"I watched all that for this?\\" type moment...
0374214913|4.0|First I must disclose that I listened to this book on audio. But whether listened to or read, it is a captivating story full of wit and whimsy and creativity. But most of all, it is a story of love for books and the written word, something that is dear to my heart.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Cause I don't ussually buy expensive apps, but I like have a few movies arround so that I can entertain my neices in my car.  This a great app to see if I nn to try and hook up the wires or do I have enough power to get to that nex stop.<br /><br />T. Darwin
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had the worst ending ever.  It ruined the book for me.  I was enjoying it prior to that.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I played the free game but I love the paid game even though you only get like three or four more blades.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I enjoyed this book on my Kindle.  It was worth the read, especially if you are an Apple fan.  Well written and easy to get through in a weekend.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my Samsung Galaxy 3 after it wouldn't download onto my LG Optimus.  It is an awesome and challenging game.  The puzzles keep you guessing and I like the fact that the puzzles are random so that you can't catch onto a rhythm.  I am so addicted.  I have already acquired all of the blades.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm so happy to be reading Stephen King again!  Been a huge fan from his start but lost interest when the stories became<br />too long and drawn-out.  I kept thinking, get to the point!  Sorry, SK.  I'm loving 11-22-63, we recently started a book club at work and this book was selected and I couldn't be happier.  It's classic King and a great storyline to boot.<br />P.S. - first book I'm reading on my new Kindle Fire which is a plus since the 'book' is quite large to be carrying around, etc.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Holy cow did I cry!!  I can't believe some of the things this girl has made it through!  Be prepared with a box of tissues!  But it is a must read!!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to the end. It's sure to be a nail biter for those who expect a typical 007 flick. This one will surprise you...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was AWESOME!!!!! Love the hunger games!!!! peeta is my favorite! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A fascinating blend of humor and history.  This engaging story is reminiscent of Douglas Adams; looping tales and multiple points of view, seasoned with a dry wit that will make you laugh aloud.  I look forward to other works by this author.
0547848412|5.0|Great book! I was shocked by the story. It is amazing what humankind is capable of. The book is much, much better than the movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great follow up to the book one if the hunger games trilogy. I couldn't put it down!!! The twist in the last chapter I never saw coming. Can't wait to start reading book three!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's really cool, but it doesn't even have a quarter of the stuff that<br />minecraft on the computers does. It doesn't even have a hunger bar.<br />The maps are really small too.  On most worlds there's<br />like no diamond.
1457514508|5.0|The members of the Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club meets in the park every afternoon to let their dogs romp, drink an afternoon cocktail, and most importantly gossip about the neighbors. It seems like a typical southern style community with the young and the old alike living their normal lives, but behind closed doors each has their own dirty little secrets. The question is: who gets theirs aired first?  This is a fast-paced novel that will keep you guessing right up to the very last page. I would recommend it to anyone who likes revenge, mystery, and whodunnit novels.
0385535147|5.0|I loved this book.  I read all of the Grisham novels and this is in my top 3 favorites.  What a great twist and elaborate tricks.  I really enjoyed it.
1582701709|5.0|I've seen this video change so many lives, including mine. Some people dislike it. They think it focuses on greed and lacks spiritual influence but I think it's what you make it. If you want to change your life, attitude etc, this is a great first step.  djd

B002ZG993Q|3.0|(SPOILERS) Recently viewed it again and don't remember why I bought it.  I think it's because George Clooney is good in it, though I disliked the story.  One of the opening sequences is George Clooney's character shooting his friend and lover in the back - you don't often see a movie star shooting a woman in the back, so I liked that the film made it crystal clear from the beginning that the George Clooney character was doomed.  Now it's coming back to me, I think it's a morality tale, live by the sword, die by the sword, at the end, the lead had plenty of money and a beautiful woman who loved him and he died just as a decent life was within his reach.  So, though I disliked the story (I hated the violence against the woman character at the story's beginning and it colored the entire story for me in a negative way), I think it was told well, i.e., told within a morality frame Americans like me like.  In real life, with this scenario, the lead would have survived and lived to a ripe old age with many children and grandchildren surrounding him; only in film stories do villains sometimes get their comeuppance.  In the real world they seem to live well and prosper, but we audiences so like our illusions, the simple rules many of us were raised with - do not lie, or cheat or steal, do onto others as you would have them do onto you.  Those rules that seem fainter and fainter in the world around us as we age, and those rules we miss more and more as we read world events in our newspapers.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I thought it would enable me to connect to my LAN but the plug on my computer was only there to support an external monitor.
B000RJO578|4.0|great police officer character and his sidekick, very funny, loaded with great English actors.  It amazed me when I first saw the film how many middle age, middle class criminals were in this story; you don't often see this demographic as law breakers, so it was very funny that way too.  My first Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movie - I went looking for their projects after this.  Great actors.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This was on my daughter's wish list so I bought it for her for Valentine's Day.  She was happy to get it!
B000MKD9P6|3.0|The leads were great, most workers have experienced at least one boss from hell and so can relate to the premise, but Meryl Streep is a star and the producers made her seem demanding rather than monsterous.  Had she yelled at any time (as you might find in a real work situation), it would have placed the character over the edge, but she was written and Ms. Streep delivered her impossible demands in such an offhand, almost depressed sort of way, that it really toned the character down alot.  My favorite part of the story was the clothes and the shoes, compared to some of the treatment I've seen in offices (especially when I first started as an office worker), the Anne Hathaway character was treated decently enough - considering the environment she was in (fashion), and her initially poor dress sense, she was treated very well.  Found it unbelievable that any recent college grad would attempt to get a job, without having her hair professionally cut, and without wearing a business suit to an interview - 100% unbelievable; filmmakers wanted to do a before and after, but if the before is not believable, the after doesn't matter.  Liked the film well enough, bought it and re-watch it occasionally, it is amusing; not a gem, but not bad.
0399226907|5.0|This book was in the wish list of a friend so I bought it for her shower.  She was happy to get it!
B0018OIK0E|3.0|(SPOILERS) not scary, more amusing, a zombie comedy.  Good acting, liked it after I understood what it was trying to do.  Funny but not in a laugh out loud sort of way, more a story of working class people and their tensions within the backdrop of a zombie outbreak (is there such a thing as a zombie outbreak - whatever).  Believable interpersonal tensions of everyday ordinary people experiencing a zombie epidemic.  Would give it 3 and a half stars.  Bought it before I knew what it was about, and didn't regret spending the money after viewing the film.
B001AGNRYO|5.0|I used to own a promo copy of this record back in the early 1970's. I was introduced to Nick Drake's music by some folks at a local record shop in Santa Monica, CA. I always thought that the Pink Moon album was very special. I especially liked Nick Drakes guitar style as it was very unique. As far a the quality of that original pressing goes, I can't remember that it was either good or bad, but it was at least decent. It somehow vanished over the years, but I have always been looking to pick up another copy. That quest is now over.<br /><br />As far as this reissue goes, I can't see where the original pressing would have anything over this. The quality of this pressing is outstanding. The vinyl is extremely quiet. The packaging is top notch and with attention to detail. Way better than the original that I had.The fidelity is superb. The sticker says that it was pressed in Germany.  For those looking to add this to their collection, I high recommend this reissue.
B0056BU3I2|3.0|pretty good action film with hunk Vin Diesel and alot of other gorgeous men (and some pretty ladies); weakest points to me, (1) why oh why do villains leave a torture scenario en mass leaving one or two inept torturers behind so the heros can escape (Lethal Weapon, Taken, and this film), and (2) 100% unbelievable that Dwayne Johnson would join the heist or let the criminals go in the end - just so not happening.  He may have helped them get less time, but let them walk, not.  Favorite part - the beautiful baby boy who played Nico, his smile as he was being put to bed, gorgeous baby.  I'd give this film 3 and a half stars and I liked it well enough to buy it.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|I loved it! As a former counselor my self I could really relate to the characters.. An excellent choice if I do say so myself.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|He knows how to structure a film story and is one of the best film storytellers I've had the pleasure of viewing.  May he tell many, many more for our viewing pleasure.  Thank you sir.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing to be where he has been and to see what he's seen. This country will miss him, but we should be proud that men like this are still being discovered. His tenacity is something we're born with. God be with his family.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I'm not one to leave feedback or reviews, but this CD is so good that I needed to. Very rarely do I ever enjoy an entire album, even from my most favorite artists, but I can listen to this entire album and enjoy every minute. Great catchy lyrics and excellent rhythm and beats make for a winner!<br /><br />I will admit, I have my favorite tracks on this CD. Among them are (in no particular order): Gorilla, Natalie, Moonshine, When I Was Your Man, and Treasure. But they are all good.<br /><br />Keep it up Bruno Mars!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|awesome movie, down to earth and touching, i don't usually write reviews but this one deserves one. i will buy this movie
1439152802|5.0|A great book,  wonderful story with great twists<br />Kate morton is a wonderful storyteller<br />A must read<br />the ending will shock you
B004GJXQ20|3.0|The dialogs are nice and engaging, the characters are interesting and there's a great amount of mistery involved. However, there are passages that lingers too much. It also looks like the autor doesn't have the whole story framed, as if he is just inventing characters and still deciding what to do with them.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|If you love the original sci-fi movies, then see them as they were meant to be seen-clearly. Picture and sound quality is wonderful!
B000R7I3LY|4.0|I didn't know most of the musics, but that was a good surprise. I enjoyed the lirics and her voice is very soft.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Psychoanalysts would have a great time analyzing the characters in this book!!!--Whew.  Well written, certainly thought-provoking.  Not sure about the ending.....
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is always amaising. This is just Adele being Adele. She is quite nervous and outspoken when talking to the audience. Totally confident and just perfect when singing. Amaising. The song are most from 21 album, very little from 19.
B004SKLD9A|1.0|I can't understand so many rave reviews for a movie that had me bored or laughing out loud. There is so much wrong with it that it would take to long to write them all down but how about these (SPOILER ALERT) that are not in sequential order:<br /><br />1.  When Preston (and others) are on the med, they're supposed to feel nothing. yet their voices have tone and reflect anger (a lot), fear, etc, etc.<br /><br />2.  The son was never off of his meds, yet he discovers his dad's cache and gives the meds back to cover up the crime.<br /><br />3.  The dog is somehow kept when every movement in the city is observed? Preston lives in what is clearly an apartment-type of building (no gardens or yards) and yet the neighbors never hear a thing? And just where does the pooch \\"go\\"?<br /><br />4.  My second favorite glaring error...the dog is licking the daughter's hand when she's clearly at school...WHAT? How did the dog get there without being shot? Every movement of the school kids is monitored and yet she was able to nonchalantly walk in with a FORBIDDEN object??<br /><br />5. And my absolute favorite glaring error...drum roll, please...everytime Preston shoots a group of soldiers/enforcers/whatevers, it's never just one or two but at least a dozen...and they're all positioned to be as good a target as possible. Not only that, but while he's wiping out the first few, the rest hang around until it's their time to die. Surely if you have super-professionals like the clerics, then the rest of the forces are going to be reasonably well-trained, too, not just waiting for their turn to spew blood. The final scene had me laughing like a hyena it was so ludicrous.<br /><br />This was an interesting premise for a movie, but the end result could only be believed if you're under the age of 8. FWIW, I usually like Christian Bale (and looooove Sean Bean), but no one could possibly save this piece of dreck.
B007IYWY3C|3.0|I like the indie style of Florence and really enjoyed her albums, but the unplugged version is kind of shrill. Some songs might give you headache.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I loved everything except the end of the season. Maggie Smith is the best! Poor Lord Grantham - he never seems to get his way. Hooray for Edith trying to make something worthwhile of her life.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!  Once you pick it up you can't put it down.  I can't wait to see the movie (even though it can't be any better than the book)!  Definitely a must read.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|The turntable seems fine for the price, purchased to replace an old Kenwood turntable.  Have not used it enough to give proper evaluation.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Shadow was a great friend to me when I needed him, even if I didn't know it at the time. This book gave me back my joy of reading and put gas in my tank when I was running on fumes. It's a great tale, well handled, with memorable characters and wonderfully understated humor. It's hard to say much more without spoiling the magic trick. If you're on the fence, just do yourself a favor and read this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is by far one of the best series ever! I can watch the previous episodes all the way to the new episodes and not get bored like many of the other shows I watch! Well written, characters are interesting, and my wife loves Daryl! That ladies and gentlemen means foreplay.  :)
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|We watched this movie with our family, and we were deeply touched.  I wish there would be more movies like this made.  SOUL SURFER!  Stamina, dedication, love.  WE LOVE IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little girl loves this game.  Its fun and easy for her to do.  She is three years old and loves taking care of her horse beauty.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|Excellent novel that has Rebus working cold cases, and it will keep you wondering if this time Rebus has it wrong until the very end...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game ifs absolutely amazing I have played it for long now and I love it.the graphics are very good and it is fantastic
B007SGM084|1.0|The storyline is so weak, it overshadows any reading enjoyment that could be had from the saucy parts of the book. And even those are not very imaginative. I was unable to force myself to finish reading this book, and that hardly ever happens.
B0014H32MG|5.0|pissed off with nothing to lose makes an awesome novel. Throw in steven king and you get amazing, loved it!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|The flashbacks got annoying after a while, but they helped set up the characters and story for the next books. This series is going to be epic.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|This is the only reader that I have found that will open large (100+ pages) word docs. Also renders clearer images.
B002V6RB1C|4.0|Sad ending, great movie!! Movie on Prime looked real sharp and sound was good, I think this movie was made a the high of Newman's career!
B000RO9VJK|4.0|This book is helpful for any small business owner. It will help you look at your business in a new light and give you a method to grow your business.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Good pro-marriage message to see in today's culture.  Did not undermine the difficulty of the struggles or the frustrations people face.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Clear and easy to use on the Kindle Fire. A daily source of inspiration. A free app for the kindle fire that will change your life.
B0037QYTN8|5.0|absolutely couldn't be happier with this book. it's one of those few books you read that you have to put it down from time to time to just think before you continue. it gives you so much wisdom and can really change your life for the positive and better if you allow yourself to view things differently than society tells us. love it and anything from marcus!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|harder and easier at the same time than temple run 1. Very glad they let you keep your coins between runs though or I'd never get anywhere.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Really enjoyed book two, will not go on,  had enough for now.  Somehow, it was so unreal.  I would like to try it but will skip it for now.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|The third season of Downton Abbey, which takes place in the early 1920s, has some good times -- chief amongst those Matthew and Mary's long-awaited wedding -- and some very bad times indeed, which I won't go into here. The acting continues to be good and I agree with most of the plot points, but of course there are a couple of really bad situations that I don't want to give away but that most people have probably heard about anyway. The ending of this season was far darker than that of season two, so I'm hoping there are happier times ahead in season four. Production values are good and the costumes are sumptuous.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I saw the movie, didn't do the book justice.  Book is very good, and one of Sparks successes. To real for lots of ladies.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is fun, interesting, provocative, and emotional.  I've been listening to it over and over for the past few days.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really just started with &#34;Downton  Abby&#34; this year,  so needed past seasons  DVD  to catch up.  Great story and can't wait until Season 4 starts!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Kept my attention. So sexy and sad at the same time. Cannot wait for the next one! The author did great. I found myself feeling like I was right there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I tried to play minecraft on my laptop but it would be very laggy, I have a pretty simple gateway laptop since I only use it for my papers and cases for college and a few simple games. I thought I would miss out on all the fun people are having until I found \\"Minecraft Pocket Edition\\"!! I play it on my sisters kindle fire and I always have fun! It runs very smooth and will keep you hooked for hours! Lol it's very addicting so be careful! Sadly it doesn't have all the features like the PC version but for $7 it's not bad at all. 5*!!!!
B009NNG202|1.0|Though this movie had Dustin Hoffman, the plot was terrible and made no sense.  Dont waste you time.  You can consider the announcement on the box &#34;international box office hit&#34; to be false.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was great! I was hooked immediately and couldn't put it down! I flipped out a couple of times and am just speechless! The writing, attention to detail, and story is superb. I could do without all the necessary cursing, but enjoyed the back and forth storytelling. I will definitely be saving this novel to my favorites.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Works wonderful!  Fits kindle perfectly, stores easily and isn't bulky!  Fits inside the computer case for easy transport and use.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I have to admit, I started to get bored. Then suddenly!!! Wow,what a great book. The movie was very different. Happy I always read the books first.
B005ZMUXDC|2.0|The streaming feature is good, but I cannot play the movie on my Apple TV using the iPad, only through my iMac.  This is inconvenient and doesn't make any sence to me. The Apple TV quality of the movie is not HD, another mystery to me.
030758836X|1.0|I read this book and as a consequence wasted a few good hours that I will never get back.  One star is being generous and only because 0 or negative stars are not available.  I fail to see why this book has gotten such good ratings.<br /><br />Overall the book takes twists and turns, mostly unbelievable, with characters completely unlikeable, that do not add to the story or the plot.  The author writes well, which is the only reason I kept reading, hoping for closure.  And while there is a &#34;sort of closure&#34;, it is so contrived that it just left me feeling very disappointed and irritated that I spent this much time with this book.  After a while I felt that I was in a late night commercial.  That is, that I would get to a point in the ending of the book expecting it to be wrapped up, but no &#34;Wait there is more&#34;.<br /><br />I can not recommend this book at all, and have suggested to my book club not to choose this book.  Two other people in the group had also read it, and they indicated that I was being too kind in my criticism. :-)<br /><br />Disclamer:  I did not buy this book, but read the e-book on my Kindle from the library.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|The same characters, many years older, doing the same amusing things with each other.  If you liked American Pie, you'll like this too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game ever! it works great on the kindle fire and never glitches, you can upgrade it easyly and it is very addicting.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I would rather buy the digital copy from iTunes.  Ultraviolet is horrible.<br /><br />This movie was very enjoyable.  I am ready to watch it again and again.  Just not on untraviolet.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|That is one creepy movie.  I just rented it on Instant Video tonight and the home movie scenes gave me the willies.  There's just enough given so you understand what's going without it being ridiculously, over-the-top gory.  Just enough is left out to make you wonder what will happen next, at least until the understated scary parts sneak up on you. The wife got on my nerves, the writer, he was really into his book to get into his subjects' heads like that, and his kids were involved whether they wanted to be or not.  The house and the dead took charge of everything almost immediately. I'd love to watch this movie again. Moral of this movie?  Be careful what you want to write about, because it might make you the subject matter instead.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|What a depressing life Pat lives, way to go Oscar award. Making everyone believe that a 7 :00 murder/suicidal/mentally ill story is Oscar worthy. Potential buyers beware, not uplifting or beneficial. Only shrinks, lonely, and apathetic people should buy this. If the movie proves better I will be shocked. I am glad the book is over and for Pat the character I wish a world of Better, I am glad this book is out of my hands and head.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Great item, great service!  Thanks for a great item and the speedy turnaround.  Really appreciate the great item and service!
B00BESIKWM|2.0|Weak story, irrelevant action, blaze acting.  Some of the effects were chilling (like the spider-thing, ugh), but mostly replayed or overplayed.  Oh well.
B004GCPJDQ|3.0|No difficulties in getting the battery pack to fit my mouse. Placing the mouse on the charging station immediately switches the LED light to flashing green indicating that the batteries are charging.<br /><br />As per other reviews, the battery percentage listed in OSX does not appear to be correct. I have left the mouse on the charger for 8+ hours and have not noticed a considerable difference in the battery charge levels. I have been able to use the mouse without error or connection drops despite not knowing how much of a charge the batteries actually have.<br /><br />The plastic on the charger station is of poor quality. All plastic can be scratched, but Mobee really should have taken into account that the magic mouse is a harder plastic. There are visible scratches on my charging station after only a few days of use. This probably wont cause any degradation in charging performance, but as with all products I use with my MacBook, I prefer them to be of high quality.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I liked the ending and the wrap-up of the circle.  Yeah, it was obvious who was what and so on, but I liked it and the little boy?  OH MY GOODNESS!!  Just wanted to eat him up - too amazing and cute.  JGL's make-up was distracting though and a bit odd.  I know why they did it, but it creeped me out because it looked like something was wrong with his face.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I was concerned It would hinder texting, but found,...amazingly so,... It made it easier. No joke. It improved the function of the sensitive touchscreen. Plus made the phone near bullet proof. Excellent product. I'd recommend to anyone clumsy
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A nice tie-in for all of the previous films featuring the super heroes.  Scarlett's character still being the weakest and least needed.
0345529057|5.0|Haven't finished reading all of the books but god, between the books and the show this is my nerdgasms. Love the story/writing.
B008OOYALE|2.0|this game is ok is all I'm going to say about it but Dragonvale is much better with more dragons-habitats-buildings-and decorations a must have for the Kindle Fire
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It took me until almost the end to really get to the point where I couldn't out it down. Although I seemed to be bored at parts in the beginning, it was completely worth reading! The end of this story was fantastic and the events that took place were unexpected! It was suspenseful and I had to keep reading until the very end. The ending was so good that I immediately read it again. Loved this story and I loved that Nicholas Sparks took a different turn in his writing.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|great is the only thing that can describe this game better than all the other dragon games by far u should get this
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was so attached to this book I read it in a day.<br />The end seemed a little rushed but overall riveting.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Very entertaining, worth the extra for HD. If action/adventure movies are your thing, I definitely recommend Skyfall. Plot-driven, occasionally tense, with a dramatic ending.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I never liked history in school but am thrilled with both of Ken Follet's<br />trilogy books. and am looking forward to the next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a book all book lovers would love.  It's f2f in f2f nullifying xxx muggy c k c I ouc kcal it xxx lucky
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is pretty entertaining. It's easy to figure out how to play it, and the difficulting progresses to keep you interested. Horse lovers will adore this game.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|this movie was more than i expected; which is to say i expected it to simply be an action film. it had a genuine and interesting plot with some interesting twists. i recommend watching it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I got this app went I frist got my kindle a year ago.It works great for me I use it every day
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|this movie literally had the identical plot as PA3. and i don't mean the same theme (as all the PA movies will obvi have the same general theme), i mean the exact same plot. they're clearly no longer trying to put out a quality product; only cashing in the success of the first movie.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I had been wanting a Kindle for a long time. Finally decided to get one. Needed a case for it. Found my favorite color. Love it.
B0081L391C|2.0|Although there are some parts which are funny. Overall the movie has a terrible story line, terrible punch lines and terrible acting overall. I would not even recommend this movie to my enemies.
B008133MDK|5.0|I bought the Amazon download of this episode, because I wasn't interested in the complete Season 2! My thought was that I might be able to download the episode onto a disk, for my own use of course. Is there anyone out there that could help me with that? Realizing that I am an old timer that has not grown up with the technology! Thank you!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a solid author who our family collects and reads each title, this was a great addition to the collection.
B009EE5SQ4|5.0|This is an awesome movie! There aren't many that start so exciting, finish exciting & keep it going through the middle!! The special effect are great & the acting is great. A true gem of a movie & would give it 10 stars if I could.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I love movies from amazon because you can store them in your video library for easy viewing anytime you wish.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|This movie is alright I suppose. I prefer things to be a bit more spooky. This movie gave me the impression good (okay bad) things were about to happen yet never did.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very very addictive good game.we all enjoyed the game adults and children very similar to temple run so if you enjoyed that you will love subway surfers.
B007P06DJK|5.0|Saw the documentary on PBS and went looking for my CD of Graceland. Horror of horrors it was missing. So, I decided to get the Anniversary addition. Timeless music and love the cultural exchange that music has a tendency to do. Music knows no borders and is a language all humans understand.
1616550414|5.0|This book is a must-have for an Zelda fan!<br />It has way more content that what I have expected. Half of the book focuses on Skyward Sword, but the other half goes through all the Zeldas and the storyline between them.<br /><br />The quality is top-notch. The cover looks and feels really nice and sturdy.<br />Is heavy. Is a book to have at home, not to travel with.<br />The pages are high quality and it comes with lots of artwork.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Heard this song &#34;Little Talks&#34; on a trip to Tucson, twice in one day. Since I was traveling through I didn't catch the name or the stations I'd heard it on. Tried figuring it out for two weeks upon my return home to Wisconsin. Finally set my car radio to continuous scan since scouring playlists for likely stations in Tucson left me confused. All I knew was female vocalist with a Celtic feel to the music. Finally heard the song on the radio and discovered Monsters and Men. Their videos are spectacular and almost have a early Beatles vibe to the animation used. Worth the search and love the music.
1451627289|5.0|What an amazing story.  This is a love story, ladies and gentlemen, so don't go thinking it's sci-fi or fantasy... thought I'll admit there are some elements of both of those.  This story is about time travel, and how it can bring two people together, whether they like it or not.  And... SPOILER!!!! ...the hobo outside the portal will blow your mind.  What a trip!  Buy this book right now and read it.  Do it.
B0067EKY7M|3.0|Its an OK film. Love the premise and the fact that it transcends cultural stereotypes. Better seen on DVD but probably not a keeper.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|wish it didn't have all the Facebook pop ups that distract him.  Caught on quickly and hasn't gotten bored yet
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time, with little elements poping up on every vieweing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Read this with my book club.  As an attorney, I thought this was a well written book.  The courtroom and grand jury dialogue was some of the most realistic I have seen in these books.  Well done...loved the whole thing.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A good hidden object game but it seems to end far too quick. Was a surprise to have to pay when you entered the house
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  We enjoyed it and look forward to season 4.  We watched Season 3 again on PBS and realized there was more to the story than on the English version.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|What a depressing Bond!<br /><br />He is definitely getting over the hill.<br /><br />No sense of humour, unlike previous Bonds.<br /><br />This one is particularly grim, as is the current M.<br /><br />And the current Q, he is even worse.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was inspiring, informative and entertaining.  A true story of courage, determination, sacrifice.  I could see ways to apply soe of these concepts to my own life regarding working hard to achieve goals beyond most people's imagination.<br /><br />I was not knowledgeable about the sport of endurance running and how the human body is so well adapted to this endeavor.  My book club read it and it was all thumbs up.
B000002GJH|5.0|I will not try and explain the history of this band, but if you don't know look it up. It was a one album super group.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|As long as you're the type of person who can smile at an adorable animated rat that cooks, you'll love this too.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game, but when I placed an order it I did not receive any money or credits! I would give this game a higher rating if you actually got what you paid for when placing the order!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this album!!! I love his voice as well. This is one of his best works yet. Definitely worth buying. But a little disappointed there's only 10 songs...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is really fun and really cool. It has ropes to swing on and really big hills. It is a fun game
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I thought that this book was a great idea for a novel. The story unfolded in a very gripping way.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Deserving of the Best Picture Academy Award, Ben Affleck knocks it out of the park. Definitely see this movie. You won't regret it.
B003L20IHE|5.0|Came very quick and in good condition. I am excited to give this to my daughter for Easter. It was on her Wish List on Amazon
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The ability to get precise radar weather at any time and not have to wait until 11:20PM on the 11 oclock news is great.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|The game keeps you looking for different ways to complete it.  It keeps my grandchild busy for hours. I hope you enjyoy it too.
B007REV4YI|5.0|First I want to say that I have amazon prime and I as scheduled to receive the movie on Wednesday and got it on Tuesday so I was very pleased about that. I was never really a huge fan of the Bond movies prior o Daniel Craig's version of the British secret agent. So when I say &#34;Best Bond&#34;, I mean of his 3 movies. Skyfall definitely takes the cake on the series. The title fits the movie as Bond is forced to, in a sense, reincarnate himself as who he is. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. All I can say is this is a most definitely a must buy on blu-ray.
0142421375|2.0|It was ok, but not nearly as good as the first. It felt like there was no conclution, it just happened, and also was a slow book overall.
B00466HM28|5.0|i order this a while back and just now getting around to reviewing it. I order it and just got the free shipping but it came withing 3 days it works amazingly with ableton (any version) highly customizable the reviews about the pads being hard to press are true but it isn't a problem at all once you get used to it. I got a couple friends to buy it also and they love it i suggest this to anyone you wont regret it.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|We watched this on a whim (I'm a sucker for big waves) and really were very pleasantly surprised. Both entertaining and fascinating stuff.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Common sense in the 21st century. A must for anyone who cares about the economy. We all should in these days.
B008JAGG38|1.0|Unfortunately the original American Reunion should have been a one hit wonder.  Perhaps there are too many egos in the way and really Stiffler's Mom was the true talent here.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Cool concept, amazing graphics, but still kinda boring. The same thing happens every step of the way. You take a step or two.....do a hidden object puzzle, get a clue from said puzzle......Repeat. And so on and so on and so on. Every now and again you take the clue and do another puzzle with it but nothing too exciting. There is no real poi t and click aspect and I guess thats fine but from the storyline and build up....well it could be so much more. So 3 stars overall because I was disappointed at the games limitations but the Hidden Object Game, if I was rating only what I believed was a basic Hidden Object Game 4 stars probably even 5. Sorry if this is confusing but for those of you who get my disjointed way of logical thinking, &quot; am I right or what?&quot;.........What ??????? LOL
B002JODPSO|5.0|I loved how they brought the Die Hard franchise into the 21st century.  Bruce Willis is still vital and Timothy Olyphant is evil.  My favorite part is the evil chick's death.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|I love this album. Reminds me if their 80's work. Fast paced music.<br />Reminds me of Walls of Jericho and Pink Bubbles Go Ape
0143038095|5.0|Typically, I begin reading a book but get sidetracked with other tasks.  The format style is a collection of short stories that is easier to manage.  The stories are elaborate but short, just love it!!
