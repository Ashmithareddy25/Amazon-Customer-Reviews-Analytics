B004RCZB38|5|This is much more than just a wash bucket.  C'mon!  Think outside the box!  It is a watertight container for all sorts of fun stuff.  We carry it in our tiny camper and appreciate that if folds up to a surprisingly small size.
B000E7WLJW|5|The bag is made of durable plastic and it fit perfectly over out hitch carrier.  I liked that is flexible and the size allowed us to fit a lot of luggage.  We drove through rain,  dusty/windy areas and everything inside was protected.  Also,  the height of the bag was just right and did not block my vehicle's brake lights.  We purchased a bungee net to go over it, and keep it extra secure on the carrier.  The bag does come with straps though and they seemed to do the job just fine.
B000CMHVG2|5|Nice product. Quality item, great price
B004UQQT0A|5|good
B00UITOWGQ|4|Nice, solid looking components. Though only the bottom and top plates of the ballasts are metal, the  middle section is silver colored plastic.  The 5000K bulbs I rcvd were mismatched. Both had a bluish color, but one was greenish blue.  I was under  the impression that 5000k bulbs should be a bright white with no blue color.  Kudos to Opt7 customer service.  I was sent replacement bulbs promptly after I sent an email to them.  The replacement pair of bulbs seem to be a much better set in terms of color temperature.
B004ZF3YWM|4|Great headlights! th color is great and they are very bright! Only problem I have is when I start my truck only one comes on. Then I turn my bright lights on and off then they both come on. Not sure what I need to do there. But over all its a good buy. I would defiantly buy them again!
B00HAPNXDY|5|Perfect fitment
B00IRWFQUW|5|I like it. I'm picky
B00N58VRYC|5|I purchased this product to clean the carbs in my 1999 Yamaha Vmax motorcycle. I used about 4 ounces per fill up for 3 full ups and by the 3rd fill up you could definitely notice that it ran smoother.
B00650QBJI|5|Great
B00EYPIJYQ|5|Professional sticker, great adhesive, thick sticker, great product.
B0059HJKBY|3|Can be difficult to use as needle needs to be positioned on zerk exactly the right way or the grease won't go in and makes a mess.
B007X65U9U|5|nice
B009TC50LE|4|Works and fits great. You can tell it's not as strong as the OEM product, but for a replacement handle on a 170K mile truck, works just fine and easy to install.
B004AHAD2E|4|Mini Breaker - Not very rugged however should serve the purpose. Bussmann is normally a solid product.
B008G4Y076|1|They were to small.
B00DPYB980|5|Took a couple of weeks to arrive (which was expected). The company is smart; they use a hot-pink envelope, and clearly mark the envelope, so it doesn't get lost with the junk mail in your mail box.<br /><br />Application was easier than expected, and it's held up through a few car washes already. FYI, this goes on the outside of your car window. I was worried it wouldn't lie on my curved rear windshield well, but each letter is a separate piece, so a curved surface is not a problem.
B0002NIIPY|5|The product arrived sooner than I expected.  I put these on my power wheelchair & they look great!  I'd definitely order these again & I'd also highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to add flame decals to anything.
B0022UP8XA|5|Great cover! I have waited to review this until we had some seasons pass. This has held up extremely well, Doesn't leak at all and keeps the bike in great shape. It has had some terrible wind tugging at it, as well as rain storms. All is still fine. I could no have made a better choice.
B000BYB2K2|2|Mediocre at best, the old style non-beam blades actually worked better. These don't have enough flex so they don't follow the contours of the windshield tightly and the leave sections unwiped in the corners. They also have tremendous lift at speed, the drivers side blade basically doesn't wipe at all on the return stroke, all the water pushed in place by the passenger side wiper is left untouched by the drivers side wiper on it's return stroke as the wiper lifts off the screen.
B00DNPUX6K|5|Pretty awesome key chain.
B00SH33Y00|5|Works great. No issues
B00KJAMNII|5|The part was exactly what I needed. It works great!
B004DJ0AHM|5|Nice, authentic
B00KLKPYX2|5|Fit and worked great
B00C0CN7HY|5|Very good helmet.  Nice & plush cushion inside.  Nice visor & actual working air vents.  I ordered a size larger than i needed going by other reviews & glad i did.  Fits almost perfect.  Nice helmet for the price.  I liked it enough i ordered another for the wife
B00WZ9Z8R4|2|The brake lever is perfect however the clutch lever has a little bit of free play where it is mounted so it has about 1/8-1/4 of wiggle room. 2006 ZX10R
B00D3EYXVC|5|Love it Jason Richmond tx.
B00N16RH3S|4|I got this for those who seem to think they need to push the car in front, I have to bet they need to see more of these statements.
B0077M24EY|4|Needs more zip ties. Only came with two per screen. Needed seven per screen to fit tight. Good quality product
B00199BXU2|5|Great buy!  fixed GM code P0161. Easy to install. Lots of U tube videos on how to replace.
B000CMDAEE|1|Honda accord has different bolts. The 05 accord has standard bolts with flat head. These aren't them.
B00MIZTAK6|5|Super cute protection. Just don't leave your keys around if have little kids!
B000CMD9TK|4|like it
B00KGNT4VM|1|After my husband installed the hood emblem (which was very easy), the silver turned gold or yellow.  Yuck, on a silver car.  We have put the second in the sun to see if it does the same.  If it does, I will be returning them.
B001TI5IIQ|4|It does work BUT it does not do miracles. As long as you don't have high expectation, this product will satisfy you. It does what it says. I won't buy this again as you have to do it all by hand for A LONG TIME. I'd prefer the ones that you use a drill, much faster and easier.
B00B4ZRTV8|5|works great
B000C55WEM|5|Direct replacement on my 83 Toyota straight front axle.  Greasable is a plus.  Great product
B00R96SCVW|5|Fabulous thank you so very very much
B00MQ55STK|1|Weak light, not enough PAR to yield well.
B00AYIY9DM|4|Worked well upon installation. No issues so far but it's early days you know. Will get back with further feedback as necessary.
B005VWR4TW|5|It's OEM and looks exactly like the same part that I replaced on my 2006 Sequoia. I was hoping it would be thicker, but should last another 9 years.
B000F5DQWY|5|Great horn for both of our JK Wranglers!
B0036E9VB6|5|muy bueno ..... bery goood
B000EDUUG2|5|Handy little bugger.
B00E01OXQC|5|Ashtray ft perfectly
B008A7U13G|2|Ordered two of these one for my vehicle and one for my wifes. Upon application the decal would not stick to the window. Yes, I have applied a window decal before and yes I cleaned and treated the window prior to attempted application. I live in Phoenix, AZ so I'm not sure if temperature played a factor but my end result was 10 dollars and two decals in the garbage. Hope you have better results.
B000182DPG|5|always a good thing k&n
B0055AW0N0|5|it worked
B000OE23U2|4|fit good.
B00FKAM7J2|4|One was broken in the box. I would like a replacement.
B00U8YEIZQ|5|I seems to be working well. Arrived in good condition
B0009JKGJW|5|Great stuff. So many uses and a good price
B0025TZLK8|5|Great Product - Thank You!!
B00BVB6SUI|5|Worked perfect. However it was just the inside latch that broke so we just swapped  it out took like 5 min.
B00QK411AS|5|Excellent product and no more struggles at auto part stores
B006VOSH5O|4|Great product for the price its loud and has a good tone but you get what you pay for
B005TTZ714|5|Pros: Perfect for stock Jeep JK or up to 2 inch lift. So much easier than crawling underneath to unbolt your sway bars and more articulation than the Rubicons electronic disconnect.<br />Cons: You must be on level ground to reconnect. After a muddy day can be a bear trying to get the pins back in.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Seems to work fine, had not been able to check the accuracy
B00GJMXTD8|4|works
B0093N7Y4K|5|Very quiet, oem shoes (for Chrysler), The Magneti Marelli i believe is an Italian company that used to make formula 1 parts,  used them on my camry 2001 lol. Replaced my noisy Raybestos professional grade with these(they were noisy from day one) , no noise on day one (no break in needed) and this is my 2nd month still no noise,  very good braking power(increased braking power gradually) , however i also replaced my drums  which were warped (with beck and arnley), now braking is less pain, no need to press like im doing squads and no noise.
B00LM55Y0S|1|I ordered watermelon air fresheners and received Cinna-Berry even though the description and everything says watermelon. Not what I wanted. Very decieving and dissappointing!
B00NY0S2OY|5|Very Good
B00C5F9GTO|5|The best gasket hands down for an old 1.6 liter diesel rabbit.<br />My old pickup truck no longer needs depends for the valve cover oil leak.
B007KPUXVY|5|Fit nice and snug
B001BET3FM|5|work great on my 1500 2009 chevy
B000X3EUTQ|5|These are some fantastic brakes. I've been using the OEM Infiniti brakes and they are just horrible with the dust. Since I've switched over to Akebono's, I have no noises or dust. I'll be using these brakes from now on.
B003XWXW7K|5|Great top that doesn't leak and looks great. It's quiet for a convertible top and just as well constructed as the factory top. The dark tint hides my items in the back as well.
B00II8HCZC|5|Awesome
B0000AYB5K|3|It was OK, but the Alan Key screw (male) goes into a &#34;brass&#34; (female) retailer that stripped when I tightened the Alan Key screw. This should not be &#34;brass&#34;, they should have used something stronger, like stainless steel.
B00KTJ1PLU|4|Works great, easy setup, super cheap. Range is just a bit short.
B00PPTZA8I|3|Lasted 1 week
B002P33KVQ|5|Works Great
B003FPA6MY|5|I purchased this for a friend that has a 69 Camaro Z28. He loves it. It looks good on him
B0013RIOMK|5|WOW!!! These look UH-MAZING on the Jeep and really bring out the black and yellow scheme of the vehicle!! Easy pop-in installation only took minutes. Painted mine a gloss black to match the other gloss black contours of the jeep! Definitely recommend for anyone looking to bring that old grille back to life!!
B00BQS6UA4|4|Not sure what negative reviews are about. Product feels better quality than nasty, brittle original. Sure, it doesn't have the O ring. Is the ring worth an extra $40? Sheesh. Fit great. Works great (with old O ring). Perhaps it'll turn to dust after another 100,000 miles. Oh dear.
B004I0J8ZG|5|Works and fit perfectly
B00OZF0CMM|1|Junk...
B00RH3AMIS|5|Just right for using our extensions with. Keeps all metal equipment away from chrome and bike.  These were so good, I ordered another set......
B00KG14LBM|4|Quality is good, fit is very tight, I am very pleased
B00I82C38O|5|great looking product
B004VE3BBG|5|Looks great. Little tricky to apply so be careful. Been through a half dozen automatic car washes, no problem.
B003S5TBP4|5|Perfect
B0019I5KT8|5|just what we need.
B0060HVEOS|1|um...I bought this to clean my S labeled sofa..no stains..just an arm rest and cushion that were soiled from use...I can honestly say this did nothing....in fact...I question whether this has any thing in it at all..it seems to be just fragrant water..there is a warning label on the bottle that says to use in a well ventilated area..there were no fumes at all...just a light citrus scent..no cleaning action...and after the area dried it still had the same smell I was hoping to get rid of...?...maybe I received a &#34;bad&#34; bottle...ugh...will try to return
B00BITREA6|5|Excellent
B00I565MOA|4|Great helmet for the price.
B00X943I8U|5|Very pleased. Was more than what I expected. It came in really quick and so far it has stayed on my wall. I will be definitely be ordering more to add to the collection
B001LHVOVK|2|Stopped working after less than 10 uses.
B005PZMKZI|3|It does not fit in a murano
B009YYVSZO|5|Tried the fram brand, but these work fine and good quality.  Also save by buying 1/2/ case.
B0009V1WSE|5|Quality good, works as described, solid construction .
B002GOX3O8|4|It was very difficult to take off of the paper and it tore in the process, but I was able to get it onto my car without too much notice that it had a tear. I love the mirrored effect!
B00WJLZO8G|5|The mirrors are great. SMT MOTO went the. Extra mile to make sure I got just what I ordered.<br />Thanks Alex
B00FX49LMQ|3|It works overall, but it didn't remove every trace of rail dust. The smell is awful and you have to give your car a very thorough wash to make sure the product gets off.
B007ZGE7MO|5|Fits really well and helps with dirt, rock, sand, snow, and salt very well!
B000CB2U9G|1|this does not fit a 2000 vw golf gl 2.0. Amazon says it does; it does not. Thread pitch and diameter is wrong.
B000IYIWDU|5|It was a major job taking the dashboard off to replace the part but worth every penny I saved doing it myself.
B000AA4RVI|4|Buy it at any truck stop 10 dollars less
B003INQ8QQ|4|I was looking for a gift to provide to some employees. I really liked this idea since you can keep your coffee warm on the way to work. They were extremely happy with this mug and use them every day.
B00C5T2W3W|5|works great,exact replacement, as advertised
B00QQZHCUO|5|Excellent sticker... looks even  better than on line<br />fast service. .. thank you
B00HW6JBDM|5|Excellent and received it fast. .. looks great. .. very happy with the decol....
B000VKTUFU|1|I ordered this for my 2008 BMW X5 3.0.  But it's does NOT fit the cabin air cleaner.  In fact I bought two as the housing has two filters.  This replacement air filter is twice as big as both originals added together.  So I returned it.  No problem.  But I tried again with an explanation of the problem.  And you know they just shipped out the same thing again.  So I am returning it and looking for another source.  FRUSTRATED.!
B003E1O9ZE|2|A thin wall hose with cheaply made fittings. Mine leaked the first time it was used. The ferrule was not properly crimped on the male end barb. I repaired it with a plastic fitting rather than bother returning it. OK for temporary use but I would not go away and leave it under pressure.
B00AWE0H8Y|5|Works great on my YZF-R3. Easy to lift onto the stands by myself. So far they've held up and it's so easy to work on the chain. I do recommend if you are an R3 owner.
B003XGYDE2|5|Good product!!
B00CRQSYY4|5|Great for tapping into circuits without a lot of fuss. Made my life easier!
B0016KG72I|1|Wrong
B00N2BX600|3|Does Not support e bikes with lithium ion batteries. Bikes weigh about 60 pounds each which would be in the weight limits this is advertised for  but the weight is lopsided so that causes problems. Even when I tried to load them opposite ways.  I did get a quick and easy refund though.
B007T4JTHU|4|as advertised, the plastic feels a little cheaper than on my original set.
B001LHVOVK|5|Excellent Product, just as advertise
B000BZZR8O|5|The best rotors for your Infiniti G35 that you can get for the price! They are smooth and quiet. I would recommend using these rotors along with the Akebono brakes.
B002MQDY4O|4|The product was easy to install. It took me all of two minutes. It doesn't 100% perfect but certainly gets the job done on the cheap. It also has a textured look instead of smooth. No big deal
B004QEKGA0|5|Easy to assemble...30 minutes tops, just don't fully tighten until it's all together. I hauled about 200 pounds of luggage just under 1000 miles without a problem.
B00EN7G72G|5|I got it and it works.
B00II5YD4S|5|Like a chamois without all the ringing out! Nice!
B00EZZVI7U|5|So far so good!
B00ABKSL3C|5|I carry both shields with me to swap for when it gets dark/light. This is the perfect way to protect the spare one in my top case not being used. It's soft/smooth to protect from scratches, and just the right thickness for padding but without taking up a ton of room. Very happy with this purchase. Face shields are expensive you know!
B00HQZAYCQ|5|Looks great on my Camaro.☺️💁🏾
B000CGTKJO|5|Ordered these for a 2000 Monte Carlo for the decrease in dust on my new rims. There was more dust than I had hoped but it was a big improvement from stock.
B0094E5IWI|4|Works out for what I need have to put extra tape on though
B000BRCGNQ|3|Moves much more air than the cheapie that came in the trailer plus it is reversible. Bad news is that it's noisy, disappointingly so.
B00651CLCS|3|Not what I thought. It does pick up signal but not as well as the original antenna. If you don't mind that... it's an ok addition to your to your rig. It's a low profile antenna and looks great
B00768MLGK|4|this product is awesome! i have tried this on my different kinds of glass and each time it worked perfectly! i would definitely recommend this product.
B00DE95XXS|4|Product was as expected.
B000C57K9M|5|Installed myself on a 2000 Monte Carlo. Worked great and easy install if you know what you are doing. Remember to get an alignment when you are done.
B00Y195OR0|3|Very hard to get rid of the odor.
B0083G3AXC|3|New iPhone 6 in case doesn't fit in slots.
B000VVW984|5|It works great!  Was easy to install.  Happy ever after.
B00WID0OEE|5|I didn't get on time (two days), it took three, but that is an issue with my local UPS (Belton, TX). Anyway, after testing this on my shower, I Immediately tossed my other recently bought squegee which seems to use low-grade rubber. I really knew this one was &#34;the one&#34; because my wife will squegee the shower herself after using rather than wait for me to do it...was to much work with the other squeegee. Overall, a great product. The extra silicone inserts are a bonus.
B000XSGKYO|3|good quality, but should have ordered the one with straight handle
B00PV6VWV4|5|Great product.
B0023080RU|5|good deal
B002M4G24U|5|Saved me a ton of money and time. Thought my leak was a rear main seal, but after using the dye, it was traced to a cracked oil filter!
B00DCO1J38|5|Great buy. works well. I have it installed and have no problems at all. Fits my 2000 Saturn Wagon
B0028JQYPG|5|Good.
B00RG9C79U|5|Will work perfect for storm cellar lighting application.
B002YKBPXA|5|I got this for my boyfriend as a gift along with some beef jerky. As predicted he acted like a caveman and was more excited about the stick and meat than he was about the fancy watch I got him. So ladies, it only costs about $20 to make your boyfriend the happiest man alive.
B004FG1H84|2|The quality of the merchandise is poor and the aspect ordinary
B0044A537C|5|My 2004 Mazda 6 2.3 L had a CEL that pointed to the sensors, They look and feel same or better than the OEM part, no problems at all since installed
B003VCILQY|5|this is my second one and i love it! the flowers are very bright and colorful.  the only thing i dont care for is the rubbery smell of the material. other than that it is perfect!
B00NJRYY26|5|It was perfect. Loveit
B008QS9NEW|5|A+++
B0019C2V9G|1|No Light output! Halo lights never appear to be &#34;on&#34; but they are...
B00UPIYL2A|5|The sticker is awesome! I have no worries with it I love how it causes attention it's amazing!
B0015RN4DM|1|These were the wrong size springs
B000HKVDKE|5|10 Minute install. Fits as advertised
B0002D6K86|4|Great little pan for the money!  Make sure to use the non stick cooking spray or it will stick.
B0041MEB8A|3|The units fit well but failed after 18 months of occasional use.
B005VPS358|5|Perfect Fit, easy install. Took about 1 hour per side (including replacing shocks at the same time). Didn't even use anything but hand tools, I remembered to soak all the bolts a couple times while waiting for them to be delivered. Raised jeep up about 1.5 inches, which actually isn't a lift, its restoring it back to its original ride height.<br /><br />Fit well with my 2&#34; shackle lift.
B00U6D5HZE|5|Easily installed and shipped fast. Perfect purchase thanks.
B00FEEABG0|5|Items look great,referred friends
B0057UIIWA|5|Perfect exactly what I wanted
B0007XVWW0|5|For some reason the atwood brand has lasted a lot longer than the knock-off brand my dealership gave me for my water heater. The generic brand started leaking out through the middle in just a few weeks of camping. I replaced it with one of these and haven't had any issues since (a few months now) and I haven't had to touch the second one this pack came in. As I get older I realize that sometimes cheap is more expensive, just buy the plug that was made for it and save yourself the headache.
B004BTT2SM|5|Excellent
B0039LEZFS|2|we need 6mm and this tool has 8mm spanner pins, not works for me to lock the variator of my gy6 scooter. But it works to hold the clutch.
B002R4P8Z4|3|These are comfortable and fit well but they do not wear well over time. They are thicker than some other Nomex socks I have like Puma but the threads tend to snag and wear holes in them far faster. They don't seem as durable as some of the other brands and already have holes appearing after less than one seas and about 6 race weekends. Recommend some of the higher end soaks sure there more expensive but they tend to last.
B007URTP8Y|5|Perfect fit! Me and my son installed it ourselves. :)
B00L7XE6M2|5|They fit good and look good!
B001GF0MGA|4|Does a nice job of filling in the window and keeping the heat out. Especially in this AZ desert sun. Only downside is it folds down kinda large. Takes up a bit of space. Worth it though.
B000E7WLJW|5|Great bag! We took it on a week long trip and had to pack and unpack it several times. We had three rain storms hit while driving and everything stayed perfectly dry. It's very durable and easy to strap down. The expandable top section was a plus as we ended up bringing more home than we left with after some shopping trips... you can't go wrong with this bag! Happy Trails.
B00QF0S6LO|5|As advertised!
B0009JB7GI|5|Excellent product works as stated
B004WO15F4|5|looks great. alignment afterwards was a pain. rides well.
B00GSG4MRC|5|Nice product
B00U5IDWOI|2|Doesnt stick that good after 1 week
B00KH9OMDA|2|I was not pleased with it.  It did not fit my escalade front window.
B007AOQORC|5|These can take abuse! They fit well and look amazing.
B0099SL2L0|5|Excellent... Simple to use... Saves, time, money, and headaches!
B00GRSOJSS|5|This worked extremely well in removing the rust from some old hardware I had, including some spade connectors that were so corroded that they couldn't be removed even with pliers.
B005ZZH7G0|5|Great quality product! Easy installation. Seems better than factory part.
B0068C39CA|5|Everything is perfect
B000RG9SRI|1|Garbage- bad cable.
B00RB1QRDU|5|Fuel Pump and Filter System Worked Excellent,  The Vendor was Very Professional to Work with.  I will purchase more product from them in the future  Thank you.
B008FZD2F2|5|Fits well, fast shipping!
B000C847OU|1|Gasket disintegrated the first time I started the car. I had to remove small pieces from the cooling system and clean up the coolant that SPRAYED from the connection. I was under the impression that this was a premium gasket. I ended up using the gasket supplied with the new thermostat and it worked fine.
B00JA392Q6|5|I purchases the 24&#34; and 19&#34; PIAA Aero Vogue Silicon wipers for my mom's 2005 Camry. It has been using Bosch Icon wipers for the past 3 years and have worked well, but a recent storm cracked the windshield and had to be replaced. When that was done, I installed the new PIAA wipers. They do an amazing job since they are made from silicon. It cleans the water off, does not streak or chatter, and there is no noise. It was a toss up between the Aero Vogue and the Si-Tech, but the Aero Vogue is still made in Japan while the Si-Tech is now being made in Vietnam (lower quality).<br /><br />On a side note, I did try PIAA wipers on my 2009 Altima. The Aero Vogue 26 or 28&#34; on the drivers side and 17&#34; on the passenger side, but due to the curvature of the glass, several inches of the blade do not even touch the glass. I then tried the Si-Tech 26&#34; and 17&#34; on the Altima, and they do it and make full contact with the glass. But when used at high wiper speed, part of the wiper place arm is turning under and makes a loud squeaking noise. So I ended up buying a new pair of Bosch Icons for the Altima.
B000GKEXW0|5|great
B00L1RUUZQ|2|nice lugs, bad application info, also, if you need to return beacuase of that bad info, unlike many amazon products, you need to return to DP at your own exprndr... do not buy....  wow
B000IY8OLU|1|Not for my car , these do not work on a 07 Kia Rio as the car has coil overs.
B000CPI5Y6|5|Perfect for my Alfa. Just like the oem.
B000E28EL6|5|well built, easy to install.
B00KTHWNL8|5|Arrived on time. Got them cut and programmed for $100. Self-programming did not seem to be a viable option.
B00MMPEWX2|5|Quality parts and direct fit except the gasket for the throttle didn't come with it.
B00LEDRNKC|5|it was what I wanted and fit perfectly
B000JFJLTC|5|great tool
B000BZG8YQ|5|Good fit.
B009PJJHT2|5|No more broken dipstick. looks so much better.
B00PCRWNBK|5|great quality for the price!
B00MP08TOC|3|It's a very well made light. Bright enough to use as back up lights. The mount is a bit tricky to assemble and I had to add flat washers because the screws are a bit too long. But once completed, it is a very strong mount . I knocked off 2 stars for the blue color of the emitted light. I think when the manufacture starts making these lights with the 4500K color temp., they will see a increase in sales. The blue color of the emitted light just isn't right... Would I buy it again? No, not until they are offered in the 4500k color...
B00D9C2CDO|5|This stayed in tact the whole 14 hour trip. It was much easier than our plastic cargo topper that was well over $150. Im so glad we got this!
B000CMHTU0|3|OK. Didn't fit well.
B0088X5DMQ|5|Perfect for my TL 10!!! It works great...
B000F72RKY|1|Broke the first time I used it.
B00WFHZJNY|1|Useless, changed nothing
B000E8SXQQ|2|Was fast shipping and went in perfectly but there already making noises and not doing there job after 5 months and only after 2 oil changes
B00IO97QQ0|5|Brakes and rotors came in looking even better in person and work like a charm!! Work great on my '01 Wrangler Sport!!!
B00TW5MQ74|5|great fits well.
B00NNFT09G|3|these will do the job. the only complaint i have is that when you look close you can see that the honda logo was poorly painted on. but from a distance and when driving no one would be able to spot the flaws. i put these on my RSX type S and they fit perfectly.
B00IX18JM4|3|Ok but the bolts are too short. Had to buy longer 6 mm bolts and cut a slot to use a screwdriver because my hardware store didn't have proper replacements.
B000C2SJNQ|1|One ridge of belt unraveled within first 50 miles. Had to replace with cheaper auto parts store belt that so far is good after 1000 miles. Can not determine belt had a flaw or if product is not good.
B005DZJA30|5|Great buy
B000OQJG0K|5|Have used these for years!! Perfect tool that every tool box should have. Run a black magic marker over the increments and wipe the<br />excess off, makes it a lot easier to read.
B00KF9180W|5|Great quality, and quality is my personal rubric. These balaclavas are light weight and well stitched. They are versatile in that you can wear them in many different configurations. Plus, you get two and they are different colors for different situations. On top of all that the shipping was quick and otherwise reasonable.
B0002ILK4K|5|Shipped quickly.  I needed three but order two.  I purchased a different brand battery locally and paid over 2 1/2 times the price of these.  I recommend these batteries as they work well, fit perfectly and are a good value.
B00H7R2R28|3|You have to wait a long time for epacket delivery from China. Once it came in I figured out it was about half as thick as the OEM ring. It bends a lot easier than I think it should. And I had to trim one of the little tabs down since they weren't even length and it didn't fit quite right on my 2012 fob. I only wanted it for the color mainly. So in that regard it's doing it's job. But the OEM one is MUCH higher quality. I expect this one to fail at some point. Sometimes just having it in my pocket a little string or other keys or something will snag on it. But for the price I'll enjoy it while it lasts.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Was kinda concerned after reading some of the reviews but thought I would give it a try. It was delivered on time (maybe a day early), was real easy to install and works perfect! Just follow the directions and don't rush through it.
B007IUPF7I|5|Very bright and easy to apply.
B00C59A6QM|5|Good product to isolate the battery on my CRV.  The battery on the car was going dead after towing for a number of hours. With this switch installed, I have not had the problem again.
B005I7JAX8|3|The one I got wouldn't connect to engine computers and was missing computer hook...but amazon refunded no problem
B010OYOHO6|5|This is a really great unit!  I have been using it to listen to audio books while working in my shop.  No cords to get in the way while I am working. The sound is great and it drowns out the noise from my machinery. Can't find any fault with it for what I am using it for.  The built in radio is also cool. Highly recommended!
B00AYJK5CA|3|It was working fine for about a month, then it stopped working.
B0000AX5WS|5|Great helmet especially for the money
B004IYQV34|5|Excellent
B001GRW1YE|5|Very good
B002OMQN1W|5|Fits a VStrom 650 seat when not stretched out. The unstretched opening is 20&#34; but it will stretch out to 35&#34; as labled for Harley seats. I'm using it to cover my 28&#34; x 15&#34; Saddleman gel track seat for my 2014 DL-650 VStrom. It works fine. I slightly rock the seat front  to get the elastic lip between the seat front & gas tank & then let it stretch out over the seat back & sides. It has been staying in place OK so far. I could put gloves under it to keep from getting a pond on it in the rain. I haven't tried to put my half helmet under it yet.
B00B43GHK4|5|Excellent product and still looks as good today as it did the day that I bought it. My truck has been through the wash more than 20 times since I put this on, still looks great.
B0001EFSTI|3|I find it neat to keep on a keychain but hard to open to access the blade and bottle opener.
B00ABYVTXM|1|The blower works great for blowing off wheels and all the cracks and crevices that hold water, I don't think it's intended to blow off an entire car. I gave it one star because while using it, it just stopped working, and now I have no clue how to return it for a new one, I really miss using it, and hopefully it was just a freak thing that broke
B000W3RU9Y|1|I bought these to replace a pair of bungees that had been holding a fence gate shut for six months -- in full sun exposure. Those bungees felt a bit tired, so I replaced them with these &#34;industrial&#34; cords. I was shocked to find that the Erikson product felt MORE WORN OUT than the cords already on the gate. I bought those old cords at Costco 10 years ago, used them 50 times for various things, and most recently have had them cooking through a dought-year summer on an outdoor gate.<br /><br />I was so disappointed in the Erikson cords that I spent 20 minutes returning them to Amazon. My total refund minus postage costs is about $5. I would have saved money by simply throwing these in the trash, but I wanted them off my property even if I had to pay to do it. That's how lousy these bungees are.<br /><br />If you need good bungee cords, don't buy these; you'll regret it.
B00G85J02K|5|Great product, matches my silver audi q5 perfectly. I feel that the antitheft feature is unnecessary though.
B00803BDGE|5|Cheap but nice look!!! Brought two
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Very bright light for it size
B009SX2L16|5|Good
B000I45Y8Q|5|Good product.  The sockets work well on the gm seat tracks.
B000H6QWWC|1|Very elaborate packaging that was impossible removed without attacking it with a hacksaw!<br />There's no reason to make this thing so difficult to remove took me five minutes and a couple handtools to get the damn thing out of the package.<br />Quality seems so so
B00Y1HS6GS|5|They arrived promptly and work fine!
B002C6ICS2|5|It is what it is
B009S31X6U|3|wrong fit!
B00XJFK3IM|3|Ballast worked great, but bulbs didn't work at all.
B00Y43U27A|4|Fits the Nikon D7000 perfectly.
B00KC8OLYQ|5|Fixed our melted one!
B007VXD100|1|Absolutely in aw due to it says 1 yr warranty and I including wife received run around before a yr, and they never warranted item! I am a licensed electrician and the board including 3 resistor's are bad now, brake led won't work now at all!!!
B0055PD1H4|4|It was actually pretty good and used it on the inside of the car...parts that were plastic
B00Q10NE7Y|5|Fit and worked perfectly on our 2007 Saturn Outlook
B000UVENUM|5|Pretty awesome. My son loves it.
B002J7VX4Y|5|This holds lots of sprays, more like for commercial use.. won't run out in my lifetime - Lol!
B000C57X62|5|Good Quality Moog parts.
B004W5SFYW|5|fits my west marine group 24 perfectly
B00UFERZKO|3|Bought this to run a small electric chainsaw out or my wrangler but its just not strong enough. But my buddy uses it to charge ryobi batteries and run a small tv.
B00LLOFQ30|5|Fantastic on my 99 honda prelude had my campus police officer rolling laughing
B007CLNIJK|5|Excellent fit for my 03' Ford Focus. Well priced compared to 'Stealership' prices. Easy to install. Note: Be sure you save to two screws that held the old mirror in place, as the new one does not have them as part of the package.
B000C5I6FE|4|After about 3 months the pluge I uses in my car with it stopped working and this is the only thing I ever used in it... But not sure if this was the cause so as a lighter it is fantastic and get hit very quickly, in my car it would pop after about 5 seconds if not less.
B00DGZI116|5|I use it for a fish finder and it works great.
B001DUIZ9E|5|I am currently running it on my truck and it fits great.
B008XNZZ7O|5|Love,Love,Love!!!
B008VJES28|3|Wrong item ordered
B0016I8E1M|5|After a lot of research I decided to go with the ROLA 59502 2&#34; Steel Cargo Carrier - 2 Piece hitch hauler.  I had borrowed another manufacturer's one from a neighborhood and was very disappointed that it wobbled and was very poor quality.  I wanted something heavy duty that would hold up for a long time.  The ROLA  unit here is very strong and does not lean or wobble.  It is constructed of heavy gauge steel and built for the long haul.<br />I decided to add LED stop/turn/tail lights purchased on Amazon: (2 Autosmart Kl-35100rk Red Oval Sealed LED Turn Signal and Parking Light Kit with Light, Grommet and Plug for Truck,Trailer (Turn, Stop, and Tail Light)<br />I paired them with the (Hopkins 48135 48&#34; 4 Wire Flat Trailer Side Connector) to make my own kit saving me a few bucks over the prewired kit offered on Amazon.  I wanted to make sure all the connection would be secure so I soldered all my connections and heat shrink'd all the wires to make sure I had a strong weather proof connection.  I used a piece of 1/2 inch PVC pipe to get the wires from the back to the front on the bottom side of the hitch hauler, placing rubber grommets on the end where the wires come through to insure they do not wear over time.<br />I decided to go with the  (ROLA 59119 Rainproof Cargo Carrier Bag 59&#34; x 24&#34; x 24&#34; (20 Cu Ft) to place my luggage in.  This bag is huge and top quality.  The dimensions are accurate and fit the ROLA 59502 perfectly.<br />I am very happy with the way my project turned out.  It was more expensive than other options but I think I have a much higher quality setup than any of the competitors on the market are offering.  Set-up and build was easy with the included instructions.  The only thing I did was buy some additional heavy duty washers for the curved bar connections in the middle (Chrome bar)  They give you 4 but I wanted a washer on both sides as the slot was only slightly smaller than the head of the bolt.<br />Shipping was perfect box was intact.  I think there were a few holes in the box but this is a very heavy item so I can understand.  The ROLA sticker that is on the rear was coming loose after the first trip so I decided to remove it and replace it with a DOT high reflective Red/White sticker.<br />[[ASIN:B00MGTS1WW ROLA 59119 Rainproof Cargo Carrier Bag 59&#34; x 24&#34; x 24&#34; (20 Cu Ft)]][[ASIN:B0049MIX68 Hopkins 48135 48&#34; 4 Wire Flat Trailer Side Connector]][[ASIN:B00IKSRTBM 2 Autosmart Kl-35100rk Red Oval Sealed LED Turn Signal and Parking Light Kit with Light, Grommet and Plug for Truck,Trailer (Turn, Stop, and Tail Light)]][[ASIN:B0016I8E1M ROLA 59502 2&#34; Steel Cargo Carrier - 2 Piece]]was intact.

B00B53FE0W|3|Its probably one of the best sounding exhaust systems ive heard. However, one tip sticks out farther than the other and both are off center. Its not too loud that its annoying has a nice throaty sound and the finish is great. Im gonna have my local muffler shop straighten the tips. It didnt quit bolt up correctly, i had to add some washers. Although it had fitment issues and crooked tips, it sounds great and is VERY cheap compared to others. After buying and installing and having the tips straightened ill only have a fraction of the price of other brands...
B001NAQSNO|1|Ordered this expensive filter for my bike and I get no gasket with it so now I have to buy another filter because no one has the gasket sepratly I'm not a happy customer because of I wanted two filters I would have got a cheap filter. I got this one because it's washable and now I'm stuck with a filter that is very useless.
B008G28J48|5|Makes my wife's 99 honda accord look like new again. Installed all new extra bright bulbs. Lights are brighter than my 2013 Kia sorento. Perfect fit. Would definitely buy again from this seller. Very fast delivery also. Remember bulbs are not included.
B0018PSASU|5|It seems that can lubricate every mechanic gear.
B0032YVDEI|5|Change my driving at night Nice and bright Recommended
B004I0YFR2|1|It don't fit my truck
B00S4HFNXK|4|These claim to be boat protectors but I'd say they're really far more useful for small craft like jet skis. They are very lightweight and okay for buffering a light-body aluminum boat. We used them on our 16 foot Smoker Craft, which has a double aluminum hull and they were fine, but I wouldn't use them as long-term bumpers, mainly because they are just so light they're likely to get tossed around too easily. I think these would be better for lake use as opposed to ocean use. If you are mooring a boat for any length of time I'd use something heavier and more durable.
B004BCFVAM|3|All plastic had to return one other than that it was great
B000H0KMEC|3|works
B00WFIJ362|5|Assembled, installed, tied bike down. Fit well, transported perfectly on my motor home. Had to add lock nuts and washers to the anti-rock bracket bolts. Highly recommend.
B004YJW95M|5|it works great. goes on easy.

B00PQWN5DQ|5|You know that saying, \\"A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.\\"  I now know that feeling, but with pressure gauges.  :D  Luckily, this measures pretty close to my other gauge, but they aren't the same.  At 30 psi, they agree.  When my long-time gauge says 35psi, this one says 34.  Close enough for me, but now I'm wondering which one is correct.  Btw, that discrepancy is consistent over four tires and multiple readings, so both gauges are self-consistent - they just don't agree with each other.  I'm actually okay with either 34 or 35 psi, so it doesn't really impact me beyond that nagging feeling that now I should get a third gauge.  :)  However, if you need accuracy, I unfortunately don't have enough data to tell you if this one is spot on.<br /><br />This gauge is easy to grip and use, and I like the little button on the side that resets the gauge back to zero.  The black ridges are a rubber sleeve that fits over the main gauge, and those are compliant and easy to grab.  I don't have any problems reading the gauge, but I (luckily) haven't had to use it at night on a dark road.  Reading it in my garage is no problem at all.  Some folks have remarked about the small print, which should be considered, but it's pretty easy for me to read.  I like that the marks are every 2 psi, so it's pretty easy to read to 1 psi because you can tell when the dial is half way between the marks.<br /><br />The very top of the input shaft rotates to let you more easily get this lined up with your valve stem, which is a big plus.  One note - just below that rotating part is a threaded joint that I initially thought also rotated until I realized that the top part is screwed on.  So, you want to make sure to keep that part screwed down tight and only rotate the very end where the pressure tap is located.<br /><br />All in all, I think it's a well made gauge, and I prefer analog gauges that don't rely on batteries.  I don't want to need my gauge only to discover that the battery is dead.  At the current $17 price, I won't say that I think it's a huge bargain, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't feel ripped off paying that much to get this.  I like the design and the overall construction.<br /><br />(I received a free sample for an evaluation and honest review.)to discover that the battery is dead.

B000GKD5NI|1|Terrible suction caps. I tried everything to make them work but nothing worked. I cannot find out a way to make it work. I do not recommend this product since it doesn't work! My window was clean and everything was ok just to install the cover but it didn't stay in place.
B00PB3NTZ4|5|Good stuff.  Way better than the original.
B0002KR88A|5|works good
B003BZD08U|5|works as it should
B007D1UPTU|5|Great helmet, good visibility, good ventilation, comfortable. First day I wore it was trip to Sturgis 700 miles first day. Love it!
B00RV83UUG|5|I installed this light and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.
B0030C54ZG|5|Wonderful experience. These bed rails came in less then 24 hours after ordering them with free shipping. They look and fit perfectly, no issues, great product.
B00UEABUKA|5|Read reviews claiming it ran small so I ordered up. Fits great. I did not find it flimsy at all. It's a great helmet for the price. Lots of versatility. Very very happy with this helmet.
B001MU5JOE|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B003V57NUQ|3|This product does not fit on the standard roof rails on my Chevy trailblazer. However, it does fit on my wife's Mecury Mariner (like Ford Escape). I am able to load my kayak on the rack fairly easy.  Haven't tried it on the interstate yet, but will soon.
B00BMDZHH0|5|On time and good product.
B003I806PU|2|They provide great lift but make your truck ride like complete crap I should have left it alone.  If you want a lift but don't care that your truck will ride like it has no suspension these springs are great. This was with bilstein 5100s on a 2005 tacoma dbl cab 4x4 trd off road
B000BR080E|4|Worked very well, cost nearly as much as the lock I used it on.
B01078GH6A|5|Nice looking, the perfect addition for my new car. My last car was a rolling dumpster, and I'm determined to keep this one nice, so having this is a must. When I'm alone, it hangs on the front of my passenger seat, but when I have my kids I simply twist it around so it hangs on the back of the seat.<br /><br />Best customer service ever, btw. This company sent me a really helpful email before it even arrived, making it clear that they stand behind their products. On the other hand, the $400 coffee table I ordered three months ago came with terrible service. I'll be ordering more accessories from this company just because of their service!
B002DZJQ0A|4|Quality is good but I think it's not value for money.
B001J7K2VK|2|Didn't do what I expected. I thought it would be sticky. Doesn't work for my phone.
B001O7CZB0|4|this was a decent purchase for the low price.... rattled a lot and the mount was too flimsy....a little cushion tape and mounting mods made it worth the low price... overall a good buy!
B0085IJZBO|5|Fits well, I have not tested for leaks yet.
B00AWPIEYC|4|just as shown have not climbed on it yet but seems to be strong
B0079M7JT2|5|Love it looks bad a**
B00BFIINLE|5|Great price, thank you!
B00480FHG0|5|No problems with this bulb. It directly replaces the OEM bulb in my 2002 Toyota Corolla.  This was my first time replacing a fog light bulb, and it was absolutely not intuitive.  But after watching a few youtube videos, it became a rather simple project.
B00HRSQ7O6|5|Great product! This saved me about $160 from the dealer. I would highly recommend this product!!!!!!
B00JRV1V2E|5|We used this thing a little harder than it was designed to be. But it held up just fine. We just had to do injectors in an LB7 and had a 3/8 drive pull handle and about 2 foot of pipe for a cheater. After my #1 tech tapped out and gave up on a stuck injector I braced up and pulled my heart out. Much to my surprise the injector popped out. With the injector cup attached! We were certain the puller wouldn't survive this truck after it pulled 3 injectors with the cups but it looks like new.
B008HT78BU|5|Very solid build . Exactly what I expected. Great for any mopar lover who wants a heavy Keychain
B00PUI2BAE|5|Works perfectly
B008XKLAFI|5|met all of my needs.
B004GEJLJM|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 mini cooper s
B010TZ8XCC|5|These fit great & look really good in my Chrysler 300
B000E3EXH4|5|fit good
B00P057UIA|1|Who new, comes from China??  Pieces thrown in an envelope. No directions??
B0013T5V6K|3|Serves its purpose.
B0103JB1Z0|5|Great product
B005VX9O4E|5|Delivered on time and exacta what I needed. What more could I ask?
B005XEFADU|5|Works very well. But of course I haven't used any others. The folks on my Yahoo group all swear by it. It is a bit pricey, but once you smell the alternative it's worth it..!
B002QHFHNU|2|Beware...these are nice turnbuckkes, but WAY ovetpriced.  The listing doesn't say how many are included.  Since 4 are required for a camper, at the price of $240. It's easy to assume that the set includes all four.  Well, it doesn't.  It only includes 2!  So, a complete set of four is going to set you back $500.  That's absurd!!!!<br />Lippert turnbuckles, by comparison, which are similar to Torklift, are $275 for a set of 4...and they tell you the set included 4.  Honesty in advertising
B0002SQUTU|4|Worth the money, this tool works very well on small cars and mini van brake calipers
B00NH6Z162|1|the spoiler warps in heat causing it to lift up to a 1/4 inch off the deck lid.  It was installed according to the instructions provided by an auto body shop twice and is still doing the same thing  Upon further searching this is not uncommon from this companys poduct.
B002UD0GFE|5|perfect of cleaning laptop screens - my place of employment has over 1200 laptops - this will be perfect
B001CO182C|5|I went in circles trying to figure out why my '01 Mercedes C320 was sputtering while idle with the 'check engine' light on. I scanned my car for codes and got about 5, a couple having to do with fuel trim malfunction, a couple having to do with cylinder misfire, and one having to do with mass air flow circuit malfunction.<br /><br />Took the car to the shop and had gotten a quote for $700 to replace spark plugs and spark plug wires which 'might' fix the issue. I had also consulted with a couple other people who recommended the mass air flow sensor be replaced. So, I essentially bought this mass air flow sensor at one-third the price (from Amazon) as offered by Mercedes-Benz as well as the various shops who I consulted.<br /><br />I replaced the mass air flow sensor, cleared the codes, and passed emissions!
B00MWNZ1B6|1|I bought Bosch thinking that the German engineering would be a good match for a Mercedes GLK350.  I was wrong. The minuscule installation diagram that comes with this blade is impossible to decipher even with a magnifying glass.  You won't get any help by going to boschautoparts dot com either.  The blades have options for a wide variety of arms:  j-hooks, small and large pin, bayonet, p&h, etc.  My wife's car is the p&h variety.  Simply slide the blade onto the pin and rotate the blade so that it is captive by a small L hook on the arm.  Problem with this Bosch blade is the attachment body is too narrow so the blade is free to move partially off the pin.  Not good.<br /><br />My solution was to get Rainx Lattitude blades from a local auto parts store.  The Rainx has universal fitting ability also, has legible install instructions, has a website with video help, and, best of all, it fits securely.
B000C3XD90|5|always the best if you're going to run 15k miles between oil changes
B00BSEJYCM|5|Great thanks
B00J11NH18|2|This thing came with air bubbles locked in between the layers and it gets creases in it so easily so it's difficult to &#34;roll&#34; onto the windshield. I would probably recommend these style shades instead: http://www.amazon.com/Basix-Magic-Shade-Jumbo-Styles/dp/B000BQR100/ref=sr_1_2?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1440345770&sr=1-2&keywords=sun+shades+for+windshield&pebp=1440345777692&perid=0QJ0P77SCPPCAG4DA3A5
B005XOVOUI|2|No instructions included. I have never put one on before. It doesn't look hard but even a simple diagram to follow would have been nice. I searched the Internet but couldn't find any instructions. Don't want to pay $90 per hour labor rate at a shop for something that looks like I can install myself. Product not tinted as dark as the picture. It's brown not black....And the brown is not a dark brown....it's a light brown :-(
B000CMHVJO|4|Easy and works best to not only slow down rate of fall but makes it very light to lift.

B00SCJKKZG|3|Installed on European 2014 Ford Focus. No installation instructions, no video's online. Good thing I know automobile electrics, and understood the diagram on the relay switch. It would have been extremely helpful to know how to get through the firewall. I ended up going back to the doorframe (drivers' side) and around the moulding. Hooked the switch up to parking light wire, and the foglights themselves to the battery. I tried hooking the lights up to the wire for the headlights, but that tripped the computer warning system (&#34;Left headlight defective&#34;). There are cables right there (presumably for the foglights) but no switch in the car. The dash and console are impossible to &#34;penetrate&#34; (this is a Ford issue). Ended up putting the switch right next to the light switch cluster. People with longer legs than me, may end up pushing the button with their knee (I'm 1,85 / 5'11&#34;). BTW the advantage to hooking the switch wire to the parking light (at least in Europe), is that the foglights come on when you unlock the door and kill the engine and get out of the car. Gives you that much more light in the parking lot/garage. I seem to recall that the wire is green/purple on the headlight cluster/cable.<br />A bigger problem is the fact that the wires between the foglights are just barely long enough. Another 5 inches of wire would have been good.<br />Ford has put the attachments for the foglights right there behind the rubber cover. However, you can't get to them unless you remove the bottom plastic cover (11 screws and several push thingy's - I replaced the screws but not the push thingy's). I used bolts, locking rings and nuts, to attache the foglights, since there is no way to use the screws that come in the package. All of it is very hard to get to. One bolt I could manage to tighten from the front, the other had to be done from the back (so from under the car). You can (re)place the bulbs by removing the headlamps (2 screws each), but I don't think you can install the foglights from there; you cannot get a hand in there (let alone a tool) and still see what you are doing.<br />The end result looks very nice and undistinguishable from factory fog lights on other Ford Focus I see with foglight. I am less impressed with the amount of light actually cast on the road. I may have to try some different bulbs?<br /><br />This review is 3 stars due to missing instructions (print or video), no way to use the screws to easily attach the foglights, and the short wires between foglights.ou can install the foglights from there; you cannot get a hand in there (let alone a tool) and still see what you are doing.<br />The end result looks very nice and undistinguishable from factory fog lights on other Ford Focus I see with foglight.

B00GHT9G6W|5|Very happy
B00029JXNO|5|Works great and looks great
B012SK41MW|5|Okay - here is what you will want to know about this bar. Out of the box, you will immediately notice that it is well built. All metal construction with solid venting and weatherization. Now, regarding weatherization, I've not owned this long enough to be able to comment on long-term durability but frankly, I don't expect a problem in this department since it's built well. Next, this is not the four foot model like you might have seen on other Jeep light bars...this is a two foot model...if you don't want to use for a jeep then that is fine...this is actually incredibly versatile; so versatile that there are oodles of possibilities - for example, this model can easily be combined with a complimentary set of two work lights sold by this same company to create a trio combination with maximum flexibility ([[ASIN:B00XP38NBC CoolYeah 18W CREE LED Double Row Work Light Offroad Truck Jeep Car Boat ATV SUV (Pack of 2)]] or use as a stand -alone. Can be mounted on cars, trucks, boats, or travel trailers...basically anywhere you want or need a big old light bar.<br /><br />Now, about the actual installation...I'm happy to say this was beyond easy - seriously. If you are a DIY type then this will take 10 minutes. If you are not a DIY type this will still probably take you 10 minutes...seriously, it's that easy. In large part the ease of installation is due to the wiring kit - basically it makes this idiot proof. Here are all the steps required to wire this start to finish:<br /><br />1. Remove from box<br />2. Configure desired placement and install brackets. Connect the lights to power source/battery.<br />3. Run wires from light to interior of cab (or where you want to access the toggle switch for control.<br /><br />In a nutshell that is all that is required. Yes, you can do more or less...you might want to get fancy with the mount or integrate the toggle switch for a more streamlined look but that is all icing on the cake. It's nice to have everything included in one kit without the need to hire outside help for installation. The toggle switch glows red to show a solid connection and glows green when in use. One touch button for easy control. Good illumination thanks to LED lights, this unit runs nice and cool but still has solid construction. This set comes WITH the wiring kit which is also sold separately by this same company. There are also two other lights that match this set perfectly (link mentioned above).

B00XPL88NC|5|This is probably the most rugged and clear read tire gauge I've tried in a long time. It is rugged on the outside and has a very clear-read dial with enough increments to see the exact pressure you need. It's easy to put on and quick to read. I've compared it to a couple of other gauges including the one at the gas station and it is dead on every time.<br /><br />The outside of the gauge is a rugged rubber and will not damage if bounced around. Sample provided for review.
B004HHK886|5|met my expectations
B00A50BQOY|5|Great product. Very happy with it. While parked in a lot, I was apparently bumped and the cover just bent a bit, not cracked or broken.ade very sturdy. Thanks guys!
B006T6VOJA|1|Didn't fit my car
B000FJU8I0|5|Worked perfectly!
B00LGIHYHC|5|Perfect fit to give me more needed counter space in the RV. Would highly recommend this product.
B00LORVOXA|5|Great product
B00QRHDIPY|5|Impressive solar panel for the price.  Not sure that it will hold up to excessive weather, but for a dry summer in California it works great!
B004Q0CLBQ|5|Worked great for my project
B00Y4EFKH6|1|I haven't used them yet because they're orange or maybe anodized gold. My lug nuts are gold and my fog & parking lights are yellow so these supposedly gold (orange) hood bonnets does not in any way match my color coordination.
B00407ANIS|5|Perfect replacement for my mobile home.  Does a good job for not a lot of money
B00M5YC7Q4|5|Switch matches other switches in console and works great.
B006MNLEXQ|5|Just got another one for all my helmets. If you don't have one get one.
B001AVSIOI|5|Works well for my landscape utility trailer. So far no issues as long as I keep it greased. The 90deg key is much easier to use than my old straight in lock.
B000CQRJKG|1|The  quality it's not that description, it looks like any brake shoe, i was super excited but end I'm really disappointed.
B003CMWC4U|1|Description inaccurate.
B00MIZT7OK|5|I haven't used it yet, thankfully, but it's cute and seems like it could do some damaged if used correctly. I took a self defense class in college and wanted to get something small that would help if I was ever in a situation that required it. I'm a small and short female. I keep it in my purse and take it out whenever I feel vulnerable. I have it attached to my pepper spray too.
B0040CWY58|5|These door clips were great for my 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I had enough to replace every single clip on all of my doors and now they are solid. These are sturdy and really cheap for the quality.
B004GCDMKS|1|Did not fit
B00BXLSU48|5|Love the pretty keychain and highly recommend.
B00IEYDEWK|4|The item shipped quickly and will do the job however the advertised photo says it's a loadstar but I did not get a loads tar I got a different tire brand.
B006K8JJ1C|5|Looks to be excellent material and is very nice to form to bends and curves during installation. I am not using a pipe bender, but I am using a flaring tool for the pipe ends and after the learning process, it is going very well. The pipe forms even by hand quite well in fact. I heat the pipe slightly with my hands a bit and then work  areas carefully so not to crease it. What I have found in hand bending is to use touch to continuously check for a crease as it is bent and to scoot down the material. Don't try to make the finished bend all at once because that will surely ruin it. Just take your time and it will work out perfectly. Product was shipped in a box 5 times the manufactures box size and packed with many air bags to keep it safe. I also arrived incredibly fast for moving from UPS to USPS hands. I am very satisfied and would buy again in a second.
B00K0OT2YG|5|Good item fast shipping
B000C54388|5|GREAT PRICE VERY GOOD BRAND FOR THE MONEY FAST SHIPPING AND TRUELY ARRIVE ON TIME
B0024E6UE0|5|Great insect screen! Camco has wonderful, quality products. They offer things I would have never thought about being a first time RV owner.
B000IZ2YTW|5|Installed this and a Dorman 49242 switch in a 1990 GMC van. window works great now. I did end up using my own hardware to fasten the two pieces together. I don't remember for sure but think I used # 10 machine screws and drilled the holes in the motor slightly larger. Rivets would work great as well.
B00N6D7K38|5|I put these into my 2015 F150 and they are amazing. Bright white and they match the color of my LED headlights (Lariat).<br />You can't go wrong with these in my opinion.
B001CF1A6U|5|Simple to install, high-quality
B00WR9ERMO|5|I thought I had the best quick spray wax/detailer there was, and it's is still amazing as a none scratch dry wash. This stuff just blew me away. I just used it on my FJ Cruiser this Morning, And my wife's car this afternoon. Took 20 minutes to do my entire Truck! And 10 minutes to do my wife's car! And WOW! This stuff couldn't be any easier if you tried. And I mean it, I spray, wipe, and then wipe with a dry cloth, but it's really no needed. After the first spray and wipe it's basically done. I wipe the extra just to be sure it's all done, and because I feel it's way to easy without! But really it is the best stuff I've ever tried!! A big Thanks to the manufacturer for making me look so good!! REVIEW MARK 2.  Just received my second delivery in a week of this amazing Teflon spray wax. I just bought one for my Son, he loves his car, and keeps it looking shiny all the time, and now he's excited to use it after my displays of joy on the ease of use and finish you get. And he has to detail his girlfriends car before she returns from her recent trip. He's gonna get big bonus points now. Still amazed about this product. If you are reading this, you will not regret buying this!!
B00OSA2CRW|5|Just what we needed to haul 2 M. Cycles on their trailer, good strength.  So good I ordered more!<br />Make sure if you want a longer length, to scroll through products till you find the length you want. They are here, Just look.
B0028081GK|5|Very good product! It's still working although I don't use it a lot.
B00LM0F5G6|5|Exactly what I needed to replace my Giubo/flex disk.
B000WJF7FC|5|Fast shipping, great lock, love the pager feature.
B00M78820I|5|So far it seems to work well. ”I've tried others but this one is the best.
B00E9HWS9G|5|This does fit a 1994 Honda Accord EX.  I actually didn't trim this one, like I did the Husky driver/shotgun covers.  I needed a catch-all for the back trunk and this fit, as-is, like a catch-all, so just left it without cutting any.
B00Q3IDYY2|5|Worked great with my car. Lowe's did a good job cutting it.
B001QVC5KA|4|Looks good, have not yet had them installed.
B005DZLFV0|5|Fast shipping, great products. Come straight from Dodge Dealer, so therefore they've got a warranty. Bought a set of tow mirrors that came with their own brackets, but used these instead just for the fact they're straight from Dodge.
B008OIW18Y|5|Good quality and my husband likes having a rug supporting his team. Fast shipping too!
B0013LH7RE|4|Took this bag on a 1800 mile trip on a Ducati monster 796.  Held everything needed on the trip.  It does hang down and touch the exhausts a bit, so if you don't have heat shields or a carbon exhaust (like my termi's) it could melt.  Mounting was easy though it made my bike a little cramped.  Probably not an issue on other bikes.  Bought a cargo net to hold my jacket on the hot days and it worked well with the eyelets on the bag.  Good quality bag.  Only down side is the rain cover.  Not quite big enough to hold itself to the bag at speed and wants to come off.  It's partly attached to the front of the bag so you won't lose it if it does come off.  Easy fix though, just hold it down with some bungie cords.  Overall, good quality and hard to beat price.
B0058EDJ9M|5|Works as expected.
B00AJTWSO8|5|A perfect replacement. Easy to install
B00X6DF03K|5|Looks exactly like the photo, fits my 2003 Mazda 6 perfectly. It is also reversible! The other side is just the silver normal looking sunshades that everyone buys. The side shades stick to your windows great!
B007SOODHC|4|Good quality, definitely a fair price, just as advertised, and fast shipping.
B00OFOW708|4|As advertised. Will work well with my solo seat project.
B007ZDDUCK|5|Best leather conditioner I have ever used
B00VEITT22|3|We needed these mats for our 2015 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite. I was close to returning them because they are ugly, the gray color is a bit on the light side, and the front mats do not fit that well. In fact, the front mats do not lay totally flat. They are warped so they stick up a little. We paid about $250, and what we received did not seem to be worth the price.<br /><br />I kept the mats because we needed something to protect the original equipment. These are hard plastic, not rubber like our old one. I think that is why they look so ugly. They are practical, though.<br /><br />We had to take our the second rows seats to put this in because it is one piece that covers 2nd and 3rd row.<br /><br />They cargo mat did fit like a glove, and it is the best mat out of the bunch.<br /><br />In all, I would not buy again, but at least they will work for us. Too bad they are so ugly, though.
B000SXCLIS|5|So far, so good!
B000C5K5Q2|5|Great quality, exactly what I expected
B001UG8S8O|4|The middle star peeled off quickly, but the original Star Trek logo stayed in place.
B00RN6FNW4|5|Great item
B005JU5WI6|5|I have used the Bosch Icon 28&#34; and 17&#34; on my 2009 Altima for 3 years. When it became time for them to be replaced, I tried the Trico Force, but they were horrible, made a lot of noise and chattered on the glass. I then tried PIAA since I have them installed on my mom's Camry, but they so not properly fit against the glass on the drivers side.<br /><br />So I ended up returning back to the Bosch Icon. I got them in today and installed. Cleans well, quiet, and no chattering. When the time comes to replace them again in a few years, I'll stick with Bosch. But I do wish they made a Silicon version like PIAA.
B00MGTS1WW|5|Matches perfectly with the [[ASIN:B0016I8E1M ROLA 59502 2&#34; Steel Cargo Carrier - 2 Piece]]
B001O1TQ5E|5|Just what we were looking for at a great price!
B000ARPVOI|5|I had a check engine light on. I went to autozone and was recommended to try this product before taking my car to the shop. Poured a 3oz bottle in a full tank of gas. Drove my car for about 30 mIles and my check engine light went off. Great product will continue to use. 2006 cadillac sts 107,000 miles.
B00UA9XEB8|2|Description said made in USA. Gauge said made in China. That's BS
B000F6F99G|5|Still going after nearly a year. Other reviews suggest the laser fails. Maybe. But not for me.
B00FJUEO12|5|Great sturdy cart.
B0010E00T6|5|Good  product
B00266Z8JY|3|very dim with only 12 volts
B0002Q80GS|5|Perfect kit to install my Curt Electronic Brake controller 7 pin adapter. Great that it also has the 4 pin hook up for non EBC trailers.
B00D3298A0|5|Great product, great quality, just as described.
B001U7MXE8|4|Definitely as described. Fit well, but it's a LITTLE difficult to close the stairs with the carpets on. Once you get the hang of it, and do it carefully, they close better. Would absolutely buy again.
B005CC372E|3|did not fot my trailer, but refund was easy
B00I2XNWAM|5|I have 4 children in car or booster seats.  I use 2 of these in the back of my car.  It makes is so much easier to buckle the kids in.
B00H47J2CY|4|Look great, packaged well, great price compared with other manufacturers. Can't rate actual performance since the have not been installed and tested at this time.
B00CS9CO6Y|4|love this bag! easy to install and use and stayed still with barely no sounds while driving/moving from IL to NC.
B009DK8JKQ|5|fit well, working
B00D89KXOS|5|Only use new Delphi on gm cars !
B008G1WEK4|3|yes i was happy with my replace lamps ty ty
B009FUF6DM|5|Great deal and great product.
B00VU6YJYG|5|The part looked great and fit better than oem! Delivered right to my door on time in very rural Montana.
B000C2WIQU|5|Did the job! Worked as advertised and fit like a glove. Never had issues with size, and is still holding strong three weeks later. Would not only recommend for the price, but would also definitely buy again. Shipped faster than delivery estimation.  Note: actually bought two different belts ordered seperately from the same seller, on the same day and not only did they arrive on the same day, but in the same box. Awsome! 2 thumbs way up
B00QYIG6C8|5|awesome
B007KCYRZK|5|Awesome buy!!!  Thanks!
B004C6OBBC|5|As advertised!
B005H4EZWI|3|Not streak free.  They are very thin compared to the Griots waffle towels; I would recommend those over these.  These are a lot cheaper, but you get what you pay for.
B000BZL08A|5|Excellent Product, just as advertise
B00LIB49ES|5|Beautiful lights. Look great on my black 95 Tahoe. Good buy. But I would suggest using the old clips from your lights for bolting them back in. Because the ones that come with these strip out super easily. But for the money, you can't go wrong.
B001O81PNI|1|Had a clunk in the front end this part fixed it for 3 days
B00H8DFKS4|1|I installed the taillights first they didn't work.
B000K7HA9W|3|Love it, at time and hate it at times.....Good quality product overall !
B00NPYXAWS|5|Very satisfied.
B009EKR55U|4|My 2001 Honda Accord which has over 200,000 miles had orange engine light on.<br />I purchased engine diagnostic tool and checked to see what was wrong with the car.<br />It indicated that the Catalytic converter was not doing its job so I researched online and purchased this product.<br /><br />I struggled a lot taking the bolts out because it was rusted and melted so I had to use powerful air impact wrench to take the bolt out.<br />Basically it ripped the bolts out.<br /><br />After that it was a breeze.<br /><br />This product had a nice fit and there was no problem fitting the sensor back in.<br /><br />After installing new Cat. the engine light was gone after few hours and the car is normal again.  Somehow I feel like the car is running more smoothly.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars you may ask?<br /><br />1. It does not come with the exhaust Gasket so I had to do extra research to find the exact match.<br />You need Walker 31645 Exhaust Gasket and 31383 Gasket.  Front and back are different shape.<br />I ordered right gaskets the first time but what if I ordered wrong one...  They should include Gaskets.<br /><br />2. It does not come with nuts and bolts.  Maybe they want you to reuse your old ones but lot of times the bolts get stuck because of the rust and extreme heat, etc.  They should include nuts and bolts.
B001U60T9U|4|This covers are not made for 2015 corolla i had to do some work cutting holes in the rear backrest covers to make em fit ...besides that the product is great and they look nice on my car,  i will rate 4 stars for good product and fast delivery other than that it made me put on some work in this thing lol
B00522S2M4|5|It's a brand new, genuine Mopar part that's completely identical to the factory original. You really can't go wrong with this one.
B005TIV1AQ|5|Shipped fast! Went on easily! Installed it by myself. Works wonderfully!  Very pleased!
B00CMOFV0G|4|Great price, the 3m is pretty much garbage, but they look really, really nice on the bike. Blacklight coloring. About as bright as you would expect for the price. I will probably order another set to get some more coverage
B000CMDJ3Q|2|The were so-so..Bought used
B005FK3PQQ|5|Bough for a 2005 Mazda 6i. Was very easy to install and it works great! No brake noise and doesn't rust while sitting over a weekend like my former OEM replacements did.
B003TLWV40|1|worked for about 40 starts
B0009JKGJC|5|Perfect
B00UMOJ4CE|5|Great shipping fast
B00T7DR7FW|4|No wiring diagram... I attached one to help!
B000ARPVNO|5|thank you good deal
B006E4SKQ2|4|Fit my 2014 honda civic perfectly.
B00JF8SGWM|5|I like it
B000E2CVI8|5|Much easier to install and remove than the factory filters.
B00499ZFZ8|1|Used these for Both day time running lights on my jeep.They only lasted 4 months before burning out. My OEM lights lasted nearly 4 years!
B000Q71N8K|5|Much larger than the last one I bought here and runs quiet.  I am an over the road truck driver and needed something I could put my drinks in and my lunchmeat.  My other cooler was not large enough and was cool enough to keep both so this is a money saver for sure.  Works great.
B001T9QZOG|5|Part worked great on my BMW.  Direct fit replacement for OEM part.
B004VT8C42|5|Best looking tail lights. fit is perfect
B00K8EX1Z4|5|Exact duplicate of original equipment.  Fast delivery, too.
B0012WHBSO|5|These are the best compressors for auto use.
B000FIXQXK|5|Loctite 242 world well on smaller screws that tend to loosen form vibration and shock. I use the product on firearm screws that need it like scope mounts.
B000FUNZF2|5|Really good rust preservation!!!!
B00OGPSV5Q|5|I have a 1992 Toyota pickup and have had a hard time finding seat covers that fit. These fits perfectly, were easy to install and seem to be a good quality cover that will last for quite some time.
B00IKXW45S|5|Fits and works perfectly. Really helps my back on long trips in the truck. Stays in place. Get it, you will love it.
B000WJ6H4W|5|My parts came in quickly and were exactly what I needed
B00HE68GCC|3|The brush kind of sucks for applications but it'll do. best results would be to touch up after it dries with sand paper and do your own clear coat.
B002SAQ2BG|4|wouldn't know the difference between a good and a bad antifreeze... live in the south.
B00GRRFLOK|5|great product, easy to install and sturdy.  Thanks again
B000L9AD2K|3|The design and how loud the compressor was good.  The bad part was that it blew fuses each time I used it.  I tried it in two different cars and had to replace the 12V fuses in both vehicles.  I would not buy this again or recommend it.
B0070I8386|5|Bought these for my 09 GTI and then again for the 10 GTI.  Improve handling and grip quite a bit, steering becomes more direct.  There is a slight increase in noise over bumps but it's tolerable.  They function similar to traction bars on other cars.  The first time I pressed out the stock bushings, but they have plastic sleeves and in retrospect they can probably just be cut out.  New bushings press in easily by hand.  You can mark the original bolts to put everything back without a torque wrench or an alignment.  If you're doing more suspension work it's a good time to add these and then get it aligned.
B0013UBC7Q|5|Sound is amazing on my old Chevrolet. Would buy again for sure.
B001CEG90I|5|good fit and easy replacement - timely delivery
B0002SA3WA|5|Good material and great product. Looks awesome.
B00NM6UC52|3|It doesn't work for my bike like Amazon said it would
B00065L2D8|3|clips are to small, doesn't fit properly around the battery cable
B004HAG7K6|5|these are great!  use them for everything.  will be buying more!!
B00B9Z86F6|5|Excellent
B008BAH6F8|5|You can't find redbone coonhound stuff anywhere, and I loved this sticker. Totalled the car it was on. So I suppose I'll have to get another.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Does not look like the original that comes in the newer models.<br />Turned extremely yellow after ONE day in the sun.<br />Does not come in one piece.<br />Come as the base and a sticker that you glue over the base, meaning it's up to you to align it and make sure it's perfectly centered<br />Looks terrible now.<br />Don't waste your money.
B010JRL2MS|5|Great product, it came in individual plastic bags  when I recieved it. No scratches and nice gloss finish. Perfect fit on the vehicle, also very cost effective. Easy installation.
B00CO24YVS|1|Parts fit fine. But they were completely gone after 30 days and less than 300 miles. Definitely not worth the time it takes to install.
B005C57QXW|5|As discribed, and in a timely manner
B0031XULF2|5|Great price, fast delivery. Exactly as viewed. Thanks
B00CE2L97A|5|The sound and quality is great
B00LN3QT2G|5|Installed a pair on an older grain combine where the lights have become a bit tired.  They illuminate the platform very well.  A bit stronger beam in the center, but works well as a flood light. A much whiter light compared to the old floods, but I like it better for this type of application.  Highly recommended.
B000TRBOK4|4|Happy to have this for camper.
B0002SR2RY|5|If you need to change out an oil pressure switch, get this. It makes the job easy, and you can't do the job without it.
B00LPS57A4|5|Exactly as expected.  Nice weight.  Seems to be durable.  Shipping a little pricey for such a light item.
B00062YVIY|4|Worked great!
B00JH2FO1C|5|Perfect! Took maybe 1 min to program the key fob!
B0010DQWBM|5|Perfect description,  fit perfectly, arrived on time.
B00E9G1F0K|5|Great service, fast, good price and it works great, thank you
B007RRTUT6|5|These are a good buy, not super Yellow and EZ to install in Harley Davidson, Passing Lights.
B000A8QLUA|5|Excellent
B001AH5BG0|5|Seems to be a quality part. It installed just fine and ran well.
B001NKS45Y|1|Piece of crap worked for 2 hours and then failed. Stranded me in the middle of the river
B000B8GAPK|5|The perfect fit.
B0052YDXRQ|5|Excellent
B003O0YKYK|5|Easy to install and fixed the problem within 10 minutes with no tools.  Thanx.
B00J594AQ2|1|Must have been frozen , will not cure.
B00JVX0N1I|5|A wonderful upscale product and exactly what I was looking for and needed.
B00ILJM21W|5|Fit as expected on my 13' CRV
B003VPS89Q|5|Perfect !!
B002S0C46S|3|Bought for a 2002 audi a4.<br />Unit worked but it is not a direct replacement. I had to make a spacer for the mounting and the wiring attaches at a different angle.unit works good.
B00RWA3ZYE|5|The lights look great and where easy to install in my xv crostrek but the lights are Moe purple than blue but as a blue fanatic they look great
B000E4VC72|5|Worked exactly as it should, and it was simple to install.
B007PKC6KK|5|Does what it's supposed to do.  Purchased to mount on my motorcycle.  Easy to read, has a light and keeps accurate time.
B00SS14WU2|5|Easy to install...great look
B005VUQZQW|5|Original GM part, even came with hardware.
B00Q5E4LV4|4|Seems to be working. I haven't done anything crazy like leave food in the car but car doesn't smell like dog which is why I purchased it. Very attractive - stylish.
B000GZHR14|5|Got the cheap off brand floorboards since I couldn't get these ones and ended up replacing them.  Do yourself a favor: buy these ones instead.  The quality and finish are superb and the chrome is thick.  Love them.
B000IG5PZQ|5|I use this in the shower. Up high in the corner where it will probably never get wet. Its inexpensive enough that I was willing to try it over a more expensive waterproof clock. I used the sticky back provided on the clock to attach to the shower tile. Had this for a few months and would by again.
B0025272PW|5|Mann is an OEM supplier to Audi/VW, same quality but w/o the Audi/VW logo and markup.  This is for my 2008 (B6 generation) VW Passat with the 3.6 VR6 engine.
B00404WDUC|5|Had to install attachment for use on my Harley Bagger...wish fitting was a little smaller for those hard to reach places. Otherwise great gauge and like the release air function
B002R38TCE|4|Some Untrimmed and loose hair. Has to clean the top with a lint remover (sticky)
B00LP7RJ4W|1|Can't get them on my plate
B00BAOJEMK|4|Looks good and fit perfect.  Only problem I had was one of the balbs was bad
B0012GTVVA|5|Wife loves it, wish I had bought before now.
B00IO9BU26|5|awesome
B00KXE3Q3Q|5|A Plus
B00IGZPIPI|5|This job took over 2 hours but is fixed the problem
B001PNU0Z6|5|Exactly what I expected.
B00SC6ZRP2|1|We bought this to be able to use with our son's car seat instead of having to dig for the seatbelt each time we get in the car. We have a 2013 Hyundai and it doesn't fit our car.
B00DZI5CS4|5|Amazing design, fast shipping and nice light helmet. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. I'm
B00LE6OO3I|2|These taillight assemblies have the same appearance as the original equipment, but when I attempted to plug them into the vehicles wiring harness, it was apparent that there were multiple, significant differences. The pin arrangement didn't match, meaning that one pin went to a dead socket.  The sockets couldn't be pressed together far enough to click shut. The electrical connectors weren't sealed, but were open to the elements, which would have resulted in the connections corroding quickly. The color coding on the wiring had no correlation to the original wiring.  I cut the original connectors off the old assemblies and soldered them correctly to the new lights. They work fine, but the work required to make them work negated the cost savings.  Also, the bulbs supplied for the turn signals were the tiny type designed for side marker lights, and didn't even show up in the daytime. The backup bulbs were the same tiny bulbs. I had to replace all four with the proper bulbs.  I would not recommend purchasing these.
B0065263IU|5|Great product I mean this seat really sticks happy I purchased it.
B0002UEN1A|5|I used this product as a filler around a cabochon stone set into a ring. Works great! Looks nice, filling the small gaps and is not noticeable.
B004TQZHNQ|5|Came quickly and mounted perfectly and high quality.
B007RPTJMQ|5|Great quality, looks great, easy installation
B0007XQ3CE|5|Keep in mind that you should probably just fork-over the money for that larger version since it is the same 3M cherry wash.
B00MB01MT0|1|At first these boots look great! They fit perfectly. We used them once, they got wet, and the metal literally RUSTED overnight! We rode for 4 hours. Came home, rinsed the boots off and in the morning the screws on the buckles-black screws mind you-were so rusted by morning that you could clearly see they were now rust. The metal toe plate also rusted overnight! I bought these for my son. I still have my 20 year old boots I used to race and they have Zero rust! Sad that O'Neal would lower their quality to this poor level.
B004WO8ONK|5|Great shocks on a 2000 Jeep Cherokee XJ - they smooth the ride, but feel tighter and more controlled, just what you expect from Bilsteins.
B007HA7TWS|5|God price and worked perfect !!
B006BE0ZBS|5|good price fast shipping
B00B5KYS9I|4|Great instructions, great quality material, but I couldn't for the life of me get the staples to work properly... Maybe it's because I'm a &#34;girl&#34; without any upper body strength, but I just couldn't get it to staple down... If you're clever, you can figure out how to affix it without staples, and it does the job!  Much better than having an old cracked and torn console cover in my car!
B000C9IMPE|5|It is an authentic GM part the one to use for Supercharge intake air temperature on your Ford.
B000BZYXU2|5|Fit my caliper just fine.
B00IEF7CDG|5|Actually very good
B00E1M7EXO|5|it was jst what I needed
B00396HCSA|4|Had to get a replacement. The high side coupler wasn't QC'd when it left the factory or something. The O-ring closest to the knob was pinched and sticking half way out. Needless to say I lost some refrigerant when I hooked it up. Guess I should've examined everything a little more closely before using them. I am kind of disappointed in the plastic gauge housings though. You would think that Robinair would make them out of some cheap pot metal or something other than plastic. The replacement set I ordered came in quickly and had no issues.
B000JQQQKS|3|Not bad buy for what they are great size choices same good for my boat cover may buy again
B000FA91DC|3|The hing section did not fit the opening on my fifth-wheel trailer, and I had to modify the article with a hacksaw.
B009C0MNAY|5|Great Bag. Good Price.
B00230MECM|4|Works great for lowtops or anything with a standard shoe front.  For anything clunky, don't use, it won't fit right....but if you are using it for that, why have this?  Well made, does what it is supposed to do.
B007J7E3I2|5|Exactly as described
B005WTPAZO|5|Extremely satisfied with product and speedy delivery!!!
B004OFNJZ0|5|These are great ! I wanted something other then basic silver and these are perfect. Since there are 2 of them they fit in most windows.
B005J6JRMM|2|Not compatible with Toyota Forerunner center back seat. Works great for all other seats in the vehicle but unfortunately we need it for the center back seat for my sons booster seat.
B0081SCR1S|5|Used it on a coach purse and leather boots great product .. I gave it a four star because I think the price is way too high
B00DBEPOVW|2|same
B000Z0HVHA|5|Great product
B00X5S0WKC|5|delivered on time,fit perfectly, works great on my 07 Harley Davidson!
B000WJGKIK|5|Good perch and handle and a good price.  This is the one I go to for all my non-competition bikes.  It's a great value.
B008JORKP2|5|Wonderful product! Worked great for our camping trips when we couldn't have a real fire, everyone was jealous! :-)
B0014476YE|2|It's 4.5 inches not 5.
B00SYRVIAC|3|Some of the decal stuck to the backing  paper  was able to use most of it.
B0006JLW84|5|Strong lid!
B00JVHLS3G|1|Fell off after a week. Boo
B00KZ3201O|3|For this amount of money I expected something a little more 'sturdy'. I hope it lasts longer than a year of daily use.. Not even a cap/cover provided.
B00M5YC7Q4|5|Wired this guy up to my LED light bar. Directions are alright and anyone with a brain can figure out how the wiring works. I intentionally left one of the wires unplugged so that the blue LED wasn't on all the time when the car was off. The blue light when the light is on however is very nice. Very high quality switch.
B00DPNBXHI|4|Fits as it should and protects the carpet. Well made and is easy to adjust for seat up or down.  So far a great purchase.
B0070Y35GU|5|Very nice seller. I like the product. It just started coming off from the bottom a little bit so make sure u stick it good.
B0085E3JQU|5|This enclosure fits like a glove. It is also easy to install. It is a good price for the quality.
B000MQ6L0U|5|Makes the bike look good as well as helps with high speed wobble on the highway. Keeps coolant temp down as well
B00HE67TS4|5|Touch up paint works great. I am very happy with my purchase.
B002E3FXB2|4|I got this Reese to put on my 2008 Honda Element LX. It BARELY fit in. Maybe my car's frame is wonky, but this was a pain to install. BUT... now I've got a hitch. ;)
B002DVTAKU|5|Great solution for a troublesome problem.  The kit was perfect and easy to work for a repair of a pop-up tail light.
B0049VZN8U|2|This does not fit a standard 1 1/4 &#34; receiver. The hole is in the wrong place.
B00PSD5O28|5|Perfect. Exactly what I need. Fits my 2001 Sport Trac. Delivered on time.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|date received excellent product
B00750BMJG|5|Cheap and does the job
B001EOWRUW|5|It fit perfectly in the back of my husband's truck!
B007ZPMPQA|5|I bought this for my granddaughter's first car. Very lovely, good size, fit perfectly on the visor and was shipped in a very timely manner.
B003D1QVJ2|5|Great lugs Honda original and easy installation
B002EDT4AS|5|Very pleased. Quality workmanship. Attractive in tan. Easy to install.
B002S4EVR4|2|The zipper broke when I while I was affixing it to the back of the rear seats. Very cheap quality zipper. Aside from that it does what it needs to but now I have first aid equipment scattered around my trunk
B0031ZDU62|1|Purchased thinking it would be a great deal n trusted the quality. They have been installed now for a couple months and already have had 2 fail. Good for a quick fix but get OEM for quality.
B00NT9IN12|4|I bought this item because I have a Honda Fit and since the battery is so small it has been know to lose the charge when not being driven often.  I haven't used the Spider for charging the car battery since I purchased but I wanted it as back-up if I could not start my car. However in order to try it out,  I have charged my phone, my Kindle and my notebook computer.  It charges these devices quickly and it is easy to see how much charge the Spider still has in order to know when to charge up the Spider.  I got the Spider version specifically as it has a wall charger; I don't leave the Spider in my car so the wall charger was more practical for me.  It comes in a good, well organized, soft case and is very light and easy to take around.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great, easy to put in and take off windshield
B00P9OF04I|5|So I was a bit skeptical about this requiring only 2 steps and if it would work for my parents' old van but boy did it work like a charm. Our 2003 Chrysler town and country has 249k miles on it and has always been parked outside (we live in Michigan), so the weather has obviously took a toll on its exterior, including the headlights which have never been treated! Very impressed and quick, only took me about 20 minutes which is why I got this over others seeing the good reviews on how quick this one is compared to others with about 5 steps that require an hour. Get this kit! You will not be disappointed!<br />I even did it on my friend's 1999 Honda Cr-V with 190k miles and it did a miracle, even better than on the minivan<br /> I have included pictures of before and after and I never post pictures for review but was so impressed with this that I felt like posting some so others can do the same.<br />One thing to note, it seems that you probably will run out of spray before you run out of the scrubbing compound, though fortunately, Meguiars now sells the spray on its own
B00FXLJ8U4|5|Well made. Can't use it, thank God
B00NNFT09G|1|Doesn't fit 05 accord 15&#34; factory wheels
B00AIJY2ZM|5|gerat light pricey but really bright used for my main courtesy light
B0081RXLQY|5|Very quiet and low dust brake pads. I use these on an Audi A6 and work great. Excellent price too. :-)
B00JW1X2GC|5|Works as advertised. I purchased mine on Amazon and from a distributor in Korea (Wootek Mobile) so if you don't mind waiting about 10 business days, it's identical to what you'd buy at the local auto part dealer for three times the price.  .  As for installation on a 2008 Hyundai Azera, there is a way to install without having to remove the dash cover.  Provided you have offset tools and can contort your body, and have some patience, it can be done just by removing the glove box.
B00BP4LM6Q|5|Very nice and excellent quality. Love it.
B008ZE1Q7Y|5|Works great. I have to use finger nail to unlock the pressure lock<br />Only issue I have is the label for the pressures is coming off. I will need to find another way to see what the pressure is. The label coming off is due to use, not poor construction though
B000BO4WZY|5|good stuff
B000TQ6P40|5|Worked great!!! Strongly recommend it
B00V5J6AD6|5|2010 F150... Easy to install in driveway, still keeps factory rake but gave me a 3&#34; overall gain in height.
B00KJ8C1AK|3|I hope it performs well and rides nice without a spring flying out of place.
B007EDNPIU|4|Came fast but was a little too big up in the front area of the seat
B00029XG0A|5|On a 2013 JKU with Mopar installed steel bumper and WARN 8000 winch( by dealer, this fairlead was a direct bolt on. I replaced the OEM hawse plate as the winch cable would surely wear faster sliding on the rough hawse. All four rollers were well centered and rolled sweet.  I purchased the 2013 JKU used with only 4,800 miles on it and it was garage kept. The young Mom to be had triplets and the Jeep had to go.<br /><br />Measure bolt spacing many times. The spacing was a perfect match for my bumper. The fairlead comes with two sets of holes. The center most set is the one to use with proper strength fasteners.
B004ME8MZ0|4|Mirrors shake a little while driving. For the price they do the job. A little hard to get get them on.
B00784W9OG|5|thank you
B00LBIIBMO|5|I've tried five different makes/brands of angel eyes, and these are the best! They are bright and the metal housings seem very solid and durable (several other brands have thin plastic locking tabs that break very easily - leaving the bulbs loose and subject to vibrating out of their sockets in the back of the headlight assembly).<br /><br />My only minor complaint with these is that they have two connections in series, per bulb, instead of just a single connector that plugs directly into the factory wiring harness.  I'm guessing the manufacturer does this so they can easily change the BMW factory connection at the end of the line, and thereby use the main bulb housing for several different BMW models/years, but it would still be better for me if they took the trouble to eliminate the extra connector/wire bulk.
B00ONHN2EW|5|Fit my 96 grand caravan perfectly, easy installation and good quality bulbs were included with the purchase
B00HQLM0HW|5|Fits perfectly, Amazing quality doesn't peel or fade
B00HQIUZS6|1|While I have installed 1 or 2 pumps that were harder, this one takes about 6 hours. And to have the impeller fall off the shaft ( yes completely off the shaft to rest against the pump housing ) on the trucks first run was a expensive ordeal for me. Luckily it was not to far from the shop. The $180 I was saving over the OEM from Cummings dealer does not look so good now.
B00H15WIV6|4|The headlights look great! I love this color over the 6000k because it is a nice clear white without any blue. I have a 2006 Dodge Magnum R/T and they complement the car well.<br /><br />My issue with the bulbs is the installation. It was nearly impossible to get them in there and took at least a half hour between using a dremel to reshape the plastic pieces so that they would fit better and finally aligning them correctly. Once they were in and connected to the ballast everything was kosher. The lights do not flicker and are very bright though, so I am happy.
B000BKSJQ6|4|They work great two years then they die,have replace them
B00HRSTNGU|4|These LEDs are much brighter than the stock lights. The only issue that the LED light that goes into the rear cargo area is too big and does not fit properly, which results in the light falling out when switch the light on/off. However, all of the other lights fit fine. Also, because these LEDs emit a blue-ish light, I wouldn't recommend them for tan interiors, it just night not look right.<br /><br />I do like the look and brightness with the gray interior... if only that one LED bulb was a little smaller and fit properly, I would have given it 5 stars.
B00SLL7972|1|It has a leak at the low side port and can't even return or replace the part.
B00I50553E|5|Real easy install. Taking off the tie rod end makes it ALOT easier and faster. I love the way my 05 F150 sits now
B009DJX574|5|Arrived quickly. Quick and easy replacement. Thanks to the jerk who hit our car in the parking lot and just took off! ::sarcasm::
B00II3M86U|3|Good light distribution pattern, fairly bright (although LED's are always improving and there are brighter one's out there now), and I really like the warmer color temperature of these compared to others I have. We use these in our RV for kitchen and bathroom lighting, as well as for our exterior porch light.   *****12/3/15 update. After using the bulbs for approximately 6 months (used 1-2 days a week during that time), each unit has had 1/3 to 1/2 of the individual LED cells go out. I am downgrading my review to a 3, but this is giving them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I got a bad batch.
B00Q026Q2I|5|Works exactly as you would expect.  No problems.
B007WR66QQ|5|Worked great in my 2012 vw gti stock
B003CEJXGI|5|cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.
B00429NKWK|2|The product is good and cleans the lens very well. If the manufacturer had not claimed the product is guaranteed to last as long as you own the car, then I could have given five stars. But a huge chunk in the decision to buy this product was the warranty. I really did not want to have to clean the yellow haze from my head lights but the one time. And I plan on keeping my car. If you are cleaning up your car to sell, by all means. But that was not my situation. So, you can imagine my disappointment when after the first year, I began to notice a haze developing over the left head lamp. Within another year both head lamps had frosted over in a dull sheen (I used the kit in the fall of 2012). By this summer it was as if you could not tell they had been cleaned. Both head lamps were yellowed and dulled, and light beam was drastically reduced. Bear in mind, it took 10 years for my car's head lamps to yellow the first time. Only two the second time after cleaning -- by the numbers -- with the Sylvania kit. I could not find the receipt for the kit purchased in 2012, but am keeping the receipt for the second kit I used last week in the glove compartment so I will have it. $19 is not much, and it certainly doesn't cover the investment of time that was wasted. I have some UV coating remaining and I may try touching up with that after six months to see if that helps. I have a RAV4, and the head lamps are not that large, so product quantity is more than ample. My car is not garaged and sets out in the Missouri weather 24/7. If your car is garaged this warranty may work for you.
B00B2POFE4|4|This was really nice print & material,  just didn't fit a Silverado back bench seat like I thought.. the Zebra isn't even centered in each seat, kinda ghetto. But I made it work..
B00F8LEB9W|2|Did not work on my Ford Focus. However, a letter of &#34;complaint&#34; resulted in a refund without needing to return the fobs. So actaully: no complaint!
B00GOQFIR4|4|They work great, easy to install, look good.  I just needed bigger ones.
B008ZE8VRC|5|Excellent product! Works well Sounds Great! Improves performance!
B00JEMS9LM|5|It was just the right size.
B00513G82U|5|Good product but the instructions were/are the worst I have ever seen.  Product surpassed my expectations and I would defintly recomend it.
B0041DY0CG|5|Perfect fit in my 06 and works like a champ. With free shipping it was cheaper than online auto parts stores and way less than local shops.
B0010E00T6|3|It's ok but it was just a bit tight fit on my 2012 Honda Civic
B000EQP8NE|5|Great
B004VWETFU|4|Only negative to say is you have to remove the V-shaped wedge after each time and reinsert each time you go to load your trailer.  That was an unexpected and disappointing surprise.
B000COBLNE|5|Great, works as expected
B00W8DBZQU|5|Half the price the dealer charges. Well worth the money, and a perfect fit.
B00Q0TIGSS|5|These lights fit my Heritage Classic, though it took a little work getting the chrome ring on the headlight.  The new light sticks out a little farther than the original.  I love the daytime visibility, they work great.
B000C7YQ2E|5|Worked like a charm.....thanks again
B00IN4DYG2|5|Exactly as I expected. Worked perfectly. Looks good.
B005EV95O2|5|Really nice upgrade for a good price, prefect fit. Polished stainless steel pieces that use 3M (red) two sided tape to attach. A picture's worth a long description.
B00JLVHY4Y|5|These arrived as expected. They came folded in a box but a short time in the sun flattened them out nicely. I had no problem at all figuring which went in what spot. It took all of two minutes. I have had them about a month now and they are snug and doing their job.
B009DJUV30|1|the material is to thin waste of money
B00LM55LDI|5|I can't tell you how many compliments I get from the smell of my car with these things. Such a pretty powder smell. :)
B0006JLU22|5|Easy to install
B000JFJLP6|5|Have now had it almost 5 yrs. gets used daily in an Auto Shop/Road service environment. normally only Charge it once every few days.<br /><br />Had one that was over 10 yrs old and saw the same use.
B007KPV1MY|5|Works fine and was easy to install.
B000GQA8DC|3|It still fits a little loose and it cheaply made but it is better than having nothing in the middle
B000GZCUAC|5|Went into my RSX -S. Everything was in spec. Just went right in. Should last atleast 50k miles.
B0097CDPBI|5|this product works great for a year, then you will need another as they do wear out.  However, great product and will buy again when needed.
B000C9QKOY|5|Really a must have for an older truck. All aftermarket brands in local stores are junk compared to these shocks.
B00O8W5SNU|3|the light looked great when plugged in,  easy install, but didn't actually fit in my 2011 Tahoe. and you don't figure that out until they r plugged in the whole light fixture and you go to re install the light fixture. the housing on the back of the bulb unit (fan) was an inch too deep. the battery blocked it on one side and the air cleaner on the other. so this model doesn't fit in 2011 tahoes.
B001TXWNLQ|1|Not working
B00NB7XHD6|5|I got this key for my 2011 Jeep Patriot. I took it to the dealership for programming. After it was programmed the key would start the car but the buttons still didn't unlock the car. After talking to Neil and having him try different things the key works and I'm very happy with the service I received!
B003RQBKLC|5|Since one of my charging ports doesn't work, this is super handy.
B0017ODU9G|4|Low cost, free shipping, came fast, and ....  it worked!
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Item arrived in time and in good shape.  The one piece shade is more convenient to deploy and store than the two piece shade I had been using.  It is larger and should give better coverage.  It has been cloudy here since I received the shade so I haven't had occasion to need it, so I can't comment on how effective it is at keeping the interior temperature down.  My rear view mirror is attached to the windshield and there is no cutout or other provision for this on this shade: however, I don't think this will be a real problem.  The shade is large enough to get good coverage even when pulled down to give clearance for the mirror.
B0009JKI86|1|bought this blade for 2008 gmc sierra 1500. amazon said it would fit and it does not.
B0058EK88M|4|Great price!  Very generic carpets,  don't fit perfect for my truck but they do the job!
B0016ODIKS|1|Filter I received was defective, it would not spin on.
B000CGRMLC|4|Ordered these for the low dust aspect. They work great. They have more dust than I had hoped but they are still a great improvement from any stock use.
B00F8M7CQ0|5|This pump delivers fuel to the engine,  if too much fuel is delivered the engine will explode with a fiery explosion resulting in death.
B003VXRPL0|5|Didn't know our federal government banned this companies blue-colored version.  Unfortunately, I could have used this color-change to make my brake bleed suck less.
B000JFHNQA|5|This is my 3rd Booster PAC. I've been an auto mechanic for 19 years and people at my job borrowed my first one and destroyed it. I have one now that wasn't charging so I bought a new one only to find out that the charger was bad. It's a few years old but still works great so I brought the older one home and kept the new one at work. Highly recommended. Long cables and I get a bunch of jumps between charges.
B00VH643H2|5|You can use these towels in every room & the garage!  I never have enough towels. I decided earlier this year to quit buying paper towels. It hadn't worked out too well until I got these for a reduced cost for an honest opinion. I can use them for the walls, the floors, the dishes, dry for dusting & hundreds of other chores. Not to mention the car-inside & out. When they get dingy, I will just bleach them in the wash.  These are a good size-bigger than a washrag. I can even use them for washrags. I love these & will buy some more. No more paper towels! Thank You!
B008G1Z3J8|5|great item ,perfect fit
B00AU9V8WU|5|Fits my 2013 FJ perfectly and took less than one minute to install. It also matches the stock driver's side armrest perfectly.
B003S8BRHQ|5|Worked well.  Saved me $50 compared to what the dealer was charging.
B00LFX3BKW|3|I want prospective buyers to pay CLOSE attention to the size (dimensions) of this *little* tray.  It is precisely as it has been pictured; they show it accurately and honestly, and I give them credit for that.  But be aware that it is precisely & accurately depicted; and some people might tend to label it SMALL.<br /><br />It's really small.  For a tablet it will be ideal, and I would think a soft drink cup and a donut would be just fine, but a laptop?!  I doubt it.<br /><br />Anyway - nothing nasty or negative - just be aware of what you're buying.  If you have any doubts, cut out a piece of cardboard and do a little eyeballing in your car.
B003D29R7O|3|These came with the cheapest worst quality clamps one can imagine using on an exhaust pipe. The newer JBA 1775SX's come with stainless band clamps though. The merge welding looked like it was done by a 5 year old. I found excessive wires left over, and the weld is so thick that I think they used the welds to cover up mistakes during cutting of the pipes. The flanges are beefy though but the protection they used during shipment didn't seem to prevent damage to the flanges and pipe ends (their protection is some bubble wrap taped together).<br /><br />I heard rumors that Pypes just copied JBA's pipes for the 05-10 Mustangs, but honestly, my Pypes XFM23 X-pipe has a merge weld that looks like it was done by a robot. The weld is immaculate with no excess material on the inside or outside - it is as smooth as a baby's bottom.<br /><br />Overall: 3/5 stars, substandard exhaust clamps (newer versions will have the proper band clamps), terrible merge weld quality
B000CF6RX2|5|These installed very easily. The only issue is your automatic window stop will cause you to override manually. Make sure you follow directions and leave windows up for 24 hours. This Will seat the deflectors so they don't cause your window to roll back down.
B00KVPNURO|5|I'Started the conditioner on August 11, went two weeks to 24th.Opened up My RV Water heater tank ,pushed some Creosote to my hot line in Kitchen run slow but opened up hotline now  and flushed out This works great at opening up pipes and smooth water feel. at 2.00.00 per month to by table salt at 50 cents each is cheap  out.all other line running great under PSI. 28 days is two boxes. I wrapped in Insulation and duck tape for winter. and put it in a 5 gal bucket. and put blocking around the cylinder to keep it standing up put under neath the trailer.The inbound line from the back up water filter helps to.
B0009JKGK6|5|I usually run this stuff every so often. More as a system cleaner in the fuel. In the older cars, like 20 years and more, depending on what is going on, it may be in the fuel and oil. Every so often, I will have something come up that could force a major tear down. Out comes the MMO. It is rare I have seen it let me down. Bottom line, it is a great tried and true product. You may wish to see my response comments in someone's one star posting here.
B004AIDBZO|5|Fit was perfect for my 2004 silverado Z71.  It comes out of the box set for the transfer case to be in neutral. I didn't need to drop the front shaft to install this, just unscrewed and was able to lower the motor.
B00FH8P1DG|5|For the price this light bar is awesome. Super bright. I took some advice from another review on here that said to seal it when you get it. So I got a silicone windshield repair thing and ran a bead across the whole outside of the frame where it holds the glass in place and it has seemed to work well, I haven't had any leaks and I've had it on about 6 months now. Mine didn't come with any wiring harness, so I used a 30amp fuse, a relay and a switch and it is working well.
B00ONI3ABG|5|Proud to be a cheesehead.  This makes my car look phenomenal.
B0055XHBHC|5|We are very pleased with this mattress
B00NPPNKTU|4|Well constructed and very bright. I used as extra back-up lights on my Sierra 1500
B00BK7MHOE|5|Great stuff, all your GM needs
B00TU9FUNE|5|Very good quality.looks awesome.
B00JIEX722|5|Using these as license plate lights in my dad's 2014 Cadillac ATS.  So far they work and look great!
B002DPTQX2|4|When we used it the ground was solid so were unable to secure the stand.  We had to put our satellite just on the ground.  But I'm not giving up on the tripod - next time we go camping, the ground will not be so hard - hopefully.
B000C40SR4|5|Great shocks for F150 Truck. Nice firm ride.
B001HR443Y|5|Good stuff
B00AQZAWMK|5|Arrived as described, fit perfectly and saved me a trip to the dealer parts dept.
B000EVWDU0|5|Does the job, in the end not all that practical for me. Get ODBII instead.
B00HHHX63M|5|I'm very pleased with the lights. I installed two under my rear bumper for reverse lighting on my truck. They are very bright and the slimmest I've seen for my application.
B0068EQYHK|5|Good product and excellent delivery time!
B0002JMUXO|5|I have an F250, 7.3L diesel.  It pays to use Motorcrdaft parts most of the time.
B00C1L0SZI|5|works perfectly with the Lowerance LMF-400.  practically plug and play
B00F5MU9MW|5|love it - perfect for the RV
B009WQPWVK|5|Cant beat the price
B00N2K6M2A|1|Didn't work
B009IFIB0Y|5|Easy to install and a lot less than dealership wanted!
B00AZA34U8|5|worked great and easy to install
B0033S2FIG|5|perfect
B004YGEOZS|5|It worked great!
B0022Y6S9Y|5|Great Bar. look awesome.
B00DKWJ9VG|4|It's great<br /><br />But does not fit well on my F-350 windshield
B00167Y3ZO|5|Great fit, great blade at a good price. Bought a second pair as backup.
B00I3LI4E2|1|Not the right ones didn't even mention the make of my car in the packaging unfortunately I waited too long before installing them to return
B00BQYCKE8|5|These are very good towels really soak up the water or any liquid mess you spelled would recommend them and their quite a bit bigger
B0031B5IB6|4|Works fine, but rather expensive for a gasket.
B0031XULF2|3|Quality is very good including the lock, however I also had an issue of not getting it tie-up together, meaning the edges are not touching together to lock the wheel (rim) properly, it always have about 2 inch gap, which is not 100% accurate. Not sure whether it is a manufacturing defect.
B007QQRGM6|5|This assortment had all the sizes I needed to fix a ford F 250.
B00ANZHG4U|5|I was not too sure these would work well because of their price and was very surprised with the results. I use them to clean/detail vehicles and have not been let down so far. They wash well and are the same quality as the ones I get in a local store that I have to pay $8.99 for 5 cloths.<br /><br />If storing these in a garage make sure you store them in a ziplock bag or a bag you can twist-tie to keep dust from settling on them since these cloths pick up everything. Also if you are going to wash them in a washing machine like I do, do not use any kind of fabric softener with them. I like to use vinegar in place of fabric softener and have found that it will get the products I use on cars out of the cloths without messing up the microfibers. Over time I have found when buffing off wax  with microfiber cloths it can clog the microfibers over time even after washing. I will definitely be buying more of these in the future.
B007HG7YZ4|4|Used to upgrade a POL variable regulator. I had to drill out the center pin, it kept shutting off at higher flow rates.
B00PV9QKNQ|4|These are great rubber mats. I got them for my 2015 Honda Odyssey after researching rubber floor mats extensively, and these won because they were reasonably priced while being of good quality (according to other reviewers). They were very easy to cut to size. They are a little lighter than I imagined, but they stay in place fairly well. They are unfortunately a couple of inches narrower than the back floor area, which leaves room for dirt to get onto the carpet. The front is two pieces, which means that the area in front of the middle console is not covered- a big drawback, as I can see how easy it would be for drinks to be spilled onto the carpet right there. All in all, though, this set is a good buy.
B00MR6BNW4|5|Excellent item received in good order and on time.
B000C5BYDA|3|Not sure it's working correctly.
B00JT4HB14|5|Very good product!
B009S1DJQY|1|Failed within a couple weeks of usage.  It developed &#34;flicker.&#34;  It would be great if I was using it in an electric candle, but I am using it to provide light.  Oh well, It was worth a try.
B0037AC99A|5|Fast delivery! Right part !
B0058KKDD6|5|Perfect fit. Excellent.
B0010GBF70|5|Excellent Product, just as advertise
B00OYML4IM|5|Looks to be authentic, and I am generally able to tell. Looks exactly like the picture and came quickly and well packaged. Would recommend.
B0027XYKZO|4|Ill tell you in a 150,000 mile but they appear to be top quaility.
B00JJYPATO|1|Would be nice if you guys provided a template of how far away the buttons should be, so you can have a snug fit. Would be curious to know if you sell smaller rubber o rings ?
B004IARQXM|4|Great bushings! This kit does not work for 2006 double cab tundra cause they have 27mm sway bar. The end link bushing do work though. I wish they gave more lube with the kits.
B00NHMAJ40|3|Had problems with my first one and they sent me a second one. Works good but it needs heavy wire and also drains batteries pretty fast. Other than that a great light bar so far.
B0038LDSJI|4|98% FIT. Did not realize this was NOT A HONEY COMB GRILLE like the oettinger. otherwise a good product.
B00HEEXIKO|1|Buy original u be better of u taking 50/50 chance it might not work on bmw
B007SCOCW0|5|Good quaility!
B002BHX1X8|4|Works great.I was planning on getting  a basic cigarette plug memory savor with no OBD port at the end, then I remembered that the power is cut off to the cigarette lighter when the car is turned off. So I sprung for this gadget. This device is one of those oddball tools that you will only need once or twice in the life of your car when you need to change the battery. But when you need it. You NEED it. I had read stories of the memory getting corrupted or erased and having to go through a retraining period for the engine and transmission. This thing prevented that wasted calibration time.<br /><br />Pros: Works as described. Saved the memory on my 2009 GMC Acadia.<br /><br />Cons: Cable is too short to connect to another car to retain the memory. (Paper recommends to use a portable battery pack/jumper with a cigarette lighter plug)<br /><br />Overal a great product that saved calibration time. With the exception of the cord, I would recommend this product to friends and family.
B000HBNU9K|1|entire headliner fell apart in truck a month after installation when outside temperatures reached the mid 90's.  evidently heats makes the adhesive fail.  annoyed that i have to rip the headliner out and redo the entire job again.  next time i am using contact cement.
B00JY8RX6S|5|I purchased the Kabis Car Rimblades on August 19 and it was delivered on August 20.  Great delivery from Amazon.  I installed the Rimblades the evening of August 20.  I purchased this product for the Raceworz event held at Sacramento Raceway August 22.  This event was a combination of car show and drag racing for those who wanted to race.  When installing this product I followed the instructions to the letter with one exception.  I did the initial cleaning with lacquer thinner.  I then cleaned the wheels with the supplied alcohol followed by the supplied promoter.  The adhesive had exactly 34.5 hours to cure before hitting the road to the event.  The Sacramento Raceway is approximately 1.5 hours from my home.  80% of the driving was done on the freeway at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  I did have concerns that the Rimblades would detach on the freeway, but to my surprise, they held up with no issues.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I believe the key is proper cleaning and a minimum of 34 hours before driving.  Lastly the Rimblades look great.
B00BQHMJBO|5|Great product!  My 2014 Malibu was a pre certified car. The car is in great shape. No dents, but the rear bumper had bad scratches on it from luggage etc. The bumper protector covers all those scratches. Easy to install. Just make sure you center it well. Problem fixed.<br />Thanks!!!
B004GCRARY|1|Does not fit 2005 astro van. Had to grind and cut to make it work. About 90 percent correct, except where motor mounts to bracket. Not even close.
B010RIDERU|5|Unlike some of the other Hillary for Prison bumper stickers, this one is easy to read by other vehicles.  You don't want to be accidentally confused for a Hillary supporter, do you.
B000HZFDPK|5|great
B00802GIW4|5|Great hids for the price but some how my right one is kinda low I had them for a while now but I'll still buy them :)
B001FZJ5IM|5|Love it, just what I was looking for.
B011Q18D14|5|This product works great I'm so happy. Even if it's breaks now I would still buy it again just look at the price.
B000WNWKX0|5|These fit perfect in my ULTIMA 6spd and also HD 5spd.  Made in USA
B00VTELK9G|3|Said it was for a 2nd Gen... it's not it's for a 3rd. The holes on a 2nd are on the sides and these are front and back.
B0065LTR98|1|Save your cash!!! Small Garbage!
B000VU90GO|5|well built and looks great
B00KTIR1ZU|5|Go to ur dealer will program for free if your a reg. Works great
B008WB0626|5|Great item. Works perfectly
B00W8LQBK2|5|Great
B000C9NGN2|5|perfect for my 72 vette
B00PSPUKIO|5|Used by professionals.  Easy and good results
B0009OMYDS|5|works well, larger than what I need it for..
B00M909MD0|2|Look good but the halo rings are complete crap. Very dull headlights. Hard to see anything at night. Taillights are decent
B0036PUHN6|5|Love this winch. Easily mounted , heavy duty and easy to use.
B005BWI9SC|5|perfect fit
B00068GEJM|5|polish like a champ
B00B2YHFO2|4|Light is very bright and very little heat is released.  Delivery was on time.
B003O0YFYA|5|Good fit- seems to have OEM quality--time will tell--good price
B008C7CIBC|1|Very bad quality, at the first ride came off the key chain on the freeway.
B000CGB3Z8|5|Fast delivery and perfect fit.
B00FQKKNOW|5|Great company, solid product. Better steel than other brands. Had to take the whole lid off my Tacoma console to install, but very easy nonetheless.
B0026JCNJE|5|great product as it charges both my primary and secondary battery automatically plus the control units comes with the option of manual charging of both battery... also comes with battery voltage meter control... installation requires user knowledge in car electrical system.
B00HHIWTCU|5|I was so sick of not being able to clean the inside of the windshield, product works awesome!!!
B001NQF3YI|5|I purchased this to spot clean my new furniture, and it works wonderfully!  No water marks!
B00EE6VJ9M|5|Easy install. Everything works. Looks great
B00Q2AOINM|5|nice improvement
B000Q6QUV6|4|Very nice cloth holder for my lockout tools and pockets for air wedges and pry bars. The reason for the 4 stars is the top part of the case only has some Velcro and snaps to secure the opening. Would like to see a heavy duty zipper to enclose the top . Is too easy to lose the pry bars and air wedges out of the pockets
B004NEFQ9Y|5|The Police Thin Blue Line Metal Tag was made of a good metal material. It will be displayed proudly...
B004WA86VE|5|You cannot beat the price. Put on my 1998 softail  with Mikuni carb. I used longer 1/4-20x3/4 long screws with lock washer and 242 blue Loctite. I reused my spacer and not the one that came with it. I also rerouted my crankcase breathers into a Y and into a breather also bought from Amazon. Nothing is hitting the gas tank. I have floorboards and my leg seems to clear it fine. This thing looks like its going to stick you when you like at the right side of the bike. It go's along with the rest of spike's on the bike and I am happy with it.
B00ODIM3DW|5|What we needed.  Works perfectly.
B00C6MYIQM|5|Very good!
B000WJ9ALO|5|Sturdy and handy! This bag has great magnets. It stayed on in 40 mile an hour winds and 2200 miles. I did not secure using additional strap. Just the magnets. Easy on and off and no scuffing.
B005G21IQC|5|Exact replacement,installed in 5 minutes, works flawlessly
B00F8UN81A|5|Was a real hit!
B00BCR8SCW|3|It not fit very good on the driver side
B00KXNRC00|1|lights are too week
B000B8JUNY|5|When the check engine light for my 2004 Subaru Forester went on I decided to focus in on the fuel cap because the light would go on and off depending on how much I tightened the cap, usually lighting up after my car had sat outside all day.  I decided to buy a new fuel cap from the dealer for $25.00.  As a back-up I bought the Stant for $7.00 after reading the Amazon reviews in case the Subaru part didn't workout.  Looking at both fuel caps side by side I can't tell the difference except that the Subaru part attaches to the fuel door so you don't have to hold the cap or risk losing it.  The new fuel cap from the dealer didn't stop the check engine light from going on so I immediately switched to the Stant and the light went out (?).  Just amazing.  Not sure how this thing works so well, but $25.00 versus $7.00.
B00KTIZLZC|5|Amazing!!  This product was above and beyond my expectation.....
B00BV6UKV6|1|Not good.
B010SX2J3O|4|Had a Thule traditional &#34;two arm&#34; hitch rack and wanted a tray style rack to better fit my full suspension bike.  That said, saw heavy models, saw expensive models... figured I'd try this one out.<br /><br />Additional Features not mentioned in description:<br />&#62;&#62;Also compatible with 1 1/4&#34; hitches.  Metal Spacer attached to 1 1/4&#34; tongue to make it compatible to 2&#34;  This is fairly common, but I'll concede I bought thinking it was only 2&#34; ~I find the racks built solely for 2&#34; to be a little more stable.  That said, rack is more stable than I imagined.<br />&#62;&#62;When no bikes are on rack you can fold whole rack up for better clearance.  With the two bike model, I could still see using my back-up camera on my Honda CRV (Curt Hitch) when rack was folded.  This is done with a large plastic knob attached to a tether.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&#62;&#62;Lightweight - better for gas mileage<br />&#62;&#62;Price<br />&#62;&#62;Came more assembled in box than I expected.  Only needed to attached rack body to hitch tongue.  Then insert into hitch.  Tip: Whenever attaching racks like this put dabs of poly-lube on bolt threads or in the hitch to prevent rust et al from seizing it up.<br />&#62;&#62;Wheel tray design is nice and ratcheting buckles inspire confidence.<br />&#62;&#62;Padding on middle stabilizer is simple and effective.<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#62;&#62;Middle Stabilizer could be a little taller.<br />&#62;&#62;Ratcheting Buckle on middle stabilizer (like wheel trays) would inspire more confidence.  Also something more rigid than a fabric strap (albeit still with padding), would help ease bike attachment.  Sometimes holding bike, and securing strap is a three hand job.<br />&#62;&#62;Wheel straps may seem short if bike isn't positioned right.  (after adjusting wheel tray positions) on my longer travel bike with a longer wheel base it is within the limits, but I could see other bikes with fatter tires or an even longer wheelbase not working.<br />&#62;&#62;If two bikes are on, and similar size, you may get some interference with wider handle bars and saddles  requiring you to lower the saddles.  One more position for the wheel trays on the outside would maybe allow better asymmetry on the front and back bike, resulting in less interference.not working.<br />&#62;&#62;If two bikes are on, and similar size, you may get some interference with wider handle bars and saddles  requiring you to lower the saddles.

B006X8BFLQ|5|Looks great and easy to install!
B00JVWDWPS|2|Instructions suck! Shouldn't have to research every time online, nothing is labeled either
B004I0DCT4|1|It wasn't for my vehicle as advertised. I don't have a use for it
B004S4AFCM|5|Fast  shipping  and fit  good
B00TGODETA|4|Working great
B0012PDTS2|3|This items seal broke in transit cause oil to spread all over the entire box full of other parts.
B007QC2MSI|5|Connector used on 2007 Yukon and the like.  Bought to use with dorman efan conversion on my 1999 Tahoe using 34&#34; Evan assembly commonly found in 2007 Yukon.
B00D329DI2|4|So far seems to meet expectations.  Thought clear mats would be nicer with carpeting already in car.  Size worked out fine for my new Elantra.
B0038385H6|5|perfect
B004APM12G|3|It's convenient that it has both a pressure gauge and wear indicator all in one.  But the display isn't lighted, which could be hard to see at night.  I also discovered that I prefer to fill the tire's air with my right hand and use the gauge with the left, but I have to read the display upside-down.
B00G0LUXZK|5|this was the most smart move I have ever made when I bought this lock. it was way cheaper than any other one I was looking at. if anyone has Nissan Versa hatchback and you're having problems with your lock I recommend buying it this one. it's easy to put on and no hassle on it getting it quick from the seller.
B009O6Q898|4|Faded terribly after a few washes, was hung to dry never saw the inside of a dryer. Also expected it to be a bit thicker.
B008M1WB7E|4|As described and a perfect fit.  As a number of the other reviewers stated, it does cover your 2 built in floor bins, but I was easily able to access (while vehicle parked) by lift up from the edge that faces the front.<br /><br />Overall very pleased.  Does seem a little thin, but they say lifetime warranty so.. we will see.
B00X7UJYPM|5|Good kit
B008HZJWRW|1|Inner pads were manufactured with a different design shoe clip than the OE pads.  Although it is possible to modify the inner shoe clip to allow assembly, the clip does not align properly with the mating groove inside the piston.  This prevents the shoe from seating squarely on the piston surface.  As a result, the pads unevenly contact the rotor surface causing excessive drag and tapered/uneven pad wear.
B000I1CCBQ|3|Satisfied with product
B0002NIK3E|5|Nice tire cover. A little big for our spare tire, but allows you to tighten around it as much as needed to be secure.
B009D41M9C|5|EDELSIGN - HEXAGON Tire Rim Valve Stem Caps have a good chrome plating and have smooth well cut threads.
B00IDI7T0U|5|Perfect for my chrysler 300
B000FW2N08|4|Works great for very , very , minor leaks , but thicken 's up the hydroloic fluid
B002AQ51P6|5|Looks good, easy to install.
B0031BRN2I|5|Great Deal. Thank You. Love it!
B005S57UX2|5|Easy to install. Works great!
B00W2XEFU4|5|Great fit.
B00CAY9P9Q|4|Fits perfectly and works great.
B000GU3I6W|5|Good quality and great price.  I replaced the stock one on my XR650L with this XR400 version and it looks a lot cleaner.  It needed a couple of washers at the bolts to kick the back down to clear the frame on my 650, and I trimmed an inch or two off the back for better cooling air to the motor.  Looks great and very nice price.  Oh yea, the red color matches the red on my 650.
B004470FYQ|5|Fits perfectly on my KIA Sedona 2014.
B008GVBM70|3|Loved the light bar. I wish it lasted a little longer. It just now died on me. the plug doesn't last at all. If it was better made I would have gotten two of them.
B00G186POK|5|Very bright LED's. Such a BIG difference over the yellow OEM bulbs. I would go any brighter that these. Any more brightness and it would be uncomfortable inside the car. No regret here ! All worked fine.
B00KTHY6TU|5|Took 7 tries to program but works as described.
B00KYWO3MK|4|Came out very nice and looks great the only reason im not giving 5 stars is that it is not as dark as i had expected. I would recommend. My motorcycle only took 2 cans out of the 4
B00166VJYI|5|Easy to install and great fit
B001GAKS8W|5|Giga air freshener  smell great long lasting comes with 2 incerts
B003YMTJ6W|4|Let me say first that these seem to be of good quality and do fit my 06 f350 dually. the reason for only 4 stars though is that on amazon, it says that they are for the rear brakes. They are however the front rotors. I ended up having to go to a local parts store to get the correct part in the middle of my brake change. Thankfully I have another car for doing that.
B00COYZ9LU|1|Own a 2014 tundra crew max, purchased these. Barely got the first one on and see that the front of the tube pushes through the front mud flap, and nearly hits the tire. Considering Lund said this should fit perfectly, very unimpressed, plus they then charge me to return it. So thanks for sending me a part that doesn't fit and then charging me to send it back to you, I will not be purchasing any thing from Lund again given this extremely poor transaction and customer service
B0002KR88A|5|Heavy duty wiring and socket. Good value.
B00JIHC36K|2|Using these for the front side markers on my 2016 WRX.  They work great!  I've bought a lot of JDM ASTAR LEDs in the past couple months and haven't had a single issue so far.<br /><br />UPDATE (June 2016):  One of the lights flickers on and off completely (not a good thing when they're as bright are and other people are driving next to you), and the other light has one LED diode flickering.  I had to have a JDM ASTAR turn signal bulb from a different order replaced as well.  I'm really not too confident in these lights anymore.  From my experience, the company is very good about replacing defective items, but that doesn't do much good when they have problems less than a year later.
B002VI2YG2|5|I always trust this brand when it comes to brake pads. New clips and tension springs are a plus as well. The quality of the WTQ is hard to beat. This is my opinion but I've done a lot of brake work and have had great success with this brand.
B0010DXYHW|5|The filter was an exact match to the filter on the car.
B006X8CQYG|5|Fit good on 2010 Mazda b2300
B000SKV4U2|5|Quick delivery, great product at a great price. What more could I ask for?
B000BHKZIE|4|Worth buying for the price
B008UR7J6I|2|only usable as a scanner and it does not connect to all devices.  highly recommend getting a different one.
B00PJ1XGY2|5|My favorite sticker!
B010QW34M2|5|Despite the hiccups in the delivery over all the product was awesome...
B004SF0ZLC|5|work fine. love your prices.
B00KMYYQ5O|4|Great product, a bit difficult to transfer to a smaller spray bottle as it foams up when poured (so you might be better off just ordering in smaller spray bottle size)
B00I4CLY6A|4|Solid squeegee for the price. No complaints here.
B000COC67E|5|good buy, rolls good,comfortable
B000C1PFXO|5|Fast shipping, great product.

B000BZI4JS|5|Perfect
B00GUJHIZU|5|The description says they won't fit the Chevy Equinox 2010 but they fit mine perfectly.  Along with the fog lamps it's a perfect enhancement to your vehicle.

B000C7Y7VE|5|Worked great so far no issues
B004RCR190|5|Expensive but works
B00FMV0WFA|5|Perfect fit.
B000H3Q2FC|2|I should have listened to other reviewers who said the two sizes of screws didn't work with their glasses. They didn't work with mine, either, so this kit did me no good at all. Newer eyeglasses use smaller screws than the ones provided here.
B00N2HFX9Q|5|A+
B010PFSIN0|5|Really great light at a fantastic price!  Would buy from again in a second...
B001UEHMCO|1|Lasted a couple of days before the cover broke off sitting at idle on a stop light I heard something rattling came home popped the hood and the noise was coming under the fuses and relay box took the cover off the fuse and relay box to find out it was the brand new relay I just installed had to super glue it back on I recommend the Denso 567-0001 Relay looks more like the factory relay and better quality built check it out before you buy this one the denos relay is not glued on like this one it is clipped on like the factory relay to prevent the cover from breaking off like mines I will be returning this beck arnley relay for the denso relay.
B000C9S4RU|5|Worked great. Very reasonable price.
B002KIHHNI|5|Looks exactly like the OEM Harley part. This fits perfectly and is easy to install.<br /><br />Well worth it.
B000Q754E4|5|After owning 2 Coleman full sized 12v coolers in the past, I figured I'd try this unit to see if the space was more useable. The Colemans always treated me well but I found that depending on what and how you put stuff in them, it would be difficult to find room to stack things on top without crushing them. This Koolatron just returned from a 3 week road trip across the country with my two kids and was used the entire time, both in the suv and hotel rooms. It's quiet, so quiet that I often had to look at the fan to make sure it was actually on. It truly keeps  the contents around 40 degrees below outside air temp (tested it with a thermometer). The best part, and the reason I wont go back to the colemans, is the extra height. You can load it up with bottled water, beer bottles, milk etc. and still have more than enough room to lay the included plastic tray on top to hold lunch meat, eggs or whatever, without being crushed by the lid. Excellent design! WARNING though... do NOT buy the Koolatron 120v to 12v adapter. Luckily I bought the whole set up a week before our trip and test ran it one evening. The adapter was squealing and very hot to the touch. I ended up buying a bulkier and oversized converter which worked very well.
B00IKZTRLA|5|Very well made, some people have even thought my truck is an actual zombie edition
B0064COR34|5|is an ignition coil - does what ignition coils do.  if you are considering buying this part, i assume you know how to install it.  if installed correctly, works correctly.
B003BM5LUI|5|This thing is great, a must-have for small motor boats that like to nose up to the beach. helps in areas with big tide exchange so your boat stays safely off the beach
B00OA66IG0|5|Creates insane foam. Not only does it work good but it is a blast
B000CFO0GI|5|Very good
B003RVUO1O|5|Works Perfectly!
B0076AUCX2|1|Pos did not fit after I gave model and spec would not recommend this to anyone
B001O15D7E|5|Used on a 1998 Lexus ES300 to replace the original hood lifts. Very easy to install; both sides took 15 minutes and it works well. Comes with all the parts you need. (Install tools sold separately but if you are going to do the install yourself you probably have the tools already!)
B00DES62UC|4|Gloves are super comfortable and don't require much breaking in. A tiny bit of the stitching is coming undone on the left glove between the thumb and forefinger and I've only ridden with them twice though, so that's something to be careful for.<br /><br />I like the hardknuckle construction, and there's padding underneath it to keep the comfort reasonably high.<br /><br />The perforated leather on top of each finger offers ample venting even at low speeds.<br /><br />No snot patch or faceshield squeedgie, which I would like to have on my gloves.<br /><br />Reasonably good gloves for the price, but if you have a higher budget I'd look into something else.
B009LNG85S|4|it fit good. and I like the product.
B00TUNSOMO|5|I have used 303 automotive products on my automobiles, before, and have had great results. Though this product is more expensive than many other brands, I can't say anything negative about the results.<br /><br />The last time I took my boat out of the water, I used this to clean it up and it really left the boat gleaming and smooth. It DOES clean, as well as shine up the boat, though, so you can use it to get rid of water spots. It uses carnauba wax, which everyone knows is great for aquatic sports accessories.<br /><br />The label says the waxing should offer protection for 30 days, though it seems like the time frame would be longer if I don't take the boat out much. I don't know, yet, as I haven't been using it much, yet. If I have more to say on the product I'll revise the review at a later date.
B000IHK1VI|5|This tool is awesome.  Perfect for refilling the cooling system after a water pump, hose, or thermostate change, or for flushing your coolant system.  You attach it to a strong compressor (really need about 120# of pressure for this tool to create the proper vacuum level), place it in your overflow reservoir and create a vacuum on the cooling system.  You then turn on the intake valve and refill your entire cooling system in minutes from a bucket of pre-mix with absolutely no air in the system.  Not only a time saver, but a must when working with modern engines where trapped air in the system will cause overheating and damage the engine.  This company makes two versions of this tool...this model which is made of plastic and a professional model made of brass.  If I were using it on a daily basis, I would probably go with the more expensive brass model, but both work the same, and this lower priced plastic model is perfect for home mechanics who will only use it occasionally.
B004VR08IW|5|Great product. It nice and wide to step in with my size 12 shoes. I think it also deflects some not all snow and road debrie from my doors ( I do also have the factory mud flaps). The only thing I didn't like about the install is the metal on metal contact from the bracket to my cab.  I have strips of rubber from work that I put in between to act as a gasket. Also the other thing I wasn't to crazy about is the unpainted bolts and clips to fasten the painted brackets to the cab.  I live in southeast PA where love to to use a lot salt in the winter time so I will have to replace those bolts before the rot away.<br />All in all I think it is a great product even if I have to buy some stainless bolts
B006LJ1XXC|5|I love them!
B00C7I4PL8|5|Bought to take in the RV specifically for use as clothespins and I love the fact they can be threaded directly onto the line and I never lose one.  Good strong clip!
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Great idea that I've been waiting for a long time. Was it created by a woman? It's strong. It's convenient. It's out of the way and it holds a lot.
B0002SPCBW|5|Excellent product.
B006TMKWBA|5|i was very pleased with the item . I bought the passenger side last year from auto zone and it cost three times what i now paid on Amazon. The parts came  not damage and it was easy to install even had the light bulb already in. Very happy fits  perfectly and it works.
B00DJ14SFU|5|perfect replacement for my Honda
B004GBJAOG|4|its ok
B00YT1IAN0|5|first
B000CMHVGC|5|Worked perfectly when I rented a camping trailer, and I can still hook up my utility trailer. Good product, worth the price. Saves the aggravation of re-wiring my trailer twice.
B000CQSKWM|5|Very sturdy. Would strongly recommend
B00SIPOSQG|5|It lights up the world. Buy this product. After sending back other brands due to water intrusion. This gas been under water. Slammed through the swamps and it just keeps on going.
B000ST5AY4|4|good quality...a little difficult yo get on over the windshield
B000C91EBI|5|Pipes should come with replacement bolts
B00WUG1A9C|5|I was affraid that will not be as bright as a new brights ,but they are a lot better.i just bought 2 more kits, one bulb had one side out and they sent me a whole new kit best seller and plus he bulbs last a lot longer then new brights
B00B2B4D4A|5|Lift kit very well constructed  Instalation instructions good. Service was excellent
B00NM6N2WM|5|Great
B00GI77OVW|5|Makes a big difference when compared to standard bulbs.My vision is dramatically improved b/c of<br />these bulbs.
B00MN92QI0|5|Very nice
B00CS7T0IQ|4|The description on this item needs to include the statement that it will not fit the Polaris Ranger 900 XP.  We have the Ranger 900XP Hunter Edition and the mounting on these mirrors will not wrap around the roof supports.  My husband is a mechanic, therefore, with a lot of perseverance and ingenuity, he was able to mount the mirrors to the actual body.  This gives us a full view of the sides and rear as well as the panoramic mirror inside the cab.  The quality of these mirrors is very good with little to no distortion in the view, as with the panoramic mirrors.  Thought about returning them, but there is nothing on the market for the Ranger 900 XP, so this is the next best thing.
B009SEX2XG|5|My friend had some of these in her daughters room && I fell absolutely in love with them. I didn't notice them until she turned the light off. They are super cute sooo I had to get some for myself!
B000FW2MBS|3|smaller than I thought. works ok.
B0039Z3SRA|5|fun
B0002STTSY|1|Does not crimp blue size connectors
B009Q6M1JW|5|great.
B00915JI08|5|Just as described
B000S2SSYK|5|Always best to go with OEM, great product
B00KMBEMZG|1|This is only a cover, not the actual keyless entry, ripoff!
B00AF5YM90|5|perfect
B002N5J8CQ|3|Should have purchased 45 degree flush!
B000C11JMA|5|Great fit. Just like the original.

B007UHPREU|5|great
B00BXLV964|5|This job took over 2 hours but is fixed the problem
B000C5I92Y|5|Great item and easy install if you know what you are doing.
B000EQCUBW|3|One of the strut was defective.  Love amazon return policy.
B00AC6XRDE|4|4 1/2 stars<br />Update:<br />  after approx. 30 hrs of riding with the bags draped directly on and &#34;touching&#34; the rear fender paint...<br />  they are scratching the paint's clear coat.<br />  I thought this was a possibility and took a chance. The scratches can be buffed out. Just thought I'd share that info here.<br />  I will try putting a micro clothe material as a buffer.<br /><br />Finally, large carry bags. I thinking I could stuff 8  2-liter bottles in each bag. I sort of tried it but didn't have 8 bottles total.<br />Made from Top Quality material ( i don't think its water proof, not sure)<br />Side zipper pockets have a a fabric partition wall inside.<br />The bags come shipped compressed flat and you have to insert 2 stiff but flexible vinyl covered pieces inside to created the form of each bag.<br />The bottom ones insert with some effort - under a fabric loop and into receiving pockets at the bottom corners.<br />However, the other bag forming insert takes 2 men and a boy (as the old expression goes) to insert it properly in each bag.<br />Its an inverted &#34;U&#34;as the illustration shows but it is soo tight and difficult to force into place...<br />How difficult? Well, Nelson-Rigs gets a lot of calls from customers who say that piece is 6 or 8 inches too long to fit... :-)<br /><br />The water proof rain covers are almost as hard to put on. (but any looser and they might come off while riding)<br />There are 2 quality shoulder straps included. They have plastic male end buckles that latch into 2 in-board fasteners to facilitate carrying the bags.<br /><br />The wide in-board velcro straps, up top and joining the two bags, keep the rain covers from stretching down along the inside of the bags.<br /><br />I worry that the main zippers might not last for years and years of use. Only time will tell.<br />My photo shows the bags over large mounting studs (protruding 1 1/4&#34; and not visible) still there from previous bags.
B008MISCLQ|5|The best motorcycle oil you can get for your bike. You get imediate smoother shifting , even if shifting is already smooth. Better fuel mileage
B0018E4SEG|5|Quality product. Will be very easy to clean.
B00SIX11VS|1|The star is for item works as described, problems plastic around the edges is thin and most of the screw holes had only thin sections that barely held the screws this area water will get in.  Item is not watertight in general, I would not recommend buying this item.
B00CNKQS7E|5|A gift to my friend who was a huge fans of Hello Kitty since she was a kid.<br />She loved it when I gave this to her, having good experience with the seller
B00L849030|5|good price and quick shipping for a not prime item
B002X9WNJC|5|I ordered five but thinking about getting more! They're very nice and the size was just perfect for me. Very easy to apply and it looks very nice! Thanks
B000F5HV0W|4|Muy bueno
B00480GYZI|4|Make no mistake - these do not emit a bright white light.  I would say that a bright yellow would be more accurate, but it is still lighter in color than what you would find with your stock bulbs.  As much as I like the cleanliness of a 6000K LED, the color temperature given by the Crystal Vision Ultras does in fact light your path with noticeably more usable light. Being that I just installed these bulbs - I can't comment on it's longevity, but assuming that they last almost as long as the stock bulbs, I would say that they're worth the twenty bucks that I spent on them.
B006C52VZ4|5|Ordered this and got a greddy BPV idk if that's what is supposed to be in there but okay. It works well. Flutters or just blows off really well.
B0050SL1SW|1|Be Warned, this is NOT a $52 MUFFLER. It is a Cheap, $18 Glasspack.<br /><br />Glasspacks are Flow-through, and NOT STREET LEGAL ! ! !<br />They do NOT muffle the Sound, in ANY WAY.<br /><br />Do not waste your Money, on False Advertised Products, such as this Patriot Exhaust &#34;MUFFLER&#34; wannabe...
B002BVXM92|1|Did not work for me. Toyota Camry 2003. I followed the instructions. The engine check light still remains.
B000C9GNLE|5|Easy to install fixed my issue
B00L3OJW4C|5|Works great and convenient. Used on my 06' R1200gs and made a hassle-free instillation for 2 sets of auxiliary lights, battery maintainer, and aux accessories power supplies.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Very nice and worth the money
B004Z75I24|5|This is the cheapest replacement for Audi/VW power steering fluid out there, and it does it's job just fine at half the price. If you're an Audi/VW person (or other euro-car which requires mineral oil power steering fluid), I would recommend stocking up on this stuff. It's always good to have around, and it beats paying ~$25 per liter at the dealership.<br />One thing to note, this bottle will leak once opened if tipped over even when the cap is fastened - not a huge amount, but it's enough to make the surrounding area oily.
B004AE0EBC|5|😊
B000BRFWWI|5|Very good quality
B000C9CCJ6|5|I have an older GMC truck that I have refurbished. I needed the AC/Heat control panel knob. If anyone is looking and in need of panel knobs, this was an Exact Fit! Great job ACDelco!
B0055FE1QY|5|This is a perfect trash bag! I have it over the gear shift and it fits nicely and doesn't get in the way. I would recommend this bag and it would be perfect for gifts.
B00FRHOGU6|5|My windshield is like nigh and day with these babies. Easy to install. Never buying another brand.
B0009IQXAE|5|I love this stuff. Over the years I have graduated from the heavy waxes to the spray waxes and the detailers. My view is less is more on new or like new finishes. Most spray waxes always leave streaks. If I detail the car indoors in a climate controlled environment and then pull it outdoors, the streaks appear if the ambient is humid or chilly and damp. You just can't win. With Quick Detailer my car looks perfect and no streaks. On a new car I will use Optima paint sealer and then Quick Detailer after washes. Love the scent and the slick feel. I can jam all the doors and the trunk with the treated microfiber towel after doing the car. Then I wipe off my iphones, glasses, laptops, monitors and anything that could use a mirror finish. I will use my older microfiber towels and Quick Detailer to clean and highlight the rims. They are machined and painted. Like to get in and wipe the inner part of the rims so the whole wheel looks detailed. Pretty much sold on this stuff as it is easy to use. You can take your time or do a 5 minute wipe down. Either way the results are fantastic. The reflections are so dramatic I was picking up defects in the shop floor and thought they were on my finish. Also bird droppings! It happens. Just spray and soak with Quick Detailer. The waste disintegrates and floats off the paint. Then just wipe off lightly with a microfiber towel. Nothing this stuff can't do.
B000CIV716|5|Great quality. Never have any problems removing or installing, never any drainback problems with a horizontal installation [can't say the same for Fram filters ...]<br /><br />Happy to use them on extended drain intervals of 7,500 miles and greater.<br /><br />Watch for the infrequent sale prices. Sometimes in the $8 range, or two for $17, including Prime shipping.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Installed it on my 4 wheeler and for as cheap as it was I am very pleased with how bright it is.
B006YBAMWA|4|Great. Different from other rubber floor mats. Good fit and completely cover front and back floor areas. A bit finicky to fit but they settle in nicely in my Q5
B000C5I6FE|2|It didn't work in either of my GM vehicles. Just blew the fuses out. Might work OK for other vehicles, but not either of mine. Sent it back for a refund, no problems with Amazon at all.
B00279PI9K|1|Nothing wrong with part I suppose other than it didn't fit my rear caliper as the amazon computer guru said it would for my 06 mountaineer.<br />pulled the other one and went to Napa and matched it up. Sits on a shelf now can't even use the rubber cap.
B00PWQ2B6S|5|Awesome!
B007NA9CAE|4|Great price and a great step (actually bought 1 pair and this single step)<br />Easy to install on the 97-03 F150 and no adapter brackets needed. I used the enclosed reinforcement brackets and they are stout. My fat neighbor couldn't get them to budge with his 300+ pounds. My truck is a 3-door so I bought 3 steps. Makes sense, right?
B00DOI8A8E|5|Real nice
B001A1MA42|5|very accurate...was a pleasure purchasing from you.
B009M0S4ZM|3|Easy to install and remove, sturdy construction. The only criticism I have is that the cover is too short. Even tightly pulled down over the backrest, it only overlaps the front seat edge by maybe 2 inches. So if you have a fidgety dog, he will pull the cover back, exposing the seat. Also if the back of you lower pants are dirty, that will transfer to the front of the seat edge, because it won't be covered.
B0096J90KW|5|Works great in our rv.
B003VAUMX6|5|I'm using this to mate a 5/16 inch ID tube with a 1/2 inch ID tube, which has a water pump attached.  I pump water through a radiator, and I don't even need any tube clamps.  The barbs are enough to keep everything perfectly sealed.<br />I'm glad I purchased this.
B00UPWC5EM|3|A little bulky but ok. Love the color
B009RU9LWC|1|Low beam burned out exactly 14 months after installation.  I noticed the bulb now shows out of stock on Amazon--I think that's probably a good thing.
B0006IX87S|5|Works as advertised.
B0038N1VD6|5|Fit my 2003 Miata SE just fine. It works great.
B00H36XX6C|5|First off, this isn't cheap. It's heavy duty and well made. You can charge your cellphone off this. The light is really bright. This is small enough you can put it in your pocket or on your belt. The light has four settings. The body is rubberized which is cool. The light lens is recessed to keep if from being scratched or damaged, even if dropped. (Will get back to everyone on if you can submerge this or just get it wet with a spilled cup of water.)<br /><br />I did see some reviewers gave this less than 3 stars. If you read pg 1 of the manual it states: Pass through technology...which allows you to recharge the battery pack and your device at the same time. (This I will test with our different devices as we have many types to see what does and doesn't charge to full capacity.)<br /><br />My husband couldn't say enough about this gadget and he is a gadget, flashlight, radio, solar nut so if he loves it, I know this is a top notch product. The only other product I've seen him get this excited about is GoalZero. By the way, this seems better than the one hubby has from GoalZero.<br /><br />It's is a very sturdy item and one that will hold up well in any situation from what I can tell. Will do an update in a few weeks.
B00873J0YY|5|prompt service ,easy to assemble , and works great
B00GHT6SF4|5|Fit real nice.Fast service too!
B00KIFL6N2|5|Good Quality Frame
B00J54N7MK|5|AMAZING!!! if you have a auto painting project these guys are thee only ones you should trust. I've will only buy from them for any automotive paint job ever.... thank you so much.
B00XZ9ONA6|5|this is the 2nd one i bought and works perfect and took me seconds to reprogram
B00DGCP0OK|4|I ordered the Delkevic pipes for the value and good ratings it had. My fz6 sounds as good as any super sport on the road. They were somewhat easy to install. Delkevic does have instructions online to help with the fz6 since there is a little more involved with the undertail mounting. The quality and sound are good compared to other higher costing pipes out there which made the Delkevic a no brainer.
B005H13SKQ|5|So easy to install.  Found a u-tube video that made the installation a breeze.
B00HR26X6O|5|I put these is my 2007 GMC Yukon and they fit perfect. Blue in color and much brighter that stock lights.
B00T7DR7FW|5|Good. As described.
B00UZYINGE|3|This was supposed to be a direct fit for a 2004 BMW X3 but in reality, the plastic frame was about 1/4&#34; bigger than the one I was replacing and I had to trim some plastic off the edges before it would fit in the filter box on the car. It was very easy to do with a sharp knife as I just sliced off two of the plastic fins sticking out that didn't seem to serve any purpose but I shouldn't have to do that for a direct replacement.
B00E63TI32|5|I love it!!  I use it as a growler.  It keeps my beer cold and carbonated on picnics.
B004LF13GA|5|Unit was purchased and installed in a 2001 Coleman Utah. The unit arrived promptly and was as advertised. Installation was straight forward. The opening was tight and required a little word with a wood rasp. The wiring was spliced into the pig tail cut from defective unit. The battery circuit is well marked and the 12 volt circuits are user preference. Camper now has a 30 amp main breaker (not included) and a warning buzzer if one of the 12 volt fuses is blown. Definitely an upgrade from the centurion.
B000EQ97VS|5|Good price, easy to install it myself, works great!
B00DJSRSSM|5|High quality and looks great - Just wish it actually fit my 2015 R60 MINI Countryman S.
B000IY9HW0|5|centric is always top notch
B00F8NVQ7K|4|The lights themselves are great. Very bright, lots of flash patterns, and they seem to be very well made. Now for the downsides:  First, the power supply cord is on the passenger side light. This seems backwards to me. Second, there's a giant plug on the wire that hooks the two lights together. It's tough to tuck into the headliner. Having the plug on one side or the other would be a better design. Third, the mounting brackets. Oh, those mounting brackets! They don't work at all on my '14 Sierra. I had to fabricate my own.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good, bright light. It could use some minor alterations, but I'd still buy again. Set aside at least a half day for installation.
B00306YG3S|5|Great gloves , especially when being used with solvents.
B0010E00T6|5|Helped my air conditioning work much more efficiently replacing the original cabin air filter with this one.
B0080HJL7S|5|DISCLAIMER: I received a product discount for this review.<br /><br />Sometimes it feels like I live in my car, and the trash just builds up. I try to keep plastic bags handy, but soon they become trash themselves. When I saw the Best Car garbage Bag for Trash and Litter, I knew I had to try it. Let me just say, I think it's perfect. It's handy, the size is great, and it makes it easier to keep my car clean.
B009D2R5YU|5|IT worked fine for my Sym Symba scooter.
B001KSEHBE|5|Very good service and product
B00KTJ0EA8|1|Don't purchase, as the info is very misleading.  I bought them and went to my dealership and they couldn't program them.
B00SQ1K19A|5|Vent pipes were 1-1/4&#34; rather than 1-1/2&#34;. I used two 1-1/2&#34; couplings and ground down the 1-1/2&#34; pipe inside the couplings to fit the 1-1/4&#34; vent pipes. Looks and works like gangbusters.
B00N5C28BO|5|This works really well,I will be ordering another soon.
B00LLNWT36|1|cheap cheap cheap -
B000CNNTW6|1|The microfiber cloth is okay but the description is unclear on how many you receive. It indicated there are a dozen when you actually receive one. I questioned the seller about this and this is the reply I received, &#34;The description was letting customers know to look for the 12pk if you liked this towel. If this listing was a 12pk it would have been stated in the title and in the bullet point and would reflect in the weight listed. Plus a 12pk of these quality towels would also be far more expensive. I hope this helps to clarify.&#34; I did look before I bought and could not find a 12pk!
B005F3HZ5A|5|Super quality product, the best I have ever used.
B004KED6XA|5|A relative of mine had been sent on a snipe hunt for years for a &#34;pipe spreader&#34; at his workplace. Who's laughing now?
B0012H6HMK|4|Cute, works well. I got two sets for my pop-up camper. No complaints except that it warns you of trace amounts of lead in either the weld or paint, so just don't touch them a lot...
B00JVHLS3G|5|Worked perfectly!
B007SM2ER0|4|Good
B00EI6CKVE|5|Cute.
B006VTXTV6|5|great product
B0076ATZT4|4|Installed easily and functions well.  Great replacement for a missing antenna.
B00CNUUU5A|5|This is a great hitch for your tractor!  Fits my John Deer 3pt hitch perfectly.<br /><br />I ALMOST DIDN'T buy thus because 1 review mentioned the lower steel is angle iron not square tube like the receiver.<br /><br />Who Cares?!!!  It's category rated and plenty solid.  I have a 2000 lb trailer with a 400+ tongue weight and this works perfectly!<br /><br />I shopped several similar rigs t b at were over $200!  Because it's listed as a Kubota I worried somehow it wouldn't fit my JD.<br /><br />It's a standard configuration 3 point hitch that'll fit any standard 3ph.
B0018ICAMO|5|I am very pleased with the product. It fit my 1993 ARE camper just like the original SUSPA'S did. They we're as described measurements were spot on and they arrived on time and very well packaged. And they are made in the USA.
B00B9DE8HS|5|MADE my FIBERGLSSS BOAT SHINE
B0035QVZRS|5|This shield fits the windshield of my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 very well.  It is still a bit bulky when rolled up, but for the fit and quality I will live with that.  My truck is a regular cab, so I don't have a back seat to fold it in half and toss it on like other reviewers.  I don't use it daily at every stop, but my truck sits for days or weeks at a time and I like having the dashboard and interior protected.
B001AM8CRU|5|Made my truck ride like new. Thanks Rich
B00N3VYMJ8|5|I am a ups driver and this has absolutely saved my wrists.  Thank you
B004XE8R18|3|Haven't had the opportunity to used it just yet. Good thing I guess but its veri nicely designed kool and sleek ..
B00413IG9Y|5|direct bolt on for my 2015 silverado, no drilling & no fitment issues
B00HFAHYDY|5|Great sticker, easy instructions, stays on the window even with heavy rain/ pressure washing.
B0040JYPFS|1|These after market lights triggered the check engine light on my Tacoma. I can't use them.
B005FYJ5B6|5|I replaced the stock battery that came with my 2011 F150 SCREW XLT Ecoboost. This thing lasts FOREVER using my 1200 watt peak inverter, even when the truck is off. The truck starts easier and everything seems to have more juice then it used to. I am planning on adding a sound system and a JL stealthbox for the rear seats. This Battery is just a hair smaller than the stock, so I had to use the padding on the original battery to squeeze it into the locking bracket. Buy a large and small post if you have a 2011 F150.
B00BD4SJBO|5|These seat covers are working great for me. Thank you!
B000C5FL16|5|This is what the dealer would have put in.  I put it in myself and saved on the labor charge. It was very easy as it just slides in.
B00651C2E0|1|No AM reception
B003YEZ05O|5|great quality, don't forget to order the feeler gauge blades.
B000E4JKK8|5|Worked great... perfect fit
B005JMD07Y|4|Like it good for the price but took time figure how to put those on bike but still good
B002SSKFIY|5|WOW!!!! Works amazing and fast!!! Will purchase again.
B00FJ01N6G|1|Wrong part received. If you have a B5 Passat better order from ECS Tuning. They show the correct year range for two different styles of this part that fit the B5.
B00W6IZRR0|5|Great job.
B00JBNYYQ8|2|Didn't really do what it said it would do
B000E28M54|5|A1
B000ELVJT6|1|Did not fit 2000 Chevy cavalier.
B0007X7NZA|1|These were the biggest pain to install, and didn't want to stay adhered to the headlights.
B004SCTWTQ|4|They work great but the driver's side unit isn't exactly correct.  The original part from Lexus has a bracket welded on the housing that holds a bunch of electrical wires.  I had to do away with the bracket and let the wires dangle.  It's not perfect, but it works.
B0085Y7600|5|Nice. Made of plastic but looks just like a car badge. Very large. Would be awesome to have one in a scale that matches actual car badges.
B00TPXG0NO|1|Neat idea but poor execution. Attempted install on 2015 Tacoma, using the supplied &#34;adapter&#34;. The adapter is nothing more than a wide ring to prevent the lock from being slid inboard, and in my case it was too large for my application. I had to grind down the side nearest the tailgate skin as the clearances were tight.<br /><br />Upon test-fitting, I noticed the shiny adapter and shiny lock were visible below the bottom edge of the tailgate, making it very obvious that something was there. Took everything off, painted the adapter and the metal band of the lock, and reinstalled.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this 'universal' kit again. If they make an application-specific model for the Tacoma I might consider it, but the fit on the universal version is too sloppy and not usable out of the box.
B0009IBJE4|4|arrived on time, meets my requirements...
B00C7M3CYA|5|AMAZING
B00C7Y1XB2|5|Was 40$ at auto parts store and this was a fraction of the price. Was a VERY easy installation and the new handle fit great.
B00CJO45IS|5|Bed shirt ever
B00LM54Z4O|5|This is my favorite scent and I can never find it at the stores and now I got a whole bulk of them! This is definitely worth it.
B00JBIB7OK|4|Awesome lights very attractive and noticeable at night. I also agree with the first reviewer about the glue being more accurate.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this product to anyone interested in it.
B002LGZRCW|5|Awesome hubcaps fit my 97 Camry perfectly. These are better than the ones I had and they wrap around the wheel really tight.
B00JSYOU0K|5|This bracket was really more sturdy than I thought it would be.  Figured for flimsy aluminum but turns out to be both heavy and sturdy.  Good stuff.
B004TTS640|5|My Husband Was Extremely Happy with this Purchase for his Truck!!
B00K7938LW|3|Didn't fit my car, but they are cute.
B00CA963AA|5|great easy
B00Q030QZA|5|Everything came quickly and exactly what I wanted!
B00SRL80TC|5|Perfect fit! This was a direct  replacement for the OEM one. Same part number, same manufacture everything... Great buy.
B000AOMQ80|5|Worked great and a lot less expensive than a new inner tube.
B00SLKJKMA|5|looks great!
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Product is very good and very thick nice material amd covers well,only thing I had to return is because it was little bigger for my front glass and so it was not holding perfectly and kept falling down and I would have have them 5 star if they would have sent me suction caps with this product,then I might have not returned this product as I got already another product with 6 pieces with suction caps that too for lesser price but still this product quality is so good compare to what I have got aftrr returning this..so If you have suction cap or willing to spend for it then nothing wrong with this product...I would have given 5 star if product comes with suction caps..but for me it was little big so I decided to return it.but It covers and keep your deskbord almost 80% cooler den wothout it...so worth to buy for sure
B0030DIURE|3|Need to have instructions for product purchased
B000FPXUHK|4|Is like the original part. Honesty , I bought this for my stock.I don't have tried it ,  even.
B011B25IXY|5|I would describe the size as a 'Large'. It holds quite a bit of water. I use this for my two bucket car wash with my home depot buckets and grit guards.  I would highly recommend it.
B0013IR88A|5|Awesome does exactly what it should I can run this off my solar powered battery in the motorhome
B0072GV5E0|1|it sticks well and fits, but the leak was even worse than before when i had a 25 year old seal on! did not keep water out whatsoever. i would recommend getting weatherproofing from home depot for $6 before using this
B004UPZVSC|4|This is really a neat product. With so many different thing to power/charge now days this provides many options. It is light in the sockets so you can easily find it in the dark. It fits in the cup holder nicely and does not move around. Good product for the price.
B005D1EZM0|5|looks good on my frontdoor
B000BGK2L0|5|simple...keeps the drain valves on my 2002 Forest River moving..being permanently sited in an RV park is doesn't get the advantage of getting 'sloshed' by driving on the roads and it needs help.  This product works!
B00ML7DIJA|5|Amazingly bright. Used these as back up lights and wow. They are at least 10x brighter than stock and the light pattern is not only straight back but off to the side as well. Very helpful to see people that might be walking by. Also the color is a very bright white most likely 6k. I would highly recommend to anyone and I will be purchasing again.<br /><br />P.S. my dad was following me to the store around noon one day and he said when I went to put the truck in park the lights almost blinded him. In the middle of day mind you. It shows the true awesomeness.
B00BR4RZXI|5|Nice size, went on easily
B00JDW6IZ2|4|Worked perfectly .
B000C55YU4|5|thanks saved money and time
B00SX9RFJO|4|The Correct Radiator.  Running well in my car.
B0001DRHFM|5|Very pleased. These should last me a very long time. I am 5 ft. 10 inches tall 185 Ibs. The medium fit perfect.
B0049DY5MS|5|If you have a 2000 Ford Focus ZX3, this will work for the Driver side door. Don't pay any attention to Amazon telling you that it wont fit because it DOES.(Zx3 has the longer door)
B00TRNISGE|4|Overall construction is good. However, the threads on the male end were of the trapezoidal type and would not fit in the O2 bung. Luckily, I have an 18x1.5 triangular cut die and I was able to make it work. For this, one star removed.
B0052FRX9E|4|Fit fine.  Hope it lasts.
B00IEH2TN2|5|I think this lights are really nice and a very good price
B00C5RBRA8|5|Our first sewer hose for our new motorhome. Secures well and rinses easily. has any &#34;normal&#34; end you might need included. Positive locking makes a dirty job MUCH safer!
B00Y4NQJ86|1|This item came in damaged very upset
B00R7ORS34|4|I purchased this wrench, as well as another from Pit Posse when it was time to do the rear wheel on my 2010 ultra Limited Harley Davidson. The rear wheel has a removable axle nut on one side, and a welded nut attached to the other side of the axle, both the same size. This wrench is shorter than the Pit Posse offering. Both wrenches come with a square hole so you can attach it to your torque wrench and torque the axle to specs. This wrench actually worked better for that use in my opinion. The shorter length allowed me to maneuver the wrench around to the best position, and the fact that it is a 12 point design versus the 6 point design of the Pit Posse helped in this regard as well. The outer diameter of the big end of the wrench also fit better on the removable nut, being slighter smaller than the Pit Posse. The slightly smaller OD does not weaken the wrench to the point it fails, and the wrench is thicker anyways, so, still plenty of meat there to do the job. The 12 points, while not gripping a nut as well as a 6 pointer, did not slip nor round off the nut. I mentioned the square holes in both wrenches. This OTC branded wrench has a 1/2&#34; drive hole, while the Pit Posse has a 3/8ths hole. Remember, if attaching to your torque wrench, this wrench MUST be turned 90 degrees from the direction of your torque wrench. Positioning it this way means it does not alter the length of your torque wrench and screw up your torque. The wrench is finished in a pretty durable black finish, branded with the 4882 part number, and the word Taiwan. No size indicator on this wrench. The Pit Posse offering is branded with their logo and the size, 36mm. No country of origin specified on the tool. All in all, a very useful tool for the job.
B0000AXYHK|5|Great wax easy to put on and take off last a long time and shines beautifully
B00HUFY8AG|4|A supply and list of parts would be helpful. Had some extra parts left over and am interested to find out what their function is.<br />Seems to be a good unit so far. Sure, it's no Morimoto brand but the price is more than fair for what you get. Decent cut-off lines, easy install and no missing parts. I retrofit them into a new set of aftermarket 97-03 F150 headlights. Picture attached.
B00EEG7Z36|5|I drive barefoot a lot so I decided to buy these with the hopes that I would get a surface that was smoother without losing grip and these managed to accomplish both. Relatively easy to install with no need to drill holes into the pedals. My only complaint is that certain pedals will be harder to attach these covers to because of the way that they install. I have attached a picture of the installation instructions so that you have a better idea of how this product works and the quality of the stability (completely up to the installer). I would recommend installing it yourself but I would also recommend turning on the A/C or a fan because these covers do not cooperate easily.
B007WR25KW|5|Awesome.. worked wonderfully
B0015DU8O4|5|very well put together ,line bends without kinking nice kit

B000DEMJA2|3|Cable is longer then the stock.  It does not appear that the cable is as thick as the stock cable that broke.
B00DC5TV0A|5|Perfect for what I needed.  Very light and durable.
B00MUG1DCG|5|They're super cute car seat belt covers.  I love that they are a 2 pack so I could use it in both driver and passenger seat.  Too bad my hubby doesn't use it like I do.  They stay put when I have it on and plus Totoro makes a really good face snuggler when I'm at a red light.
B000FW4LMG|3|there OK not exactly what I thought
B000CACMMM|1|This was purchased over other similar product brands because we trusted in thr rainx brand name. We found it easy to put on the car but as we were reading it said to make sure that it was completely full for safety. So we put as much in it as we felt would fill but not over fill, as we were trying to zip it closed the zipper pull broke off incompletely on one side. We managed to make it work to get zipped to leave for the trip. After reloading the bag for the trip home, the other zipper broke. The bag was by any means not over filled to cause the zippers to forcibly break.
B007V2BP6S|5|Your custom sunscreen improved the quality of my car's interior and makes life easier for me.  It is a big help in combating intense summer heat.

B00B102CZY|5|Perfect! The last one started peeling off after a long trailer ride and this one fit right in its spot perfectly. Thick and cushy. Looks nice.
B00JF5LRN0|5|Very sturdy and heavy. You kind of need 2 people to install it. Met my needs! Traveled over 2000 miles behind my Land Rover with no issues.
B001DKRG26|5|Love it
