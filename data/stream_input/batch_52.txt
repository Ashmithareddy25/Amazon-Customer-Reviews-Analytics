B0001ZMWQO|2|I'm not sure why this contrived, by-the-numbers, overhyped \\"alternative\\" CD resonated with so many people in 2004. I was even predisposed to like Franz Ferdinand because of all of the critical rave-ups of this young Scottish band.  Upon repeated listenings, I found little more than a generic rock band using the marketing template of alternative rock. If this is \\"alternative\\", I'll take whatever alternative there is to \\"alternative\\".<br /><br />What is so astounding about this CD is all those critics who about Franz Ferdinand, do little more than compare them to other more inspired alternative bands. Tell me what I'm supposed to like about this band, other than they sound like (pick one:)1.Blondie, 2. The Strokes, 3. Interpol, 4. Radiohead (!) or any number of other bands.  Franz Ferdinand's problem is they have none of the imagination or lyrical sensibility smart pop bands the bands they've been compared to. I've heard the Shins and Franz Ferdinand ain't the Shins, folks. If you can't tell the difference then you need a new set of ears.<br /><br />Franz Ferndinand's problem is a symptom of the larger problem with the entire genre of \\"alternative rock\\" ... Alternative rock is nothing more than the product marketing focus groups. Music for the psuedo-cool who think \\"hipness\\" is just another product to be purchased in the marketplace. Alternative has become ambient music for shopping at the Gap. Much of it sounds bloodless as the rest of the bland warmed-over gruel that the five major record labels serve the consumer.<br /><br />One reviewer praised Franz Ferdinand as being \\"21st Century Duran Duran\\"... Since when is being like Duran Duran a good thing??? Where I grew up, Duran Duran was a posuer \\"haircut band\\" for MTV teenyboppers.  To even compare Franz Ferdinand to bands like Gang of Four and Mission of Burma is so laughable it's like contrasting the music Milli Vanilli to that of Otis Redding.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the current British movement toward angular pop, go straight to the source and spend your hard earned money on: \\"Drums and Wires\\" by XTC, \\"All the Mod Cons\\" by the Jam  \\"Modern Life Is Rubbish\\" by Blur, or the great collection of the Buzzcocks'singles from the 1970s, \\"Singles Going Steady.\\"r pop, go straight to the source and spend your hard earned money on: \\"Drums and Wires\\" by XTC, \\"All the Mod Cons\\" by the Jam  \\"Modern Life Is Rubbish\\" by Blur, or the great collection of the Buzzcocks'singles from the 1970s, \\"Singles Going Steady.\\"
B000001FUZ|5|This recording began as the first Steve Winwood solo album.  Following the departure of Dave Mason from Traffic and a short run with Blind Faith, Winwood decided to go into the studio and try his hand alone.   Before  completing the sessions, he decided to ask fellow Traffic bandmates Chris  Wood and Jim Capaldi to join him in the studio.  As a result, this became  the first recording of a terrific new direction for the band. Unlike it's  predecessors this album drew more heavily from jazz and soul influences.   The trio setting works well as each cut is dead on.  Traffic would go on to  mine this vein further and produce the most creative and significant music  of their career (see Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys, Shootout At The Fantasy  Factory, On The Road and When The Eagle Flies).  Highly recommended...Simon

0060920084|2|This is a very disappointing book!  The premise is that Bryson, raised in Des Moines and now living in England, comes back to revisit some of the places his father took the family on dreadful summer family vacations. The book has a promising start, with a very amusing description of life in Des Moines and rural Iowa.  But once he hits the road (2 big loops, one through the East and one through the West), it gets pretty dreadful.  Bryson never stays long enough anywhere to get to know anything about the places he visits (a few hours in Williamsburg, a few hours at the Grand Canyon, straight through Jackson Hole without stopping,...).  He seems singularly bad a finding pleasant places to stay or decent places to eat.  Bryson doesn't select high or low points to describe in detail, but seems to give about the same emphasis to almost every place he stays. The good thing about this book is that, if you have short periods in which to read something, it's really easy to put this one down in the middle of a chapter.
B002PHVHFI|5|Classic!

B004SEUJK0|5|I love this movie because I always felt so silly and awkward as a girl and during my adulthood.  Everyone seems so smart around me and I realized that I am smart in other ways.  Bridget is so silly.  I can relate to her!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|There's good Grisham, there's really good Grisham, and then there's Great Grisham!  Sycamore Row is in the Great Grisham category.  I was practically out of reach the whole time I was reading and couldn't wait to see how on earth he was going to end this.  Interesting characters of all sorts, lots of conflict, highly recommend it!
B0092QITO2|5|The original Total Recall is still a fun classic movie to watch, but this new one is way better.  It's a little darker and grittier then the original, but that's probably why I like it better.  If you like good action, good twists, and good actors then this movie is definitely for you!

B000DWMYQ8|1|If I told you that \\"Chicken Little\\" was as awful as \\"Barnyard: The Original Party Animals,\\" then you probably wouldn't believe me. Well, believe me when I say that it's not nearly as atrocious as \\"Barnyard,\\" but it's just as annoying. And MAN, was it annoying! I mean, I was annoyed not only by this movie, but annoyed by the fact that this was in fact made by Disney. This is a terrible CGI-animated film that has nothing special to offer. The basic storyline is adapted from the popular children's fable of the same name, but with a twist. Instead of an acorn, it's an actual piece of sky that has fallen....actually, it's a piece of a UFO which turns invisible. It's an interesting premise, but the rest of the movie fails to deliver.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems with \\"Chicken Little\\" is that it lacks substance and intrigue, even as an animated comedy. In \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Monsters Inc.,\\" there was a certain kind of intelligence that dominated the story, and that's what makes them truly special and unique. Here, in \\"Chicken Little,\\" there is no wit, no charm, and no originality whatsoever. I blame the writers for this, for the director would have created a masterpiece if the script actually had something good in it. The characters are even worse. I could care less for these anthropomorphic people: they are just plain annoying! From the Ugly Duckling to Runt of the Litter, they just bring more and more pain. And Chicken Little himself? I don't care for him, either. Aren't you supposed to make the main protagonist interesting and likable? Well, sadly, it doesn't happen here. And speaking of characters, why are we still choosing celebrities to do voice work? I mean, sure, Zach Braff, Joan Cusack, and Garry Marshall are great actors, but this is NOT their specialty. A majority of the characters are miscast, especially the main character. Why does Chicken Little sound like an adult when he's supposed to be a kid? Did the creators think we're stupid? But the absolute worst thing about this CGI atrocity is the lack of humor. This entire film tries too hard to be a family-friendly comedy: the verbal jokes and sight gags are forced and unfunny. It reminded me of \\"Barnyard,\\" and how painfully unfunny that movie was as well. Maybe kids will find it hilarious, but adults like me will definitely not.<br /><br />When I saw that Ebert & Roeper gave this film Two Thumbs Down, I admired them for a moment there. That is what I felt like while watching this film. I will give Chicken Little credit, though, for adding a little twist to the famous fable. It could have been handled almost perfectly, but it simply fails as a result. It's a horribly irritating piece of filth, and I was never entertained by it. What a poor excuse for an animated film.<br /><br />Grade: Fg about this CGI atrocity is the lack of humor.

B00M4ADWTK|5|I loved this movie.  Angelina Jolie was amazing!
B00C7TAF3Y|5|the room is a wonderful game and highly entertaining but short. it only took me a few hours to beat it but we'll worth the money
B004JHY8A8|4|Was kept spellbound by the book even though it is not a book that  one can enjoy as it is also about the Holocaust but it is worth reading.
B003TSEL7S|5|At first I was against reading this series because I didn't think I would like it because nothing compares to the originals. I thought it would be like J.K. Rowling writing about different people at Hogwarts; the originals are always the best! But I decided to give it a chance, and I'm happy I did.<br /><br />I loved Leo, Piper and Jason. They're all so different from one another, so it never got boring. Hearing about their past pulled at my heart strings because they'd all been through so much. Even though Jason has amnesia, we start to learn some things about his past towards the end.<br /><br />There's a lot of twists in the book, and of course, Rick's humor always made me laugh. In Greek mythology, I never really liked Hera, but this book actually made me see a different possible side to why she hates Zeus's children. It opened my mind and even made me feel a bit bad for her. The ending left me amazed and eager to read the next book. If you loved Percy Jackson and The Olympians, I know you'd love this book. I definitely recommend it.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is back again... but why does the check say 1987?!?<br />This shady franchise makes it 10x harder and 10x more scary!!!<br /><br />What an amazing sequel!  Thanks Scott!!! (:
B00C8S9VKM|5|One of Bryson's best!
B00HYFGSPU|5|I always dislike when people put artists in a box, thinking they must sound a certain way from their early years onward. People change, their sounds change, and who they are will always shine through on their tracks.<br /><br /> I love their early Britpop work and their Indie Rock, their Zombie Hip-hop and their Chinese techno opera; but this album proves that you don't have to shout to get a point across. It shows the beauty that can be found in minimalism. It's wonderful and mature, so to speak. When artists grow older and begin to strip away the excess, one can understand the rawness of this album. Those who can't appreciate this album are the true everyday robots (Haha) At any rate, it is surprising that this is his first solo album. It is always intriguing to see what happens when artists stand alone.<br /><br />Of course, everyone has their different tastes, but I know what I'll be enjoying while designing, drawing or sewing.
B001EIOOV8|5|Fantastic movie
B00DPM90C4|2|Ok for a beach read, but too many distracting political comments and just plain silly language. Cheesy asides slowed the pace of what could have been a real page turner.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I couldn't tear myself away for even a minute. Each twist was so unpredictable and thrilling. Every character was so unique but relatable, absolutely mesmerizing!!!!
B003L77GG0|5|Awesome series!!!!
B000AJIF4E|5|I heard these were the best so my expectactions were very high... well, the product delivered! Amazing sound and very comfortable. The high range is fantastic and the bass is noticeable but not overpowering.
B0038P9LTU|5|Enjoyed this CD very much.  These guys keep cranking out great music!  Impressed with the quick delivery of the CD.
B005OGYHB8|5|After five albums with GN'R, two with Snakepit, two with Velvet Revolver and one solo, Slash has released his first official live album \\"Made In Stoke\\" (many shows were recorded and available at concerts). This two-disc set traces Slash's entire career with each stage recieving attention. More obscure songs from Snakepit were played at the show, over more well-known songs from Velvet Revolver, which may not be to everyone's liking, but with only 21 songs to pick from, the setlist can't please everyone. Slash's rendition of \\"The Godfather,\\" a staple from Guns N' Roses \\"Use Your Illusion\\" tour is a nice touch.<br /><br />On this performance, each song song blends seamlessly into the next, as Slash's band make these songs their own, never seeming like a cover band. In his detailed liner notes, legendary rock critic Malcolm Dome seems to confer, noting that Slash and singer Myles Kennedy have \\"been able to reinvent the singer's back catalog.\\" Kennedy, from the band Alter Bridge, is a polished and powerful singer and is able to add his own signature to these songs without ruining them. While Kennedy sang two songs on Slash's debut, he is set to be the sole singer on Slash's next album, which should be something to look forward to.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Slash fans and rock fans in general.
B00DYTKKGI|3|My 4 year old nephew likes it. Plays this game before any of the others. It seems to keep him busy for the few minutes he is allowed to stay on it.
B006DJ2JSI|1|Would not take me to the meaning of the word(s).
B0060CX8F6|5|I love the storyline in this movie. It's a little scary, and there's black magic (voodoo) but it's about New Orleans so you can't leave that out. The music is wonderful, the morale (yea a Disney story with a morale!) is about hard work, balanced life and focusing on what you have.<br /><br />A must watch family classic!
B00KA87GCW|4|Fun, doesn't require much brain power.
B0054JELS4|2|Season five  of this set is missing 4 episodes. Dvds are labeled correctly but they don't have the shows that are listed on them. Season one didn't have disc 5 correct. It was the same as disc 4 but with a disc 5 label. Not finished with the series yet. Hope I don't find anymore mistakes.
B00LXLM05I|5|Challenging and fun
B005GFPZYK|5|In this time eveyone should read what actually went on in the area.  It is not the place for those who have not been to war to state that he should not have been doing this job, but he was protecting his fellow comrads.  This was a job he was trained for and he did it very well.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Got it a couple nights ago, and connected it right away. My DVD payer plays Netflix and everything else but not the Amazon Prime movies. This baby took care of that in a hurry.
B004TJ1H2I|5|Classic . . . . Always a great movie to see over and over and over again
B007SGM084|5|Simply incredible. Looking forward to more from E L James, you will not put this book down. A great book.
B0054PSY2W|5|I have seen this so many times
0790729369|5|Anyone who calls this a snooze fest is scared to death of themselves.  This is a true love story.  Its about a romance that keep people alive whether they dream of it or in this case actually get to live it.  I hope someday to meet Mr Eastwood and Ms. Streep and thank them for doing this movie.  Watch the movie, read the book and dont be ashamed to cry and to dream and cry some more.  It's ok.  It's a beautiful story of something so special that few us ever get to feel.  I am a deep romatic and love to write love songs and play them on my guitar.  I have been married to my wife for 26 yrs.  We dream of finding someone who really cares about us and appreciates us and doesnt take us for granted. Some people are threatened by those who can openly share there dreams and secrets.  They are ahsamed of being.  I dream of true love and romance.   To find someone to slow dance with under the stars to the music of each others hearts.....  Someone to hold hands with, and feel so damn happy you pray to God it will never end.  Thats what this movie and story does for me.  Cheers.
B00FAPF5U0|5|It's a good game it relaxes you and challenges you at the same time. Great game for anyone who likes to be challenged.
B00KK0PICK|2|At first, reading the first few chapters of the book inspired me.  I liked the idea of culling my things first, then organizing them.  I liked the idea of holding each item in my hand before I can accurately determine if I should keep it or not.  But, unfortunately, as the book continued, the author's methods made less and less sense to me.  It's late so I can't recall when her suggestions starting getting a little &#34;out there&#34; but I don't think I'll be implementing many of her suggestions.
B008FRFN7A|1|I tried to use this on my Android tablet to print an important document. Once I went through the steps, I have an HP laser printer but when I signed in gmail account, it still wouldn't work. So it also mentioned that you had to register the HP on the mobile. So it never printed the document I wanted and wasn't as easy to use as I had presumed it would be. Since it was ePrint, I thought it would scan the printer wirelessly and then print the document needed on the tablet. Laptop was out of commission and needed this printed from my email account.<br /><br />I tried a couple others from Googleplay but none worked when needed.
B00KY7PEAA|3|Cool
B004FLAYXI|5|This is a really Awesome Package for the film \\"Inception\\". I recommend getting while and if you can.  It's a rare find.
B001W63DX2|3|Great to have some new stuff, but most of the long time fans have been waiting for a remastered version of Maiden England. Hopefully that comes out soon?
B00000G3Q4|5|After just a half an hour of watching The Evil Dead I was blown' away at what a great and notable job the collage studnts that made this groudbraker as good as they did, and scary too.<BR>As a matter of facted I think reson that The Evil Dead was created so skillfuly buy kids not much older than my 15 year old self, is reson enough to call this cult classic the best( if not one of the best) horror films ever created, just like what almost everyone ealse thinks, even though it takes bits and peaces out other classics like House on Hunted Hill, (the overly long) Night of the Dead seires and my personal favorite The Exoricist.<br />The story begins with a five collage bubbies going up to the hills for the weaked just to have some fun, but what they get instead is the satanic Book of the Dead wich is an old book put together by human flesh and writen in blood, and it opens the doors to another world I don't anyone would like to spend much time. One by one the kids die in very, very, very bloody ways. That is the reson why even if your expecting alot of gore it might be just to much. Sam Rami shows us brains smashed up, rolling body parts and the whole nine yards as far as lots of gore gose, but I think that how gorey the sepcial effects are   is reson to love this even more, because even the special effects have some how faded over the years, but we must remember it was only film studnets that made this the hit was and the hit it deseved to be.<br />This is a great Special Edition disk in mind, but if you don't own this already you might want to wait for the other Special Edition DVD set to come out in a month or so from right now.<br />Just in case you don't want to speand the mony on the newer edition that is soon to be released then I beilve this is this edition is worth every penny.<br />If your a horror fan, and liked this as much as I did then you should pick up a Sepcial Edition copy of The Evil Dead 2, and Amy of Darkness, wich is the third movie from the Evil Dead seirs and is very funny.
B00BAXFECK|5|Although the book is long it doesn't feel that way. You're in it every minute! I've never read a story like it. Very unique plot! Great read!
B00BWBHIUG|1|the story took so long I havent done it - might be good for anyone with kids but not for adults
B00K2CHWOI|3|Meh...a bit humorous every time he was killed (despite his objections), but other than that, your typical over the top action movie that apparently is aimed at the usual 18 to 35 year old male!?    I thought Oblivion was much, much better, and had a fantastic soundtrack to boot, both of which I purchased for my collection.    I can't see pulling this one off the shelf down the road for a repeat viewing.
1582701709|4|I heard about the book from a co-worker.  My co-worker and I share our experiences using the techniques each and every day we work together.  She supports my visual pictures and my picture wall. I support her and give her the same positive feedback that I receive.  We are much happier and calmer individuals.  We have both received comments that we look different, in a good way, and that we both appear to have lost weight and look younger. We both smile. Our lives have been changed for the better.  We are the ones that have made the change due to knowing the true secret to a better life. <br /> <br />This book has helped me to realize the negative effect of the 'programming' that has occurred throughout my life has contributed to who I am today, how I react to various situations that have occurred in my life and what I can do to turn the tables around and live the rest of my life as a truly happy, strong spiritually and emotionally; and financially better person. <br /> <br />The key is to take what you need from the book and apply it every single moment of your life.
B000ROALCG|5|The soundtrack performed by Marc Anthony was nothing short of perfect  He assimilated himself into the persona of Hector Lavoe in ways that were almost eerie.  Lavoe was a legend and Marc is another living legend who someday will have a movie depicting his own life.  The only thing I would have hoped for were a few more songs on the cd. In particular a song called Periodico de Ayer which was one of Lavoe's greatest and actually was in the movie so I didn't quite get why it wasn't there on the cd. All in all, if you are a Hector Lavoe afficionado or a Marc Anthony lover then you absolutely NEED to have this in your collection.
B0036S4B6M|5|Really really liked this. I watched the 1st season on Netflix, and really enjoyed it, so I got the book. After reading several unfavorable reviews, I was a little putt off. However, after just finishing it, I'm saddened that I'm done. I think Ms Kerman is an excellent writer, able to bring me into prison with her. I just can't convey enough how much I liked this book :)
B00II5YUIW|5|I love this game! It blends mystery, excitement, and hidden item games into one great game! I also like that it allows you to play some of the game before you decide if you want to buy it or not. You won't regret getting this one, it's so much fun!
B00W3V83QW|3|OK game
B000FVNX2Q|3|I am studying for the CFP exam and my books use the 12C so I got this one.  I read many reviews and I'd have to say I agree with those who lament the drop in quality from the good old days of the 80s and 90s.  The buttons feel thin and plasticy instead of solid as before.  The display is hard to read in any light due to a mirror-like film that lays over the LCD.  I could get angry about these types of issues and give 1 star, but I'm staying at 3 because it does lay flat on the desk and doesn't move.  It also looks &#34;official&#34; so when you whip it out at a meeting you look cool.  The keypad on the side and functions on the left is a timelessly cool thing.  Also the color of the function button is a lame orange that doesn't match the red of the functions.  Anyway - this is probably the best one you can get - so I guess get it and write a letter to HP telling them to get back to quality manufacturing to make business people lifelong customers rather than make that extra $3 per calculator.
B004EBT5CU|5|I can't stop listening to this cd. Adele's voice is hauntingly beautiful. You will not be disappointed if you get it.

B000OPPBEQ|5|First off, this is the 3rd Matrix collection that I have owned. I purchased the original trilogy individually, then the Ultimate Colection on DVD and now this blu-ray release. I knew eventually that I would need to scale up to blu-ray, but was always worried that I would \\"lose\\" some of the special features.<br /><br />The Matrix movies are certainly one of my all time favorites (next to Star Wars and LOTR) so I didn't want to down grade by purchasing the blu-ray set. Let me start off by saying - this is not the case. I don't know that the promotional material has done a good enough job explaining what you get on this release, but there certainly are some differences.<br /><br />The DVD's were on 10 disks- but, the blu-ray set is on 6. You get 4 blu-rays (one for each movie) and then a set of 2 DVD's for the bonus features. The Zion Archive DVD is exactly the same as the one from the Ultimate DVD set - and then the \\"Burly Man\\" and \\"Roots\\" DVD's are mashed together on either side of a single disk.  But here is the break down for the rest of the disks and since I own all of them - let me show you exactly what you get comparing the original DVD release, to the Ultimate DVD release to the now Ultimate Blu-ray release:<br /><br />1.1 Matrix DVD<br />* 2 Commentaries the actor track and the music only commentary with Don Davis<br />* Making the Matrix<br />* Bullet time (as an Easter egg)<br /><br />1.2 Ultimate Matrix DVD<br />* 2 Commentaries \\"the philosopher\\" and the \\"critic\\"<br />* The music revisited<br />* Behind the matrix<br />* Take the red pill<br />* Follow the white rabbit.<br /><br />1.3 The Matrix blu-ray<br />* All 4 commentaries together. (great feature)<br />* Everything from the Ultimate DVD plus:<br />* The Music Revisited<br />* Rock is Dead Music Video<br />* Trailers and TV spots<br /><br />2.1 Reloaded DVD<br />* The Matrix unfolds<br />* Pre-load<br />* Get me an exit<br />* The MTV movie awards reloaded<br /><br />2.2 Ultimate Reloaded DVD<br />* 2 Commentaries \\"the philosopher\\" and the \\"critic\\"<br />* Car chase<br />* Teahouse fight<br />* Unplugged<br />* I'll handle them<br />* The exiles<br />* Enter the matrix the game<br />* All 23 live action shots from Enter the Matrix the game<br /><br />2.3 Ultimate Reloaded Blu-Ray<br />* Everything from both previous editions including:<br />* P.O.D. music video<br />* Theatrical and TV Trailers<br /><br />3.1 Revolutions DVD<br />* Revolutions recalibrated<br />* CG revolution<br />* Super Burly Brawl<br />* Future Gamer<br />* Before the Revolution<br />* 3-D evolution<br />* Operator<br /><br />3.2 Ultimate Revolutions DVD<br />* Crew<br />* Hell<br />* Super burly brawl<br />* New blue world<br />* Siege<br />* After math<br /><br />3.3 Ultimate revolutions Blu-Ray<br />* Everything from both previous editions including:<br />* Neo realism - the evolution of bullet time<br />* Super big mini models<br />* Double agent smith<br />* Mind over matter<br /><br />In addition, each Blu-Ray features an in-Movie experience. The IME is included on all 3 of the Matrix films. The IME is an exclusive interactive feature that allows viewers to enjoy new ways of accessing interviews and other material while the movie is running. For these titles, the IME will let viewers experience via picture in picture the evolution of all The Matrix's ground breaking elements through the recollections of the cast and creative team.<br /><br />So you are not losing anything with this set.<br /><br />The negatives: first the thing that bummed me out the most... no fun menus. Each menu is a static matrix code screen shot (that doesn't even move) it looks like the wallpaper that you had on your desktop back in high school. You'd think on a blu-ray disk, you'd get something fun and awesome, but it's boring, there are not even little transition videos like the other releases had. Oh well.<br /><br />Second, I play my movies on a Playstation 3 and all of my Blu-rays show up with the title, an icon and perhaps even music from the movie. These discs all show up as an unknown file. Not even a title - you can't tell which disk is in the player from the PS3 menu. Kinda lame.<br /><br />Other than that - these movies have never looked or sounded better. Amazing transfer! I watched these on my new HD-TV with my surround sound up and I felt like I was back in the theatre. Definitely pick these up!t like I was back in the theatre. Definitely pick these up!

B00005Q45W|5|I have &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; (track 7) on virtual repeat... can't stop going back to it over and over again.  This record is a chilling masterpiece.  Though I would like to hear a version with a full band behind it (as opposed to this demo-ish synth backing), the synths work well in their own idiosyncratic way, augmenting Mr. Cohen's unique vision.  Whatever.  This record is the sound of sublime, absolute heartbreak, and you wouldn't want it any other way.

0743298039|3|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield is a very intriguing novel that tells the story of family, twin-hood, devotion, deceit, and life. It is well written and there are many traces of an experienced author for this first time writer. However Setterfield's immaturity does show in a few areas for the experienced reader.<br />The Thirteenth Tale brings us one Margaret Lea, an obsessive reader and amateur biographer employed by her (even more obsessive) father in his book store - not just any book store however, one that specializes in books that you must search the corners of the earth to find. One day Margaret is summoned to pen the autobiography of acclaimed writer Vida Winter. Although she is a book enthusiast, she has yet to read any of Ms. Winters work. After much deliberation she decides to do it, but why her?<br />From this point on we experience two stories. One: Ms. Winters coveted story of her life, her loss, her obsessions, and her trials throughout a long, tumultuous life. Two: Margaret's battle with her past demons as she slowly sees more and more similarities between herself and this reclusive writer as she unfolds her tale.<br />I thought this story was well written, especially for a first-time author. She wrote different stories from different peoples' points of view and made them very clear through distinct differences in their mannerisms and overall writing. Some analogies she used were worthy of Hemingway (I'm a guy that loves a good analogy).<br />I did, however, see some things that I think some experience would help Ms. Setterfield in her future endeavors. The end of the book seemed to take forever to come about. It didn't just end; there were one or two more things that she kept telling you. She left a couple of loose strings and tied them together in the final 3 pages, a personal pet-peeve of mine. A book should unwind itself more smoothly.<br />I would definitely recommend The Thirteenth Tale (especially if you're a twin). I also think that future writings from this young writer will be worth reading and I personally am looking forward to reading them. Please enjoy.from this young writer will be worth reading and I personally am looking forward to reading them. Please enjoy.
B0070Y46UY|5|Excellent ending that reinvents the novel from the first word.  Vivid storytelling and fascinating narrative find amazing meaning in the conclusion.
B00005JO1Y|3|Another solidly packed midnight preview screening and the film clocks in at over 3 hours!   <br /> <br />Well, where to start, eh? <br /> <br />I've avoided the trailers, reviews, posters, etc, so that my experience would not be tainted by advance publicity. Thus, I sat in the theatre like a newborn virgin expecting the first tinges of excitement. <br /> <br />The script, although containing several new plot threads, follows the classic formula set down by the original film. The first hour is spent building up the characters, setting up the mystery and allowing some comedy elements to seep in. <br /> <br />Jack Black, who I normally abhor, is acceptable in his role as the megalomaniac director pursuing a doomed project, Adrien Brody has enough charm in his eyes to carry off his role as secondary hero, Andy Serkis as the ship's cook and Kong is simply awesome, Noami Watts lacks the raw eroticism of Jessica Lange and the primordial energy of Fay Wray but she bestows her role with acres of bubbly charisma. The chemistry between her and Kong is palpable and time is given to showcase their tragic romance. <br /> <br />The film has been lovingly created by Peter Jackson and his team of film magicians but there are several moments where the CGI effects look flakey and unvarnished. However, the pacing never wavers and any technical deficiency is easily overlooked by the sheer scale of the adventure which rampages across the screen. The artistic design of the film is beautifully realized and no expense has been spared in creating a mammoth world of danger and suspense. The natives of Skull Island are terrifying in a hallucinatory manner (someone should immediately give Jackson a CANNIBAL / ZOMBIE project next).  <br /> <br />Those amongst us who may deride the film for lacking any intelligent muscle, I simply say just take a moment and ponder upon the sly political subtext that Jackson has weaved into his film. The allusion to recent world events and the ensuing bloodshed islaid bare in the poignant climax. There is also much made of Joseph Conrad's THE HEART OF DARKNESS in the banter between the cabin boy, Jamie Bell, and the ship's Second Mate.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack, as with the recent NARNIA, never really soars and the main love theme lacks the melodic emotional resonance that should impale the hardest of hearts when Kong and his love spend a few tender moments as the sun sets on their world. <br /> <br />Okay, the film may not be as groundbreaking in the way the original one was, but it still has tons of innovation and high octane adventure to capture the minds of most people. <br /> <br />Recommended. <br />
B00FFHG6KQ|5|This app is awesome. If you are think this is a game as good as the Xbox, you got another thing coming. This app is only a good game to pass the time. If you can buy the Xbox version. Console games never disappoint.
B008YWY0HK|5|I bought this video for my grand daughter and she loves it. When she visits she wants to watch it.
1250030951|5|Let me disclose this first: I’m not normally a reader of contemporary fiction. Due to this, this novel was out of my comfort zone for sure, though the scenes of fanfiction helped tremendously with that. How, do you ask, did I manage to rate this book so highly? Well, it resonated with me. More specifically, Cath resonated with me on so many levels.<br /><br />How do I describe Cath’s character? It was almost as if a former roommate of mine and myself were combined into a single fictional character. My roommate is an identical twin. We both have dabbled into fan creations and are super nerdy. I have anxiety issues that I fight on a daily basis. And, to top it off, Cath starts college the same semester that her and I did. It was almost creepy how many things were similar. And because of that, it was so easy to root for and love Cath.<br /><br />While I can’t speak for the twin side of things, I felt like this book handled anxiety issues incredibly well. There were so many scenes where I would be saying things like “YES YES RAINBOW THAT’S EXACTLY HOW IT FEELS” and others where I felt for Cath so much because I was in so many similar emotional situations in college. Rainbow Rowell manages to capture the chest and stomach tightening feeling of anxiety so well, and the irrational things it makes you do, like avoiding a dining hall for a month.<br /><br />I LOVED the relationship between Levi and Cath. It was refreshing to have a nice boy for once be a romantic interest! The amount of drama and romance in the relationship also was just right without going overboard, which felt great for a freshman in college who is still nervous about the more intimate aspects of relationships. I FELT for her when she had initial trust issues. And there were definitely moments where I would internally scream KISS KISS KISS!<br /><br />Why not five stars, then? For some reason I felt that the ending was a bit lackluster in comparison to the rest of the book. Perhaps it’s because there’s a sense of life continuing, but I felt like it could have felt, I dunno, more like an ending? I can understand why Rowell decided to end her novel in such a manner, but I think I’m one of those who prefers a bit more conclusion to her books and I was sad not to hear more about Carry On. On that note, I am so glad that it’s coming out as a novel in the next couple months!se there’s a sense of life continuing, but I felt like it could have felt, I dunno, more like an ending?

B0050DIWFC|1|As you may have gathered by now, Defending Jacob is a story of a 14-year-old son of a DA that is accused of murdering the boy bullying him, told from the point of view of the aforementioned father. An incredibly thought-provoking premise, horrendously and amateurishly executed.<br /><br />There are so many plot holes I can't even cover them all. NONE of the characters are likable, except perhaps characters that only get about three total pages worth of coverage. I suspect that's the only reason they remained likable. The \\"OMG HUGE PLOT TWIST!!!!\\" at the end? Predictable. Saw it coming. In fact, I saw the entire ending coming.<br /><br />I'm irritated not only that I read the whole thing, which was incredibly predictable and poorly-written, but also because it could've gone in a completely. different. direction. And that would've been awesome. The murder itself wasn't really explained or, in spite of the endless pages devoted to the \\"evidence\\", gone over at all. Why not take that tack, fill in that angle a bit? And while I understand that being accused of murder would probably make you something of a pariah, we're expected to believe that not ONE single person stood by this family, when the mother was supposedly the pillar of grace and strength for the community? Right.<br /><br />Quite frankly, this book was awful. If you rated it 5 Stars, you probably also found 50 Shades of Grey to be the BEST BOOK EV-AR. Take that as you will.
B0053FANS6|5|Great clear picture. Makes the experience better!
006202406X|1|Were my expectations were too high because I gobbled up the first two books and the third felt like such a long wait?<br /><br />Have I finally matured past being able to digest YA?<br /><br />OR..<br /><br />Perhaps not all YA cash cows, ahem \\"series\\" need to be trilogies.<br /><br />If you haven't read the first two books in this series, please do! If you have read them and they got you super excited, please don't read this one. It will be a let down.<br /><br />In summary, nothing really happens. The parts that are supposed to be exciting are predictable and anti-climatic. Man, I just finished it and am just feeling so let down. After Book 2, I was so excited to see what would be outside the city... spoiler alert, you never really get past O'Hare (talk about a nightmare in itself). You have about a million \\"WHY?!\\" questions, none of which get poked in the slightest.<br /><br />The most exciting part involves first person narrative on what it's like to fly on an airplane. Maybe it was one giant product placement for Southwest? No, that can't be, Southwest safety demos are more exciting than this.. must have been from Frontier. First you take away cookies, then $100 for a carry on, now this?! You are my one true enemy, Frontier! Will you stop at nothing to rid the world of joy?

B00DPM7TIG|5|One of the best books I have read in a long time! I definitely recommend it!
B000KGGLCU|5|This album makes me so happy! Why on earth did it take Madonna so long to start releasing live albums?! \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\\" came out a couple of years ago, and it was absolutely fabulous. I'm guessing that's why \\"The Confessions Tour\\" was released, and I am so glad that it was! The CD features 13 songs from the \\"Confessions\\" tour that were recorded during a performance in London. The quality of this album is fantastic! Every time I listen to it, I feel like I'm in the audience watching Madonna performing. Yes, these tracks are mostly all songs from the \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" CD, but they're live and remixed and different and wonderful! In addition to new favorites like \\"Hung Up,\\" \\"Jump,\\" \\"Future Lovers,\\" and \\"I Love New York,\\" the album also includes some classic old-school Madonna songs, such as \\"Lucky Star,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" and \\"Like a Virgin.\\"<br /><br />Picking a favorite track on this CD is almost impossible, but I think I have to go with \\"Music Inferno.\\" It's such a fun new take on a fabulous Madonna song, and it was also one of my favorite parts of the \\"Confessions\\" tour. (Those white John Travolta suits were fantastic!)<br /><br />I really wish the song \\"Get Together\\" was on the CD, but at least it's on the DVD. And speaking of the DVD...WOW! It's absolutely fantastic. The DVD features many more songs than the CD and also includes several behind-the-scenes bonus features.<br /><br />\\"The Confessions Tour\\" is a dazzling musical experience that's a must-have for all Madonna fans!
B003ODIZL6|3|It's helpful for school but not much more so it is more for younger kids then adults so a 3 star rating
0780626966|5|I was more than happy when this box set arrived. It even came witht he 3D glasses. I was so excited. It was stated that it was used but it was in excellent shape. I would def suggest this buyer to anyone!
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is my first experience with this game on my Kindle. I can't put it down. It definitely keeps your mind sharp. I would suggest you try it out!
B0071PS7AC|1|Horrid controls, bad interface. There is simply nothing good to say about this game except that it was free. Uninstalled
B004498KPU|1|maybe some people like this, Its not what I hoped it to be.  Not happy
B00D41AJ7G|4|It's a simple game where you're shown the end product and have to come up with the process. The only thing I would change is that it only had 40-some levels. I would want more. I got it as a free app, but if I had paid for it, I would have been disappointed with how quickly I got through it.
B00004XONN|5|While it does lack in number of songs, Kid A makes up for it in length and quality. An odd, yet interesting rock/techno album with the same classic goodness of Radiohead. This CD has tunes from slow and strange techno, to fast and catchy jazz elements. Plus, with unreleased songs such as Egyptian Song, and Dollars and Cents, I can't wait for a fifth album sometime soon. If you liked Ok Computer, then you'll definitely want to pick this one up as soon as you can.
B00009NDB8|4|The book was very well written and made you want to keep reading till done.  Very gripping.

What an exquisite appreciation, from his profane to his holy to his rock and roll!  <br />I'm still on the path, gentle,  silly, forgiving, celebratory....  <br />As the Dalai Lama said, \\"My religion is Kindness\\".  <br />Thank you, George, again and again and again!
B000UJ48UO|5|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and for that price its more than enough, fully recommended.

B00OICLVBI|5|A must read !!
B000OZ0NXA|5|I have read a number of the Reacher novels but it was good to see where it all started and it was interesting to see him become distracted to the female lead, in the books I have read so far he doesn't really attach to them, so seeing him do so gave the ending a little more gravity.
B00SCTYIFO|2|The book itself is fine, but the narrator has the most repulsive female impersonation voice.  That really spoils it for me.
0061692042|5|Thought the book was one of the best I have read in a long time.  Character development, setting descriptions, wonderful language.  I intend to read some of his others very soon. I'm not surprised he won the Pulitzer Prize for one of his previous books.
0812550706|5|\\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card is, in my opinion, one of the best books of the time, despite the fact that it was first written over twenty years ago.  The characters are memorable, the plot intense and interesting.  This book is a must-read for everybody.  Whether you are an adult, a teenager like me, or even as young as ten, you will love it.  In it, the Buggers, an intelligent alien species, are a threat to humanity.  They have already struck twice with devastating consequences leaving the world on its knees.  But, this has created world peace for a short time, for fear of a common enemy.  The International Fleet is testing and taking the best and brightest children, starting at age seven, and bringing them up into space for military training.  The adults are hoping to find a boy that they can train to beat the Buggers, but now, time is running out.  Their best bet is Ender Wiggin, but can this boy save the world?
B008N1V11U|5|I loved the game and my dad had to stop me from playing the entire thing in a day! Though I don't understand the trees, they look like they have paper leaves.
B000KIPD5E|5|What a great little gizmo. I play both acoustic and electric guitar at my church and there is only one input on the board for me. No more unplugging/plugging in-between songs. Just a push on the pedal and I'm switching noiselessly between guitars. I can also adjust the input level for each guitar as well.
B00632HWOG|4|Works well and I enjoy it allot.  Works like you are on your PC or Mac.  Try it if you get the chance.
B006C1DH92|4|I can definitely see why this is an addictive game but not my thing personally.  Works fine on Evo 4g phone
B00NQKWAIQ|4|I've always felt that the two best tracks on The Division Bell were the instrumental pieces \\"Marooned\\" and \\"Cluster One\\".  So it's nice to hear some additional instrumental work from that period, touched up with modern technology.  This is a cool album - 4 stars on first listen....waiting to see if that 5th star grows on me.    And even though Waters is still not in the line-up, the sounds on this album are obviously the Floyd (some bits and pieces even harken back to the Meddle/Obscured by Clouds era).    It is, and will always be, great to hear these guys do their thing.  So if this is indeed it, then thanks gents for all of the amazing tunes and fond memories!!
B00F7YHDWC|4|I like the game. It's worth buying. If you can't figure out<br />some of the levels (which,  belive me has happend to<br />me before) you shouldn't give up right away even though you might really wan't to do. You should get it.

B000007PI9|1|This movie is the worst movie ever made! I hated it. I had to watch it in school last year, and I laughed at it the whole time. I did , however learn one thing from it: if you are ever being pursued by crazy axe wielding maniacs, it is safe to be in the car with Stalone. You will not be injured even if the car flips over 17 times. Oh yeah, and 1 person can take on an army, because they always wait to strike....
B007REV4T8|4|Of the three Daniel Craig has starred in as Bond I liked this one best. A evil villain is out to destroy Bond and M and all of the agents in the M16. There are some good action scenes. Example... Bond chases a bad guy on roof tops of buildings both riding motorcycles. It is a darker, colder more serous Bond film than a lot of the other Bonds. Bond doesn't have all the high tech fancy gadgets in this film like some of the others but he doesn't need them. Bond shows more vulnerability in this movie than previous ones. I really liked it.
B00BGIC2J2|2|i haad to wait for this to come on instant for what felt like forever... after all that time, it wasn't worth it. i usually love paul rudd, but not really in this one. :/
0060887966|4|The alchemist is as casual or as profound a read as you want it to be.  The book has a very 'Arabian Nights' tale feel to it.  The story is simple but inspiring.  <br />The cover of the book is exotic and the water colour illustrations in the book are DREAMY and BEAUTIFUL!  <br />The book reminds us and encourages us to follow our dreams.  <br />However, I think that a little bit of the book is lost in translation. The writing is a little unimpressive... but over all a good read especially during those lazy summer afternoons.
B00KWVZ750|5|It's a cool game
006016848X|5|This book is something everyone should read. It makes so much sense. Not all of it might pretain to you, but I'm sure most of it will...and what doesn't will pretain to someone you know. Its also good for a laugh.
B00028HBKM|5|It was almost like being there. Some have said it was too bloody. I think that in the current social climate, people are so desensitized by gore in the media, movies, television, etc. that the sanitized versions of the passion are inadequate. People today are very visual, so I thank Gibson for giving us a more realistic version. I look forward to more films with this vision of detail and accuracy.  <br /> <br />And for those people who think it was a bad movie because you didn't get more of what Jesus was all about or His teachings, you really missed the point of the movie. It's about Jesus' LAST 12 HOURS of life on earth. During that time, He really wasn't preaching to the general public. He did that before those last hours. Gibson is a Catholic. He knows the teachings of Jesus. I am a Catholic and grew up being taught those teachings as well. I have an understanding of Jesus and His teachings. For those lacking that knowledge and wanting it, I suggest picking up a book. <br />
B00G4EXNNM|3|Frankly I thought the songs were going to be the Everly Brothers songs that I know and love. Songs like Dream, Dream, Dream, Let it be Me, Cathy's Clown. Instead I didn't recognize one of these songs. Billie Joe and Nora are really good together, but the songs were too obscure for me.
B009XIXVU6|5|At first, I was angry at myself for giving in to the lure of this book, brought on by rave reviews by others.  Based in Afghanistan, and probably accurate in its descriptions, names, and storyline, it was very hard for me to follow at first.  I couldn't get the foreign names straight, and felt almost hostile to the characters.  However, as it moved along, and wove its tale that covers several decades, I was enthralled.  It is very deep, its message meaningful, and I really loved it.  Prepare to immerse yourself in the beauty of the prose, and the emotions of the characters.  It's worth the effort.
B003O86FMW|5|Last spring I was flying to a work conference & my coworker was reading the 1st & 2nd books. On the plane ride there were a couple of others also in their late 20's reading them. My coworker said they were really good books. A month or two ago my 10 year old daughter begged to get them on our kindles. She read all 3 books in about a week I bet & just raved about them! She has been hounding me to read them, especially with the 2nd movie coming out shortly. So, about a week ago I started the 1st one & just finished the 2nd & can't wait to start the 3rd hear in just a minute!
B0084IG8TM|5|I bought this for my daughter. She loves it
B007X16GFC|2|I've certainly enjoyed some of the amazing films that Mark Wahlberg has done over the past few years. Also, Kate Beckinsale shows us once again that she is not just a pretty face, but is a really talented actress. Overall, the acting in this movie is pretty good. The cast is a strong ensemble of some very talented people. Walhberg and Beckinsale's talent shows through, while others, who I know to be good actors struggled.<br />  I'm not a picky movie person unless I want to be. That is, when I don't like something, I begin to notice every fault it has. To be clear I love action movies with not a lot of plot and great action sequences. Put together a decent plot and blow some things up and I'll be one happy moviegoer. This movie couldn't even manage that. The Direction was downright awful. The really talented actors were able to make you believe their characters dispite this, but others, who I have really enjoyed watching in other things just couldn't pull it off. This is not surprising considering how truly awful the script was. I felt like there was half the story missing, most movies of this genre start with \\"the last job\\" before \\"retirement,\\" then move onto how the protagonist gets dragged into one last job to save their family, friends etc. This movie dumps you halfway into a plot with the characters giving lame, forced explanations of \\"the past life.\\"<br />  I don't mind a predictable plot, I don't mind a plot with twists and turns. This movie managed to have twists I didn't expect, but was more confused by then surprised. It was predictable in places, but it all seemed too convenient. Instead of those tense moments where you don't know how the characters are going to get out of it, but somehow they do, those moments are skipped altogether, and they are explained later on like a great problem was solved, even though you didn't know there was one.<br />  Since I'm being a movie snob, the cinematography was sub par and the editing was not much better then I coulddo with my Mac Book Pro and iMovie. The movie had a strange coloring too it, that I just didn't see any reason for. Yes, I know you can color-balance the movie to look \\"gritty\\" but at least have a good reason for it.<br />  My movie standards aren't that high (as I said, when I don't like something, I'll see every problem). I love the Die-Hard tetralogy (which are excellent), movies like \\"Shooter\\" (which is totally underrated) \\"The transporter\\" and even \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\" This movie couldn't even meet my pretty low standards for an action films. Don't waste your time and money on this snorer.
B0055S348W|4|Finally, and I say this because I have tried several others, a program that will talk to my Epson Workforce 645!!!  Would have given it a 5 star if I could figure out how to print email coupons from my Gmail account but that may be more my Kindle Fire than this app.
B00APUQJLO|5|This is a great, movie.  Twisted, as it is, it makes you think twice at how and why we think the way we do.
B00004XONN|5|KID A proved to me once and for all, that no matter how different Radiohead try to be they still wind up with that same old, awe-inspiring ability to make great music.  Come to think of it, I find it absolutely amazing that I've yet to hear an LP from Radiohead that I consider to be less than brilliant.<br />More specifically, KID A contains so many new styles, sounds, departures from the \\"norm\\" and instant classics that it feels more like a greatest hits compilation with entries taken over several years work.  In a way, I guess it is, considering they've recorded a lot more than 10 songs since 97's OK Computer.  Just try comparing Optimistic with Kid A, or Motion Picture Soundtrack with The National Anthem.<br />The only tip: give it time to sink in - it takes a while before you can truly appreciate what you're listening to - and once you're there, you'll listen to it another million times trying to explore every nuance of it.
B001IBIHQ4|3|Much more historically-minded than 'Band of Brothers', the Pacific effectively gives any history buff perhaps more than he was expecting.<br />NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!  Some nudity/sexuality and much worse in terms of violence and gore than 'B.o.B' !!!!!<br /><br />After watching Pacific, I was compelled to return BoB to my DVD player for a comparison.  BoB, in my conclusion, is a far more entertaining narrative and gives more artistic liberties than Pac, which is more documentary-style and flows closer to real-life than BoB.  Character development was a little shallow in Pac. as there are simply too many characters to follow to get to know them very well.  However, any fan of war documentaries will find the day-to-day of these Pacific marines well-researched and fascinating!  A must see!!!!
B005CGI4EG|5|Awesome show, got it for a good price too, will definitely buy again as gifts for others. Really great deal
B004VMVTNU|5|I have used this app for over a year and I think this is a really great and simple app!! :D Its your basic alarm clock app, very user friendly.
0812993845|5|Bought this book as part of my Mothers Day gift for my wife. She has other books from the same author and she raves about how she loves them. She's finished the book and she told me that she loved the story and that is all I need to know. Glad she loved it.
B001HN694K|5|What can I say? Its an age old classic story with a twist for all to see and enjoy. Johnny Depp is brillant and the CG work is outstanding.
B0012QE4Q2|5|All of the Phillipa Gregory books made into movies are excellent.  Of course, I read the book first, but found the movie to be very much like the book.  I will always buy Phillipa Gregory's books when they are available thru amazon.
B000JMKTLO|5|This author is gifted at weaving plot and subplot.  Even though the characters are not admirable the reader can't help but care.  Couldn't put it down.
B000002GVO|3|Hotel California is the Eagles most ambitious album and it's just okay.  They have a few great songs on the album but a lot of them a tepid ballads.  Now I know why everyone including your grandmother bought the Eagles Greatest Hits because they never put together a great album but they did write some great songs.
B008HJGPVO|5|I've tried so many touchscreen stylus, and this is the best so far.
B007X4ECLY|2|Basically I bought it because I thought a modern action movie is always good and the people complaining about it were just being critics, well I was wrong. It was so bad, now i'm not one to complain about a bad story but it was terrible, and the jokes were not the only thing that was cheap, in the beginning there was a car chase seen were this car flips and it was all animated, badly, like I play racing games with better animations. Its been a long time since I have ignored bad reviews and bought a movie anyway and it really did turn out to be that bad, but here I am. Not all movies with bad reviews are bad, but this one is a solid 2/5.
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is a fun game and lots of my friends like it too. You could say it is addictive. LOL
0143057812|5|Not only is it an incredible mystery that won't let you put it down, but the historical details of Spain keeping you on your feet at every twist and turn of the storyline.  Can't recommend this book enough for historical fiction fans and mystery lovers.
B009AOFNU4|1|I probably should have read more about this remote before I bought it but not only is it not compatible with terraria on my iPhone, as of the most recent iOS update it's not compatible with my phone.  At all.
B0000009SY|5|Give thanks to all who make the yellow snow - The Zappa Family Trust has finally regained control of Frank's catalog and ALL 60 FZ albums will once again be available at realistic prices before the end of the year.<br /><br />First 12 albums to be released July 31 - followed by 12 more/month for the next 5 months.<br /><br />The days of seeing insane prices on Zappa CDs is soon to be ended !!!
1594633665|4|Hard to put down enjoyed the characters
B001FBIPF0|5|It does have a crack on the cover, but I took a leap and bought a used cd...I'm lucky<br />it even worked! Listen to it everyday driving to work!
B008NR90HQ|2|I know in this day and age the &#34;F&#34; word is used in daily conversations for many uneducated folks, however its still shocking to hear in this house !<br />A warning would have been nice and I would not have wasted my money !!!<br />Its a sad tribute to a great guitar player, sorry they thought it was O.K. to leave that in.
B000002I27|5|I'm a big fan of the doors!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|It cleared up a lot of issues and questions for me. One of the best books I've read on this topic.
B00BI745AA|4|I thought maybe, the movie could have used a little less singing, which would have shortened the length of the movie.<br /> But otherwise very good movie.
B00MIA0KGY|5|A nice Streisand CD.
B00DWZHTOU|4|I bought it and the movie shows great, but the &#34;special features&#34; menu was missing on the disc which led me to question if it really was authentic. It is authentic but I guess some of the discs had different features on the menu screen. But this company quickly resolved my situation. They do have good products and really care about customer service.
B007AL48UK|1|didn't care for this one
0316228532|4|The problem (some) people are having with this work of fiction is that they don't seem to be able to separate J.K. Rowling from Harry Potter. This book would be well-received by any other author but Mrs. Rowling's fame stemming from the very popular children's series has impeded many a critical thought. Think outside of the walls of Hogwarts, people.
B000MNP2KI|3|This Bond movie was a big disappointment. I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5.  A lot of people complained about the Bond time line in this movie, but you got to realize that it's hard to work with since Bond has been around for like 50 years, so this is negligible.  Compared to the recent Bond movies with Brosnan, this movie was just not up to par.  Though there were plenty of action scenes, they were not at all explosive.  The car chase in the movie was extremely short, and also the end fight in the movie was not impressive.  Though Craig Daniel is by no means a bad Bond, he's not nearly as good as Brosnan, Connery, and Moore.  He doesn't have that charm/mojo that the other guys had when it comes to women.  Also, he seems a bit too buff for Bond.  I just hope that the next Bond movies will do a little more to accomodate today's crowd.
B00DPM7TIG|5|A lot going for this novel. Excellent writing, a memorable story without any cheap hooks. All told, this book is what a lot of bestsellers these days are not: literature.
B00ECU1A6C|4|I was a nice story, it could have easily been turned in to a season.  Now sure why they did not.  This is for kids, but everything happens quickly. ​
B00IKZX1ZI|2|I got it downloaded. Tried several times to get it going and it didn't work. So I said forget it. I thought it would be a great game. Oh well, I am so tired of these games that come across as it is suppose to.
B007SYWFRM|2|kept kicking me off and restarting the game. had to uninstall and reinstall repeatedly on my kindle fire. always took me back to the same level. none of my progress was saved. finally uninstalled for good.
0525478817|5|This is what we ordered and we got just that on time and in good condition. Served the purpose for us.
B009UX2YAC|1|This is a really boring game and it takes forever to download and it costs a lot to buy people
B00D7Z4GQY|5|love this book. read it in three days. I love reading a book that keeps me on my toes, and this book did that.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I am hopelessly addicted to this game so I guess that means it is a great game!  I find it fun and challenging but not so tough that you give up.
B0070Y46UY|4|This is not the typical type of books i would read but from the very beginning I was captured by the deep meaning  behind Pi's extraordinary journey. I loved understanding his thoughts on religion family and life. I enjoyed this bored so much.
B0042FZWC0|5|I thoroughly enjoyed Chris' book and can really appreciate his reasoning on strong individualism, minimalism and independence. What I like about Chris, is that he has built his lifestyle based on self sufficiency so that he can can pursue his dreams and have the freedom to help others. I really appreciate his view on minimalism - getting rid of unnecessary clutter and being free from consumerism and dependence on material things. Definitely an eye opener! It really shows that you can be successful without needing to become rich or materially wealthy. Life is not about wealth, but it's about having the financial freedom to make meaningful accomplishments - for Chris, it's being able to travel the world and to get involved in charitable giving plus helping others work towards a non-conformist lifestyle.<br /><br />We don't need to depend on external sources (i.e. an employer) or gain the approval of others based on following the social norms on how to live or gain an education. I strongly agree that a University degree is not the be all and end all. Ofcourse, it has its place but it should be viewed as an a necessary tool for a specific profession i.e. to become a doctor, lawyer or accountant. To be a doctor or do anything medical requires a degree and I personally would want to be seen by a doctor who has such credentials! But what Chris is trying to say, is that not everyone needs to box themselves into thinking they need a degree in order to be successful. Nor do they need to follow the expected path of 'job security' by being dependent on  employer/s, moving up the corporate ladder and then retiring aged 60+. We all know that such a 'secure' path is not even realistic based on economic instability and the unsure job market.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your viewpoint, experience and life story, Chris. It's great to see people like you getting your voice out there. It gives us other non-conformists hope that we can get out of the rut we are currently stuck in.
0385341008|5|The entire book is written in the form of letters the characters write to each other. Brilliant! Very engrossing and when's the last time you read a good book with a happy ending?? I highly recommend this book.
B00AOCLWF6|3|Its almost like a blast from the past, Its not only highly futuristic its also old school. Kixkin it old skoo just how I  prefer
B00DNO3DS6|5|emotional
B00CRMYN84|5|Fun can u find apple mortgage cake.
B0020BUWX2|4|Very good book I have to buy and read the the next book.
078401213X|5|What should a movie be?  A (insert one) funny, dramatic, action packed, exotic, futuristic, fantastical slice of life, a recording of what everyone already knows?  Or should it be something that is totally beyond viewer expectation, literally and visually and sonicly?  I'll always vote for the latter.  In fact this film reminds me of the '50s New York improv school of film.  The Cassavetes, the Poitier, the b&amp;w, the hand held street shots, the minimalist lighting and sound.  A more arty film-noir.  <br />A perfect stage for the deep thinker looking to unhide a secret of the universe.  A math-computer wiz dealing with problems on both sides of reality.  In spite of the hokey math and computer stuff, I found the story and acting riveting and inspiring.
B004IOVGW0|5|poignant.  real life. timeless.  will watch again......and again. genuine, sweet.  thanks.  Kim Novak was very young and played with incredible believability.  William Holden...well, one of my favorites since I was a kid and have followed him through the years...I always see something new I may have missed before on previous viewings..  I never get tired of it.
B00555X8OA|4|This book might the &#34;most enlightening book of the year&#34; for me. It solves many doubts I hold since childhood.
B00J8CGU64|5|Even though the movie is 3 hrs long, it really didn't feel like it. Think 'Scarface' meets 'Good Fellas', but in the financial world. Both the wife and I really enjoyed it.
B00BRUPICM|5|I loved this book. Very good. I am eagerly awaiting Mr Lematries next translation. This is dark action packed powerhouse of a book. 5 stars
B000JLSM00|5|Not my favorite John Wayne/John Ford western, but visually (at least, as far as fine detail and wide scenery goes), this is unbeatable. Fantastic level of image detail due to excellent transfer and restoration of the large Vistavision film image. One can argue with the color choices in this transfer, but as far as focus even on distant objects, this is the one to beat. After the ho-hum looking titles, you will suddenly drop your jaw when the first shot comes up and the cabin door is open to reveal the breathtaking live action in the desert. The film that will make you glad you are into watching movies in High Definition.
B002GYI9C4|5|Brandon Sanderson never disappoints, with his awesome imagination and powerful storytelling Sanderson brings his unique worlds to life.  I finished this book wanting more!
B00NGYBMOK|5|I bought this Maps for Kindle from Amazon.com and I LOVE it. I'm the kind of person who always gets lost with those MapQuest searches; not any more. Great App!
B00479SVBU|5|I got this for Christmas and it works great.  It has a strong signal that plays over the radio with no interference. It seems really sturdy too.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good quality mp3 transmitter.
B003JTHXOK|5|It is definitely a must read! It was hard to put down. It brought tears to my eyes and it gave me chills. You will not be disappointed :)
B007HU4FZ2|5|This is, without a doubt, one of the most impactful movies that I have ever seen. A movie not to be enjoyed, but experienced. Trust me when I say that it's an experience that could very well have life-changing effects for it's viewers. A
B004SD5GZ4|5|Because they are continually updating and making it better. Have never had any problems with this great and easy to use product.
B002TYZKIM|5|What a way to celebrate the music and dancing of Michael Jackson.  This DVD is a must have to keep his legacy living and pass on his music to generations.  The movie is unbelievably wonderful and a little sad knowing that this is the last you will ever see of the \\"King of Pop\\"
0316055441|3|Beautifully written. The words used were to me done as an art form. The story was okay and  it seemed to jump unlikely from story plot to story plot with no real rhyme or reason. Not much to say about the characters relationship with his mother, though sweetly described in the beginning snippets, there wasn't much to hold onto throughout the story. It was based more as a story of friendship and trust, but I was not emotionally stirred.
B00364K6YW|5|Colin Firth is perfection as a portrayal of smoldering sexuality. Jennifer Ehle is nearly as good as a cool, cerebral but emotionally available heroine.  The father, Mr.Bennet, is a delicious melding of humor and sarcasm.  I do have two quibbles.  Mrs. Bennet, the heroine's mother, is aptly done, but her shrillness becomes wearing early in the story.  I would have preferred less volume and more subtlety in this character. Secondly, Susannah Harker, whom I know from other productions to be capable of a powerful performance, is strangely vapid in her portrayal of the eldest Bennet daughter. Being pretty and smiling a lot is simply not enough, and is in sharp contrast to the well delineated characterizations delivered by most of the cast. However, on balance this production is excellent, and in an imperfect world really is about as good as it gets.
B00BMKH5NW|5|This book was pretty fantastic and leaves me wanting more! My curiosity wants to know what happens next. I feel as if there could be a sequel to this book and similarly amazing!!
0887307280|2|Main point of this book:<br />You should set up your business as a group of processes that anyone can do.  You can hire employees to follow the processes you've set up, and you don't need to be there all the time.  If you don't do this, the author argues you \\"own a job,\\" not a business.  The author uses McDonalds as his idealized example (and he argues that everyone should use McDonalds as a model for their business.\\")<br /><br />A secondary point:<br />You should learn about your customers, and market the customer experience to them rather than just your product.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />These two suggestions would be worth reading if the rest of the book wasn't so grating.  But the author does a few things that I found very annoying.<br /><br />First Annoyance: he makes many claims without any evidence.  For example, he states that any business that doesn't grow will \\"suffocate.\\"  This is inconsistent with casual observation, where I see many successful business with 1 or 2 employees.<br /><br />Second Annoyance: Instead of simply telling the reader what we need to know, the book is structured as a rambling dialog between the author and a frazzled pie-shop owner.  To get the content, you will sift through dialogs about the pie shop owner's relationship to her aunt, how stressed out she is, etc.  There's also an autobiographical chapter late in the book that seems totally out of place.  If you want to read about the author's romantic history and some trips he took while he was young, here is your chance!  Otherwise, skip this chapter.<br /><br />Third: The writing style is condescending.  Part of this is because the pie-shop owner in the book is always on the verge of tears, and the author coddles her.  If you just want the ideas and don't need to read him coddle her, this is grating.<br /><br />Finally: If your business is inherently scalable (eg a web based software business) some of the advice in this book will be less valuable to you.
B008NMT684|5|got it for my mom's new Kindle for my grandson.  easy to use, easy to install and he's going to love it!!
B00018TI6I|5|This is true rock and roll. I have never given these guys a chance as they were over played. Now that I got it a few years later, I am very impressed. Thanks for bringing a great sound back.
B00J8CG6KE|4|Excellent performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill. Definitely Oscar worthy contender. Very nostalgic if you grew up in the 60's.
B00BAXFECK|3|Goldfinch was interesting enough.
B00913DPW2|4|This is not an easy game. It's good and is a lot of work. There's constant back and forth throughout the game. You search for items and place them where they belong. And collect items which one contains hints, which will have a link to the walkthrough. There are minigames that you can skip. This game is not for children. It's difficult and eerie. It took me a couple of weeks to complete. It's worth the price.
0446573027|5|Hard to put down, probably because the audio book I read with it was so good.  I did get slightly soured when I thought the plot was going awry, but then it turned out I was wrong.  Just a great read from beginning to end.  Sorry to have finished it.  Do not know if Puller is a character in any other of Baldacci's books but he should be.  His tenacity is a great strength, as is his humanity and compassion, especially exhibited in his treatment of his father and Louisa.  Unfortunately a lot of people died in order to bring the truth to light.  Even the small characters were drawn exceptionally well.  Lots of human interest along with an intricate mystery.<br /><br />Because Amazon won't let me review the audio CD also, I guess I will have to do it here.  Do not, I repeat, do not get the abridged version.  The full-length version is quite simply superb.  A man and a woman, altering their voices slightly as each character dictates, the man being slightly better at this.  And there were a lot of characters.  The CD contains gun shots, explosions, ominous music, sound effects.  I loved it, like listening to an old-time radio show.  Just made the book come alive.  Do read them together if you can.
B00K0X1PYM|1|Professional ..and swarmy!! A copy that brings nothing new ,why listen to their Musak when the original is still easily available ? This \\"tribute\\" thing is a great thing if you do it on you tube,but this is just below standard.Granted ,J.J.CALE songs  probably cannot  be reworked without some innate originality,who could ever redo BO DIDDLEY?Like him,Cale hit on a super rythm, ,forever fine,but these guys here are just asleep.Still ,thanks to the ol' wrangler of songs ,Willy Nelson,there is a hint of what might be done when the hi-fives and tributing is done.Willy is old and young,the other guys here are just uninspired  and happy to coast.
B00DWVOPHI|1|What ?!  ANOTHER Version of Tommy?!<br /><br />In the day the Who was one of this reviewer's favorite bands. And Tommy is a great composition by any standard. But p-leeease, how many versions and shameless repackagings of Tommy can the music public tolerate? Consider:<br /><br /> In 1969 the Who released the original two-LP rock opera.<br /><br /> In 1970 the Who released an EP featuring selections from Tommy.<br /><br /> In 1970 the Who released an orchestral version of Tommy with London Symphony Orchestra and a bevy of rock stars.<br /><br /> In 1975 Ken Russell directed the movie Tommy.<br /><br /> In 1975 the soundtrack LP from the movie was released.<br /><br /> In 1990 Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a 24 K gold CD of Tommy.<br /><br /> In 1993 the Who remastered Tommy and released it on cassette.<br /><br /> In 1996 the Who brought Tommy to the Broadway stage. An LP of course was released afterwards.<br /><br /> In 1996 the Who released a remastered version of Tommy.<br /><br /> In 2004 the Who released a Deluxe version of Tommy.<br /><br /> In 2007 the Who released the Deluxe version of  Tommy in SACD.<br /><br /> In 2013 the Who released Tommy 2013 Deluxe, with songs substantially similar to and containing the same songs and alternative versions as the previous Deluxe version(s).<br /><br /> Now there is ... (drum roll) ... the Super Deluxe Tommy, three CDs with a Blue Ray DVD.<br /><br />Enough already!! What is the point ??<br /><br />Tommy is a masterful composition and will withstand the test of time  -- and will continue to do so, or at least as long as Pete Townshend is alive to re-market Tommy in yet another version. The continual re-packaging of Tommy serves only to diminish the value of this great musical piece. True, between 1975 and 1996 the Who did not re-released Tommy. During that time period Townshend could have, but didn't, release a disco version of Tommy. We must all thank him for that.<br /><br />Even with all the extras in this combo this release reeks of rank consumerism. This release deserves one star not because it is a bad release or a bad musical piece but because there appears to be no other legitimate purpose to this new release other than to further gouge more money from consumers.this release reeks of rank consumerism.

0684874350|4|Frank McCourt's book Angela's Ashes was a MEMOIR. It was intended to be a truthful and vivid account of his REAL life. I thought it was wonderful, and I learned a lot about what life was like for indigent families in Ireland. Yes, the scenes were graphic and tragedies seemed endless, but it  was VERY well-written. I think a lot of people didn't like the book, either  because they were expecting a delicate, sugar-coated tale of his childhood  or simply because the story forced them to evaluate how many things they  took for granted in their own childhood. Guilt can be a terrible  thing...Also, how can anyone say that there was too much sadness?  This is  an ACTUAL account of someone's life. I applaud Mr. McCourt at having shared  his pain with his readers. For all of those who did not like this book,  next time, pick up one of those predictable romance novels from the grocery  store; leave the emotional truths and real-life stories to the rest of us.
B00MHT49TK|5|Definitely worth the buck! I collect Miyazaki films. This is one of the many that I treasure. My husband and I are both fascinated by the way Miyazaki fictionalized Mr. Horikoshi's life.
B0007PAMR4|3|I clearly remember watching this version of the film on WPIX back in 1987, and indeed memories are fond... for a while at last. On the positive side of things, this is the best audio and image quality DUNE has been available since its theatrical release, and stands proud when compared with the letterboxed laserdisc version or the previous DVD transfer. Also, it's a pleasure to watch some of the magic behind scenes, get some extra flavor from the deleted scenes and the picture galleries. However, this release falls behind as it's basically the same 1987 TV version that I clearly remember. Not a single change, but the sound and image improvement. The bonus are very limited, and lacking in scope, running in less than 40 minutes, something sad for a film with such legendary fame. There's no director's commentary, interview or anything related with David Lynch for a good reason: he disowned the TV version, and I'm sure that he never looked back into the DUNE universe. If there's a 4 hours version sitting somewhere, I'm sure we'll never see it, precisely because of this bad blood between the producer and the director. My advise is to buy it, so you can enjoy the theatrical version with bells and whistles. Regarding the badly cut and rough TV (extended) version, just look at it thinking on what it could have been, and never was.
B001BKVWYG|5|Amazing, practically unknown songwriter!
B007XKEY6Q|5|I like it because you draw something that explains the real word.
B00GD9F59S|5|I really enjoyed all the books to this series and was sad to see it end... Well written and look for reading more books from the writer.
B00000IPAX|3|Blink 182 has made a Cd worth play on the radio a couple times, not every day on the radio and mtv.  There are MUCH better bands out there.  I can't stand people who just listen to mtv music. Although blink 182 is not quite  like the fabrications of the Boy bands, there are better bands out there  like THE HIPPOS.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I Would give its a six star, very good game enjoy its every day. I wish every one would play this game my family love it. My grandchildren said its a boom
B000QRIGLC|5|We saw the movie and well... it really is a must read kind of book. It had to be the hardest time in his family's lives not knowing if he  was ok.
0783233477|5|This remake of the original, \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\", is impeccable in its attention to the flow of the story. All the actors played their part perfect. Claire Forlani is gorgeous in her innocence. Brad Pitt stunningly plays the part of Death. Anthony Hopkins brilliant as the chosen one. Its 3 hour length allows the fullness of the story to unfold.  I highly recommend watching it.
B00XOX9QCS|4|Great effects and characters. The whole movie is a blast even if you don't have any backstory to go off of.
B0063IH60K|5|Great game for passing some time.  Lots of different choices of set up and easy to use.  Fun for all ages.
B00E8KLWB4|3|not good or bad
B00915G6SU|5|Favorite TV show. Know characters and their histories.  I'm hooked on show. I have all 8 seasons and hope to add season 9
080241270X|5|I love practical books like this; I read it in just a couple afternoons.<br />I will begin by saying that although I had heard glowing reports of ''the 5 love languages'', I hadn't really thought much on the subject and I certainly had never read any of Mr. Chapman's books prior to this year! This is my second book from Gary Chapman and I am so impressed and excited.<br /><br />Simple Ideas, Lasting Love<br /><br />Between busy schedules and long days, expressing love can fall by the wayside. We forget to compliment, to give gifts &#34;just because,&#34; to linger in our embrace. The things that say &#34;I love you&#34; seem to either not get said or not get through. This is a book about saying it-and hearing it-clearly. No gimmicks. No psychoanalyzing. Just learning to express love in your spouse's language.<br /><br />With over 10 million copies sold, The 5 Love Languages® has transformed countless relationships. Its ideas are simple and conveyed with clarity and humor, making this book as practical as it is personable. You'll be inspired by real-life stories and Dr. Gary Chapman's commonsense yet perceptive insights on relationships. Reading this book feels like taking a walk with a wise friend. Applying it will change your relationship forever-starting today.<br /><br />  So popular is the ''love languages'' theory and original book by Gary D. Chapman that the publisher has presented yet another edition of the same helpful and wise text! Absolutely everyone can benefit from the advice in this book. Of course this version is specifically targeted towards married couples. However, as with many books this one can be beneficial for anyone, married or unmarried. If we desire actual working relationships with people, we must know how to love them. I appreciated how this book would be appropriate not only for Christians, but for non-believers as well. I know that the foundational importance is salvation and the state of the soul. But I love how practical the author isin explaining how to understand how to love each human being around us. Although it would be best if the reader is saved, the practical information contained in the chapters of this book should benefit every living being created in the image of God!<br />Such a variety of relationships is covered in this paperback book. I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone.<br />The author is considerate in including a variety of characters and personalities in this book. It also covers the ''invention'' of the 5 love languages and plenty of real-life examples of couples who worked through their problems using this technique.<br /><br />It's hard to write a review about a book which is full of good and helpful truths! All I can say is, read it and let it change your relationships! As an addition to seeking Christ and dwelling in His word of course, this method, combined with the wonderful book Equipped to Love by Norm Wakefield and the useful brain typing method can change lives, save marriages and salvage many relationships!
B000L53D4O|5|good product
B0054JZC6E|5|I got this game and its awesome you don't need to buy coins to unlock games, when you win game's you can win coins
0440243688|4|Always like Reacher book and this was no exception.
B007QXWV1U|1|Does not work on Apple products, Android only.
B00F1W1SQW|5|This DVD is not a disappointment. A lot of people freaked out when Mike Portnoy (The FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE BAND) quit in 2010 and left a huge void to fill. Most fans saw the try-out videos and therefore know how that all went. Mike Mangini was the only possible choice and this DVD is the proof. The man is amazing! you have watch closely to get how fast he's able to move his hands and feet. Portnoy ain't no slouch but &#34;Holy-Soup&#34; this guy isn't quite human. A &#34;one-handed&#34; drum roll is gonna leave the viewer with that impression. The whole video is amazing. Great camera work even-balanced sound and along standing Dream Theater tradition of constantly pushing the envelope makes this a damn great DVD.  A must have for any true Prog fan and for damn sure a must have for Dream Theater fans.
B000QRIGLC|5|The media can sleep peacefully in their beds at night because rough men like Marcus Luttrell stand ready to do violence on their behalf; to defend the very freedom they subvert to smear our troops and aid the enemy.
B00000DWHG|4|A flawed album...but some good music. Townshend was banging his head against the wall for material while Keith Moon was out of control. Pete struggled to keep Moonie up to speed during the recording sessions which did not go smoothly.<br /><br />Still, a must have for who fans.
0802407692|5|This is an incredible book. My husband and I got married and shortly after he went off for deployment, we read this book together (even over 7,000 miles apart) and even though we were very close, this brought us closer together. It's amazing how much you can learn not only about your partner but about yourself. I recommend this book to all military spouses, even spouses who have veteran s/o's. It amazing.
1451636016|5|Motivated me to get back into daily meditation.  I will look into spiritual guides and retreats using the sound guidance he provides.  I have been avoiding doing this because of the large degree of sociopaths and well meaning idiots in this field.
B0013D8LOU|5|My g/f is a huge Johnny Depp Fan and I am a huge Tim Burton fan. This movie is great for all who love horror and musicals. Love the DVD with all the extra even the history of the story of Sweeny Todd.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love it I had to get rid of the horses live in rural area. These graphics are totally amazing. Someday I hope to make a game like this.

B007ZGBZHE|1|Thoroughly enjoyed all the previous Pendergast books and waited eagerly for this final in a ttrilogy about Pendergast's wife. What a disappointment!<br />The FBI shouldn't even pay this fallen hero $1 per year. Lacking in moral character Pendergast and this series should retire to the old plantation never to be heard from again. The only redeeming value of the book is that it laid to rest some mysterious issues in previous books.
0060935464|5|The great American classic, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, is a heart-warming and insightful re-telling of one spunky, curious girl growing up in the racially-divided and old-fashioned South. The main character, Scout, was constantly reprimanded by her relatives, for being too \\"unladylike.\\" She breaks through these gender stereotypes by refusing to adhere to this expected persona of a Southern Belle. Ever her brother and friend engage in sexist jokes and banter, and exclude her from certain activities because of her gender. Despite her dealing with the constant insults to her person, Scout blossoms into an upstanding and determined woman, partially because of her father Atticus's moral teachings throughout her development.                This book is considered a classic for a reason. Not only does it contain beautiful writing and meaningful morals, but it also has an entertaining plot. The book appeals to twelve-year olds and forty year olds alike, with a sweet and humorous story. All different kinds of people, from the more \\"involved\\" Stephanie Crawford's to the sassy and opinionated Calpurnias, can enjoy this wonderful tale of growing up, learning new things, and breaking boundaries that has entertained a nation for over forty years.     by ava, jenny w, lizzy, and rosalie.

B00AQ3K8IU|5|Excellent! I'm stingy with 5 star ratings.  This is absolutely worth all 5 and more.  Heart-wrenching, heart-warming, life-affirming, bold, insightful.  Stop reading the reviews and just buy the book already!!
B0045HCIZY|2|I say the current one in the movie theater and thought I would see the beginning movie.  It was so bad I did not watch the next one.
B00005JOFQ|5|Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.     I've read a lot of the other reviews and it seems that everyone has a different take on Jack and Ennis's relationship. But this is how I see it:  Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with eachother. Lust doesn't last 20 years and the fact that they did go on to have so-called \\"normal\\" relationships with the women they married was not because they were bisexual but because they were doing what they thought they \\"had\\" to do. They tried hard to deny who they really were inside and married women, had families, then girlfriends but this was all part of the social pressure they felt to be \\"normal\\". Jack had more guts than Ennis did and was desperate to have a life with him because he needed him and loved him so badly, but Ennis was too uncomfortable with his love for Jack, was too embarrassed by it and couldn't have followed his heart because he was too consumed with the murder of the gay man he'd witnessed as a child. It isn't until the end, when Jack is gone, that Ennis comes to the realization that he let the love of his life slip through his hands. His daughter has found love and is getting married, Alma has remarried and Ennis finds himself alone with nothing to love or hang onto because he let his fears and insecurities about who he was come before his true love for Jack. The lesson is a hard one but the message is simple: No matter who you are or who you love, don't let anyone tell you who you should be. If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish. Never, never, never deny your heart.
B0001XAPY2|5|From a fan and student of Miyazaki-san: <br />\\"Porco Rosso\\" is the master's most autobiographical work, for once he was not trying to impart any moral or environmental lessons to children or young girls or the Japanese society, as most of his other works did---but a heartfelt fantasy projection of himself (being an independent agent neither belonging to your typical Japanese Anime Industry or the Hollywood/Disney American Culture juggernaut, as symbolized by the brash American Pilot-Fighter, Curtis). <br />It's also a celebration of his fellow frustrated romantic and idealistic adults (many tired Japanese salary men and animators) who have not completely surrendered their youthful dreams to the MAN/military industry.  <br />Set in Post WWI Europe, where Fascism was on the rise, the Continental world it captured was a last breath of fantastic and natural freedom before a long darkness set in... <br />The genius stroke here is by turning the protagonist into a PIG, a whimsical yet literal mockery on those old-fashioned/outdated all-male/brotherhood chauvinist melodramatic adventure genre it so lovingly appropriates, and a gentle dig on \\"mankind\\" in general, all in good and slightly surreal fun.<BR>In this story, Miyazaki made fun (instead of preaching to) of his society, himself and his prominent role in it.  <br />Yet, behind all the cartoony surface lies the touching elegiac sadness of a lost past and a yearning hope (placed esp. on a young female) for a better future, straight from Miyazaki-san's cynical/sentimental heart.  <br />Presented as a light-hearted lark only makes its immersing nostalgia and lyricism all the more spontaneously enchanting<BR>and unexpectedly affecting. A magical paradox of his great art. <br />\\"Porco Rosso\\" is the \\"Casablanca\\" of cartoons with a touch of Roald Dahl, and the most under-rated and overlooked of Miyazaki's fabulous work.

B000002KOJ|4|Joni's second album Clouds is a lovely introspective and quiet album. All the songs feature only Joni and her guitar with here and there some other instruments to enhance the mood. The best things about the album are the beautiful guitar tunings Joni uses and the lyrics who are passionate and full of feeling. Her voice is still pure here and she sings mostly in her soprano range. Joni's best known song Both Sides, Now is featured on this record and I cannot express how much that song means to me. If you're a casual fan and want to try some of her lesser known work, this is a nice addition to your collection.
B009A9EPLM|5|I don't have any of the musical sophistication of some of the expert reviewers here.  I don't have clear defined standards nor the ability to compare one soundtrack from another and draw conclusions about whether an artist has made some fundamental statement or whatever.  I just like what I can feel.  This is one of the finest soundtracks I've ever heard and what the music conveys to me is a sense of the melancholy and the inner strength that was so much a part of Mr. Lincoln.  I also enjoyed the added dimension of \\"Getting Out the Vote\\" and the inspiration of \\"Call the Muster and the Battle Cry of Freedom\\".<br /><br />All in all this is some of the very best music I have in my collection. Sonically, the recording does this soundtrack justice with a clear and well-defined soundstage that, at least with my equipment, puts me about in the 3 or 4th row of a concert hall.  The sound isn't harsh or immersive.  The volume of this recording is just about right for this kind of music.<br /><br />As the 5 stars I gave this recording indicate, I highly recommend this soundtrack.  Frankly, I think John Williams is a national treasure.
B00BMT9SQA|4|I was surprised how good this movie was. The movie takes a bit to warm up but the one-liners are pretty funny. It's a goofy funny, light hearted and decent storyline. I would recommend!

Yet again, the greedy app monsters would rather have you pay astronomical amounts of money to play their phone game instead of just charging a price up front to just buy the game with all of the upgrades & advances already  in it like other more famous companies such as EA Sports, Square Soft,  Sony, Microsoft, you know. . .The makers of games we pay one price for every day!

B004EPYZP8|5|Great movie.....
0679720200|5|I have read this book twice, so far.  I loved it.  Camus has created a character who's behavior is so antisocial that his actions, to us, seem almost incomprehensable.  One cannot help but be struck be the completely relative way the Meursaut relates to the world.  With simple, straight forward narative, Camus sends his message straight to the heart of society.  I loved this book and i recommend it to any one.  Also, if you liked The Stranger, check out Native Son, by Richard Wright, another existentially driven novel which is very good.
B00J2VSS0C|4|OK GAME BUT HARD TO FIND OBJECTS

0385504209|5|I was recommended &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by a friend of mine who said that in spite of its religious subject, it was a great read and a great thriller/mystery. She was absolutely right.<br />If you like thrillers but aren't into alternative religious studies, you will still like this book. &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; is so strong as an adventure story, you don't have to be into any of the main characters' favorite subjects to enjoy it.<br />It does help, however, to be interested by the mental twists and turns of the conspiracy theories, obscure history and anti-establishment viewpoints expressed here. It also helps to have a good vocabulary or a good dictionary -- the main characters are all academics, and they speak and think as such.<br />In a nutshell, this book is a great ride for the nerdier crowd, but still plenty adventurous enough for the regular thriller reader to stay tuned in.
B000002UCN|4|Yes, it was insulting that the record company felt it had to pad out a George `Best of' with Beatles numbers by George. Still, that move does serve to remind us that George WAS a Beatle and remained quite capable of writing and performing Beatlesworthy material, at least sporadically, long past the split. And so it was for the other three as well.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game. Its awesome you can take care of horses. You can ride the horse. Teach the horse.
B00DPM7TIG|3|I think the author put a lot into the story, and many parts were very descriptive and interesting. However, I felt there was an over use of metaphors and was hoping for an upbeat happy ending. Felt like the end just kind of hung there with no final conclusion with the characters.<br /><br />Also, I was looking for more tension and plot, but maybe this wasn't the kind of book for me. Was some good ratings on it, therefore, thought I'd check it out. This may of been more of a female read to be truthful.<br /><br />Book was unique though in the way the author described various scenes etc. Hope I'm not being too harsh, but I was looking for more suspense.

B00NQKWAIQ|5|I was somewhat dismissive when I heard that the album would be largely instrumental but the more I thought about it, the more keenly I anticipated its release.  Upon first hearing the album, my lukewarm initial response quickly evaporated and I can comfortably say that this is an excellent Pink Floyd record.    The true test of a good instrumental lies in its ability to stir emotion and convey meaning without words. This album does just that if experienced the way it was intended: in its entirety.  Each side with its seamless transition of tracks is like a one lengthy piece with the shorter tracks supplementing and supporting the overall architecture of the piece.  The sequencing and transition of the individual pieces is nothing short of brilliant. It's similar to though not quite the same as side B of Abbey Road.  So in reality there are 4 songs in the album (actually 5 because Louder than Words can easily stand on its own).  If listened to from beginning to end on a CD (or via gapless playback if you have the MP3), the experience is revelatory, transforming and magical.  There's something deeply profound that stays with you, like the sweet smell of a great sorrow that lies over the land.  The occasional soft sampling of the old Pink Floyd sound adds to the overall feel of the album and heightens its stature as Pink Floyd's swan song.  And now, the words that come to mind when describing the record are: haunting, exquisite and return to form.    David's guitar playing is absolutely stunning and Nick's drumming, similar to his style in Wish You Were Here, is the perfect accompaniment.  Against the backdrop of Rick's beautiful piano keyboards, it sounds like classic Pink Floyd.  But ultimately, it's Gilmour's guitar that carries the album to a region of sonic bliss, high above the clouds...    If I had to pick favorite moments it would be \\"It's What We Do\\", \\"Sum\\", \\"Anisina\\", \\"Unsung\\", \\"Talkin' Hawkin\\", \\"Allons-Y / Autumn 68\\" medley and \\"Louder than Words\\".

And thank you for being polite when I met you at a book signing in a Philadelphia Barnes & Noble and proceeded to babble at you about toxoplasmosis out of star-struck nervousness.
0807014273|5|Most people have suffered to some degree, either in the past or they will most likely experience something undesirable in the future. A book like this could literally be a life-safer and improve your life for absolute better.     I cannot believe it took so many years before I discovered such an fantastic book regarding self-improvement and how to overcome tragic events in such a helpful way like presented in the book.

1594488916|4|Allison Hoover Bartlett's The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is a quick, readable look at the world of book collection. She dips into the history of bibliomania and provides vignettes of other characters, but mostly the book is an account of two men and the author's experiences in getting to know them. Ken Sanders is the owner of a rare book store in Salt Lake City who served for six years as the security chair of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association. He embraced that role enthusiastically, improved methods for alerting members of the organization to recent thefts during his tenure, and doggedly pursued one particular repeat offender. John Charles Gilkey, like other bibliomaniacs, is obsessed with adding to his collection of rare books, but in his case the books have tended to come free of charge, courtesy of the sorry souls who were unlucky enough to have once handed over their credit cards to Gilkey when he worked at Saks Fifth Avenue. Gilkey methodically collected their numbers and identities and used the cards, months later, to fund hotel stays and book-buying junkets.<br /><br />Bartlett spent a lot of time interviewing both men, and while neither quite comes alive on the page, Gilkey emerges as an interestingly flawed human being, possessed of a curiously selective sense of morality. For him, stealing rare books is illegal, perhaps, but hardly immoral, a means of evening the score against an unfair world that has not made him rich enough to own priceless books without stealing them. His conscience about his misdeeds is clear. Bartlett spends some time with Gilkey's mother and sister as well--more exploration of this dysfunctional family would have made for a  more interesting book. Gilkey's mother, at least, seems to be thoroughly in denial about her son, whom she praises for his outstanding posture.<br /><br />I don't really get the allure of collecting myself--books or anything else. Like the author, I understand that books can carry secondary meanings as physical objects: a book may be loved because of its place in your or someone else's history. But I don't relate to books in the same way that collectors apparently do, desiring to possess particular copies, and so I approach this story as something of an outsider. Bartlett's book is not a hard-hitting investigative piece by any means, and it probably won't offer anything new to readers familiar with book-collecting from their own experience or from other treatments of the subject. But for the non-specialist it's a good light introduction to the topic and to the lives of the two very different men whom the author profiles.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelphysical objects: a book may be loved because of its place in your or someone else's history.

B00A9ET4MC|5|This is a well-written story with engaging characters. Many important and interesting social issuesare are woven into the story; one learns but never feels preached at.
B00063EMJ6|5|This is truly a Greatest Hits CD!! Perfect Neil Young collection!! Sounds Great!! Brings back lots of memories from the 60's and 70's with a couple of later songs included!! Mostly made up of his excellent early songs!!
0440236738|5|This book was wonderful. Coben's style of writing makes it seem so easy to write a book. The main character speaks to you in a conversational tone and often appologizies for the bad analogies and or cliches he's about to use. It's quite funny at times.<br />All the characters are interesting, especially Squares. You are brought deep into their world right away and are not let go of even after the story is over. Although the ending was satisfying, in my opinion, I wanted more. To me that is one sign of an excellent story. Oh and did I mention the character Squares? He's great.<br />Before this book I was laboring through other books, often not finishing them. I picked this book up from the library on Thursday night and finished Saturday night. It was so much fun to read.
B00DPM7RJW|5|Colleen Hoover does it again! This is a great story filled with so many emotions I can't even describe.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you fall in love with the characters :)
B000JMKTLO|2|Definately not a book I would recommend to a friend to read. I would never have purchased this book, but the book club I belong to chose this as our next reading material.
B0094K1MH2|5|I'm kind of biased here. Huge fan of Peter Jackson. Enjoyed Tintin as a child. So I had big expectations and they were met. Glad I finally saw this.
B00DTDKTCO|4|This book has had my attention non stop. If anyone interrupted me I was not happy!<br /><br />What remarkable people are in this book. I say people and not characters because this author Colleen Hoover breathed life into them and brought them alive so much so I could reach out and hug them.<br /><br />Its strange how our minds work, blocking out the things we need to forget to survive. Having someone strong around to keep you standing when you do remember.<br /><br />The justifying of Karen's involvement was very well handled. At one time I was calling her all sorts of names. I still can't say it was right or wrong, but perfectly understandable.<br /><br />Brilliant book. If you've not read it yet, you need to.<br /><br />I'm now off to read book 2

B00AIUUXHC|4|I absolutely love Hungry Shark Evolution, unfortunately I must grade 4 stars. The only problem is that HSE is not designed to work properly on smartphones. The shark is too difficult to control on such a small screen, and the game lags because it is too heavy. I have tried it on different smartphones and it's always the same, but when I play it on a tablet (e.g. iPad) the game usually works perfectly smooth. When this is the case I can play it for two straight hours! So if you're going to get this game, make sure you install in on a tablet.
B007J4T2G8|4|I was captivated by the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy. Despite the NY TImes description of it as \\"Mommy Porn\\", I found the erotic passages interesting enough but not particularly titillating, especially by volume three. It was Anastasia and Christian, the protagonists, who keep me glued to my iPad. They were skillfully drawn, engaging people about whom I cared. That skill is the key to attracting and maintaining a reader's interest and Ms. Davis has mastered it. Even though some of her literary devices seemed shop worn and over-used as the books progress (inner goddess etc.), I managed to overlook them in my quest to finish this modern fairy tale. The parallels to Twilight are obvious, but this series is very adult in terms of sexual candor. Still, by using first person voice of young Anastasia, the author manages to mitigate the purient parts, and make it all seem curiously innocent. Christian Grey the troubled, gorgeous billionaire is a hot alpha hero who most women would gladly take despite his kinky habits. The author allows us to understand and sympathize with Christian, rather than recoiling from his more bizarre tastes. I found myself rooting for these star-crossed lovers. You will too.
0307352145|5|I rarely come accross books that are so well written.  It's insightful and groundbreaking and important work.  I was kind of ho hum about it the first chapter or so but the book just builds and builds into a beautiful interlacing of ideas in a masterful way as you continue.<br /><br />This book just explains so much about people, and it is really about quite a bit more than the subject of the title.  It's very very good.
B00P596I8Y|5|Although a horror film, it is a poignant and incredibly accurate depiction of grief, sudden or out-of-order death and death denial. The film is beautiful and horrifying all at once.

B00A9X9VAI|4|...I had the ending figured about somewhere around the halfway mark. I even paused the movie and told the kids I was going to send them an email with the ending so they could see I was right. Sure enough, i was right on almost all points of the ending. It's not so much that the movie is predictable... I can't explain it. Overall, it's a good thriller and it was entertaining enough I figure it was worth the cost of buying it to watch. My adult children both loved the show. It is one you want to pay attention to or it can get a little confusing when they start moving back and forth through time. Other than that, it's a good suspense thriller with a lot of action.

Good movie though watch it. To continue resident evil movie series.

B004Q7CIFI|5|From the concept to the execution to characters you can root for and a desire to see how the story will ultimately turn out (doesn't disappoint), this may be the best thing King's written in years--maybe one of his best works. 11/22/63 doesn't fit into the horror genre King is known for, and most of his best work doesn't.<br /><br />This book has heart, and is written so well that it gives me hope that there is more greatness to come from an author whose best work came early in his career. I often don't like the way his books turn out, but this one satisfied in every way.

6304467540|5|I LOVE this movie.  I could watch it over and over again in one sitting!  It's highly addictive.  You cannot finish watching one and nort go on to two.  The way each movie ends leaves you wondering about the next.  I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves old Italian Godfather type movies.  The book is really good, also.

B00IRISI42|5|This novel started a bit slowly but I equate that with John Puller's personality.  He's an investigator and he things things out slowly and carefully.  The storyline proceeds with his &#34;personality.&#34;  With David Baldacci you really can't go wrong.

B006PHD0RW|5|This is one of my favorite games on my Kindle Fire. There are a lot of levels and they are all really fun! The levels are just hard enough to make them fun to play over and over. I especially like infinite mode!
B00COGXGNQ|4|Entertaining romantic movie with a bit of mystery.  It keeps you guessing as to why Katie (Hough) is on the run.  About 3/4 of the way through the movie, you finally find out and then the suspense begins.  It has an interesting and unexpected twist at the end.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|Good racing & more Stunts & more should give it a go..Fast cars
B00005JLXE|3|Theres nothing groundbreaking here. Too dark? Could have been alot darker if you ask me. What the heck happened to Bullseye? Why does he now look like the character from The Last Action Hero? Certain things just shouldnt be messed with. This just doesnt come close to spiderman and no where near the first Batman. Cant wait for the Hulk, that should be a good laughable cartoon.
B000M53GM2|5|This two hour plus 1995 film with Pierce Brosman, with lots of hair and humor and action, is delightful. A secret weapon is stolen by a rogue Soviet general and 007's mission is to retrieve it. The film starts with an episode in which 007 and 006 attack a USSR fascility to blow it up. They are sourrounded by Soviet soldiers; we see 006 shot; 007 escapes in a miraculous, indeed impossible manner when 007 chases and jumps aboard a plane.<br /><br />The film jumps nine years to a car race and sex. The film has its usual female characters with suggestive names. In this case it is Onatop, or is it on the top. She is a pilot. She is able to kill men during sex by squashing them with her legs in a scissor hold. She is working with the rogue Soviet general. She has a near or actual sexual orgasm when she kills people.<br /><br />Since fifteen years have passed since this film was made, we will see several actors in the film who later made it big on their own: one, for example, played a detective in a long running series, one a weird psychologist in a series, and one introduces Masterpiece Theatre, among other things.

0471381985|5|This is a very lucid, practical introduction to the principles of value investing. It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold.
B00821PCJS|5|Great show.  Just hate that you have to wait so long between seasons.  The first season was definitely the best, but all are interesting in their own right, with a crescendo to the next.  Ready for Season 4.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Love Downtown Abbey and so sorry to hear this will be the last season
B007A2O3FO|2|Having enjoyed the 1995 Jack Finney book, &#34;From Time To Time&#34; I figured that the movie might be a nice interesting time travel story. I was wrong. It could've been made that way... instead the director had the main character revert back to the past not by traveling through time, but through ghosts there in the house. I learned a long time ago that there was one eventuality as regards humans.... Ecclesiastes 3:19 puts it: &#34;as the one dies, so dies the other (animals and man); they all have but one spirit... all go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.&#34; Needless to say, I was disappointed. Time travel would've worked. To my estimation, this didn't.

0778321606|5|I picked this up as an \\"airport\\" read, expecting a bit of fluff. Instead, I was treated to a rich, deep, wonderful story worth savoring. By the half-way point, I couldn't put it down! I was surprised at how well the characters are drawn, and loved the interactions among them. I cried several times toward the end, from identifying with the characters. And after finishing, I wished it wasn't over - just because I was enjoying it so much. I'm really looking forward to the sequel _A Good Yarn_. <br /> <br />I don't often go out of my way to recommend books, but this one is worth it.
B00DMCV7K0|5|I couldn't put it down! Great book! Great historical fiction that really draws you in. I look forward to reading more of the authors work.

B0026P40NU|1|I cannot believe anyone who cared for the Pre-Raphaelites had anything to do with this production. After the first two episodes, I considered it passable, though I thought John Ruskin was treated shabbily. After that, it all went downhill. I finally threw up my hands and howled at the protrayals of William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones; it was evident that the script writer knew NOTHING about the two men, who were made to look like imbiciles, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum in matching purple waistcoats. William Morris was a true polymath: father of the arts and crafts movement, socialist, medievalist, calligraphist, printer, and early environmentalist, and to dismiss him, as this travesty does, as a loutish, stammering fool, is unforgivable.    Though some critics have praised the set design, no one has pointed out the ham-fisted attempts to reproduce some of the artists' paintings used in the production. You did not need a book to hand to see how wretched Rossetti's \\"Bocca Baciata\\" was rendered. And whilst on the subject -- why on earth would you have a script that went beyond the original PRB? Jane Morris was so striking as to be impossible to cast. Only a credulous fool could suspend disbelief long enough to credit that the actress playing the role could inspire the lust Rossetti feels when they first meet. She looks NOTHING like Jane Morris.    If anyone out there wants to know a little about Rossetti, Morris, Ruskin, and Burne-Jones, they ought to read:  Oswald Doughty's and Jan Marsh's biographies of Rossetti  Fiona MacCarthy's magisterial biography of William Morris  Tim Hilton's exhaustive biography of John Ruskin  Lady Burne-Jones's Memorials of her husband (and the forthcoming biography of Burne-Jones, by Fiona MacCarthy).    \\"Desperate Remedies\\" is a desperate, rubbish treatment of these four men, in particular.    Give this a miss.
B003YVCJQ0|5|The movie does well -  balancing action and human interest. One of my favourites.
1936891026|5|One of my favorite writing books EVER. Every now and then I reread it, and buy even more copies to give out. Steven was cruisin' with the muse when he wrote this one. You want to own it, in paperback even.
B004CLYKLI|5|OK. I read this from a different perspective. My predilection was coaching youth sports.<br /><br />So, I either learned or confirmed the following.<br /><br />The self-esteem focus is overrated and counter productive.<br />Fun is mastering a difficult skill.<br />Good repetitions with mentored feedback are essential to success.<br />If Bob Knight can't possibly coach your kid, your second choice should be Amy Chua.<br />Beware of orthodoxy, especially the secular strain.<br />This book is, yes, a memoir, but, too, a coach's handbook.<br />Woody Hayes is alive and well in the essence of Amy Chua.<br />Youth \\"travel\\" teams are to learning, as Obama is to political economy. If a good occurs, it is adventitious.<br />For the good of your progeny, choose depth in a single activity over breadth in many, at the earliest possible age.<br />The significant difference between John Wooden and Amy Chua is the decibel level.
B000FA675C|5|This work is an absolutely exciting, cleverly written cat-and-mouse chase which will run through your most deeply held convictions – one which continues to challenge today’s real institutions, or perhaps even support traditional beliefs, but certainly unsettling any status quo between man and faith and all the underlying pillars of everyday life.  THE DAVINCI CODE, therefore, easily remains one of the most excitingly written suspense novels – or creative historical codex – of our time.<br /><br />Nowadays, the general premise is widely known, and in whichever camp one’s convictions may lay there is surely an abundance of artistic entertainment here.  Beyond the last page, however, is where the tale really begins; the struggle within oneself.<br /><br />Absent blind allegiance, the narrative encourages you to read this work in different contexts, i.e., other, more studious works on which it is based.  Take, for example, &#34;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&#34; (Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln), whose groundbreaking study in 1982 upset the status quo in their time; then, perhaps, consider the Nag Hammadi scriptures, discovered in 1945, or the known record concerning the Council of Nicea (AD 325) and discover the reasons of the &#34;missing books&#34; of the Bible.  These are but a few, but all equal building blocks which may even be found hidden within the U.S. Declaration of Independence.<br /><br />In any case, this book will capture your attention with much detail, certainly test all you may have been taught, and in a more profound way than any Hollywood movie has dared to produce - even its own namesake.<br /><br />Read the book for yourself, free and independent of other rigid views, and you will enjoy the ride….
B007L3BMGA|1|JUST THAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OTHERS SEX HABITS THE WRITING IS SO BAD AND BORING  I JUST SKIPPED  MOST OF IT AND DIDNT THINK THE SEX WAS WRITTEN WELL AT ALL<br />I AM SO PLEASED I DOWN LOADED AT A REASONABLE PRICE ON MY KINDLE
1442346949|3|I do love Apple, however, among biographies, this is overwhelmingly written as nothing more than another Apple fan product, from end to end. Doubtful it will stand the test of time for others.
0060775858|5|I have three children 8,3 and 2. From the oldest to the youngest this is one of our all time favorites. Threre is a peaceful rhythm to this book that just sets the tone for dozing off to sleep. At the end when the little rabbit is saying goodnight to everything we continue by saying goodnight to one another. I just ordered another one for my 4 year old niece. We actually read it so much we all know it by heart. I'll be buying this book for my grandkids many years from now.
B003NRYMZQ|4|Torchwood is just the right combination of drama, comedy, monsters, and mystery.  The many layers of each character are peeled back gradually, forcing the watcher to challenge early assumptions.  I do enjoy watching it on Amazon (free, thanks to my Amazon Prime membership) and viewing two or three episodes at a time.  One can really get wrapped up in this series.  Overall, Torchwood is fun and spunky entertainment.
B00028HBKC|3|Bought this as a gift.  The person bought for enjoys this movie.  They requested this so I bought it for them.

0848813065|5|&quot;The Never Ending Story&quot; is full of so much. From the beginning,  the author serves to capture your imagination. I myself was entranced from  the first page, and knew that this book was perfect for me just a few more  pages in, when I read the author discuss Bastian's love for reading, a love  which mirrored my own.      This book serves to combine both parts 1 and 2  of &quot;The Neverending&quot; movies, but is so much better. While I will  always hold Part 1 as a part of my childhood, it could never compare to  this wonderful book.      Bastain is both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  His insecurites remind me of my own as a child. The adventures of Atreyu  and Bastian are adventures I myself wished I could take when I was younger,  and still do sometimes today. This book allowed me to take those  adventures, and for that, it is one of the best book I can say I have ever  read.
0061478784|4|This was a book for all ages that enjoy a good fantasy. It was never dragging and had lots of fun tongue and cheek and you could really relate to Sophie [both young and old Sophie] It is a book that I will pass on to my Grandkids.

0439023521|5|So I realize I'm behind on this \\"Hunger Games\\" phenomena, but I've finally jumped on that bandwagon. I recently bought the entire series, and in less than 24 hours I've already devoured the first book of the series.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a thrilling futuristic tale of a country and government gone terribly wrong. The country, Panem, is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. The Capitol forms the government that pretty much controls all districts, and on a specific period of every year, there occurs what is called the day of the Reaping. The reaping involves randomly choosing one boy and one girl of every district to participate in the annual Hunger Game event. With 24 participants, there can only be one survivor. The purpose of this appalling game? To remind the people who is in charge, and who is in power by punishing their children after the districts attempted to rebel against the Capitol many years ago.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is reality TV at its most realistic. It is a fusion of Big Brother and Survivor, only at its most extreme. With the cameras, the government surveillance, the public mind control and the political agenda involved it reminded me so much of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four - which is another futuristic, yet classic novel written in 1949. To me, this almost seemed like the young adult version of it, and I think that's fantastic. About time someone ventured to write such a serious novel, placed in a fantasy fiction setting with a blend of romance, for the younger generations to read. In fact, parts of it (specifically those that took place in the arena), was very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies in its savagery, and other parts of it reminded me of Harry Potter's Goblet of Fire tournament.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins, you are a genius. Finally, another good series I can obsess about - the last one being J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Okay now, off to read the next installment!
B00FATEJYE|5|This is my favorite game along with doctor who and castle clashers  I really like this game all super hero fans should play th oily s
B000001Y42|4|This album took me a while to get into-after the softer option of Sig. Oth. But then I truly believed that Limp were the band for me and that when I was old and grey, I would be pumping the sounds of this cd out of my window at the old peps home. That is what this album did to me. This album was the best that Limp had to offer and even though they have gone downhilll since, I am still holding out hope. And am I the only one who thinks that John Otto is underated? Buy this album to awaken your senses
B009361C5O|1|Where is security, AVG offer out of date version!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Love, love, love this series!  Wish there were more shows like this made!  Wonderful plot, no cursing or great actors!
B00BJ9VBLI|5|I enjoy this game. Simple yet with a bit of a challenge, and you don't find yourself buying more moves like with Candy Crush.
B001GAPC1K|5|I know a little bit about Blu-ray but I am not an expert on it, however, movies look much better if they are Blu-ray compared to upconverting DVDs. As for the movie, it combines all the elements of great comic books: smart, fun, plenty of action, and an intriguing story line; these movie elements are put into a cage together until they make babies, of these babies, only the aesthetically pleasing one is removed while the other chimera are put up for adoption or put to sleep. Iron Man is the baby they kept.
630542828X|5|Remember watching it in high school. Love every minute of it. Not many movies about the law hold up to it.
B009TGXLZM|5|I loved this movie.
B004SJ3BCI|3|its okay
B00TXC4YVW|5|Jonathan comes through again. Great info to crush small stakes tournaments, Jonathan's explanation and thought process is very easy to understand a must read if you struggle with adjusting to different playing styles you will face. I can't say enough how Jonathan's content has help my overall game.
B006LSZECO|5|Gone Girl is one of the best books I have read lately!  It's one of those books that you think you have figured out and then the author completely twists the plot around and leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat while reading! Once you start reading, you can't put it down!
B005CRQ4GU|5|It is romantic and funny I can't stop reading it .you should read it. Read it read it read it
B008M7JODC|5|Love science?? This will blow your mind.. though too much of fiction, will make you think what if it was possible?
B000PDYVVG|2|I watched the movie, really enjoyed it. The book however after the first section on Italy....not so much! it drug on and I couldnt finish the book
B005LF9IO8|4|Item arrived well packaged, on time and as described in the item description. Great quality and can easily recommend to others.
0307276902|2|I know this book has spoken to so many addicts - and if it accomplishes healing tasks and a stepping stone for people to boost themselves up and re-build their lives - I'm thrilled. But I honestly don't get all the hype. Even before the post-Oprah expose of the \\"whole truth\\" of the book, I found it to be far less than critics who I really respect were making it to be. It's sort of like this - instead of I go on the mountain, I discover nirvana, I give it to the people - it's - I go to rehab - I realize I AM nirvana (it's all about me, I don't really need you), and you should realize it's all about YOU. Me, me, me, that's all I kept reading through the lines of the book - it seems to saturate our culture of narcisism and fascination with our own belly lint - and I wonder - is it really all that helpful ultimately to believe it's all about you and your power? <br /> <br />Having said this, there were important moments in this book - whether they were contrived or not doesn't really matter to me - because Frey's heart is not contrived. I just hope that this is but the beginning of Frey's journey, and that he does find a way to not have to take on it all himself. I know he does do this through some of the characters - Leonard really is a great one - he made me really care about Leonard. But maybe some of the precepts of AA aren't as unneccessary as you think.
B009LDD1X0|5|It's Big Bang. What else is there to say.
B008602KQI|5|I was very happy with buying Hunger games after watching it to see what many were talking about. And because I am a fan of Josh Hutcherson<br /> I felt like I was part of the action as the game was being played. I would have to say this movie is well worth buying and watching for the unendless<br />  action in it. All the actors did a amazing job with the parts.
B00FRVH3V6|5|My son doesn't like to read and couldn't wait for this book to come out! He's read the whole series!
B002BPRZU0|5|As it was with Beth Hart Joe Bonamassa is yet another stellar performer that I have just recently discovered.  This guy can really play the guitar!!!  At the tender age of eight Joe's father brought home a viceo tape of Clapton playing the Royal Albert Hall.  Upon viewing the tape Joe thought he could do that.  At the age of twelve he opened  for B.B. King.  Fast forward many years and it is Joe on the stage of Albert Hall.  This album is the real deal.<br /><br />Also recommended is Joe and Beth Hart in collaboration  on &#34;Don't Explain&#34;.
0465022227|2|So the author starts the book by giving so many scary stories about PhDs who fail to make the right decision during or after the graduation, so they end up with jobs that are beneath their levels or unsatisfactory. Although I agree with him that these things happen, I believe that collecting all of these sorts of stories in a tiny book like this and make it sound like this is the real life after graduation is misleading.<br />There are several good points raised in the book, but I think the cynical writing style made me not take it seriously.
B00WP8QDUQ|5|Still writing and performing as well as ever.  What a treasure.
B000002UAO|5|This album is fantastic. It seems to be the middle album between the era of the more &quot;Pop&quot; style of &quot;Hold your Hand&quot; and the more FM radio oriented acid trip stuff. It really is a historic piece  because it does document a transition period. Besides.. Norweigan wood was  the first song I learned to play on guitar so that makes this my favorite  album.
B002PZ8YCO|5|I LOVE THESE TYPES OF MOVIES ABOUT REAL PEOPLE.  I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED MISS POTTER AND RECOMMEND TO ANYONE ONE.
6302994063|5|With children watched video no fewer than 100 times -- all at once, in bits and pieces.  You know kids, once they get hooked... <br />Get the sound-track too and dance your way through the dishes at night.
B00000JCEC|4|Released at a time in which Ringo's solo work was regarded more as a hobby than a career, \\"Time\\" turned out to be Ringo's most serious and musically consistent album. Though there are multiple producers and writers involved, the songs all seem tied by a theme: cautions about life's hard knocks from someone who's been there.    The sound is professional, and Ringo seems to be trying hard to be a real singer here, not just some pal who likes to belt out tunes. It really raised my opinon of Ringo, and I'm glad I have it in my collection.
B002TLSSXO|5|Very nice and sturdy. Really like the utensils, they sit a little above stove top and counters...so they leave less mess than traditional types. Easy to clean.
B00785P2QC|4|I like this game after 2 minutes of buying it I gave it 4 stars though because there is another type of currency which is energy it is very hard to get you have to wait  5 minutes to get 1 energy to get more than one at a time you have to complete a goal all in all though a very fun game
B0023SDPS6|5|Walt and his crew, especially his best friend Henry make for a great read. They are three dimensional characters whose interaction is some times laugh-out-loud funny and other times very touching.
B00G7QPUII|3|Wish it could have been an iTunes copy.  Could not get this new service to work independent of internet connection.
B0063IH60K|5|love it very easy to play and not bogged down with other items. I like this one over many others out there
B001BANK32|5|I am writing this review several years after reading the book. Why? Because I still vividly remember the feeling of hair-standing-up on the back of my neck,and let me stress; The Book! Not the movie. With so very many years having passed since the release of this 'beast of absolute horror' upon the public, there have been many other great books able to scare you, for a little while. The Shining is one of the few that takes over your imagination and lets the horror in. Things happen in this book that just cannot be, at least until you actually see it happen because King has possessed your imagination to the point where you see what he wants you to see. This book stands as his best work, at least to this reader.
B0089EHWQE|5|Excellent read!<br />Wonderful plot, heart warming characters, impossible relationship, with a memorable ending. This book will haunt you long after you finish reading.
B003KUSUG8|5|Great Album!
B005ZOBNOI|5|A beautifully written look into the real world issues some families face every day. This was sweet and sad and wonderful.
0316056898|5|I was afraid I had set my hopes too high for this book - but boy was I wrong!  I read some of it on an airplane and my huffs of my enjoyment I'm sure were a little annoying to my neighbor.  I'm sorry, mystery Denver traveler!<br /><br />While I wouldn't use this book as a professional development guide for being a boss, there were two small parts I was impressed by - one of which I took a picture of and sent to my boss, as he nails it on the head.<br /><br />Mostly, this was a funny take on bits and pieces of Tina's life.  While I'm a fan of hers, I'm not obsessed, so everything I read was news to me.  The chapters where very short and easy to read in small spurts, which is a huge plus for me.  I also want to go back and reread sections, which makes this deserving of the 5th star in this review.<br /><br />While I don't think I would have spent the money for this on hardback, either the digital copy or the mass-market paperback were totally worth it.
B005QF0GIK|1|I'm being somewhat sarcastic, but when listening to this offering I kept thinking, wow, this would be a great soundtrack for the Twilight Movies. Depressing, devoid of musical interest (with almost no exception), monotone. I kept waiting to get the \\"point\\" of the project, but by song #9 I was ready to run the bathwater and look for a straight razor to slit my wrists! I am a big fan of Meshell and am ready to take many musical leaps and twists with her as she grows as a musician/artist/woman/human, but this one left me cold. Song #10 was passable, #12 had some interesting musicality, and finally #13 was something I could finally say, OK I like it...Not sure if I can suffer through another listening session to see if I missed something, or maybe I'll just give it to my Pop music driven daughter? I was so excited when it came in the mail too, DAMN!
B00DPM7TIG|5|I loved the vivid descriptions - throughout the book I thought I was there! The love of man and the beast in man are vividly displayed.<br />  I thought the ending was a bit abrupt!  However. In retrospect it too portrayed life as it is.  How sad !
B00A0SICYI|5|An all time family classic that is timeless. Funny and very entertaining with wonderful musical numbers. The story also contains a relevant social message. We can watch this over and over for years. Highly Recommend!!!
B0061JPYX2|3|Amy Winehouse has one of the most beautiful, sophisticated voices of our time her and her potential will be forever mourned.  I bought this CD for \\"Will you still love me tomorrow\\" which she did for the movie \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\".  I was ever so surprised that this song was not the same cut used in the movie but one where tacky over produced percussion prevailed.  It's hard not to focus on the background clatter.  Sooo disappointing.
B001TKD4ZI|5|FUNNY.  THRILLING.  ROMANTIC.  SEXY SCENES WELL WRITTEN, NOT TOO RAUNCHY.  THIS WAS A GREAT ESCAPE READ, VERY FUN.
B00622BF40|5|I never tire of watching this movie. I finally purchased a copy. Even though dated, it is always fresh and captures my interest. I always catch something I never noticed before. Lots of Aussie actors that you will recognize from other Australian films like Muriel's Wedding.
B00JB3MVCW|1|While this movie may be enjoyed by science fiction lovers, only a very small portion of it is Biblical.  Very disappointing.
B00846TRHY|5|Great movie but not for the faint at heart
B00IFOOPM2|4|Enjoyed the movie. Like how that manage to keep original cast members. Can't wait to see if there will be another movie
B00GIXWXEO|5|we rent it for a family movie night and were very pleased with it.  a cute story that inspires to dream and believe you can do it.
B00AREIAI8|4|Really like playing this game. I do wish the gems were easier to get though. It's fun and creative! Worth downloading.
0070511136|5|intially the Name &quot;Spin Selling&quot; came across to be as some cheesy and manipulative model being taught by the author.<BR>after reading various books and attending seminars and workshops i was consistently referred to this book.<BR>also i researched some of the high-performance Sales Professionals and most of them had training on SPIN Selling, so<BR>i finally decided to read Rackham's book &quot;SPIN Selling&quot; and<BR>i'm glad i did and yes this book i feel is the Foundation of all the Modern Sales Training out there.<br />His Training is backed with extensive proof and facts and every single advice is backed by extensive research conducted by huthwaite. very impressed.<br />&quot;Situation - Problem - Implication and Need-Payoff&quot;, these are the four types of Questioning you will learn and the Value and relative importance of each and in what order to be used effectively.<br />the biggest lesson for me is the Difference of a &quot;Implied Need&quot; compared to &quot;Explicit Need&quot; and how it all boils down to uncovering &quot;Explicit Needs&quot; and to communicate with customers about &quot;Benefits&quot;. this book also clears a very common mistake a lot of us do, to look at a product or solution's advantages and convey that as Benefit to customer. As per the author a &quot;Benefit&quot; is one that solves a Customer's &quot;Explicit Need&quot;.<br />don't be discouraged by any review that writes off the book's  style of writing to be research oriented, the book is around 190 Pages and it's worth the weight in gold.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Tons of fun.  Love love love this game.  Very very very very much fun. I can't stop playing it.Love it.
B00G4Q3KOC|5|saw the movie kudos needed to have it in my collection
B00HLTD49C|3|intertaining
B006CHML4I|5|dial is a bit small for my wrist but a great piece otherwise. easily adjustible for comfort and to set date and time.
B00OKYQZDI|5|Great game and and can become addicting.
B000XUBFE2|5|Imagine, if you can, a story narrated by Death in the heart of Nazi Germany.  Imagine what Death sees as he watches one small German foster child, a girl, who loses her mother and her brother.  Then watch her as the war rages on and her life becomes harder and harder and yet easier and easier as it fills with words and love.  But as Death will let us know, don't count on things getting better forever.  It can get worse.  And it does.  And it can get even worse after that.<br />JW
B00JBEI7VK|4|Anxiously awaiting more levels... Maybe it's just my phone, but the rotation when aiming could be slower to increase accuracy. Also, when your dragging a beam and your finger goes over another mirror, it changes to that mirror. Would be nice if it would ignore that to keep from switching when you don't want it to. Facebook share doesn't work for some reason.
B00000ADG2|5|One of the Greats Of All Time!!! When she raps she is absolutely in the top 2% of MCs EVER. When she sings she has so much soul and depth in her voice. Every song is original and masterfully performed. This is still ahead of &#34;artist&#34; releasing music in 2015.
B003M6EAXM|5|Easy to use...<br />Drama... Action...Nailbiting...Suspense....What a great Show ... Amazon is &#34;Amazing&#34;...<br /><br />Just Do It.....You'll Love it.... Thank Me Later...but Thank Amazon Now!
B000002J2F|5|With this CD, Genesis makes good use of its progressive roots for sadly, the last time. The majority of the tracks here use quite a bit of that hard-line progressivism, from the opening &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; and &quot;Man Of Our Times&quot; to the fantastic encore &quot;Duke's Travels/Dukes End&quot;. &quot;Duke&quot; also contains a softer, easy-going side in tracks like &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;,&quot;Heathaze&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot;, which all makes for an interesting, well-balanced blend of music. Since this is Genesis' last stand of progressive rock, you'll want to add &quot;Duke&quot; to your &quot;must-have&quot; collection.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Works
B007SSDS24|1|I would have preferred to have sat in the DARKEST closet instead of watched this piece of garbage. Go towards the light and forget this one.
B0096DFBZQ|3|An okay app, considering it was free. It's really tough to the control the car until you figure how to use the commands.  Not a game I frequently play so I haven't figured all of the bonus points you can pick up during the race.
B009R659L8|5|Didn't see that coming - always a great twist.  Will be reading more of her books.  No more to say.
B000QRIGLC|3|Very  Intertaing
B0014DW3OS|5|Awesome movie. Denzel Washington is an amazing actor.
B007SOQBCM|5|It's a great app for watching people play video games and learn if you want the game or not.
B00J2VSS0C|1|the first two were fun...this one was SO complicated...I don't care to have to think that much when playing a game at night before bed...not sure why they had to add all the bells and whistles...perhaps others like that sort of thing but I do not...
B00B0LPWU6|5|Excellent movie all around. Amazing performance by Denzel Washington as well as all the other actors. Like others, I didn't know what to expect from this movie (didn't read the reviews). I came away from the movie feeling and thinking differently, and I quite like that.<br /><br />As a recovering alcoholic, I was truly amazed that a movie could capture the feeling of the absolute trap that alcohol is. There are other movies that straddle the same storyline, but this was deeply moving and in the end inspiring in the way that religion, love, and forgiveness can make all the difference in the world.<br /><br />The scene in the hotel room near the end is priceless... and every alcoholic knows that quiet knock, that barely perceptible call that  alerts us that there is alcohol somewhere close. This scene may seem hard to believe for others, but believe me it is very real.<br /><br />Everything wrapped up nicely when Denzel's character was in the courtroom at the end. I was truly surprised by the choice he made.<br /><br />Very powerful movie!
B00AMBLDEE|4|Good action and a continuation of the series.  There are a few unreal scenes, but which action movie doesn't?  :-) Highly recommend it.
B008GXHOFW|4|wish the controls responded to what I'm actually doing a lot of the time (which is pretty much every Spidey game), otherwise great fun
B0023SDPS6|5|Great book, great story line, great writer!!!<br />Once I started to read, it was very hard to put down.  Main character is a real character!
B0054JZC6E|3|Good game but the mini games are a little to hard and aren't as good they could be a lot better.
B00IG2DOKM|5|I love this game. It's so much fun designing my town. I play daily. It's a great game. I recommend this game to family and friends.
B00CO52NLI|5|10 year old loves it!
B00CO4GO7I|5|Outstanding book. Superb candid writing that captured the events and emotions. I was already interested in the subject matter but got way more than I expected. Amazing story told by an inspirational true hero.
B003O85W3A|4|So, so good. My favorite is still Funeral, but maybe because I've only listened to the Suburbs a few times. What I love about Arcade Fire is that every song is different than the last.  I tire easily with other bands because their music sounds the same across an album. AF is so much better.
0316067938|5|I simply could not put this book down !  This past month was the first time I watched/read anything Twilight related. I am totally hooked! Therefore I watched Twilight, New Moon, & Eclipse all within a week timeframe.  The suspense for next movie was killing me so I went and purchased Breaking Dawn.  I have always been a huge reader, but to read 754 pages in 72 hours....I must say I've out done myself this time.  I could read this book again & again !
B00A8ECU24|5|it will for sure keep you occupied.. my daughter and I both play this together its a fun game to play!!! when you aint got nothing to do!
B004P8JPS6|4|I'm usually &#34;dismayed&#34; when a Reacher book is finished. I was &#34;cheered&#34;<br />to have the bonus short story as a marvelous continuation.  Like a<br />satisfying dessert after a wonderful meal.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Mr. Child's style: (Reacher's approach to investigating,<br />interrogating, and solving situations).  I have read 15 of the Reacher<br />series and thoroughly enjoyed them all...some more than others, but<br />grateful for learning things I was not aware of in all of them while<br />being entertained in the process.  Thanks for the Bonus short story<br />which certainly added insights to what helped motivate a lot of<br />Reachers choices.
B00TYB95I4|5|Good story great acting im not into these types of movies but I enjoyed this film
B007EE564U|4|Normally I wouldn't read a gun-ho novel like this, but The Last Man was a good intelligent read that although a fictional novel,, gave you an insight into the factional fighting between the USA's security agencies, with common sense prevailing eventually in this novel!
B00003CXZ4|5|Don't get this backwards, I really did love this movie (the screenplay, the acting, the filming).  It's just I felt a little, um, uncomfortable, each time a scene ratcheted back, and we find the main character in the equivalent position of somebody that's had the ol' shaving cream-and-feather prank done to them while they're sleeping.  He is constantly \\"reawakening\\" due to his medical condition, and usually it is with figurative egg/pie/shaving cream on his face...he is constantly momentarily confused until he figures out what has just gone on.  <br />He is on a Dirty Harry type of avengement for his wife's rape and murder, but his clothes don't fit right, his car looks like he forgot to buff the wax off, and he's constantly looking for his Life under the couch cushions.   Everybody calls him Lenny, which he hates.  He gets tricked into doing everything from paying for two hotel rooms to carrying out somebody else's vendetta.  Still, you root for the guy, which may make this one huge practical joke on the viewer...you end up feeling at the end of the movie like somebody slipped something in your drink.
B007FG9LIE|3|First, let me say that I didn't put the book down and it was an interesting read.  The ending certainly threw me for a loop.  That being said, I will attempt to explain why I only thought the book was &#34;okay&#34;.<br /><br />I could not put the book down primarily because I kept wanting to be satisfied with the story on the next page.  It was like going to a restaurant, eating an appetizer and then going straight to dessert with no main coarse.  It is difficult to explain, but when I had read the whole book, I felt as though everything I read could have been summed up in 100 pages.  I wanted more sustenance and I am unsure at this time if I want to continue with the trilogy.
B009MCRHH6|4|I liked it. 17 more words required. 13 more words required. 9 more words required. 5 more words required. done.
1781162646|4|Not your typical Stephen King book, but I really enjoyed reading it.......plus it's about an amusement park, the 70's and in NC, what more can you want?
B000000H4V|5|As a big Sepulfan I'm a fan of all there albumns but this is only second to Beneath the Remains. Arise is awesome to and its hard to compare that to this beacause the music styles are so different but overall Id say this wins it. Chaos A.D. was when Sepultura added there tribal element, that they took a lot further in Roots, and when they got a lot slower like in the song Amen. There are still some good fast ones too like Bitoch is Godzilla. Really all the songs are awesome except I think Amen could be expendable, the song seemed like it was just kinda dragging along. Of course the obvious standouts are Refuse/Resist, Territory, and Slave New World which all had music videos made. And the tribal jam Kaiowas is really cool to. All of this is kept up by Igor Calaveras awesome drumming which I think reached its peak in this albumn. The bonus tracks are really cool with a Amen/Innerself medly and live tracks of Territory and Kaiowas.<BR>So all in all if your willing to slow down a little from Beneath the Remains and Arise and experiment a little or if your a fan of Roots definitly pick this one up.
B003F3FJQO|4|*******************Spoiler Alert*************<br /><br />The story is great except for the ending.  The last fight scene was pretty dumb before WICKED picked them up again.  I also did not understand how WICKED, with all their unlimited technology, was surprised to find Jorge and Brenda were picked up and ended up on the Berg....I mean, They knew Thomas was shot and they rescued him and returned him to the group, how would they not know two strangers were along for the trip?  Those are my only complaints, maybe my questions will be answered in the third book.  Aside from the couple of gripes, the story is amazing and detailed.  It will make a fantastic second movie to the first Maze Runner.  I did like it enough that I will be buying the third book to read.  Do not let my complaints deter you.  The author does a great job and I will look into his other series too.  One last thing....Thomas is kind of a wimp in my opinion and is carried throughout the story by the other Gladers and the girls from Group B.  I hope Thomas cowboys up in the third book.
B007J4T2G8|1|I read it just to know what all  the pubilicity<br /><br /> was all about.  It's bad written, the caracteres are dull, the narrativa is boring and  without imagination....a product like fast food, easy to read, no surprises, and easy to forget.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Love, love, love it!!  Tatiana Maslany is so talented!
031219126X|5|When I first heard about Frankenstein from my friend and watched the movie, I thought this was a horrible movie which was about a psychological disordered scientist and the monster that he created. However, when I read the book, especially after I searched the author Mary Shelley's background, I realize that this is such a profound story which illustrates race discrimination issues, life tragedy, and so many other topics that we are still struggling with today. I consider Frankenstein combines the elements of Mary Shelley's life, for Victor Frankenstein, a talented scientist who obsessed with creating a new life from dead body, has the same tragedy life as Mary Shelley. In the book, Victor Frankenstein lost his mother, father and lover incessantly. In reality, Mary Shelley lost her father, child, and husband and died alone. In the end, Victor Frankenstein chases behind the monster in the North Pole and tries to kill him, just like Mary Shelley wanted to capture and kill her fate and get out of its control. I love this book because of its rich contents and the issues that it connects with.
0792140923|1|Having worked for many years with the mentally retarded I was shocked by Hanks portrayal.  He has taken a serious and debilitating human condition and turned it into a cheap and tawdry satire.  He has created the  impression that people with this disability can achieve a level of  functioning that is, through no fault of their own, impossible, and further  eroded tolerance for these people by creating the impression that they do  not achieve these impossible goals simply because they have no ambition or  willingness to do so.  If my children were still young you can bet they  would not see this.  Only Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor the Vietnam amputee  turned alcoholic indicated any empathy with the human condition.
B00TEAVEY8|2|Fun, but energy runs out very quickly. Then they think you're going to spend money to get more. No way. People play FREE games for a reason!
1451668945|4|Daddy's Gone A Hunting<br />Mary Higgins Clark<br />Simon & Schuster, Apr 9 2013, $26.99<br />ISBN: 9781451668940<br /><br />Retired Gus Schmidt meets CPA Kate Connolly at four thirty in the morning at her family-owned Connelly Fine Antique Reproductions in Long Island City; where he once worked.  An explosion leaves Gus dead and Kate unconscious.  While Kate lies comatose and unable to defend herself, rumors abound as to why she met with a former employee before the place was open.<br /><br />Her sister, fashion designer Hannah, wants the truth, which she believes will exonerate her sibling.  Clues lead to the disappearance almost three decades ago of an aspiring actress from Illinois whose attorney brother has just moved to the city and to a two years old cold case murder of a Barnard student.<br /><br />Readers who can ignore the quadrillion happenchance plot forwarding moments will enjoy this suspenseful tale; as Hannah, bungling her amateur sleuthing endeavor, brings tension to the entertaining storyline; more than the villain and the felonious few abetting the culprit.  Though not one of Mary Higgins Clark's stronger thrillers, fans of the author will want to know what is going on in this exciting mystery.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0063GORYU|5|Very addictive. Time flies by!
B004SJ3BCI|3|Well executed game with nice graphics but after a while you get sick and tired os shooting birds at pigs. my 3  year old and 10 year old used to love this but after a month or 2 they got bored and just went on to the next game. Itsagood thing this one was free because it only lasted a short time.  I only recommend this to people with a large attention span.
B008XG1X18|5|This app works really well and is very updated. I love how easy it is to move around and find certain people or items with such easy.
B00BIPORC8|5|If you like &#34;Law in order&#34;you like this.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This for me is everything Flappy Bird should have been! Love the artwork and how addicting the game is without being rage inducing. The choices for the characters is awesome and I like trying to unlock the secret ones.
B00PTB7B34|5|:) game with descent graphics
B004EBT5CU|5|Adele is wonderful!  Her music, her style, her demeanor, her enthusiasm for life, her ability to connect with her public!  Gotta love it! Can't get enough of her music!
B007L3BMGA|3|How this book became a \\"hit\\" is beyond me.  Based on reviews and word-of-mouth from other moms (like me) it sounded very intriguing and a bit naughty (tsk, tsk) so I figured I'd give it a read.  Well, I have to say that by 75% I was so fed up that I had to stop reading.  I finally had to admit to myself that I couldn't stand the heroine, Anastasia, any longer.  The way she thinks, what she says and does...nope.  And the writing -- suffice it to say that my 13 year old could write better than this.  Broken lines and thoughts and just the silly things that she says just didn't work for me.  Maybe this is why I wasn't a \\"Twilight\\" fan, Bella worked my every last nerve, too.<br /><br />A lot of people say \\"well, certainly the sex kept you interested, right?\\"  Yeah, not so much either.  She was SO uninitiated, and SO out-there acting that it just kind of killed it for me.  I'm sorry, I just can't see any dom who's well into his practice going for a sub like this.  With the kind of money and power that Christian has it was very unbelievable to me that he would want to take this girl under his whip and chains and train her.  Yes, it was hot for a while, then it just became boring to me.
B006GLLXXK|5|Loved it!!
B0081L37Z0|4|Cute.
B0089LOG02|5|If you a lover of heart ache and hero's this is your book. Can't tell you how many times I wanted to hurt a grown up or how many times I ballyhooed and cried for the trust children have in adults. Alive today, the do goodies, thinking no one deserves what they have and everyone should be grateful for the experience of being helped. These people threw more children into the hands of horrible people just for the ease of getting rid of them. Never checking out what kind of people they were. Thank God things are different today. What a great ending and I agree that people with hardships are stronger people.
B009VSW15Y|3|I had not realized that my Kindle fire had a camera in place, so I ordered the HD camera.  It is not clear how this works.  Do I point the screen out or not?  How do I save photos?  The kindle is intuitive to a great extent, but I think that clear instructions accompanying new &#34;apps&#34; would be particularly helpful.
B0041KKYD8|5|One of the best thriller, horror and suspense series.<br /><br />If you trust me, this is the movie where every movie lovers should get:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JNNDBA?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B001JNNDBA&linkCode=shr&tag=nealo10a-20&linkId=XDJA42P42ISPI5F7
B00DZSPKZY|5|I have this on two different phones and it works great on both (one running stock gingerbread, and the other CM10.2) I have used other launchers in the past but this is compact and clean and I love the ability to hide apps. I was using the free version until recently but decided that it was past time to purchase it.
B00ELE8D4Q|5|Got the album so I could learn the songs before her concert!  She gives an AWESOME concert. Driving to Tulsa, OK to see it!
B0098VXE50|5|I loved this movie because of the special effects. Sharon Stone was fantastic in her role as the wicked queen. I never lost interest so that shows me it was a good movie!
B00A1XOPE8|5|I love and hate these short stories, they are always to the point so tend to be fascinating reads however the brevity leaves much to be desired. You rarely get to see the world from more than one persons point of view - which in this case is a shame as there seems to much more going on in the world<br /><br />A must read however, great for a rainy lazy afternoon
B00K0OI42W|5|Loved this book !!
B004GHBQ7O|5|While not as impressive as \\"Bullet In A Bible,\\" this live CD/DVD provides an excellent account of the \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" tour. Old stuff, new stuff, stuff you haven't heard before, it's all here. It's a document of where the band is now - live and in person. Check it out if you're a fan. If you're not - well why the f**k not?
B00000J7J4|5|I was in 'Nam in '69 -- missed Woodstock, but heard about Santana.  Jingo drove me nuts when it came out.  The 70's were still young when EVERYONE's list of the five best guitar players included Carlos. He's still one of the  best and still CREATING music -- not just playing it. Every track on this  CD is great -- even the track with Lauryn Hill (I'm really tired of hearing  about her kid, Zion, on every song she does). The really great thing about  this CD is that Carlos introduces talents like Rob Thomas, Dave Mathews,  and Eagle Eye Cherry to older Santana fans like me who might not otherwise  hear these people. His music is timeless and the last track with Eric  Clapton lets us hear the two best living guitarists on the same song. Ole,  Carlos!
B004EPYZP8|5|There are a small handful of movies I don't mind watching multiple times, whereas most movies are good for only one viewing.  This is a movie I know I will be watching again.  I already have a daddy/daughter date set up for my second viewing.  When my wife finishes school and finally has more time on her hands, I know I'll have another viewing.  I have the book ordered too, and I'm looking forward to its arrival and reading.  Usually the books are better than the movies, but this is an excellent movie.  You will be entertained, thrilled, surprised, and satisfied when the end finally rolls around.  If you like John Grisham's lawyer movies, you should enjoy this one.
B007STXHTM|5|It's a standard Go pro 2 housing.  Worked as advertised.  No issues at all and would recommend this to anyone with a hero 2.
B004CFBMRY|5|Great book, great story and really made me get up and get running again. There are very few books that I'd be dying to get back to reading it during the day, but this was one. Great book.
B0000C3I6U|5|Love this movie. Such a great documentary. It inspires and motivates you to never give up and keep pressing forward!
B00HY7VU60|2|Thirty-five characters named Henry. All the white queens look alike.
B00A8SPNYW|2|Overly long intro and insufficient instructions hamper what could be an interesting game. However, it freezes at Level 3 everytime. (Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G).<br /><br />First four reviews clearly written by developer make me more dubious about the game. {Hint to Developer(s): Don't use the same speech patterns and descriptive phrases in each review. And don't post about the great gameplay for it being FAOTD when it was debuted only 5-10 minutes before the review is posted.}
B008BU75IQ|4|Story very good but ending such a drop.  Need to know what happens to the boys.<br /><br />Not good way to end...
B007ZGO7EM|5|love this little tool.  very easy to use. it does what I need it to do for my daily challenge.
B007N5YIUS|5|I thought at first it was just going to be a regular angry bird app with a space theme. That would have been cool. But instead they have completely changed the physics engine of the game. Gravity now plays a role and sometimes you have to sling-shot around multiple objects...it's really neat when the pigs freeze in the colds of space.
B00407PNWO|5|Great movie. Like this Robin Hood a lot.
B00MNYTWMI|4|Fast easy puzzles, different areas to explore. Great graphics. No crashing or freezing issues. Different games inside the game. Energy replenished very quick so delays aren't long between play.
B00DG292SK|1|Save your time and money on this poorly written book.  It is a seemingly endless diatribe of a petulant person who is trying to overly intellectualize his life.  The descriptions of excess are what you would expect from a rock musicians life but tend to pale in comparison to those of some of the more extreme examples (e.g. Keith Richards and Greg Allman).  He is way too analytic about his projects and runs on at length about minutia of some of his projects.<br /><br />It was a chore to finish this book and when I did I would have to say I was disappointed that I spent the time reading such a poorly written book.  If you feel the need to torture yourself reading this mess then save your money and check it out from a library.
B00C2C637I|2|I haven't finished reading this, but I don't know if I will. I don't buy the premise and I don't get the setting.
B005HV6YO8|3|there are better choices than this cd
B00785P2QC|3|Game is a fun distraction and there is a lot to do. Wish I did not have to post to Facebook for everything but that is life. Blah blah blah blah
B00005RY7X|5|This isn't an album for the chin-stroking intellectual, subtlety isn't a word in Andrews vocabulary it would seem.  Its a return to the fist-pumping anthems of yesteryear, and I couldn't be more pleased.  This is the cure for noodling, alienation, and boredom.  It is headbanging music, it is the enemy for the elitists, its ultra-polished heavy metal with absolutely no apologies for being that way.  Its extraordinarily catchy, I put this on in the car, I get strange looks, but then we all headbang in unison, its wonderful.  So, for 30 minutes of power to cleanse yourself of your loneliness and despair or of a dose of Amnesiac, look no farther.
B002AWX6UM|4|I recommend it for anyone who wants to grasp from the outside what many Africans are still facing today, and now many families in the Middle East.  It offers hope of recovery and redemption for children whose humanity has been almost destroyed by war.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Very entertaining. Never disappointed.
B00FLML7HW|5|I am a huge X-Men fan and when I saw the price on this 6 movie set I just couldn't pass it up. The picture quality is fantastic and it brings to life this amazing movie series. I love the low profile of the box, for a six movie set it is a small box and I love that for space saving purposes. Overall this is a great buy for any X-Men fan.
B004Q0R7FG|5|My son loves trains. I have bought many tracks and trains and the Chuggington series is by far his favorite. I disagree with the other reviews. I have not had problems with mine fitting other sets.
B00EPFEY44|5|He is a great singer and the orchestra is wonderful.
B0052RDHTM|5|Excellent historical novel.
B00003CXA6|5|Not too many war movies can make you understand how brutal, exhausting, emotionally painful, draining, exciting, boring, glorious and ugly war is, but this is one of them.  The scenes of the march starting Pickett's charge alone will blow you away - I understand thousands of men were crying just reenacting it.  The combination of excitement and terror are caught so well at Little Round Top and Pickett's charge that you just can't stop watching.  For the acting - Jeff Daniels nails Joshua Chamberlain - scholar, soldier and brother - so well, I couldn't believe it was Jeff Daniels.  Richard Jordan as \\"Lo\\" Armistead - what can you say?  The man was an incredible actor his entire career, and this, his last performance, a doomed man playing a doomed man - I don't know how he found the inner strength to do it, but it's the best work he ever did.  And while I thought Martin Sheen was miscast at first, the more I watch his performance, the more subtleties I catch, the more I think this might have been his best work, too.  The best thing was that this film made me understand the Civil War and the battle of Gettysburg with an intimacy I never knew before.  It's like a million men from 1863 all looked me in the eye and said, \\"NOW do you understand?\\"  Well, not as well as you did, but a lot better than I did before.
B000Q4RJWW|5|Watched it several times.  Great movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5|I read the book twice.  She had some good cliff hanger yeah it might have miss somethings.  But if you read the author notes she said their is still one more book. Yeah the book sounded like it was about to end.  I too felt like damn this is it.  Some much hasn't been solved. Like who covered for who and her relationship with her mom. But don't give up people I have faith the she will end it with a happy and yet resolving ending .we will get answer . Keep strong

B009JZTOG8|4|The season has been entertaining. The creators have good imaginations to be able to come up with such a variety of story lines.
B00DVKOYBM|2|Ever sense i have had this game it will not let me invite my friends on Facebook so please fix this
B007AL48UK|4|i like most mahjong games .. i like the setups and the pictures are easy to see on the tiles.. so i think this is a good one..
0783225733|5|Great
B00001OH7T|5|I can understand how this album might not appeal to certain people, I suppose. That being said, I suppose the best way to put into words how I feel about this album is that it is like a religious experience for me. <br /> <br />I started out listening to Bowie albums like Ziggy Stardust and Diamond Dogs, so I was totally unprepared when I heard this. My father swore by it, and after listening to it myself I wholeheartedly agree with him that this is a completely underappreciated album. <br /> <br />\\"Young Americans\\" is my second favorite song period. Not second favorite Bowie song, just second favorite period. This song alone is almost worth the price of admission, and I would make the case that it is one of the best songs ever written. Maybe I'm going a bit overboard there, but I'm simply in love with the tune. <br /> <br />As for the meat of the album, turn the stereo up, grab a glass of your favorite wine, dim the lights and enjoy. This album simply screams - or croons, rather - smooth. I'm thinking of \\"Can You Hear Me\\" in particular.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend this album to anyone and everyone, but if you're a Bowie fan and you don't already have this within 10 feet of your person while you read this, you should probably be ashamed of yourself.
B007SYWFRM|4|This game is brilliant its easy enough for the little ones. Keep them busy for hours...i wish u there where more iceage games
B008I43DYU|5|Fun themes. Does what it's supposed to do.
B00IX9UTLU|4|I wouldn't recommend reading directly after 50 shades as there are similarities... But loved the book. Great plot and a couple moments where I laughed or gasped out loud.
B003Y059EK|1|This is yet another example of psychotic &#34;entertainment&#34; - for children?!?!  This was not suitable for children...disturbing and weird and just not fun to watch.
B004LWZW4C|5|Thanks
B003UBTX6S|5|A great book!  This well written fantasy has provided many hours of contented reading.  Way to exciting to put down!
0345404475|5|As one who has seen both the movie and read the book, I must say that, yes, the two seem outwardly different, but they both seem to be about how the plight of androids, imperfect beings who strive to become something  finer, parallels our own human condition. The androids in the movie are  much easier to identify with, since they aren't devoid of empathy the way  they are in the book, but the book manages to convey more strongly the  sense of their deformity. In the movie, the androids want to live longer,  in the book, they want to learn how to empathize the way humans do. As one  of them says, &quot;I really don't like androids. Ever since I got here  from Mars my life has consisted of imitating the human, doing what she  would do, acting as if I had the thoughts and impulses a human would have.  Imitating, as for as I'm concerned, a superior life form.&quot; All in all,  the book left me feeling pretty lonely and depressed. (I mean that in a  good way.)
B006LSZECO|4|A lot of sleep was missed because I didn't /couldn't stop reading this one.<br />Highly recommend to anyone that loves a great plot.
B00L9B7IKE|5|The Girl on the Train totally captivated my interest.  I didn't want to put it down because I couldn't wait to &#34;see&#34; what was going to happen next.
B00992CF6W|3|get it from 4shared it wks. just sign up and get the newest with aneroid sign and some don't wk. some do just keep trying
B00FFERTUK|5|OUTSTANDING, husband wil listen to it a lot.  He likes the sound.  Came in great condition and received it in a short time.  Will be ordering more.
B00701897I|5|Great A++
B006AZZPCM|1|It was a nice app. Now its poop
B002NZTZ8S|5|A fantastic new &#34;classic&#34; to add to your traditional Christmas viewing.  Heartwarming and beautifully done.  It's a must see for the season.
B005VPRETE|5|I bought my daughter a bunch of the LEGO Friends products for Christmas. This is by far her favorite! She loves the interaction in the tree house, a lot of things move and her imagination goes crazy. It was probably the most challenging set she put together, the only one she asked for help with, but in the end everything looks fine and she was very happy. That's all the matters!
B0042U94UQ|3|I was rather underwhelmed by this movie.  There seemed to be so many \\"plot points\\" that were never resolved and only thrown in because the writers couldn't figure out any other way of getting from point A to point B.  The relationship between Vector and one of the other characters is a case in point.  It didn't really seem necessary other than to have someone calling the shots forcing Vector to compete with Gru.  Which, by the way, is another underdeveloped point.  After the initial animosity, they rarely interact.  Gru's need for the moon was repeatedly explained and it had nothing to do with Vector.    There were several funny parts and my husband quotes lines from the movie from time to time.  Usually I am the move quote champ, but to be honest, he usually has to tell me what part of the movie he's quoting because it was a little forgettable.    I can't comment on the 3D aspect as I saw it on DVD not in the theater.  It wasn't until the short scene during the credits that made us remember it was supposed to be a 3D movie.    Bottom line: enjoyable movie, but glad I borrowed this Single-Disc Edition rather than buying my own copy.  My 5 year-old who LOVES movies didn't want to watch it a second time.
B008JGSM6G|4|some hands for lack of better wording, get very tricky they are fun and flow free makes the brain work
0756405890|3|I just couldn't finish it. I read about 200 pages or so, about 1/3 of the way through, and had to put it down.     While the writing has an elegant simplicity to it that is actually quite charming, the story itself is very narrow in scope, and fails to build any excitement or tension. Since the book moves forward as primarily one massive flashback from the singular perspective of an innkeeper (that the reader has very little vested interest in from the get-go, by the way), you know that anything that might or might not happen to him has very little consequence in the future, as he obviously survived to tell the tale from semi-retirement. Thus, very little tension. And sadly, the events themselves were just not that engaging. Traveling musical caravan, twelve-year-old learns stuff from an old-uncle-type that notices just how unique and special the kid is, tell his family he should attend a \\"University,\\" yes, very-Harry Potter-ish, then family gets killed, kid escapes, learns to beg and live on the mean streets, as we are repeatedly pulled though several more flashbacks-inside-the-flashback regarding people and places that don't seem to relate to either the kid or the innkeeper in any significant fashion. Granted, I didn't finish the book, but 200 pages is more than enough of a leash, in my opinion.    Also, a pet peeve of mine is when any author neglects to stick with one characters' perspective, and instead jumps in and out of multiple characters' heads to relate everyone's point-of-view all at once, without starting a new chapter or section to separate the POV's. In this book, it happens often, and sometimes within the same paragraph. In real life, you can't hear everyone's thoughts, so it's somewhat awkward to see it done on the page.    You may think that I simply have no patience, and that might be somewhat true. However, I did make it through two-thousand-plus-pages of George R.R. Martin's Fire and Ice series and loved every minute of it. Also, I just startedTerry Goodkind's \\"Wizard's First Rule\\" and it grabbed hold of me after only 35 pages.    Of course, to each their own... but this book just wasn't for me. Good luck.
B00RHYBCN6|5|Great music to go with a great show!
B005HEJ2DK|4|It is a significant change in story lines from seasons 1 and 2 but enjoyable as they delve deeper into some personalities and difficult moral and ethical situations. Well written and well acted and very visually pleasing.
B009WUAK2M|3|The movie is great, but since I don't have the Kindle with 3G I have to wait till I have wifi to watch it. If it could be downloaded to watch anytime, that would be better.
B001NHNG64|5|I never thought I'd get over the loss of Robert Parker's Spencer, but Reacher has given me new hope.  I adore him!
B00E8KLWB4|4|This a cool game to play when I have down time. Some puzzles are more challenging than others. My 4 yo also enjoys playing.

B000002OYB|5|i would rate meatloaf albums in this order=bat out of hell one and two are the best followed by bat three,than welcome to the neighborhood,than chsib.his eighties albums did not do much for me at all.i think this is a great album and liked every song.unlike another reviewer i thought his voice is excellent.if you are a meatloaf fan you will love this album.where angels sing is a beautiful song ranking up with heaven can wait.
B00D8CSVLW|5|Good read
B00AN0KGWE|5|I absolutely love game of thrones.  After watching a few episodes of the first season I was hooked.  Sadly at the time I had to travel overseas before I could finish the first season.  So I cheated and actually got all the ebooks and read them while I was gone working for a few months.  I actually have read all of them up to the last that George Martin finished which is A Dance With Dragons I believe.  It's been a while.<br /><br />Anyway if you are a fan of mid evil style action and the usual HBO high drama then this is a show for you.  I have yet to meet anyone that has not liked it.  I will admit the television show strays slightly from the books but not in a bad way at all.  For the most part the story line stays intact according to the books.  So far anyway....<br /><br />Great show watch it.
B00005JNS0|5|This movie is fun, comical, and our three year old loves it! He could watch this movie over and over and over. This is our second disk for him because he wore out the first one by handling it too much.
B001BMKOZW|5|Do you like System of a Down? Serj Tankian's 'Elect The Dead'? Do you like how bizarre their music is? The vocals, bizarre screaming and whatnot? You do? case closed - buy this CD.  I read the phrase 'Fierce Weirdness' in a review in Rolling Stone magazine and those words are the perfect review for this CD.  Generally speaking, this sounds like a System CD minus Serj Tankians singing.  I'm not saying that's good or bad(I personally like how Serj and Daron sing together on the SOAD CDs), but that is just what it sounds like to me - a System CD with one band member on vacation.  \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" and \\"Lonely Day\\" from Systems last CDs would fit on this perfectly because those songs were primarily performed by Darion Malakian, who plays everything on this CD except the drums.  The melodies are here starting with the opener \\"Serious\\"(which would make a good theme song for The Joker in the new Batman movie), the riffs, and the 'fierce weirdness' is here(with a touch of Tourette's syndrome thrown in).  The lyrics often do not make a lot of sense to me -which is true of a lot of System songs - but certain phrases sound good to the ear and ultimately it's about how catchy and weird any given song can be.  Who would think singing 'If we're gonna kill each other/how we gonna live forever?/If we're gonna live forever how we gonna kill each other?' would be catchy?(\\"Kill Each Other/Live Forever\\") or the chorus in \\"Chemicals\\" (which I cannot mention here without being severely censored)  A very good CD and if you like System and thier various solo projects, then this one is no different.  Some people whine about Malakian taking over too much on Systems last 2 albums.  If you feel that way, then maybe you shouldn't buy this CD and buy Serj Tankian's \\"Elect the Dead\\"(another great album).  Otherwise, it's great.  Easily one of my favorite CDs of the year.  Get weird!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5|Book goes into the depths of Tartarus which, call me a nerd, but I have kind of always been interested on what it's like. Very gripping and intriguing. Of course it has the happy ending, but it's a great book.
B000B6CODO|5|it was out standing
B00IMYZOBQ|4|The special effects were good.  The movie was too short, only 1 1/2 hours.  After all the hype I expected more.
B00VFTAXUC|4|Good and well written, if a little too long.
B005URRCUY|4|I downloaded this a few months ago because Amazon was having a sale and I liked the songs I hears on the radio like \\"Lonely Boy\\" and \\"Little Black Submarines.\\" The album is good, but inconsistent. What's good is really good, but only like half the songs did anything for me. The songs that are good are really great and catchy, but you sometimes have to weed through the average songs to get to them. Tracks I'd recommend, aside from the two mentioned above are \\"Run Right Back,\\" \\"Hell of a Season\\" and \\"Gold on the Ceiling.\\" My advice is buy the album when it's on sale or something so you pay for only what's good and get the rest in the process.
B0089LOG02|5|Very well written. It kept me very interested and intrigued. The historical facts were sobering and it portrayed part of America's history that is not well publicized. I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend this book.
1592537251|5|I really like the variety of information on this subject; as it is one of the subjects that I have most difficulty drawing. It gives helpful tips as well as shows different examples how several different artists approached different subjects and conditions.
B0094BB4TW|5|😀
B004TACMZ8|3|Easy to use. However, I dont think it sensed wood stud well enough. I eventually hung a picture based on my knowledge of my own home and by knocking on wall. Will test some more and leave an update.
B00A6CCF0K|4|Once more I fell under Stephen King' s spell. The Shining was one of my all time favorite books by King. I too had wondered what happened to Danny and his mother. I  was hooked from the beginning. The addition of Abra was  great. Maybe  we'll see her again sometime.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is so awesome. Defenetly adictive to play.

B0091X74II|4|Very visual and fun, liked it a lot.  Confusing for younger kids, but they still enjoyed it!
B005HEJ2DK|3|Liked the show. Wished it had more to do with other shows storylines. Sad it ended so abruptly  and not replaced by another Star Trek.
B003XF1XOQ|5|heartbreakingly good. didn't want the words to end. their torment cannot be expressed more clearly, nor their love for one another.
B007J4T2G8|5|INITIALLY, I THOUGH, OMG, WHAT A PERVERT.....BUT I AM SO ENTHRALLED WITH THIS SERIES THAT I WISH THERE WERE MORE COMING AFTER PART THREE!
B0000399WI|5|Based on a Stephen King novella and directed by Frank Darabont, this film covers a 20-year period during which Andy Defresne (Robbins), a former banker convicted of murder, somehow preserves his dignity while surviving the brutalities he endures in a state prison in Maine. There are many reasons why this film retains its appeal to me during the eight years since I first saw it. Here are three. First, the evolving friendship between Defresne and \\"Red\\" Redding (Freeman) enables both actors to play off each other while developing their respective, quite different characters. (Color of skin is among the least significant of those differences.) Also, the unhurried pace of the film seems appropriate to the pace of life within a state prison. While seeing this film once again recently, although familiar with all plot details, I found myself relaxing and \\"going with the flow\\" the way many inmates presumably do. Darabont's skillful control of the pace givens sudden, unexpected plot developments even greater dramatic force. Finally, I admire Bob Gunton's portrayal of Warden Samuel Norton, a clever but corrupt and (when he deems it necessary) brutal public official. His fate is obviously not the \\"redemption\\" he has in mind for himself. FYI, cinematographer Roger Deakins was later hired by the Brothers Cohen to provide his services to the filming of Fargo. The Shawshank Redemption now has and certainly deserves a high level of esteem which it did not (but should) have when first released in 1994.
B0063IH60K|4|I have been playing for the last 2days.  Lots of fun.  Works well and I would recommend to a friend.
B00571F26Y|4|I appreciated the recipes that helped put the information into action. Will test it out and see how it goes!
B001FB4W0C|5|When you thoght you saw everything Supernatural give you a kick to let you know that this it is just a beginning
B003VANOFY|1|These things worked for about a week then started cutting in and out for random periods.  Now I can't even get them to stay connected.  Logitech doesn't care. LITERALLY IN MY GARBAGE CAN :(
0345529057|5|Excellent purchase can not put the books down, have been losing sleep due to the books but I do not mind at all.
B005I6EU7U|5|I love this cover, it's beautiful and elegant and works wonderfully. It didn't lay flat at first, but after handling it for a few days that problem was resolved. People are always surprised when I tell them it's not leather because of the look and feel of it. It's one of my happiest purchases and one that I strongly recommend!
B006SMLAMQ|3|This app does come with 3 widgets. You must go into manage applications and move it from your sd card to your internal memory for them to appear.
B000002KHY|3|This CD plays great except it did not download to my ipod. In fact it was replaced by a second one which also did not download.
0345803485|1|I did not list to my better judgment and let the \\"hype\\" get to me. I actually feel more stupid, stupider? (see!) after reading this book. I'm happy for E.L. James and her large paychecks, but ashamed of any publisher or editor who would allow this book to be printed without some major corrections. Our heroine blushes, flushes, gasps and bites her lips when she isn't whining about why our hero is interested in her or what do to about the \\"contract\\" for his BDSM lifestyle. Contrary to what I was told, this is not a BDSM subjected book at all as this subject simply runs in the background of a really poorly written \\"love\\" story. Overall, this book reads exactly like the myriad of fan fictions that live all over the internet.<br /><br />You might be wondering about my title. The word in question when it comes to the first two Fifty Shades books is the word \\"murmur.\\" Now, this may not be the most overly used word in the book, but it used incorrectly the most times. It was so distracting to me that I had to stop reading to collect myself, and not in a good way!<br /><br />Trust me, it isn't not worth the money or time. If you want an easy to read, really not that great love story, read your Twilight books again. If you want an AWESOME BDSM series, go read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books.
B00RNRD7Y4|5|Okay, but just to spite North Korea, I have it 5 stars.
B00DUGCLY4|4|Fun game!
B00BAXFECK|3|Have you ever read a really well crafted book that left you unsure whether you liked it or not? So many plot turns and fantastical elements left me not knowing if it took place in the real world or some science fiction, warped reality, separate universe. The visual pictures painted by her words are stunning and really well done. Perhaps I've gotten lazy in my reading, but I finished the book (last night) and left feeling unfulfilled somehow.  I really cannot decide if it was great or not.  Perhaps I'll feel better about it tomorrow...
B00FMJJ064|5|I found Lindsey Stirling quite by accident. She is amazing. I have truly enjoyed listening to her playing. I am a teacher and this album is on my playlist that the students listen to. They have also enjoyed it. I can't help but to giggle when I see them tapping toes or bobbing heads to the music when she come on.
B0000B1OFL|5|The Italian Job is an awesome movie!  It's action-packed & is very clever.  I had a copy of the movie, but the disc got scratched, so I bought another copy to replace it.  It's one of the few movies you won't get tired of watching, even though you already know what's going to happen.
0439813786|5|Even though the vocabulary is hard for a fourth grader, he loves this book.  He read it twice.
B00L8O7KW8|5|Another great episode of THE 300!!! Understand this is part 2 . I didn't realize this was a multi-part series. That didn't change anything for me. Cinematography was insane--a sure bet in this franchise. Loved every minute. Hope you will too.
B00000IPAX|1|This CD is one of the best examples of what not to sound like if you study a musical instrument or are learning to sing. Of course, BLINK 182 does not do either, but that is just the reality of modern music. The masses have  accepted music made by so-called musicians that cannot sing or play  instruments well. However, I guess the masses have no choice much of the  time. Too bad, isn't it?
B008BQ8YHQ|5|I like this show for the same reasons that I despise attorneys.  They're manipulative and I have a hard time trusting them.  (It is altogether too bad that I have many attorneys as clients hehe)  I never know what is going to happen next which keeps me watching.  Since I don't have TV, thankfully, I rent episodes on Amazon.  Win-win for all.
034580404X|3|The writer is a hack.  Her main thrust is &#34;Ohhhh Christian, My poor, misunderstood man-child sadist lover&#34;!  Although it was on the best seller list for ages, I wouldn't recommend it altho I will be happy to lend the Trilogy to anyone who wants to read it!
B001PA0FF4|5|I try to make a point of seeing all the Oscar-nominated films and I saw all but one last year.  I very much enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire and fully expected it to win best picture. But I am convinced that Doubt was the best picture. A wonderful script with an outstanding cast giving exceptional performances.  As much as I thought The Reader was a film to give one pause for thought, Doubt is much more so. After seeing the film on Blue-ray and watching the extra features,  I noticed that John Patrick Shanley seemed to imply that he expected viewers to come away with differing views of the truth behind the events of the film. Well, that may be true, but I am convinced that there is only one reasonable way to view the events. So I do not think that Mr. Shanley's script leave as much room for Doubt as he perhaps wants. It is not enough to fail to provide definitive proof.  There must be plausible explanations for differing views. As I said, I don't think such explanations exist. I strongly recommend this film to any thinking adult.  I don't think that Blu-ray makes a big contribution to the enjoyment of this film.
0439023483|5|I finished this book at 2:00 am because I couldn't put it down. Fantastic. I wasn't sure at first- The Hunger Games starts out a little slow for my taste, and the main character, Katniss, seems a touch naive in the beginning. But once she enters the Hunger Games, hold on. Fast-paced action without seeming frantic, a solid story, and an emotionally complex character make this book unforgettable.  Although the main characters are young (12-16), the story is very adult. There is a lot of violence, though not terribly graphic. But what makes it so good is the emotional maturity. The author manages to balance the fears, worries, and self-examintation of the teenagers with their very real struggles to stay alive in a way that feels fresh and true.   I hate to give anything away, but I can't help comparing The Hunger Games with Stephen King's \\"The Long Walk\\"- something about the tone and the contest linked them in my mind. So if you are a fan of that story, you will love this book. I am ordering the second book in the series, and I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B0064MPXFA|5|I absolutely love this series. It keeps you coming back or more. It is hard to just watch one or two because it pulls you in. Great story line and the cast works wonderfully together!
B002BWP49C|5|Great Product
B00CWY76CC|4|game was fun and got more challenging as it went on but needs more levels. overall i would give it a 4 star review
B004FGMDOQ|5|I am glad I gave this book a chance after reading in the book description about levitating girls and invisible boys.  Not only did I enjoy this engaging adventure I also enjoyed the pictures the author has collected for his brilliant story!
B000OT8GCQ|5|Only someone who has experienced such a true love can be expected to understand the enormity of what it truly costs. This book shows the truth of such a love.
B00AL3OD7C|5|I loved this album growing up and it is still awesome. I used to have both the cassette and the album but the both disappeared a long time ago.
B00CS7ZIHI|5|This is a great album by a great band.  Pyres Of Varanasi is my favorite: recorded in India, a great homage to those who have been cremated in Varanasi.  Then you get the personal, raw feelings from Jared in City of Angels, telling his epic story and how he and Shannon got to where they are. It's no doubt taht Jared, Shannon, and Tomo always put out great music for their Echelon family and I am proud to be part of the Echelon.
B005OCFGTO|5|While you get more extended features, cover art and such with buying the films individually, this set gives you all the movies in one, easy to access collection. A must have for those that want to see all of the Harry Potter movies, whenever...
B00ENTDDGW|5|Very fun.
B007IXWL2C|2|It is entertaining but unreal the warped mind that he had from being abused.  Difficult if you would fall in love with someone such as this!

B001UFQNF0|3|This is probably the best toy Delorian made to date and I put the emphasis on TOY.<br />If you are buying this for a child, they will probably love it.<br />It's big enough to fit 3 3/4 inch action figures.<br />It has various sound and light effects.<br />The dash along with the flux capasitor inside the car light up which I think is a really good feature.<br />The Mr Fusion comes with the car but not in it. You have to install it.<br />Quite easy but also quite unnecessary.<br />There is no point in making it removable.<br />The movable wheels and opening doors give this car the charecter of the original.<br />A child could play with this for a while before getting bored.<br /><br />As a Collectors item DON'T CONSIDER THIS OVERSIZED CHEAP SUNSTAR RIPOFF.<br />At 1/15 scale this could be nothing but a childs toy.<br />Made of plastic<br />Poorly constructed, the hood or bonnet does not set in flush.<br />The lights only come on when you push the button.<br />It does not have a display lighting mode.<br />You cannot mute the sound and enjoy the light effects alone.<br />The detail in this model is So So,<br />There no Delorian name plate or logo found anywhere on the car which make it even more of a \\"bootleg\\" product.<br />This car feels light and flimsy.<br />The door panel and seats can and will pop out.<br />The wheel movement is sloppy.<br />The paint job is off, It does not look like steel.<br />Anything below 1/18 is toy territory so don't expect a model car collector to be able to appreciate this gigantic 1/15 size plastic toy delorian.<br />If Diamond Select had put display lights on a properly detailed standard 1:18 size diecast model without the annoying sound effects, They would have had a winner, but as it is, they made this \\"thing\\".<br />Sunstar and Welly are the model brands to have.<br />Diamond Select should stick with figure design and Entertainment Earth should find another product to put their \\"Exclusive\\" logo on.

B005LAJ1O0|5|If you're like me, your faith in horror television went out the window 3 eps in to season 2 of The Walking Dead.  Then, like a beacon of horror in a sea of cop shows: American Horror Story.  Inspired, witty writing. Beautiful sets and plenty of bloody flashbacks.  Surprise after shocking, horrifying, disturbing surprise.  VERY spoiler sensitive, BTW.  You'll be doing yourself a profound disservice if you watch the eps out of order.<br /><br />Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Denis O'Hare, and Dylan McDermott's naked butt round out a very large and impressive cast.  I can't say enough good things about it.  If you're a horror fan, you've really got to see this.
B006FE3FFC|5|This is a very good TV series and I'm looking forward to seeing next years release.  The acting and story line is excellent.
B00447L4JG|5|Arrived quickly.  The item was good condition.<br /><br />It was necessary to have this on hand on time for the student club.  The purpose was served.

B006LSZECO|3|Very bad ending! I kept saying this just dose not make any sense. Wish I had read more of the one star reviews!
B0064MPXFA|5|This is my new favorite show.  I haven't loved a t.v. series this much since The Gilmore Girls.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is awesome I build the most awesome buy this don't listen to the bad reviews buy this u wort regret it
B0000DJZA5|5|My parents own the original version on vinyl, and I did grow up with this album, being born in the 1970's.  I never really remembered the entire album, except for &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;Get Back&quot;.  I am a Beatles fan(who isn't), so when I was reading up on all the history behind this album, I figured, I would buy it and rediscover the Beatles, and I am glad I did.  Listening to Beatles music is so refreshing and rewarding, that you appreciate this music even more.  &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;, is in the simplest terms terrific.  &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot;, still sound excellent and remain the classics they should be, but then you have a song I completely forgot about &quot;Across The Universe&quot;, which sounds, so clear, so sharp, it's as if you are in the recording studio.  And I found a few new but old songs as favorites, like &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Dig A Pony&quot;, just to name a few, but the album as a whole is a treat.  And as for &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;(especially &quot;Let It Be&quot;) reminds me of my childhood and being part of my childhood, that's a great feeling and that is what music is supposed to do, take you back in time or away from the world, and that's what Beatles music does, it does whatever you want it to do.  My hope is that maybe one of these songs could see new life on the charts, but if not, the album as still amazing. There is nothing wrong with this album, in fact it's one of the best albums in my ENTIRE collection.  A++++++++ for one great album again.<br />1. &quot;Get Back&quot; A++++++<BR>2. &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; A+++++<BR>3. &quot;For You Blue&quot; A+++++<BR>4. &quot;Long And Winding Road&quot; A++++<BR>5. &quot;Two Of Us&quot; A+++++<BR>6. &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot; A+<BR>7. &quot;One After 909&quot; A++++<BR>8. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; A+++++++<BR>9. &quot;I Me Mine&quot; A+++++<BR>10. &quot;Across The Universe&quot; A+++++++++<BR>11. &quot;Let It Be&quot; A++++++++++++(one of the best songs ever)<br />Terrific...Terrific...Terrific, cannot say enough.
B00IMYSCR4|3|I don' understand why this movie won an award.  To me it could have been a made for TV movie
B007HACDLK|5|Thanks Vince for a great story.  Very timely and probably parallels the truth on many fronts.  Good description and dissemination of the Afghanistan problem.
B000G6R7B8|5|Informal but elegant design and appropriate for sport jacket and chinos
B00N35P5MW|4|Decent game.
B00005JMFO|5|My wife and I saw this at a preview last night and both loved it.  Since there are a lot of different stories going in, with characters crossing paths and interconnected in different ways, it took a few minutes to sort them all out.  <br />Once we did, though, it was worth it.  Most of the stories deal with some sort of romantic love (first love, lost love, unrequited love, etc.), but a few dealt with familial love or long-term friendship-type love.  Because of this, it sometimes felt uneven (Porky's crossed with You Can Count On Me), but on the whole was one of the funnier movies I've seen this year. <br />There were many moments that stuck with me on the ride home--I keep wanting to share them in this review, but they would spoil the surprises.  Also, loads of great performances from people I've never seen before--the kid who plays Liam Neeson's son Sam; the woman who plays Colin Firth's housekeeper Aurelia; the woman who plays Natalie, the Prime Minister's assistant; all were standouts in a very funny movie.
B0036T1RMM|5|Didn't like the movie very much but big Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan...
B006TF6WAM|4|Well written and interesting account of the heartache within everyday people, and the human capacity and will to rise above it.<br />Also interesting travel log through England.
B00P596I8Y|5|Go watch it already!
B001KZG99A|5|I rented this movie because it wasn't available on Netflix instant watch nor was it at redbox. I wanted to be ready for the 3rd Iron Man by having a &#34;Starks&#34; marathon. I was able to get by fix. :)
B006YXTRHY|5|Obvious this is a great movie. It's probably one of the most well known franchises of our time. You can't go wrong with twilight ;)
1101946342|5|I was so excited to read his story. At first i struggled Christian seemed too old boring almost, but then right around page 200 i loved his character. I liked that even though it was the same story it felt different. He questions himself alot &#34;for f**k sake grey&#34; but the more i read the more i understood his battle. The book puts a unique light into the story and i found myself wanting more. Great job e l james.
B00FVVR2ZO|5|A fun app to play. It helps to keep me occupied while on my down time. I do recommend this app to anyone who likes. Mystery type games.
B006QQCCOY|4|This movie was funny, I never saw it before. It was probably way better when it first came out, but it's still a decent movie.
B004ZZS4CC|3|I found the book- interesting- but, not really worth my time reading. I think the info could've been written in an informative magazine article w more impact tho. I don't want to sound harsh about dear J- - C she is incredibly strong and endured so much pain and torture as her family had. I just found the writing format boring in many areas. She has a story to tell- and I think her 'story' will be in the people she will ultimately help through her foundation she has started. I do feel by writing her story no doubt helped in her healing. She truly is an amazing young woman!
B0064MPXFA|3|it was just an oaky show, nothing new or exciting about it. I stopped watching after 3 parts, got really bored.
B00AKEMHCA|5|I got this game just because it was free on black Friday, but after giving it a try I'm addicted. It's one of the best tower defense games I've ever played.

0385738781|4|Happy to have a complete ending to the series.
B009NNMB70|3|I purchased this for my 10-year-old daughter 1D fan. She loves the movie and content is good. If you're a 1D fan, I'm sure you'll like it, so my review won't focus on that. However, a big part of the sales for this rather pricey 92-minute DVD is the digital copy. Well, guess what, there are only 3 (i.e., 48) &#34;simple&#34; steps to get your UltraViolet copy. You have to go to the SonyPictures website, enter your redemption code. Then, if you don't have a login, you have to create one, and give intimate details of your past, promise your next-born, etc. Then, finally, you have access to your movie. And.... if you have a tablet (maybe other than a Sony brand), you're still probably out of luck. My daughter wanted to download this on her Kindle Fire, for use away from home on car rides. You have to install Microsoft Silverlight as the next &#34;easy&#34; step - which you cannot do on a Kindle Fire. We then tried my husband's iPad.<br /><br />Bottom line, digital copy will not stream nor download on a Kindle Fire. It will stream, but not download on a iPad. Looks like you can view the digital content if you are sitting at a computer with an internet connection. Nice, real nice for kids....<br /><br />We have purchased other movies (such as Madagascar 3), which was easily loaded to a Kindle Fire for offline use - worked easily and flawlessly. This is disappointing. If &#34;This Is Us&#34; was marketed as just the DVD (or Blu-ray) and priced as such, I wouldn't complain. But to advertise digital copy which is VERY limited in utility is simply irritating.
B00FJTYDKK|3|It was entertaining. I've seen better, the caveman ignorance got a little played, but it's funny and holds my kid's attention.
0761163808|5|It's a great concept and my little guy loves looking at the animals in motion!! Definitely would for young or older kids!!
B004RJMUJO|5|little brother loves this. Now he'll do the chores if I let him play :)
B000WPAG1Q|5|Christina is on top of her game. The stage show is elaborate, the band is comprised of top musicians, and her voice is in fine form. VERY impressive concert and it shows that she just keeps on getting better and better. I like the Back to Basics theme, gives her more of an outlet to really show off her great vocal range, much more so than her last album, Stripped. Anyways, this dvd is definitely enjoyable and a must have for Christina fans.
B004UID2LC|5|ok
0739368435|5|From the audio book CD version - Unabridged.  Readers:  Dewidan, Landor, Lee, and Mills<br /><br />There might not be a better version of this story than the one that is told by: Susan Dewidan, Roselyn Landor, John Lee and Juliet Mills.  It is not often that I will recommend an audio book over the hard copy, but in this case I am making an exception.  I could not read the book to myself in any manner that would enhance this version of the telling of Guernsey Literary Society.<br /><br />The Channel Islands were overrun by the Germans early in WWII as the Germans were attempting to make a bid for the British Isles.  They re-enforced the hills overlooking the beaches with slave labor that had been captured from Europe.  The Germans nearly starved the population that remained on the island of Guernsey by confiscating their animals, and farm produce.  It was a difficult time and by using letters from the survivors to a caring and empathic author from London, Shaffer and Barrows unfold a fascinating story of survival, hardship, friendship and how the pivotal \\"book\\" saved their sanity.<br /><br />Mixed in is a beautifully told romance and existing friendships that pull the reader into the story and at the same time deepen the characters a little at a time.  I keep reading to find this type of story.  While there is quite a bit of romantic \\"chick lit\\" especially near the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  I don't know if I would give the book a 5 star rating, but this audio book version will be rated as a 5 star - it is that good.
B006ZAZ31U|5|Man where do I start!!! If you like awesome books, want to get a peek at the Tier One world, or just simply want some motivation get this book!!!! Adam Brown shows that you can go rock bottom and rise all the way to the top!!!!! He goes from a drug addict to one of the deadliest warriors on the planet!!!!! This book also shows you how hard it can be on your family and really how much these warriors sacrifice! There is so much detail of his last mission that you can start to picture it so vividly. I loved this one for sure!
0399171541|4|Interesting stuff from my maybe cousin.  Most intriguing are behind the scenes looks at &#34;The Smiths&#34; and Morrissey's rough childhood; schooling straight out of Pink Floyd's &#34;The Wall&#34;!

0671027573|5|This book is really great. Presently, I'm re-reading it (my 3rd time) while looking for another Linda Howard book. Jaine &amp; Sam are so witty, funny &amp; lovable. I enjoyed their exhange of repartee. As the story unfolds, I was kept on the edge wondering who the killer is &amp; who among the other girls will be the next, while awaiting for a moment when Jaine &amp; Sam reveal their feelings for each other. Only Linda can create that kind of mixture of humour, suspense, romance &amp; excitement. You'll never go wrong when you choose a Linda Howard book. I'm looking forward to reading another one.

B002KJX4IE|4|When this movie came out; the aftermarket was way over hyped and the cartoon follow on was only marginal.<br />But this remains an entertaining movie.
B0062O58F0|3|The movie itself is an easy 5 star. The reason I gave 3 star is as a word of caution to potential future buyers.<br />Only the 3D title is region free. Regular blu-ray and bonus features are region B only (Europe, Greenland, French territories, Australia, New Zealand and few other places that could care less about DRM).<br /><br />If I had known this, I wouldn't have made the purchase as you pay for all 3 discs, whether you can use them or not.<br />The bright side is that I do own a 3D TV, so at least I didn't dump my hard earned money into a black hole.<br /><br />After I've received the blu-ray and I was unable to play it, I went to the merchant's page I found the following disclaimer:<br /><br />1. The feature film on 100% of our titles will play in North American Blu-ray and PS3 players. (False, regular blu-ray and bonus features are B region only)<br />2. Special Features on our titles may or may not be region-free (While bonus dvd might be considered bonus feature, blu-ray movie isn't - whether they say it is or not. Either way, if I pay for it I should be able to play it, at least in my primary region.)<br />3. We guarantee that the main film on 100% of the Blu-ray discs that ship will be Region-Free. Any accessory DVDs enclosed with the movie may or may not be Region-Free. (Fine, but don't sell Region B products for the full price to Region A customers).<br /><br />This disclaimer needs to be on the product page, not the merchant page. In addition, they need to specify region code for which the region exclusive content is for. Otherwise, there is no way for the customer to know that they are actually making a purchase on.<br />It is a deliberately deceptive tactic and is a scam in my opinion.<br /><br />I've talked to Amazon customer support and they were amazing as usual (should have parked that amazing.com domain/brand).<br />They have issued a full refund and I am happy about that. I have shared this story with their customer support and was promissed that it will be passed along the chain.<br />I would love to see this merchant either disclose this info on the product page and inform the customer before the purchase is made and time is wasted, or this merchant removed from the marketplace.<br />In case none of these two happen, I hope future customers get to read this review before they get into this frustrating situation.at it will be passed along the chain.<br />I would love to see this merchant either disclose this info on the product page and inform the customer before the purchase is made and time is wasted, or this merchant removed from the marketplace.<br />In case none of these two happen, I hope future customers get to read this review before they get into this frustrating situation.

0307887898|3|The writer puts together a good book. If you are in the high-tech or software biz, probably a lot of good info. For a main street entrepreneur this book is not of as much use.<br /><br />Many traditional businesses simply do not have the ability to test and constantly adjust their \\"product\\" or \\"service\\". We are out here in real world, not inventing products, but instead working in a particular field, with well defined products and services.<br /><br />Certainly there is room for creativity and measurement, but not the way software can be tested and users tracked.<br /><br />I have read several recent business books with a similar specific industry slant, by big name authors, that offer little practical help to what I would call traditional entrepreneurs. We are 1, 2 or 3 person operations with little margin for error and need practical help attracting customers to a new concern utilizing current marketing trends and tools.<br /><br />The book was a good read for he most part, but got bogged down in the middle with too much detail that was of no use.
B00SCFLMMU|5|In Siczak's novel, paradox is a statement or proposition that seems contradictory or absurd but expresses the possibility of truth. Angels are messengers who convey God's will...sent to guide and protect us. An apparition is the inexplicable appearance of a ghost, a spirit, entity or a demon.  Visions, premonitions, prophecies and inexplicable phenomena unify this exploration of the infinite as a team of Paranormal Researchers, an Association for the Scientific Research of Phenomena and a group of Quantum Physicists both search for answers in the Bermuda Triangle as a rash of inexplicable events begin occurring worldwide.<br /><br />A complex paranormal novel.

B008RV5K5E|4|I have to say that I was surprised that Peter Weller was doing the voice for Batman in this movie, but he fit the part well, and the movie itself was pretty good. I am actually looking forward to seeing part 2, partly because of his gruff voice continuing on as Batman. For any Batman fan out there, this is worth buying.

0446310786|5|When I first decided I was going to read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for an English assignment, I got mixed reviews from my peers. My best friend told me she disliked it, but my English teacher and another friend in my class told me it was a great book and I would enjoy it. I didn't know what exactly to expect until I started reading it. <br /> <br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a wonderful story that greatly portrays childhood innocence and insight in a conflicted society that existed down South in the 1930's. Scout Finch, the young girl who narrates the story, is a truly convincing and lovable character. She takes you on a journey through Maycomb, Alabama, her home town, where her views of morality and good and evil are tested by what happens over the course of a year. The views and attitudes of the townsfolk and the other colorful characters that are encountered throughout the course of the novel are unique and completely believable. Maycomb could have been a real town that existed in America. <br /> <br />I would recommend \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" to anyone who hasn't read it, even my own peers. It is that moving of a book, and I will read it again when I get the chance to. <br /> <br />- Brittany Treichel, 17

1416594795|5|This is an excellent review of the categories of evidence for how life on earth has changed over time.  There is little good reason to argue with the facts of history but still our understanding of how changes occurs is incomplete.  Dawkins spends too much time directly refuting creationists--is just isn't worth it.  They won't read the book or listen to facts either.  For those who want a good model of evolution to carry in their heads, this is a good book.
B00007KWHG|5|The fabulously successful musical \\"Jersey Boys\\" transported us 35 years back in time. We immediately bought the real group's CD from Amazon and we play it three times a day. It invigorates us. They are even grander than we remembered them in our youth. Knowing the backstory from the play, we appreciate the music all the more. What a trip, what a night!
B00IXHBZF6|5|Awesome legendary album!
B00KA7JIII|3|Nice game,but way to short. If it was 4x longer I would give it 4.5 stars.

B00000F14B|5|I was a kid when i first saw Robert Preston on Broadway.  When i heard he was also going to do the movie i was even more excited. What a wonderful actor.  Now we are blessed with the DVD version which is equally as stunning in scope and grandur.When this reopened on Broadway i saw it again and the actor that played Harold Hill was stunning.  He even looked like Robert Preston and if you close your eyes you would swear it was his voice too.By all means buy this Warner Brothers musical. They did a wonderful job and is almost word for word of the Broadway versions which usually is never the case. This is talent at it's very best and of course Shirly Jones is outstanding. She has graced so many of our classic musicals with total style. EXCELLENT!

B008220C56|5|I've read the book many many years ago and I loved it - I have seen the movie with Vivien Leigh as Anna Karenina and loved it and at first watching this rather unorthodox rendering of this love drama with Keira Knightly was taken aback. I instantly enjoyed the cinematagrophy, the music, the ballet scenes but I initially didn' get drawn into the story emotionally. However, that changed midway through the movie and then I didn't want the movie to end.<br /><br />I can understand that not everyone feels the same way but to me it was just a most artistic version, beautifully acted and even more beautifully photographed. Am looking forward to watching it again and again!
B0053TMP24|5|The big question that this book answers that the Lost Hero left is, What happened to Percy Jackson? In this book Percy Jackson returns as one of the main characters. At the beginning of the book you find Percy Jackson stripped of his memories and being hunted by gorgons. As he is trying to escape them he encounters Juno in the form of an old lady who gives him a choice. He can go to the sea and be guaranteed safety as the world gets destroyed, or he can regain his memories and save the gods by going to the roman half-blood camp, Camp Jupiter.<br />Percy's decision to go to the Roman camp becomes a launching point to introduce new Roman demigods and starting a new quest. Camp Jupiter it's self is just amazing; it's full of Lares (house gods) and is divided into legions like the Roman army and introduces the differences between the Roman and the Greek culture and mythology.<br />In Camp Jupiter we are introduced to new characters. The most striking and important one (I think) is Hazel Levesque, Daughter of Pluto. She has the ability to bring up gold and other precious metals or gems but the people who find them become cursed. Another key character is Frank Zhang, son of Mars, who has amazing archery skills and the ability to change into different animals. The three of them are soon sent on a quest by Mars himself to free Thanatos, the guardian of the underworld, who has been captured by a giant.<br />The Son of Neptune picks up most of the key threads that were started in The Lost Hero. We also get some hints about the prophesy of seven and also what is to come in the next book. We also learn more about Gaea's plans to destroy the world and the god's and how the half-bloods must stop her.<br />I really like how the author manages to get just the right mix of action, and slower paced times through out the story. I also like how he use's the third person narrative and how he switches back and forth between Percy, Hazel, and Frank's perspectives. It feels more mature than the first person narrative in the Percy Jackson series. This style also helps you connect with the characters more and also helps you feel and see what they see.n the first person narrative in the Percy Jackson series. This style also helps you connect with the characters more and also helps you feel and see what they see.
0670024783|5|I started this book last night and couldn't put it down until I finished it.  This would make a good movie, Oprah, if you read these reviews.  Sad and enlightening but a wonderful testament to the will to survive. I did not know there would be actual historical figures and events written into the story, but once the Grimke sisters came up, Lucretia Mott, the slave uprisings in the 1820s, I knew we were going to have a bit of history, which made the book even better. Recommend highly.

B005J0VPNC|3|Neat effects, seems resource intensive on my Galaxy S, seems to have locked up my phone after taking several pictures. Uploaded some fun \\"Take on Me\\" style photos on Facebook.  Got it as a free app of the day, I'd have been very disappointed otherwise, because of a weird side effect; another, non-phone application (Medscape!?) keeps trying to launch when I take a picture.  The lockup and app launching cost it more stars.

B0099G3I96|5|As a long time No Doubt fan I will most likely love anything they do. But if something is bad, I can admit that too. But this is GOOD! You can feel the older ND swag, mixed in with this new, fresh, mature album. Push and Shove, and Settle Down proves they can still kick our asses. But they don't really need to prove anything. Gwens vocals are mesmerizing in some of the slower songs. Such good stuff. Its really exciting to be able to follow a bands career, and see them evolve. So buy  this album, and enjoy the journey.

B00004NJKW|3|Standing on the Shoulder of Giants being Oasis 3rd studio album and their 2000 release is an ok album but not nearly as good as either of their prior albums and especially if one compares it with their magnum opus \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\". Still there are some pretty good tracks, \\"Who Feels Love?\\" , \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" and \\"Go Let It Out\\" . The booklet is ok with easy to read lyrics, a list of additional muisicans and a collage of strange photos seemingly shot at random. 3/5.

6305807086|5|This movie rules!  It has everything...<br />A director. (Spike Jonze) A cast. (A lot of people) A crew. (Even more people) A background. (Inside John Malkovich)<br />It has good comedy, and ideas.<br />Just the idea of going  inside somebody and looking through them is awesome! <br />Get this movie!

B007J4T2G8|2|As romance novels go, this one wasn't all I was expecting.  I had heard rave reviews and was frankly disappointed...especially with the ending.  Maybe that was a way to get people to buy the follow ups, but if the others are like this, I really don't want to waste my money.
B000BYA5GO|5|This is what happens when you create a fight, but won't accept responsibility for your actions. Nicolas Cage plays a gunrunner who will sell any weapon to anyone-all under the table so that the major arms selling countries like the US have plausible denial when wars begin. This movie works on many levels, as a tale of misbegotten fortune, a political thriller, and action, action, action. Some humor too. Well rounded, reality-based and attracive, this is a super buy.
B008Y7N7JW|5|To me it is a  very excellent movie that is well made in such a way that it keeps you watching to see what is going to happen next and to whom it will happen. Well worth watching.
B00VRYCGLO|4|I like the the game but the only problem that I found with it was the lives. It would say that I would get a life in 5 minutes and when I went back to the game an hour later it would still say I had to wait for 5 minutes for a life.
0385504225|3|It does not take very many pages of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to realize you have experienced this plot before.   Much of it is like \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" with some \\"National Treasure\\" included. Robert Langdon seems to be unable to  escape from the \\"Groundhog Day\\" nature of his life. He keeps doing the same things, with a few new faces, and a different location.     This book deals with the Masons, and their secrets. Langdon, of course, is wise and intelligent. He understands that  everyone is a bit odd, and if you get in the other fellow's shoes, you can understand what he holds sacred.   Not a bad philosophy, really, if its applied wisely.  You have to give Dan Brown credit for tolerance.     The first half of the book is best.  The plot holds together fairly well until the last half of the book. Then, it spins out of control, and becomes much less enjoyable.  Still, it held me, and made me want to see how it would end.     I always marvel at the incredible energy of Dan Brown's characters. Their adventures take place in a very short period of time. They suffer terror, hot pursuits, and the constant need to elude villains and the law.  While doing this, they do not, apparently, need to go to the bathroom, eat, or fall asleep.    I got a chuckle at the end when one of the characters---Peter Solomon----who has had his hand cut off, and has been at death's door, suddenly finds the energy to drive Langdon around Washington D.C. in an SUV.  It is an amazing example of healing.     And I must add one more thing. Once again, Langdon is the king of platonic relationships. The girl is his, or could be, but he lets her go. One cannot help but wish that when it is all over, Langdon would do something with the girl.   Hey, after what he has been through, he, and the reader, deserve it.     The villain is a truly awful fellow, and his identity is hidden until the end of the novel. His reptilian nature, and  creepy ways are quite engaging. He is a guy you love to hate, and you would behorrified to meet him.    Its not a great book, but it is readable diversion. I had fun with it, and it kept me wanting to learn how it would end.   You can do worse than that.

061301328X|5|The most interesting book I've read in the last thirty years! It combines romance, adventures, crime, treason, loyalty, costumes, habits, religion, cultural differences and languages difficulties in a more than thousand pages of wonderful storytelling! The biggest problem is how to close it to sleep, sometimes we see the hours go by and just can't stop reading...

0307887448|5|One of the best books incorporating the vintage computer game era.  I couldn't put this book down, the storyline was original and creative.  The dialogues were captivating and I really enjoyed how the author manages to warn about the dangers of being sucked entirely into a virtual reality.  To keep it short, if you like Atari games and pop culture, read this book.  No ifs, ands, or buts.

B008KH8X2C|4|Rory Gallagher's Against the Grain is the last Rory Gallagher album I'm listening to for a while.  I cleared out everything the man did (well, the official albums anyway) from his self-titled debut through Calling Card.  &#34;All Around Man&#34; has soaring guitar soloing in the beginning before quickly settling into a slow-moving blues groove.  The keyboard solo soon after is probably the high point of this song as the blues riff continues playing quietly in the background.  Gotta love the slide guitar solo that comes after however it's not quite as good as usual.  I'm not sure why that is.  Probably because this song feels a little rushed based on the lack of inspirational guitar playing and a fairly bland short vocal melody (by Rory's usual high standards it falls short I mean).  However when the keyboards return the song improves.  Even the lyrics aren't up to par.  &#34;Just step inside my rocket ship, I'll take you circling around the sun&#34;.  &#34;Souped-Up Ford&#34; is more like it!  Molly Hatchet-like fast moving rhythm work, explosive guitar playing, Rory singing outrageously, and more!  I like the &#34;I'm on my way and I can't stay, make no mistake I'm pulling out today&#34; line while the slide guitar moves along.  This is classic Rory Gallagher.  What a great song!  Given the level of excitement and the lyrics about leaving town, this is the perfect song to play when you just want to get away from everything and start over.  I have a new attitude darn it!  Time for some change.  Even the keyboard jam continues the furious pace.  Memorable solo too.  &#34;I won't be free 'till I get up and go where my heart is&#34; contains a WONDERFUL melody!  Nobody's stopping Rory from moving on.  Then another really powerful slide guitar solo at the end.  Awesome song!  &#34;Let Me In&#34; is all about loud hard rock.  I like the way Rory sings the line &#34;I could be wrong and I could be right, you're gonna keep me waiting all night&#34; but truthfully this is pretty standard hard rock.  It doesn't do anything different from most artists however it works showing off Rory having a lot of fun singing.  Even the guitar solo, while decent, doesn't go the extra mile in flooring me like Rory usually does.  &#34;Cross Me Off Your List&#34; shows a slower jazzier side of Rory.  Hmmm, this melody isn't very good I'm afraid.  Why is that you ask?  Well Rory's singing along with the guitar line and it sounds like it's done note for note, but perhaps I'm wrong.  Who cares though, because the guitar playing is good.  Every so often I hear a similarity between Blue Oyster Cult's style of guitar soloing and Rory's.  I hear a slight similarity here in this one.  This particular solo is probably better than most of BOC's, granted.  Anyway amazing guitar solo at the end.  &#34;Lost at Sea&#34; starts off on a softer note with a simple melody reminding one of sailing across an ocean while moments of Rory's heavier style of guitar soloing reveals itself in between.  I like the line &#34;Raise the sails and leave, take me straight home, I can almost see the distant shoreline&#34; in the middle because it sounds very beautiful.  You'd have to be crazy to not love the guitar solo at the end.  It makes me think of a sailor sailing off for the very last time.  So gorgeous.  &#34;I Take What I Want&#34; is a cover of the Hollies classic turned into hard rock of course, because it'd be awkward if it was covered in any other way!  I prefer the Hollies version because it's impossible to beat those harmonies, but this version has a really memorable keyboard and guitar solo in the middle.  I actually don't know who wrote the original version but Hollies still win!  &#34;Out on the Western Plain&#34; is a western cowboy song in the same style as Bon Jovi's &#34;Dead or Alive&#34; but a LOT better than the Bon Jovi song (and you know, I actually like the Bon Jovi song too).  This is something significantly more meaningful though.  The way Rory does it sounds grittier and more authentic than most.  The acoustic guitar is really dark here.  Some of Rory's vocals are strange here (&#34; Cow cow yicky, yicky yay!&#34;).  The slide guitar appearing in a few spots is quite cool.  This is a great song seriously.  &#34;Bought and Sold&#34; has a GREAT rhythm!  The vocals are really catchy as a result.  &#34;You think you've got it made, you think you've got my number, you better check again, I don't intend to stay here&#34; is just SO catchy!  Rory's guitar solo afterwards keeps the momentum in fine order.  &#34;At the Bottom&#34; sounds like southern rock which is pretty awesome considering Rory's Irish.  The vocal melody however is about the opposite of American as can be.  It's really sincere and beautiful.  &#34;It took time to come and make you see, life ain't what it appears to be, it's the luck of the draw and the old spinning wheel, like a message in a bottle&#34; is a great line not so much for the lyrics but the way Rory sings it.  &#34;Watching the sky with tears in my eyes I feel so lonely, I'm flying by for I try to smile but it's not easy&#34; IS however, a great line.  Well if *this* is what life is like at the bottom, with Rory singing beautifully... hey take me there right now, haha.  &#34;Ain't Too Good&#34; has a pretty simple melody a lot like &#34;Lost at Sea&#34; but perhaps even lonelier.  Some interesting (and brief) guitar tricks after the vocal melody is over the first time.  The loneliness continues with a really melodic guitar solo.  The lyric &#34;Well it ain't too late to change your mind, well it's time you knew just where I stand, well let me know 'cuz I got plans&#34; makes me think Rory was going through some kind of depression.  Unless this is a cover song then it would just be Rory being good at expressing emotions convincingly.  How about the guitar solo at the end?  Yes it's enough to make even the hardest of men cry.  There's a couple bonus tracks.  They're both really short.  &#34;Cluney Blues&#34; doesn't fulfill much only being 2 minutes, but it's a wonderful example of authentic blues in the guitar/piano.  To think, if someone handed me a guitar and asked me to play something like this I'd have a lot of trouble doing so since I have no experience with guitar playing, but Rory... he could probably play a song like this in his sleep!  &#34;My Baby, Sure&#34; is country rock.  &#34;I'm going to write myself a letter, I'm going to send it in the mail&#34; sounds familiar so this is undoubtedly a cover of a famous country tune but I wouldn't know who did the original or more familiar version.  I love this song, especially the piano solo at the end.  Overall, not sure why I think less of Against the Grain compared to all the other Rory Gallagher albums between 1971-1976, but well, I do.  It's *still* a recommendable album though because Rory excels at bringing out the best in extraordinary guitar keyboard soloing, blues, jazz and hard rock.  Considering Rory was doing this stuff in the 70's when such a genre was at the top of its game, well you can't go wrong!  Great album either way.
B00BAXFECK|5|Towards the end I couldn't put this book down. It was a ride like no other. You might have no idea where the protagonist is taking you, but such is life.
0439023521|3|This book was ok I know this is aimed toward kids/teens. Im in my 20s and read it, first I will say to all the parents out there the violence in this book is crazy sort of like a horror type stuff..goes into details.. I would not let a kid read it, its disturbing imo. If you care what your kid reads might want to pass on this, if you dont care  skip this warning.  The book was ok imo, I feel like the story is tooooooooooooo long when it shouldnt have to be in this case, I did get into it tho..I kept wondering whats going to happen next. I did get bored towards the end of the book (since its not and ending story) I did not enjoy all the Graphic violence/gore...   so heres my thoughts on the book the start was cute, the middle was creepy, and the end just was flat.  I know I can buy another book to continue but the ending didnt grip me so I dont care for it.
0375851569|5|I bought this collection for my 3 year-old nephew and he loves it so much. when I visited my sister, everyday my nephew used to pick one of the books and ask me to read it to him and it was so much fun I used to read the first part of the sentence and he completed it from his memory.<br />absolutely recommended!
0767802659|4|This is a pretty good movie, it's exciting, easy on the eyes and has a decent plot.  It's based loosely on the book although the movie can't really decide whether it wants to be inspiring like the book or a satire on war.  Some reviewers have suggested that the book is like this which I completely disagree with.  In my opinion this movie turned out a lot like director Verhoeven's Total Recall -- it started out as a serious, intellectual movie but as work on the movie progressed, the special effects took over and the acting [was bad], so they made it seem like they meant to do that.  And like Total Recall, they pulled it off.  Overall it's a decent flick but completely different in tone and purpose than the book.
1439102937|2|Disappointing. Very selfish characters-did not care what happened to them, truly disliked 2 of the 3 characters.
B0019N8P2W|3|The release of \\"DARIA\\" on DVD is a mixed blessing: on one hand, it's a long-overdue release of a genuinely excellent series (that I continued to watch weekly even AFTER graduating high school); on the other, its also a painfully truncated version of it that kinda ruins the nostalgia for those of us who remember it differently (with the VHS evidence to prove it).    THE GOOD NEWS: the boxed set allows for complete viewing.  It's very easy to catch up or completely introduce yourself to the series if you were too young the first time around.  And you get to see all five years at once rather than scrounging around for multiple seasons.  I suppose it is better for the show to be available and doctored than to be unavailable at all, since the characters and writing were the key to its power.    AND we get the Pilot episode, which is nice.    THE BAD NEWS: Well, let's start with the music: we all knew that the original music was never going to be included; no one at Viacom will spend the money for licensing on every episode, and until a wealthy fan does so on their own dime, it'll be a dream unrealized.  But the generic music is kinda hard to deal with because sometimes its louder than the dialogue in the scene, or doesn't fit at all.  Also, the Splendora theme song for the opening titles is a different recording than the original broadcast and can be a bit annoying, although some of the Splendora cues made specifically for the movies are still intact.  The music situation is probably only going to hurt purists like me who remember the show from the first time around.    Here are some others, some big, others just nitpicky:    - The second movie/last episode \\"IS IT COLLEGE YET?\\" is the censored Noggin-channel version.  While I've resigned myself to the music problems, this one is inexcusable; MTV owns the series, it should have the original print somewhere.    - The special features are a joke.  Again, due to music issues, the specials \\"Look Back in Annoyance\\" and \\"Behindthe Scenes at Daria\\" are absent, and the retrospective is painfully short, with snippets of interviews rather than actual ones.  Also absent are any TV spots for music (like the Garbage promo from \\"IS IT FALL YET?\\").  However, the animated sections from an MTV video countdown are included, though not the videos themselves.    - The show is in order but with no season dividers; you have to research which episodes were in which season.    - The early episodes are a bit faded; they aren't damaged, but the color isn't as sharp as the later episodes.    - Closed Captioning but no subtitles.    - The movies are shoved on the extras disc, not given context as to which seasons they capped off (video quality is SLIGHTLY inferior as a result).      So overall, the collection isn't a waste for those who want to experience the show as a whole and not as a time capsule.  For those who want the show in its entirety uncut and unaltered...we still have our VHS collections.  But while some things were unavoidable due to rather large legal issues (the music), other things that were entirely solvable (uncut versions, picture quality, etc.), make this an underwhelming accomplishment.  Considering how well the \\"AEON FLUX\\" boxed set turned out, and how terrible the \\"BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD\\" boxed sets turned out, this one falls in between: neither as good or as bad as it COULD have been.  Three stars is being generous.    Regardless, I would suggest waiting for sales or markdowns to buy it; at the current price it isn't worth it.

I am 80 percent into this book and I have to say that I am disappointed.  Chris Kyle comes off as very arrogant and I bit of a trouble maker.  He makes all SEALS seem the same in his description of them.  20 percent to go in the book, and I hope this changes a bit.  As of now, I would not recommend this as you will be a bit disappointed if you liked the movie.

B00729GQ0A|4|After reading the Twilight saga it was difficult to find books as much enthralling...I first found Fae Fever Series (a long time ago) and then I found Rebecca Hamilton on twitter. It is my favorite book now!!! At first I was very disapointed because he was exclusive to Amazon. I bought a Kindle Fire from ebay and the first book I bought was the Forever Girl. I was very pleasantly surprise!!! First of all she camp her characters in a totally normal town with normal life, then her principal  character, Sophia, begin to experience some really weird things in her life. And then new people are introduce and we then discover a totally new paranormal and addictive world. Ya I said addictive cuz, after that you wouldn't want to return to you're average boring life...more now that Charles is in you're life! There's new power never experience with those kind of character and a paranormal world well craft! And where missing just enough information to keep us hooked and waiting for a second book. Suffice to say, in a few word, this book is smoking hot, refreshing, paranormal, addicting, fantastic (or fangtastic...it depends!!! =P), romantic, unexpected, mysterious and I could go on and on like that. So a few words can't describe it since Rebecca and her book is so awsome!!! Now I can't wait to read her next one!

B00DR0PDNE|5|PROS:<br />I opened the package at 8 pm and by 8:25, I was watching the first YouTube video on it. Super simple, and very impressive.<br /><br />Installing the free Google Cast app lets you use additional tools in the Chromecast-enabled application (like YouTube and Netflix).<br /><br />CONS (very minor):<br />I was surprised a bit by how long it took to send the first 45-minute video to the device (much longer than simply watching it on my Chromebook), but the difference is that everyone in the room (5 of us) could watch it in equal comfort. That may have been &#34;priming the pump&#34;, however, because subsequent videos took seconds to &#34;spool up&#34; on the Chromecast.<br /><br />While the video was playing via Chromecast, I could not access any network apps on my Chromebook.

B00B4VXQC8|4|While this isn't the 80's Bon Jovi, which is my favorite, it isn't really bad either.  I agree it is way more mellow than I thought it would be but after listening to it repeatedly in my car, it's starting to grow on me & I'm liking more songs, there are about two of them I almost always skip over, but with any new music I always have to listen a few times before actually liking it. This definately would not be one of my favorite albums out of the newer ones he has, that would be Have A Nice Day, but I'm not going to harshly criticize it either like some people.  Bon Jovi always has & always will be my favorite band, I just think maybe next time they should consult the old \\"pizza pie jury\\" like they did for Slippery When Wet, which obviously worked!  That way the public picks the songs, what they want to hear, and no one can complain!  Yeah, right!

B002VECM4A|5|As a middle class white dude, Precious is the last sort of movie I ever thought I'd want to watch, much less rave about. But for some reason, even before all the Oscar season hype, it caught my attention. Having missed it in theaters on account of nobody wanting to go with me, I blindly bought the DVD and was extremely impressed with the actors' performances and the handling of subject matters related to sex, incest, HIV, poverty, and abuse.<br /><br />Several other reviews have outlined the plot pretty thoroughly so I won't rehash it all here, but I will emphasize that Precious is not so much a linear story, with a clear cut beginning and end, as it is just a glimpse into the life of a young girl who is coming to realize she wants (and deserves) something more. I cannot praise Gabourey Sidibe enough for taking on such a gritty role with virtually no professional experience, and of course Mo'Nique is wonderful, if not horrifying, as well. Very powerful performances from both women. Even Mariah Carey, who I absolutely detest as a singer, was not only competent, but likeable in this film, as was the underrated Paula Patton. Every facial expression and every bodily movement was meaningful, yet came out naturally. I haven't seen a movie this well cast in a long time.<br /><br />I guess I can't really add anything that hasn't been mentioned many times over already, but I just wanted to throw out one more 5 star review because I think it was an all around well-made movie, and even though I personally can't relate to any aspects of it in my own life on any level, I found myself somehow connected to the characters and emotionally touched. You really can tell that the actors and production crew submerged themselves completely in this story and it draws the viewer in. Plus I think it's totally ridiculous how some people give it one star reviews just for the fact that it's depressing, which is true, but subject matter has no bearing on cinematography.<br /><br />DVD extras are pretty standard, though I would have liked to have heard more from Gabby since she seems like an awesome and grounded young lady in real life. All the best to her.I would have liked to have heard more from Gabby since she seems like an awesome and grounded young lady in real life. All the best to her.

B001GAPC1K|4|So, this was the movie that begun the summer season on 2008 and boy, it started with a bang. Iron Man collected more than 300 million USD just in North America and was praides almost universally.    And with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X-Men. Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.    Directed in a very fresh way by Jon Favreau, Iron Man is a movie that took a very serious approach (serious, not dark) to it´s source material. Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity. he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.     the other members of the cast do ggod jobs from what they have to work, but from the script, they are secondary to Stark, who fills the screen for 95% of the film.    I belive that the reviews should be done at the moment of the first seeing, (to measure first impact) and also after several viewings, because you can discover new details every watch, and after 5 or 6 times, a whole different picture might emerge. i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect. Tha main problem with the film is the lack of an enemy that is in the same tone with the rest of the film, very similar to what hurted Batman Begins: in the last portion of the film, the to-that-moment-realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super-villain Mountain. I think that with a more serious and realistic nemesis, Iron Man could be in the League of The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2 or X Men 2 as the best the genere has to offer.    Anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order...just see the top ten box-office movies, andcount how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.
0345803485|5|i loved this book and then borrowed the other two books from a friend. This is a book you won't put down. Can't wait for the movie. Though my imagination is much better than a movie could be.

B005D9MUWY|5|Great app, gladly paid for it. My time spent texting has gone down and the more I do text the more it learns and predicts what I'm going to say next
B000SVZIDA|4|quirky but okay
B0071XO8RA|4|I bought this Kindle book based on the posted reviews for it.  And they were right.  It is a very entertaining read.  Reminds me of early Silverberg.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00F35BV64|3|This movie was ok, but did not follow the real history of Star Trek.<br />Any fan knows that Christopher Pike did not die but went to another planet with Spock's help.  I think that it was a poor choice not to follow the history.  They could have had any old friend of Capt Kirk's die in the attack on Star Fleet and it would have had the same effect.
B00992CF6W|1|Seriously the game I purchased 3 times with 6.99 each with tax.It needs updates.I am sure block launcher pro does not work and I can not get mods on my Middlefield.Plus I can't play the hunger games for the kindle fire hd.I really want to play.I confirm it sucks
B004WDRT1Y|3|the effects of the 3d was disappointing.The 3d was only noticeble in some of the film.....don't know what else to say

B00H1UK3UO|5|Every so often, alas, not often enough, an author comes along whose writing is far superior to the drivel that is printed in our era of self-printing.  Burton is such a writer. She is not only a talented writer but a writer who can create original characters and a fascinating plot. From the opening pages of &#34;The Miniaturist&#34; to its closing, the reader is caught up in a story that unfolds as part mystery, part fantasy, and part coming of age. The main character, a young woman in an arranged marriage begins her married life in late 17th century Amsterdam, a city of enormous wealth. Its citizens are torn between covetousnes and the horrific Calvanistic prejudices practiced by the city fathers and condoned by the church.  Gorgeous prose and engaging characters kept me glued to the book despite the slightly off-beat plot, and it is offbeat.  Ms Burton is a writer to watch.
B00A6CCF0K|5|I read all of Syephen Kings books. I loved this one!!! Plan on reading it again and again and again!
B00IUBXPEY|4|I was much happier with this film than I was with the first. The film is much darker and the characters are better developed. Well done.
B000001C6M|5|Slayer slays, including this album. Regardless many years since its release it is still kicking butt. Great album.
0736063684|5|I owned the first edition of this book at one time, and I kicked myself for selling it when I finally joined a gym and started working out on a regular basis.  This edition is an indispensable reference for planning your workouts.  It is conveniently divided into seven parts, so it's possible to exercise almost every one of your muscles in a week.  The drawings show you which exercises and angles work which muscles, variations of common lifts, and all muscles in each exercise are individually labeled. <br /> <br />The difference between the first and second editions is noticeable, but the update is not significant enough for me to recommend that owners of the first edition buy this second edition.  The new features include some information on the differences between men's and women's bodies as well as differences among all people.  For example, your friend might be able to lift a weight in a certain way, but the structures of your elbows force you to lift the weight in a modified form.  Along with this acknowledgement of different body types and shapes comes more information on safety with regard to muscle and tendon tears. <br /> <br />If you need help with your weightlifting form, need tips for lifting weights safely, or you are simply interested in how the human body bears weight, this is a great book for you, indeed.
B006LSZECO|4|I liked it very much and would recommend it
B00005K3NR|4|The DVD resolution is good.  It arrive two days earlier, before the promised delivery date.<br />Thanks.
B0060ZJ7BC|5|A good movie to watch when you need a break from life. No chase scenes, vampires, or sex porn; enjoyable
B000AWYOGE|4|I liked it. It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be and the ending was sad (made me cry) but I thought it was VERY GOOD!
B00009NQQO|5|Hands down the best bath toy we've had.  My 4 and 2 1/2 year old girls love playing with these in the tub.  The hoop is fun, but the balls also collect and squirt water - double the fun!  Highly recommend, just don't forget to pull the curtain closed!

B00APKIN1I|5|Everyone in rock music knows the names Dave Grohl and Rupert Neve. Here Mr. Grohl has created an absorbing love letter to one of Rupert's awe-inspiring electronic masterpeices, through which some of the most iconic sounds of rock & roll passed. The Neve console played  a large role in taking these sounds from great to top-shelf. Everyone involved did  a wonderful job on this film. Anyone interested in music production should see this film.
1451695195|5|A most extraordinary book! A book not to be kept gathering dust on the bookshelf, but to passed along to everyone who can appreciate this man's incredible journey. It is hopeful and uplifting. For anyone who even questions the hereafter I suggest you read this book. It's the real thing.
030746363X|5|This book packs a lot of information within it's pages, and if you just have a seat and read it, it can be very overwhelming!<br /><br />I think what a lot of people who've left negative reviews here fail to realize is that Tim DOES give conflicting advice throughout the book because each section of the book is devoted to different goals. If you are working towards fat-loss, you will be doing something different (which some reviewers see as \\"conflicting\\") than if you are working towards muscle building.<br /><br />To have success with the book? Identify one single goal to work towards and apply Tim's program. I've started following his slow-carb diet (& started a forum for folks doing the same to support each other at slowcarbrevolution.com). I'm on week one, I'm really tired of beans, which I don't care for, but I am never hungry and losing weight. So the diet is working for me as Tim describes.<br /><br />When it's time to add muscle or build strength, I'll review those chapters and follow that advice - new goal, new techniques. Simple enough!
B00HJ7IO0A|1|I've read during the last months that this was going to be a genuine classic rock album according to SB but it's not ,even with Duff, John 5 and Steve Stevens as guest musicians. I must say that this album lacks of good melodies, the guitar tone is terrible,  Bach's voice is fine, sometimes annoying, only &#34;Hell Inside My Head&#34; is appealing to me, the rest are forgettable modern rock songs, I gave it a chance to this CD but is not worth it, so I shelved into the &#34;oblivion zone&#34;, anyway is a whole lot better than anything Skid Row has done since Sebastian left.
0345350499|5|Mists  was  one  of  the  best  books  I've  ever  read! I  definitly  recommend  it  to  anyone, whether  or  not  you  even  care  about  Arthurian  legend. This  book  is  inspiring  and  interesting.
B009XIXVU6|4|I enjoyed this book but not as much as The Kite Runner and A thousand Splendid Suns. It was good but not gripping.
0395645662|5|The Giver was an extremely good book.  Lois Lowry has potrayed the struggle in Jonas's life excellently.  At the same time Lowry adds some parts to smile at, so the story will not be a full drama.  Many parts also  are hair raising and suspenseful.  By far, I would say the Lois Lowry has  written this book very well, with a surprise ending and all.  Although, it  is not fully appropriate for children under 8 or 9.  I would recommend it  to those who are above 8 or 9 years old.  It was the best book I've ever  read, and I  plan to read more of her books.  Once again, The Giver was an  excellent book, with an excellent author.
B0006L89N8|5|This is among the best books that I have read on building loving male-female relationships. I gained valuable insights about men and women and this helped me to understand my moods and actions and those of my wife. I could clearly see myself being vividly described by the author. I can plainly make out where I need to change to become an understanding and caring husband without being as I always tended to be \\"Mr Fix-It\\" when my wife talks about problems or issues bothering her.<br /><br />I now appreciate the value of cherishing my wife to motivate her. I no longer get surprised when I hear women expressing their feelings through various superlatives, metaphors and generalizations. I now know that men and women communicate differently; they love, think, feel and perceive things differently as though they are from different planets. The book provides useful and helpful problem solving techniques that have greatly helped me in my relationships with women.<br /><br />I would like to thank John Gray for helping me to learn that my differences with my wife are normal and that the difficulties we have often experienced in our relationships have also been experienced by other couples and that these differences, when understood, help to cement strong and lasting relationships.<br /><br />I, therefore, highly recommend this classic which highlight strategies for reducing tensions in relationships and strengthening love through recognizing differences between men and women.
B0012EM5D8|5|I bought this a couple months ago for my three year old son. He loves it and still watches it now and keeps him entertained. Good purchase.
B00003CXTG|1|Just befor this movie came out I head that some of the real World War 2 vets. were very upset, because the flim makers had to stick a love story in the movie so Pearl Harbor would become the smash hit it did.<br />If you loved the way overrated Titanic then you will love Peal Harbor, but if your looking for an war movie like the awsome Tora! Tora! Tora! then don't wast your mony on this DVD. No wonder the Japs. were mad at this movie.
B000LTAY1U|4|I have had this watch for nearly a year now and have had it in rotation with a few others.  Pros:  -Automatic, no batteries  -It's QUIET especially compared to some Timex watches.  - Great lume, a few minutes under some light will result in hours of illumination. Initially it will be very bright and fade to a soft glow after an hour or so.  - The face is done in a aviator format which makes it very simple and easy to read, especially when teaching a little kid how to read analog.   -Day and date  -Price point is great for an intro level automatic watch.  Cons:  -Water resistance only rated at 30m/100ft great for every day but think twice before wearing it to the beach or with any water sports.  -the crystal is reflective.  -Automatic, the watch will wind down/stop if you don't wear it for a day or two.  -Shake and bake, you cant wind it using the crown.  -There is no power reserve indicator.  Conclusion:  It is a great watch and keeps time well while looking sharp. Most of the cons are things I expect from at a higher price point. I have replaced the stock strap with a nato from Watchband girl. Caution to bigger guys the watch is  on the small side.
B008TRUDAS|5|This book series was amazing. I couldn't put them down. I also read hopeless. Also amazing! Looking forward to what colleen hoover has up her sleeve next!
B0034G4ORM|5|this movie is with out a doubt the greatest war film i had ever seen:). it was intense,action-packed from start to  its epic final. screw the critics this film was what id4 should have been. lead by a great cast, decent amount of drama and honor/ bravery to the end. I give thise a 9 out of 10 stars this movie is kickass  hoo raa:)
B0060AY6FO|1|I've come to expect deep suspense from James; this suspense was shallow but lasted forever. The characters were dreary and the plot tedious. I was thrilled only when characters were killed off.
031620157X|5|I bought this book for my 14 year sister.... She finished it in about a week, and she loved it!!!! If you have a kid that's a dreamer and loves to read, then I would definitely recommend this book.
B00VRYCGLO|5|Love it, so much fun and challenging puzzles
B000URWYTS|3|The story of Frank and his mistress was entertaining but needed some editing. Ifelt at times I was plodding through it and kept hoping the pace would speed up.
B00TEAVEY8|5|Grest game
B00CATSONE|5|I agree with the reviewer who points out that this is not a full biography of Tesla, and I too thought that it would be when I started reading. That did not take away from my enjoyment of the book, though.<br /><br />Nikola Tesla is a fascinating man, and his accomplishements were many (and often misattributed). This book provides an overview of Tesla and what he accomplished, as well as an in-depth analysis of why he didn't accomplish more. It goes one step further, which is to share with the readers just how men of Tesla's greatness can fail to reach their full potential, using him as the case study for this main point.<br /><br />The e-book is well-formatted and easy to read, the material is interesting, and it is short and to the point. It may not tell you the whole story of Tesla, but the story that it does tell sheds a lot of light on his backstory and the outcome of his life. Those striving for greatness can take quite a bit away from the points that are made throughout this book.
B005FIO3PU|1|POS.  LED's were out right out of the box.  Very poor quality.
B00K0OI42W|5|This classic book and its wonderful characters and enduring messages will make you want to read it over and over again.
B00992CF6W|1|Minecraft is a horrible game because little kids should not be exposed to this a vulgar game. Parents if you are reading this do not buy this. It has a lot of sex in it and  is a bad influence for your children
B00IX9UTLU|5|Wow oh Wow.... I did not see that coming at all!  This was a good series.  There were so many things that happened to keep your attention.  Yes there is a love story and when Alayna and Hudson come together they burn it up!  Laurelin Paige did great with this series.  Nothing was &#34;expected&#34; in this book.  I didn't find it predictable like a lot of books can be in this genre, which was a nice refreshing change.
B003G4W49C|1|I read the book and loved it.  The movie was a super let down and should have never been made.
B005N95JA4|5|I purchased this CD for the additional 12 outtakes and was also impressed by the quality of sound of the original CD. A nice trip down the past.
B009UX2YAC|4|I 💓 the game but sometimes it freezes my kindle fire.
B00A7CI82I|4|Really good movie, Jeremy Brenner has a tinge of humor and that's what makes this movie different from the other Bourne movies. I really enjoyed it.
B00KVI76ZS|5|Very inspirational.
1476719071|1|After being beyond baffled at the almost 5 star rating on Amazon as well as goodreads I couldn't stand it anymore and had to write my own review. Most people I'm noticing are commenting on the \\"dangerous\\" subject matter, something I honestly didn't even bat an eye at in comparison to the GOD AWFUL writing. I have read dozens upon dozens of young adult novels, some good, some bad, some that I couldn't get past the first few pages of; this book stands on its own because I somehow couldn't stop reading it despite how awful it was.<br />First and foremost, the writing is beyond words. There is no way, NO way something this awful should have been published. Fifty Shades of Grey comes to mind when I think of similar horrendous writing, but even the editor of those books I doubt would have let writing like this be put onto shelves. The dialogue is horrific, resembling not even a trace of reality or even believability. Her descriptions that commingle with the dialogue equally make no sense as the characters go from yelling to being described as \\"beaming\\" in the same sentence. There is no sense between why one thing happens to the next, the characters have no depth and it's almost impossible to grasp an understanding of who anyone is. There is literally no descriptive language at all alone from the sex scenes and how short and sexy the dresses are that Abby wears in ever other chapter. I've read longer books in a shorter amount of time than this one took me because I had to barrel my way through it. When I finally finished I felt like i had wasted an incredible amount of my time on a  true piece of garbage. This may seem harsh, but I think that it is truly awful that a book so horribly written and thought out could be getting such good reviews. The author in no way deserves so much praise.
B00T40UK20|4|Easy to use, comfortable, good range. Instructions were pretty abbreviated and hard to understand, but the device was easy enough to pretty much figure out myself.
B00A2H9PLG|3|May not watch too many times. Should have spent them money on another movie that I would watch more. Guess I don't like Jamie Fox that much!
0060975768|5|It's hard to describe and comment upon a book which is so emotive to a soldier.  I read this at the beginning of company command, and it gripped me very powerfully to the point of where I've given several copies of it to other leaders who worked for me.  It is especially relevant and poignant for leaders that are down doing &quot;muddy boots&quot; jobs, and is very contemporary in that it chronicles the perilous combat of the first air assault operation.  <br />LTG (ret) Harold Mooreimpresses both in his recollection, his frankness, and his connection with his soldiers.  He remembers everyone's name, their character, what made them tick, and truly painted an exquisite picture of the uniquely bonded community that is formed in a combat arms unit.  He did not shuck the responsibility of telling it like it was when it came to human failure, which is all too often a problem in today's military.  <br />Anyone who is dedicated to being the best they can be (and not the Army of One) will benefit from taking on the experience that is this story.
B0002E5O9G|5|I have seen Les Miserables several times with different performers. This is by far the best performance of all times. At least in my opinion.
B004ZMWUCU|4|This book started off slow, but stick with it, it turned into a delightful story that will make you laugh and cry.  Unfortunately it is partly based on truth.  Luckily, things have changed for the better in Ireland over the last 50 years.  The characters  were so real, I was sorry to get to the end of the book, I wanted to learn more about their lives.
B005ZOBNOI|4|I enjoyed reading 'The Fault in Our Stars'. Though the subject matter is serious, the story reveals thoughts and feelings about having cancer and the loss of friends to various types of cancer from teenager's points of view. It is a stark contrast to the way the adults react to news, good or bad. The main characters are Hazel who is 16 and Augustus (Gus) who is 17. Their bond forms over a book Hazel gives Gus to read.  I purchased this book mainly because I had seen previews for the movie.I usually like to read the book that inspired the movie before deciding whether or not I will see it at the theatre.  I had no idea the book was a book written for young readers(6 th-8 th). if that is the case, I'm appalled at the unnecessary use of curse words throughout the novel. I don't believe it added to the feelings being expressed in the novel and because kids are bombarded with negative influences in almost every video game, movie, television show and just hanging out with friends, it seems that an author writing to that aged audience should have a greater sense of responsibility too the readers. That said, the stark contrast between how the adults and teens handle the deep subject of dying from incurable cancer is fascinating and refreshing.
B00VRYCGLO|1|Not such a great game
B005ZOBNOI|5|Amazing book! A must read! I could read it over and over again!
0765326361|5|One of my favorites.
B006M4F67A|5|This is a great amount of fun to help your mind work.  These are the games that you can play for hours and it causes your mind to float in different levels of concentration.
B00DPH7Q0W|5|excellent
B00HDMMISA|5|Love the way this woman writes. She puts you right into the story. Really liked this book!!
B00C7KXUOE|5|Good actors. Each episode has you guessing. Would love to watch another season. You are always thinking how could the next killer be any worse then the last.
B004DK5CW4|5|I saw this horse run his Triple Crown.  This movie is as wonderful as this horse.  Man O' War was my favorite until Secretariat.  Both of them &#34;Big Red&#34; horses.  The acting is superb.  Get &#34;Life&#34; magazine on Secretariat.  It compliments this movie.  This movie is very good!
B006MOW98E|5|That was great and that's all I have to say  and I'm happy now because this was a really cool book
B003Y5HWMW|1|My wife and I enjoy this kind of story, but we found \\"Game of Thrones\\" to be dull and vulgar.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy Crush Saga is on of the bes games I have ever played in my life! I love competing with my friends for the highest score. The only bad thing is that it is so addicting that I just sit there playing gor hours on end and forhet to eat or do anything important. I am obsessed!
B004SBX112|4|I love all Angry Birds, and I do enjoy Angry Birds Seasons, but I have a Kindle Fire, and when I updated the app to the Holiday 2011 version, I received all the new levels, but the cover of the app is still the the angry bird in the green background with twigs. Not the angry bird in the snow.
B0083Z614S|5|A heart warming and lovely story. What child wouldn't revel in having their own secret area, with additional secrets to go with it?
B004MC8CA2|5|Easy access and navigation. I had used this on. iphone.  Even better here. I highly recommend it to any serious Bible student.
B00QW8TYWO|4|I love this game but it can get boring after a while.
B00005MP58|5|This version of Pride and Prejudice stays true to the book while bringing it to life in an amazing way.  If you are a fan of this era of literature, no other version of this movie will do.  The scenery is amazing, the acting is superb.  At no time did I feel any actor was not holding up his/her part of the movie.  Everything about this movie is a perfect blending and balancing of reality and the fantasy of literature.  And who couldn't stare at Colin Firth through 6 DVDs?!
B008X9Z3UC|5|It's been protecting my Kindle for a year now and it is holding up well.  It's been dropped a few times with no damage.  If you like to use your Kindle Fire with out a cumbersome case, this protects it well when your not using it or traveling.
B004JN1CW4|4|A little disappointing story plot but easy fast read, although I do love the ending [leaving it to your imagination.]
B008469DGY|5|This is the best golf app I've played. I got it free but worth s buck any day. So get it now.
B001UAX56A|5|I truly enjoyed the music. It sounds as fresh and the day she released the album. Glad i was able to locate. Anyone that like her music need to listen then purchase.
B00GFOG88I|1|One of the worst endings ever. It's as if the last 10 pages were deleted really!!!!!! Really a terrible end to what could have been a great read!!!!
B00G2GMRCU|5|Great book!
B00EE3HVMO|5|review for the series as a whole:<br />British TV is good for TV police dramas like Morse and now Broadchurch. In this world of jumpy video cuts, all the camera work is very slow. It takes in everyone's expression and their time to react. I think as a whole the series is deliberately slow to force you to witness the effects it has on everyone as the suspicion and hearsay run rampant in the vacuum until the killer is apprehended.<br /><br />All good detective shows generally have a flawed main character to provide intrigue and backstory. this is no different, David T plays this well. without getting sentimental. The slow camera work works well with the lives of quiet desperation in British suburbia/coastal town. And as the lies, deceits and denials come to the surface. It allows time to take in all aspects of what is going on without giving away who is the murderer.<br /><br />It touches on many sensitive subjects and the town is forever changed for them. Yet hopefully more real for it.<br /><br />If it is remade in America, it would remind me of the Jesse Stone movies a little in general tone.
B00K3Q0XGM|3|What makes good music is love and chemistry.<br /><br />Just for a moment, imagine that Chicago are not a group of in it to win it friends. Rather, Chicago is a scattered group of very talented musicians and song writers that can overdub cool parts.<br /><br />Some parts shine, good horn lines (makes sense using above logic) But you perceive the lack of chemistry.<br /><br />That said, what do you expect, its not 1970 anymore. This is the best album in 30 years.
B00BAXFJ5M|3|Good book
B004QSQML8|5|I JUST LOVE THIS MOVIE,
B00000739S|3|Warning this overpriced import IS released domestically as Lou Reed Extended Versions.  This CD is the second half of the Rock N Roll Animal show but not as compelling.  Just friendly advice from one Lou Reed fan who paid $40.00 for an import when I walked in the next day into a gas station to see Lou Reed - Extended Versions took it home and found out the hard way it is the same exact CD...same master too!!  Buyer Beware hope you find this helpful.
B004U8VX2M|5|The granddaddy of Downton Abbey. Rich in characters and story lines. Steeped in the history of turn of century England and beyond. Beautifully presented. Do yourself a favor and watch it again or for first time.
B00007JMCX|5|A moody and cerebral science fiction tale , that works as original device to explore the most intimate places of the human soul from the allienian point of view.<br /><br />This may be the masterpiece of Nicholas Roeg and one the two most terrific performances given for David Bowie (the other one would be Merry Christmas Mister Lawrence best known as Furyo).<br /><br />Do not miss this one .<br /><br />A timeless cult movie .
B009FZHYKU|5|fast smooth easy to watch.<br />walking dead has caught this nation by surprise. i watch sitting by the edge of my seat weekly. thanks to amazon i don't have to DVR or watch live.. i can watch for my laptop/ cell phone. life goes on.

0439023513|2|The first one was good, the second okay, but the third disappointed me.  I kept putting it down and forcing myself to come back and finish it.  I think it's mainly because the character of Katniss is SO unlikeable.  She is selfish, bratty, and I just want to shake her.  I understand that the author means to convey the traits \\"fierce\\" and \\"independent\\", but she fails to do so as Katniss seems to complain constantly, and be ever-so-ready to betray or hurt someone.   Perhaps the author realized she didn't have to portray Katniss as someone for us to like.  We all love Peeta, and that's what makes us root for Katniss, his survival and well-being depends on her survival.  The end was so depressing.  The whole book was depressing.  ***SPOILERS below, questions I have?    Why was it not elaborated at the trial that Coin had used her as a pawn, and therefore let off for something else, but not because she was \\"insane\\"?  Why was Prim in the Capitol?  I thought she was working in the hospital to care for the injured. How could Gale give up so easily? Not even a visit, nor an explanation to Katniss? (And for us readers?)

B00FLU0AQI|1|I installed this on my phone and tried it out.  The app itself is ok but the first thing I noticed was that it impacted my battery life.<br />I decided to uninstall it but it wont come off my phone.  I am very annoyed.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Does what you want and large buttons to see.
B001DJLCRC|4|I watched the entire first season in one sitting and enjoyed it very much but felt the show could have benefitted from at least one scene illustrating the havoc that crystal meth can create in the lives of many of its abusers and Walter White's reaction to it. I mean, I can't recall any scene where White expresses one shred of regret for what he unleashes upon the world. And I couldn't stop thinking of the countless methamphetamine addicts White would help create after they took thier first hit of his purer-than-pure drug and chased it forever thereafter to thier utter ruin. White seems so decent and morally-driven that I doubt he wouldn't have considered this as well. A great show though overall. Bryan Cranston is a wonderful actor.
B009KS4XRO|5|Easy to use, earn points fast, it's free and I play for hours and hours every night. It's fun to play with others around the world with live chat. You can even exchange things you win, coins, free slots, and symbols you can collect. All around fun time.
B00KK0PICK|5|This woman is just like me even starting at such a young age. I love meeting a kindred spirit and it's encouraging and inspirational because it is hard if you live with people and talk to people that just can't imagine getting rid of stuff especially if they still have room for it. For me, clutter is like the end of a stream where all the leaves and sticks and debris gather and stay because the water can't flow out. I need to take a big stick and push the stuff out so the water will flow but if you don't get rid of it the muck just gathers somewhere else so you really have to let it go. How much clutter is too much is personal, but when it's gone there is such a great emotional and physical freedom. It's like quitting smoking, though, because now you will either have to learn to relax and just enjoy it or you will have to start on those dreams you always wanted to do but didn't have time. It clears up your life that much!
B008Y2FRFO|4|It was fun playing for awhile until you run out of coins and have to wait 24 hours for it to refill back up. I give it 4 stars because it is fun and it is free. Unless like everything else in the World if you want more coins to play you gotta pay. Not paying, period.
B002ZG999U|5|ARRIVED VERY FAST AND IN GOOD CONDITION. CAN'T ASK FOR MORE.  DURING THE XMAS RUSH SOME THINGS GET LOST BUT I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THIS IN MY MAIL BOX.
B00COGXGNQ|4|Even though I haven't read the book I enjoyed the movie... The surprise twist reminded me of the movie The sixth sense... Left me happy to wonder about the character's futures!  Always like stories about people able to find a home!
B00VFTA70I|5|Great movie!
B005ELQVGW|3|I was really disappointed in Bjork's last two albums, Medulla and Volta.  When the early reviews said this hearkened back to the days of Vespertine and Homogenic, I ordered it with no advanced preview.  While I like it better than the latest two albums.......it is still a far cry to me from being as good as Vespertine and Homogenic.  Just my two krona.
B000QCS8TW|5|I am a fan of the TV series and the book is even better.  Well written and so easy to keep the numerous characters straight.  The story is spellbinding.  Could not put the book down.  One the second book now.

B00B4Z5J92|4|The answer -- lots.. I knew of Sound City but not the in depth knowledge imparted in this documentary. Interesting to see how the music scene evolved there. Excellent documentary!
B004X2M9VY|5|DR Who is one of the best science fiction shows of all time in my opinion. There has not been an episode that I have not liked.<br />I cant say anything negative about the doctor. All these shows are awesome !
B00J3AW23G|5|need more of these
1594202249|5|For some reason this book has been on my mind.  I read it several years ago when it first came out, and really liked it.  I have read pretty much all of Pynchon's work, and I want to make clear that I don't disagree with any of the negative reviews here.  But I was watching The Big Lebowski on cable the other day, and it struck me that this is cut from the same confusing, pot-driven, crime based view of California as that movie. The Dude reminded me of the detective here. My guess is that if you don't get The Big Lebowski, then you probably won't get this, either.  So, this is hardly a complete review, just a thought that crossed my mind, since both Inherent Vice and The Big Lebowski really stick with you, in their bizarre, fractured view of life.
630445838X|5|Jumanji is one of my favorite movies of all time!  Definitely one worth buying!  It seems to have the perfect balance between mystery and action and comedy as well with a teeny bit of romance in there too!  I always like watching this movie because it is one where you don't have to worry about awkward scenes and can just sit back and relax and enjoy the show.  It is a true classic!

B0024QEZG8|5|This product appears to be identical to “Edition Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler - The Complete RIAS Recordings,” which Amazon is also selling (currently at a different price).  Here is my review of “Edition Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler - The Complete RIAS Recordings”:<br /><br />There are three reasons why you should purchase this set of 12 CDs of Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, prepared by Audite from the archival tapes of broadcasts by RIAS (Radio in the American Sector of Germany) between 1947 and 1954.  (1) Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler (1886-1954) was one of the greatest conductors of the past 100 years, the era of recorded music – in the opinion of many, the greatest.  “Furtw&auml;ngler possessed the great secret of proportion…He understood how to interpret [the smallest] phrases, themes, sections, movements, and entire symphonies as artistic unities.” [Paul Hindemith]  “It is safe to say that never in his life did Furtw&auml;ngler give a routine performance.” [Harold Schonberg]  (2) Good recorded sound is essential for revealing those details of phrasing and intonation that distinguish a Furtw&auml;ngler performance and leave you saying, “Of course!  Now I finally understand what the composer intended.”  (3) These 12 CDs, thanks to the quality of the original tapes and whatever magic the Audite engineers applied, have the best sound I have ever heard in Furtw&auml;ngler recordings; although they date back to 1947-1954, they are comparable to modern recordings, except for not being stereo.  The 12 CDs concentrate on Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms, plus a glorious Bruckner 8th, plus three living (in 1954) German composers.  The CDs present the actual broadcasts over those 7 years; thus, there are two performances each of Beethoven’s 3rd, 5th, and 6th, Schubert’s 8th, and Brahms’ 3rd symphonies, but none, for example, of Beethoven’s 7th or 9th or Brahms’ 1st or 2nd.  The “EMI Classics References” sets of Furtw&auml;ngler conducting the complete Beethoven and Brahms symphonies will round out your collection and the Music & Arts CD of Furtw&auml;ngler’s 1954 Lucerne performance of Beethoven’s 9th is also a gem.  Finally, three personal reasons why I treasure this set: (1) The Schubert 9th, taking into account the composition itself and this performance, is possibly the most beautiful music I have ever heard – from the hymn-like introduction; to the heartbreak of the 2nd movement (17:04 here yet not a second too long because Furtw&auml;ngler will have you concentrating on every note); to the crisp, volatile scherzo; to the explosive, life-affirming exultation of the finale that will make you swing your arms.  (2) Mendelssohn’s Overture to a Midsummer Night’s Dream is Mendelssohn as you may perhaps have never heard him before: mysterious…creative…daring.  It may also remind you that Furtw&auml;ngler courageously programmed this overture in Berlin in 1934.  (3) A 13th CD is a Q&A session (in German) of Furtw&auml;ngler with music students in Berlin.  He discusses various compositions with them in a down-to-earth way; interesting and useful information.ethoven and Brahms symphonies will round out your collection and the Music & Arts CD of Furtw&auml;ngler’s 1954 Lucerne performance of Beethoven’s 9th is also a gem.

B00E0SX118|5|Great family movie!  Our kids (ages 3 and 6) both love it, as do my husband and I.  There are deeper, more meaningful themes for the older kids and adults, but plenty of simple comedy for younger kids.<br />Every actor who voiced a character was excellent.<br />Definitely recommend!
0805095152|5|Wow!  I've heard most of this before but it was a good refresher.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|Works very well, its smooth its quick its very easy to customize. All around the best mouse I've purchased and it doesn't break the bank.
0385344228|5|I loved this book and could not put it down, ended up reading it in 2 1/2 days.  After finishing, I went back and re-read certain parts again because I didn't want it to end.  I'm glad I did because it helped me to understand the tragic ending and the mystery as to why it ended the way it did.  Would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes murder mysteries and fast reads.  Hope the author's other books are as good.
B0068FZ0GK|3|Movie was in good condition.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Graphics are very nice. Had a cool story line. Tried many similar games and really didn't like any of them. This one was much better: exciting, fun,  and original. The others were boring and consisted of the run of the mill, monotonous search and find.  In contrast, this game had several other objectives. In addition to the search and find, it included puzzles, card games, and more. Also, the ability to move between locations within the game play as the main character (not just clicking on a tile or map area). Will be purchasing the full edition, which I do not normally do. Thanks!
B007C4ZJ0S|4|I had sworn off Steven Soderbergh films after a couple of dreadful \\"Ocean's\\" movies and that paragon of self-indulgence \\"Bubble\\", so it's fortunate that I knew nothing about \\"Haywire\\" before I saw it. Soderbergh conceived the film as a vehicle for mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano, who has an imposing combination of good looks, physicality, and charisma. Soderbergh filmed, directed, and edited the film, but he did not write it. That job went to Lem Dobbs, who gives us a storyline sufficiently convoluted that it gives the audience the impression it is watching a spy thriller. But this is basically a chase film, with a great cast, that showcases Gina Carano's charms and skills in a series of great hand-to-hand combat scenes.<br /><br />Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is on the run in the car of a young man named Scott (Michael Angarano), who happened to be available when she was attacked by ex-colleague Aaron (Channing Tatum). As she drives with injured arm, she tells Scott why and from whom she is running. It began in Barcelona, where Mallory was sent by her employer Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to rescue a dissident journalist who had been kidnapped. All went well; the team split up and headed home. But experiences on her next  job in Dublin led Mallory to believe that she's being set up. Government agent Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas), who contracts with her security firm, seems to know this but is more interested in discovering Kenneth's motives than in helping Mallory.<br /><br />I admire the spareness of this film. \\"Haywire\\" is only 93 minutes long. No CGI. No explosions. Just running, fighting, a car chase, and some tantalizing scenes in which Mallory interacts with fellow contractors. They never trust one another. Female action heroines don't usually make much of an impression. The exceptions are Sigourney Weaver of the \\"Alien\\" franchise and Angelina Jolie, who has had moderate success as an action star. Both of those women are tall, with features striking enough to hold their own onscreen beside men and artillery. Gina Carano goes one better, as she is really a fighter. She does action in real life. I love the visceral quality of \\"Haywire\\"s fights.<br /><br />I especially love Mallory's fight in a cocktail dress. Usually when women get into physical altercations while wearing a skirt in a movie, it's preposterous. But Mallory kicks off her heels, the dress tears at the seam, her pantyhose run, while she beats the stuffing out of someone. It's down and dirty and glamorous too. -Though I was moved to some pity for the men; the actors must have been black and blue from head to toe. There were no stunt doubles. \\"Haywire\\" is an exercise in style. There is not much plot. The device by which Mallory recounts the story to Scott, so that we enter midway in the narrative, is clumsy. But \\"Haywire\\" is seductive and energetic, and that is all one asks of an action flick.<br /><br />The DVD (LionsGate 2012): There are two featurettes. \\"Gina Carano in Training\\" (16 min) interviews Jamie Levine of World Extreme Fighting, Stephen Soderbergh, some of the cast, Special Ops technical advisor Aaron Cohen, fight choreographer J J Perry, and Gina Carano about the conception of the film, preparation, and behind-the-scenes insight into the three main fight scenes. \\"The Men of Haywire\\" (5 min) interviews Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, and Channing Tatum about what attracted them to the project and working/fighting with Carano.

B00000ILDE|5|When Ridley Scott released the monster of \\"Alien\\" back in 1979 a new legend was formed. For 7 years fans wanted to know what happened to Ellen Ripley, and finally, in 1986, the long awaited sequel of \\"Aliens\\" was released. And may I say that it does not disappoint in the slightest! Let me explain dudes...<br /><br />\\"Alien\\" was undoubtedly a Sci-Fi horror as members of the Nostromo were killed off one by one by a hideos black \\"xenomorph.\\" Ellen Ripley is the sole survivor of the incident and escapes by entering an evacuation module and going into hyper-sleep. \\"Aliens\\" picks up over two centuries later when Ripley is awakened after being discovered by another crew and is brought back to Earth. She is soon convinced to join a group of marines in exploring a colony on Aurora-51; a planet that has been besieged by the same monstrous creatures that hunted Ripley. She soon discovers many new things about the creatures and soon finds herself battling survival with the group of marines. A pretty cool storyline I think, and for an action sci-fi it's totally suitable. 9/10 for the storyline.<br /><br />In \\"Alien\\" we believed that these aliens were solitary creatures that hunted and killed in order to survive. \\"Aliens\\" reveals that the aliens are actually creatures that live and co-exist in rather large groups, and that there are various forms of Alien: these range from the common drone, to facehuggers and larvae and a Queen that is the central hub of the hive, much like that of bees. We also learn that the Aliens work to grow and protect the hive and are extremely hostile yet surprisingly intelligent creatures.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is 100% correct, but the concept of the \\"Dropship\\" seems to have been introduced by \\"Aliens.\\" I haven't seen dropships in earlier movies, so this seems to be one of the very innovative and new ideas that \\"Aliens\\" brought to the genre of Sci-Fi. The Marines also have weapons that are more practically orientated and are believably futuristic. Using laser guns would've made this movie lame, and James Cameron has chosen to maintain the gritty and dark atmosphere of \\"Alien\\" through these advanced projectile weapons. The Smartgun makes its first appearance in this film, along with the Pulse Rifle. Smartguns are able to track and \\"lock\\" onto targets and also have advanced target-friend recognition technology. The uniforms of the marines are also very futuristic and also have a practical feel. Aurora-51 is also an extremely dark planet with a naturally hostile atmosphere (Weyland-Yutani developed \\"Atmosphere Processors\\" to convert hazardous gas-chemicals to breathable air  in order for humans to exist on this planet).<br /><br />The Aliens are kept strongly to the original design and the Queen is a very impressive specimen. The Alien Hive seems to almost live and breathe and appear just as slimy and disgusting as the aliens themselves. Cameron shows his genius as a director by keeping action realistic (in most cases) and his creation of mood and atmosphere through landscapes, lighting, characters, weapons and storyline. You really have to see \\"Aliens\\" to truly understand how truly revolutionary and incredible it is.<br /><br />The movie is a refreshing Sci-Fi Action that is extremely innovative, dark and creative. Cameron has successfully expanded on the \\"Alien\\" franchise and has made a truly interesting and exciting movie. The conflict between Ripley and The Queen near the end is certainly a highlight. Nice to see to overzealous females trying to kick the crap out of each other. What kind of action is better, honestly? And to the guy who found this boring - either you get high on some s*** very often or you are far from a Sci-Fi fan. \\"Aliens\\" is a classic that joins the ranks of \\"Alien\\" as a classic Sci-Fi movie. And anybody who wants to dispute that may want to watch out for fans - we're everywhere, and you never know when we may latch onto your face and plant eggs in your body...<br /><br />\\"Aliens\\" gets a full 100% in my book. Today the storyline may not be highly original, but the creation of atmospheres, action, good acting, tension and creativity makes \\"Aliens\\" a true Sci-Fi Giant. So rent it or buy it, but it's essential watching for any good \\"Alien\\" fan and Sci-Fi fans alike. Now stop reading and go watch! BUY NOW! REGRET NEVER!>\\"Aliens\\" gets a full 100% in my book.

B000002BMV|4|In the office I worked in back in 1982, I was the only black girl, and I worked with three other white girls who LOVED Journey.  I remember when they came to Cleveland, there was nothing that was going to keep them from going to the concert to see them.  I had never heard of Journey - wasn't into them.  One night, I was at home and turned on MTV, and there was the video playing on this band that the \\"girls\\" in my office was so gaga over.  That was the night I feel in love with Journey.  Oh, how I loved the sincerety of Steve Perry's voice - as well as the musicianship of the band as a whole.  Who's crying now!  I turn that song up loud every time I hear it - an era of bands that's long gone goodbye.....

B000G759LW|4|Save for the spectacular 'I got Trouble' in which Christina channels Bessie Smith, this album is not dressed much in 20'-40's musical arrangements...However, this is one fantastic album overall and a major accomplishment for Ms. Aguilera coming from the land of over-produced, teeny-boppers...But we all knew she could sing and if any one was going to make it out alive, it was going to be her.  <br />Back to Basics has a few duds in my personal opinion, but out of 22 songs, said 'duds' are very few and far between.  <br />I especially like 'Save Me From Myself' as it is a welcomed departure from Christina's big showy vocals and she delivers with such restraint and control to this acoustic masterpiece, that I can only hope she goes in that direction for her next project; that or the direction in which 'Mercy on Me'  points towards... Imagine Christina putting out an album like Betty lavette's latest blues/rock masterpiece! <br />Anyhow, if you love her or you don't, she can sing and she desrves credit for living it up - her way and on her terms. <br />Congrats!
B000B5XOY8|4|The 1989 Batman film is probably the best we'll ever see of The Dark Knight in a major motion picture. At the time of this writing there has been two Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan, I won't waste time comparing Burton to Nolan but I will certain defend this first outing with Michael Keaton wearing the cape and cowl.<br /><br />There has been a common complaint that Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier aka \\" The Joker\\" takes over the picture. I believe it's safe to say that Nicholson indeed has more screentime than Keaton however that was the proper direction to take. The Joker is suppose to be the one in the limelight to soak up the attention because he because he sees himself as a great artist and entertainter and remaining Anonymous would be the last thing on mind. In the old comics, he would announce his murders on radio or television. They pay homage of sorts to these declarations in this film. But how would I rate Nicholson's preformance ? Though Jack understood Joker as a loose cannon, I don't think came off as threatening as he should have been. Nicholson was often left to flail on camera and that destroyed some credibility of the character. Despite some of the camp though, Joker did indeed seem dangerous at some points when he poisoned Gotham's personal hygiene products and at one point killing his most trusted henchman for no reason; I would like to have more of those scenes in the film.<br /><br />Another common complaint is the lack Batman's character development but it's quite the contrary, The very first crime you see committed in the film reflects that tragic night when Wayne's parents were murdered and that is just one of the great scenes that shows Batman's/Wayne's personality and motivations. Take for example Bruce's charity party to raise funds to save the festival commemorating the 200th anniversary of Gotham City. Bruce Wayne is once again saving Gotham but without his cape or cowl. Secound, notice the way Bruce acts when he socializes with Vicki Vale and others. Bruce seems to be keeping himself at arms length among his festivities by keeping to himself and lies to Vicky Vale about who is. His behavior also dosen't relfect someone who would be a famous \\"playboy\\" bachelor, you see him talking to only Vale and her collague surrounded by un-usual ar in a private room. When Bruce is confronted with a minor problem such as determining how many champagne bottles he needs to open, he seems to be a little lost and still remains so even when Alfred reports news that would obviously be important to Batman; The circumstances of simple social behavior seems to trouble him. Really, how can anyone say all this isn't character development ? We already knew from the hold up earlier to Bruce Wayne at the party that Batman is Wayne's solace and not just a mission or goal, everything else is inconsequential. This is a light hearted illustration of Bruce's loneliness. The real tragic part occurs when Bruce lies to Vicki after sleeping with her, he said he has been called out of town. What does he end up doing ? He places two roses in a dirty alley and quite obviously, it's the place where Bruce's parents were murdered. This is a sad revelation, he falls into the arms of a woman, possibly having done this more than once, but pathetically retreats into the shadows. He remains that child that lost his parents and can't find comfort.<br /><br />Now as to how Batman is presented. Again Burton has understood what the character of Batman is, a myth. As long as he remains as such, he already has the advantage of his foes and fear is merely the unknown. Once again returning to the first hold-up committed in the film, Batman lowers himself down and surprises the criminals with his cape as simulated wings. Like an animal he asserts himself as appearing bigger and more dangerous and even after he is shot down, he rises up once again with his pseudo-wings in hand to further drive the myth of being a creature and not a man; Someone who is invunerable and can not be killed. He threatens one of the thugs by dangling over the edge of building and declares himself as Batman. Really it's the perfect introduction to a theatrical character. The suit itself also combines Hollywood flash, that classic yellow symbol Batman insignia, but the rest is the vein of a classic horror figure in the vein of Bela Lugosi's Dracula or Max Schreck's Nosferatu. This is the perfect Batman for film, pure imagination from a thoughtful director.<br /><br />Now of course there comes the question of how it all puts together. This film has a great many centerpieces. Batman's introduction, The Joker's \\"birth\\", some of Joker's victims, Bruce recalling his parent's death, and of course the action sequences. Some of it has suffered because of times. Generally, the action is convential and well done but not the most memorable parts of the films. The late Derrick Meddings of James Bond fame worked on the minatures and they still do hold up today but it's pretty damn obvious those are toy cars you see when the Bat-Wing crashes. I think the only genuinely awful part of the film is the finale. After Batman and Joker, with Vicky Vale hostage, climbs to the top of a gigantic cathedral some more fights take place and Batman and Joker have a rather silly final confrontation exchanging one-liners and Joker pulling out a sight-gag. It ends with Batman and Vicki Vale dangling at the edge of cathedral with Joker flailing around like a moron and he pretty much kills himself in a rather clumsy and stupid way. A really mediocre ending to what was fine film before.<br /><br />Overall, for the many reasons stated, I think this the best live-action Batman film to date. It's flawed yes because Nicholson could have used more direction and a bit more creavity with the action but I'd say this is the Bat film that others should look up to in the future and beyound.d can not be killed. He threatens one of the thugs by dangling over the edge of building and declares himself as Batman. Really it's the perfect introduction to a theatrical character. The suit itself also combines Hollywood flash, that classic yellow symbol Batman insignia, but the rest is the vein of a classic horror figure in the vein of Bela Lugosi's Dracula or Max Schreck's Nosferatu. This is the perfect Batman for film, pure imagination from a thoughtful director.    Now of course there comes the question of how it all puts together. This film has a great many centerpieces. Batman's introduction, The Joker's \\"birth\\", some of Joker's victims, Bruce recalling his parent's death, and of course the action sequences. Some of it has suffered because of times. Generally, the action is convential and well done but not the most memorable parts of the films. The late Derrick Meddings of James Bond fame worked on the minatures and they still do hold up today but it's pretty damn obvious those are toy cars you see when the Bat-Wing crashes. I think the only genuinely awful part of the film is the finale. After Batman and Joker, with Vicky Vale hostage, climbs to the top of a gigantic cathedral some more fights take place and Batman and Joker have a rather silly final confrontation exchanging one-liners and Joker pulling out a sight-gag. It ends with Batman and Vicki Vale dangling at the edge of cathedral with Joker flailing around like a moron and he pretty much kills himself in a rather clumsy and stupid way. A really mediocre ending to what was fine film before.    Overall, for the many reasons stated, I think this the best live-action Batman film to date. It's flawed yes because Nicholson could have used more direction and a bit more creavity with the action but I'd say this is the Bat film that others should look up to in the future and beyound.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Basic solitary at its finest! The ads can get annoying but I didn't pay a penny for this app so I won't make a big fuss about it. The only thing I would change is the auto win button that pops up when it's obvious your about to win. I want to click until the very last card is placed where it needs to go!!
B00BB8SKPW|3|It was ok, nothing really spectacular about it. Interesting premise. Denzel fans would probably enjoy it more than I did.
B00006NSZ5|5|This disc is awesome! Em's 3 new songs are, in my opinion, the best on the disc. The songs I'm referring to are \\"Lose Yourself,\\" (of course) \\"8 Mile,\\" and \\"Rabbit Run.\\" I never really used to like Eminem, but then, I bought \\"The Eminem Show,\\" and I was instantly hooked! He doesn't b-s the world into thinking that superstardom is the greatest thing, but is honest about his own life, and he just throws reality into every listener's face. I respect him for that. Anyways, \\"Lose Yourself\\" is a perfect theme for the movie, which I CANNOT wait to see. I'm looking forward to seeing how his performance lives up to its hype. Hats off to you, Em! Got another hit with this one! For those of you who don't have it, go out and get it! If you're a fan or you just like Eminem, you won't be disappointed!
B00P9TTSK0|4|great game, very interactive, but costly with add-ons.
0385351399|4|I liked this book for it's somewhat honest portrayal of too much technology is a bad thing. Sadly, I'm afraid some readers will buy into the same ideas that the main character does. Mostly, it left me feeling 'icky' because the characters are all so detestable, but I think maybe that was the point.
B001BZF9UY|5|I love this movie score.  I've been listening to it every day on my commute to and from work for a couple weeks now.  Each track is different enough to not get old, yet still retains a common theme.  You can hear in the composition and orchestration exactly what character was on screen at the time.  I don't typically buy a whole movie soundtrack album since most of the time there are only one or two great tracks....this one is fantastic all the way through.  Well done gentlemen, well done.
B00003CXXJ|5|&quot;Shrek&quot; is a groundbreaking animated film released in 2001.  It became the first film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film.  This film is terrific for all ages to watch.  It features the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Oscar nominee John Lithgow (&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;), and others.  It explores a journey of three outcasts (an orge, a talking donkey, and a princess with a secret) to attempt to rescue villagers from being forced out of their homes.  The villagers have a twist.  All of them come from famous fairy tales, including the seven dwarves, Pinnocio, Cinderella, and many others.  The quest becomes more than just mission.  The three characters find their true selves and reveal secrets that change their lives forever.  The action sequences contain the entertainment to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.  Some action scenes have a little humor, namely tributing to &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  Every scene throughout the film has its own different theme that keeps audiences entertained, including comedy, action, and romance.  As with the plot, the actors offer their own sense of theme that adds to the thrills.  The wide range of personalities keep audiences interested.  &quot;Shrek&quot; is great film sure to please audiences everywhere.  Fans should also watch &quot;Shrek 2&quot; as the two combined make a great viewing experience.
B0015DRPJU|4|Best of the series so far. Kept you captivated enough to not want to put it down. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B004GJDQT8|5|Very prompt and curtious about replacing a broken item.
B0054JZC6E|3|this game is okay. there are a lot of different games so you are bound to find at least one that you like. my six year old son loves it.
0385738773|3|I really enjoyed reading the first two, and read the Death Cure in a day.  Yes, it's hard to put down.  BUT, there is one tragedy after another.  It gets really ridiculous after awhile.  They overcome one major catastrophe and then find themselves fighting Cranks/zombies, bombs, toxic chemicals, you name it, they overcome it.  I was very disappointed that Thomas' memories were not restored.  It kept building up to that, and then didn't happen.  Felt a little manipulated there.  I thought the ending was tied up nicely though.  It's actually what I hoped would happen when I was reading the 2nd book.  I wish there was a little more time spent on the ending and a little less on all the fighting.  This is probably the most violent of all three books.  I only started reading these b/c my 12 year old loves them and talked me into it.  The Maze Runner  i think is the strongest and the best written of the three.
B000FC13Y0|5|I adore this book. Magic, adventure, love, what else is needed? everything was perfect. Neil Gaiman is always a good read.
B009AP2G26|2|The first three seasons of Glee were highly entertaining and contained some valuable social commentary. Season 4 so far has devolved into a minor soap opera. Missed the mark, overstayed the welcome
0374374562|5|ADORABLE!  I follow Humans of New York on Instagram, so I am familiar with the author.  I love this book - it is a must-have for all children!  I love that it has photos of kids from all walks of life.  I bought it as a gift for a 4-year-old, but was really tempted to keep it for myself (I didn't).  Love it.
B00BSBR9N6|5|Great story, well written. Kept me up all night.
B004CFAWK2|5|I am not a fan of &#34;down-home, folksy&#34; writing, but for some strange reason, I just love the writings of Fannie Flagg. She is an extremely talented writer who can make you laugh out loud and cry on the same page. Her characters are well-developed with amazing insight into life. I had seen this movie years ago but after I had read some other books by Ms. Flagg, I came across this one and was not disappointed.
B00HDMMISA|5|I found it to be the best novel that I've read in a very long time.  I could not put it down.
B00L9B7IKE|3|boring at times , more a book for my wife
B00CO5AQ12|5|I think the grandkids will have lots of fun with this the older one babysits a lot and will be able to enjoy it with the young one's she sits for. Even adults were having fun with it.
B00003CXAQ|3|Fun movie for the not so serious... But the movie is teaching a lot of Asian Indians a new (non-existant) version of their own history. Feels like an India from another planet. Chilled monkey brains and live snakes!  Where  did they get that piece of history from?
B00QL0ST1K|5|Lucas Dale
B007IXWL2C|5|it is a great love story, I have all the books and they are great if you can see the love story in it
B00B8R1NP0|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this extremely well-written and bone chilling detective novel. Thiede doesn't waste your time with a lot of fowl language or poor sentence structure as many new authors tend to. He gets right down to telling the story in all its horrific detail with proper grammar, punctuation, and very few typos. The violence is graphic but not lewd, and there are several victims to sympathize with. If you like Dirty Harry, you will enjoy Time Killer.
B0060Q962Q|5|A blast from the past. Love that it was the free app of the day!! Aside from swearing at the computer player for making me feel stupid....beware....lol.....the computer is quite a player.....haha......But that's what makes it so addictive as you are compelled to kick the computer player's ass!!...haha ...it's a fun great game!!!!
B00SCEET1M|5|My grandkids loved this sweet movie.
B0050DIWFC|5|Lost sleep over this book. Would not stop until I was done. Realistic. Any parent can relate. It absorbs you.
B003JTHXOK|5|I love to read, but I have trouble with books keeping my attention. If that is you, you must read!
B0091REZMW|3|A little small on kindle screen, but u can increase the screen some. Only played few hours so far, but enjoy for the most part. Good thing it's free.
B009C7ZQM4|2|This is the second time in a week this app freeze my unit right at the restart. The program was very good but until I have to reset to factory setting I feel the pain of doing all the reinstall, add media back. i used to love it but now...leave it for a while.
B005LAIHZE|5|This movie was bad @$$ a very different lincoln . It was action packed , bloody , any way the movie is a really good way to lose yourself for a little while and enjoy watching the vampires get handed their @$$<$ handed to them .I hope this helps,enjoy the movie !!!
B000000OTU|5|BIG ONES is Aerosmith`s ultimate collection of songs. Their best songs is all here, including &quot;Cryin`, Angel, Livin` on the Edge, What it takes, Amazing,  Blind Man, Janie`s got a gun...I could list them all..This is probably the one and only cd I can listen to over and over again, because it`s like built up of supreme songs, which is great alone, but is even more great on a record together. And there is no doubt that Aerosmith masters the elements of Rock, Boogie and Real Power Ballads. I`ve just ordered the new Ltd. Edition(2cd) of BIG ONES, and I can`t wait to hear the new stuff. Aerosmith Rocks, and Rocks even bigger with this ultimate Collection!
B00BVYNSLC|4|definitely worth watching !! It has a unique perspective to the scientific idea of cloning people..and its consequences to the ones cloned
B000FVQLQQ|5|great movie, a must see.  well written, great actors, makes you stop and think, had to by it to add to my collection
B005LAIIKI|5|Tarantino does it again. This is an awesome movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Tarantino, modern westerns, and heroic tales. My only cautions are that the movie is long, and the violence is of an exaggerated type. Think Kill Bill, but with guns and explosions.
B00992CF6W|5|the game is really cool and is the only thing I play any more but I can't figure out how to get Multics player thou.
B003Y3ZTGA|2|She's trying to copy all other bouncy gimmicky bubble gum stuff that just sounds the same.  You can't tell one song or singer from the next.  She should take a sleeping pill, grow up and get mellow.  She might have a semi-decent singing voice if she sang a ballad, bot not sure.
B00AHSIQWE|4|The Dark Knight Rises was dark, both literally and figuratively.  Many times the lighting was so poor it was difficult to see what was going on. It was a good story. Our family members are not a huge Bat Man followers, so that might help you gauge.  We liked it, didn't love it.
B0050DIWFC|4|Page turner, exciting, an ending you can't imagine.
0671646788|5|This book was recommended to me by a colleague of mine and this book really opens up the way you think. My views on life has changed after this book and I recommend it to you!
B00JB3O6H0|5|Great deliver with excellent writing.
B000031EGV|5|Loved it, will it bring him back, if we play it again
B00000163G|5|2Pac is by far my favorite rap artist, he has a great voice,beats,and themes. This album was one of his best and the first double disc in rap. I belive that 2pac is still alive and will come back one day. 2PAC 4 LIFE
B00GEEB730|5|I loved this book!
B0000683DH|5|The Wrath of khan is definetly one of the best Star Trek movies to date.  Bringing back Khan and adding several different movie themes was a great idea.  The space battle at the end is marvalous not a Star Wars knock off of any kind.  The story and action all together make this a great Star Trek movie.
B004JN1D2I|4|I got this because of the tv show.  I first heard about this book a long time ago and wish I would have read it first.  The writing is very well done.  One thing I really like is that every &#34;chapter&#34; is from a new view point.  You don't read 5 chapters from the same character in a row.  It will go back in forth between characters each chapter.  The only thing I don't like about this &#34;bundle&#34; is that all four books are combined into one book.  So on my tablet it says I'm 6% done that is 6% done of all four books, not 6% done of book one.  I would have liked if this was four separate books but its not that big of a deal.
B000002H33|5|Okay...call it a mid-age crisis, if you will. Whatever. I wear a suit now, am married, have a kid....but used to rock out to Master, Ride the Lightning, Kill Em All and Justice back when I was in high school in the 80's. I thought I \\"Out-grew\\" Metallica...I realized you don't outgrow good music. I recently bought Some Kind of Monster DVD and it re-kindled a serious love for hard-rock music and the band that I realized you never really \\"out-grow\\", especially when it comes to an album like Master and a band like Metallica. It is truly a classic Metal masterpiece, and Metallica are truly musicians. Even if you are not a true Metal fan (like my wife) you have to appreciate the musical talents of the band (which she now does). The Black album is... the Black Album. 'Nuff said. Take a step back 5 years from the Black Album, open your mind, listen to Master and see that it is even a better???? album than the Black Album. I dare you to find any modern hard rock bands that aren't influenced by Metallica and Master of Puppets (My favorite Met album, although I like all of them) and now my \\"I only like \\"Enter Sandman\\" wife\\" is a Met fan....
B00005RDRO|4|Murder mystery fans will love this laugh fest with some truly great actors.
B00HV8T1WC|1|Boring!
B00783NWB6|5|I have both of these movies in it's 2D format. I love them both; especially the 'Underworld' series. Awakening is probably the best of the series..and 3D makes it all that more appealing. This is a 'must buy' if you like the 'Underworld' series
B00BWBHIUG|5|I love this village type game you learn about different sea creatures, plants, and how ecosystems work. The music and beautiful landscapes are relaxing.
B00IVFC6QC|5|So cute, my daughters love it!
B009JZSC9S|5|Addicted. Waiting for season 5 to be released. In fact I gotta go see my dealers about getting hooked up. The Kings. Lol
0545615402|4|This was purchased as a gift and the recipient was very pleased it.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Excellent
B000VR824S|5|My hubby so much enjoyed this Christmas Gift.. thank you ever so much for your speedy service and quality product
B00IDI7WP2|4|Loved it
B00NQ3M39E|5|Weezer is back to form and sounding great.  I've seen many reviews saying this album is up there with Pinkerton and Blue, and those reviews are right!  This is a fantastic album.  Highly recommended.
B0038P59A0|1|Reading other reviews gave me the impression this would be a worthy investment, but I was totally surprised by the stumbling stupidity of the plot.  The acting was fine, but the storyline and dialogue was worthless!
B00947N6D8|5|The kids will sit and watch this movie over and over.  The Santa Claus character is very entertaining for adults also, &#34;Shoo with your pointy heads.&#34;  The kids laugh and laugh. (me too.)
B009MJU9R4|3|I should have read the size description. It less then 2 inches, but very cute.
B00AWTTUHI|1|Watchmen type rehash with reagan replacing nixon, batman has a little girl as robin instead of the rent boy he had in the past.  Still good anmation great vocie acting and good stroyline beside the fact that joker is evil just because he gay?
0399159347|5|Loved it.Had quite a twist at the end
B00D3PYQT0|5|This was for my wife who was intrigued by snippets of season 4.  Wife and daughter both hooked and watched almost all of it in about a week.
B000FC2L1E|5|Great series, keeps you invested in the characters!
B00012FXB8|5|Poorly received upon release, and long despised for the deaths of beloved characters, Alien 3 was plagued by script troubles, personnel changes, and time constraints due to excessive meddling by Fox.      Into this mess stepped David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en), in his directorial debut on a feature film.  Harassed and bullied to no end by studio execs, Fincher ended up walking off after the end of principal photography and what was released in theaters was a butchered remnant of a brilliant film.  The release of the Alien Quadrilogy returns to the Alien fan an Assembly Cut (Fincher was still too bitter to work on a Director's Cut) of what was close to Fincher's original vision of the film.      Definitely skip straight to the Assembly Cut.  It will be well worth your time.  Whereas Cameron's Special Edition of Aliens ends up overlong and many additions unneeded or damaging to the pacing (I can hear the cries of \\"Blasphemy!\\" now), the thirty three minute increase in length is a profound improvement to Alien 3; almost a whole new movie.  This is what a \\"special edition\\" of a movie should be.  Characters are fleshed out, confusing parts of the plot explained as important scenes are restored or extended, and Fincher's directorial genius better felt.    A powerful story of redemption and sacrifice, Alien 3 is filled with all of the compelling imagery of Fincher's later work.  Alien 3, aside from the creature special effects, stands as the most darkly beautiful of the Alien films, and the most visually breathtaking.  Here, finally, the true strength of Sigourney Weaver's acting prowess can be felt in a story with real meat.  The depth of the character Ripley can be more fully appreciated, and her final scene now carries the meaning it was intended to have; a true choice between sacrifice and tainted salvation.  Elliott Goldenthal's score remains phenomenal.  What we are given in the Assembly Cut is a third sequel that easily stands as an equal to the first two films, ifnot as the best picture in the series and what should have been a most fitting end to a trilogy.      If you've not seen this movie in a long time, do yourself a favor and pick up this DVD, or the Quadrilogy boxed set (though nobody will fault you if you skip on Resurrection).  It will certainly change your entire perspective on the film, and perhaps the entire series.
0765348780|5|I actually didnt start this series for a long time as some reviews said it was such a hard read.its nonsense Im nearly at the end and thankfully ive a long way to go in the series to quench my thirst for some amazing characters. world building hands down its great.honestly sometimes peoples or places names has you a bit confused but thanks  to a name index at the start of the book you quickly realise whos who.im hooked so will you.enjoy
B00HGJ18C2|1|terrible, don't waste your time!
B00B7NPRY8|4|Such an amazing mind!
B007MB5OCE|5|I did enjoy reading this book. The main character is fantastic and his friends are hilarious. The whole story was captivating and I liked how the author connected different times, places and people to design the story. I laughed a lot, and I was kind of sad when I finished the book (Allan is one of a kind!)
B00HZX0IM0|5|This is a cracking album, I think. It's good, solid British R&B (in the old sense) with two geniuses of the genre on fine form. Seeing The Who at Charlton in 1974 and Dr Feelgood (twice) at close range in the Cambridge Corn Exchange around the same time remain among the great musical experiences of my life even 40 years on, and while Wilko, Daltrey and I are all old gits now, it's good to see that at least two out of the three of us have still got the old magic.<br /><br />There is a mix of old Dr Feelgood songs, Wilko's own stuff and one Dylan cover in Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window. I think it's a joy from start to finish. They open with Going Back Home which Daltrey delivers (brilliantly) with a Brilleaux-esque growl way down in his throat (Wilko bends a string and that's all she wrote, of course) but it's recognisably his own take on it. Later in a fantastic Keep It Out Of Sight he really goes for the full Daltrey singing an octave above Brilleaux and, as Pete Townshend once memorably said of Love Reign O'er Me, Roger gives it his b*ll*cks. It's just great stuff all the way through.<br /><br />Wilko is...well, Wilko. Brilliant, distinctive and perhaps slightly more solid and less bonkers than of old, he chops and hits that great beat like a teenager and in my mind he's still staring like a madman and moving around the stage as though he's on casters. Just perfect. The two of them and a very, very good band produce something really good here. Anyone with any interest in this type of music will love this and fans certainly won't be disappointed. This may well be Wilko's swan song and the decision to close the album with All Through The City is inspired.<br /><br />If this is Wilko's last album it is one he can be proud of. Thanks for this, and for everything, Wilko. Go well.
B0054JZC6E|4|easy way to burn some time and have some fun.  depends on your device, how well you can do in the games
B00DPM7TIG|4|Loved the book. In a book club--can't wait for the discussion. I'm glad they took the characters further than just the situation they were in.
0060899190|5|This book was well-packaged and in excellent condition..  I would gladly order from here again.  Some of the secrets make you want to laugh and some make you want to cry, but it is great.
B00BD99JMW|5|Life is not about happy endings, it's about the journey and how you decide to live with the choices that are made by you and by those you love and care for.
0762449896|5|It's a great replica of the Enterprise. It's fantastic. I love it!<br />It's not big, but it's not small.  It's perfect
B007J4T2G8|2|This was really over the top for a book. So cliche ! Some moments were kinda cute with Christian... But just ugh it's just too much. And the erotic  scenes? Embarrassing. I wasted my money on this.
B00003CXSP|1|I am ashamed to have seen such an antipathy of a motion picture. Was this film directed by Ridley Scott even with a try to produce? Aversion! Hannibal Lector (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is hiding in a reclusive location. Sweden? Italy? Don't know. I could care less. The movie moves at an excruciating slow pace and Clarice (played by Julianne Moore this time) seems stiff and moves around like cadaver). Ultra ennui! She has searched for Dr. Lector for many years and she should've has closed the case after \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", a good movie. This movie is truly sickening with its amount of gruesomeness even Jason Voorhees would find lewd! The deformed man that wanted to get revenge on Dr. Lector was just extra malady! By the way, I don't want to get near a pig pen ever! After watching this freak show, I lost my appetite for the rest of the day and ended up not eating for a month. If this is your kind of playground, then by all means dig in! Distasteful, no yummy!
6304795254|1|...as my first review, mysteriously, never appeared in the roster. Onward: Michael Douglas = worse actor than a trained monkey; hearing Sean Penn say &quot;touche&quot; is plain torture; how Fincher went from this atrocity to  Fight Club, the best movie of 1999, is an enigma better left unexplored. On  the whole, a film so flat as to be two-dimensional; it has no redeeming  features, I assure you.
B003JTHESA|5|I have been a fan of this band since the mid-1980s. Today, I listen to a wide range of prog rock and prog metal. I always regarded Seventh Son as Maiden's best outing. But this album has kept locking me in since it was released in 2010. It's impossible to grow tired of it. It is incredibly complex and progressive. I now consider it Maiden's magnum opus, the finest work of one of the world's greatest rock bands.<br /><br />The two standout tracks are Isle of Avalon and Starblind and, in my view, these are the two very best songs Maiden has recorded. The Man Who Would Be King and When the Wild Wind Blows are also excellent. Mother of Mercy and Coming Home are also right up there in the Maiden pantheon.<br /><br />10/10
B00JA9JE0Y|5|Laughter until I cried. Bought another copy of this book for my sister. She loved it too!
098555780X|5|This book has some really interesting patterns and great instructions! I bought about 4 books, and this one has proved to be the best one, I think.
B0000931OG|5|There's something I don't quite understand about this album. Until May of this year, Blur was one of the most respected bands  among indie music fans. This album came out, everyone praised it, and then a couple of weeks later it was forgotten about. I'm not sure why any band would actually lose recognition after releasing their defining statement. <br />To be fair, Blur isn't just any band. Along with Radiohead, they are one of the few groups I know that refuses to make the same album twice. Everything they release is brilliant but different enough to draw in new fans and drive away long-timers. <br />I started liking Blur after 13, (even though I bought \\"Blur\\" based on Song 2.) Even having bought the enitre bands catalogue ,including side projects, I still never saw an album this diverse and brilliant coming. The album leads off with its best song in which Damon proclaims \\"I aint got nothing to be scared of\\" I cannot think of another band that it is more true for. Damon has attempted just about everything there is and has always come out on top so what does he have to be scared of?
B007ZGO7EM|5|This is perfect for simple, everyday tasks. Delivers what it promised, no more, no less. Very pleased to have gotten this.
B008Y5NGG8|5|Great film, wonderful story, beautifully shot.  I enjoyed the way her artwork was encorporated into the narrative scenes and transitions.  Salma Hayek is a vibrant actress, and her supporting cast was outstanding as well.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B008MG1E4A|5|Could not put it down. If only the avg American really understood the sacrifices of these men and others like them. We forever owe them our gratitude.
B0008JIJ2E|5|&#34;Daniel Sun, Wax On, Wax Off&#34;--I don't think any fan of this awesome movie including me of course will ever forget that halarious but beautiful and timeless line of Mr. Miyagi!!!!!&#34; While I was watching Daniel do the wax on, wax off thing I was doing it too and (LMAO) IT WAS SO FUN and it's great exercise!!!!!!!!!! :) I love love this movie. It's halarious but at the same time infinitely beautiful and halarious. I love Mr. Miyagi--he's such a halarious Japanese man!!! Oh I LMAO to Kingdom Come to when Daniel asked him &#34;Hey Mr. Miyagi, what kind of belt do you have??&#34; Then Mr. Miyagi halariously replies &#34;Brown canvas belt from JCPenney--$3.95.&#34; :) I love the birthday party Mr. Miyagi threw for Daniel. It's so funny and beautiful.So cute--&#34;Happy Birthday Daniel Sun&#34;!!!!!!!!!  I love Daniel and Allie together- they are so beautiful together. Sorry, but I hated the sequels and the fact that they broke up---No not in my book they didn't because the first or Original Karate Kid is the one and only REAL and TRUE Karate Kid for me. Oh, don't even ask me about the remake and modern one with Jaden Smith because it's HORRRIBLE!!!!!! IT AIN'T GOT NOTHIN; ON THE ORIGINAL AS WELL!!!!!!!! In my book, Daniel and Allie married after they finished college and that the end!!!!!
B00HDMMISA|5|I read this book really quickly, it kept me entertained the whole time. Great character development, the author can make you feel like you're in the story. Highly recommend.
B000FCKC4C|5|This book is a must read for anyone who wants to realize their dreams that forgot. Don't sleep on this book.
B00H83EUL2|1|I am confused at how this movie even got a great picture nom.  The best part of the movie was the end.
B003O86FMW|4|I read this book during a family trip. I downloaded the ebook into my iPhone and even with the unbelievably small screen I could not put it down and finished the book in no time
B00AIUUXHC|5|This is a very great game upgrading shark after shark, but I recently saw my brother get a new update for the game on his iPad with the giant crab in the crab lair but I didn't get the update for my KindlefireHD so I think FGOL should update the Kindlefire version of the game.
0385504225|2|The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because it is a page-turner at times and I learned some interesting things about Washington, D.C. Most of the time, though, the events in the book seem implausible and then it ends with a lecture. I really hate that.
B003Y5H5AG|1|when i got movie in the mail, it was broken
B009T8XBBO|5|This is a test against the timer game and I am not normally a person that enjoys that, but this one has captured my attention for sure. Fantastic game, doesn't freeze and it is quite a challenge the further you go. I would definitely recommend this game!
B004AKCME8|3|We purchased this movie when we had never seen it before. We have, however, read almost all of the books. While the movie is ok, and the children seemed to enjoy it, I found that it was a little lacking. That doesn't mean it was a bad movie, and I do not regret purchasing it. I will watch it with my children again, however it is definitely a 5 dollar movie.
B00574P9EQ|5|Cute story
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This is awesome
B00AJLHUA8|5|Sinister is my favorite horror movies of all time, and I love this movie, I saw it when it first came out, and I thought it was astounding! AWESOME!!!
068987474X|2|bla bla bla. This stuff was so obvious! I mean, if he doesn't call you back then he's not into you. Do you really need a book to tell you that?? Phleease.
B00DR0PDNE|4|This device is awesome!!!  I can watch and manage netflix pic and music through my phone. I  didn't give it 5 stars because they don't have enough apps. but over all this is a great device!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Game keeps your interest.
B000QCS8TW|5|Greatest thing since harry potter
B006MW3UZW|5|It just keeps getting better with every episode!  I found myself close to tears many times!  I'm already on my way through Season 3, I'm going to have withdraw soon!
B001E75QH0|5|Lookng for a good Christmas present?  This is it!  (if you don't already have it, of course.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5|When watching this series,there are happy times ,sad times,but it was like stepping back in time. A wonderful experience to see.
B001ECQ75A|2|We missed this one at the theaters and all four of my kids were disappointed. I promised them that as soon as it was released on DVD that I would buy it. Promise kept, movie delivered, and....they were disappointed. All the hype around the movie and all the anticipation of the movie wasn't really worth it. They were disappointed. It just wasn't that funny and it was pretty boring. If my kids find time to fight about something in the middle of a movie, then I know the movie was not the entertaining.
B007V2UGPE|5|this is a great app I play it all the time. if your still trying to decide about getting it then your wasting time.
0790729733|4|This is an excellent film.  Because it makes you think, and rethink, the facts.  I don't understand how anyone could be CONVINCED Oswald was the lone gunman.  There is so much doubt everywhere you look.  And that is ALL  Stone asks his audience to do with this film: question the facts as  presented by the government, who's case is pretty flimsy.  By his own  admission, Stone has referred to JFK as an &quot;alternate myth&quot;.  He  doesn't know.  But if you look at all the facts, you can't help but be led  in other directions.  I think he does a pretty good job of busting up the  government's story, if not creating his own.
B002MW50KO|5|I bought this CD a few weeks ago, and I wasn't impressed at first.    I am a fan of Bob Dylan (from Freewheelin' to Infidels to Highway 61 to Love and Theft, etc. etc.) and I am a fan of Christmas music (from Vince Guaraldi to Phil Spector to James Brown to Elvis and Frank and Connie and Dean and etc. etc.) so I was *really* READY for a Bob Dylan Christmas album.  But, what I found after listening to this CD a couple of times with headphones on is that it is NOT a headphone album, it's a ROOMFUL album.  I played it this morning over regular old stereo speakers in a room full of people, and it really opened up.  It was like having the coolest uncle in the world plainly singing along to the greatest band and greatest backing vocalists in the world.    It would be like YOU or ME singing along to the greatest band and greatest backing singers in the world.  It would make us stretch out and make a truly awesome Christmas album, without the normal strings attached.  Wouldn't that be awesome?    ISN'T that awesome?  Regards,  V.
0802130208|5|Obese, pedantic and hopelessly eccentric, Ignatius J. Reilly stands like Gargantua over all other characters in modern literature. He leads us on a series of his misfit adventures through the French Quarter of New Orleans. Age 30 and living with his mother, he is an over-educated oaf who sits around the house watching TV with disgust and laboriously filling up 'Big Chief' tablets with his reflections on life. His rantings on the world of work, love, religion and other topics leave no one safe from his fiery invective.    His pseudo long-distance relationship with a liberated feminist named Myrna Minkoff reveals his attachment to his mother's apron strings. Stereotypical characterizations of other minor characters give the reader a balanced cornucopia of madness and genius. Comic relief is the order of the day in this brilliant novel. I absolutely loved it!
B002QE3CTY|5|I love this book and I'm telling you that its way better than the movie.... the book and the movie have to many differences that I didn't understand what happen in both so watch it after it you can do!!! Hope you enjoy this book just like I did!
B0091REZMW|5|I reached level thirty, and then the game totally died on me, I reinstalled finally but lost all my progress/friends, was disappointing, especially as it takes a long time to level up etc. Anyway I still recommend this game, it has kept my interest, it has lots of levels and quests to keep you occupied and you don't have to pay to play.A definate download people!!!
B00FATEJYE|5|It really is a free game! You CAN buy coins so you can get in-game stuff easier but it's not needed, great game, I would reccomend it to anyone.
B009IRVSVQ|5|Love love love it!!!! You won't be disappointed. Gorilla is my favorite song right now but the entire CD is great! The End!!
1573226521|5|I took this book with me on a recent vacation to southern Florida.  Once I began to read, I found it so engaging that for two days I chose to stay inside and devour it, all the while neglegting the calls of Florida's  actual beaches.  Garland writes with such honesty that I found it  incredibly easy to identify with the main character Richard, violent  hallucinations aside.  On the surface, &quot;The Beach&quot; is a thrilling  adventure novel, set in the mellow atmosphere of a remote island and  marijuana smoke.  Look deeper, and you find a parallel to Vietnam that  reminds me of the &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; -&quot;Apocalypse  Now.&quot;  Most of all, this novel sparked within me a dangerous desire to  leave my normal life behind and set out on some crazy adventure to  Thailand.  If you're looking for a quick, exciting read with some deep  inner meaning, visit &quot;The Beach.&quot;
B008XG1X18|4|Good ideas
B0021L8V1Q|3|Seems like less action & more talk than the first one. Mickey Rourke was good though. Worth watching, but not the beat super hero flick.
B00JVZ0DQG|3|Keeps me busy!
B00992CF6W|5|Absolutely LOVE this app. It is by far worth the money. Must get this app. It is the best sandbox game ever.
B0000AQS0F|5|Not that 14 episodes is bad, well it is since this is a great series. I just always thought I missed the rest of the series, as to what many people say about it being grainy... Thats the point. Its suppose to. It kind of adds to the feel of the series... Trying not to give to many spoilers. I got hooked after I watched Serenity this is a great series and glad I got this. Mine was a slim case however, not that thats a bad thing but from the picture it looks like its not the slim case. 4 disk with added bonus features which honestly I don't watch... Just the kind of fan I am...
B009IEXKXI|4|Laid up in bed for the a month and doing a lot of reading, so far this book is my favorite! It is a really great adventure story. Weir keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. A bit technical in places but he handles it well.
B009LQKHIO|5|Really enjoyed the storyline in this book. Made me want to read the next one inn the series but my current budget input allows for free books right now. Maybe will look in library.
B00470TOV0|4|I am really not a fan of blood, guts, testosterone driven movies, but I do love this movie.  Perhaps because there is an actual story line or because there is some inclusion of real (not to say strictly accurate) history of the Roman Empire, it is one of few modern movies that is a 'go to' when broadcast on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  Decided I should really own it; the snob in me justifying the 2 hours of eye candy Russell Crowe, with smugness of having read Marcus Aurelius, let alone knowing who he was!
B009FZHYKU|5|I just love Walking Dead! This is one of the best series to ever come on Tv! I heard about the show late, and we went through all 4 seasons in a few weeks. Looking forward to season 5!
B000T433CO|2|This movie was recommended by a friend.<br /><br />Watched it and was very disappointment. The movie lacks in many regards. Might work for some people but I prefer a movie that is a bit deeper and with a better script that will challenge me or at least draw some emotions from me throughout the movie.<br /><br />Don't recommend it.
B001JP5JRY|5|Laughed the whole way ... And some of them are kinda true, just funnier. Men and women should read this
B000002TQV|5|Probably the best of the three Radiohead Albums, this really is a great album. A must for any music lover.
B008JFUQZ2|5|Good.
B000001E18|5|Most people I've spoken to have either thought this was an absolute must for any album collection, or should be used as a coaster.<br />Personally, I find it an extraordinary invention of sound and music that broke new ground.  If you liked the singles &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;, you won't be able to turn this cd off.  It helps if you went to one of the ZooTV concerts or have heard remixes of these songs, as that's the only way you'll appreciate just how brilliant this album is - anything that can be remixed a number of times in different genres and sound so spectacular across the board is very rare.<br />Equal to &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; for my tastes, and that's a big wrap.
B0000DD7NL|5|Beautiful... gorgeous... exquisit... decadent... just what you'd expect from the godess of popular music
B00VMQK37Q|5|It was a gift for a friend who was delighted with it
B00GAVJ77K|1|Made me lose my key pad and volume worset App ever!!! I had to factory reset my kindle fire
6305127638|5|In my opinion, this is the best of the Star Trek films. It has everything! If you like any Star Trek film, series or action film, you will love this film. Although I am a huge Star Trek fan, I believe this will appeal to the none-fan as well. Hell. I think everyone will love this film! It appealed to me because it has the two main things that appeal to me in Star Trek. The Borg and time travel, in that order. This film is a must see
B00NM7K7NI|5|Everything you would expect in a Godzilla movie.<br />The best of the Godzilla genre.<br />Bring lots of popcorn, turn up the bass, and let Godzilla roar!
B00000JG41|5|California is the most accesible album by the infamous group known as Mr. Bungle(R.I.P). Arguably their best album out of the three major release. Combining their taste for the abstract/jazz/metal/funk/eastern and traditional flavors as well as a California Surf style that bands like the Beach Boys poularized. Using traditional instruments and non-traditional instruments, Mike Patton and the boys have crafted a masterpiece that spans over various genres and styles and breaks all boundries and pushes the envelope of amazing music way past its limit. Amazing musicianship and creative melodies and beautiful crooning make this album a true treat to listen to. I would argue that this is their BEST album period. Having the ability to tatke abstract and structure and mash them together is a talent that is hard to come by. Mr.Bungle have a style all their own, and despite all the many copycats, there are NONE that can emulate Mr.Bungle's style and grace. The many tempo changes and style changes throughout songs is phenomenal! <br />Sweet Charity has a Beach Boys/Hawaiian style to it, very cool and the singing is like over the top dramatic style. It's amazing. <br />None of them knew they were robots is stright up swing with abstractities thrown in. Then name speaks for itself. <br />Retrovirtigo has a nice chilled out vibe. <br />The Air-conditioned nightmare is another Beach Boy's style sound with beautiful vocals. <br />Ars meriendi has a middle eastern feel to it mixed with rock, an awesome song with reggae breakdowns and high speeds. <br />Pink Cigarette has a 50's style doo wop sound and is very creepy and haunting. Amazing crooning by Mr. Patton <br />Golem II: The bionic vapour boy is a mysterious and eerie sort of chanting tune, very good and spine chilling. <br />The Holy Filament has a funky, electronic abstact feel. <br />Vanity fair has a 50's doo wop sound, a great feel good song with awesome vocals <br />Goodbye sober day is a funky song that has a fierce chanting breakdown in the middle of the song. <br />This album is a MUST own, it defines music as a whole and is the definitive Mr.Bungle album. If you have never heard of Mr. Bungle before, pick this one up! Their other two albums are great as well. Their first release is much more SKA with more horns and a little rap influence, and their second release is their most abstract with more synth, organs and off the wall antics.
B00BTHWFBK|5|Good album. Sad to know one has cancer. Seen them live a week ago. Ozzy in rare form and covered album well.
