B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have found that rhis game is pretty pointless to say rhe least. However it is exaxtly what it promises to be. I coin pusher. You earn prices points and coins so you can throw them down and have uthem pushed in a pit so you can earn more. I gave it five stars because it delivers what it promised just not what I want in a game. lol

B0094BB4TW|1.0|I love my kindle fire and liked th fact that I could put the facebook app in my favorites are leave it on my catty for easy access. Now I have to do the facebook login, and restle with whether or not I will be able to read what is on my facebook. Yes, I know I can pinch the screen but then the pics are out of line. The facebook app made it easier all around. I have been waiting for two or three weeks for Amazon and facebook to fix this.<br /><br />The truth is, facebook has to fix it and then Amazon when they get an app that works right, will make the update availabe to us. Really thoigh, what did I expect from facebook anyway. They send out updates and they are always worse than tje last one. That happened on my phone all the time.<br />problems as of now<br />Stops showing news feed after a few post, cant like anything, comments dont take, refresher does not work and the list goes on.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always like a John Grisham novel. This one wasn't a disappointment! If you are a fan of suspense, then you'll enjoy Grisham's description of how the main character, The Racketeer, got around the legal system. Enjoy!

8876250441|5.0|Yes! I am a 73-year-old male. And, yes! I am very much aware that this series is targeted to a DIFFERENT age group than I fall in. Nonetheless, Stephanie Meyer has created a very romantic and captivating series of stories. And this final [? <smile>] volume of the series is EXCELLENT in so many different ways! Truly, Ms. Stephanie Meyer is as gifted as her heroine turns out to be. It is simply a very good book that I found to be a page-turner.

B009A9EPLM|2.0|Like most of John Williams' recent scores, this one is just as dull and boring as the rest. It's technically okay and I'm sure it works well while watching the actual film, but as music on its own, it's just your atypical John Williams from the last 15 years or so. Background music that builds to a dramatic, over the top swelling, followed by a low key solo piano version of that dramatic over the top swelling, etc. There's just nothing special at all about this score, it's completely interchangeable with just about any of his recent scores. I like Mr. Williams and always hope for the best with his work, but man, lately it's just been dullsville. Sorry to say- this is more of the same.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book.  Grisham does another fantastic job.  You never really know where the book is going to take you.  Endings are always a supprise with this author.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|This amazing cast is just splendid,  all consummate actors, they give this story its heart and soul. Had to own this movie.
B006DZYM0A|2.0|I get it: it's a chick flick.<br /><br />The absurdity of the premise -- the girl distracts the bus driver, he goes through a red light and kills a woman, and for the rest of the movie the girl wants to punish the bus driver instead of punishing herself -- that's the mark of the chick flick. The lack of logic, and the presumption that we will sit through two and a half hours without getting bored by this lack of logic.<br /><br />When Matt Damon kisses her, that's the seal of approval: CHICK FLICK.<br /><br />One extra star for the actress who plays the mother, who is wonderful.

0812984412|4.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is an inventive work of fiction that revolves around the lives of six individuals living in different time periods from the 19th century to the distant future.  It jumps back and forth in time, and as a result, requires the reader to work somewhat to keep the stories straight.  But it is well worth the effort.  As the book builds to its climax, the reader is swept up in all of the lives until the final chapter when all is tied together.  I will not reveal the conclusion, but the ending is very rewarding and fulfilling.

0374214913|4.0|Mister Penumbra is mostly a joy.  If you can make this connection without blowing a fuze, put your mind around a deft amalgam of The DaVinci Code (but with humor)and John Barth.  (Primarily,the John Barth of Giles Goat Boy.)  I found the quest/premise fascinating, even though my lack of computer skills probably got in my way some.  The narrative keeps on building suspense, but I felt a growing lack of enthusiam on the writer's part in the second half.  When I am panting for progress, the writer seems to be snoozing.  Still, I can't wait for this writer's next work and I hope he is not the \\"one and done\\" type of novelist. Buy it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The weather has to be not so cold but for me to still wear dresses before I outgrow my dresses.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I admit that I might have rated Rango as only four stars if not to compensate for the many misguided reviews of those longing for insincere love songs, obligatory romances, and energy drinks. This film is not for them. Rango is art, as all films should be. It is meant to stimulate the human desire for poetry and a supernatural understanding of the world. That may sound dramatic, but thoughtful children's films are so precious, and Rango is one.<br /><br />I fully expected, as most did, to witness another mindless drudge of a children's animation in the same vein as Pixar's Finding Nemo, but thank God for film makers who use their brains! The dialog shines as the characters share insightful idioms and clever references. At no point is there a wasted line of dialog. Most of what is said will go over the heads of young children - and clearly adults who never read - but there is enough silly humor to incite genuine laughter. Adults will gasp giddily at the sharp innuendo and provocative language, but again, it is subtle enough that children will only know that something humorous was said. If you aren't receptive to the steady stream of wit that pours from each word, then, yes, you very well may be bored because much of the film is carried by John Logan's fascinating script. The plot leaves much to be desired, and is merely used as a backdrop for some abstract philosophical concepts and the atypical delivery of children's entertainment. It didn't bother me.<br /><br />The animation is outstanding, but more than that, the imagery is full of expression. The film's charm is elevated by crisp animation and a deliberate art direction. The feel of Rango is unique, and may come across as edgy, but the universe that is inhabited by charming creatures is far more convincing than what films like Avatar or Monsters Inc. even came close to achieving.<br /><br />The creators of Rango meant to make a children's feature that was more than just a cute story about the power of love and friendship; they wanted to make something that actually mattered. The problem is, a lot of people can't grasp the necessity for enriching every aspect of life so that we can all broaden our understanding a littler wider. As a child, I would have appreciated the magnitude of what the film makers were attempting to accomplish, and the world could do better if all children were the same. It saddens me that so many adults who find their way onto Amazon.com are so resistant to what artists are trying to achieve for the human race. If you found that you weren't in-tuned to the higher meaning of the film, then you should probably put down 50 Shades of Grey and pick up Charles Dickens.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I enjoyed very much in spite of I am Japanese. I could understand approximately half of English. However, I could have a wonderful time by good film.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Like all the other reviewers here, I am a Ken Follett fan and have read all of his previous books. Also like almost all the other reviews, I really enjoyed the first book of this trilogy, I even re-read it in advance of getting this book. Overall, I would say that I liked this book, but it was certainly not among his best works.<br /><br />First, I thought the new characters brought out in this second book were fairly well phased in...there were probably several instances in the separate stories that will make you feel that the individual stories are a little too hoaky. The author certainly takes a lot of liberty with the 'it's a small world' situations, but I can allow for that in order to keep the connections between the different families going. I found that I liked most of the new main characters, but I seemed to have missed what happened to some of the old characters...such as Walter's parents...I will go back and see if I skipped over that.  Some of the decisions made by the different characters made me scratch my head in wonder, but I guess you have to allow some leeway for story direction. You can see that one of the problems with this book is that you have to make a lot of allowances which is not typical of his (Follett's) other books.  I think that I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in that if this had not been a Ken Follett book, I might not have stuck it out to the end.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that the author apparently felt the need to tag my Navy as the gay branch. And, while on the sexual topic...why did we need all the 'adult' scenes?  The story doesn't need that...at least be a little less graphic.  To me it just seems to cheapen the book and seems to me a laziness on the author's part to fill pages.<br /><br />I enjoyed the historical references throughout the book and thought that they were well done.  I know that a lot of comments were made about not spending more time on the different events or missing some altogether, but this would have had to be a considerably larger book in order to do so. Mr. Follett did a good job to hit some key areas of the time period and keep the story moving along.<br /><br />I look forward to the next book, I hope that it is somewhat more like the first book.

B008OOYALE|5.0|fun game keeps me occupied while waiting runs great on kindle fire. my son loves the sounds and is very pretty
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I have the impression it is a bit stronger than the free version.<br />You have good options such as handicaps, timed games, save and load game and can choose from several board styles and 10 difficulty levels.<br />However, it looks to me that after an aggressive opening and a good midgame it slacks off towards late midgame.<br />For an average chess player like me this means if I survive the initial assault I win - it's almost as if the AI gets tired.<br />It would be nice if you could force a particular opening but it's not essential.<br />I recommend this program though I think Rival Chess is stronger.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|The Name of the Wind is my favourite book. When I was reading it I was sometimes scared that Rothfuss would make some misstep and spoil it. He didn't.<br /><br />With The Wise Man's Fear I've lost that fear. I trust him.

B009PU2SX8|3.0|This highly anticipated release just doesn't live up to the hype.  I was very excited to get this album after seeing him perform at jazz fest this year! He is a guitar virtuoso  reminiscent of Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn. The album just does not deliver this man's amazing talent. I expected blues and instead the album is pop.???  WTF. It includes another version of \\"Bright Lights\\", but the rest of the material seems uninspired. Shame.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Purchased the Prometheus (Blu-ray 3D/ Blu-ray/ DVD/ Digital Copy) and would give it a solid 4.5 stars. Don't have 3D TV yet, but the blu-ray is spectacular. Really enjoyed the movie; excellent cinematography (especially the opening scene), special effects, really enjoyed the cast (especially Fassbender and Rapace) and storyline. Also thoroughly enjoyed the extras including watching the movie with Director Scott's insights which I highly recommend. A case can be made for and against the movie (tried to do too much, not enough, prequel, etc), but I gave myself up to just enjoying Ridley Scott's vision. I hope you do too. Look forward to the sequel(s).
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Fantastic movie!! I'm not a movie critic so to try to go indepth about it seems silly. But this movie has a better story line and cast than a lot of the new movies that are coming out today!
0316228532|1.0|To me, the mark of a good book, is if the writer can draw me in, making me want to read on with anticipation; I want to be apart of the little world that is created in a book!  However, with this book, I just wanted to get away, it was dull and full of characters with no redeeming qualities...I kept saying to myself, 'it'll get better', yet by chapter 10 I still had not found one thing that made me want to continue reading this book and I finally said to myself.....life is to short to continue reading bad novels when there are so many good ones out there.

B008O69SZ0|5.0|This CD is the best I've heard all year, perhaps the best in several years.  Ian Hunter is a terrific singer and songwriter who has gotten stronger over the years.  Probably best known for his work with Mott the Hoople and his cover of Bowie's All the Young Dudes in the 1970's, Hunter has never stopped trying to put the very best lyrics with the very best rock n roll to make timeless classics.  Simply put, When I'm President shows Hunter at the top of his game with a terrific band performing perhaps the best album of his career.

Oh yeah, and all that fun creepy stuff. When I say that its warm, well, you do get to care about the story people in the end, and it does have a feel of resolution to it, which I personally prefer in stories.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not much of a tv person. Came across a rerun of season 1 episode 101 at my fathers house and have been a walker junkie ever since. I've always enjoyed zombies but this is so much more than just the flesh eating freaks. It depicts what daily life would actually be like in a zombie apocolypse. Sure there's plenty of gore but the real heart pounding scenes are about the human condition of survival.  Excellent work Kirkman!

1444737090|5.0|A Street Cat Named Bob is the story of James Bowen and his cat Bob who one day mysteriously showed up almost on his doorstep.  A most interesting story, not at all the type of book I thought this would be.  James starts taking care of Bob, feeding him and taking him to the vet for a few problems.  After he gets Bob fixed he lets him loose outside so he could go back to his roaming ways.  Turns out Bob didn't want to roam any more.  Bob and James became very attached to each other with both of them kind of starting out a new life together.  The part of the story that surprised me was that James was starting to get back on his feet after dealing with a history of drug addiction.  He does a very good job describing addiction and what it will do to your life.  Seems to me that Bob and James found each other at a time when they both needed each other.  A lovely and touching story that gives you a lot to think about.  An excellent read.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I got this book on a whim and haven't read John Grisham's work in awhile. I was pleasantly surprised to see another action packed book.

B004SBX112|1.0|The birds aren't the only ones that are angry.  First of all I like this game.  You, the fan of angry birds asks then:  Why am I giving it a one star?  This is why.  After countless hours of getting 3 stars on each level on seasons They decided to do an update, and they wipe out all my progress.  This update was on the 11th of November 2012, and I'm one of many affected.  Everything I had accomplished was wiped out in a single stroke.  Like I said, it's a great game and I love it, but this is a one star review for a 5 star game simply because I'm angry for the total disregard of the work people put into these games.  When I get an explanation as to why mine and everyone else's progress was deleted at the touch of a button, and if I'm satisfied as to the reason then I'll happily come back and give the game the 5 stars it deserves.  If it was an accident, then I'll come back and give it 5 stars.<br />Written by an agry piggie.

B0049VZ222|5.0|The Walking Dead Season one was amazing. Not to many other words to describe it. Very fine acting, great layouts, a good storyline, and good twists. Not much more can be asked out of a first season of a new program. Best part was it wasn't over the top like many are and it focused more on the characters than just killing zombies like many other zombie movies. Very nice balance of everything going on.
1609613937|1.0|As an academic researcher and an avid follower of nutrition science, I was excited to buy this book and to read about (as the book description told me) the scientifically-based rebuttals it made to contemporary \\"fad\\" high protein diets. I found nothing of the sort within the pages of this book.<br /><br />Rather, what I found was a series of unfounded statements and faulty logic. Many of the authors' most important arguments about how our ancestors ate or about how we should be eating today cite either bad/outdated science, websites(!), or nothing at all. The personally-motivated stance of the authors makes it hard to determine which evidence is credible and which isn't.<br /><br />There are also innumerable highly misleading (and in many occasions just plain wrong) \\"facts\\" that the authors use to try to establish the superiority of starch over protein. Many of these fly in the face of established research. I'll name just a couple. In comparing the caloric profile of \\"starch\\" vs. \\"meat\\", they state that starch has 1 calorie per gram and that \\"meat\\" has 4. The authors of course give no definition of what these starch or meat products actually are. Their caloric profile could be true if you compare a yam to a fatty piece of bacon, but I can just as easily make the opposite claim: a skinless chicken breast has or piece of fish has less than 1 calorie per gram whereas wheat flour has about 3.5 calories per gram. They also show a pie chart that implies that a typical american's diet consists of 70% meat and dairy (whether they mean as a percent of calories or total foodstuff they don't indicate). Not surprisingly, they cite nothing for this highly inaccurate figure; from my understanding less than a third of American's calories come from animal protein and dairy, and the majority (50%+) come from added fats and carbohydrates. The authors also list protein and fat as \\"toxins\\"... just one of the many scientifically irresponsible statements in the book.<br /><br />Although there are several good arguments to be leveled against contemporary diets and high-protein diets, you won't find any novel ones in this book. Very disappointing.there are several good arguments to be leveled against contemporary diets and high-protein diets, you won't find any novel ones in this book. Very disappointing.

1595141979|3.0|Shadow Kiss is the third book in the Vampire Academy series by Richelle Mead.  It picks up shortly after returning to St. Vladimir's post kidnapping and Mason's death.  Rose is preparing for graduation, doing her field experience and trying to recover mentally from what happened during the kidnapping.  During a field experience exercise Rose freezes when she believes she see Masons ghost.  As per usual, Rose doesn't tell anyone what she thinks she saw fearing everyone will think she is crazy.<br /><br />Shadow Kiss started a little slow for me.  Parts of the field experience could have been a little more exciting.  Lissa is annoying and needy.  She claims to be Rose's BFF but she really knows nothing about what is going on in Rose's life.<br /><br />Shadow Kiss really redeems itself a little more than half way through.  All of Rose's beans are spilled and there is a lot of action and Strigoi slaying going on.  Not to mention the huge game changer at the end.<br /><br />I will definitely read the next book in this series.  There was a huge cliffhanger and I HAVE to find out what happened.

0345495004|4.0|This historical novel is a well written, well researched story of the seven year affair between a married woman and a married Frank Lloyd Wright. The book started out as just a report on the clandestine affair, with chapters filled with Frank and Mamah's secret meetings. However, the story gradually added so much more depth and interest. By the time I finished reading the book, I had learned quite a bit about Frank Lloyd Wright, the man (an impulsive, ambitious, romantic, self-centered and impractical person) and his architecture. I did not know much about FLW before reading this book, and now I am thinking about touring some of his buildings. So I appreciate the story of this book, and am grateful that it has opened my eyes to a new interest. Well worth reading, especially the second half.

B008BM9L72|1.0|It was a big mistake I have not made for many years. I looked for easy reading with an opportunity to expand my knowledge of English and for some fun after hard work over Ulysses and other serious books. Unfortunately, \\"50 shades\\" has not fulfill my expectations. The vocabulary the author uses is limited by words which describe facial expression, copulation and goods which does not make much of interest to me since I am not going to purchase a helicopter, a catamaran or Christian Louboutin's shoes. In case of wealthy life exposure I prefer to watch comedies or con men stories. For love stories i prefer real literature. Like T.Hardy. Even if it is not the first edition.<br />I am also very curious about some details.<br />First of all: How could it become possible that the girl who graduates the university in 2011 and plans to become a journalist has NO notebook??? How is it possible that a modern university student has NO notebook? HOW? Explain to me it, dear writer!<br />My second question is: How is it possible that such a wealthy man has not been followed by paparazzi to disclose his personal life? How could no one knew about his girls, about his \\"Audi\\" gifts? How the man with such money was able to live in shade and be not noticed by mass media???<br />I see written parodies on this book. I have not read any but I am sure - there is no need to write a parody - the book itself is a parody on real literature.<br />If i had only known!!! I would've spent my money on much wiser purchase.

Introverts and Extroverts are the \\"types\\" of people we have been talking about every since language was invented. We say he/she is really \\"to themselves\\" is a way of identifying someone who is introverted; however, it is not always that obvious. The outgoing, talkative and very social person tends to be categorized as an extrovert. The truth is that we all have a bit of both within us!<br /><br />There are many parts of our thinking that, strangely enough, eludes our perceptions at times only to be seen clearer later on in retrospect. Each one of us is unique, multifaceted, and have this great cascade of parts of our personality that play a large role in the kind of life we live. Susan focuses on going with the grain instead of against it concerning our natures, to embrace who we are, which results in a more productive and compassionate society.
B007REV4T8|3.0|I suppose this is a good action film. But, is it a good Bond film? That remains to be seen. With time, I see that this really is not a good Bond film. Time has a way of putting  things in perspective. The publicity people spread the word that this would be classic Bond befitting his 50th screen anniversary of the series. I honestly did not feel this was a classic Bond film. It seemed like one big long action-chase film that just got so tiresome. This film is not uplifting. It is rather dreary and a feeling of melancholy permeates the entire film. I did not get that feeling of electricity at the end of SKYFALL as I and the audience did at the end of CASINO ROYALE. There are some good concepts presented in this film and a few welcome surprises. And there is one scene that is in fact pure Bond, classic Bond. I was thankful for that. I am thankful for all the good friendships and acquaintances I have made through my association with Bond over these 50 years. It is good to see how Bond has evolved on the screen in that time. Hope you enjoy SKYFALL. In retrospect, I didn't. Reflect on it I suppose.<br /><br />On another note, I saw this film in both the standard theatrical release and the IMAX version as well. The aspect ratios are definitely different. The IMAX aspect ration was closer to a standard 4 x 3 instead of the usual widescreen. I found the IMAX version somewhat enjoyable and contemplative for some reason. And, and I cannot believe I am saying this, put the gun barrel back at the beginning of the film. It really would have made a difference on this film.

1451648537|4.0|The best part of the book was the end where it concludes with some thoughts by Steve Jobs, in his own words. I would have liked to have more of this conversation from Jobs imbedded in the entire book so as to better feel what made this genius tick. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Computer, quoted Henry Ford: \\"If I had asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, `A faster horse!' \\"<br /><br />Jobs continues, \\"People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.<br /><br />The readers continue to learn many things about Jobs, such as the Blue Box adventure that \\"established a template for a partnership that would soon be born. Wozniak would be the gentle wizard coming up with a neat invention that he would have been happy just to give away, and Jobs would figure out how to make it user-friendly, put it together in a package, market it, and make a few bucks.\\" We learn that Jobs was adopted, that he immersed in Eastern spirituality and Zen Buddhism, and spent time in India.<br /><br />Everything that happened in Job's life contributed to his ability to create future Apple products and to run his company. He was not a normal person, and that is probably a definition of a genius. At times he was very mean and uncaring toward people. He would not suffer fools, and insisted in having only the best people working for him. Average people were never hired or were quickly fired. Steve Jobs became the greatest business executive of our time and built the largest company in the world. No one else could have built it, even though they all had the same starting point and help from society.  History will remember him as one of the greats, along with Edison and Ford.<br />[...]
034580404X|4.0|The books that I ordered were just what I expected.  Nice and in perfect shape.  The story line didn't live up to all the hype as far as the \\"adult content\\" goes.  However, it is a good read.  I would recommend it.
B000IVVRWG|3.0|The copy I received was in good enough shape, but it was not an early edition as the illustration implied. \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" can be a frustrating book to buy, as the American editions originally were published without the final chapter, and used booksellers seldom make a distinction. Such was the case here.  I've handed the book off and will be more careful looking for a complete edition from now on.

0446604844|5.0|This book grabs you from page one. Looked forward to reading it each day. His characters are believable and interesting. His knowledge of background information shows a lot of research. You will enjoy this book.  His style is similar to John Grisham.

B0071AKB38|4.0|This is a great wireless speaker if the only thing that you care about is having extremely good sound quality in a wireless speaker.  The sound quality is truly amazing!  It's much easier to bring just the speaker from room to room than bringing a wired speaker that is connected to your phone.  I use an Android phone and have a distance range of about 40 feet before the bluetooth speaker starts breaking up.<br /><br />This speaker does contain a microphone that theoretically can be used for phone calls but I have found that it only works if you talk very loudly while holding the speaker right next to your mouth.  Not very practical. You would be much better off using your phone's built in microphone and external speaker for a hands free call.  Bottom line, if all you care about is awesome sound quality in a wireless speaker get it.  Otherwise keep looking for another product.

B009NPKTN6|5.0|This movie is a delightful and hilarious voyage back to the eighties hairband days. Paul G., Tom Cruise , Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand have so much fun ROCKING their performances. You cannot help but to sing along loudly by the end. We loved it!

0425263908|3.0|I was very disappointed that the author chose to \\"in my opinion\\" rename the characters and call it original. This was plagiarism at it best.  However, I did enjoy Gideon and Eva's relationship they seem better suited for each other since they had similar backgrounds. The second book in this series 'Reflected in You' is a much better read that takes you on a twist an turn ride, that has you antispating the arriveral of the third book, 'Entwined with You'.
B0086700CM|5.0|really people this is a great game and it works just fine. I don't know why you are hating on this game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game, used to be boring for me, because I didn't know how to breed. When my best friend told me how to do it, it became my favorite game!
0307454894|4.0|The tragedy surrounding the characters was touching. Although I am sensitive to the holocaust issue, I felt extreme sympathy towards the female character, and through her, all like her--males or females. The Eros was there, and there was an wholesome honesty and humanity in that whole aspect of eros used in the story.<br />In a way, this book has something to say about a trend in German intellectual mind, at least about a segment of it.<br />I have yet to see the movie, and am pondering if I should or not.<br />If you have already seen the movie, you may have a different expectations.<br />As for being convoluted, I suspect it has to do with the translation--not necessarily a fault of translator, but something gets lost in translation, always. Some lines or paragraphs I had to reread to get the drift or the sense. The story telling was good despite that. One can easily visualize the scenes as a black-white film.<br />I recommend it. Three and half stars would be best, but I saw the writer's interview with Charlie Rose and Amazon does not allow three and half. So four star it is. It does not deserve less than 3.5 stars, possibly more in your judgment. Give it a go.

0345803485|1.0|After all the hype, I was interested in reading this book. What a disappointment. I'm no prude but I thought it was smut & about a young girl who was victimized. Love story? Indeed not. Don't make this author rich by buying her books.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow! is all I can say.  Prepare to lose sleep, because this is an up all night page turner.  Ms. Steele does act Childish, which can be irritating.
B005HEU4L4|5.0|This 2-part episode is the most intensely acted of Season 6, and perhaps of all of ST:TNG, with a stellar performance by Patrick Stewart that reminds us of his talent and classic theater background.<br /><br />It's also unusually brutal, and doesn't shy away from the subject of torture (not a usual topic for TV fiction).  While the episode's backstory is a bit contrived, twenty years after it was filmed, it still remains touching and relevant.<br /><br />I'm rewatching all of ST:TNG with the GF in sequence, years after seeing them sporadically when they first aired.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I literally whent through mourning after I was done reading, I so needed to continue reading about these characters.  That Mr. Grey, is true fantasy!
B004UPALT6|5.0|Put simply, this movie is an absolute shinning example of how a horror/comdie movie is done. It delivers on both elements completly. Bruce Campbell is legendary for his role here and in Evil Dead and Army of Darkness (films 1 and 3 in the tri-ology)as Ash who's primary bullet point on his resume is \\"Slayer of the Evil Dead\\". Sam Raimi wrote (along with Scott Spiegel) and direceted this flick. There are so many memorable lines and scenes in this film, it's foolish to list them all. If you've never heard of or like this film, you're not a horror fan. This movie is a timeless masterpiece for horror fans.
B004SBX112|1.0|Really loved this version for. 99 UNTIL update of Nov. 9 wiped out all previous levels (2011 &amp; 2012) and reset game to minimum purchase 3 levels.  Total rip off. Where is what I paid for?
B0051T46XM|5.0|I had held off on this Norwegian horror-fantasy because of the subtitles,  until I rented it on Xbox Live (dubbed version only). I bought it asap on Blu-ray the next week. I have not watched the dubbed version yet (new to the disc version), the subtitled version is the version I first saw. It's about a section of Norway that is secretly home to giant trolls. I know it sounds stupid, but they absolutely pull it off in spades. This movie is directly comparable to Jurrasic Park; similiar builds ups, style of footage and shocks - but with Giant Trolls. I never in my life thought that trolls would ever be anything other than stupid, but they pull it off here special effects wise and plot wise. Extremely well done, very highly recommended. I realy can't say enough good things about this flick. Giant scary trolls kick ass.

B00902MCVY|5.0|I'm starting to lose my \\"I don't normally write reviews\\" street cred by writing my third review, but I just want to begin this review by saying that I don't normally write reviews. However, every so often a product comes along that demands review!<br /><br />Time I is a beautiful album.  It's a symphony.  It has some great riffs.  It has rhythms that make you grit your teeth, clench your fist, and bang your head while also forcing you to play the album for people who don't even like the genre and say, \\"Shh... shh... now listen to this part!  You see?!!!  Listen to that!\\"  And they're like, \\"Yes, um, that's very nice...\\"<br /><br />The album is a soaring experience.  Many of the melodies reach up for the stars.  While the ravages of time are the main lyrical theme of the album, what makes it so moving is the hope that is communicated relentlessly by the ascending melodies.<br /><br />Wintersun is such an appropriate name for this band.  What can be bleaker than the death of a desolate winter day?  And yet what can be more beautiful than the sun shining on the pristine snow of a desolate winter day with the hope that spring will come?<br /><br />Uh oh, it looks like I've become a bit maudlin here.  But, you know what?  That's the beauty of this album!  It lets us release the shackles of our postmodern ironic prison and enjoy some music on a pure, emotional level.  Time fades away.  But Time is here!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case holds the KFHD nice and snug. Some of the early reviews state that the magnetic sleep/wake feature only works with the camera on the right, they must have updated that because mine works either way. Camera on the left works better because you can plug in the charger with the case closed that way. The feel of the case is nice and the elastic strap to keep the cover closed is very useful.  When using the case as a stand it sits nice and firm and you can adjust the angle easily as advertised.  This really is a great buy and at 45% off the price of the amazon case value is amazing.  Highly recommend!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Not for me! Maybe if I played with somebody who knows the game already it would be different. I couldnt get off two blocks, so it didnt hold my interest.
1400069289|5.0|The real strength of the book lies in the beginning 2/3 and the fascinating case studies on the importance, development and maintenance of habits of all kind. One should probably reserve a healthy skepticism for the grand sweep of the book, extending a basic theory of how habits work all the way from the domain of the single individual to vast organizations. But Duhigg lays out a simple, memorable and mostly useful model of habits that gives the reader a fresh way to look at the &#34;programmable&#34; automatic behaviors that get all of us through the day.<br /><br />Duhigg tries to end the book with come concrete advice on habit formation, but that part mostly fell flat for me. Still, what led up to it is excellent and wins a 5-star rating from me.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is cool but sometimes it gets boring and I hate the fact that u have to pay for some things.
0374275637|5.0|Essentially a layman's one-volume summary of Kahneman's professional career, this book is a fascinating tour through the myriad ways your mind really works when you are making decisions and engaged in other cognitive tasks. If you are interested in education, economic decision making, politics or just generally curious about your own mental life, do yourself a favor and buy this book. And the key word here is &#34;buy,&#34; because if you're like me you will want to re-read it.

B00004R99U|4.0|This 1998 straight-to-video sequel to Disney's 1995 feature \\"Pocahontas\\", plays fast and loose with historical fact (much like the original film) but has good intentions at it's core.  The quality of the animation is quite lush and the participation of many of the original voice artists helps viewers transition effortlessly into this second \\"Pocahontas\\" adventure.<br /><br />It's been several months since John Smith left Jamestown and much has changed.  The goodwill generated between the English and the villagers following John Smith's departure has all but vanished.  Back in England, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) has staged an assassination attempt on John Smith, and fed the King all manner of lies relating to Jamestown's so-called \\"savages\\".  In an effort to quell the tension, John Rolfe (Billy Zane) has been dispatched to Jamestown to escort \\"Chief Pocahontas\\" back to England for an audience with the King.  When Pocahontas (Irene Bedard with singing voice once again provided by Judy Kuhn) arrives in England, it sets the stage for a dramatic reunion with John Smith but also a terrifying encounter with Ratcliffe...<br /><br />Whilst the story is fairly simplistic, POCAHONTAS II: JOURNEY TO A NEW WORLD does carry enough of the potent magic of the original film to carry it through.  There are some cute scenes with Pocahontas being schooled, \\"Pygmalion\\"-style, by John Rolfe and his dotty housekeeper Mrs Jenkins (Jean Stapleton) and some rather lovely songs (in particular Pocahontas' first number \\"Where Do I Go From Here?\\" and the haunting end credits duet \\"Between Two Worlds\\").  Who would have pegged Billy Zane as a singer?  Unfortunately Mel Gibson was unable to reprise his role of John Smith but his younger brother Donal Gibson provides a very accurate facsimile.<br /><br />Very entertaining when taken in the right spirit.
B003DZX3US|5.0|The film was great, of course, and the disc and packaging were in very good condition. If you don't already own this, you should definitely purchase it.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I thought this book would be a \\"safe\\" read since its by a bestselling author that I have read before...I was very wrong.<br />I had to give up about a quarter of the way through and that is something that I rarely do. This book was very disjointed and would jump around with facts that didnt seem to have any meaning - I definitely struggled to stay interested as I kept having to re-read paragraphs to figure out what random topic was being brought up. I was shocked at how badly it was written. I am a fan of mystery and suspense, but probably wont buy this author anymore. Life is too short for bad books!
B004SBX112|1.0|I just updated Angry Birds Seasons Free and all previous levels and years of levels are gone. WTF? This rots!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is a real 'page turner' right from the very first chapter.<br />The reader becomes enthralled by the characters and their situation.<br />You actually find yourself gasping out loud, in disbelief, at each turn of events.<br />I found the ending to be a bit 'weak' however the story more than makes up for it.<br />i really enjoyed the book and highly recommend it.

B004U8VWLE|3.0|This was not at all what I expected.  As far as psychological thrillers go I didn't feel it was one of the better ones. It did not have a lot of moments of anticipation.  I didn't see what all the fuss was about.
B006G3MZRQ|3.0|Warrior is one of the few movies I heard nothing but good things about last year. Most of the people I know with similar tastes to me praised it and put it on their 'best of 2011' lists within the top 10. This surprised me since I'm not used to sports movies getting such great feedback. Sure, I like a lot of sport movies, but I've never seen one that really made me want to go back and watch it again, let alone put it on a top 10, 25, 50 list. I recently gave Warrior a shot once it became available on a certain movie viewing service and, while it held my interest for the most part, it didn't win me over. The movie has some outstanding performances from Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte, and some fairly good fight sequences, but for me there was one big flaw, and that was one of the main characters. Warrior is still definitely worth watching- I don't even like MMA or the UFC and here I am recommending it.<br /><br />We start out with a young man, Tommy Conlon coming back to his hometown and meeting up with his dad, Paddy. This is a huge surprise to Paddy, as he hasn't seen his son in ages. A lot's happened since they last saw each other- Paddy's been sober for almost 1000 days, and now Tommy's looking to start training again. Unfortunately, Tommy lacks the decency to not drink in front of his old man, tempting him with it now and then. Even with this temptation, Paddy takes him in once again. We then meet Brendan, a high school physics teacher who's on the verge of losing his home to the bank. He refuses to file for bankruptcy and resorts to fighting in a strip club parking lot with local guys for a little extra money. Brendan's wife doesn't know about this, as he says he's just working as a bouncer. His luck gets even worse when the school finds out about his fighting, and suspends him without pay for a month. Meanwhile, Tommy becomes an instant internet sensation after a clip of him knocking out a local big shot gets uploaded. With constant training and fights, he's headed for a big event where the grand prize is five million dollars. Brendan, a former UFC competitor, also finds out about the tournament, and we soon learn that he and Tommy are brothers.<br /><br />...can you guess where this is going?<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that Warrior wasn't just some dumb fight-fight-fight movie, focusing on dudes getting beat up for 2 hours. The training sequences are well-done, and the beginning fights are over quickly, showing just how fast someone can be taken down, regardless of size or experience. Brendan's past his prime, and the guys he fights aren't exactly on the same page as him, so he's got a ways to go if he's to catch up with Tommy, a former wrestling star and Marine. Of the two characters, I wanted Brendan to win the tournament right from the get-go. He cares about his family having a good home, as well as their financial future. I cared about this character because he's just plain likable. Sure, five million bucks may be a heck of a lot more than he needs for his home situation, but hey, why NOT five million? Tommy on the other hand...well, here's the thing that got me with this movie. I read a lot of comments about both men being underdogs, and viewers not being able to figure out who they wanted to win, because both characters deserved to win. There's no doubting the latter there, but I could not stand Tommy. Arrogant, lacking respect for his father outside of using him as a coach again, not giving Brendan's family a chance when he shows Tommy pictures of his kids, there wasn't anything I liked about him except for one thing. Early on, we find out that he was a military hero, saving a group of his fellow Marines by himself, and also that his best friend was killed. Tommy is now trying to help out his friend's widow and children any way he can, and he wants to win the tournament and give them all of the money. That's a very noble thing to do, and in that sense, I couldn't help but -kind of-want him to win the tournament, but that was only if Brendan didn't come through. The family seems to be doing fine as it is: they're not in some rundown home and struggling for food or anything.<br /><br />Nick Notle does a phenomenal job as their father, never going over the top with his performance. The last thing I saw him in was Peaceful Warrior (how ironic), and I just might like his character here more but in a different way. Whenever alcohol would be near him, I'd keep thinking \\"don't do it!\\". The guy's come a long way, and had a tough time dealing with things over the years...it'd be a shame for him to throw away all that hard work. Getting chewed out by both of his boys wasn't any easier to see. A conversation between him and Tommy, where Tommy says, \\"where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened\\" was especially painful to see and hear, partially because I feel the same way about my dad.<br /><br />Even at the end of this review now, I'm debating on if I should bump the rating up to 4 stars. Warrior moves along quickly and never feels like it's 2 hours and 20 minutes. There aren't any wasted scenes or annoyingly drawn out shots, fights look very realistic, and Joel Edgerton as Brendan won me over. I just wish Tommy were more fleshed out and the plot weren't so predictable. Warrior's a great weekend choice, or just something to watch if you're sick of watching Rocky for the umpteenth time.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Cornwell is usually a good read and this book does not let the reader down. Not a cliff-hanger, but well-written and an interesting theme and topic.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Bosch is a great dark hero. Once again Michael Connolly spins a complex tale with a surprise ending. Best of all, the peripheral characters are intriguing. Great read!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show and no matter how many time I watch, it still makes me laugh. I have watched all the seasons and am looking forward to season six, which I am watching each week.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|And I loved it! The movie stayed pretty close to the same storyline, and I was happy about that. Overall, it's a great movie
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is written and acted amazingly well. It is not like any other show of this genre. Most post-apocalyptic television shows are ultimately cheesy with bad acting and unconvincing plot lines. The walking dead definitely raises the bar and this most recent season proves that there is nothing off-limits when it comes the story they are telling. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0053O89WY|5.0|It just keeps getting funnier as the seasons go on! Hope it continues to do so. The acting is first rate, and I have to say, I love<br />'Sheldon.'
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wow.. this was a stunner.  One of those books that I hated to put down. Having grown up with a dysfunctional mom, though, made many of the scenes especially difficult to get through.  In the end, I was very satisfied and loved the heroine of the story, flaws and all.

B007R3AZNK|1.0|I'm a big fan of Joe's as it relates to the great blues playing as showcased on PBS. This CD (not MP3) recording is horrible in that it is compressed, bass-shy, with an over the top sizzly top end. Actually sounds distorted on many peaks. Its not my system(s). I've tried it on three different systems and 2 pairs of headphones, including Sennheiser HD600's. Too bad, but for me, the recording quality reminds me of the first wave of cd's back in the 80's. Unlistenable. Maybe there are variations floating around. Mine is a throw-away.

B007MB5OCE|3.0|Entertaining and original.  Enjoyed the flash-backs that gave it a Forest Gump-esque quality, linking in with historical personalities and events.  Humor was dry and characters ecclectic.  Would recommend it as lighthearted, albeit unrealistic, &#34;escape&#34; reading.

B0085RQLXK|3.0|The Bad Boys from Boston yet again talked up their newest release, yep we have heard it before, wanting to get back to their rocking 70's roots, Jack Douglas back on board and the band back to their best form.<br /><br />Starting fairly dismally in my opinion nothing really grabs me until they find a groove with \\"Out Go The Lights\\" with its 70's riff and 80's rhythm and rhyming but only momentarily. I don't like chicks background singing on Aerosmith songs no matter who it is, it sort of fizzles out on the choruses, nice guitar solo by Joe Perry.<br /><br />Legendary Child I had caught an earlier live performance of this song and it rocks, I know it had been kicking around for a good mumber of years, but it's of the better rockers on this album with no real weak points like some other of the tracks.<br /><br />What Could Have Been Love is a nice ballad sung by Steven, I don't have any negatives for a track that grabbed be with a beautiful chorus. I would rank this with any of their 80's or 90's ballads, a winner in my eyes, would be a deserving hit this one.<br /><br />Sweet Jesus is more like the 70's style of playing of which there should have been alot more of, the song ain't anything special but it's played at speed propelled by great drumming and backing vocals from the band, its a great band track.<br /><br />Can't Stop Loving You dosn't belong here, should have been left for the American Idol album, it ain't Aerosmith, its Steven Tyler and Carrie Underwood.<br /><br />Lover Alot chugs along at a nice speed, the chorus is the letdown for me, its too repetative for my liking but the verses are awesome and harkens back to the good old days.<br /><br />Joe Perry takes lead vocals on Freedom Fighter, he sounds like a mix between Bob Dylan and Keith Richards, stick to the guitar mate because this song is not up to standards and just pads out the album.<br /><br />Closer adds something that no other song does on the album, a nicely constructed darker sounding song,one of the better tracks for me.<br /><br />Something is padding out the album, I just dont like the song save a few passages of nice guitar work.<br /><br />Another Last Goodbye is yet another ballad with Steven's voice centre stage, as much as I love listening to him he has done this so many times, its not a bad song though, I would have loved a nice guitar break in this song somehow.<br /><br />Too bad the album offers nothing remarkable in its home stretch, overall there were 5 or 6 songs I really dig but the rest will either grow on me or never will. Given the bands age and their recent inactivity no one was expecting an album to come close to the golden standard set in the mid 70's or even with Pump, their last great album, but when a band hypes up a release that doesn't deliver it is a little dissapointing.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book was an interesting read, but a little repetitive. Still, I decided to give wheat-free living a try. The results are pretty astounding so far. It's been less than a week and I am down more than 4 pounds, but what's more remarkable is that I have stopped feeling hungry, and have no urge to binge. I am 50 years old, and at 5.4 I weigh 161 pounds (down from almost 166 less than a week ago). The past few years I have had trouble with binge eating, especially if I drink wine. This, combined with middle age has resulted in a 30-pound weight gain. This past week I have eaten as much as I want, including eggs, meat, cheese, vegetables, some fruit (mostly berries), and lost the four pounds effortlessly. I also had a glass of red wine with dinner, and the urge to drink more and eat more, simply wasn't there.<br /><br />I am hopeful that this is the change I needed to put an end to my binge eating/drinking and get back to my ideal weight. I know it's only been a week, but I have a feeling this is really going to have a positive impact on my life.<br /><br />I will check back in periodically to update this review with my weight loss progress. My advice to you, if you are on the fence, is to give it a try. It can't hurt, and it just may help tremendously.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil begins the album sparsely on an acoustic with a \\"hey now now hey now now\\" as he drifts back to the very essence of the creation on his art whilst putting forward his views on current subjects. Crazy Horse fades in nicely over Young's acoustic intro and jam through 27 minutes of intertwining guitar interplay, harmonising and Neil's intermittant versing. This song  takes time and grows with each listen, has a soothing quality to it, one must take in the smell of the horse and enjoy the excursion.<br /><br />The title track takes its chords from Sign of Love and is fed through phasers giving it a swirling vibe. A party girl looking for a good time, its one of many songs where Neil sings of a seemingly distant unattainable mystery woman.<br /><br />Ramada Inn is where disc 1 is at, its perhaps Neil and the Horses best tune since Change Your Mind, a story song with an uplifting chorus sung by the Horse. Neil's guitar playing is a real thing of beauty, cutting and slashing weaving meandering burning yet sublimely controlled it is among my favourites that is for sure. Not on of its 17 minutes is wasted.<br /><br />Born In Ontario sees Neil kicks up the dust, it harkens back to the good days of Neil's childhood. This one would sound great on the radio and dare I say it hit worthy, Kid Rock would probably reach #1 with a similar tune.<br /><br />Disc 2 starts of with a song paying homage to the musicians that first captivated Neil as an aspiring singer. Lyrically this song is great, again, this would have easily been an early or mid 70's hit. Neil's lyrics really place you in his shoes as a young lad living and breathing the path to music stardom.<br /><br />She's Always Dancing takes me back to the 70's with its swirling and hypnotic vibe that really draws you in, in a way that Like A Huricane Did. Brilliant guitar playing from Neil, as good as on any record he has put out, it truly is, his trademark heartbreaking warble as vulnerable as ever.<br /><br />If you don't get a tear in the eye or a lump in your throat during the tender moment of the album, For the Love Of Man, this is truly a song from Neil's heart, about something real and dear to him, it moves me in a way i haven't been moved since Philedelphia. I love the way he sings the last few lines, a nod to one of his heroes Roy Orbison. Heartfelt.<br /><br />Neil snarls out the lyrics on Walk Like A Giant, in a defiant and surestrong way which aptly desribes the man who has been a giant on the music scene for over 40 years can sometimes feel like a leaf in a stream, it really is a great lyric. This song would not have been out of place on Rust Never Sleeps with Neil and Crazy Horse ending this epic tune simulating giants walking through the feedback of their guitars bass and drums.<br /><br />Perhaps unessentially the boys end the album with an alternative version of Psychadelic Pill, I am still undecided whether this version should have taken the place of track 2 and sort of spoils a fitting end to the album that Walk Like A Giant could have been. This to me is similar to the ending to the Zuma album where in my opinion Cortez The Killer should have been the final track.<br /><br />This is certainly my favourite of the Crazy Horse jamming albums, great production and plenty of trips that have been rarely bettered with the Horse.et a tear in the eye or a lump in your throat during the tender moment of the album, For the Love Of Man, this is truly a song from Neil's heart, about something real and dear to him, it moves me in a way i haven't been moved since Philedelphia.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play it on Facebook....works wonderful on my kindle.  outstanding game.  Great to pass the time or just to relax or veg.
B008EZVNO0|1.0|I have been a fan for most of my life.  I was fortunate to see Van in Las Vegas a few years ago.  Hopefully I can see Him again and enjoy some of this new music.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Great series. Great product. Great price. Mom and I spent many hours together watching Dr. Quinn on TV and this was the perfect surprise birthday gift for her! She ended up watching the whole series over again, and even my dad and little sister enjoyed it this time. Great family show, everyone gets hooked!
B008RTE09S|5.0|The remastering and the visual improvements are fantastic, I have the DVD and the blu-ray is simply a joy to watch and listen too, thumbs up!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game I love that they now have on mobile so I can play anywhere. Lots of fun and fast to play.
1449410243|4.0|In classic Oatmeal fashion, it was unique, funny, inventive, and so on with regards to other awesomeness. The only thing I didn't like we're that the huge panels, sometimes one to a page, made the book go quicker than I had expected, but it's still easily worth the money.
B00000IUKQ|5.0|I had this exact same bridge for my Brio set growing up! After visits to Grandma's house we finally decided to purchase one along with some of the Brio train sets. Our daughters face lite up the moment she opened it on her birthday and has been playing with it every since. It is very durable, and I know we will be enjoying it in our home for years to come!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is a monster of all knives. Extremely sharp out the box. After 5 sheath draws the knife became dull. Very easy to sharpen. After I resharpened it I was cleaning the blade and falet my finger twice and didn't even feel it. This knife is capable of EVERYTHING.  I've waited 3 months to get it, I'm extremely upset that I've waited that long. ONE OF THE BEST KNIVES EVER MADE...
B008XG1X18|5.0|definitely recommend to anyone that has or wishes creativity. I so glad that I found this app its a great time passer and it has some great ideas
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful, creative story. Easy to read and follow, but never boring.  Lots of good words I had to look up (with the touch of my finger on my new Kindle!!)
B007SGM084|5.0|Great story!!  Hope they make this into a movie. The story really comes to life and it was HARD to put down!
B0083GQKQG|5.0|The theme, characters and plot were done outstandingly.  The relationships were a little hard to digest and somewhat unbelievable.  Touched on topics not previously explored in films I've seen.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Having read all of the Harry Hole books it was. nice to complete the set with the very first novel to see where it all started. Good read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another engrossing novel from Ken Follett.  I have really enjoyed all his books to date-particularly the longer novels and the trilogies.  He writes with great balance of character, place and time-very enjoyable and interesting books with fabulous historical fact that has an element of learning for the reader as well as enjoyment.  I look forward to many more from him!
B00633W614|5.0|These two books, Only Time Will Tell and Sins of the Father  were just fantastic.  Loved the characters and cannot wait for the third book in the trilogy to be available. I hope it won't be too long.  Great story line which kept me reading constantly.
B007THA4FI|5.0|this is a very well written book about the human condition.  it shows that no matter your sociial status or where you live that we are intrinsically the same and bad thin ttgs and good things can change our lives equally.  I was especially taken with the portrayal of thecase worker.  as a socialogy major myself I think j.k. rawling'was spot on.  overall the very best book I'm read in a long time!
B00000JMOF|5.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this Universal horror classic...<br /><br />I find Frankenstein (1931) an all-around classic Universal horror/monster movie.  Boris Karloff was made for the role of Dr. Frankenstein's monster.  The movie as a whole has a very creepy atmosphere.  The black and white filming of the day adds to the creepy effect.  The sets, while cheap and low tech, were adequate for the 1930s.  This might be the best Frankenstein movie ever made.  I haven't seen many of them, as Frankenstein is my least favorite of the Universal monsters (Frankenstein, The Wolfman, Dracula, The Mummy).  The Wolfman is my favorite.  The acting in Frankenstein is good, especially by Karloff.  The movie is a little campy at times, but this is just how the Universal monster movies of that time period were (Dracula was somewhat campy as well, though creepy at the same time).<br /><br />If you're in the mood to watch a Universal classic, then I recommend Frankenstein.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I was hoping for more but all I could think of was Aliens for 90% of the movie. The potential for a really great movie was there but it got lost in the standard \\"nasty-alien-in-my-body\\" theme. To think the supreme race is reduced to making monsters to do their dirty work is silly. Noomi Rapace is a pleasant surprise although somewhat normalized in this Hollywood role.
B008Y1YKE4|1.0|What were they thinking? I'm not exaggerating .  A elf says to Arthur that the dog likes the slippers more than he does. The dog makes a pity face and Arthur gives him a slipper and he goes at it. What!?
B004LWZW6U|1.0|An absolute waste of time, rather stupid. The pervious Piranha movie far better in comparison. Don't buy it. Save your money guys.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book! I give 5 stars to books that I think a lot about when I'm not reading them. I was compelled to keep reading. Read the summary to see what the books about. It reminded me a bit of when I played the game Fallout 3.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Absolutely superb movie. Enjoyed it so much and have seen it the Cinema and watched on blu ray about 5 times and I will watch it again, Rihanna's performance was really good. Great special effects and sound.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|My 3 year old is enamored with garbage trucks. There is nothing in the world more awesome to my child than garbage trucks...<br />That said, this was his 3rd birthday present. We had another Bruder truck, a blue recycling truck, which he adored and thought we'd get him a different one to play with. After buying 3 Tonka garbage trucks from Target, etc., they fell apart within weeks and the blue Bruder was the only one which sustained his horsing around!<br />This is a very large and 'real' toy garbage truck. It has rubber tires, a hopper, a tailgate which opens/closes, two cans and provides about 30 min of blissful fun for him. Its been a great tool to help his dexterity improve by attaching the cans and then dumping them into the truck.<br />Every child-- boy or girl-- who comes to the house loves his garbage trucks! Every parent now asks me where to buy these! Amazon!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|An extraordinary movie and I had seen it in the theater.  The blu-ray release however, is just as sharp and the movie is just as good the second time around.  Second disc had some great outtakes, background, and etc.  I highly recommend this product.
B002MCJZHS|4.0|The problem that some might have with this band is that is subscribes to a relatively new genre of music often labeled as downbeat electronica. Reference Sirius channel \\"CHILL\\".  Some people just can't easily switch from bluegrass to metal to classical. Those of us who can, will use 'The xx' and similar music to cuddle you in the mood you're in or desire to be. The vocals here aren't massive and shouldn't be. If the musical arrangements were too challenging/complex; well, there goes the mood. I haven't see these guys live and am sort of concerned they could sustain a 2 hour show but, I did catch them on 'Later with Jools Holland' and they were magnificent.
1594203334|5.0|This book pointed out the absurdity of the typucal American parenting while showing the more balanced approached adopted by the French.  Excellent writing.  Highly recommend.
B009P13RQY|4.0|If you are a fan of The Sword buy this now! Not as good as Warp Riders but still awesome. The cover of cheap sunglasses is rad.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|So, this is the prequel to Alien... It's a BluRay... It's 3D... It's visually and audibly stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. However, I have reservations about the shallow rushed ending, the sudden athletic failure of Charlize Theron (whom as always gives a stellar performance), and the open ended themes of matriarchal society. Yes I did go there! This movie just serves to deepen the ideas of power women, broods, and the Eve vs Lilith struggle. All in all I gave this movie a 8.5/10 - Fantastic imagery, unfortunate plot holes. It's is still a must own.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|i found that this series is one of the most outstanding efforts by the actors and staff ever.. this was especally good show.. the second season is better than the first season and i am hopeing for a third..
B0088EDMMS|5.0|I purchased this BluRay to show at my Universities Halloween Movie event. I am a thirty one year old returning student and had forgotten that many of my peers were babies or (dare I say) not yet conceived when Hocus Pocus was first released. I was a little worried at first, but to my surprise many if the students seemed to enjoy the kitschy spook flick! The quality was wonderful an the sound was amazing! I highly recommend this for any BluRay collection.
B005LAII3A|2.0|Watched it part ways and I don't think I could stand much more of it.<br /><br />I approached this movie with an open mind with reasonable optimism, but 30 minutes in and I'm ready to turn it off. I'm not the kind of person that mindless say \\"oh the original is always better\\". If the remake was better, than he was better. Unfortunately, this was nowhere near the entertainment value as the first. Arnold, you've spoiled us all.
0345536886|5.0|As usual, Grisham drew me into the life of his characters.  Who among us hasn't wanted to chuck it all, sit on a bar stool for an entire day, and completely rearrange our lives thereafter.  What a terrific read!  Highly recommend.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|\\"Mark Owen\\" selflessly pays tribute to generations of Navy Seals in No Easy Day. He could have showcased his own role in the operation, and embellished his own skills; but, Owen makes his account of the mission to kill America's \\"enemy number one\\" about the sacrifice, commitment, and skill of \\"everyman\\" in the military. As a school teacher, I used this and the 60 minutes interview as companion pieces for reading \\"Beowulf.\\"
0439796644|1.0|The premise of this book was great but the story was not in depth at all. This book was suitable for a middle school student. It was very simplistic
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Ridley Scott, the original \\"Alien\\" director, and director of some of America's finest films, in my opinion, has produced a magical story for anyone who loves sweeping tales replete with mystery, suspense, shock, and heroics. The visuals are stunning, to say the least, but the visuals are just the backdrop for a brilliantly realized story about a group of people who find themselves traveling together in a massive spaceship, paid for by a now-dead multibillionaire who left a recorded a message for the varied team of experts.<br />From the grave, the elderly \\"captain of industry\\" explains that two of the passengers on the deep-space flight might have found the \\"fathers\\" of mankind - god-like creatures who visited Earth millions of years ago, and who left cryptic drawings in caves and on the walls of underground passages all 'round the world, drawings that seem to point the way for humanity to find them on an as-yet unexplored planet.<br />Of course, each of the characters in this ensemble cast has his/her own agenda, which often conflicts with the others' dreams of glory.<br />Once the team lands on the rugged, uninhabited planet, each new discovery brings inherent dangers to the whole crew.<br />Acting is superb. Cinematography is eye-popping! Imaginations run wild, and nothing is as it seems.<br />A worthwhile, satisfying film experience.
1582701709|5.0|It should not be a secret what is in this book. This is a great book that is a must read and re read!  I look at things so much more differently now.  I recommend this for all to read

B002M2T1UO|3.0|This is on of the best series that was on tv at the time and set the standard for cop shows. The reason I gave this set three stars was because of the transfer quality is very poor! They are grainy to the point that words are hard to read on a HD tv and the audio takes a while to start. Its still a favorite and a good collection just wished for better quality.

B003LAH7MU|1.0|I can sum it up this way - the first time I heard this, I was (vocally) appalled that someone was making Muzak out of old Police songs, when the woman in the music section of the Barnes and Noble corrected me and told me that it was an official release by Sting.  To make a long story short, eventually five people were standing around talking about the sheer scope of the travesty.  The Barnes and Noble person confessed to having been told to play it, and she couldn't wait until it was over.  I have since heard parts of it on another occasion, and my opinion hasn't changed. Putrid.
B009346RSS|1.0|Soooo happy to report that this converter works perfect for my needs!  I was a little concerned since packaging included instructions and little neon-colored notes... I was hoping to just plug&play.  Thankfully it was!  Neon notes said to be sure to choose PCM for audio source, which meant nothing to me.  I flipped thru my LG tv onscreen menus, found no references to PCM, so just went for it.  I took little caps off the connector points, matched cords to where they go...and wala!  I bought BlueRigger cable b/c reviews made it sound like buying a little more expensive cable would be worth it..and these two products worked great together.<br /><br />Only comment is that I didn't realize this converter needs to be plugged into a regular outlet, so I wish I had bought a longer (6ft) BlueRigger cable.  As it is I have cables/cords all pulled taut between the tv and outlets.  But not a big deal...just need to rearrange living room furniture...later.<br /><br />BTW I needed to convert \\"optical digital audio out\\" to regular red/white plug-in cord to connect a bluetooth device for some wireless headphones..and it worked great.  I barely missed ANY of the beginnings of our family movie before I had it all up&running.  Yeah!!!<br /><br />*UPDATE... well, don't know why but this only worked first few times.  Then could never get it working again.  Returned this item.  :(

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked this show and as I work in a book store I HAD to see it to compare it with the book story. I think the movie helps the warmth of the books fundamental characters but dosen't do justice to the gritty quality of life Katniss and friends were forced to endure. The lesser characters of the book aren't as prominent in the movie. IMHO the three books in this series do a much better job coloring stories (with characters) in that way. The movie does a good job at reloading your anxiety over governmental controls when applied to society as a whole. I watched this on Amazon Instant Video on a PC.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I considered this book a classic read.  Having been written over 100 years ago you have to expect it to be different to books we read that have been written recently.  I enjoyed reading the book but did find it to be a little tedious and far fetched in places. However, I am glad I have read it. Stevenson writes well and I would certainly like to read other books he has written.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|Anne Neville (1456-1485) is not well-known as a personality in her own right. She is most famous for being the wronged wife of Richard III (1452-1485). At the time of her death, many whispered that she'd been poisoned by her husband to make way for his marriage to his niece Elizabeth of York (1466-1503). That marriage never happened, because Richard was obliged to deny before parliament that he'd had a relationship with Elizabeth. Shortly, thereafter on August 22, Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field.<br /><br />Anne is also known as the daughter of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (1429-1471), aka \\"Warwick the Kingmaker\\" for his making and unmaking of England's kings during the Wars of the Roses. And lastly, she is known for being the wife of Edward, Prince of Wales (1453-1471), the son and heir of Henry VI and Marguerite d'Anjou. They married in 1470, when Anne was only 14. Edward was killed at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, leaving Anne a widow at the age of 15.<br /><br />So it was a pleasure to read Philippa Gregory's account of her in THE KINGMAKER'S DAUGHTER, in which Anne is the protagonist. In Ms. Gregory's account, Anne emerges as an endearing and intelligent heroine, caught up in the snares of her father's politics during as he swings from one side to another. Originally promised to Richard of Gloucester, a younger brother of the Yorkist King Edward IV, Anne is married off to Edward, Prince of Wales of the House of Lancaster. When Edward regains his throne and the House of Lancaster is crushed, Anne (according to Ms. Gregory) chooses to marry Richard of Gloucester as her second husband. Thus her marriage to the man who later becomes King Richard III, starts out as a love match.<br /><br />Ms. Gregory keeps very close to her characters in her stories, and I think this is what makes them so popular. In this novel, you feel as if you are actually with Anne as the events of her life unfold. The author has also done a superlative job with Anne's voice. Anne is not a charismatic person like Elizabeth Woodville or Jacquetta de St. Pol. Her voice does not have the bite of a Margaret Beaufort. Nevertheless, her quiet determination shines in this novel. Five stars.'s voice. Anne is not a charismatic person like Elizabeth Woodville or Jacquetta de St. Pol. Her voice does not have the bite of a Margaret Beaufort.

B0033806MI|5.0|Really good and the stories are great. Percy Jackson is my fish books to read. Go Percy Jackson. See Ya later
B005NACYQU|4.0|For breadth of imagination Neil Gaiman can't be faulted and this work is no different. I kept wondering what would come next, and I certainly didn't see Low-Key (Loki)coming, even though I kept expecting that he and Thor would pop up at some time. I found the book difficult to put down, even though there were some places where the action dragged somewhat. The work compares quite favourably with that of Roger Zelazny, whom I think was the undisputed master of this sub-genre.<br /><br />Sam
B0042JSSVI|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't leave it down. It's very well written and it told the story of Pompei in an accessible and interesting way.
B007G92QGO|4.0|This is a fascinating read- a &#34;can't put it down&#34; book.  I do not read crime stories , but this was on  my book club list so with some trepidation I began to read.<br />I sat  for some seven hours, becoming stiff in my joints in the process, until I read the final outcome in the last pages.<br />Then I had so much food for thought. How did I react emotionally to family crises in the past and why was this similar or different from those of the book's characters?<br />Excellent for book club discussion for those who have reared chlldren.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|A thought provoking book , illumaniting and moving.<br />One of the books that you still think about weeks after finishing it.
B002S0KB1S|4.0|great read and Ozzy is entertaining and does not make excuses for some of his mistakes and faux pas's.<br />Laugh out load at times and tearful at others.
B004SBX112|1.0|The update I received today just knocked Angry Birds Seasons back to the St Patrick's day update. The only levels available are Halloween, Valentines, Christmas, and St Patricks. All progress is gone.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I like the movie, is not the best movie out there but it is good. Yes I would watch it again.
B008FDP7AW|2.0|I give this one extra star, bumping it to 2 stars, since it's the great Skynyrd. The song samples for this sound excellent, but the mp3 download is priced at $10.99. It is also priced high on other sites I have checked. On Amazon, it is priced from $2 to $3 higher than most other downloads. Stop being greedy, Skynyrd and Roadrunner Records. Then, maybe more fans like me will purchase downloads like this.
0684847817|5.0|I love Brian Froud's art, combined with his descriptions of various kinds of fairies.  He has done several books on various topics, and this flip book gives some great contrasts.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I just downloaded this TURKEY. I don't know exactly what it's supposed to do because it just sits there when I press the OPEN button. When I click on the icon on the carousel, it takes me back to the dowload page and Office Suite Pro dosen't even recognize that it exists. I wish I could give it zero stars.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive but I personally think it needs more levels. This is a six word sentence.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I was very happy with the item and how well it was wrapped up and boxed. It arrived to me very quickly before the due date.I was very impressed.
0679805273|5.0|Will ask my sons teachers to write a message for him in this book. I absolutely love this story even as an adult! It has a great message!
B008AT9XOC|1.0|Frank Oz, in the extras on this DVD, explains that the Director's Cut with it's radically different ending depicts the original version of the film, true to the original screenplay and duplicating the endings of the first film and the play.  I'm happy that there is an explanation for this and I respect that the film-makers are trying to honor the original vision.  That being said, I absolutely hated it.  Having watched it, I no longer know what the film is supposed to be about.  Where in the first version we saw a very sweet 'against-the-odds' love story and good triumphing over evil, this version blows that out of the water.  If there is now a moral to this story, I'd love to know what it is.  I'm selling my copy on eBay and going back to the 1986 version.  Takers?
0525952926|5.0|quality pages, printed  as the first book of the series, cant wait to continue the trilogy read!..will take it's place on the bookshelf with all my other Ken Follett books...awesome storyteller!  .
B009VB97EY|4.0|I honestly think that this was such a fun movie to watch!!! Who doesn't love Channing Tatum and his sexy charming self? He is such a talented actor and is truly beautiful to watch!!! That being said, the story line is a bit PG in terms of portraying the world of strippers (male or female)....as much as I appreciate the entertainment value of this film, I often found myself questioning the depiction of \\"a mere means to earn a living\\" message that it sent.  I felt that it made light of the reality lived by people who take their clothes off for a living in order to entertain others.  I do understand that it is a movie and does help one to escape from their own reality (as most movies do!!!), but, my fear is that glorifying this world might deter some individuals from pursuing a field that will sustain their success in life beyond their perceived \\"hot\\" years.  LOL in any event..cheers, blessings and success to all!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The characters in this book were so warped and dysfunctional making it such an entertaining read the entire book.I read it so fast I wanted to read it again.It makes you wonder if the author is writing about herself or someone very close to her.Once again,the twist of events will leave you wanting to read another book by Gillian Flynn.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is great. i love the show so i thought what the heck. i bought the book and i loved it. if u like the show(p.s. season 3 episode 5 comes out tonight!!!!!!) then buy this.

B009VB97EY|5.0|It may not have been the best movie, however the men could have just stood in front of the camera and made farting noises in their elbow and I would nominate them for an Oscar! Man, they are all a bunch of hotties and boy can Channing move! 5 stars from me! :)
B000FC13Y0|5.0|You can count on Neil Gaiman for a strange and satisfying story. This is no exception. I cried a few times while reading this, and the ending was glorious. Highly recomended.
B0083UWX04|3.0|This is a DVD re-master of (I guess) an old video tape recording. While it is good for perhaps nostalgic reasons or for archiving the fine performance of the very talented Ms. Argerich, this product is basically un-watchable and un-listenable. The video is poor quality, for example, Ms. Argerich's hand movements are so much blurred that one can't recognize which notes she was playing. The audio reminds me of old cassette tapes of classical music with limited bandwidth, audio noise and poor dynamic range. I can't recommend this product.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game was downloaded with high hopes.  I just couldn't understand it!  Plus, you really can't do much with this free game unless you start spending money to actually play it.  I deleted it off my device.
B003O2RQKI|4.0|I agree with one reviewer that the sound quality of this DVD, though very good, is a little limited in dynamic range. While the high notes are clear, the low notes are a little lacking in comparison with modern-day CD or DVD-Audio recordings, which are able to capture the dynamics of pianos that the listener can \\"feel\\". But all this comment about the audio quality should not (cannot) overshadow an excellent live performance by Lang Lang; particularly the Appassionata sonata, in which Lang Lang's artistry reminds me of great recordings by Gilels and Pollini. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Although I didn't dislike the book, it would certainly rank towards the bottom as far as my favorites of Grisham's. It just never seemed to go anywhere.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|The Exorcist was amazing even without the deleted scenes.  But if it's one of your favorites, the director's cut is a must see.  Loved it!
1416594795|5.0|Richard Dawkins' book \\"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution\\" is a thorough treatment of evolution for the casual reader.  The book traces out the various scientific arguments in favor of evolution, roughly corresponding to the following:<br /><br />1. Evolution's support as a theory (in the same way that gravity is a theory) in the scientific community<br />2. The existence of unnatural selection such as domestication and breeding of livestock<br />3. How natural selection is an extension of unnatural selection<br />4. Various geological dating techniques confirm the age of fossils<br />5. Observable evolution of organisms such as bacteria<br />6. The fossil record gives evidence of many transitional species<br />7. Likewise, the fossil record includes mankind's early descendants<br />8. Evidence from embryology<br />9. Evidence from islands and plate tectonics<br />10. Evidence from the similar features of evolutionary \\"cousins\\"<br />11. Evidence from genetics<br />12. Reasons that creationism is extremely unlikely<br /><br />This list does not exhaust the arguments that Dawkins makes, but rather gives an idea of what this book is about. He writes clearly and at an understandable level for non-scientists.  Every idea is explained clearly using relatable examples and a clear explanation of difficult science.  Many of the ideas in this book are complicated and it is to Dawkins' credit that he is able to convey his ideas so well.<br /><br />Many people will dislike this book for a number of reasons. For some it is that it conflicts with their beliefs, some will be put-off by Dawkins' uncompromising tone, and others just won't enjoy the topic.  If you think you fall into one of these categories, then you probably won't like this book and can without shame avoid reading it.  If on the other hand, you are curious about evolution, interested in challenging your biases and beliefs, and want to read something both challenging and increasingly relevant fortoday's world, I recommend this book without reservation.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Although Grisham most always provides a good read I was some what disapointed in The Racketeer. It seemed to me to lack any degree of realism which I had come to expect of Grisham. The ending was pretty well telegraphed so it was no surprise. Some entertainment value but not one of my favorites.
B0063FQLTK|5.0|If you like zaz than you'll like zaz live. There's a couple of new song that aren't on her other album. So I feel like that's a good score for me. This really is a fantastic addition to any collection of music.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Ok just not really my cup of tea.  Good if you like scifi kind of things.  Glad I did not spend a lot of money on this book.  Way  different from other crouch novels.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Page turner. I am very add and a book has to be simply amazing for me to finish. I cannot wait to see what happens next!!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|No problems at all on my Toshiba Thrive.  Lots of Star War sounds and visuals.  Give it a try!  Hope they have the issues worked out for those that were having problems.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Not a bad but movie it seemed like it just went on and on. I started to wonder if the movie had an end to it.
1118232658|5.0|My girlfriend gifted me the second edition of Erik Qualman's Socialnomics and it turned out to be a fantastic read! Social media and the economics related to it radically shifts the metrics of how we define success in marketing. Old world KPIs cease to exist and markters and brand managers need to adapt to the new ones. Erik Qualman illustrates this radical shift using practical examples and combining it with wit and analogy that keeps you bound throughout the read. Whether you are a practitioner, student of marketing or even a social media adversary (You will know what I mean when you read it!) Socialnomics is great value for money. Congrats to Erik and cant wait for more such pathbreaking ideas!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Great show, keeps you guessing and pulled into the story. Originally bought the series at the wife's request and found myself watching it as well.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Always enjoy reading John Grisham's books and this one did not disappoint.  Had to read it right away as soon as it was downloaded to my kindle.

B0084RSYEK|5.0|Eddie Murphy has done it again. Found this movie to be very funny. Great for an evening at home with the family.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this CD it was great! The piano guys are awesome. I will be buying more. Great way to introduce classic music to everyone.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love Jonny Lee Miller and have since Hackers. He was great in the film adaptation of Manafield Park too. Lucy Liu has been great since Ally McBeal and Charlie's Angels. Love this show!
B0086DBE62|2.0|This was like watching Julia Roberts' romantic comedy persona filling in for Angelica Huston.  The tone of the movie was equally as confused.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the second book and this last one in two weeks while working full time and not forgetting my family. It was a great end to the trilogy. I don't want to ruin the story, but Ms. Collins did a great job of keeping you captivated and interested in the story. Great attention to detail and great transitions from chapter to chapter. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Thank you Kristen Stewart for ruining another movie.<br /><br />There really isn't a plot line, the love story sucks, Kristen Stewart can't act, and basically this is just not a good movie. Save your money for something better.
0525953728|5.0|From what I've read since the raid, I am glad he stepped into the dangerous spotlight to take the beating the media and govt would give him. I believe him. He is honest, and not seeking fame or sensationalism. Thank you to him, I pray for his safety at this point.
B007REV4T8|1.0|I love Daniel Craig and James Bond. My favorite James Bond movie is Tomorrow Never Dies. But I hate movies like Skyfall where the villain is just out to get the good guys for a past grievance. It is just like all those Batman, Spiderman, and Superman movies where the bad guy is just out to get the superhero. So in a way the superhero is the one who brings the trouble.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|At $3.99 for the entire album, this is a steal.  It's not possible to listen to this album and remain completely still.  Well done Maroon 5 !
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! its so fun I cant stop playing I play for hours. its a really addicting game.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it needs more time and it is hard to control so it isn't that fun but I still like and I am not convinced to buy the full version
B009HV2JT8|4.0|...a surprisingly entertaining, and unexpectedly good movie. The premise seemed to promise a high cheese factor. However, as the movie progressed, I found myself sucked into the story line, the characters, the well-written dialog, the accompanying soundtrack and stunning cinematography.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Be sure to read Cloud Atlas before you attend the excellent new movie in order to follow the story lines, and understand critical information about each character's motivation.
B004UID2LC|5.0|love it so much better then going online me and my friends love it so so much can't get over it
B0089BSM70|4.0|The continuation of the night Michael Myers escaped. They never show this one at Halloween. It's a must own for Horry movie collectors and Myers fans everywhere!

0345803485|1.0|I had to see what all the hub-bub was about.  So I put the book on hold at my library.  After a three month wait it shows up at my door.  To set the stage of my reading life, let me say I read romance novels a lot.  I also red thrillers and murder mysteries, legal and medical thrillers, sci-fi, and basically no classical novels unless I feel I have to.  I read for pure pleasure and escape.  I am one of the \\"housewives\\" who this was aimed at.<br /><br />While reading this book, which took me over a week by the way, I was just scratching my head the whole way through wondering how in the world this book got to be so popular.  I'm not into all that bondage junk but I was willing to give it a try since this book is so popular.  Again, all that hub-bub had me wondering.  Well the fact that it took me a whole week to read is telling in itself.  If I am reading a GOOD BOOK I can read it in 2 days.  If it's really good I can read it in a night.  I enjoy reading so much that I have been known to read till 4AM because the book is just too good to put down even though I've got to go to work the next day.<br /><br />The popularity of this basically SUCK-E book has lead me to be even more of the feeling that most adults today are childish.  I agree whole-heartedly with other reviewers who have joked about Ana's constant JEEZ, Lip-biting, orgasms every second, and Christians billionaire status, adonis body, pilot status, and on and on.  It does sound like it was written by two teenagers dreaming of the perfect man.<br /><br />I just can't figure how the heck this got so popular.  But then again I'm not with the majority of people in my thoughts.  I voted for the other guy and am completely dissatisfied with the state of our country, economy, and on and on.  So to get away from REAL LIFE I like to read silly romance novels.  But this doesn't even pique my interest beyond the first book and I feel I've wasted my time reading it.
B008O037RG|5.0|this album is perfectly awesome! i can listen to it 100 times and never get sick of it! Honestly the best band out there! They can pull of things most people cannot! I am truely amazed!  you would have to be crazy not to get it! The lyrics to the songs are just so powerful!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|When I first saw the preview, I was intrigued. DNA manipulation and ever present thirst for why we are here, drives the movie's undertone. But then things go terribly wrong. Not to reveal to much, but the writers did a great job of connecting to the franchise.
B008BM9L72|2.0|I began to read the triology of Fifty Shades of Grey and the first book was very good but after beginning to read the second, it became rather boring and by the end of the third book I found it BORING.  The repetition of the sex acts etc were not entertaining and the story became rather dull.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Since I didn't &#34;discover&#34; Castle until the fifth season, I had to put up with watching the earlier seasons in reruns to catch up. By the time it was approaching the end of the second season reruns, I was a real fan and getting this, the fourth season, was a no brainer.<br /><br />Third season was about to start in rerun but the fourth season was a long way off and getting this set allowed me to catch up much more quickly. It's a great season with lots of high quality mystery drama and that comedic touch that Castle and the rest of the cast are so good at. Really lovin' this set.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, a few twists and turns. I cannot rave about this story, but it was a quick and enjoyable read.  When reading Grisham these days I find myself mentally casting the movie and visualizing as though it were already on the screen.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|There are preciously few bad Depp films (save the hokey Pirates of the Caribbean sequels) and The Rum Diary is no exception - it's another neat little romp with Depp's offbeat trademark.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gets into quirky roles better than most actors, and in this, he plays an idealistic journalist in Puerto Rico.  In this brave new world, Depp's character Paul Kemp has to navigate Cold War and US imperialist tendencies of the time while maintaining his sense of moral integrity.<br /><br />The Rum Diary is enjoyable because you can feel the passion everyone had in making the film.  Set in the 1960s, it has an otherworldly, nostalgic setting that's rare in today's cinema.  It feels like a tribute in some ways to world cinema of that era and the good ol' days of being American.  It's like watching a Graham Greene or Hemingway-esque novel spiked with rum.  I think the people who don't enjoy it just don't get what the film is supposed to be about - and it's hardly complicated.<br /><br />Rum Diary also has shades of a Coen Brothers film but is far more down to earth.  The cast is brilliant - Aaron Eckhart; Amber Heard (you can practically see Depp falling in love with her onscreen); the seedy Giovanni Ribisi and the hapless Michael Rispoli - all make for an interesting and enjoyable lot of misfits.
B005OLUOVA|5.0|I can't add anything new to the review, but I just want to say how much I love this boxset. I'm a big Rammstein fan, and the box is worth every penny. The best of cd is great to listen to when you just want the hits, like when you ride in the car. I like techno music, so the remix cd sounds cool. I'm German, so I recognize some of the remix bands. Scooter's remix of Pussy is my favorite.<br />But the main reason I brought the box are the dvds. Every music video of Rammstein is like a mini movie. And to have all of their videos together is just great.<br />I also love looking at the picture book. It's a great visual that shows their artistic stages up to today.<br />So, if you a Rammstein fan, you will love this box.
B009SSGBOE|4.0|Donald Fagen is the master at jazzy pop and deep thought provoking lyrics. This solo effort does not disappoint. The musicianship is predictably flawless and on point. Although Fagens voice is clearly showing it's age, he can still croon his own brand of jazzy blues at the highest level.
B008VBYN80|4.0|this game is really good but I thinks it takes a long time for the energy to reload.  it has a great storyline and is a great idea.  I would definetley recommend it to my rriends
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I was sad to not have this movie on dvd and catch it around Halloween. I only use netflix and don't have cable. I was pleased to find the amazon instant video app on my 360 and rent this high quality movie. The rental was for 48 hours starting only when I began streaming my movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book but didn't like the ending.  A lot of build up and then a tremendous let down.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good game when you just have a few minutes to kill. Very easy to learn and play, but not particularly challenging.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a must read for every woman....just when you think one thing is going to happen, something else better does!
B008XG1X18|5.0|an endless idea generator and an excellent resource for just about anything.  also a great way to lose all track of time!
B007NZDES0|5.0|When I saw the concert in Atlantic City I was in awe!  That was the perfect venue to see Sade. The sound system was incredible, her stage theatrics were on point and it made the show even more exciting.  I am so glad to have it on dvd and to have seen it in person.  It might be another 7-10 years before she does another concert in the states.
B009DALSSG|5.0|A great little Xbox/pc controller. Possibly the best controller for its price.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Pricing; a great value for the quality<br />* Fits great in my hands<br />* The triggers are much better than the official controller; they curve out at the end, good finger positioning and no slip.<br />* Analog sticks have 16 bit resolution (2x the norm!) resulting in better accuracy, most usefull in driving and FPS games<br />* Has a \\"trip cord;\\" if someone trips on the cord, it disconnects the wire instead of ripping off the USB port on your console/pc<br />* Standard Xbox input (Xinput), works with any game that supports the Xbox controller<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Burnout Paradise didn't recognize the controller as an Xbox controller, I had to configure it manually (other games worked right off the bat)<br />* It only has a single pin connector, many controller accessories aren't compatible<br />* The extra resistance on the triggers might tire your fingers in long sessions (Well worth the added precision)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great to pass the time away once you get high enough in levels you can play for along time.  it is great to have when you waiting on a appointment
B0096HIEE2|4.0|Fun the first time I watched it, don't expect a complex storyline. Second time I watched it found myself fast forwarding to all the dance scenes. Definitely a girls night movie, fun and silly.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Funny older folks. Good plot line. The visual aspect of India was enthralling. Loved getting a glimpse into that culture.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|I found myself gripped to the story and sadness, also some sweet lighthearted parts. Know many people who didn't care for this movie but I enjoyed watching it, but it will not be a movie I will buy and re-watch again.

B0011Z5IUK|5.0|Great purchase. This is one of Led Zeppelin's best cd's. A great cd no matter what rock bands you like, you can listen to this.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I saw the original movie a long time ago, so it was refreshing to finally see what happened to them in later years.
B005LAJ212|4.0|A woman seeks answers to the question, who killed her father and why. Not content with just the answers, she is determined to make those responsible pay and feel the pain. For each there is a special revenge. Gripping and twisting and turning from the first episode, a must see.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Although the entrance of the movie was a little confusing. Although several questions were answered, by the end there were several more created. Such as, if the \\"Aliens\\" were on the Earth and giving reason to create the \\"maps\\" why would they point to a planet that was an armory?  In the end the movie was outstanding leaving room to answer more questions and probably ask more.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I never get bored with this game! the next level is always just a little more difficult than the last.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Glad I got it in time for Halloween! gonna be a regular part of My festivities for a long time.
B0011E7JBW|1.0|DVD was listed as \\"like new\\" but had a crack at the center, which rendered it useless for playing.  Buyer beware and buy new - then you at least know what you are getting.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Challenging puzzles, creative storyline and lovely graphics. I was sad to see this game come to an end. Ready for part 2!
B009AMANBA|5.0|Limited release?  WHY?  I've been anxiously waiting for this movie, and now I find out that it will only be shown in \\"limited\\" cities - which Never means Peoria, Illinois. We've been through this too often before.<br /><br />This is SO maddening. Why can't we have access to some of the good movies that others get to see? The silly crap is always shown in Peoria, which I wouldn't waste my time or money on. Why are good movies limited? Is Peoria really that much of a backwater area?
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Hey Amazon, we kindle fire (hd) users are still waiting for the free version. Thanks. hopefully it will be out tomorrow. it's still a good game, though. i will rate this 5 stars when it's free on kindle fire (hd).<br /><br />William.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another home run for the greatest fiction author of our times. Grisham never disappoints the reader and takes us on a journey full of twists and turns.
1400069289|2.0|Most of this book is filler and is very irritating to sit through. I have the audio version of this book and it was still a struggle to get through this book.<br />Not recommended.
B00846REIS|3.0|But the writing wasn't all that great. I liked the Fifty shades series better, even though the writing wasn't the greatest there either. I read both of the books, but probably won't read the next one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The imagination behind these books really is amazing! I read and read just to get more details about this futuristic world. The plot and characters keep you on edge. A really fun and interesting read!!!! I recommend it to everyone.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad Piggies is a nice entertaining physics based game with works perfectly on Kindle Fire. The game play is engaging and graphics and physics are superb. This game deserves full five stars as it makes you think and construct contraptions to clear a level.<br /><br />It is surely better than Angry birds and the reviewers here on Amazon are always the best resource one can have. Also thank you Rovio Entertainment Ltd and Amazon for making this excellent game free on the Amazon Kindle devices.<br /><br />Cheers!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I've never been more than a casual Testament fan, but this album is some of the best metal I have ever heard. The tight, monstrous guitar riffs and fantastic drumming are a level above anything else out there save a select few (who I won't mention since this is a Testament review after all). My personal standout is the sublime cover of Iron Maiden's Powerslave. The job Testament did with this song is nothing short of mind-blowing - the absolutely epic guitar solo in particular is spectacular. It is thematically perfect and close to note-for-note with the original with some extra technical wizardry that only adds to the exquisite composition of Iron Maiden's master work. The sound on the whole album is uniformly excellent and the guitar and bass tones are to die for. The vocal style is perfect for this type of music - I get tired of metal acts with vocalists who sound like they ought to be singing \\"Moon River. HIGHLY recommended for any fan of metal, classic or contemporary.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|There is an Angry birds version of every conceivable theme and each time a new version comes out everyone including me jumps into the bandwagon and give the game a try.<br /><br />I must admit, There is something magical about Angry Birds. While the goal is simple it draws everyone's attention to play the game. The main reason is the cuteness of the game and Angry Birds Star wars edition is no exception. The rendering of the characters are very good and so are the physics of the game. The graphics and sound effects are excellent and game-play is enjoying just like the previous editions.<br /><br />The Star wars theme brings some new characters and powers, The background with dual suns and nice funny sound effects does make this game just as enjoyable. It does get difficult to play as the game progresses but nothing that is impossible to achieve. There are bonus rounds and more the stars you collect better are the chances of getting bonus rounds.<br /><br />I am however disappointed seeing that the free version is not made compatible with Kindle Fire, It worked fine on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 but if I were to play this game officially on Kindles I have to pay $2.99 which I find little too steep. I am sure in days to come there will be a version of Angry Birds that will be free and playable on Kindle Fire.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and would enjoy watching it again.<br />I don't understand the commitment to \\"the Mission\\" at the expense of everything else. I don't understand the \\"brotherhood\\" among the Seals. It's a different world from the one I inhabit and I doubt I could give myself to it. But in times of war it is necessary and that is what came home to me while watching this film. We are at war and these men are out there on the front lines sacrificing to keep us safe.<br />How many attacks have been thwarted, how many lives and property have been saved from destruction by the unheralded front lines that defend our way of life? Well, unheralded until how. My hat's off to the men and makers of this film.
B00913DPW2|4.0|[[ASIN:B00913DPW2 The Haunt]] was attempted on Kindle Fire and I must say \\"I am amazed\\" by the intricate details on every screen and the sheer amount of work the developer has done to design the game. The presentation is superb and while it is another find the hidden object type of game the theme and the puzzles makes this game stand out from others. I had purchased [[ASIN:B0073LWEXK The Lost City]] and [[ASIN:B004FOA84A The Secret of Grisly Manor]] and enjoyed the games. The haunt has the workings to scare people but to me seemed just little too spooky at times.<br /><br />The puzzles are little hard to solve and the lack of zoom to take a closer look at the object is a serious drawback to the game. But with little perseverance and thinking you can surely solve the puzzles. There are many sites that offer you a visual walk-through including YouTube if you are stuck at any level.<br /><br />Overall a creepy enjoyable game (If you like those sorts of games)<br /><br />Have fun!
B0088W2LC2|5.0|Amazon finally updated every episode to be available in HD! I had seen several  complaints about missing HD episodes in these comments but I guess nobody reported it.  Was fixed shortly after I reported it!
B006ZT47O0|5.0|I've been listening to RFTI for a while now and I have to say that, while my first impression of the album was not the best, after about a week or so it really did start to grow on me. I think a lot of the other reviewers here probably never got over their same initial reactions as well, and that's a terrible shame because once you get past the adjustment period, RFTI is actually probably Epica's best album to date.<br /><br />The thing you have to understand about RFTI, and probably its biggest hurdle with the audience, is that it is Epica's first album without a catchy, conventional single to help ease listeners into the album. There's no \\"Unleashed,\\" there's no \\"Cry for the Moon\\", there's no \\"Never Enough\\". The single they threw at us was \\"Storm the Sorrow\\", which was probably picked because it was the most \\"conventional,\\" i.e. lacking in Mark's death growls. This should give you a pretty good idea of how steep of a curve the rest of the album is. I have a feeling that at this particular point in their careers, the folks in Epica had figured that they no longer need the hand-holding of catchy, poppy singles to help sell to their fans, and that they were going to do their own thing and we were just going to have to deal with it.<br /><br />What eventually broke through for me after about a day or two was \\"Monopoly on Truth.\\" It had a bit of everything--soaring highs, pounding lows, and layers upon layers of melodic complexity. \\"Serenade of Self-Destruction\\" came next for me for much of the same reasons. Both of these songs brought me back to the musical ideas of \\"Consigned to Oblivion,\\" where there's this big epic score broken up into a couple of movements with all these different elements coming together in a strangely jarring but ultimately cohesive musical narrative. Then the \\"Single-act\\" tracks followed shortly--\\"Deter the Tyrant\\" and \\"Avalanche\\" for me were the other big standouts, although none of the tracks on the album could be described as actually bad. Icould put this album on repeat by itself and leave it on all day without getting tired of it, which I can only say for a few other albums.<br /><br />I feel like what RFTI did (and did exceedingly well) was completely break from the medieval tropes of symphonic metal set in stone since the days of \\"Angels Fall First\\". RFTI is not bright and flowery, it is sparse in uplifting major chords, and it is not ornate with symphonic frills or attempts at operatics. It is dramatic, not in the way that a passion play or a love story about vampires and elves is dramatic, but in the way that a populist revolution or a hurricane is dramatic. It is dark, bleak, aggressive, and completely lacking in harpsichords. If you're mainly a fan of the old-school power-metal style of symphonic metal typical of Nightwish, Within Temptation, or the first couple of Epica albums even, you might be severely disappointed by RFTI. But if you're like me and have grown tired of the umpteenth symphonic metal release that does nothing but incrementally retread the same ground paved by Nightwish over a decade ago, this just might be the refreshing change of pace you were looking for.<br /><br />(Oh and one final thing--are people STILL complaining about Mark's vocals? It's been ten years for god's sake, and there's not been a single Epica album that doesn't feature Mark's vocals.  Moreover, death growls are basically bog standard in the metal genre, and complaining about it is like...complaining about alcohol in scotch whisky. Are you sure you're a drinker if this is such a big hangup for you?)
B009VB97EY|1.0|I should be paid to have watched this movie!  It's mindless, tasteless, I can go on. If I could rate it a 0 I would.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft but I don't have the money to buy it. Why can't you put the demo version for kindle also instead of just Ipad, Ipod, and others. This should be the app of the day sometime.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|The app is a pretty good Bible app.  I would have given it at least 4 stars, but I was following the pastor's reading and kept getting lost.  Later, comparing it to a paper Bible, I found that some verses were missing or truncated.  This was the NKJ version, and I did find missing words in one other version (don't remember which one).

0062073567|5.0|So, I recently read Agatha Christie's The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd. If you haven't read it, you should really read it. It is pretty amazing. I was a little put off by the way that the narrator only has a personality that's filled in with very broad strokes. I'm used to detective novels where the narrator has a ness-ness-an essence-that permeates the whole book. In this one the main character, the doctor in a little village in the English countryside, doesn't really put a strong stamp on the novel. And Hercule Poirot, the detective, also doesn't really feel like he leaps off the page (although he is amusing). The most vivid characters (as in the average episode of Law and Order) are the side-characters. The doctor's gossipy sister is a real prize, I loved her. But also the various people around the manner are interesting, albeit archetypical.<br /><br />The real joy of the book is the plotting, though. This book has some of the meticulous plotting I've ever seen. It's like a machine. Once, I heard a writer talk about how the beginning of a novel should be filled with the people and complications that are going to propel the rest of the novel forward.<br /><br />Agatha Christie definitely follows this advice. She doesn't raise just one conundrum, she raises fifteen. How did this guy get murdered if the door was locked? Who murdered him if everyone has an alibi? Who was blackmailing his girlfriend? Who was his son talking to in the forest? Who does this mysterious wedding ring belong to? What's up with the anonymous phone call that alerted the doctor to his death? Who was the man who the doctor met as he was leaving the manor? The mysteries just pile higher and higher into this massive tottering edifice.<br /><br />And they don't get resolved one by one, either. Each time one mystery is answered, it adds two more. And with every suspect who gets eliminated, there's that much more pressure on each of the others. By the end, you feel like anyone can be the murderer. It was fantastic. I've never read anything like it.  And I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I think this is a perfect example of why all books don't necessarily need to have all things. The fact that this book had less of the typical joys of the detective novel (setting and personality) allowed me to enjoy its superlative plotting. In this case, I wouldn't say that it's thinness is at all a flaw. In fact, considering all the juggling that Christie is doing, I wonder if it would've even worked at all if the novel had been more filled with voice and details. I suspect that it would've failed.<br /><br />Crossposted from my blog: blotter-paper.coms fantastic. I've never read anything like it.

B005HSL626|4.0|I went to play it today and a message popped up stating I had to redownload it from the app store... I hope this works. I really love this game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has great graphics and good story line. The only complaint I have is the lack of a map. It would be helpful to keep track of where you have been and where you need to go to complete assigned tasks. Despite lacking a map I really enjoyed this game.
B009HEIHZA|1.0|I thought the movie wasn't too bad but I really would like to know when I'm buying edited content. Next time I'll read more reviews before I purchase.

B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book about an older man's sudden and seemingly absurd quest to walk from the very south of England to the Scottish border to see an ailing friend, is not only very readable but also gives us a serious reminder about what we take for granted in our own lives, and shouldn't.  As he walks, Harold begins to reflect on his life and the decisions and actions he took - or didn't take - and how they have affected the rest of his life.  He doesn't know, however, that his wife, so suddenly deserted thanks to his spur of the moment decision, is also reviewing their life together.  She also has to come to terms with some of her own past judgements and begins to see them from a different perspective. There are many secondary characters in the book, who all play their little part in what amounts to Harold's re-education on life, and the whole is glued together by a strength of character that Harold had no idea he possessed. What appeared to be a nice gentle read is actually much more thought-provoking than I expected.  Perhaps a little bitty in places but altogether charming and worthy.
B0092G1O8A|2.0|I choose this rating cause the movie stopped in the middle of playing.  Changed to another DVD movie still stopped at that point.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great app to play Spider Solitare on! It's fun, and easy to learn! I like how you can change the background. I used to play Spider on my computer- and now I can play on my Kindle Fire, too! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys solitare.

B0087UN94E|4.0|This is classic Neil Young, following his muse and not worrying so much what the marketplace thinks. It often sounds a like jam session, but in a good way. The record is worth it for This Land is Your Land and Clementine alone, and the medley of God Save the Queen and My County Tis of Thee is a great piece of art and political statement.
0307951529|5.0|If you are thinking of starting a company....this is a must read. I love the concept of doing what you love and turning it into a business.

B000059T1V|5.0|It's hard to believe the man commanding the stage in this concert is the same shy kid in Alan Lomax's Stovall recordings. This is a genius at his fiery best, tearing it up with his guitar, voice and dance moves. Buy the record and check out the videos on youtube. He was amazing.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|The eugenecists who terraformed &#34;Miranda&#34; had an early start - in actual, factual American history and this story/film shows that no matter how sophisticated we become technologically - we are still each of us collectivist despots, which explains how, despite all our technological advances, we end up under tyranny time and again and why we also therefore find ourselves in RESISTANCE against the power-mad again and again.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Its a shame this is not the collectors edition with all of the extras, but if you are a fan of the movie and just HAVE to have it in 3D then this is a great buy. If you already have it in bluray and dont care much about owning it in 3D then dont bother, there is nothing extra here.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved this movie. The A-list cast delivers an outstanding performance. Add to that a great story about the importance of living every day and seeing the beautiful things that surround us. Definitely worth watching.

B000025802|3.0|I had LPs of sympnonies #8 and #9 from this set in the old days, and when I saw the complete set available, I decided to investigate the rest of them.  Unfortunately, I think 8 and 9 happened to be the high mark of the set.  #6, and to a less degree, #7 are rather disappointing. Try Neumann and Czech orchestra, a much better choice IMO.  Having said that, the set is still decent value, and #8 and 9 will keep a good memory of Kubelik alive.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|I loved every song on the soundtrack.  If you love the show \\"Austin & Ally\\", then I would suggest to get this soundtrack.
B008RTE08E|5.0|Maybe at the time it was released, it could have (and was) perceived as being amateurist....time has been generous. The Beatles were arguably at their satorial peak, young, together, and a glimpse in the eye of the hurricane prior to the rot setting in. The music is still great and while we'll never confuse this romp with HDN, it's withstood the test of time and remains relevant.
1449410243|5.0|Very humorous. I was debating if I should buy the comics or not at first but am very happy I did. The extra comics were enjoyable and very creative<br /><br />Whether you own a cat or don't own, you will enjoy it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great read.  It is very hard book to put down.  You just have to know what Mal/Max is up to.  John manages to keep you captivated, while reeling a tale of a corrupt system and a clever way to beat it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A wonderful, infuriating presentation of the way deregulation of the financial institutions initiated by Ronald Reagan in 1981 and escalated through the years by subsequent presidents and their administrations to the present caused among other things, the worldwide disastrous theft of billions in 2008 and the financial crisis that continues to have its tsunami effect.<br /><br />The movie shows through interviews of some of the goons that are still walking free, living high off the money they stole from their own companies, people's retirement funds and other investors who ignorantly trusted their `expert' advice. In the interviews one can see many of the culprits attempting to justify, dismiss and try to convince others of their innocence in bankrupting their own companies and their continued unethical behavior.<br /><br />The movie also shows interviews with many ethical political figures who explain clearly the conscious, purposeful, deceptive, unethical business practices that were allowed under deregulation and how the men have still been allowed to walk free with the money they stole from investors, employee retirement funds and illegal government bailouts.<br /><br />The movie also includes great visuals that clearly explain how this was done and how the theft of billions was allowed worldwide by too many unethical government officials, financial advisers, business owners and includes professors from many of the so called `elite' universities in the US. Teachers who when interviewed clearly demonstrate they have no problem in teaching one how to be a sociopath.<br /><br />It is a great valid demonstration that `letting the market regulate itself' does not work!!!! Too many of these men are happily ok with deceiving and cheating on their wives and families, how possibly could one expect them to behave any different in business, government etc.?<br /><br />I am going to continue to support actions that have the stolen money confiscated from all the thieves andreturned to their rightful owners including US taxpayers!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham continues to excel at weaving a tale that is realistic, interesting, and new. I love the law, and his books combine the human side and the prvisions of federal and state statutes in a way no one else can. Can't wait for his next work.

1400069289|5.0|I got a lot of information from this book, it's sort of tucked away and given in bits and pieces. Revealing insights into who we are and how we go about living our lives. I enjoyed the small stories that went along with how the brain works. The science on how the human brain works is a new frontier, this is a very good book in that it decribes the how and why we do what we do and how habit forms, becoiming part of our lives. It also does some explaining on the way to change your habits and how to create new habits. I found this book to be interesting and informative.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Being the year of the 50th anniversary of the beloved super spy, the 23rd Bond installment had a lot to live up to. While Casino Royale was a worthy and thrilling reboot to the franchise, Quantum of Solace fell flat with critics and fans. To make matters more interesting, MGM has had financial woes over the last number of years and needed a hit to reinvigorate the studio. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Skyfall.<br /><br />Not only does the movie qualify as one of the most action-packed and entertaining movies of the year, it ranks on my list as one of the best Bond flicks to date. As has come to be expected, Craig is terrific as the British spy, portraying the character with charm and intensity. The action is top notch and the story is superbly written. Among my favorite moments were the blistering opening sequences, the introduction of the film's villain, and the intense final act, which finds Bond cornered yet unafraid. The real treat, however, is Bardem's role as the sinister Silva. Rivaling any villain in recent memory, save Heath Ledger's Joker, Bardem is intimidating, powerful, and irresistible to watch. You'll find yourself glued to the screen whenever he appears, and hoping he'll show up again soon when he's gone.<br /><br />Another huge nod has to go to Mendes, whose vision of Bond is spectacular. The movie is tightly scripted and the director does a very fine job of bringing out great performances from his cast. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in a film for a long time; the production crew did a remarkable job utilizing light, colors, and atmosphere to really draw the audience in. Another treat is the glimpse the audiences gets into Bond's past, which plays a crucial role in the film.<br /><br />The transfer to Blu-ray is beautiful; the colors are pin-sharp and the picture is clear, crisp, and detailed. In a film that contains such vibrant colors and contrasts, this was immensely important for home release. All of the great cinematographic moments you saw in the theater look just as great here. The audio is equally perfect. The disc's DTS-HD MA 5.1 track contain all the intensity and clarity contained in the theatrical release so you can enjoy the crashes, explosions, gun shots, and dialogue in high definition.<br /><br />By way of special features, there's just under an hour of behind-the-scenes featurettes that are an interesting watch, as well as the original action-heavy trailer for the movie, \\"Skyfall Premiere\\" feature, and two different audio commentaries; a detailed and information-rich feature from Mendes and a not-so-interesting one from producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and production designer Dennis Gassner. The insight from Mendes is fascinating and any fan of the film will be sure to enjoy it. The commentary from the producers felt more like a promotion of the film and could have been left off the disc in my opinion.<br /><br />Whether your a die-hard Bond fan or a casual observer, Skyfall has something for everyone. There are multiple references to past Bond adventures, yet enough new and innovative ideas to please newcomers to the franchise. I highly recommend this film. This BD set doesn't boast hours and hours of extra footage but it has enough to please fans that are curious about the making of the film. Overall a terrific movie, beautiful disc transfer, and engaging Blu-ray set.ic moments you saw in the theater look just as great here. The audio is equally perfect.

B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book. I was looking for a book that was as gripping as 50 Shades, this was actually better. I did not care so much for the next two books, but this one was great.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|Pitch Perfect works for a number of reasons, The biggest, and most entertaining reason, is definitely Rebel Wilson, who's performance is hilarious and hopefully leads to more starring roles in the future. The other greatest reasons for the movie's success is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. There are multiple scenes in which characters melodramatically complain about the hardships and high-stress involved in the uber-competitive competition that is a cappella singing. Kendrick, as we've come to expect, owns this role and is a joy when she's on screen. If you're a fan of singing shows such as Glee, Smash, or Nashville, you'll definitely enjoy Pitch Perfect.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Yes another fast moving Jack Reacher novelmwithba few unexpected twists. Not one of his best journeys, but good overall. Good book for a flight or two.
1608871517|4.0|This book isn't about Michael's music...or about his personal life. It's mostly about his performances and the costumes that helped make Michael magic. It's written by a man who was Michael's dresser and costume designer from the \\"Bad\\" era right through the end...in fact, Michael Bush (author) is the man who selected and dressed Michael in the outfit he was buried in (yes there is information about that outfit in this book).<br /><br />What I loved about this was the insight you get into Michael's life. Bush knew him and knew him well. The tidbits you learn about  Michael's personality and his performaces are amazing and fun. There's nothing negative in this book...it's all about how Michael helped people stretch themselves and challenge themselves.<br /><br />It's powerful and the pictures are amazingly detailed. When Bush tells the story about a costume, there's a picture of it. He goes into some of the most well known items (the glove, the \\"beat it\\" jacket, the shoes) as well as what Michael prefered for every day wear.<br /><br />For a fan, this book is gold. My only complaints are that occassionally the author repeats himself and there are too many autographed photos of Bush and Michael together in this book. But these are small complaints to a wonderful book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second novel answers a lot of the questions created by the first, be sure to have the third book at hand and ready to read. These books are hot, a little twisted, and a good cure for a rainy night in.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an excellent read.  I recommended it to friends and family.  You will like it if you want the truth.
044024630X|3.0|\\"Mississippi hooligans are made of sterner stuff than most. Or else they're just plain dumber.\\" - Reacher, after a one-sided fight<br /><br />\\"I picked a road at random, and I put one foot on the curb and one in the traffic lane, and I stuck out my thumb.\\" - Reacher, on the first act of the rest of his life (and series)<br /><br />At this stage in the review accumulation for THE AFFAIR, I doubt that there's much I can add to the previous 474 posts. So, I'll be briefer than usual.<br /><br />For perhaps the first third of this thriller, I thought it might prove to be the best in the series. Then, I became disenchanted.<br /><br />True, author Lee Child tosses out enough red meat to at least partially satisfy the fans' hunger for physical mayhem inflicted and investigatory smarts demonstrated by his Military Police hero, Jack Reacher. But, still...<br /><br />The thing is, Child had the clear opportunity to pit Jack against perhaps his most clever and capable adversary yet and provide a plot twist that would have snapped his most jaded reader's head around in a neck-wrenching jerk. He toyed with the concept but ultimately didn't follow through. Rather, the ending unfolded with almost a yawn.<br /><br />Lee joins a couple other authors of fiction that I've noticed who've chosen to include in the plot an intriguing secondary character that deserves books of her own. I say \\"her\\" because in all instances they're women: First Sergeant Frances Neagley in several Reacher installments, Charlie Button in Stephen Leather's Spider Shepherd series, and someone named \\"Cora\\" briefly on-stage in Gerard Cappa's [[ASIN:B008AUYZXK Blood from a Shadow]].<br /><br />THE AFFAIR is a solid but not scintillating read which, if nothing else, gives fans an insight on the background to Jack's first thumb-out on his continuing road tour as a knight errant.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|One of the first apps I put on my Fire HD.  Works great!<br /><br />Like the display options and data on hours left or hours to recharge.  Makes life with the Fire easier.  I use it many times every day.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I don't typically watch any gory or scary movies, yet Walking Dead is both -- and it's the best show currently on TV. Not too happy when they kill off actors, but the new actors keep the show fresh.<br /><br />Since I gave up cable TV recently, I'm very happy I can buy Walking Dead from Amazon!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Was instantly addicted.  Very frustrating until you play awhile.  Worth price.  Will buy other quell games...very interesting.  Wish it had more variety of sounds..not same one over and over.
B008I2OAEE|2.0|This band was once one of my favorites but that was a<br />long time ago.I loved Mandylion, still do. I like<br />Nightime Birds and How to Measure a Planet. Too bad<br />everything after that went downhill. Home has to be<br />one of the worst albums ever. I sort of liked West Pole<br />because of the new singer. This new release is not the<br />direction I had hoped for. I don't want to hear them<br />experiment with synthesizers. I think the titles,<br />Heroes for Ghosts and I Can See Four Miles try to<br />take a free ride on better bands. I wont be surprised<br />if this ends American listeners interest. I know it<br />has ended mine. The Gathering R.I.P.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another book that is what we've come to expect from Grisham.  I didn't want to put it down.  It's not his absolute  best work in terms of building suspense, so I couldn't give it five stars, but it was entirely enjoyable.  I'd have given it 4.5 stars if that was an option.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Author has continued adding features to a very good alarm application. Now the application is more than an alarm, having a timer.
B00004WPFX|3.0|While this is one of the greatest house/electronic albums to have been released in the 90s, this latest vinyl pressing from Virgin may be problematic. I purchased this vinyl from my local record store last night, and when I first opened it and looked at the vinyl under light it looked a little warped, seeing grooves going across other grooves at parts throughout (on both sides of the A/B side). Then when I played it, there were constant bumps and pops and skips throughout every song. I didn't bother listening to the C/D vinyl, and promptly returned it.<br /><br />When I talked to the employee at the record store, they said they had had the same problem with other people buying the same album. I have a feeling there may have been a large number of defective pressings.<br /><br />Try to get an earlier pressing of this album, or be lucky and buy this one and get a pressing that isn't screwy.<br /><br />Amazing album though.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|DC animation has nailed it again! If you are a batman fan, you will love this. If you just like a good story and know a little about Batman, you will also really enjoy this.<br /><br />Quick overview:<br /><br />Set in the future, an aging Batman comes out of retirement. He's still built like a linebacker and hits like a truck, but his body (and mind) constantly remind him that he's no longer in his prime. This is a dark and angry Batman. He's almost unbalanced mentally. He is still sharp, don't get me wrong, but... well you just need to watch it :).
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|For Christians, this parable of FAITH is a movie I return to every Christmas.  The Conductor, representing pastors and all who would offer an invitation to receive Christ, along with the boy struggling to beleive, is reminiscent of my early days as a Christian.  All this adds to the Polar Express's journey to the &#34;Celestial City.&#34;  In 3D you are transported to the center of the action and people of faith will not be dissapointed.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This movie is just great fun. It's one of those films that retains it's magic on every viewing. I have yet to meet anyone who does not love this movie after they've seen it.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|I watch this program regularly.......I like it so much, I want to keep it.<br />So I purchase all the DVD's as soon as they are available
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Anyone who loves Ridley Scott's work should enjoy this.  Especially if you are a fan of the Alien movies.  Prometheus, is a real thriller. The first time I watched it, I was very excited, the second time it actually scared me.  A wonderful movie.
0316227706|5.0|I ordered this book as a gift for my mother. I thumbed through it and it made me burst out laughing. Its cute and hilarious photos are a must have for any coffee table. Order it, you won't be dissapointed.

B007FROGME|4.0|Very well written and certainly built the tension.  Loved the main characters and all their flaws. Admired how they overcame their inherent fears.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|I agree with TCORLANDO, except that I'm afraid he gives the songs too much credit. How excited I was for months prior to the release...and the anticipation only grew each time it was postponed. If it was postponed THAT many times, it MUST mean the Fnal result would most certainly be even better, right? WRONG. I was crushed. I never thought I'd see the day when  Aerosmith  was out rocked by the new KISS album. Sad days indeed.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Why wouldn't you love this guy. He Literally comes with no baggage. Do love his version of justice and revenge.
B0058YPL66|5.0|My granddaughter's husband had not seen this first season when he started watching the second season on TV. So I got it for him for his birthday.  He absolutely loved it.  Great product.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It's a great bag. All of my Nikon D90 stuff fits in well. I wish it were a little bigger and lose the Amazon zippers.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|Aliens from the beginning, this movie has more of the true spark of the first movie. A little gritty and plenty of suspense. A great Sci-fi thriller with plenty of room to expand towards the original movie.
B0001WE6U2|4.0|This shade fits my 18-105 Nikkor lens perfectly. It can go on forwards and backwards and there are no artifacts to be seen at any range. Do not buy the less expensive &#34;universal&#34; hoods for your lens.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|A very great visual flim, but a very rushed movie. It holds you with the setup ,but you getting the feeling you seen this played out before.But you except something even more visual, better idea. This movie has got nearly 20 plus years on capable advancements over the movie Aliens.Aliens makes this movie look like a joke. There was so much more that this movie could have been. I do recommend watching this movie but dont get your pocket itching for 3 buck instant stream. A dollar rental will make you feel better after watching it.
030758836X|3.0|I finally read this book because of all the wonderful reviews. It was a good story but for some reason it didn't feel 5 star to me. The ending left me hanging a little and it wasn't a good feeling. Not sure how this author managed to do this. First I started out liking both Nick and Amy. Then I started disliking Nick, then I started disliking Amy and by the end of the book I wasn't too thrilled with either of them. It left a bad taste at the end. I didn't have anyone to cheer for. I guess you could call it a book with anti-heroes.
034580404X|5.0|Well...I dont usually read books like this but with all the controversy I had to try! I am glad I did! Book 1 set the stage for an AMAZING love story! I found myself throughly engulfed in Ana and Christian's world. I found myself falling for Christian and feeling his pain like Ana! This took me by surprise. Once I was done with the book I didn't realize why people complained about the sexual parts! I have to say I didn't want book three to end. I loved how the author went back to the very beginning from Christian's point of view....I would read them all over again from his perspective! Anyway, I loved the books, loved the characters.....sad that I am done now! If you can get past the first one the other two make it all worth it!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|can get somewhat addictive at first.  its a good game. but time becomes a factor and can get boring after a while.
030771652X|4.0|I almost put this book down since it seemed like a typical \\"I miss my dead sister\\" book, but it evolves into an entirely different book during the last quarter. It reminds me of \\"Gone Girl\\" in the sense that I almost gave up on that book, too, but was very glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />It was wonderful and I hope to read more from this gifted author in the future.<br />Well done
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game itself is a lot of fun, which is why I even bothered to give it an extra star. However I've had so many problems with this game crashing my kindle that it's just not worth the bother. I've also had to reinstall the game twice because certain elements of the game were not working properly. Recently I've had to restart my kindle at least three times during one gaming session because that's the only remedy to the game freezing my kindle. Extremely frustrated and disappointed.
B00846REIS|4.0|great book will re ad again. I loved all the sex, in the limo and all the other places,it was ok

B008AU7F3C|5.0|I was trying to think of words to sum up this album but I can only think of images. The Haunted Man is a field of flowers, a nebulous sky, a deep dark sea, a forest at dusk - it's a phantasmagoric dream. Natasha envokes darkness and purity like nothing I've heard before, I simply need her music in my life... and you will too. Hard to imagine how it can be her best yet, as she is always exquisite, but I am amazed by this.

B004S699LI|1.0|I've been replacing my DVD library with bluray version. Throughout the process I have gotten blurays that simply couldn't convince me to give up my DVD version. This is one of those.<br /><br />Don't bother getting From Dusk Til Dawn on bluray, not even for $7. It has no special features or extra content. None what so ever. Aspect ration is incorrect (cropped).<br /><br />Seriously, what is the point of releasing an old movie in bluray format if it is not going to give you a better experience than DVD version!?
B008NA3I30|2.0|Compared to \\"Away From Her\\", \\"Take This Waltz\\" is a major dissapointment. I had to force myself to watch this film through the first hour. After that, inertia, only, held me to the end. I felt no chemistry between the two \\"lovers\\". If you look slightly below the surface, you see three people in need of therapy: the wife, who  married too young, the husband, so focussed on career, he hardly sees his wife, and the \\"artist\\" across the street with nothing going on in the world, except his obsession for a married woman.<br />There are two truth-tellers in the film: the Sarah Silverman character and one of the older, nameless women in the shower scene (\\"Even new turns old\\").<br />The \\"Making of\\" featurette was charming, because everyone associated with the movie is charming. Even the featurette, however, became too long: too much footage of Sarah Polly waxing philosophical about what the film was trying to say (but did not say clearly enough).<br />The photography is marvelous. I particularly enjoyed the beginning sequence showing Ms. Williams baking muffins. She is charming in her appearance and in her movements. Maybe this should have been a silent movie.<br />With such a talented, charming cast, perhaps Ms. Polly should have developed characters and story with the cast members, as Mike Leigh does. I think the end product would have been more satisfying.

B005L12SB2|5.0|I finally purchased this box set after considering it for a long time.  I have many of the Kansas Albums on Vinyl. I must say that the remastering is excellent. Many remasters subject the listener to way to much sub bass...although this can be equalized out ...it still tends to muddy up the Bass guitar and bring the Bass Drum forward...that being said... these cds sound great. For the price...very cool. The box for this set is not great...the packaging is better than Jewel cases and the booklet basic.  I do see at least 3 diff individuals involved in the re mastering of the cds.  Overall a great purchase for any Kansas or prog rock fan.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love Nelson Demille. I love John Corey. I did love this book, simply because of the aforementioned pieces in place.<br />But. It was just boring.

B009GENZKS|4.0|Let me confess and say that I have never played any of the Resident Evil games.  But, I have watched all of the live-action Resident Evil movies.  And, I am a fan of the movie franchise!  So, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is.<br /><br />The story follows U.S. agent Leon Kennedy as he makes his way through the war-torn parts of the former Soviet Union.  For many years after the break up of the state, rebels have been waging war against the government in order to gain their independence.  At one point, a truce was agreed on, but the discovery of valuable natural resources within the territory occupied by the rebels brought back conflict.  The government is now reluctant to allow the rebels to carve out their own territory.  Not now that oil has been discovered there!  Meanwhile, the current head of the government, Svetlana Belikova, has worked out a way to get rid of the rebels once and for all.  As Leon carries out his independent investigation (the U.S. government has called back its agents), he meets  up with two members of the rebel group.  Sasha and JD are both leaders within the rebel army.<br /><br />And it would not be a Resident Evil movie without those menacing \\"Bio-Hazards\\", right?  Don't you worry.  There's plenty here.  It seems both sides are using them as weapons.  Using the Plaga organism, both sides can now control the bioweapons.  A method has been found to control the bio-weapons because there are subordinate types and dominant types of this parasite.  Basically, the same principle that works in the relationship between a queen bee and her worker bees.  Using the same principle, engineered at the genetic level, the government has found a way to control the bio-weapons by infecting them with the Plaga parasite.  Eager to use this technology against the government, Sasha steals a sample of the parasite.  Sasha injects himself with the mutation agent so that he can transform into the equivalent of the \\"queen bee\\", or what is known as the \\"Dominant Plaga\\".<br /><br />Sasha and Leon infiltrate the Presidential palace.  With the help of an old friend (Ada Wong), Leon makes his way down to the underground research facility.  Sasha brings along his bioweapons, overpowers the government soldiers and leads a raid on the research facility.  President Svetlana, who is also underground, waits until the rebels are all underground.  And then she initiates a lock-down, trapping the rebels underground.  But, not before she releases two of the most fearsome creatures ever to appear in the Resident Evil franchise!  Sasha's bio-weapons (the lickers, basically) are no match for the government's latest bio-engineered weapons.  Basically, these new government weapons are a highly-advanced, re-engineered  versions of the Tyrant T-103.<br /><br />This is a very, very good movie.  Those bio-engineered weapons are the scariest, baddest adversaries ever to appear in the franchise.  The voice-acting is nothing short of superb.  Veteran voice actors such as Dave Wittenberg, Michael McConnohie, Wendee Lee, and Michael Mercer play the parts of the main characters.  You may recognize some of these voice actors.  They have appeared in many of Namco-Bandai's video games.  Dave Wittenberg, for example, played Allen Ridgeley in the Xenosaga franchise.  And Michael McConnohie played Commander Margulis in the same franchise.  I highly recommend this movie.  And those bio-engineered weapons will really put chills in your spine!  The movie does a very good job of bringing the game's survival-horror atmosphere to the movie audience.s the \\"Dominant Plaga\\".<br /><br />Sasha and Leon infiltrate the Presidential palace.

B0064BWDRW|5.0|I am a fan of Harry Hole and couldn't wait for this book.  And it was worth it.  I found it tightly written.  It grabbed me from the first sentence and never let me go until the breathless ending, which took me by complete surprise.  I loved the way the story was written in first and third person narrative.  Quite unusual - but it worked brilliantly in this novel. To say more would be a spoiler.  I look forward to the next Jo Nesbo book.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Survivalcraft is only a demo. I was finished building my house and I was about to put in the furniture when it popped up saying PAY FOR THE FULL VERSION. Also, it doesn't let you put anything else down. When you have four things already, it doesn't let you get anything else. But it was fun! It has more stuff than Minecraft Pocket Edition.

159420411X|5.0|As someone who has heard of, but has never studied, Baye's Theorem, I thought this was a great introduction to it. I'm currently in a Statistics class, and this book is a great companion to the course text. It describes some of the concepts and warnings (such as correlation does not imply causation) in much more interesting (and detailed) contexts than our textbook. This book has inspired me to continue studying statistic, probability, and other mathematical subjects.

I tried it again before I started to write this review emotions played with!! The game loaded but when I picked My minions it froze. In the end I am NOT happy with this game!

B0000009SE|1.0|I have never been able to understand the popularity of this album. It's at least twice as long as the material can justify, and the solos are mediocre at best. I think it's the only Zappa album that is literally forgettable. While there are a couple of memorable themes amid the interminable soloing, those themes were developed far more memorably, years later, in later live performances that are far more interesting to listen to.
0345803485|2.0|I thought I really must read this after all the fuss, but really?! It's repetitive and mostly quite badly written. The sex scenes tend to try to be shocking but the use of language ie 'Down there' etc comes over as almost juvenile. There are far better books out there in this genre.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|I arrived in Barcelona yesterday on a long lost Bucket List quest and within an hour was staring at a poster plastered on a lamppost inviting me to be astonished that Madam \\"Some Body's Sins, But not Mine\\" was going to be performing a little thing called \\"Banga' in the art form itself venue of Palau de La Musica on November 19-the day before I leave Spain. Serendipity prevailed and I got to the theater within an hour to snag the final seat before sell-out.  Went back to the apartment that I'm cribbed in and downloaded the \\"Banga\\" album and have been sailing on the crest of recollections of Patti Smith riding the white Horse of my own futile hunger to be artistically relevant in the 70somethings. Every song on this collection is wisdom and outrage reconciled.  I'm working hard to digest and fall in futile love with every cut ahead of the concert on the 19th.  Anyone out there who can't come to Barcelona by the 19th, please buy the album and drive your life through the rear-view mirror until you reach ice station contentment. I can't believe I'll hear her sing `em live in less than a week.  Get this album, read the menu and weep.  Shanti, Lucky 1.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is similar to many Bejeweled like games out there where you shift tiles around, but it has a lot of original twists and variations that make it a fun challenge that requires thought. My favorite Bejeweled like game yet.

B002RXVOX0|5.0|With all due apologies to the original film with Bela Lugosi, this is much more watchable. The action and dialog are nearly identical, but thank goodness for modern special effects. I own the original and it gets watched, but I'm so glad this one came to my attention!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I enjoed playing coin dozed on my kindle fire very much.I would recommend geting it and playing it to every one.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent movie. The acting was great and although the story line was a bit predictable, the writing and dialogue brought it all together. Would definitely recommend.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|This cooler was great for about 28 days and now the fan rattles once the cpu temps go up and it is driving me insane. I will never recommend another CoolerMaster product as this is unacceptable.<br /><br />Temps stay low until I play games but once I start a game then the noise starts. Unable to stand it for any length period of time.

B008476HBM|5.0|A must read. Sometimes the greatest loves begin when and were we least expect it. Jane Austen, one of my favorite writers,surely ahead of her time!!!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|The first thing I noticed about Skyfall was the vast amount of talent involved. With apologies to Sean Connery, Daniel Craig gives the best acting performances of any Bond. It's not that he's a better actor than Connery, but he's asked to play the role with a lot more realism, and that works well for me.<br /><br />Other actors of note are even better than Craig: Judi Dench is wonderful as M, Javier Bardem is over the top and hilarious as Silva, and Ralph Fiennes appears as Gareth Mallory. It's rare that Oscar winners and nominees have so many key roles in an action movie.<br /><br />In addition to the acting talent, Sam Mendes (American Beauty) directs, Thomas Newman (10 Oscar nominations) is responsible for the score, and Roger Deakins (9 Oscar nominations) does his usual excellent job with the cinematography.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Quantum of Solace, it was definitely flawed. It was too short, so everything felt rushed. It was also rather unbalanced, with five major chase scenes in the first 30 minutes, and an abundance of quick cuts and shaky-cam. Skyfall has a couple of major chase scenes, but the action never eclipses the overall story.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple. A computer hard drive has been stolen, and it contains the identities and missions of MI6 agents. M's computer is hacked and she is informed that the identities of five agents will be released each week. It becomes clear that the knowledge originated from MI6, or from someone with intimate knowledge of the organization.<br /><br />Bond is injured and believed to be dead after an accident early in the movie, but he turns up alive when he feels that his services are needed. However, he's clearly not completely healthy. Is he fit for duty? Is age catching up with him? Would it be dangerous to allow him to resume duty while he is recovering? I like that Bond is portrayed as vulnerable. He can be hurt, and he can make mistakes.<br /><br />Craig's Bond is a different beast from any that have come before. He's colder and tougher, and the campy humor is gone. That's not to say that the humor is completely absent, it's just smarter and funnier. Many of the best lines are possible because of the relationship between Bond and M. Check out the word association scene for an example.<br /><br />Most of the expected elements are present. The movie visits China, Turkey, England and Scotland. There's obviously a new Bond girl, but she's in fewer scenes than you might expect. The music, action sequences and humor all add to the familiar feel. There's even a few references to previous Bond movies, and fans will love the inspired inclusion of an old piece of machinery.<br /><br />The movie also continues to establish characters that we have come to know and love from previous entries in the franchise, but I'll let you make those discoveries for yourself.<br /><br />After 23 movies and 50 years, the Bond franchise is alive and well. Many critics are suggesting that Skyfall is the best Bond movie to date. They may be right, but I can't decide between Skyfall and Casino Royale. Skyfall wouldn't work as well without the relationships and story arc established in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. The three Craig movies don't quite have the depth of the Bourne movies, but the gap is miniscule.<br /><br />Skyfall will appeal to fans of Bond, spy movies, and action movies. I only hope that Craig's next two appearances as Bond are up to this standard.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5come before. He's colder and tougher, and the campy humor is gone.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander's experiences are truly remarkable, and say something important about the nature of spirituality, but not what he thinks they say. I am skeptical about this being proof that consciousness transcends the brain. I think it is more likely that it is proof that consciousness does not depend on higher brain function, that organized images and thinking can go on at subcortical levels, and that the lesson is that to be spiritually enlightened involves integrating many levels of brain and mind function.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a wonderful and thought-provoking book.

B008220C92|4.0|This film is a watered down version of the hand held camera genre. In instances where they didn't use home video footage, they filmed the scene bad enough to make it feel like found footage. The movie opens showing us a family being hung in their back yard. True crime author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) moves into the same house with the intention of investigating the gruesome killing and writing about it. The locals are not warm to the idea, but we don't see any incidences due to budget constraints. Ellison doesn't inform his family they are in the same house that the killings took place.<br /><br />In the attic, Ellison discovers a horde of super 8 movies (some that have their own sound track, or so it seems) of the killing he is investigating as well as other killings that date back to the 1960's. He asks the questions, \\"Who is filming this?\\" and \\"Why?\\" and \\"Where is Stephanie?\\" She was the daughter of the family that was hung. They never found her.<br /><br />Ellison begins to investigate the other cases as weird things start to happen in the home. As usual it starts out slow and escalates.<br /><br />I liked the concept of the film more than its amateurish execution. Ellison drinks rather heavily which makes for an alternate explanation of his \\"hallucinations.\\" The film would have been better if it had lead us in that direction, rather than just discuss it. Those who enjoy the \\"Paranormal\\" type movies should find a friend in this film. I loved the film in the beginning, but then it slowly wanes. Thumb rule: When you think demons are in your house, turn on the lights.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex. or nudity. Snuff films. 3 1/2 stars. Should scare the kids during a sleepover at Trent Raznor's house.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|You will not be disappointed in this series. The second season is a real mind blower, had me on the edge of my seat at every moment.
B009AMALGM|2.0|Unless you have the IQ of a turnip, you already know this series is fake. However, the producers in their wisdom have decided if they can cut off more heads with bad camera angles and implore worse sound they might still convince us of the reality of this film. If you go on U-Tube or watch the amateur submissions to some America's video TV show, you will see that we are better photographers than this series makes us out to be.<br /><br />In the beginning, Hunter is kidnapped as an infant. We then jump to 5 years later. The film starts out mostly of a young male filming a teen female (Kathryn Newton). She has a younger brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). When Robbie (Brady Allen)the creepy young boy next door shows up with his imaginary friend weird things begin to happen. Alex, our teen girl allows the young man (Matt Shively) to set up cameras around the house to film the weird things that are going on and to cut off everyone's head. While weird things were caught on camera, they never went back to view the films which was the whole purpose of setting up the cameras in the first place.<br /><br />Special effects, and by by &quot;special&quot; I mean ride the short bus special, included the chandelier moving, doors opening, chairs moving, covers coming off, and a bad levitation scene. No pool crawler getting out of the pool by itself.<br /><br />This was by far the least of the series. If you were a big fan of the other three, you might find enjoyment in this one as this is upgraded to color. These films are cheap to make and pay for themselves in the opening weekend. Don't expect the franchise to go away anytime soon. Kathryn Newton did a good job in spite of the script and horrible camera shooting.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, C-blocking. No sex or nudity.

B007KOYEOC|5.0|This third book made it all make sense. In the first book i didn't think much of Grey, but in this third book it seemed to all fall into place, such a different read and what an imagination the author has.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My family and friends are so happy that I use this app. I have been trying out some of the food recipes and they are loving it. So many interesting links.  Always finding new things to try.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|After all the media hype about these books I just had to read them, well wow! I couldn't stop reading and then I had to download the next two of the trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great, fast read that keeps you guessing and hoping. Can't wait to continue to the next one.  I highly recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first installment and immediately bought the Omnibus edition as I really enjoyed the characters and story line.  The book is a great commentary on the stratification and manipulation of human society whether present or in a futuristic world. The characters and their world are all believable and the author does a great job in balancing the story line and describing the details of their futuristic world.  I look forward to more stories in this series.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|It was ok, but again not worth the $. I would wait for free prime or Netflix.<br />I have to have a minimum number of words - wow!
B0009U5DD0|5.0|The Best of the Gypsy Kings.  OK, it's great.  They have popularized gypsy flamenco without watering it down.  As expected from the sons and nephews of Manitas de Plata.  If you like Flamenco or Spanish Guitar, you should love it.  They know the musical genre, they are virtuosi on the guitar, and the sound is great.  Unfortunately, I have to close my eyes to see Carmen Amaya dancing, but she would have recognized their music straight away and danced her heart out to it (as she always did).  Recommended with enthusiasm!
1451650728|5.0|David Mack's, Star Trek: Cold Equations: Persistence of Vision Part I, takes us on a journey of Dr. Noonian Soong's creation of Data.  It turns out that Dr. Soong is still alive.  The only change was that he placed his consciousness and the body of an android.  If you saw the Next Generation episode, \\"Brothers\\", we saw him meet his demise.  Where others have failed; Dr. Soong has successfully transplanted his memories into one of his creations.<br /><br />There are lots of references to the work of Flint, Dr. Rodger Korby (from the original series) and Data's Grandfather in the NG episode, \\"The Schizoid Man\\".  All of the above contributed in some way to Dr. Soong's  creation of Data.<br /><br />But I digress; the main premise of this book involves the mystery of  the missing androids.  B-4, Lal, Data's daughter, his android mother, and Dr. Soong.  They are being kept at Starfleet headquarters under the guidance of Captain Maddox.  The same character that tried to claim Data was Starfleet's property.<br /><br />Almost the entire novel takes place in a flashback, when Dr. Soong was constructing Data.  In the last chapters we are taken to the current timeline.  Without spoiling the entire mystery of the book, we see who and why the androids were kidnapped.  If you saw the Next Generation episode, \\"Measure of a Man\\" ,  the premise behind the book will reveal itself.<br /><br />In the opening and closing chapters of the book we get to see Worf being groomed for a captaincy by Picard.  We get to see more of Geordi LaForge joining Picard and some of his new crew to unravel the truth behind the dilemma.<br /><br />Since this book is part of a trilogy, I'd have to give it a five out of five stars.  David Mack is one of the few Star Trek authors that keep the reader interested from beginning to end.  There are no excess wordy exposition or unnecessary details in his novels.
B0015AARJI|5.0|You can't go wrong with original Sony controllers.  I purchased two aftermarket controllers that only lasted 3 months.  Spend the extra money and get the real thing.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Rating:<br />After I was put to sleep by the last Bond film, I was not up for another. But with all the big critical reviews, I thought i would give this one a shot. I am glad I did. This one grabbed me from the opening sequence with Bond on a high speed chase on motorcyles, that included going across the roofs of buildings and culminating in his apparent death.<br /><br />As the film progresses, someone has cracked Interpol's computers and gotten a list of every agent working undercover throughout the world. The perpetrator starts posting the list on the Internet putting the agents at risk. He also seems to have it in for M. Meanwhile, M is told to take an involuntary retirement for the mess that has been created.<br /><br />Bond is then resurrected (never explained exactly how) and it is up to him to help M find who has done the evil deeds. The evildoer this time is played by Javier Bardeem who is one of the most psycho villiains to be seen in a Bond flick. Bardeem is a former agent who was once sold out by M (note: at the beginning of the film Bond is also sold out by her but he holds no grudge). He will always be one step ahead of the good guys. Bond is going through a crisis himself as he is no longer a youngster and many of his skills are not as sharp as they once were.<br /><br />In this film we will learn a little about Bond's childhood and what had made him such a good agent. This movie is a standalone good film that anyone can enjoy without having seen the two prior Craig installments.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|Riot is a great CD with music that will have you jamming out with a smile on your face.  Paramore is one of those rare bands that never seems to steer their fans wrong with their music.  There isn't one song on this CD that I didn't like.  Give this CD a shot, I know you will like it.
B004ZBFRTY|4.0|I bought it because I thought I wanted to see Jake in a different type of role.  I did!  Movie too dark for him.  Would like to see some more comedy that is intended to be comedy.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The Expendables 2 features a ton of legends kicking butt and taking names in a fun, high octane, action film.  This movie is ten times better than the first and is certain to entertain you.  I highly recommend The Expendables 2.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|This album is great for easy listening.  I love his style of singing other people's songs that changes the flow.  He is also excellent at Hawaiian songs.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This is one of those rare CD's that you buy where you wind up liking every single song.  The music featured in Brand New Eyes is some of Paramore's best yet and will keep me rocking for some time to come.  You won't be disappointed with this CD if you give it a shot.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I thought it was good.  It did remind me a lot of The Hunger Games with the resistence.  I was hooked from the time I finished the first chapter and I am definetly going to read the sequels.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Every song on this album is beautiful to listen to.  There honestly isn't one that's not worth your time.  Florence Welch's voice will move you and keep you playing this album well into the morning.  I highly recommend Ceremonials.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is a piece of art that will grip your attention from beginning to end.  The movie has amazing special effects, brilliant acting and a story for the ages.  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is a perfect film for the whole family and a film that you should not miss out on.
B001FOPODS|2.0|I bought it for Christmas and family movie time, but OMG it was dark and creepy. This is not the version I remembered from childhood. I may look again. My son has been to Ukraine and said it looked very similar. But otherwise, a bust.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe puts all thought of Harry Potter behind him with his performance in, 'The Woman in Black.'  His performance was highly impressive and the movie was too.  The writing, directing and acting were all top notch making for one, entertaining film.  I highly recommend, 'The Woman in Black.'

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found the book to be very interesting in content and writing style. I like the way that the near death experience was  told early in the story. I found this book to be comforting after losing my daughter several years ago to an untimely death, especially having been written by a credible source who presented his case very convincingly.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I really didn't want to read about a young wife and mother dying of cancer, but it was told through the eyes of the pet dog.  This makes the whole story a joy to read.  It's amazing how many life lessons you can learn from a dog, a very smart, loving dog!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|its very fast n challenging to play at difficult levels<br />computer Ai is good and u need good placement n timing to beat it<br />graphics slightly better than stick figures
0385535147|3.0|Good effort by Grisham...very meticulous details and well-crafted story.  Two problems for me: I figured out the basic story and ending before hitting the novel's midpoint; and when Grisham introduced a certain important character later in the book it appeared that he had already discussed the character earlier.  When it became obvious this character played a vital role I wasted over an hour back-tracking to find mention of him, only to learn later that in fact he had not actually been mentioned.<br /><br />A fast and enjoyable read, though...
B000RO9VJK|5.0|This book is full of little gems on structuring and running a small business; but it explained so much more beyond that.  I found the principles were very applicable in a company setting among employees, where among your co-workers you can find Technicians, Managers and Entrepreneurs.

0670026182|5.0|You MUST buy this cook book! It got me so inspired that I made seven recipes in seven days and they have all been delicious! This is not your run-of-the-mill pretentious cook book, it's recipes that have been lovingly put together and are easy enough to cook. Katie says that each recipe has been tried and tested and it must be true because everything I've made so far has turned out just like the picture (who hasn't been disappointed by a dish that fails and wasted ingredients because the recipe was wrong!). The best thing about this book is that it's home cooking at it's best and the photography is so beautiful. The only difficult part is choosing which recipe to cook! I'm working my way cooking through this book. Trust me, you'll love it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon and Eva continue their tremulous relationship in the second book of the Crossfire series. The story begins immediately where the first ends with these two broken individuals jumping feet first into a real relationship, something neither of them understand.  Can two people of abuse ever understand how to have a health relationship?<br /><br />Oh wow.  Where Bared to You was fifty-shades-esque, Reflected in You leaves any comparisons behind and solidifies a unique, emotional story.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon are very similar with their jealousy and traumatic pasts.  Also, neither understands how to have a healthy relationship.  The story is incredibly dark and these two characters struggle.  A lot.  No, this is not a happy book, but emotionally realistic.<br /><br />Luckily, Eva and Gideon realize they are both broken and ask for help in the form of couple's therapy.  Unfortunately, the therapist recommends a slower, normal relationship and to not see each other as much.  But, what is \\"normal\\"?  Although the relationship is new, Eva and Gideon rely on each other more than each will admit.  This reliance is both sweet and dysfunctional.<br /><br />The book is a character study where the plot focuses on the struggles between Eva and Gideon.  Also, the plot highlights Eva facing her abusive past and toward healing.  But, as with anything concerning Eva and Gideon, healing may not necessarily be normal or healthy.<br /><br />Reflected in You is darkly emotional and addictive.  Don't expect to leisurely read this book.  No, this book grabs you and keeps you close.  Whereas the second book in a trilogy is usually the weakest, the second Crossfire book leaves the first in the shadows.  The worst part about Reflected in You is finishing it and the long wait for the next installment.  Yeah, I'm going to say it:  Better than Fifty Shades.<br /><br />Read. This. Series.<br /><br />BookingIt Grade:  A
014241493X|3.0|I got turned on to John Green about a year ago. I have read all his stuff so far and truly loved some of them. An aboundance of Katherines was pure genius. Alaska was also excellent. Paper towns just dragged along too much. I never felt anything for Margo. She was just a purpose for Q in my opinion. She was justa reason for his character to do something special. She wasn't developed enough in my opinion. I enjoyed Radar, Lacey, and Ben. I felt that they were the true stars of the book. Unlike AAOK, Paper Towns felt forced at times and that is not something I have come to expect from a John Green book. Overall, not bad, but not good either.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|As the old Relationship saying goes the quality that you love in the beginning of a relationship ends up being the quality you like the least at the end.  In his previous books the riveting action Peppered with his sarcastic wit made for a book I didn't want to put down.  In this book the lack of action and the incessant sarcastic wit makes for a book I'm finding hard to pick up.  I so wanted to love this book.  I'm not through with it yet I still have hopes that it will turn out good

You'll have greater appreciation for these guys after you read this book and a bit of impatience for presidents who lay claim to the brave, dangerous work they do.
B007N31YFW|5.0|I was totally intrigued by the title, but I did rent it first.  After half an hour, there was no doubt in my mind I would buy it.<br />The premise is simply amazing: a group of 6 percussion \\"terrorists\\" compose and perform a Concerto for a City and Percussion Band\\" in four brutally rhythmic, unforgettable movements: the sound of what most people consider only noise turns into a music of its own. The realization of this project acquires decidedly surrealistic overtones and is a total success. The predominant theme questions the relationship between rhythm and melody in musical creation.  A must-have.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|Honestly, the rest of Wes Anderson's film all are above this one.  Moonrise Kingdom is my least favorite, would not watch it again. The sexualization of the children was very disturbing to watch as an adult...and I don't think that was the point.<br /><br />The cast was, of course, phenomenal but the dialogue and delivery was off.  It was as if he was trying to make a quick version of his past films.  The costumes, sets, and cinematography were excellent and made the film watchable.<br /><br />And I hated the scene where the dog was killed, that was uncalled for and very unnecessary to the plot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final novel in the trilogy is very well written.  I was at first appalled at the way the story was going, but of course due to the excellent writing I was drawn in.  I don't wish to spoil to end, but it fits perfectly.  I will read this trilogy again in about a year, because it was definitely worth my time.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|As I began The Racketeer I was thrilled.  It grabbed my attention as few of Grisham's books have since A Time To Kill and The Firm.  My reaction to the first half of the book was to admire its crisp narrative and sharp dialogue and to think how long it has been since I have read a truly enjoyable page turner.  But then the plot took a turn, and with it the feel of the first half was gone.  It became more ordinary and Hollywood-like.  Ultimately, it fizzled out.  I'm glad I read it, and would recommend it.  But what started out as an excellent novel finished as a summertime beach read.

B005S9EK1S|5.0|This was a beautiful romantic movie. The chemistry between Zac and Taylor was great, and it was nice to see Zac in a more grown up role! The relationship been Zac and the young boy was really great to. That young boy did a wonderful job. This movie has a little bit of everything wrapped up in it. There is war, love, heartbreak, loss, a young boy who learns the true meaning of a best friend, a real jerk of an ex husband, and  a dash of comedy!  The only character I was a little let down on was the judge, but he has a really minimal part in the movie, so it doesn't impact the story at all! So, if you are looking for a great romantic movie, you should definitely check this one out.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have this app on my Motorola Atrix HD phone and I own a Kindle, which I love.  The app on the the other hand leaves a lot to be desired.  It is handy when you are sitting waiting somewhere and need to kill some time, but it takes forever to download a book sometimes and freezes a lot.  The other thing that makes it so hard to use is the fact that it puts your books in either alphabetical order or by author.  That would be great if I only had a few books on it, but I have over a hundred books on my device.  They need to put same the option on the app that you have on your kindle.  The last book or books you downloaded need to show up in your list first.  I download from kindle buffet every day and I don't always remember the titles or the authors. Also being able to tell if you have read any of the book or just being able to see what location you are in the book would help.  This would be a four or five star app in my opinion, if you added these features and fixed the bugs.
0399157565|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved Scarpetta. A smart, clever, intelligent woman w/a male side kick who was a real guy, not some metrosexual lump. The last two books have left a nasty taste in my mouth and this one is no better. All Scarpetta does now is whine, name drop famous brands and bash everyone around her. If this is the way the books are going to keep being written, this fan of Patricia Cornwell's is OUTA here!! Scarpetta is flying to high above what she used to do, to be believeable anymore. There is more trying to impress with name dropping than real writing going on. If you loved the first six to eight books go re-read those like I'm doing and don't bother with the newer books.
B002PNER9U|4.0|Pretty good movie. My friend who saw the musical said it wasn't as good, but it still wasn't bad. The production value is high and it has a good message at the end.

B0098460O4|5.0|YouTube introduced folks who are plugged into current, popular music to Jonathan and Charlotte, two teenagers discovered on Britains Got Talent.  For more seasoned ears, Jonathan and Charlotte should raise eyes towards hope for the fragile future of classical music.  I walk away impressed by their gratefulness, honesty and innocence.  The hype about their success and story is a fine fit for this romantic genre.<br /><br />Setting aside the nonsense written above . . . these two sing pretty darn good individually and as a duo!  I can't wait for more.<br /><br />I noticed several reviews complaining about the sound quality of the CD. There is an exceptionally rich sound on the CD when listening with earbuds (more bass) that matches the YouTube quality.  My speakers have a much lower bass level than the boost given by earbuds.  The CD sounds excellent through speakers although not as rich.  I am spoiled by listening to Jonathan and Charlotte as well as other music through the earbuds.  It takes awhile to adjust to the realities of speakers with any of my CDs.

1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton continues to amaze me as she only gets better and better with each successive novel.  In this, THE SECRET KEEPER, she has created a captivating story that grabs readers from the first scene and doesn't let go until the shocking ending.<br /><br />Told in three time frames, the action is never confusing but masterfully tantalizes the reader with a decades long mystery, revealing bit by bit the story which has smoldered for over fifty years.  Most satisfying of all is that upon being shocked at the ending, I realized that all the clues were there if only I had been able to put them together.  There is no secret person or event coming out of left field---the story is expertly planned and told.<br /><br />We first meet Laurel Nicolson when she, as an impressionable teen, witnesses a horrifying murder committed by her mother, an event that seems strangely at odds with everything she knows about her loving, family-oriented mother.  We are taken back to the 1940's and World War II England to meet this mother as a young woman and her story is the centerpiece of the book, recapturing in vivid detail what is was like to live through the Blitz, to find love, to do penance on a daily basis, and in the end to grasp for possible redemption.<br /><br />We are also able to reconnect with Laurel in 2011 when her mother is dying and time is running out to uncover the mystery that has held both women hostage for a lifetime.  Readers will not soon forget Laurel, Dolly, Vivien, or Jimmy.  Their story is powerful, so interesting, and so revealing about why we cling to what we hold most dear.<br />

B004V7XWEE|5.0|At a most definitive period in my life, Marvin Gaye delivered a single that so captured the times that it felt timeless and of its time that it felt like it was resonating from the inner depths of my soul. No song nor album could have been more descriptive of the formative time of graduating from high school and entering my first semester of college. I became enthralled with every lyric, every professional music turn by The Funk Brothers and, of course, Marvin's brilliant layering of vocals on top of vocals (a decade or so later Quincy Jones would emulate that production and vocal arrangement on the Michael Jackson \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\" projects).<br /><br />The first single and title track felt autobiographical. I had just skirted a possible draft to Vietnam because the following year, 1972, the draft would end. That didn't stop my head from being obsessed with the potential horrors of that draft. It was the first, and pretty much the only war that was captured on American television everyday. (A couple of decades later during the Middle East crisis in Iraq, the nefarious rethuglican leadership fought to not have that war televised). The daily airing of the skirmishes and body bags invaded the evening news, along with political unrest and protest contributed greatly to the end of the draft, and eventually the end of the war. News reporters braved the circumstances and flew with various military units as we fought battles in real time on television. The American public had never seen anything quite like it. And Marvin, via firsthand accounts from his brother Frankie, wrote and sung about that terrible time. Despite the fact that Berry Gordy reportedly resisted releasing it because of its political leanings, the music was very Motown 70s. The original Motown Sound of the 60s had run its course. As the label grew from a powerhouse singles label in the 60s, the 70s meant an upgrade in the Motown sound and the production of one brilliant album after the other. Stevie's golden era began with \\"Where I'm Coming From\\", Diana's acclaimed solo debut also prepared the way for her breathtaking recording of the \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" soundtrack, The Temptations had introduced Norman Whitfield's psychedelic soul that by 1971 perfectly blended their classic balladry with \\"The Sky's the Limit\\" and Smokey was temporarily detoured from launching his solo career as The Miracles experienced one final smash with \\"Tears of a Clown\\", though by 1973, he crafted the gorgeous solo debut simply entitled \\"Smokey\\". (It was a bit inaccurate about Motown solely being a singles labels in the 60s. The Supremes sold 50 million albums from 1964-1969, garnering 3 #1 albums and nearly a 4th. And The Temptations had no less than 5 Top 10-15 albums in the same time period, sharing a #1 with Diana Ross and The Supremes).<br /><br />Back to \\"What's Going On\\", the next track was a sequel of sorts \\"What's Happening Brother\\" which seemingly by osmosis, I yearn to hear right after the title track as the album invaded my soul. But, the album was released almost 6 months after the single. Hunger for more caused fans to instantly listen to side 2, a distinctively unique single mix of \\"God is Love\\" that was almost as significant as the title track. In less than 2 minutes, Marvin raised my spirituality with a wondrous lyric and summery musical sound.<br /><br />The 60s were times of great change, experimentation, celebration and hard lessons to learn. Discovering mind altering substances like the organic marihuana would also bring in hashish and man-manufactured drugs like LSD and more profound organic substances like heroin. What came out of the more well to do suburbs, began invading the city tenement housing with more street-tainted versions of these substances that made its way as far as to Vietnam. \\"Flying High in the Friendly Sky\\" captured that experience perfectly. Intriguing, frightening, but, always honest, it was possibly the most cinematic of all the songsMarvin crafted for \\"What's Going On\\". I felt as if I understood the allure of the first peaks that made those harder substances so powerful. But within 5 minutes, Marvin took the journey into its darkest corners.<br /><br />Just as we protest the war, the evolution of the women's liberation movement and the gay liberation movement, we were also aware of how disrespectful many of us had become of the environment. \\"Mercy, Mercy Me\\", the second single was one of the strongest anthems addressing the environment. Not quite as devastating as \\"Flying High in the Friendly Sky\\", \\"Mercy, Mercy Me\\" was no less arresting. Adapted by many environmental non-profits, it was a good song, written and sung with passion. It became his second Top 5 smash from the opus.<br /><br />After embracing my spirituality, the sequencing of \\"Save the Children\\" was very appropriate. I was always self-aware of the suffering around me, a lot of it because of fatherless homes, hardworking single mothers and children having to pay the price for something they did not create. Diana would combine it with \\"Brown Baby\\" the next year for one of the best medleys of its time. It also became the theme of one of the biggest festivals for healing our impoverished neighborhoods. Jesse Jackson spearheaded this festival, Motown provided the soundtrack and Marvin Gaye spearheaded a performance for the 1972 movie. Marvin sung passionately about our need to step outside ourselves and guide our children to a brighter tomorrow.<br /><br />The album version of \\"God is Love\\" closed out side two. The arrangement was slower and took awhile to get used to. Remember, I had lived with the \\"What's Going On\\" b/w \\"God is Love\\" single for several months. I eventually learned to appreciate both versions, though the single version still manages to out emote the album version. It was also descriptive of Marvin's heavy religious training. That was something very familiar to me as my family home was inundated with religious artifactsin nearly every room in our home. My mother placed a half size statue of the Virgin Mary, with the snake at her feet that gave me many chills on a given night. I could always reach for \\"God is Love\\" for solace.<br /><br />Side 2 opens up with the very urban snapshot of \\"Right On\\". After President Johnson's \\"Great Society\\" tried to address the staggering inner city poverty that was rising from the large tenement dwellings, Marvin captured the energy of the community to try and fight back against the beauracy. The inner city struggles collided with our awareness of self and community. As I often tried to explain, the black community from 1964-1970 morphed first from the somewhat condescending \\"colored\\" to the more distinguished but often misunderstood \\"negro between 1965-68, until James Brown gave identity to our burgeoning self pride in 1968 with \\"Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud\\" and the \\"black\\" experience, finally into the edification of a large portion of the black man's history by 1970's declaration of \\"African-American\\". Out of those profound changes came the affirmation, \\"Right On\\" that Marvin seemed to understand thoroughly.<br /><br />As the pain and pleasure of that era came full circle, Marvin would again hold onto his religious upbringing underscored by his new identity as a \\"spiritualist\\". None other than the fractured blend of religion and spirituality led to the awakening in \\"Wholy, Holy\\". It is a battle that would continue to resonate years to come as his next opus, \\"Let's Get it On\\" into \\"I Want You\\" would show his struggles between. The carnal and the spiritual. Musically, \\"Wholy Holy\\" often felt like a moment of grace. Aretha would record it the next year for her iconic \\"Amazing Grace\\" album. That alone meant that no artist blended his still evolving lessons from the more structured awareness to the defining confines of judgment.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Inner City Blues\\" was the final frontier. As much as I wished it all had a tidy ending, Marvin again reflected on the challenges that at times seem to show us a brighter path, but, too often it also demonstrated just how much negativity there would be on the journey to serenity. It scripted the confusion. Marvin tapped into his jazz-leanings. Marvin could write a love song so stirring as \\"If This World Were Mine\\" to the plaintive relaying in \\"Inner City Blues\\". It is no surprised that many contemporary jazz artists would cover this song for years to come. \\"inner City Blues\\" did indeed tell you \\"What's Going On\\". But it wasn't a sweet, tidy package that could be sourced at a moment's whim. He sung the lyrics through the lens of honesty.<br /><br />Subsequent editions of this monumental masterpiece, the final album recorded at Hitsville, the final album when all The Funk Brothers would be as one and one of the final Motown/Detroit releases. Marvin took the bold step of performing the entire album at the Kennedy Center in his hometown of Washington D.C. It was brilliant. He decided not to perform the album in its original sequence. It was a bit jarring after living with the album on a daily basis. So as I expected to hear a given song upon completion of the one before it, the live experience simply opened up another way to listen to this body of work.<br /><br />Marvin spent countless hours on this project though he described the experience with ease. The 40th Anniversary brings together all elements of the work he had cultivated over a two year period. There are a number of instrumentals that were never crafted into full songs with lyrics. You get a sense that he was living in an extended moment in God somewhere in time and space.<br /><br />So many so called musicologists wanted to relegate Motown to a singles label, but, in reality, as the 70s began Stevie was crafting his golden period of albums beginning with 1971's \\"Where I'm Coming From\\", Diana had immersed herself in Lady Day's catalog to come up with the sorely underrated #1 album, \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" after crafting her brilliant Ashford & Simpson debut, The Temptations guided by Norman Whitfield changed the sound of music with \\"Cloud Nine\\", Smokey was a bit delayed in crafting \\"Quiet Storm\\" though his self-titled debut was no sleeper. In fact, Motown welcomed the 70s with high quality albums that continue to resonate a near half century later. Diana proved no fluke with the excellent Adult Contemporary, \\"Touch Me in the Morning\\" album, Marvin began his soul deep albums from this masterpiece to the misunderstood, \\"In My Lifetime\\" as his Columbia debut bristled with wild, new haunting sounds.........graduating in 1971, \\"What's Going On\\" proved to be quite revealing for my classmates and I and I began to buy almost any album on Motown, as the label graduated from great records to classic albums!
B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|That's right, children I said - Album! Stick it!<br />This is a really good listen from Whitesnake. IF you have never heard of them (your twelve - move on), you could pick this up and you WILL buy their whole back catalog.
1878424319|5.0|This book is deceptively small and simple, just like the Four Agreements it espouses.  Simple, but not easy.  I found it to be best read slowly, a bit at a time, taking moments to digest the wisdom found with the small pages.<br />I've summarized the book, to give you a feel for its contents, but you should read it yourself, because it will move you in a different way.<br /><br />1.  Be impeccable with your word.  Speak with integrity.  Say only what you mean.  Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.  Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.<br />2.  Don't take anything personally.  Nothing others do is because of you.  What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream.  When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.<br />3.  Don't make assumptions.  Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.  With just this one agreement you can completely transform your life.<br />4.  Always do your best.  Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.  Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.<br /><br />Quotes I like:<br />\\"If you abuse yourself very badly, you can even tolerate someone who beats you up, humiliates you, and treats you like dirt.  Why? Because in your belief system your say `I deserve it.  This person is doing me a favor by being with me.  I'm not worthy of love and respect.  I'm not worthy of love and respect.  I'm not good enough.\\"<br /><br />\\"Through the word you express your creative power.  It is through the word that you manifest everything.  What you dream, what you feel, and what you really are, will all be manifested through the word.\\"<br /><br />\\"The word is not just asound or a written symbol.  The word is a force; it is the power you have to express and communicate, to think, and thereby to create the events in your life.  The word is the most powerful tool you have as a human; it is the tool of magic.\\"<br /><br />\\"If someone is not treating you with love and respect, it is a gift if they walk away from you.  Walking away may hurt for a while, but your heart will eventually heal.  Then you can choose what you really want.\\"<br /><br />\\"Often when you go into a relationship with someone you like, you have to justify why you like that person.  Your love will not change anybody.  If others change, it's because they want to change, not because you can change them.\\"<br /><br />\\"We don't need to justify love; it is there or not there.  Real love is accepting other people the way they are without trying to change them.  If we try to change them, this means we don't really like them.\\"<br /><br />The long meditation example, the master replied: \\"You are not here to sacrifice your joy or your life.  You are here to live, to be happy, and to love.\\"<br /><br />\\"Inaction is the way that we deny life.  Inaction is sitting in front of the television every day for years because you are afraid to be alive and to take the risk of expressing what you are.  Expressing what you are is taking action.  You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action.\\"<br /><br />\\"You were born with the right to be happy.

0316228532|5.0|I have never read Harry Potter, but when I saw she had written a book for adults I had to read it. I loved the book,and couldn't put it down. It does have alot of characters and goes back and forth, but I couldn't wait to see what was next with them. Its a thought provoking book. I finished it 2 days ago and still thinking about the different people and their lives.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent, fast-paced, and informative novel, enlivened by John Corey's observations and wise-a-- humor.  DeMille's novels are worth waiting for, and he maintains his high quality over the years. I have read all of his books, and anticipate a sequel to \\"Panther,\\"  given how the book ends.  A great purchase from Amazon for my Kindle!

B007CBEO20|1.0|There was a reason why they were a good 80's hair band. There's none of that here. I hate to say it but whatever it was that made them good back then - it's gone. Maybe it's the actual hair - I dunno. Even the singer doesn't really sound the same. I mean - it sounds like they got someone who sounds a lot like him and went on without him (like so many are doing these days: Journey, Styx, Foreigner - You get the idea.). If it was an unknown band and this was their first album it would be in the .99 cent bin.
1594203334|5.0|Parents wanting to raise their kids thoughtfully and learn from different cultures will likely find this book helpful and entertaining. It's a memoir by an American expatriate mother living in France, documenting her investigation of French parenting.<br /><br />It's not that I necessarily agree with everything here. I don't think that's the point. The idea isn't that the French do parenting perfectly or that everyone should thoughtlessly copy them. Rather, the point is that while some French parenting practices may seem foreign to Americans, many of them really make sense and are very helpful and amazingly successful. And there is some clear evidence of better results.<br /><br />Unlike many parenting books and memoirs, this book is actually written in a skillful, fun and fresh way. It is intimate and emotional but not overly sentimental either. Even though it describes a mom's perspective, dads can enjoy it too! In fact, even if you never have had, and never will have, any children, it's unlikely you'll find this dull!

B008PE9GSA|4.0|Very good new album by the legendary trio known as ZZTOP.  I am not sure where this ranks within their discography, and frankly I don't care.  Its a fine collection of songs and there are some moments where they really re-capture that familiar sound they used to have.  This album is not like their 80s stuff.  Its more reminiscent of the 70s.  There is some great rock and roll here as well as some very fine slow blues tunes.<br /><br />If you area big fan of this band then this is totally worth getting.

If you are a child of listening to albums on really good headphones on really good &#34;stereos&#34;, back in the day, ex: Pink Floyd - The Wall, Dark Side Of The Moon, Rush - 2112, etcetera..........Then you WILL appreciate all this has to offer to the headphone crowd.
0765350386|5.0|This book is one that keeps you up until the late hours, one that you say you'll just finish the chapter you're on, but you wind up two hours later still reading. A big thing in this book for me is its uniqueness, it offers an original setting, plot twist, and use of \\"magic\\", throughout its pages. The allomancy is just beautifully done, everything comes together and makes it one of the best \\"magic systems\\" that I'd ever read about before. The setting is described beautifully at some points, but at others not so much. Still when the picture is painted for you, you can feel it. One thing that bothered me during the book was how shallow all of the other helping characters were. The author seemed to of not given enough detail to the other characters. The book has twists in every one of its chapters, making again, a book that is hard to put down. I give this book a 5 out of 5 for its uniqueness, vivid settings, and thrilling story line.
B003Y3ZHUS|5.0|This is more a review based on the quality of the Blu-ray than an overview of the film.  If you're a fan of slasher films or giallo horror, then this is well known as a masterpiece.  It is a giallo classic, and it is a precursor to the slasher film.  It's also one colorful, strangely motivated trip of a film.  It is also available in the 2nd Bava boxed-set, in DVD format, and as a single disc release.  As a horror film, the work is genius. Bava was a master, and this is one gory murder expose.  The kill scenes were instant classics in their time, and the film has aged as well as Bava's earlier works like the beautifully gothic Black Sunday, or the giallo masterpiece, Blood and Black Lace.  Yet, it remains incomparable to them in certain ways, and is more comparable to those he influenced including Argento and Fulci, and it's clear that his camerawork in this film helped take the stalker viewpoint into the slasher perspective, something that influenced his future counterparts in America during the late 70s and 80s slasher advance.<br /><br />A summary of the film... people trespass at the wrong place at the wrong time, and the title holds true to the film, as there is a vicious and multi-seeded land dispute going on as the backstory.  Bava elevated the disturbance of the audience through dedicated violence and dread-based suspense, rather than the atmospheric suspense he relied upon in his films from the 60s.  This film was a turning point for Bava, in ways, this work really let him stretch out.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD was good, a lot better than the VHS recording I grew up with.  However, when the Blu-ray came out, I knew it was one of the few films from the 70s that I was interested in purchasing.  I feel that it is only natural for a lot of people to be particular about which Blu-rays they wish to purchase, because, for many, they're upgrading from a film they might already own.  Also, some films don't transfer as well as audiences would hope, or the proper prints are not used.  This is not the case here.  The Blu-ray quality is superb.  The video is 1080P, and the bitrate is more than double the previous DVD release.  The colors are crisp, the sound is truly great- especially in the English release, even the dubs aren't poor.  The price is a little steep, but I found it on here from an independent seller and spent less than $20.  Well worth my money, also, anyone who is a Mario Bava fan probably skipped this review and already added to cart.  The Blu-ray comes with a great booklet with a superb 7 page overview of Bava, giallo, Bay of Blood etc... Also, it has an awesome, double-sided poster of both theatrical release posters (as pictured) and alternative red/black poster.<br /><br />NOTE:  The English language version of the film is the version that they used for the high definition.  The original Italian version is included in the same print (I believe) as the previous DVD release, which is fine. Great film. Great artist- Bava has screenwriting and cinematography credits for Bay of Blood.  Let the blood bath begin.per prints are not used.  This is not the case here.  The Blu-ray quality is superb.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|Great bio and great example of the power of human will. I strongly recommend this book for everybody who pushes for any big goals. However after I read an interview with his key pacer  Dusty I found Scott Jurek not so trustful as I hoped it was.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|I saw the unbelievably good reviews for this book and bought it.  Anyone notice that it has more and higher reviews than \\"On the Beach\\", \\"Earth Abides\\", \\"Alas, Babylon\\", and \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\\"?  Does anything seem suspicious to you here?  Well guess what, it should.  This book is nowhere near the level of any of those books.  It isn't bad; the writing is decent.  It's a solid 3-4 out of 5.  The main problem is that it's padded out more than it should be, making the story unravel slower than to my taste.  I am halfway through and probably will not finish.  But some people will enjoy the book; it has decent writing, some decent characters and some decent ideas.  Decent, not fantastic.  My main problem with it is that I feel I was tricked into buying, by unbelievably positive reviews.  If you have not already read the classics that I mentioned above, do not start with Wool; it's not on the same level.<br /><br />BTW, I found Wool somewhat derivative of \\"Level 7\\" by Roshwald.  Level 7 is superior because it came first and is a much tighter story.

There was far less description of his experience with heaven. As a Christian, I question his validity.

B009AMALLM|1.0|From the success of the first paranormal activity we got suspense and mystery behind the activity taking place. With this fourth entry in the franchise the mystery and suspense has become non-existent. The question we have to ask ourselves is where is this going? And why? Nothing really happens in this installment as the majority of the time you see people recording things for some unknown reason; until activity starts happening which is like 30 minutes into it. The other element is the technology being used to record the events. Its not that laptops are a bad idea to record events but when it seems like a dozen laptops are being used around the house instead of cameras makes it ridiculous. In any event, the weak part of this movie is the script. More jump scares are being utilized rather than true suspense; well with an exception of the last ten minutes of the movie. It is clear that the studio is looking for a cash grab and will continue to dish out sequels until diminishing returns kicks in. In contrast, the Saw movies may have blown its wad after the third installment, but what made the franchise so successful was not only the traps but the story.  There was progression with the Saw movies in terms of story; rather Paranormal Activity jumps in timeline to the event where there is no clear direction to where the story is headed. The Saw movies had fun messing with the timelines (Saw 3,4, and 5), but Paranormal acts as stand-alone films with a strand of story from the first movie. The big problem is keeping the viewer engaged with whats going on in the movie; however, the majority of the run-times have had little to nothing going on. From the first movie everything was fresh and a mystery, but with sub-sequent installments the audience is familiar with what to expect and nothing has changed in terms of directing. Paranormal Activity 4 is clearly the weakest of the series, which is unfortunate because some the performances from the actors are descent. With the green-light of Paranormal Activity 5 in October 2013 and a latino-spinoff in the Spring, only one can hope that there is a clear direction as to where this is all going. In my opinion, nowhere.n-light of Paranormal Activity 5 in October 2013 and a latino-spinoff in the Spring, only one can hope that there is a clear direction as to where this is all going.

1439102732|5.0|This book sat on my To-Be-Read shelf way too long and I am kicking myself. What a fantastic story! Picoult again shines as she takes on several hot topics, gay rights, alcoholism, Evangelical Christian beliefs, divorce, troubled teens and more. Same-sex marriage/definition of family was the main issue and the author showed all sides. This book came out in early 2011 and people's views on the main premise of the story continue to evolve and had the outcome of the election been different this evolution may have stopped and took a giant step backward.<br /><br />Zoe Baxter battle with infertility was heartbreaking and after 10 years of in vitro fertilization, several miscarriages, and a stillborn baby, her marriage just crumbles. Her husband, Max, is ready to give up on having a child and Zoe just can't.<br /><br />This story took me on a emotional roller coaster which is what this author's stories always do. I become heavily invested in these character's lives. I really wanted to hate Max but couldn't. I hated the bigotry of the people around him and the way they used him to promote their own agenda at a time in his life when he was weak and needing guidance. Zoe's life from her music therapy clients to her life with Vanessa warmed by heart. After all she had been through to be strong enough to still put other people's needs first was so inspiring.<br /><br />Sadly the accompanying CD did not come with my copy but it was not necessary to have music for me to be moved by this story. I devoured the almost 500 pages very quickly. I am sure many excellent book club discussions have taken place about this book as people's feeling on these issues will run the gambit.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book (as the third in the Heroes of Olympus series) was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!! I was hooked until the very end! It took me maybe three to four days to read this six hundred or so page book, as I was so absorbed in it! The whole plot and story have constantly been on my mind, and I finished the book over a month ago! I absolutely cannot wait for the next book, The House of Hades (due to come out October 2013)! A must read!

B0085A9J18|4.0|The Raid-Redemption(Released Sept/11)is an Indonesian film starring director Gareth Evans find,Iko Uwais as Rama,Donny Alamsyah as Andi,Ray Sahetapy as Tama Riyadi,Yayan Ruhian as Mad Dog,Pierre Gruno as Lieutenant Wahyu,Joe Taslim as Sergeant Jaka and others.This is a fast paced,hold on to your seat film,that never stops giving with the action and intensity.<br />The film opens as Rama,a cop,is at home,with his pregnant wife,preparing for a mission.In the SWAT truck on the way with his fellow police team,we learn they are all headed into a high rise apartment building.The building has been a drug and crime haven for years,presided over by one Tama.The hit is led by a Lieut.Wayhu.<br />Once inside the team goes undetected until about the 5th floor when all hell breaks loose.The building has an open square core to it,from which all hallways radiate from.It is an easily defended scenario and the tenants,many doing Tama's bidding,use this to their advantage,killing many cops all too quickly.The highest the team makes it to is the 7th floor and from there their decimated numbers must go downwards.To this end they literally chop open a hole in apartment floors and slip down that way.This only gets them a couple of floors,after which they must try to get out other ways.This ends up splitting the team up and decimating their numbers even more.<br />Along the way we learn that Lieut.Wayhu has put together this action by himself,with no ones authorization,r knowledge.Furthermore Wayhu himself has been a collector of debts for those corrupt officials higher up than himself,and figures wiping out Tama will score him brownie points with his bosses.Meanwhile Tama has sent forth two of his enforcers to comb the building for the now,four cops left.One,Mad Dog,is brutal,crazy and relentless.He confronts one cop,takes him into a room,and instead of using his gun to quickly dispatch him,fights him hand to hand.The ultimate result is not good for the cop.The other enforcer,Andi,kills the two men sent down the elevator with him.He then hides in a room and grabs Rama as he wanders by in the hallway and pulls him in.The two start a rather nonchalant conversation,the end result of which we find the two are estranged brothers.Rama tries to convince his brother to come with him,but he cannot leave the world he feels the most comfortable in.<br />Andi tells Rama to leave once the coast is clear,then leaves to join Mad Dog.Mad Dog drags the dead cops body up to his boss,while of course Andi has nothing to show for his walkabout.Tama unfortunately,has watched his security monitors and has seen Andi's betrayal.Tama lets Mad Dog take Andi to a room and torture him.Rama leaves the room and re joins Wayhu and the only cop left to protect him,Dagu.They work their way up to the top floor,and Rama temporarily leaves the two when he finds the room with Mad Dog and his brother.An epic battle takes place between the brothers and Mad Dog,taking all they have to defeat their ruthless foe.Up on the 15th floor the Lieut.has taken Tama hostage and has killed Dagu.As Wayhu comes down the stairs they meet up with the brothers,who he shoots at and who flee a little ways down.They listen to the conversation,as Tama lays out what has been going on with Wayhu's bosses,who will be none too pleased that Wayhu has taken it upon himself to snuff out a very lucrative source of income for them.Wayhu shoots Tama,then turns the gun on himself,except there are no bullets with which to end it all.Rama takes Wayhu into custody,finds one last remaining severally injured cop,and the three cops walk out of the apartment compound,with Andi's help.As the gate closes we see Rama leave and Andi walking back into the world he knows best.<br />The fight scenes are choreographed extremely well and the tension created rarely wains,as the cops are at first in control,then later fighting for their lives to get out.The criminals in this building,all seem to be in various states of drug inducement:wide eyed and totally devoid of a conscious.It is nothing for them to machete a person to death.The film is filled with very violent scenes like that which are not for the squeamish.One plot hole that I found that stuck out was when the drug lord outed Andi.He said he saw Andi pull his brother into a room,which of course condemned Andi to death.The building was indeed filled with cameras everywhere.So I do not know how the cops made it all the way to the fifth floor in the beginning,without being detected until a kid outed them,over just an intercom.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound and include:six featurettes,video blogs,a clay-mation version of The Raid and conversation with the director and others.<br />All in all this film has action is spades,with lots and lots of your typical Hong Kong style martial arts sequences.It is a taut good vs evil film,with a team of cops raiding a drug lord's apartment fortress.Things move well for the cops at the start,but it goes downhill quickly and they all must fight for their lives in short order.A solid four

I am very thankful for the Kindle though....I don't need to be walking around with everyone knowing what I'm reading lol  Very excited about talk about a movie...  I wonder who will play Christian???
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book was entertaining, however let lacked the gripping interest of it's predecessor. This seamed rushed and under developed. It also lacked the romantic heat of the first book. I will read the third book in the series but I hope it is better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Finished this one within a few days.  Sacrificed sleep to get some reading in!  I cannot wait till the next one...I want things to work out for Gideon and Eva, they are likeable yet \\"damaged\\" characters.  These novels will surely be ones I reread later!  Enjoy!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This was a very good episode and the quality from Amazon is great. All you need for your instant zombie needs
B0054JZC6E|5.0|We have a lot of fun with the games on this APP!! We take this everywhere and it intertains all of us.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the soltaire game is fun to play and quite realistic<br />As good as on my computer and I would recommend it
B008B68IEA|4.0|The ice bed does look a little different in person than it does in the promo images.  It's much whiter in person, made of an irridescent but transluscent plastic.  The bed comes with a TV (showing an ice boarding game), drink, lava lamp, and alarm clock). It also comes with her pet Shiver's little ice bed and a diary.  A pink snowflake pillow and flimsy sheet complete the set.<br /><br />In all, it's a cute little set and great for displaying abbey when she isn't being played with or moved around.  She mostly sits in it - can be kind of tight if you lay her down. The fabric sheet is kind of flimsy - doesn't have any sewn edges and looks like someone grabbed a scrap of fabric (the other bed sets had better quality).<br /><br />The shimmery plastic of the bed is nice and the two stalks of trees on either side of her bed have sparkles on them rather than being the colorful plastic.  At the top of her bed is a MH skull wearing ear muffs.  I knock it down 1 start due to the cheapness of the fabric but this is a good buy at the $21.99 price!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have some blood sugar issues and after three days, going wheat free seems to have fixed me up.  I'll update this review in the future... I am very hopeful so far.  If I can lose 20 pounds as well, that will be a nice christmas present!  No weight loss to report yet.<br /><br />I resisted buying this book for quite some time... the title is so ugly!!!<br /><br />I was shocked to learn that wheat has a much higher glycemic index than table sugar!  Eating straight sugar is much healthier!<br /><br />One month update:  My blood sugar issue seems to have been cured by nearly eliminating wheat!  I'm very grateful.  No weight loss so far.<br /><br />I'm still hoping for a weight loss dividend.  I'll do another update in a month or two.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great to have on my Kindle.  It's easy to use, works well, and handles all of the calculations I need.  The price could not be beat!!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I purchased this cooling fan since AMD's stock fan for their new chips are bad. (Loud noise and not good at cooling) This fan is relatively quiet and constantly cools my CPU to around 45C when gaming. The noise coming from the fan picks up slightly under load, but its still nothing to complain much about since I can barely hear it over the case fan.<br /><br />Installation was easy, only the spacing/mounting for the heatsink was an issue to fit within the motherboard. (Antec One Case, ASROCK 990GX Extreme 3 motherboard, Patriot Viper Memory, AMD 8320) The size of the fan(s)/heatsink really factor in when setting up the 2 fan configuration (which is optional, doesn't come with the second fan though) within the case, but right now I think one fan is plenty for me. Another thing to note is that it should come with thermal compound. A pea sized dot on the center of the CPU worked well. Plenty of coverage on the base of the heatsink and CPU.<br /><br />Overall, its a good cooler for the price at $25, my only complaint is the heatsink is bulky. But for it's size, the Hyper 212+ a great performer and I am glad purchased this to replace the stock fan.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Javier Bardin's villain is the most memorable villain to hit a Bond film since Ernst Stavro Blofield was last seen in \\"Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" and I don't count Jaws as a villain (cartoon characters really aren't scary).  This Bond film has an edge, and real violence and nastiness that other Bond films sometimes lack.  The personal beef the villain has with our main characters is the driving force of this movie, and Bardin brings a performance home that if it weren't in a Bond film could be Oscar-worthy.<br /><br />Craig is excellent, and the supporting cast is boosted by Ralph Fienes, and other newcomers who will populate future Bond films.  Read summaries in other reviews if you must, but from the retro-theme song by Adele down to the ending with Miss Moneypenny, this film has got the good stuff.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young and Crazy Horse release a great double album.  This is a special disc of fuzz-toned rock, that America needs, with all it's teenage bubble gum crap out there.  \\"Psychedelic Pill\\", begins with the 27 minute \\"Driftin' Back\\", this has all the hallmarks of Neil Young here, sounds like  The Byrds in the middle, great song!  The title track is his party track.  \\"Ramada Inn\\", is pure Neil Young  and Crazy Horse, \\"Born In Ontario\\", takes Neil back to his roots, \\"Twisted Road\\", growing up in the 50's and listening to the Dead on the radio in the 60's, \\"She's Always Dancing\\", is sparkling rocker, \\"For the Love Of Man\\", is the quietest number here,  and the killer \\"Like A Giant\\", which reminds me of 1981 Crazy Horse and has a slight stomp of \\"Hey Hey\\", in the song, simply awesome work by the 66 year-old Neil Young.  Also thanks to \\"Billy Talbot, Ralph Molina and Poncho Sampedro.  I would recommend this to anyone that like's fuzz-toned rock and for people that enjoy true rock and roll!
0439023513|3.0|[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]<br />Suzanne Collins has written once again, an amazing brilliant Book. I absolutely love the premise of these books, however I am concerned with the premise of kill or be killed and the violence aimed at the YA readers.<br /><br />I am worried that I am worried, as I don't believe in censoring books and encourage everyone to read. However in today's world of social media, and a generation that is so easily influenced,it is nonetheless disturbing. I dislike that being disturbed was the main thing I took away from this series.<br /><br />Now it is in Hollywood's hands, which makes it doubly worrisome. All the Young Adults want to emulate the main character, to the point of taking archery lessons. That in itself is frightening, as kids are able to purchase cross bows, what are they thinking by doing this?<br /><br />So as you can tell I have very mixed feelings on this book. Excellent writing by Suzanne Collins, she really draws you into the characters and creates a very surreal futuristic world, which has you rooting for the characters. I couldn't put these books down,but would not recommend them for YA readers
B008QMMEOE|4.0|my two year old didn't even finish one and she walked off. and she never ever ever ever played this agin.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have been playing for 4 days straight! very addictive and attractive design as well. I especially like the increase in difficulty over the levels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as good as the first! Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the third book. Buying it today!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok, so it's not like the pc version, but for an app it is amazing!  Also, I like it better than block story becuse it is less laggy and doesn't have animal spawners. Plus, Minecraft has multiplayer, which me and my brother both enjoy. In other words, it is my favorite app.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This book is not as bad as others say it is, but not as awesome as others say either. To be truthful, the first time I tried reading this book I couldn't even get through the first chapter. I thought the idea of a teenage Goth club in Manhattan was silly at best. Even worse were all the metaphors the author chose to use, not just the sheer amount of them, although that DID get quite annoying after a while, but in the way she used them. Something about bending sideways like a blade of grass if I recall correctly. Um what? Some of them were so weird or obscure I was left scratching my head or laughing at them. Not good.<br /><br />Nevertheless I decided to give this book another try because the YA literary world seems to have a hard on for this series. I'm sort of glad I stuck it through the first chapter. The book has some clever ideas and the plot moved along at a break-neck pace. The writing was decent. I believe if you read something enough, you get used to it. If I could do it with the Hunger Games, surely I can do it here. But I digress...<br /><br />Now I don't know anything about this author's past or what not. I hear she was big in fanfiction. Kudos to her, but this is the big leagues now and sadly a lot of this kind of read a little too much like fanfiction for my tastes. However it was still better than many books I have read in the past, so I am a little conflicted. I wanted to like this book, and I did somewhat, but I think in this case the hype was bigger than the star. There was a lot of info dumping, a whole sleep inducing chapter of it, in fact. And so many plot twists it was borderline melodrama. I felt like I was reading a manuscript for 'All My Children' after a little while. It kept me reading, but by then I could pretty much guess what would happen next.<br /><br />The main character was decent, if not useless for most of the story. Though, as I've mentioned before in other reviews, she has the classic case of the fumbles that seem to occur in most YA books these days. Unless, that is, when they are in the heat of the moment and surprise surprise! Mary Sue throws a knife and it lands perfectly in her target when she has had NO prior experience in knife throwing, or in fighting for that matter. *Sigh*. I don't care if a main character can't fight. That's fine. Just be consistent about it. Clary is a 15 year old girl, so I was able to forgive most of her stupid decisions. Been there, done that. I can't say I was any better at her age.<br /><br />But then another problem arose: No 15 year old speaks the way she does. I get it, she was supposed to be a bookworm, but come on. All the teenagers in this book sported rather mature vocabulary. Not only is it not very believable, but it comes off as a little pretentious.<br /><br />Jace didn't bother me as much as he did to other people. He's a young arrogant teenager. What do you expect? But for someone as 'smart' as him, it made it harder for me to believe the switcharoo he pulled towards the end of the book.<br /><br /> *Spoilers*<br /><br />One of my biggest beefs with the story was with the stupid cup debacle. Why not just go in there and get the card instead of revealing one of the most important artifacts in the world to a questionable `down worlder' witch? Uh, duh. That annoyed me to no end. I thought they were supposed to be smart?<br /><br />The `stele' might as well have been a wand since it was able to do everything under the sun anyway. The mirror rang a little too close to that mirror thing in Harry Potter for my tastes. I would have been able to forgive that if there weren't other glaring similarities to Rowling's beloved series.<br /><br />Finally we come to the end. The one that has been building up for years it seems, and it just sort of fizzles out. Nothing exciting happens. Valentine is nothing to write home about. I like a little bit more flavor to my baddies, and sadly he was pretty bland.<br /><br />And on a final note: I really don't have toomuch of an opinion about the gross incest twist that goes on for a little while... I haven't read the rest of this series yet, but at the rate the soap opera drama is shaping up, I pretty much know how this is going to turn out. Surprise, you're not actually related! You can both make out now. Ew.<br /><br />There is more to say about this book, but I think I've rambled on enough. I'll continue reading these to find out what happens, but I won't be entirely happy about it either.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Drawing with Crayons!  Drawing with Crayons!  Drawing with Crayons!!!<br /><br />  Need I say more?<br />For those of you who haven't heard enough and haven't enthusiastically punched the purchase button, yet...<br />There is the part where you can Draw With Crayons...  what more do you want from your tablet or phone?  This is great!  And there is more!  There are paint brushes... there are color pencils... there are markers, effects markers, and there are alto of background papers!  And I haven't mentioned the Stickers. There are dozens of stickers you can put into your pictures. The stickers are resizable, customizable, and pure dinosaur-iffic t-rex stomping fun-blastic!!!<br /><br />  I made an under water picture with fishies and resized a t-rex then drag-stomped around chasing the fishies ....  Rrrrraaaawwwwrrrrrrrr!!!<br /><br />  I also have sketchpad mobile, and can't figure that thing out. Maybe if I was a goodlier artist, then that might be the dealie-o for superior quality artistry, but I have not had near as much fun as I have had with Drawing Pad with that one.<br /><br />  Now let's hear it one more time!  SHOUT IT OUT LOUD NOW!!!<br /><br />DRAWING WITH CRAYONS!!!  DRAWING WITH CRAYONS!!!  DRAWING WITH CRAYONS!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I was was blown away again (The first time at the cinemas) . It took so long to release the 3d bluray, but finally its here. This is a must have. The bluray 3d is well beyond anything else released in the format.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|After reading Greg Bear's two \\"Halo\\" books ,I had to sample someone else's effort. Nylund does a nice job of depicting a completely different perspective in the same universe. I was pleasantly surprised.
B005LAIIDU|3.0|Wreck it Ralph is not a bad film but it's not great either.<br /><br />The basic plotline and setting are very interesting. The arcade setting of the film is very imaginative and the plot has lots of twists and turns. The characters travel through different arcade games, from serious shooters to candy racing games, and it is all very visually stimulating and incredibly creative.<br /><br />That being said, it's just not funny. There is little to no wit and the only humor is potty humor. The characters are not loveable (maybe not even very likeable) and you don't get attatched to them at all.<br /><br />So, maybe see it once if you don't mind potty humor, but it's not going to be the best animated movie you've ever seen, not even close.<br />(written by my 21 yr old daughter and 12 year old boy)
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Not up to Nelson's usual high standard. The book drags on and on for the first half. I must have ADD. Hopefully he will drop the John & Kate Corey characters for his next book as he is a superb author.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I LOVE this app.  It helps me fall asleep every night.  The only thing I don't like about the app, is that I wish when you select a timer that could be your default until you change it.  I always press 1 hour and I hate that if I wake up in the middle of the night, I have to look at the blaring light to hit timer, 1 hour, and play again.  I would love if an update came out where the timer stayed defaulted to your settings. otherwise totally a 5 star-worthy app!
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|I was replacing my 20+ year old 12C.  The new one seems lighter, so far seems to work the same.  The only big difference I noticed is that the keys don't seem to have the old feel.  Maybe after a few more weeks I won't notice the difference.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy very much.  the story line is interesting and never dull.  It's an entertaining story.  I would recommended to any one who enjoys romantic novels.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie has some good special effects. The concept of the story is also pretty solid. But the script is pretty weak.
0345803493|5.0|very entertaining.  Loved the story line.  there was never a dull moment in the book; like a great movie you'll want to see over and over again.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is so amazing and excellent it never bores me because its such heart-felt and amazing family movie that touched my heart and is based on an incredible/amazing true story of love,caring amd family<br /><br />OVERALL THIS FILM IS PERFECT  ITS A WINNER
B009JNXK88|1.0|Fun game that is ruined by horrible controls.  Frustrating to say the least.  Will uninstall until the controls are fixed.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I bought this for my Halloween costume and it was nice. I haven't opened the UV pen yet so I don't know how well that works. It looks good but the slider the moves the tip in and out and covers the assembly screw can fall off if bumped. The sound effects will also activate when you slide the end out but I don't think its supposed to.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer is a bit more contrived than the usual Grisham novel but it's still a good read and the twist in the story is still fun. I recommend it
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My significant other heard a friend speaking about this book and was told that he should give it a try.<br /><br />So what did he do? Purchased the Kindle edition for his sick fiance with a lupus flare, with nothing else to do for six days until she was either better or forced from her bed by hospital bureaucrats.<br /><br />I'm so glad that he passed the chance to me first.<br /><br />I have to admit that I am one of the millions that enjoy, \\"The Walking Dead\\" series on television so I didn't mind another zombie read. There are thousands of them available for purchase right now ( I have several) and yet, I feel obligated to delete them all from my Kindle.<br /><br />For the next week, I found myself engrossed into the storyline from the very first page. Yes, anything that can keep my attention going while in pain has some definite talent.<br /><br />As many others have reviewed before me, you're not getting a three or four hundred page novel with a clear beginning, middle, and end. It's a series of interviews of people that survived the \\"War\\" and they are telling their stories for posterity purposes.<br /><br />One may think that the interview style could make the book trudge on and on indefinitely to where the stories seem to overlap but they truly don't! That's what makes this book different from many others. From outer space to the depths of the sea, the story of The War and The Great Panic are covered in detail from the ones that had the skills, the bravery, or just sheer and crazy luck to make it through to the end.<br /><br />There were times that I found myself having to put the book down for SANITY reasons. Yes...my sanity. The imagery and the characters were just too real and convincing. So much so that the moan.....the indescribable and inescapable moan of the living dead when they were upon you literally kept me peering out of the windows and the small caliber handgun by my bedside loaded.<br /><br />You couldn't help but immerse yourself in the stories told by each survivor in their own little way without wondering just what you would have done in that situation. Would you have been among the living? Or one of the millions of tormenters that threatened humanity's existence?<br /><br />World War Z is one of those books that you just can't seem to forget. It will stay at the back of your mind as the current times show that our interest in the living dead won't end anytime soon.<br /><br /> It was brilliantly written and highly recommended.told by each survivor in their own little way without wondering just what you would have done in that situation.

B009AY04A8|3.0|This game is okay but could be better. The graphics arevery nice but there is more dialog than game play. I would love for some of the conversations had in the game to be replaced with actual gameplay. Other than that, it's a very good game!!!
B000FC1HBY|2.0|The original Game of Thrones was a great book.  A good plot with lots of intrigue.  For some reason the author must have thought if he added lots of filthy descriptive sex it would improve the book.  It didn't.  Also,the plot was so spread out it was a little hard to follow. If it wasn't for the gratuitous sex I might have bought more of the series.  I'm not going to.<br /><br />The second half of this book was not so filthy as the first half.  I did in fact buy the third in the series and will see how it goes.  So far it has not been bad.  Will review it when done.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Lots of action and a decent story. Not your average vampire movie, but will keep you watching. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Like all the previous Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus novels, this one did not disappoint me either! Agreed, this series is written for teenagers, but us tweens can also enjoy them. I especially enjoy how the author finds the more obscure myths of Greek mythology and turn them into something novel and funny. All in all, a good bed time read. I am waiting for the next one...
159562015X|1.0|I was excited to read the book and take the assessment. Unfortunately I had multiple issues with getting the code to work. I was so excited to learn from this book that I was willing to buy another code separately but was told by the support team that they don't sell them apart from the book. After doing more research, I found that you only get your top 5 results and not all 34. Essentially, you're not buying the book but the access code; the book is only a reference guide for when you get your top 5 back. If you buy this then good luck on getting a code that works, or else you're left with having to buy it again.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This should be required reading for every American. There are many sacrifices being made for us that we never hear about. The book is a excellent read and brought many tears to my eyes. Americans should  be grateful  to every  man and women who serve .
B005PK56TA|4.0|If you are a fan of Amityville style horror, this is a must have! A little unusual at times but thoroughly entertaining.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|this I heard a lot about this app and its great but I cant download it can someone help? p.s. I axed this because I needed more words
B00433SVP6|5.0|This book certainly had great expectations, coming from Riordan with his Percy Jackson and Kane Chronicles books and it certainly goes over the top!<br /><br />This time, the plot is more richly created adding the fact that Riordan added a Roman aspect to the concept and thus made the story more interesting. Also, the characters were more richly designed and I especially liked Leo, he seemed realistic.<br /><br />The storyline was not good enough considering the wide and interesting plot but considering it had enough action sequences and more-than-enough suspense to keep me glued, I liked it. (I also kept aside the fact that it was very predictable), bit all-in-all, an amazing read!!!<br /><br />Rating: 9.5 / 10
B00005AXKF|3.0|It is in ok shape.  Not too many scratches.  A little beat up, but must have been well loved.  Maybe not charge as much in the future for items a little worse for ware.
1400069289|3.0|For those of you looking to make changes in your life, be aware--this book is more of a collection of anecdotes than a how-to guide for making good habits. Many of the examples cited have a kind of pat assertion that they all follow a consistent stimulus-response pattern. But when you look closer, you can't help feeling that the author has shoe-horned the example into his habits model.<br /><br />Making new activities into little rituals does improve their adoption and consistency, but this book has a very roundabout way of making this point. The Target discussion is a bit smug. Again, it's more than a New Yorker or Businessweek article, but less than a how-to. Borrow it rather than buy it, if you can.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Once past the numerous chapters of minor detail the story became exciting creating an atmoshere of not wanting to put it down.
B000UGS97U|5.0|I bought this for a friend for Christmas, I think she will love it, she loves wookies, haha. It's very cute, thank you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|So many versions including the sound track!  Love the movie and this deal.  I highly recommend this version of Avengers.

B000UD08HW|5.0|My favorite guitar player and one of his best, if not the best, concert he's ever done in his solo career.  This is a must buy
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I never was a fan of star wars (at all), but I am a fan of angry birds. so after watching a few videos for it I finally bought it. It was totally worth it with new powers like light savers, lasers,  and even the force its a really cool.and fun game.There is also new pigs based of star wars villians and the new star wars themes obsticals.  There is one problem though, after paying 2.99 for the first 2 worlds u have to pay another 1.99 if u want the path of the Jeri package. That's a total rip off!!!!!  I could understand that in a free version ( which they don't offer for the kindle fire) but in the $3 version seriously ripping people off. Rovio should offer it for free on the HD version for people who already paid.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is very addicting. I loved all the puzzles and wish they would release more levels to this game and aqua router
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This was absolutely fabulous!  I definitely snorted a lot during the movie (grown adult here)--it was cute and funny at the same time, and I really enjoyed it.  Great animation!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great book! I recommend reading it slowly. I couldn't put the book down after I passed the 1st few chapters, enjoy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is epic! You can do whatever you want! But I don't like the price. So you could go to 4shared.com and you can get this free!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best of this type of book l have read .  Can not wait for the next one.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I enjoyed the books very much. You have to be prepared for the change of story lines. Like an old cliff hanging movie. But once you are in it you can not wAIT xfor the next part.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved this book. I have just bought the second one now. Reading the book has made the movie make more sense. I would recommend you to read it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Came across this free app and decided to install. It is a bit difficult to go thru each level but if you go on the internet and check out badpiggiescheats it shows you thru you tube how to set it up in order to get to the next level.
B007F5S1F4|5.0|the album \\"louder than bombs\\" is a good compilation of the Smith's work in general, though if you want to listen to all their greatest work you must buy the albums. I bought this album in order to collect all of their albums, and am very happy to now have some of the music that you just can't get with other albums. Yes, buy it and enjoy it. Please, Please, Please let me get what I want is on this album, and it sounds great....enjoy
B007KX6U7W|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes from the season. Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore continues to heat up the screen, as women and girls of every age get  sucked into his dreamy blue eyes along with the characters he seduces. A must-see for every vampire fanatic!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow! Loved this book! I usually hate books where there is instant love. Instant attraction, yes, but not instant love. Rest assured for those of you who are like me, the drama soon begins and it becomes heated.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already left enough details I'm sure, but I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book. So much substance. The poetry the author incorporates to convey feelings is amazing. I laughed at the Chuck Norris jokes, cried for Eddie, and stayed up very late to see how the romance panned out. Well done!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't say enough about this app. it is so fun.  Every thing runs well for me on my Kindle Fire and Android phone. Easy to use.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|First off, this is NOT a \\"bubble-popper\\" game.  Believe me, i hate those!  I already played bejeweled when facebook was new, and that was it for me.  This is about patterns and figuring out how to clear the board utilizing new criteria for how you're allowed to do so with each higher level.  The story/dialogue has always seemed odd and fairly extraneous to me.  But i have played through this game about 4 times, each on a different device.  It is flawless.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This was one of the best seasons yet. The behind the scenes stuff, deleted scenes, and bloopers were all excellent. Looking forward to buying season 8!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Before you buy this game, there are somethings you should know, below is a list of things that are missing/altered from the original pc/mac game.<br />1. The World is only 256x256 block long, incredibly short and can be explored within 5 minutes.<br />2. Potions, Enchantment Table, Endermen, Slimes, Pumpkins, Melons, Carrots, Potato's, Emerald, Villages, The Nether, The End, Armor: All these are absent from the game as of 11/11/12, It may be updated in the future, but I am not sure.<br /><br />My thoughts on the game: The game is fun, giving you options to play in creative or survival, but weird changes of the game make it feel like a sloppy port. Below is a list of what I found odd while playing.<br />1.There is redstone in Minecraft, but upon breaking it, no redstone orbs drop out; redstone mechanics are not you implemented in the game.<br />2. You can use TnT in survival, but you can only place it in creative; you can't blow things up in creative mode.<br />3. You can't you smooth stone in creative mode.<br />4. There is no armor, so there is very little use for iron and diamond except for making tools.<br /><br />It's these little things that make it feel like a lazy port, I'd give the game a couple more months as Mojang has promised to bring some of the missing items into the game. But the game currently has a hard time justifying the rather high price of seven dollars.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please leave them in the comment section of this review and I'll be happy to answer them.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Its fun and enertaining but one problem, when ever i move my farm, the sceen turns all blue. So thats annoying. But other than that, its pretty fun.
B008ENA74E|3.0|The story of this guy's career at Goldman Sachs and how through his eyes, their priorities changed over the course of the time he was there. I found this book to be very mildly entertaining but really nothing special in my opinion. Not much else to say. I wouldn't read it again and having read it I would recommend finding something more worth your time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is really fun. On my Kindle Fire it works PERFECLY. No Problems. So i am very happy that there is a fun game in the amazon app store!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I like working on Lego sets from time to time as a way to decompress after work. This set was a lot of fun to put together as it has over 1,300 pieces. I now have this sitting on my shelf and it gets a lot of compliments from anyone stopping by.<br /><br />Towards the end I noticed that a couple of pieces were missing. I was very careful not to drop any of the tiny pieces while removing them from the package so I know it was not me. I went on to the lego website and selected the 2 pieces I was missing. They sent me an email apologizing and shipped me the 2 pieces directly from there facility in Denmark at no cost. What amazing customer service!!!!!!
0785163174|5.0|I was surprised to see the low rating for this, I thought it was a solid A-. I liked how the entire sequence of \\"events\\" are tied together here, from Avengers Dissembled years ago to X-Sanction. This seems to me to be a very difficult accomplishment, you have different writers tying together a lot of different events and characters. This whole thing could've been a huge mess, but it was handled well enough to stand on its own.<br />I also thought that a few of the complaints made about heroes acting out of character were a bit unfair, at least some of those scenes the character's actions are more fully explained/make more sense when you see what happened to them in previous titles. At least to me.<br />  The art is mostly good, and the book itself is high quality. It could have a sturdier binding, though<br />One complaint I have is here is that there is no attempt to put the issues in order of when they happened. So reading this straight through feels like watching Pulp Fiction, everything is mixed up. I've never been a fan of Marvel's tendency to do this in editions of this size. It seems like this type of plot devise might be a good idea, if it can be done right, but the awkwardness in execution always ends up making for weaker and less focused storytelling.<br />If you are planning on keeping up with the Marvel books, reading this is kind of a requirement, there is a lot of fallout continuity wise here.<br />All in all, I liked this event, I thought it blew Fear Itself away.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Great File Manager for Android. Unlike several others I tried, this file manager is both powerful and intuitive. I use it on both my phone and tablet. It even connects to your Google cloud drive and home network to easily move files between them.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Great interface on this app as everybody said especially as FAOTD... but here are a few bugs that I had so far<br />1. If you do not wish to sync with gtasks, the app will keep adding and repeating the default three lists. The only way I got rid of this was to accept then not proceed.<br />2. Nesting does not work<br />3. You cannot set an end date for a recurring task, it will keep repeating forever
0451232852|3.0|I have read a lot lately about this period of time.  Not sure why, it just happened that way.  A Dance to Music of Time was even longer (and also enjoyable.) This one was highly informative.  It put things in perspective in a broad way, with a story and characters that made the information meaningful.  That is my test of historical novels.  Do they help explain the events and fabric of the time.  This one passes that test.  Was it a thriller? No.  Was it fast-paced and have a surprise ending?  Hardly.  Was it long.  OH YES!  I enjoyed it enough to look forward to the next one.  I even re-red the end to get me ready for the next one.  (I can't always remember everything a couple of years later.)
B00863DOL0|5.0|Wonderful DVD from the band's live show in York, England.  Anyone who has heard Blackmore's Night will already own this DVD, which is the latest in their DVD offerings, and features music from their previous 2 CDs.  For those who haven't heard the band yet, this DVD will show you what has hooked the fans and keeps them coming back for more and more and more.  Beautiful vocals, incredible instrumentation, witty, fun banter among the members. Pour some mead, sit back, and you will absolutely enjoy your Blackmore Night experience. And, after you fall under the enchantment of the band, you can grab the CD - all the music from the DVD.
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|a classic masterpiece from a legendary director presented in a a great transfer and beautifully packaged.<br /><br />what else could i ask for :)
B00863CMZE|5.0|An excellent live CD representing tracks from their two previous CDs.  Especially  enjoyable is the different arrangements from those on the studio versions of the songs.  Anyone who enjoys unique, fun, excellently played music has to have this CD in their musical library. And, even more special is the DVD version of \\"A Knight In York\\"...wow!!!  As close to the fun of the live concert as one can get without actually traveling to York.
B001EBWITA|5.0|It was better than I thought it was going to be. Keanu reeves is awesome. I am going to watch it again bc dealing with devils and angels is always a second take.
B0086700CM|5.0|My 6 year old son is obsessed with this game! I don't really understand how it works with different levels but he seems to enjoy it on his kindle fire!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it was ok not great but ok I like this type of game and I play it often so yeah
1451638450|2.0|It's always sad when an author stops working and starts harvesting what they can from what they've done in times before. \\"Dividend Writing.\\"  The author gets tired, the publisher insistent and the results.. is not much to write home about.  The fire's banked, the sun is setting, and it's time to eat the bounty because after a long season I think Ms. Bujold's hungry days of writing are drawing to a close.<br /><br />I have all of Ms. Bujold's Miles books on both Kindle and Nook -- and most of them in hardback as well.  In my occupation hopeless situations abound under crushing pressures -- and Miles helps me THINK -- or at least helps keep me awake in long watches in thrown together control rooms in God Forsaken places.  If he can pull it together, maybe I can as well.  Miles belongs where I can get my mind around him when I need to....<br /><br />Captain Vorpatril is a nice guy.  I see people like him every day.  But I don't invite them into my all too infrequent down time, and I CERTAINLY wouldn't want to relax with him.  Actually I really wouldn't want him anywhere near anything critical in ANY control room. Kindle included.  One has to wonder about IMSEC OPS people who don't take RUDIMENTARY security precautions of ANY KIND when dealing with nefarious kidnappers and slavers while tunneling UNDER THE NOSE of the most paranoid security people in known space? As Miles has often noted, Ivan is an IDIOT!!!!<br /><br />Ms. Bujold phoned this one in.  It's LAZY!!!  I look at the really STIMULATING conversations that didn't happen because they would have been WORK to write (if they didn't write themselves!) The book REVERBERATES with the words not said that SHOULD have been said!!!  The character were THERE with the right problems!!!  The concepts were THERE ITCHING to ignite!! The book is a squib.  Like the bomb.<br /><br />What did The Emperor SAY to Illyan?  What did Lady Alys SAY to the Haut Ghem??  What did the nameless Ensign deep in the bowels of IMPSEC SAY to hisoverwrought boss when a 35 year late bomb detonated during the tunnel fight that should have NEVER happened.  \\"Uh.. sir?  I think we're sinking...?\\"  Rather like the book.  Up to it's roof.<br /><br />No wonder Tej's Jackson Whole house fell!  I just hope Ivan doesn't bring down the entire Vorkosigan universe as well!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I'm very pleased to have purchased this box set of Seasons 1 & 2 of Downtown Abbey. The acting, writing,costumes, and setting are all superb. I can only hope that one day I will be able to travel to Great Britain to see Highclere Castle in person. Until then, I have my BluRays!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Fast paced and thought provoking. The first book is by far the better however the sequels are must reads and don't disappoint.<br />Shame the author is no longer with us as would love to read a fourth.<br />Time to watch the movie now, hope it does the books justice.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The Time Keeper is a pleasant little book that begins softly , rises to a modicum of interest and then fades away.  It never gets exciting nor terribly interesting but it is not offensive nor troublesome. The plot is unique as it has never been written about before but quite predictable in its simplicity. Were I the author's literature prof I would have suggested putting some \\"guts\\" into the story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|No matter what catagory there is something for everyone- it can be addictive and can give you great ideas for parties, decorations your home, to dealing with your sexuality- it's a one stop shop- try it!!!
0062124293|5.0|Reading How To Be a Woman is like having a friend who tells you everything important in her life with humor, detail and honesty.  It was a very enjoyable and insightful read for this 35 year-old still trying to figure out this crazy world.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The solitaisre app is an addictive game, and not to mention a great way to pass the time.  I simply can't put it down!
B00785P2QC|3.0|it's basically a facebook type game. There's energy limits facebook style quests. plus actual facebook features. They want to like their page they have coins and cash in game money. It's not a bad game just not very original.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, however, it is not so much about her experiences on the trail, but the internal battle she is experiencing with her mother.  I would have liked to know more about the hiking and trail experiences.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Ho hum. A rather long winded version of the \\"Story of O\\" which was written decades ago. Every chapter describes the sexual encounters between an \\"innocent\\" young woman and a older super rich, older, Adonis , in gratuitous detail. The man is a Mr Grey who forces this young woman to  perform all kinds of sexual acts including bondage. He apparently was abused as a child and now has fifty shades or layers to his personality. The book has no literary merit.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|\\"The Racketeer\\" was nothing like I thought it would be. Grisham did a completely different type of suspensful book and reluctantly, I got to the end and thought....\\"WOW!\\"  Really?  Good book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever!!! I'm in love!! once you get into it its the best game everyone will love it!!! promise
B004UXUUDA|3.0|I was completely taken with the book and looked forward to the movie but found if I had not read the book I would not have liked the movie. It was hard to follow.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Informative and fun for a large group.  Way too many rating requirements and restrictive , will not use rating tool again
B008OOYALE|5.0|turned out to be more fun than I thought. I tell everyone I know that they need to give this game a try.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good source of current weather conditions, too many requirements for the rating criteria, feel like I have a second job for someone else's benefit
B000HL0JHQ|4.0|This is only the second MacGyver episode Ive seen. I was always under the impression that MacGyver was a clever problem solver. But does anyone really believe that you can patch a hole in a hot air balloon by putting a map on the outside of the balloon and secure it with only 4 pieces of tape attatched  only on the corners  of the map? But ,he redeemed himself by falling in love with Robin Curtis. And who wouldn't!! Robin Curtis performance is outstanding.
0385344333|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a big Jack Reacher fan.I purchased this one with great anticipation just like always. I am disappointed to say that this novel is a letdown in every sense of the word. Like other reviewers have said, too much driving. The Reacher novels have always been talky, but there is nothing but talk. When we get to the climax at the end, we don't care what the problem is. I own all the Reacher books and have read them all more than once, but this one gets sold. Come on Lee, action is what we read these books for!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game ! just wish you could get more heart's . need to fix that.  the graphics are good too!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Recommend to anyone that has a tough stomach and is light hearted towards self abuse.  It could help you to hate ikea if you didn't already. It doesn't matter if you seen the  movie or not, its great on his own standing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it needs more blocks the app is great but it needs portals minecarts rails powered rails and structures and water buckets and lava buckets
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game I have ever played all it needs now are buckets mine carts and the sky portal
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this game is such fun. you should definantly get it. you would have a lot of fun with it. I know I do.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Thoroughly good read regardless of age group let's hope the film stays as true to this book as the first one did.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|A good HD conversion all around, and a great deal. I would recommend this for those looking to upgrade they're library.
0399157565|5.0|Great read as always. Only problem, now I have to wait a year for the next book. Have read all 20 Scarpetta books. Thought killer was a different person. Shocking ending as always. Thank, Patricia.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I loved this. I started off watching the show first so this was different. It was faster and maybe not as deep as I thought but for my first comic it was perfect.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|Our bookclub read this book last month. All of us enjoyed the book and have recommended it to many other people. I personallly  have loaned my copy to three different people. I thought  it was well written. The characters were very well developed and the story held my attention.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I think that this app is one of the smartest ideas in the world. Just having your &quot;brain Barf&quot; be on anything, smartphone, Pc, Mac,ipod,kindle.... the capablilty to be able to write anything in your head, notes for an upcoming quiz, notes for a future book or painting. anything you want to remember. you could use it for a journal too if you wanted to! if you like these things, I reccomend you try out a login and ssee what its like. I further reccomend you use the PC or Mac app to get the full experience. the Evernote for mobile devices mainly does not give you as many options.
B001PPGAJY|5.0|My family love movies that have some type of action hero.  This movie has proven to stand on its own with that.  The characters are fast paced and not boring.  The humor is well received and it brings a nice mix to the fast pace action.  We did not find it gross with gore and truly was entertaining.  Glad we purchased it for our home collection!
B005M2V2K8|5.0|This product was better than what I was expecting!<br />It is so smooth and silky! It looks way better in person!<br />Great product!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book had me in so many emotions, from laughing, upset, Crying, laughing. This was a really good read from start to finish. Will and Layken are just perfect for each other in so many ways, but of course there had to be obstacles. Don't want to spoil it, but believe me this was a really Awesome book,can't wait to read book 2!!
0451232852|5.0|i found the book engaging,informative,great character development, well worth the price for the hours of enjoyment.  i look forward to the next installment
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book really spells out the mission of the special forces in general not just in the mission that killed Osama.
0547564651|5.0|Wow -- I have just finished living with your book in my ear -- literally listening to it for 2 weeks as I exercised, cooked, drove, and parented.  It answered so many of my questions about my own success and sometimes lack thereof and helped me to think more fully about how I parent my 6 year old boy.<br /><br />THANK GOODNESS -- I am a high licking Dam :) !!!  When you said you don't lick Ellington -- I smiled on the treadmill.  I don't lick my son -- but I do pet him, and touch him, and hold him, and ruffle his hair -- and he asks to be cuddled and I try to always put the laptop of work away so  I can.<br /><br />I have always said my Mom was the greatest because she knew enough to know she had to let me fall out of some trees (not tall ones)-- and I did and that I need to be that mom.  And you wrote about how you and your wife struggled with that and learned how.<br /><br />I found this book extraordinary !!!  It was amazing to me that I was hearing these things for the first time.  I had a fantastic education and I attribute my business success to that education, but this book helped me to answer some questions I has about why some people with the same education went one way and others -- another.  The information about Grit and Optimism and Self-discipline is BAR NONE !!<br /><br />Please READ THIS BOOK and help us to fix our country !!!!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I couldn't put the book down but I haven't been subjected to such terrible profanity since I was in the army.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Captivating....the wrapup was perfect...looking forward to Season 3.  It's been a long time since a show captured my interest in this way....watched the whole series in two days...this is from someone who would usually prefer to read a book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|one of my favorite apps out there!  challenging trying to breed special dragons but fun!  Takes some time to get money flowing when not buying gold with your real money but all together a great app.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its fun but starts a little slow for me this plays differently from Virtual City but uses a lot of the same concepts. enjoying it so far!
B001TW68P4|5.0|the turtles CD arrived in good time. It was in great shape. I have enjoyed listening to it. I'll buy more.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|This all centers on a cube that holds this vast unlimited power that powermongers of the universe seems to want control of and are willing to destroy the earth to get...<br /><br />Um, I kept expecting all the cars and other hardware to transform into living metalic organisms called transformers and deceptacons.<br /><br />The only thing different between the two sets of films seems to be the surrounding characters....<br /><br />If this is the original Avengers storyline, then maybe the Transformers people stole the cube idea.<br /><br />The Avengers bogs down  in the late beginning as it tries to slowly bring everyone of the heros together from where ever they are. Only once they are a team does the movie start taking on its cohesiveness.<br /><br />So now that we have the beginning tale, the next movie should be better from start to finish -- Right?
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This creator of this show is a genius. I love to watch directors who have balls to step out of ordinary and bring to life a real story with really great actors. I have been following this show and must say it like \\" What to do when diaster hits bootcamp ?\\". Especially with government playing around with warfare agents which we think are common things ..colds. etc that are slowly killing us.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  It was a real winner.  The horse was my favorite character. A very nice take on the fairy tale.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i like this app very much.  keeps my well advised of the weather conditions in my part of the world and where i'm going.  this is a very good app.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|FB is a great way of connecting with friends who you don't see often or haven't seen in a long time.  However, it can be very frustrating at times.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|Ok, not something I'd let anyone under 18 watch too many nude scenes , not very realistic for the time
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use The Weather Channel quite often.......particularly when going on a trip...I use the 10 day area part of the channel.  It's also helpful when having company for a length of time.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was almost as great as The Dark Knight even most people knew that it wasn't quite going to hold a stick to the last film but it was worth it. Batman\ Bruce Wayne faces a new challenge that he gets called out of absence after eight years when Selena Kyle (nut she's not called Catwoman) robs  him and somehow becomes a formable ally to take on the terrorist Bane that comes to Gothin City to create extreme havok not only for Batman\Bruce but for everybody in between but can he rise to the occasion and save millions of lives? One of the final films in a series since Toy Story 3 and it made the Batmab film worldwide and overseas that in total it made more than the last Batman film and held on better despite opening and violence errupted in Colorado during the midnight screening of the film that it would has destroyed the film completely but surprising held on strongly till now at $447 million and counting and Tom Hardy rules as Bane that he's an hundred times better than the infamous Batman and Robin's Bane and it also made more overseas than domestic that TDKR was the last bright spot movie of Summer 2012 and after that no other film not even came close of making real money and now will on blu-ray with the Imax 72 minute footage that was shot in the format and on dvd with the non-Imax shot format footage that was seen in theatres.
0446530573|2.0|Lots of great recipes and some funny stuff too! Obviously not for anyone who fancies themselves \\"the next great chef\\" or has delusions of granduer concerning their culinary skills. Not even for people who remember how their mom or grandmother USED TO make food. Just a good fun book for Soprano's fans that might wanna throw some food on the stove<br /><br />The only issue I had with this book was the fact that a section of pages repeated and some pages were not there. Obviously a pressing issue, would be classified as defective or a second.<br /><br />Otherwise the book was great... but it only deserves a 2 since it's not a complete book.<br /><br />Seller offered to replace with a book of slightly lesser quality, but I didn't feel it was worth the effort. more than enough recipes to make the book worthwhile
0061692042|2.0|This is my first book by Richard Ford and with the glowing reviews I was expecting great things. I found it a grim, grey, plodding novel which was extremely hard to get through. I did finish it, out of curiosity because of the good things said about the author, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B0051UH6W4|4.0|Beautifully written and refreshingly different.  The writing was very visual with characters that stay with you long after you've finished the book.  For people who love prose.
0525953728|4.0|The men of the Seal Teams live a life that is very different from most of us. They are on the point of the spear and we should be glad they are on our side. The book makes plain the dedication and motivation of those who choose and can qualify for this life. The account of the OSB raid is riveting and an edge of your seat read for anyone interested in these kinds of things. I'm not sure of the prudence or security issues of writing this book, but it's done and there it is. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in military affairs. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to have some of the bad guys read it as well!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was very enlightening  From a neosurgeons point of view it proved that NDE is not from a function of the brain. In parts of the book , I thought it was too involved for a lay person to understand. Guess I was wanting a more personal viewpoint instead of such a technical  view.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille has spun a believable tale about evil people in a part of the world he makes very real to readers.  His hero John Corey is funny, perceptive, and someone you instinctively like.  This is a good read that makes you smile at times and hold onto your chair at other times.  As someone who is a longtime DeMille fan, this book is a great addition to his work.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I love having my yahoo on my Kindle it is very user friendly. Easy to follow icons and large print make it worth getting.
B0086700CM|5.0|Works fine on the Kindle Fire. Only a very slight lag and an occasional force-close, but that doesn't happen very often, so I still rate it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I kinds like it but one time I accidentally deleted it then I wanted to get it again then it wouldn't let me get it again.
B008VBYN80|5.0|you can spend time just setting up your kingdom. This is very exciting and sometimes exhilarating.  Take your time and see how far you can go.
0446547646|5.0|This novel is by far his best. The plot, romance, and action all contributed greatly. Novel is honestly better than the Notebook because it has a real story, and real plot. The love in the novel is that of a real, true, first love. Definitely a keeper.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|Fear with Mark Walburg is a great movie with a lot of action scenes. This is one of his better movies we have seen. I would recommend it to anyone that like him in an action movie.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its good and addicting but every 2 seconds I go off the game it deletes my progress and leaves the world looking like I never touched it. I'm annoyed. I did not pay $ 7 for that:-(.  save your money. that's ridiculous.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Product:<br />I am writing this review as I am listening to the cd. Truly an amazing artist. The songs are beautiful and quite relaxing. I recommend looking up the videos. They are really inspirational and awesome.<br /><br />*Shipping:<br />Came several days early from expected arrival date. Package and materials were in perfect condition.
0062511408|4.0|It's like a fairy tale and I do not particularly like the genre but it is well written and it makes you reflect on its several second meanings. The writer shows his mastery in dealing with the language and he is capable of evoking fascinating atmosphere.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I loved this book it has you gripped from the beginning best of the three in my opinion. Great read :-D
0345803485|3.0|Imagine Prince charming taking you to dinner by helicopter, anticipating your desires and taking troubles to protect you and then asking you to sign a contract to allow sadomasochistic sexual behavior on his part. Can it be true to life?
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't read it fast enough :-@ what a cliff hanger ending making you want to start the second book straight away
0062073486|4.0|If you like thrillers, Agatha Christie will never disappoint you. This novel is well written, the plot is complex and skillfully developed and, in the end, there is a logical answer to the many questions you cannot but ask yourself while reading. Magic and the supernatural are left out and this makes the novel even more fascinating.
B00005R6XJ|5.0|wonderful product. one of my absolute favorite movies and i recommend it to everyone. make sure you are fluent in french if you buy this version. more importantly, make sure you have a special dvd player that can play foreign dvds. if you don't, you can change the region on your computer. some computers only let you change the region a limited number of times, but i think you can purchase software that overcomes this. but again, see this movie. it will change your life!
B004132HZS|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is superb as a modern Sherlock Holmes. He is plays a brilliant, annoying, and persistent narcissist. His portrayal has some threads in common with Jeremy Brett's excellent version of the character, but it is Cumberbatch's own style and it is fabulous.  This rendition of the famous duo of Holmes and Watson includes modern touches, such as the use of cell phones, and light-hearted jokes about the age old question of whether or not Holmes and Watson are gay, etc., which are great fun. Our family watched the episodes as they appeared on TV, and we bought this DVD as a birthday gift for a friend who is a fellow Sherlock Holmes fan. We can't wait for Season Two!
B004SIPA4G|5.0|services : sent faster than ETA;<br />packaging : nice, no damages at all;<br />for me, the quality of the movie is very nice, superb detail, nice sound too.<br />well, i am satisfied with the service and the movie itself. great addition to my collection.<br />thanks amazon :)
B004WJRF6C|5.0|This is an old favourite I had on record and wanted to replace. All good my cd is second hand and in good condition. I would buy from this co again.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|well, from the movie itself i cannot explain a lot, so for anyone who ask about it and fans of ridley scott movie, see for yourself and speak your mind.<br />but for me, it's very nice to watch a brief \\"prequel\\" to understand more of the alien series.... when i watch it, i tought a lot about star wars - beside alien series of course :), but damn i thought it loose some thrill element... well of course, since the director says it's more sci-fi than other alien series, but i think it will be great movie when it have some sequel, so i'll be wait for the sequel to be out some times next year... great job ridley scott!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am in love with 101-in-1 games so much! This is such a fun game and I enjoy it very much. It's a great time waster when you are on a long road trip or in an airplane. I highly recommend this app for those who like to waste some time.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Even though the language can be a challenge for me at times, I've ways loved this book! It is just a classic story that has defiantly withstood time and change!!
B005URRCUY|3.0|A friend of mine suggested the music to me.  So far I am still trying to get used to it.  A little rough around the edges, but what do you expect from a three piece band ?
B00004Z4SD|2.0|I loved this show as a kid.  I was excited to see it finally offered. However, it is a very poor quality set.  The DVDs are not numbered, they are packaged in an odd way that stacks them against each other, there are no special features and worse part of the quality of the recordings. They are faded and sometimes a bit jumpy.  All that beautiful scenery I remember is faded yellow/brown.  Like watching a 20 year old VHS tape.  I would love to see this digitally remastered.  We'll watch them still - but would wait for a better version before buying any other seasons.  I wouldn't recommend this set.

0060873175|2.0|The best Crichton stories put the reader into a time and place they have never thought about, and flesh that world out with mountains of data, images, sights, sounds, and trivia.<br /><br />The Great Train Robbery put the reader in Victorian England. Timeline in the high middle ages. Sphere underwater.  Even Pirate Latitudes, which was a silly, silly story, makes you feel like you're living and breathing in the Caribbean English colony during the romantic age of pirates.  He can't write a female character to save his live but he can write a good story.<br /><br />With Micro, you can see where Crichton was going.  Start with the outline of Jurassic Park, place those characters in an insect's world instead of a dinosaur's, throw in an evil corporation hell-bent on playing in God's domain (a recurring theme in later Crichton books, Pirate Latitudes notwithstanding) and see what happens.<br /><br />And it could have been awesome.<br /><br />I doubt that Crichton would have wanted the story to get published as it did.  As it stands, this is not even a mediocre book, and is all the worse because it could have been one of his best.  Life as a one-inch tall hunk of meat in a rain forest of insect predators is a fascinating concept, as anyone who has watched the movie Microcosmos can attest to (and I suspect that's where he got the idea for this).  I also believe he would have expanded that part of the story beyond just two days (like he did with Timeline) and probably put in more cooperation between the different camps of humans that got shrunk.  The philosophizing about the nature of nature that made it into the story also most likely came directly from Crichton, as it's similar to ideas he brought up in Andromeda Strain and Congo.<br /><br />What got published, however, is awful.  A rush job, probably done as quickly as possible after the rights to the rough draft were secured (or were they just notes?).  Full of typos and grammatical errors.  No imagination whatsoever with the paint-by-the-numbers plot.  And, uniquely among Crichton books, very boring.

0316223239|3.0|Upon reading such rave reviews for Room I was extremely excited to begin reading. However, I couldn't help but feel that certain parts of the book were overdeveloped (Jack and Ma's day to day life in Room) as well as underdeveloped (Ma's relationship with Old Nick). There was a part in the middle where my heart was racing and I absolutely could not put it down, other than that it was a pretty mellow read for me.<br /><br />But I do feel it was wonderfully written  minus the slight inconsistencies in Jack's choice of language.<br /><br />Overall, just a good book. If you're in your house for a day with no where to go - pick it up!
1400079276|5.0|I recommend this book and this writer to anyone who enjoys Kurt Vonnegut's imgaination. (if you enjoyed Jazz Perfume, you'll love Marakami's stories.) If you haven't tried Vonnegut or Murakami, then try them both. You are in for a treat. Haruki-san weaves a tale that allows the extraordinary to seem ordinary and politely challenges ones notions of what is normal. Occasionally erotic, but not distractingly so, Kafka on the Shore leads your mind along a fascinating journey of discovery as seen through the eyes of an adolescent on his first foray into the world alone, and a strange world it is. I am ordering another Murakami book.
086571701X|5.0|This is one of the best how-to books on this subject (or almost any subject) I've ever read.  The concepts are easy to grasp, the instructions are explicit and I can't wait to get started.  My thanks to the author for making this topic clear and \\"digestible\\"!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I heard that Hunger Games had great potential. It may have, but it never clicked.  It was slow, unintersting and reminiscent of the poor quality after school specials of the 80's.<br />Spoiler Alert:<br />The final \\"moral of the story\\" - If you're willing to sell out yourself and everything you believe in, you'll be rich and famous. SAD!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book was very well written from start to finish.  It gives the reader a great perspective of an individual in that position and what it takes to be there.  I wasn't able to put it down once the ill fated mission started.  This is a must read.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|From what Ridley Scott said, this was a movie to stand apart from the Alien series. It wasn't. It was simply a poor  (very poor) restart with good effects and a weak plot.  I like Ridley Scott's other movies (Alien, Blade Runner), but this was just sad. The beginning excited me and the original premise behind it was great, but it never came together.<br />It was a waste of the $2 rental. Save your money and your time - watch soething else.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awsome! There is just one little flaw and the the prices on things can be expenceive to save up for, but over all this game is amazing! It is the better than all of the other games that they made. Get this app
B007BZM3HK|5.0|saw the parody of the song and knew that I had to have the original song. Bright and fun is the name of this song
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Good amazing book. Thought I would have a better ending but now I am eager to get the next installment of the series to see what happens to the heroes of olympus
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I saw this in the movies and then again on Amazon!!!!! I love this movie, I expect at least a part two!
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Terrific acting. Wonderful storyline, with excellent dialogue. This is a movie that will entertain and captivate one's attention right from the start.
0142407542|5.0|As a grandmother of 4 this book is wonderful and it is also a movie, so we read the book and then rent the movie. So much fun!
B00914JWSW|1.0|I can't ever remember listening to more inane songs and senseless music from Miss Barbara ever.  She sings fine but it's the music and her choice of songs on this record that STINK!  I've never played a CD and been so disappointed to the degree I threw it in the trash after our first listen.  Om a scale of 1-10 this should not even have been ranked much less recorded!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Calling Rowling an author is an insult to even the most limited high school senior.  This book is nothing but a \\"passive\\" aggressive attack England and the mddle class.  The women are all crones, the men all disreputable --- there's not one likable character in the whole book, or at least the portion I read.  It's so poorly written, so full of gratituous vulgar terminology and expressions that I couldn't even finish it, so if there is a  character who redeems the rest, it must be smoeone who appears after the first 150 pages...!
B004D2CPO0|4.0|Very good typical Takeshi yakuza genre. I liked it. A bit more basic than the typical twists and turns, but worth watching.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. when I have free time this is the first game that comes to mind.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Bel Ami, starring the Twilight Enterprise's Robert Pattinson, is a film that captures your attention for sure!  'You Beautiful Love' is what you will ultimately need to interpret during and after the viewing.  Try watching it several times as each character really has a deeper-self rather than the straight-on lust vs love sentiments of their persona.  Obtaining Bel Ami from Amazon was a delightful treat as it was delivered in only several says and hassle-free from any problems! Congrats to the author of Bel Ami, the producers & directors if this captivating film, and cheers also to the cast & crew of Bel Ami!
B005FUTBV4|5.0|OK, sorry, trivial title for a review of a very serious movie.<br />Kevin Smith has long been a favorite director of mine- his dialog is often considered his strong suit.<br />Here he directs an ensemble of great actors giving great performances- and Michael Parks is Brilliant.
B008OOYALE|3.0|too many adds. ln fact I am only reviewing it so it will stop asking me to review it every time I. open it. .
B000007492|4.0|There's only a couple of songs that are played over and over on the FM. They are on this CD. And a lot of other songs that, to me, are very forgettable. But the ones I like are there and now I have them
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 7-yr-old loves this game. It is an interesting twist on Angry Birds, which he has been playing for awhile. I tried it out, just to see why he is so addicted to it... In my opinion Bad Piggies is more difficult than Angry Birds, perhaps because it requires a different level of problem-solving from the player. Great game!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Bad title to my review aside, this movie is amazing. Every fan of Joss Whedon's work was rooting for this film and wondering if it would work.<br />It does.<br />The 3D is amazingly good too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|you raise little dragons into strong dragons, there are differnent types of unique dragons. you have 4 different base dragons,  you mate the different dragons to get new combinations. Try it, I bet you will like as much as I do!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|Werner Herzog is a very strange man. He has made many strange films.<br />This one is his most cohesive, patient, and,in many ways, his most beautiful film.<br />The use of 3D is surprising . I saw it in 3D in the theater and the home experience in 3D is even more impressive

B004QOB8SY|5.0|Updating Sherlock Holmes to the 21st Century continues with brilliant acting and equally brilliant writing. Ending again with a cliffhanger that I and my friends still debate...Have to wait until Summer 2013?!? Can't rush genius I guess.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland get's under your skin, you can barely wait for the next show. Intense with a core of reality. Best series of the season.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Mr Hall continues his brilliant portrayal. The changes to the TV show from the novels that inspired it make some of the dynamics difficult but the cast and crew are doing it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very Spooky and a lot of fun. The first season was great and this season is coming out just as strange. I am also glad they kept some of the old cast.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  However, it was not the best this author has writrn. Such books as Plum Island were somewhat better in my opinion.

0316228532|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was great! It was a little slow starting out, but once you learn the characters it really gets interesting. I had trouble putting it down each night and having to wait till the next day to continue reading it. Great book!
B0007CNXUK|1.0|I watched this movie a few years ago and once I reached the part where an actor or actress says the following line, \\"The other day we took to an exploration of darkest Africa in our garden,\\" I returned the movie. So I will give this movie 1 star no matter how much it deals with the imagination. Africa is not a dark continent, not to talk of being the darkest.
B004AQR24W|1.0|One of the worst movies I have seen in the past few years.  I like action flicks, from the Bourne series (Matt Damon version) to The Raid: Redemption, and many others.  This was one of the absolute worst.  Bad acting, lame directing, even the fighting scenes weren't interesting.  I could find no redeeming qualities in this steaming pile of BS...

B007REV4T8|4.0|What \\"SkyFall\\" offers to its audience is Bond, James Bond, as an espionage agent...not as a cardboard character or a flawlessly dressed superhero. Back in the 1950's and 1960's, that's how Bond was imagined by his creator.  Go back to the books - start with Casino Royale or From Russia with Love - and you will see that Bond is a tough, loyal, hard-edged spy.  Daniel Craig brings this kind of Bond back.  Sean Connery was glamorous, Roger Moore was silly, but Daniel Craig acts, moves, and thinks like a spy.<br /><br />And the villain in \\"SkyFall\\" was once an important asset of MI6...perhaps a friend of Bond once.  He is the enemy today because he wants revenge. Why? He was cruelly betrayed by Britain and M when it was expedient for him to get captured and tortured.  He was traded for 6 other British agents. See the film \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" to get an idea how governments will and do make these choices at the personal sacrifice of their agents.  When my father was a spy against the Nazis for the French this was a real fear when he operated in enemy territory. Can you really trust your own side, when you live in the shadows?  And so Raoul Silva (Javier Barden) - the new enemy of MI6 - was born by surviving his betrayal. Governments do create their own Frankensteins.<br /><br />Both the flawed psychological, hurt natures of Bond and Silva are explored in this brilliant thriller. As Judi Dench (as M) puts it, orphans make the best spies.<br /><br />Although there are some extraordinary stunts in the film, gone are most of the spy gadgets that helped Bond get out of trouble.  He has to use his brains, not only his courage, to win this showdown.  I love the part when he goes back into time, and drives his \\"Goldfinger\\" vehicle again.  The gadget that villian Raoul Silva uses, is one we live with everyday - the computer.  For he is an expert in cybercrime.<br /><br />Now we have reached Bond at 50 - Daniel Craig nails it. Although I must confess that this Bondis someone who doesn't smile or enjoy luxury wines - something I miss from the Sean Connery days.
B008JAGZDE|1.0|it was the same jokes from before, but even more so embarrassing to watch this time around. amazon instant quality was good though

B004GGQMRY|5.0|A great film,love every minute of it.Dustin Hoffman always seems to make me smile and laugh through the portrayal of his character.The movie it's self looks great in blu ray,the sound is crystal clear.The menu can be a little difficult to find what your looking for when it comes to the blu ray features but they are indeed there.I had a difficult time trying to find out how to access the special features...The deleted scene was funny! It has Raymond going into a store to get some of his cheese balls as well as an apple juice pack (he eats the cheese balls and drinks the apple juice before he was suppose to pay for it then he gets told by the store clerk that \\"You have to pay for the stuff before you can eat/drink it\\" and then in typical Raymond fashion he accidently bumps over a container of cookies and says \\"UH,OH!\\" Then the store clerk kicked him out before Tom Cruise got there to save his brother.It's a long movie but so worth the money...One of my favourites :)
B005LAIHCM|4.0|It seems like only yesterday that Jennifer Lawrence made her big screen debut in Winters Bone, a small scale but critically acclaimed movie which gained her an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Since then she has gone from strength to strength starring in two of the biggest box office successes we have seen in the last two years X Men First Class and Hunger Games. I think it's fair to say that her rise has been meteoric.<br /><br />As I watched the movie and the camera's love affair with her, the thought went through my mind several times of what an exquisite looking creature she truly is, still young enough to play a teenager.<br /><br />A grisly murder of two parents takes place in a remote house in a leafy suburb of an upscale neighborhood of a typical rural town. The daughter who killed them was never found thus stoking local legend that she is still running around loose.<br /><br />Years later a mother played by Elisabeth Shue and her daughter Elissa (Jennifer) move to said town they end up in a house nearby from which the slightly rundown, seemingly abandoned and spooky murder house is visible. Cue the scary music when Jennifer looks through the trees and sees the house light unexpectedly come on. Wooh.<br /><br />As Elissa adjusts to school life her curiosity ensures familiarity with the story, and then one night walking in the rain a car stops to offer her a ride home, and the driver is the current occupant of the scary house the only surviving member of the family. Does she get in the car or keep walking?<br /><br />Elissa and her mother have one of those fractious relationships and her mother forbids her from having anything to do with the occupant of the house but Elissa is attracted to him and teens will be teens. While she likes this misunderstood boy the town as a whole is understandably suspicious of a boy who would choose to live in the house where his parents were killed. Creepy, right?<br /><br />Not all the horror of the past has been resolved and although Elissa is on the alert things can happen so you can become scared or horrified. What I liked was that this movie did manage to surprise me. This movie may scare you at times and I liked its unusual twists particularly about the daughter.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining and definitely elevated by the star power of Jennifer Lawrence. I think most people will love it and I hope this was helpfulough Elissa is on the alert things can happen so you can become scared or horrified.

0307269760|2.0|Although this book was well written, the stories are sad and depressing. I liked the fact that they contain short stories so one could move on, but every story left me heavy hearted.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app because In sted of buying with gold it tells you what dragons to breed and you get them plus if a friend wants to give you a gift all they can give you is GOLD it is AWESOME!!!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game since it has the dragons. The gold is hard to get unless your friend sends you 1 gold. The gift is 1 gold. So don't worry if ur worrying. This game is only about u having a tiny island and build up on more and more dragons. You have to expand and then you can destroy the stuff in the way witch is really annoying.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It's okay. I liked it. I just thought he would give more of description of the lessons he learned. But it was okay.

B002NNA9N0|5.0|My former office mate would play the scene with Alec Baldwin for all the new hired staff to see how they reacted. Based on this one 5 minute scene I ordered the disc. It was a great movie. Should be mandatory for all new hires. The cast was an incredible line up.
B008OOYALE|4.0|i luv dragons but this is a pretty good app to get bcuz u dont need gems or real money to get other dragons or upgrade.  just keep breedin and u will get all the dragons u couldnt get b4. ive played and i havent spend 1 dime 4 nothin and my place is getting awesome. However the game is ok bcuz i have a pet story app and i like it bettr,  but this app is cool nothin gets spoiled. nothin gets abandon if take too long to collect a dragon. this app is really good. i still dont understand y people use their $ 4 these apps wen u dont need 2. i mean dont complain about prices if ur using ur money 4 these apps. anyway get this app if u havent played pet story b4.
B009VB97EY|1.0|There was no story line or acting in this movie. It was hard to imagine a worst (major) motion picture than Magic Mike.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|There is a lot going on in this movie that you don't realize while you are watching it.  I wish I had had the time to watch it a second time during the timeframe I had rented it.  I will be watching it again!
1416596585|4.0|Levy's In the Plex is a very entertaining book about the development of Google as a company, a lot of the personalities within the firm and some of the technology behind it.  It is a very good read and taught me a lot about one of the most successful companies in the world.  I found the little anecdotes about how people search particularly interesting, particularly how Google studies how people substitute words in searches (e.g. using the word puppy as opposed to dog or finding a recipe by putting in the ingredients).  The book really underscored the important of ad words for Google's business model and had a pleasant discussion about the initial public offering and the very different philosophies of Google from Wall Street.  I would highly recommend this book.
6302477751|5.0|Watched it as a child. Just wish it was on DVD. A pure delight!<br />It is truly a famly film
B008G33PMI|1.0|I had to return this blue ray disc since I could not played it on two different blue ray players. This is a defective disc and other customers are complaining about the same issue. It weems they did not perform quality control before shipping the disc for distribution.

B009VB97EY|2.0|I didn't see the movie in theaters but I heard all the hype and thought it would be worth renting. Boy was I wrong! The plot was horrible!! The dancing wasn't too bad, but I thought there should have been more for a movie about dancing.

B008LSVLVA|5.0|I can not  recommend  \\"Get All You Deserve\\" highly enough!<br />As a concert performance its equal to to any before or after in the landscape of music.<br />The band gives what Steven Wilson wants a moment in space and time  to be heard and seen!<br />While \\"Get All You Deserve\\" gives  a depth to the studio versions of the songs sonically and emotionally.<br />Shows how Steven Wilson keeps the artist in him real while creating his art.<br /> The picture and sound quality (96/24 stereo) of the blu-ray only enhances this experience.(I use a Oppo BD 93 player for music only,  the audio is connect through the HiFi.)<br />What came first the Grace For Drowning(the egg) or Get all You Deserve (the chicken)<br />When \\"'Grace For Drowning \\" came out I bought both the CD and the Blu-ray edition. The  Blu-ray edition was  a visual connection to the album and the 96/24 stereo a slightly warmer  sound over the Cd.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Well done and well acted.  There are too many superfluous sex scenes.  These become less frequent as the story line develops.  The masturbation scene could have been alluded to--a bit too graphic for me.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|fun game but you can only play so far and then must purchase tokens in order to continue. Did not like the chat box in the lower left corner too many people fighting with each other over nothing.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Ms. Rowling, I adore you. Your HP books were just so amazing and have provided me with about 12 years of entertainment. So when I saw you were releasing a new book, I honestly felt I owed it to you to purchase it and try it out, in thanks for the years of enjoyment of your writing. I was truly excited about it. I counted down the days to the release. I in no way expected it to be a Harry Potter-level masterpiece. I did, however, expect your novel to be interesting and enjoyable. I regret to say that, though I go typically through books with enthusiastic fervor, it took me over a month to finish your book. I can finish just about any book in two days flat if I'm enjoying it. I soak up the written word like a very thirsty sponge. But I just could not get into this book. I could not in any way get excited for what would happen next. It seemed to me to be an overall aimless plot, topped off with a sad and dramatic ending that in no way matched the pace of the rest of the book. It was like boringboringboring, then BAM- dramatic, tragic ending. I really cannot understand what possessed you to write it. The petty happenings of small town life simply do not strike me as engaging subject matter. I feel there were too many characters (boring ones, at that). It took me at least until halfway through the book to even differentiate between them all. Overall, this book gave me a sad face :( At the least, I expected an entertaining read. This book was, simply put, a drag that I had to force myself to finish.<br />I also felt your writing was needlessly crude. It was as if you were trying to force your way out of the YA genre by being vulgar (and I am by no means prudish or sensitive), and it honestly added nothing to your book. Why, though? You're such a great writer!<br />I can forgive your mistake in writing this novel, though lol. I loved your other books so much that it more than makes up for this horrid flop. Just please don't do it again! :(<br />And let me make it clear that it pains me to have to write this kind of review for you. The book just was not good, love. I very much regret having to write this! But I had to be honest about my review.<br /><br />P.S. This book was far too overpriced. Yes, Ms. Rowling's name carries much prestige ... but this book was not worthy of the price tag by a long shot.t it pains me to have to write this kind of review for you.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book<br />After the dark days ,the capitol decides to start the hunger games to remind the people of the districts (12 in all) that they are above them .<br />The hunger games involve 24 kids (1 boy,1 girl) from all the districts .<br /> Kat is a girl from district 12 or the coal mines and is the tribute from this district who has an advantage because she hunts to keep her family alive.The other tribute is peeta.<br />Peeta pulls a stunt to keep himself and kat alive and kat goes along with it to survive but only towards the end she gets to know that the stunt is reality but by then the damage is already done<br />The ending of this book is quite surprising but well thought and is is also the beginning of the uprising .<br /><br />Book 3<br />This book is personally a very depressing book<br />Kat has a breakdown twice<br />The first when she gets to know about preetas whereabouts and the second is towards the end when she loses a lot of things close to her heart<br />She realises the cost of being the mockingbird<br />But the only thing in the book the book that was disappointing was the end<br />Personally it was not apt<br />Warning : certain parts in the third book might get you depressed

B0088EDMMS|5.0|This is an old childhood favorite that I just had to have once more so I can watch it whenever I want. It's a great movie, and there are definitely additional things I picked up on as an adult than I remembered as a kid which kept it entertaining for me as well.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have to say, that  I myself must be a masochist, because I put myself through the torture of reading all three books in this god-awful series.  I just cant wrap my tiny little brain around why the author made three books.  The first book was mildly amusing.  I  thought, ok, this is a good ending point.  Nope, two more books.  I read.  the next book thinking, oh what the hell, maybe it gets better.  Nope, it got worse.  The inner goddess.  The way they call each other \\"Mr. and Mrs.Grey\\"  ...  The jealousy.  The psycho controlling behavior of Christian Grey with his stupid pants that \\"hang off his hips\\". Does she have to say \\"oh my\\" ten million times in these books?<br />I have never ready a more repetetive book.  Why I decided to read all three is beyond me.  Even the sex scenes made me want to digitally slap them both through my kindle.  I'm at 82% finished with the third book, and the plot has gone nowhere.  I needed to take a break to vent.  I will continue with my thoughts after I finish.....

0812992784|4.0|Just as Gregor Samsa found himself turned into a bug one fine morning in Franz Kafka's  'Metamorphosis', Salman Rushdie  finds himself sentenced to death on Valentine's day, 1989 by an Iranian Ayatollah's 'Fatwa'. This book, though an autobiography, primarily  deals with the horrendous ten years from 1989 onwards  as he lived  like a fugitive, evading assassination by the Islamic extremists. Adopting the pseudonym 'Joseph Anton', he is constantly on the move, protected by the Special Branch of Police. He is forced to trade privacy, freedom and choice in return for security. Though overwhelmed and in despair during the early years of such 'confinement', Salman Rushdie heroically fights back gradually to continue working on his books, falling in love and out of it, be a father, lover and a successful author. His chronicle of those ten years is a story of his battle for the freedom of speech and for the freedom of Art to express itself fearlessly. This memoir is at once evocative, honest and very heart-warming.<br /><br />The years under 'protection' was a mixed bag. On the one hand, Rushdie is immensely thankful to the splendid policemen who protected him round the clock . He is grateful to his friends in the literary and publishing world, who formed a 'ring of security' around him so that he could continue to live as normal a life as was possible. He is grateful to the Labor party govt which eventually gave him back his freedom. On the other hand, the upper echelons of the British Conservative Party, the Tory  govt, Scotland Yard and parts of the media like 'The Independent' had little sympathy for him and felt that he wasn't worth the money and effort expended in protecting him. They thought that he brought it on himself and should face the consequences. One senior officer in the Special Branch of Police told Rushdie that he hadn't served the nation the way other VIPs had done,  for whom such levels of protection is provided. Even the Christian church in the UK attacked him for hurting the sentiments of the Faithful. The antipathy of the Tories may be due to Salman being a lifelong Laborite but it is also possible  that race played a negative role here because it is hard to imagine similar lack of empathy to a writer like Martin Amis or Christopher Hitchens or Graham Greene. Finally, it was the Labor govt's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Derek  Fatchett who worked extremely hard with Iran to nullify the fatwa and give him back his freedom.<br /><br />What was Salman's Rushdie's 'crime'? It is appropriate here to recount the reasons for the fatwa of death on him. Rushdie , as an irreligious man and an atheist, says about the Prophet's Revelations: \\" ..a revealed text should be scrutinised like any other text, using all the tools of the critic, literary, historical, psychological, linguistic and sociological. In short, the text should be regarded as a human artefact and like all such artefacts, prey to human fallibility and imperfection\\". From this viewpoint, he goes on to analyse the early pronouncements of polytheism by the Prophet to the later switch to monotheism as expounded in the Quran. From what I understand, it is this approach based on recorded history and social context that has landed him in such major strife, some 1400 years after the Revelations. One can even understand the Ayatollah being outraged. But why should  British liberals and  the Left too? After all, this approach is rational and the Left believes in it as much as Rushdie does!<br /><br />The one really tragic event of the `fatwa years' for Rushdie was his apology to the Islamic fundamentalists for hurting their feelings.  The continuous stress of living under a `death threat' gets the better of him and he decides in a moment of despair and confusion,  to meet with some Egyptian clerics in London to negotiate the lifting of the `fatwa' by expressing regret for his action. He writes an apology to Ali Khameini of Iran regretting \\"profoundly the distressthe publication has occasioned to the sincere followers of Islam and living as we do in a world of many faiths, this experience has served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the sensibilities of others.\\" Rushdie regrets this action  deeply in his memoir because it was against whatever he stood for. It must have been very hard for an irreligious atheist to admit being a religious Muslim.<br /><br />On his personal life, Rushdie is very honest about his four broken marriages. He does not come off well in the way his first three marriages ended. He himself admits that his fourth wife, the supermodel Padma Lakshmi, paid him back in his own coin by breaking his heart and ending their marriage even though he still  wanted to be with her. The irony was that she left him for an even older man after complaining repeatedly to Rushdie that he was `too old' for her! However, Rushdie comes off as a devoted father to his two sons, Zafar and Milan.<br /><br />Another poignant event of those ten years is his forced exile from India, land of his birth. Just as in Britain, the Indian politicians were terrified of an Islamic backlash  and were  the first to ban `Satanic Verses'. They also denied him a visa to come back `home' during those ten years. For me, as an Indian, it is such a sad and shameful turn of events. Rushdie eventually gets permission to visit India after 1999 and he comes back `home' to a tumultuous welcome from the civil society and the media. Rushdie touchingly writes on the occasion that he felt like dropping to his knees and kissing the earth as he landed in Delhi airport.<br /><br />Rushdie does not have much time for Pakistan, its military dictatorships and religious extremism. Sadly for him, his irreligious parents decide to move to Pakistan in their later years, citing curiously the reason of finding `good Muslim husbands' for their daughters. Rushdie writes that this sounds dubious at best and that his parents never came clean to him about the reason for leaving Bombay in favor of Karachi, Pakistan. However, I must point out a counter to this view from a Pakistani journalist, Ajaz Ashraf. Ashraf writes that Rushdie's  aunts (two of his mother's sisters) were married  to high-ranking Pakistanis. One of them, Colonel Majeed Malik, was close to Pakistan's founder Md. Ali Jinnah and had the dubious distinction of censoring and doctoring Jinnah's biography and making it a sanitised version. The other was Shahid Hamid, who played a key role in Field Marshal Ayub Khan's rise to power in the 1960s. Later on, Hamid went on to found the notorious Spy agency, ISI,  and worked under Gen.Zia-ul-Haq. The journalist Ashraf contends that Rushdie must have known that his family moved to Pakistan opportunistically  to benefit from relatives who were in positions of power there. Rushdie does not even mention any of these relatives in his memoir. So, there may be some truth in the claims. But I can understand Rushdie's reluctance to deal elaborately with the Pakistani side of his family because his own life simply has nothing to do with Pakistan.<br /><br />The memoir makes absorbing reading and is written straight from the heart. It is perhaps a tad long at 636 pages and at times feels a little repetitive. Some readers may feel that Rushdie drops too many names in his narrative but I didn't feel that way. Because of his special situation, it was only natural that he got to meeting high-profile leaders like Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Klaus Kinkel and so on. Being an acclaimed British writer in English, it is also not unusual that he practically knew all the big names in the British Literary and Publishing world.<br /><br />It is an excellent memoir.the publication has occasioned to the sincere followers of Islam and living as we do in a world of many faiths, this experience has served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the sensibilities of others.\\" Rushdie regrets this action  deeply in his memoir because it was against whatever he stood for.

B007REV4T8|1.0|Even though never did I warm up to the choice of Daniel Graig as the next Bond (I still think Clive Owen would had been a better fit), I had to admit that [[ASIN:B000FIGHNQ Casino Royale]] was an excellent Bond film. With all the explosive and seductive sequences and all its gadgets (and product placement) one would expect. It was great, solid entertainment.<br /><br />Then came [[ASIN:B001QE1BDY Quantum of Solace]] and it turned out to be little more than a patchwork of all the leftovers from Casino. As a coda, it had its uses. As a new film, it would not be missed. Little did I know how the future held an even greater disappointment.<br /><br />I was truly hyped to watch SKYFALL. All the critics praised it and all the buzz was how Mendes managed to revive and, at the same time, humanize Bond. He did not. He did not even try.<br /><br />The film suffers from a number of shortcomings. The script is weaker than milk and water trying to pass as English tea. Javier does a decent job portraying an albino(?) villain, if not a bit caricaturish. It is the script that make him look incompetent though.<br />Would you hire a world renown surgeon to clip your nails? How about a champion fisherman to catch fish you already have in a barrel? Well, this supervillain hires a top assassin to snipe at a man who is already surrounded by his men.<br />If in the post 9/11 world, you somehow managed to get your hands on a military helicopter, would you not remember to equip it with a couple of rockets not to have to rely on its puny machine gun?<br />And would you endanger your freedom and even your survival in order to kill the person you hate - if you could kill them (and watch them suffer) half a world away by pressing a button? Well, he does exactly that. More than once.<br /><br />Even then, MI6 is portrayed as even more incompetent. For such a rabid foe was amassing fortune, recruiting henchmen and organizing for years - without MI6 ever wising up to him. And would you ditch your company car because &#34;they are all bugged&#34; - only to try to get away undetected with yet another fully equipped ...company car?<br /><br />Nevertheless, these are not why the latest Bond film fails. Even if realism was the direction recently taken, when was any Bond film able to hold up to such scrutiny? No, the film fails because it is not fun to watch. Most of the action in the film takes place before the opening credits. After that, it is all looks and silences and word association. And, contrary to other Bond films, I could not care less about anything going on on the screen.<br /><br />This semblance of a story unfolds in a staccato sequence of locations, each resembling an episode shot at a different set. There is neither continuity nor coherence. At the beginning, someone steals an MI6 NOC list in Turkey (I will not even ask what was such a list doing outside the vault and into the field!) and halfway through the movie everyone forgets about it(!) Who cares about all these deep agents, lets save the snotty aristocrat, right? Sadly, if you have seen the trailer, you have seen all there is to see of this film.<br /><br />I am afraid they destroyed more than the classic DB5 with this one.company car because &#34;they are all bugged&#34; - only to try to get away undetected with yet another fully equipped ...company car?<br /><br />Nevertheless, these are not why the latest Bond film fails.

B008NW67E0|5.0|After seeing Mumford and Sons on the Grammy's I researched them immediately and was very impressed.  After listening to Sigh No More at every opportunity I rushed to purchase Babel.  I am equally enamored of this new album and find it a gem in every way.<br /><br />I realize that this is not the appropriate place to make this comment, but here goes.  Thanks to Live on Letterman and AT&T for the concert.  It has helped to make Babel and Mumford and Sons along with Sigh No More even more of a joy.  To the eyes, the ears and the heart.
1401323820|4.0|I like the series. It's easy reading a good weekend book. It drags in spots, but it gets better in a few pages.<br />I only started buying the books after becoming a fan of the TV show. Before then I didn't know there was an actual Richard Castle writer book series. The books are entertaining. We belong to a book club, so we have ordered quite a few of his books from there, and have been very happy with our purchases.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The only reason this book received 4 stars instead of 5 from me is that it subverts expectations brought on by the nature of who authored it. If you think of this book as authored by someone you don't already know, then you will likely enjoy it more. It is dark (and depressing, as others have noted) and it does take quite a while to get oriented to the vast array of characters that switch back and forth faster than you can get used to \\"who was that again?\\"<br /><br />But barring those issues, this was an engaging read. The tragic heroine of Krystal is almost instantly sympathetic, and the other characters have distinctive, \\"I-can-relate\\" personalities that at times make you feel superior and other times make you realize that you have faults you may be unaware of, too.<br /><br />The story is rife with possibilities for social commentary on community responsibility to the disadvantaged and addicted. Terri Wheedon is an unfortunate poster-child for the struggle that our neighbors go through to make good choices despite their disease.<br /><br />I will probably read this book again.
0670020745|5.0|Strokes can be severely debilitating.  Recovery is often slow and rarely full.  [[ASIN:0452295548 My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey]] is Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor's account of her own devastating stroke and the long road back to herself.  Because she is a brain research scientist, her observations and conclusions are objective and knowledgeable.  Because she is human, her revelations and insights are compassionate and hopeful.<br /><br />Not only does she provide crucially valuable advice for victims of stroke and those who interact with and care for them, but she also shares her personal discovery that the power to choose a state of spiritual peace appears to reside in the right hemisphere of the brain.  Her experiences during her stroke and eight years of recovery have led her to believe that each of us has the ability to access that peace.<br /><br />Originally, I checked out the library's copy to read for a book discussion group.  Her writing style is so conversational and easy to digest -- especially the scientific information, which she contains in two stand-alone chapters -- and her subject so important and compelling, that I bought a copy to keep for future reference.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just can't wait for the number 3 book to come out it was a great book well written but we should not have to wait till march that suck I guess I have to read the book again so I don't forget what happen when they release the third book
B000002IM7|5.0|I am amazed at how diverse and TIGHT this three-piece band is. Why I waited so long to catch up on all of the King's X CD's was because their CD \\"Faith, Love, and Hope\\" was promoted as a religious album. By that time the whole religious CD industry had turned in on itself and became just another big business. King'g X is admittedly not a religious band, although they lack the angst on most non-religious CDs and do occasionally sing about God. As for mentioning God in a song ... so what? They don't preach, or align with any religious niche. They are a positive force. Yes, they are spiritual and yes you will feel as though their music is \\"lifting\\" you. They tour with every album they've released for 23 years now. Live, they are astonishingly tight and seamless. I hope they go on forever. Their latest came out in 2012.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Loved it so much. I really could feel for Eva and I'm heart went out to her. I would recommend this book. Its a great read.
1619691809|5.0|As is usually the case with Nelson DeMille he has written an action packed thriller.  John Cory and wife Kate Mayfield are great defenders of the free world.  John is his old sarcastic self with Kate keeping him in tow.  My husband and I listened to this on an audio book while on a long trip.  It certainly kept us interested and entertained.  We loved it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another excellent book by Kate Morton.  I could not put the book down and was sorry it ended.  I felt involved.  Highly recommend this book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|We just upgraded to a Blu-ray player and this was one of our 1st purchases. This movie is amazing on blu-ray. Puts DVD to shame in picture quality.
B004LUS390|5.0|i was scared to buy this, because everyone was saying it doesnt work on the kindle fire. but i did, and it works really well. its a little confusing at first, but then you get the hang of it
0425263916|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades of Grey trilogy, this is the next trilogy for you. Super hot and sexy writing. You will get sucked into Eva and Gideon's story. Can't wait for the 3rd book to be published.

B001S2PT3M|5.0|Gotta love Doakes in this season.  He is constantly messing with Dexter, following him, taunting him, but Dexter just bides his time smartly, cooly.  I love this season.  Not a huge fan of Rita though but that is soon solved for us all now isnt it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|We just upgraded to a Blu-ray player and this was one of our 1st purchases. These movies are amazing on blu-ray. Puts DVD to shame in picture quality.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|One of only a few shows I can honestly say that I have watched many times through.  I love Michael Hall and have loved him since Six Feet Under.  It was hard to see him as a straight man in this serious for an episode or two and then I got used to it.  That was the only hitch but not anyone's fault.  People write horrible reviews for Dexter because their sense of morality feels to be in jeopardy by watching it.  Its a great show.  Depth, cliffhanger suspense, peril, gritty insight into each character as the seasons pass, unexpected twists.  You really cant get better television than you get with Dexter.  By far my favorite show ever put on the screen.  Blu ray is definitely worth the extra few dollars as it is masterfully done both in sound quality and picture clarity.  I LOVE THIS SHOW.
0425263908|5.0|f you liked 50 Shades of Grey trilogy, this is the next trilogy for you. Super hot and sexy writing. You will get sucked into Eva and Gideon's story. Can't wait for the 3rd book to be published.
0307895475|5.0|If you want to get the most bang for your buck out of your game and be able to complete everything there is to do in the game then this strategy guide can get you there.  Many guides are unecessary and a waste of money but Bethesda has always put forth a bunch of effort to make sure the guides made for their elder scrolls games are COMPLETE.  I highly recommend this in depth and comprehensive book.

B0070NSPCU|4.0|This book started a little slow for me (first chapter or two), but picked up quickly and ended up being a book I had a hard time putting down.
B007V65R54|2.0|Disappionting....<br />I have tremendous respect for Nate Silver, but this book was quite a big disappointment. Many of the previous negative reviews have already outline its short comings. Pricipal among them is its utter failure to deliver on the second half of the sub-title, \\"Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't\\". The book provide ample evidence of failures, but so few insight into what to do other than use Bayesian approaches. This book can be summed about by saying \\"Prediction is hard, but by using Bayesian approaches we can improve on the situation.\\" However, there is so little insight into their proper application. If you are a practitioner, I would pass on this. If you are a layperson interested in why so many predictions go wrong, you'll probably find this amusing and entertaining.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Marvel and Stan Lee does it again with Avengers. Can't wait for part two. This is awesome!! All star cast, great CGI, and the storyline was good that it connected to the previous marvel movies(hulk, ironman, captain america, & thor). A must watch if you're a comic book fan or a marvel fan. 👍👍👏👏✌
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|If you EVER liked Donna Summer, you will like \\"Crayons\\"!<br />This album is only a slight departure from her well-known style, and her voice was at top form when she cut this album.<br />The arrangements and recording quality are first-rate, too.<br />\\"Crayons\\" is definitely Donna at her best!
B00005JMAH|5.0|Alfonso Cuaron directs this third installment of the \\"Harry Potter\\" saga--the one in which the young wizard does not deal directly with his great adversary.<br /> It begins one late summer evening at the home of the Dursleys(Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw)where young Harry is in bed practicing magical incantations, resulting in a light from his wand so brilliant and extensive that a puzzled Uncle Vernon repeatedly checks on him, only to find the 13-year-old(to whom Daniel Radcliffe has loaned much of his own prankish nature) feigning sleep whenever Vernon opens his bedroom door.<br /> Soon Harry endures a visit from Vernon's canineophilic sister,Marge(Pam Ferris), who brings her small dog with her, and takes the Dursley's line against Harry, who grows angry at all the lies told about him and his dead parents. Her retribution for hacking off the young wizard is initially the inexplicable breaking of the glass from which she was drinking, but after one last wrongful accusation against Harry's mother, Aunt Marge begins to inflate in a scene remiscent of the fate of Violent Beaureagarde in \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". But instead of turning blue, she flies through the double doors leading to the Dursleys' backyard, and is soon aloft over Privet Drive. Despite Vernon's warning that Harry won't be able to return to Hogwarts due to his illicit use of magic, our irate young hero packs up and leaves, realizing how alone he is while sitting curbside outside a playground as evening sets in.<br /> But the call of Hogwarts is never ignored.A big black dog in the bushes across the street snarls at the teen, but he is unexpectedly rescued by the Knight Bus, a royal blue triple decker including beds and a chandelier, which, as conductor Stan Shunpike(Lee Ingleby) explains, is dedicated to rescuing stranded witches and wizards.As his wild ride to the Leaky Cauldron, courtesy of driver Ernie Prang(Jimmy Gardner) begins, Harry inquires about a man pictured on the front page ofa newspaper Shunpike was reading, and learns that he is Sirius Black(Gary Oldman), an escaped convict from Azkaban, the Wizards' maximum security prison, who was affiliated with Voldemort.An ornamental shrunken head, voiced by Lenny Henry, provides moments of comic relief during the trip.<br /> After his arrival, the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge(Robert Hardy), tells him that the matter regarding his aunt has been resolved, and of his consequential re-instatement at Hogwarts. The Minister has kindly taken the liberty of having Harry's textbooks sent over, including a very tempestuous Book of Monsters with which Harry will have a tempestuous confronation in his room in the company of his unfazed pet owl, Hedwig.<br /> The next morning, he is happily reunited with a quarreling Ron(Rupert Grint) and Hermione(Emma Watson), who need to keep their pets--Hermione's cat, Crookshanks and Ron's rat,Scabbers, apart from each other.At breakfast, Ron shows Harry the article of his family's summer trip to Egypt as the Weasley twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Platt), tease him about repeatedly showing the article.Mrs. Weasley(Julie Walters) checks to see if Harry is all set for school while Mr. Weasley(Mark Williams)warns him that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to kill him.<br /> With this new concern on his mind, Harry, Hermione, and the Weasley siblings board the Hogwarts Express. In what will be an ironic moment, Mrs. Weasley hands Scabbers to Ron through the train window, warning him not to lose him.<br /> Occupying the only available compartment on the train, the three are seated by a sleeping Professor Remus J. Lupin(David Thewlis), who wakes up in time to stave off a sinister dementor, a banshee-like guard of Azkaban, who was searching the train for Sirius Black. Harry, whose soul was nearly sucked out by the dementor passes out, and is given a piece of chocolate by Lupin, who subsequently goes to speak with the driver about this incident, to help him regain his strength.<br /> During the banquet opening the schoolyear, Headmaster Dumbledore(Michael Gambon, replacing the late Richard Harris), introduces Lupin as the new defense Against that Dark Arts Professor, Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane) as the new Care of Magical Creatures Professor, and warns that the dangerous dementors are in place to protect the school from Sirius Black.Dumbledore's observation about about light being found in the darkest of times is embodied by the sight of Harry and his roommates yukking it up with magical candies that cause them to make animal sounds or emote steam from their ears. But they had to get past Dawn French's overbearing and untalented Fat Lady to reach their dorms.Outside, on a proverbial dark and stormy night, the sinister airborne dementors stand guard.<br /> Among the new subjects they  learn are Divination, taught by Professor Sybil Trelawney(Emma Thompson), in whose class a skeptical Hermione will later have a breakdown, the Care of Magical Creatures, in which Hagrid introduces the Hippogryff, Buckbeak who Harry is allowed to fly as part of a demeonstration on dealing with such a creature. While the flight is initially one of trepidation, Harry soon enjoys it immensely. But soon, Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton), spoils the fun by provoking Buckbeak, who in return, knocks him down, injuring him slightly. Draco's exaggeration of the extent of his injuries, making the situation more critical than necessary.<br /> In Lupin's class, students learn how to turn the objects of their worst fears into something funny. But the lesson ends abruptly when Harry encounters a boggart in the shape of a dementor, Lupin intervenes, fearing it could turn into Voldemort.<br /> While other students take a field trip to nearby Hogsmeade village, Harry, whose permission slip for the trip was unsigned, makes use of his time talking with Lupin, who explains why Harry is more affected by dementors than most, and shares his memories of Harry's parents.The lad listensreverently to the story of his mother's kindness, and with puckish self-consciousness regarding the talent for trouble he inherited from his father.<br /> Things intensify when the devasted Fat Lady reports Sirius Black to be in the castle. Shortly thereafter, Professor Snape(Alan Rickman) inexplicably tales over Lupin's class, skipping ahead in the text to a section on werewolves, on which students must write essays.<br /> A perilous Quidditch match, played in a storm, ends with a fulfillment of Trelawney's prophecy about Harry's having the grim.Ending up in the hospital with his broom irreparably broken by the Whomping Willow after the game after a dementor attacks him.Lupin's mentorship of Harry continues and he promises to teach Harry how to fight the dementors in special after-class sessions.<br /> Winter finds students en route to Hogsmeade again.Harry's intial attempt to sneak over to Hogsmeade to join them beneath his invisibility cloak is foiled by the Weasley Twins, who see his footprints in the snow and drag him aside to introduce him to the Marauder's Map, which shows the precise whereabouts of everyone at Hogwarts. They teach him how to open it and close it to keep prying eyes from viewing its contents.<br /> On his illicit journey to Hogsmeade, Harry steals Neville Longbottom's (Matthew Lewis) lollipop in the candy store, and while still invisible, singlehandedly beats up Malfoy, Crabbe(Jamie Wylett) and Goyle(Josh Herdman), when they corner Ron and Hermione.<br /> Revealing himself to his best friends after the bullies are chased away, the three travel through the village. Pausing outside the 3 Broomsticks pub where proprietor Madame Rosmerta(Julie Christie) greets Professor McGonnagall(Maggie Smith) and the Minister of Magic, Harry hears his name mentioned in their discussion. After sneaking into the pub's private room, he learns about Peter Pettigrew(Timothy Spall), how Sirius killed him, after betraying Harry's parents, and the astonishing fact ofSirius being his godfather.<br /> Harry will step up his private lessons on fighting the dementors, and deal with Sirius Black under Lupin's tutelage.But with Ron and Hermione, he will also face the grave injustice involving Buckbeak. Trelawney's other prophecy, stated while in a trance, will play out, and young Harry will have to control his youthful, passionate anger to sort out the truth about Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, as well as Scabbers and the mysterious dog he encountered the night he was driven to the Leaky Cauldron.<br /> Things come to a head inside the Whomping Willow and the Shreiking Shack, getting even more muddled just outside of those areas. But while not everything is resolved satisfactorily, with teamwork, intellect, and the magical ability to turn back time, many issues will be.Lupin will have the satisfaction of seeing how much Harry has learned.<br /> Another bully for the wizard in glasses! We solemnly swear that Harry and company are up to some good!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It's just hard to enjoy a movie in which the characters are forgettable and the story is just a weak setup for them all to die. Meh.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Another great mystery from Cornwell.  I liked this book better than Red Mist.  But, Cornwell is a descriptive and detailed writer.  She is one of my favorites.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game so much it is so fun getting the big coin and then getting the prize<br /><br />thank you for making this game Maddie wells
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Firstly I must say that I do like classical style movie soundtracks and I love the filmed versions of these books.<br /><br />Howard Shore created a series of themes that complement the movies perfectly, enchanting, melodic, dark at times, exciting at others.  So how does this epic musical work stand up without the images?  Very well.  Whilst I do not return to them as regularly as other works, I do return to them and find myself in Middle Earth on an epic journey.<br /><br />The nuances of the score have mood changes that move you from light hearted magical moments to the depths of despair and into battles so huge in scope that you come out at the end exhausted.<br /><br />Whilst there are many parts of this score that repeat its two predecessors, its a must have for any soundtrack collection and one I highly recommend.
B000SEFM6K|3.0|I read The Woman in White on a very good recommendation, and I was disappointed. Although the basic storyline is interesting it is waaaay too long. It takes a long time for the \\"mystery\\" itself to develop and the progression is slow. I realize that the book is a product of its time but if you are looking for a thrilling old-timey mystery this is not it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|A wonderment of puzzle / physics combo. A game with an insane amount of character and whit meshed with a slew of levels that could have only been crafted by mad geniuses with a heavy knowledge of physics based mechanics. Different birds as different weapons / abilities makes the game replayable and adds more birdies to fall in love with!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoyed playing this app. I had originally come across it on an Apple product and thought it was fairly fun. Of course, they didn't have it in Amazon yet because Apple is more developed and is, in my opinion, better. And although they are expensive, they are well worth the money.<br />Enough of my Apple complements and Amazon bashes; let's get back to the app review.<br />The app itself is fun and entertaining. In my years of critiquing, I've never seen another app like it. I'm sure there are more out there because they copied off of Flow, but none will be as good as Flow itself.<br />If you get bored easily, this app IS for you! Flow is addicting and puzzling. It will keep you playing for hours, and you won't even know how much time has passed. Puzzle after perplexing puzzle, level after difficult level, I enjoyed Flow at it's whole. It even got a few swears out of me! (In a good way. It was one hard puzzle...!)<br /><br />All in all, I give this app 4 stars. I would recommend it to anyone who asked.<br /><br />-C. Raff
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game for a short amount of time! Addictive and well made. super responsive and PowerUp heavy gameplay. Great structure and store for implementing maximum replayability.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the great signature stamps of movies over the last 50 years has been the opening sequences of the James Bond films.  This newest version is no exception and certainly must rank as one of the best.<br /><br />Bond (Daniel Craig) is on the trail of a mysterious evil-doer who has managed to obtain a computer drive that contains the names of deep cover agents who have infiltrated various terrorist organizations.  Bond is shot by mistake by Eve (Naomie Harris), an agent working with him and is believed to have been killed falling into a fast moving river.<br /><br />Now certainly at the 20 minute mark we know Bond isn't actually dead.  After a few months of pounding down booze on some unknown island he learns that his boss \\"M\\" (Judi Dench) is under scrutiny for losing the agent names.  Bond resurfaces and manages to track down the culprit in southern China.<br /><br />Bond films have another common component throughout the years.  The villain.  They are always rich.  They are always powerful.  And they always want more.  As one of the best bad guys in memory, Oscar winner Javier Bardem plays Silva, a one-time MI6 agent and computer genius.  He doesn't necessarily want more money and power, he wants revenge.  He's after \\"M\\" who he feels betrayed him years earlier.<br /><br />Directed by another Oscar winner, Sam Mendes, \\"Skyfall\\" focuses on the actors.  Terrific performances are coaxed out of Craig, Bardem and especially Dench, another Oscar winner.  Mendes also manages to blend in many older Bond staples, not the least of which is 007's pristine Aston Martin DB:5, with some new; including updated versions of old characters (Q and Ms. Moneypenny) along with another surprise.<br /><br />While the heart of this film is in the story and the emotion rarely seen in the franchise, \\"Skyfall\\" is not short on what makes it Bond.  There are glorious visuals, especially in Shanghai, a cool gadget or two (but no exploding pen), hot girls and a memorable final act.  While I have a fondness for all the Bond films and all the actors who played 007, this one may be at the top of the heap.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (3-17-13):  This was my favorite movie of 2012, so watching it again on Blu ray was high on my list of things to do.  If anything, I'm more impressed.  Not having to worry about plot details, I was able to focus on the production values, soundtrack, editing and yes the quality of the transfer.  All of which equal my appreciation for the film.<br /><br />Here, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed to have been killed, but resurfaces when he sees his boss \\"M\\" (Judi Dench) under political pressure for allowing a list of embedded NATO agents to be acquired by the bad guys.  Both Bond and \\"M\\" are tired and seem unlikely to continue.  But they do.  Director Sam Mendes (who also contributes one of the 2 commentary tracks) masterfully integrates a change for future Bond films including new characters who blend in nicely with the past.<br /><br />One of the things I noticed is the great photography in this film which sparkles in this 1080p transfer.  The colors are off the chart.  The blacks are black.  Check out the gorgeous shot of Shanghai at night, dense with colorful lighting against the black sky.  When the story moves to Scotland, the palette changes to greens, blues and browns as the topography changes.  From what I can tell, this transfer does not include any IMAX images shown in some theaters.<br /><br />Like the video, the audio track is exemplary.  Using the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, a properly set up room bristles with activity including a marvelous opening sequence.  As opposed to every other Bond film, the conclusion of the scene results in Bond and MI6's failure to get the bad guy(s).  As the Oscar winning song by Adele plays over the credits, we yearn for the next event.  The surrounds are active with waterfalls, crashing glass, helicopters, gunfire and explosions throughout the film.  The dialog is always crystal clear throughout.<br /><br />Extras include a second commentary track by the current generation of Broccoli producers and production designer Dennis Gassner, a 59 minute \\"Shooting Bond\\" documentary, a short set of \\"Skyfall\\" premier interviews, a trailer, a soundtrack promo and a slew of other film trailers.r throughout.<br /><br />Extras include a second commentary track by the current generation of Broccoli producers and production designer Dennis Gassner, a 59 minute \\"Shooting Bond\\" documentary, a short set of \\"Skyfall\\" premier interviews, a trailer, a soundtrack promo and a slew of other film trailers.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Highly addictive and beautifully crafted, the visuals aid the already smooth motion of a totally eccentric and interesting game. The excellent use of gesture/swipes to make the game an extension of your hand as the controller is wonderful.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author is obivously well educated.  he uses terms only a doctor would use, but he brings it down to a level that a person who did not attend med school would understand because he clarifies his terminology quite well using layman's terms in parentheses.  Also, I had to re-read many sentences because he clarifies so much in parentheses.  The clarifications help, but are in many sentences.  So, be patient and re-read the sentences a second time without reading the parentheses.  This will help.  This author makes a good case to show that science & theology can co-exist & agree.
0425263908|1.0|If like me you loved Fifty Shades of Grey, you won't like this book. It is not nearly as well written, and most of the major themes were blatantly copied. You might think that this would make this book likeable, but because it is not written as well, it comes across as a cheap copy. Also, if what you liked about FSoG was the male domination in the bedroom and the suggestive BDSM play scenarios, then you won't find that in this book. The whole story feels rushed, and forgive me, the writing style is a bit immature (everything is \\"kick ass\\" and \\"smoking hot\\") what is this, college?! Fifty Shades was far more elegantly written, had more emotion and heart in it. This book was a disappointment and so I can only recommend that those who loved FSoG's intense passion and erotic play give this one a miss.

B007REV4T8|5.0|M made a decision in the past that hurt someone? Yes, and that tough call complicates matters for MI6; even James Bond's loyalty is put to the test. However, with world class villains (and his own death) to contend with, there isn't a moment to reflect on her misdeeds.<br /><br />Director Sam Mendes (\\"Revolutionary Road\\") is working for the first time with the Broccoli family, who has owned this Bond franchise for 50 years. There is no doubt Mendes knows exactly what the fans expect, he delivers non-stop action, wonderful reminders of past Bond films, lots of gunfire and fisticuffs, plus oodles of blowie uppie stuff!<br /><br />We recognize the regulars, but watch for some new ones, too:<br />  * Daniel Craig (\\"Defiance\\") is back as Bond, resurrected from the dead and furious that M gave the order to shoot him (he was wearing an ear bud). Now he must cope with a damaged body that doesn't do quite what he wants.<br />  * Judi Dench (\\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\") is still M, beleaguered, bedeviled and besieged. Of course, her quips are almost as funny as Bond's.<br />  * Ben Whishaw (\\"Cloud Atlas\\") is the callow youth who personifies this generation of technophiles. Yup, to Bond's dismay, this mop-headed geek is our new Q and we love him from the get-go!<br />  * Naomie Harris (\\"Mandala, Long Walk to Freedom\\") is Bond's sidekick in the opening scenes in Istanbul. Wait until you hear her last name!<br />  * Javier Barden (\\"Biutiful\\") seems to have SUCH fun playing villains; this flaxen-haired bad guy is almost as persistent as our hero; he just doesn't know when to quit! Revenge is a powerful motivator.<br /><br />This popular franchise illustrates what we mean when we say \\"sensory overload.\\" It isn't necessary to suspend disbelief in these things because we know as we walk in the door that we will be bombarded with PG-13 cartoony violence, hair's-breath escapes and quippy dialogue. It's what we want, it's what we pay for and it's what we get!<br /><br />With thisone, even though it satisfies the target audience, I must admit that I was shaken, not stirred.<br /><br />When I get the DVD from Amazon, the closed captions will make up for the missing dialog, then I can love it like the rest of the audience!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book reads alot like Gone Girl, if you have read that one. The story is written from multiple perspectives, each chapter being from a different POV with the main character narrating the majority of chapters. It really keeps you guessing until the very end. I found it hard to put down at times. The main character is not what I expected, she is moody and generally depressed. Her character does lend a fair bit of dark humor in her narration. I would recomend this as a good suspense novel.
B0087ITC56|5.0|Have you ever wondered if you really have to fasten your seat belt on an airliner? This film will leave NO doubt! We open with scenes that provide background for a subsequent, harrowing, plane crash. Director Robert Zemeckis (\\"Cast Away\\") knows how to set the stage.<br /><br />After the astonishing but miraculous crash of an airliner, bits of disturbing information begin to surface about the brilliant pilot whose amazing skills dazzled the experts. Was he drunk? Was that cocaine in his blood? Watch the attorney for the pilots' union as he tries to formulate our hero's defense.<br /><br />Here is the high-flying cast:<br />  * Denzel Washington (\\"Safe House\\") This guy is clear about one thing: He is NOT an alcoholic! We see why flying is in his blood. He's a better pilot while impaired, than most other pilots at their very best. Yes, he's arrogant, but to quote Dizzy Dean, \\"If you can do it, it ain't braggin'.<br />  * Tamara Tunie (\\"Law and Order, SVU\\") Here we see a truly heroic flight attendant in action. Wow!<br />  * Don Cheadle (\\"The Guard\\") This is how attorneys strategize. We may not respect his methods, but even though we know better, we still root for the defendant, so we appreciate how this guy thinks.<br />  * John Goodman (\\"Argus\\") practically steals the show as a skilled purveyor of controlled substances and pharmaceuticals. His name is \\"on the list.\\"<br />  * Kelly Reilly (\\"Sherlock Holmes\\") looks like a young Dianne Keaton in her portrayal of a down-on-her-luck sometime actress who tries to hold onto a few standards for herself.<br />  * Bruce Greenwood (\\"Super 8\\") is always a good utility man; this time he is our hero's last friend.<br /><br />As a private pilot, I am unfamiliar with the instrument panel in an airliner, but I could certainly relate to issues as they came up. When the rudder, elevator and flaps malfunctioned, my heart was pounding along with everyone else's. Brace yourself for lots of nudity, profanity, drug use, and an extended, veryeffective scene with an airliner in distress. Whew!<br /><br />Amazon will notify me when this is available on DVD.
B009DZDJU6|3.0|I have read and heard many complaints this is not a historically accurate movie about Abraham Lincoln. Well, duh!! It is just an entertaining movie involving around one of our greatest presidents and the event that defined us as a nation, The Civil War. If you watch this movie with that belief I think you will find it entertaining. The only disappointment for me in the movie that it wasn't a cross over movie and didn't kill any of the Twilight characters.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|There are times I am out of step with popular trends; I was urged to read Yann Martel's enormously popular novel while it was on the best-seller list. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that I did not like it, in fact I disliked it! To me, the story of an Indian boy who is shipwrecked with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger is a bit much.<br /><br />With the astonishing Ang Lee as the director (\\"The Wedding Banquet,\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" \\"Hulk,\\" and \\"The Ice Storm\\"), things started looking up. As you can see from this sample of his work, this much-acclaimed artist never stays with one genre, never copies other filmmakers and never plays it safe. He rarely makes a PG film and I think this is his first 3D project.<br /><br />He did wonders with his cast:<br />  * Suraj Sharma (in his first film role) is Pi, an adventurous, inquisitive youngster. He has settled on being a vegetarian Hindu Muslim who embraces Catholic guilt, studies the Jewish Kabbalah, and wants to be baptized. He is convinced that religion is a big house with many rooms.<br />  * Irrfan Khan (\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" and \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\") is the adult Pi, who tells his spellbinding tale to a would-be author.<br />  * Rafe Spall (\\"Prometheus\\") is our incredulous listener, The Writer, who speaks for us as he expresses all the confusion, dismay and doubt that we in the audience naturally feel.<br />  * The tiger who plays Richard Parker is a seamless combination of real life and computer generated images. Brilliant!<br /><br />3D is rarely used this well, maybe you can get a new player from Amazon. The opening credit sequence that takes us through a small municipal zoo in India is a marvel, and the scenes with clear water are breathtaking: you can't tell water from air, so things seem to be floating above the earth. Kudos to Cinematographer Claudio Miranda for the dazzling effects! (We LOVED the flying fish!)<br /><br />The continuity is consistently good:as time goes by in the lifeboat, our hero and our tiger are visibly thinner, the tiger's teeth become greenish and both of them have dry unhealthy hair. The shipwreck is tough to see, but we don't have to watch carnivores kill their lunch, and when Pi finally brains a fish, he weeps and apologizes to it. Don't show this to toddlers, but from ten years old and up, I think a child can handle it.<br /><br />In my opinion, this was much better than the book! (But I still hate the island!)
0307341550|4.0|I enjoyed this mystery by Gillian Flynn.  In this novel, journalist Camille Preaker returns to her hometown to cover the story of a missing child.  The child comes up missing just months after another child is found murdered in a creek bed.  Camille must deal with her own family issues  and personal demons as she attempts to investigate the story that she was assigned.  The novel is a very quick read, but is very dark and not for the faint of heart.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was amazing. I recommend this book to anyone who is yearning to hear what happens as souls make the transition after leaving their earthly bodies.  The experience the author talks about is very similar to those someone close to me has talked about.  Though the person I knew did not have a life after death experience, but rather was psychic and received her information from her \\"connection.\\"  This person noted, as did the doctor, that there are no words in our English language that would be able to describe adequately, or that we could even comprehend to explain the experience in the afterlife. I am so glad the doctor wrote this book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Based on all the hype about this book I anticipated another cheesy romance novel. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this story had more substance than that. Sexuality, especially female sexuality, is a taboo new frontier in popular literature, but certainly worth exploration. I thought Fifty Shades Book 1 was good first attempt at discussing the sexual relationships of men and women in our culture from a literary position. The greatest downfall of this novel is that it was obviously edited and published as a \\"bang book\\". James' surprisingly intelligent commentary on the psychological and emotional factors of sex are frequently rushed or glossed over to get to the next detailed account of Ana and Christian's passionate encounters. I hope that the following books delve a little deeper into the development of their relationship and its meaning while maintaining the well written descriptions of their intense lovemaking. The topic of female sexuality and the physical relationships of men and women in our society today certainly merits literary discussion. I recommend this book for any female readers who are not turned off (pun intended) by graphic descriptions of sex. It's a fast read, very entertaining and culturally relevant, always leaving you wanting to know what happens next in the saga of Christian and Ana.

B0021L8V0W|5.0|I'm not a real huge Angelina fan, but everything I've seen her in she has done an excellent job. This movie is no exception. Acquiring this in Blu-ray was a must. I've seen the progression to Blu-ray and must say the clarity is striking.
B0030B624E|5.0|Well-paced, well-written, well-acted.  The gore is great, there's rollicking fun, TONS of belly laughs, and it merits many re-viewings.  Can't hardly say more good things about a film unless you're collecting royalty checks on it!<br /><br />NOW, for those of open minds who also love a truly fun zomedy, there's Chronicles of Zombia!  A short web serial, you can find the currently posted installments on their YouTube channel at [...] Anyone viewing Zombia who is not 100% satisfied will be refunded 100% of their purchase price.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|There's enough funny stuff there to make it entertaining, without some of the ridiculous over the top humor he did in other movies.  I liked it better than Borat, never watched Bruno after reading some reviews.
1451638450|5.0|I read my first Lois McMaster Bujold book a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away....  Anyway, this one was very entertaining and I was delighted to see Ivan as the focus rather than Miles.  I love Miles, don't get me wrong, but I was happy to see Ivan fleshed out, as well as seeing more of his mother and Simon--not to mention Gregor.  I read this in a day and a half and was very entertained from the time I picked it up.  For fans of Ms. Bujold, you're in for a treat.  For those who didn't like this, I don't think you like any of Ms. Bujold's books.  This one had humor and adventure, as well as more than one romance.  How fun
0307960471|4.0|In the three years since the conclusion of \\"The Leopard,\\" Harry Hole has been serving contentedly as a non-violent enforcer based in Hong Kong, collecting money owed to his employer.  Then one day, he ups and returns to Oslo when he learns that Oleg, the drug-using son of the love of his life, has been arrested for the murder of a fellow junkie. The police consider the case closed, so Harry acts independently to investigate.<br /><br />And along the way he finds himself immersed in the midst of Norway's large drug problem.  Hole uncovers a trail of violence and disappearances, police and political corruption, and Harry himself becomes a target of the mysterious drug lord Dubai.  The novel is a bleak story of damaged individuals hooked on drugs, and the sleaziness inherent in the activity.<br /><br />The prior novels were forceful, clearly showing Harry's tortured soul, and his unswerving ability to dig, dig, dig to the heart of a case, honestly and insightfully.  \\"Phantom\\" accomplishes these ends, but to some extent is confusing at the end; whether the author did this purposely or not yet remains to be seen.  As usual, the novel is translated faithfully and excellently, and the book is recommended.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I finished the Kindle free first in the series and immediately had to buy the whole set... just had to know 'what happens next' to the characters...all of them.  a cliff hanger.  and not a fantasy... definitely a 'this could happen' type of fiction.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War is a very good read and serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in the Korean War. It is not a complete history of the war as it is singularly focused on the bungled handling of the Korean War by General Douglas MacArthur and some of his subordinate commanders, most notably Ned Almond. Halberstam also neatly chronicles the errors of political leaders in the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China and the Soviet Union that led to the Korean War and continued it well past when the fighting became a useless stalemate.<br /><br />Halberstam neatly chronicles events on the ground in Korea but frustratingly spends long chapters away from the battlefield discussing events in China. If you're looking strictly for a military history of the war this is not the book for you. Nor is it the book for you if you're looking for a balanced portrayal of General MacArthur, Ned Almond and MacArthur's intelligence officer Charles Willoughby. The way Halberstam tells this story MacArthur was not only incompetent but delusional as well and guys like Almond and Willoughby should have been court martialed and jailed for their incompetence. Halberstam does support each portrayal with a long litany of facts and incidents, but one does kind of get a feeling that, like all good writers, in order to \\"hook\\" a reader in to a story he needed a villain and he found several. After MacArthur's recall by President Truman the book moves quickly through the rest of the war.<br /><br />The end of the book is, in my opinion, a disaster. It felt like Halberstam didn't know where to end it so he just kept writing. The reader is treated to chapters on the two Koreas since the Korean War and chapters on Kennedy, Johnson and Vietnam that seem out of place. Halberstam should have cut those chapters out and ended with the chapter that discusses the experience since the war of some of the veterans Halberstam interviewed for the book. The quotes by veterans who lived through each battle detailed by Halberstam are what really make this book worth reading and the fate of the surviving veterans is quite interesting.<br /><br />This is a good starting point to get interested in the Korean War but it should not be treated as a good general overall history of the war.veterans who lived through each battle detailed by Halberstam are what really make this book worth reading and the fate of the surviving veterans is quite interesting.<br /><br />This is a good starting point to get interested in the Korean War but it should not be treated as a good general overall history of the war.
1609611543|5.0|There's little I can add that you won't find detailed in the personal anecdotes of other _Wheat Belly_ reviews. Suffice it to say that I found this book credible, cogent, persuasive, and truly terrifying. I have two boys, 7 and 10, and if even half -- no. If even 20% of what Davis says in this book is accurate (and I suspect the number is closer to the 85-95% range), then the severity and significance of what we have been doing to our children and ourselves cannot be understated.<br /><br />I finished listening to the audio version of _Wheat Belly_ a few minutes ago. (The narration is quite good, by the way.) I wasn't even half-way through the book, though, before I was telling my wife all about it and we'd decided to start transitioning our children away from wheat. It won't be easy. We went low-carb a year ago, so the move is less drastic for us. But when you consider all of the snacks, pizza parties, school lunches, and everything else we'll have to train them to deal with...it's daunting to say the least.<br /><br />My boys have a hard time focusing in school. For that matter, I have a hard time focusing on work. We blow such things off. \\"Oh, they're just boys. Oh, it's just middle age.\\" But they also have serious allergies. They also come from family lines riddled with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and so on. What's more important? Giving them the habits that will help them toward a healthier, longer, more productive life...or having them fit in with the tasty yet destructive habits of their peers. We rail against the dangers of drugs, never knowing that we have been feeding them one of the most insidious, deleterious, addictive drugs of all with every meal since they were old enough to chew.<br /><br />Dr. Davis has set my family on a difficult road, but I view it as a mission, perhaps even a quest, and the prize at the end is not to suffer the same terrible fates as my parents and grandparents. In a way, eliminating wheat is a bit like eliminating carbon emissions. Yes, it's hard. Yes, it costs more. But in the end, even if the \\"theory\\" of human-exacerbated climate change is dead wrong, what's the worst that could happen? We have cleaner air and a host of more efficient manufacturing technologies in play. Same thing here. At the very worst, wheat elimination will leave me leaner and healthier. It may not prevent cancer, stave off Alzheimer's, and thwart diabetes. Then again, as Dr. Davis so thoroughly details, just maybe it will.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually review books so this isn't a 'professional' review.  But \\"Wool\\" just blew me away.  I found myself hiding the Kindle under my desk and reading at work. I put down my knitting (yes,of wool)just to find out what happened next and who, if anyone, was going to Make It Through.  The pace is fast, the writing is tense and kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />This is not a far-fetched, sci-fi story line.  As the back-story unfolds, I found myself nodding that YES,this COULD happen.<br />As soon as I took a long-held breath at the end of the last page of Book 5, I went back and ordered \\"Book 6- First Shift- Legacy\\".<br />If Amazon didn't require at least 20 words, I could have stopped at \\"WOW!\\".

B008NB0SQO|1.0|My sincere apologies Disney Corporation, but I will not purchase nor will I give a positive review to this film without \\"The Love Is Gone\\" being included in the film.  This film is a solid Four Stars, perhaps even Five Stars, in its entirety.  Nevertheless, this will not do and should be, for Heaven's sake, \\"re-released\\" in its entirety.
