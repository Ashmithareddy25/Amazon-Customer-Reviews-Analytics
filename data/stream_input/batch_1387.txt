B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a complete waste of money.  I tried really hard to finish it (because I had spent so much money on it), but it was so boring and repetitive, I couldn't go on.<br />I can't believe there are another two books!  I won't be wasting my money on them.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|THE AFFAIR is not only a great story, packed with mystery, suspense and action, but it is the prelude and foundation to Child's future books on Reacher.<br /><br />The story is set in 1997 when Reacher is sent undercover to a small town in Mississippi where three young women have been murdered. The Army wants to cover its ass because of the nearby military base that stations an elite Ranger unit. Us Reacher fans are all familiar with how he buys a shirt and discards the old one, and the famous compact toothbrush. In this story, legacy and habits of Reacher unfolds that we recognize in subsequent books.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book that is a must read for Reacher fans as it explains why he mustered out of the Army and became a drifter. Highly recommended.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|So, a one star is pretty harsh.<br /><br />Especially considering that I still use the G13, and aside from the Nostromo (before Razer took it over), it's the best out there of its kind. Fortunately for Logitech there aren't many companies bothering to design these types of keypads.<br /><br />It's made well enough. No complaints regarding the build quality.<br /><br />The problems lay in the design.<br /><br />I don't know who designed the thumb stick, but if you don't replace it yourself (which requires taking the device apart, or gluing/sanding) it's just terrible as a AWSD input. Anyways, I would fire the designer of it. He clearly is not good. Even the five star reviews will tell you that.<br /><br />The LCD is a gimmick. I don't know what else to say about it. The only reason you'll probably use it is to swap profiles, which I'll mention in the next part.<br /><br />The software is terrible. Sometimes you'll have to program the device every time you boot up, because the file won't save correctly. Even worse is that it will sometimes revert back to an older setting, or lose a profile, months after you thought it finally was working.<br /><br />So, what does this all mean. Well, because the Nostromo is no longer as good as it once was, we're pretty much stuck with the G13. On the other hand, Logitech did a terrible job on it, considering the price point. It's basically a bunch of keys, a worthless LCD screen, a terrible joystick, and bad software to make it worse.<br /><br />Hopefully a competitor will go into this niche field and design something better. Logitech is obviously more interested in making it look fancy, than having it work well.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br /><br />Well, at the time of this editing \\"0 of 7 people found this review helpful.\\" It's possible that all of them work at Logitech; who knows. I've adjusted the review to now be 3 stars, mostly because I was probably a little overly harsh. The fact is, I still own and use my G13. It's not perfect,especially considering the price point for what is essentially a mini keyboard with a silly LCD and bad joystick, but it's still the best product in the niche field (once modified by the owner). That said, if Razer goes back to the quality of the original Nostromo produced by Belkin, then I will be switching brands.
B0054JELS4|4.0|Product is great.  All new?  Into season 3, so far, only found one fault, 2 of the discs in Season 1 were mislabeled. But we figured it out and switched them around (not the labels the discs in the box)and watched them in order.  For the price, not complaining. Don't know if it is a manufacturing glitch. . . or what.  Overall was happy with product, vendor and Amazon.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I wrote a review on \\"A night to remember\\" and said it was better than this movie, I still stand by that statement.  Here's why, do you have to have fictional characters in an historical movie to connect with your audience, NO. A night to remember had you invested in all the characters involved, even the drunk baker. Which was historically accurate, but here. Cameron seems to think that a movie about an historical event must have fictional characters, point number two. There is no way on God's green earth, that a steerage passenger would have been allowed up in the first class area to rescue Rose, the code of conduct was so strict between classes. As accurately portrayed in \\"S.O.S Titanic\\" when second class passenger Lawrence Beesley asked his friend about joining the third class passengers in a deck game, to which the friend replied it wouldn't be proper. While the sets and costumes looked good, this movie lacked substance. I actually liked the made for T.V movie with Catherine Zeta Jones, over this crap. My only problem with that movie is the rape scene, this movie tried to put 21st century dialouge and actions into a world that it doesn't fit. For instance, while yes Molly Brown was rich. She was looked on as grudgingly accepted by her class, but only because of her money. The people who blindly accept this movie, also overlook the fact, that a woman in 1912. Never spoke back to her husband, in fact they never spoke unless spoken to first. A wife stood by her husband in that time period, no matter how he treated her, because he was the head of his house no questions asked. That's why, when Molly Brown took over the life boat in real life, well Molly Brown herself contradicted the whole code of the first class. Just like when John Jacob Astor married his second wife, it wasn't that she was so young. But that he had just divorced his first wife, and on his second honeymoon his second wife is pregnant. He was actually ostracised by the first class for that, this movie failed in a big way. No had it been a fictional ship, then maybe, but history and class are against this movie, even if Jack had been able to rescue rose the first time. He most certainly would not have been able to passed off as a first class passenger, no matter how hard they tried. This movie tried to look at the tradgedy through modern day eyes, and it doesn't work. I was more involved in the characters, because they were actually there. I'm sorry, but you don't need a fictional couple to tell the story of the Titanic.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|This was not what I was expecting.  I did not realize that this only zipped on two sides. It does have a slight odor about it but I didn't find it harsh or offensive.  Overall it's a nice little pouch for your Kindle Fire to rest in when not in use.  I would probably wait until the price was closer to the $15-20 mark too.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Like I've said many times, it's easy to look at some movies from the future. I too remember when this movie came out in 94', the concept had never been done before. A bus has a bomb on it, if it goes below 50 miles per hour. Well then BOOM, but jack Traven played by Keanu Reeves is on the scene. Having foiled the bombers previous attempt to get his ransom money, he's now after Jack, I think what some people don't realize is, there are some movies that are just meant to be over the top. For example, one reviewers ripped this movie apart but praised \\"Diehard\\". But what that person failed to realize is, would a visiting police officer all by himself be able to take down an entire group of Terrorists, as John Mcclain did In Diehard. The answer to that is no, but we still watch it and enjoy it. Same with \\"Speed\\", plus Keanu isn't made to do too much in this movie. Sandra Bullock gives a solid performance in supporting role, and Dennis Hopper steals this movie, playing the bomber in an over the top manner. Perfect for a mindless action movie, I do not know about rewrites. But I can tell you, the way the movie is now is better than it could have been. After hardly meeting Harry, played by Jeff Daniels. In the begining of the movie, I never would have bought him as the bomber. And yes, those bus cameras are better than people think they are, or were, Particularly when Payne realizes what Jack did to the camera. It zooms in on Annie's jacket, and you can recognize the Wildcat logo. For a friday night, or saturday popcorn movie, I recommend it.

This is my first time reading a book by Sam Harris, and I enjoyed this work and look forward to his others. Fans of his debating and speaking style will also appreciate his precise, elegant and accessible writing style. The book is apparently short compared to his best-known works, but it's not short on evidence and solid examples that defend his claim. And while you'll likely be left wanting more, it's not more proof you'll want, just more of this man's compelling thoughts on this fascinating topic.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed Erin Morgenstern's book so much I felt the need to encourage others to read it. Those who enjoy mystery, magic, exotic backdrops and a touching love story, will enjoy this book. It is a romantic, modern day fairy tale with elements of a gothic novel.<br /><br />The tale is inhabited by characters that possess extraordinary and quite surprising abilities. Their relationships, how they use their skills and to what end, are part of the magic and beauty of the book. Getting lost in the magnificently detailed descriptions of an extraordinary - living - circus, is the other part.<br /><br />Word to the wise: on the surface, this book may appear to be light reading. I suggest it is not. It can be puzzling at times which I found added to its mystique. Pay attention to the details and clues and \\"wait for it\\". The pieces do come together, wonderfully.<br /><br />I'm an avid reader and I haven't found a book this engaging and intriguing in a very long time.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book was truly marvelous, even better than the first.<br /><br />A thing to keep in mind when undertaking the reading of The Name of the Wind or The Wise Man's Fear is that these are not your everyday fantasy novels. Throughout these two books, much emphasis is given to the idea of a well-told story. The characters regularly tell each other stories, and Kvothe in particular prides himself on being an excellent story-teller.<br /><br />Kvothe's story, as told in The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear, is much like many of the stories told by the characters within. It is a beautiful tale that encourages you to enjoy the journey, instead of focusing only on the end goal. Most books are highways, straight and true, with perhaps a bit of character development from side to side along the way. The Wise Man's Fear is a path through the mountains; it meanders. But there's definitely more to see as you travel, and if you're suited for the journey, it's loads more exciting than a boring old highway.<br /><br />Kvothe's goal is to find the Chandrian, but unfortunately for Kvothe, the Chandrian are a great mystery. So while the end goal remains the same throughout, we witness Kvothe's life as it progresses. And Kvothe has a very interesting life, including adventure upon adventure, and resulting in Kvothe's ultimate notoriety.<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear includes masterful characterization and many many stories within the story. As Kvothe seeks the Chandrian, he repeatedly runs into trouble. His sharp and curious mind encourage him to learn, while also encouraging him to shoot his mouth off imprudently at inopportune moments.<br /><br />If you're looking for your typical novel in which the protagonist makes noticeable strides toward his goal at every turn, then this may not be the story for you. On the other hand, if you are a true lover of stories, and you might enjoy a beautifully told tale of a marvelously fascinating young man who meets a new adventure at everyturn, then read this book right away!<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear has earned a place as one of my favorites.
B000002U6E|3.0|I am Amazed that Enigma does not give credit to Klaus Schulze (the godfather of electronic music) or Pink Floyd (the godfathers of sykedelyk music) in most of their compositions.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R.R. Martin must be a fascinating guy. Between all the incest and the lack of qualms when it comes to the killing or injuring of well-liked characters, this guy is downright heartless . . . or just really imaginative and true to his vision! I do not recommend reading this book if you are one of those people who expects your favorite characters to eventually find happiness. There is no happiness here.<br /><br />On the other hand, A Game of Thrones was astoundingly good. The writing style was phenomenal. Even the word choices gave me a feeling of being in a another time or place, in which knights battle to the death in their highly-ornamented suits of armor, while dragons and zombies fight their own battles in other parts of the world. I felt the icy cold of the Wall, the warm cold of home in Winterfell, and the heartless warmth of King's Landing. I think it might be hard not to feel something while reading A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I didn't understand the title before I picked up the book, but after having finished the book, I have to admit that the title is perfection. As the book opens, there is at least one conspiracy to take the throne. As the book progresses, it becomes unclear to various characters who has a right to the throne. Various houses and groups rally around leaders, and in the end, there appear to be a number of claims to a number of thrones. It's a marvelous game the players play, a game of thrones!<br /><br />After I read a book, I usually have an opinion about characterization of the main character. In A Game of Thrones, there are many main characters, and each one is beautifully characterized. I understand every one's motivations and desires. I know what drives them, and I desperately want them all to achieve their aims.<br /><br />As a side note: I almost gave this book four stars. Frankly, Daenerys's apparent partial loss of her sanity (in my opinion) toward the end of the book threw me for quite a loop. The last few Dany chapters were just odd. And unfortunately, they were so close to the end of the book that I didn't have much chance to let go of the bad taste they left in mouth. So I initially planned to give this book four stars. But after taking several minutes to reflect, I felt the need to come back and change this star-rating to five stars, as it should be.re just odd.

B003K16P3M|4.0|I had a hard time deciding whether to give this book four or five stars. I definitely enjoyed Graceling more than every other book that I have rated a four so far this year. I wish I could give it four and half stars, but alas, this is not allowed.<br /><br />The story of Graceling takes place in a world where some people are Graced with special abilities. The main character Katsa is a Graceling whose special ability is killing/surviving. At the beginning of the book, Katsa is a reluctant enforcer for her king. But Katsa also leads a Council that seeks to right wrongdoings throughout the seven kingdoms. Early in the book, Katsa meets Po, who is Graced with what appears to be a special ability at fighting. Katsa and Po set out to investigate the kidnapping of Po's grandfather.<br /><br />I adore the idea of Graces. Even more so, I adore the idea that, even though a Graceling is identified by the different-colored eyes, the Grace (i.e., the specific special ability) itself may remain a mystery.<br /><br />I initially hesitated to pick up this book because I read a few reviews claiming that Katsa is a raging bi-yatch. I strongly disagree with that assessment. Katsa is definitely demanding. But in my opinion, a lot of her snappishness toward the beginning of the book was the result of her trying to convince herself that she didn't need friends. It is well-known that Katsa's Grace is killing, so people generally avoid her. The book is in Katsa's perspective, and based on her thoughts, it appeared that she really does care and she really does seek love and friendship. I sympathized with her and did not at all find her to be bitchy. To the contrary, I found her to be respectably flawed despite being a serious butt-kicker.<br /><br />I love Po, especially toward the beginning of the book. When Katsa is just getting to know him, there is ample description of his appearance (especially his eyes) and about how completely kick-ass he is. Unfortunately, as the book progressed, Itired of Katsa beating him during trainings. Po described himself as being humble, but I thought some more cockiness might have made him sexier. I would have liked to see him put Katsa in her place when she was in one of her controlling moods. But in the end, I did enjoy watching him take full advantage of his Grace--even though he never did kick Katsa's ass with it.<br /><br />I can't say too much about the bad guy, because I don't want to give his/her identity away. But let me just say: Bad Guy's Grace is really awesome, and I wish I could have seen it in action a lot more.<br /><br />There are two primary reasons that I do not give this book five stars: (1) An unreasonably large portion of the book was dedicated to the hard journey to and from a distant kingdom. Boooooring! In general, I prefer that authors do a lot more \\"show\\" than \\"tell,\\" but this was over-doing it in my opinion. And (2) Katsa and Po deduce an extremely important piece of super-secret information based on a teeny tiny clue. I remain unconvinced that any two people would take the fortuitous leap of logic that they take. But of course, their conclusion is correct and leads to discovery of the Bad Guy.<br /><br />The biggest problem that I have with this book does not affect my rating, because it did not affect my enjoyment of the book. However, as this is supposedly a young adult book, this bothers me quite a bit: The institution of marriage gets a seriously bad rap. We see three relationships related to marriage in Graceling: (1) Po's parents, the king and queen of Lienid, (2) Katsa and Po, and (3) Bad Guy and his/her spouse. (1) The Lienid king and queen appear to have a great, loving relationship with many children, and the Lienid king is a good and fair ruler. Despite this, his queen keeps an important secret from him in fear that the king with treat his son badly if he learns the truth. Everyone who learns the truth appears to agree with the queen's decision. So their marriage can't be allthat great, if the queen is protecting her son from his own father. (2) Katsa refuses to marry because, in her opinion, even if her husband does not attempt to control her, any freedom that she would have as a married lady would be allowed only at the whim of her husband. Katsa's position on this matter is never disputed throughout the book, and her mind does not appear to change even after she and Po fall in love. The book appears to suggest that living together as lovers forever is preferred to marriage. I'm not saying that marriage should be a goal of everyone, but I disapprove of this book being pitched as young adult book, all the while sending the message that a life as unmarried lovers is preferable to marriage. (3) Of course, I cannot go into the issue of Bad Guy's marriage, but let's just say it is a bad situation.<br /><br />Despite my issues with the book, I really enjoyed it. And I will definitely read the sequel.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this was a very poorly written book with no plot! I skipped pages at a time and it didnt matter. I cannot believe the hype on this book and I'm very sorry I fell for it! What a waste of time!
0765356139|4.0|To sum up my feelings about this book: It was really good, . . . but I am disappointed.<br /><br />I admit that it may be unfair of me to be disappointed. Brandon Sanderson has simply set the bar too high in the previous books of his that I have read. I now think of Sanderson as an author who writes phenomenal, mind-blowing endings, and in my opinion, The Well of Ascension simply did not fit that mold.<br /><br />Sanderson added a good deal more supernatural-ness in The Well of Ascension than there was in Mistborn. There were blue monsters, religious prophesies, and a new Allomatic metal that essentially made Vin super-powered (as if she were not super already). It was a lot--perhaps too much.<br /><br />My primary complaint about the book was Vin. Vin was still trying to figure out who she is and was trying to make her peace with being the significant other to a king while also being a Mistborn killing machine. Her most difficult struggles were internal. Externally, she kicked ass all day, all night, and all the time. Frankly, I got a tad bored with watching Vin kick ass. When Vin was around, her friends were safe. Vin would win the fight with some injury to herself, but no one important would die when Vin was present. Eventually, I started to think: \\"Okay, I get it. She is powerful.\\" I would have liked to see her fail at protecting someone.<br /><br />Now that I've complained, please note that my rating for this book is four stars. So I really did like it a lot. Allomancy is still a brilliant concept. Sanderson is still a brilliant writer. Elend is a fantastic character, as are Ham and Breeze. Elend's transformation from a scholar into a king was believable, as was his internal struggle regarding his relationship with a powerful Mistborn. I greatly enjoyed getting to know Breeze better; he's a good man who does not want to appear as though he cares about others as much as he does. I also really enjoyed the introduction of a second kandra (i.e., a being that can take the body of a deceased other being). I did not predict how that was going to turn out!<br /><br />I look forward to reading the next book, which I hope clears up some of my issues with this one.
B0055Q5F36|2.0|Purchased this case with a used phone or I would not have bought this case. I liked the Otterbox case on my dad's iPhone 3GS - that thing is indestructible. This case is solidly built, however it has several major design flaws that makes it worth less than more $1.29 TPU cases on eBay.<br /><br />Screen protection - the rubber at the bottom two corners peels back if this case is dropped at the wrong angle, allowing the screen to break. In comparison, I have dropped the phone onto concrete using a TPU case that landed screen first and it survived without a scratch.<br /><br />Grip - this case is slippery. It uses hard plastic with little texture to prevent the phone from slipping. It gets even worse if your hands get sweaty from worrying about dropping a $400 phone!<br /><br />I honestly believe you are better off buying a $1.29 case that is less expensive, less bulky, interferes less with the screen, is free of branding, protects the screen better and has better grip.<br /><br />As an aside, Amazon's review system rewards helpful reviews, which inevitably are going to be the more positive reviews. However, nothing is perfect. I write reviews to give my experience and honest opinion on products - not for some contest.

B002GYI9C4|5.0|Mistborn is a truly super-awesome and fantastic book, with the masterful sort of ending that I have come to expect from the genius that is Brandon Sanderson!<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, we meet Vin, a street urchin just trying to survive as a member of an oppressed socio-economic class. One of the ways that Vin survives is by using what she thinks of as her \\"Luck.\\" Her use of luck is detected by some very bad guys, as well as by some questionable guys.<br /><br />Among these questionable guys is Kelsier, who brings Vin in as part of his thieving crew and explains that her Luck is simply one of the eight basic forms of Allomancy. Allomancy is the burning of various Allomantic metals, where each metal provides an associated ability to the person burning it. \\"Mistings\\" can burn exactly one basic Allomantic metals, and \\"Mistborns\\" can burn all Allomantic metals, which includes a few additional metals on top of the basic eight. Vin and Kelsier are Mistborn, and various other members of their crew are Mistings.<br /><br />The Lord Ruler is a mysterious god-like bad guy who oppresses everybody, especially the lower class, while asserting his rule. So of course, Kelsier and Vin seek to bring down the Lord Ruler and pretty much the entire government, all the while being hunted for the abilities.<br /><br />One of things I adored about this book is that we, the reader, get to learn all about Allomancy and how metal-burning works, as Kelsier breaks it down for Vin. So in a beautiful, non-contrived manner, we are introduced to the magic system.<br /><br />The characterization in the book was great. I understood Vin and Kelsier. Vin is stubborn survivor trying to find her place in the world, and Kelsier wants vengeance and justice for his wife's death. The Lord Ruler has his own super-secret motivations that remain a mystery as the book comes to a close. I can't wait to read about this in the later books! I really hated (i.e., the way a reader should hate the bad guy) the Lord Ruler and his minions, who were pretty freakin scary. I think further development of the other crew members would have been nice, but maybe I'll see more of them in the later books of this trilogy.<br /><br />Throughout a great deal of the book, the crew is working their \\"job,\\" which is a multi-layer plan to give themselves a fair shot at taking out Lord Ruler. In the end, some parts of the plan succeed and some fail miserably. Despite the failures, the crew members forge ahead against the Lord Ruler . . . whom they have no idea how to kill.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|When I first read that they were making this movie I had my misgivings on how it would translate to the big screen. Within five minutes, I had my answer. Besides saying this is the finest Marval Comics movie, it is, but it is also a stand alone epic movie that surprised everyone in the industry on how well it was received. The worst part was waiting for the blue ray to be released so I could watch it when ever I wanted. The casting was wonderful and it was like the characters jumped from the two dimentional comic to the big screen. Not only was the movie well scripted and cast, it also served as a life lesson of how one lives their life and how they can change for the better. This was a fine message for all ages. My greatest fear, same with Avatar, is a follow up sequel and how many times they do not live up to the opriginal. As much as I want more, I also feel a let down if the second movie can't stand up to the original.

0805209999|5.0|The thing I love about Kafka is how theatrical his style is. He creates these series of grotesquely humorous tableaux, and then steps back and lets the reader make what they will of them. Reading The Trial I felt I could perfectly picture each scene as though I was watching a film, and there's something about this sort of cold objectivity which, when other authors use it, feels secure and safe, but when Kafka does it, feels charged with anxiety and some unspoken menace that's always looming just around the next corner. It reminds me of Gogol's writings more than anything else, where you see the superstitious, old Europe clashing with the malaise-inducing bureaucracy brought about by the new Europe

Will try the Beast next and see if that is what he needs.  Note:  He does like the Mizuno Renegade, just wish they came in black.
0062068423|5.0|Introducing Harry Hole, police investigator, fresh off from some debacle in his career while in Australia.  We now find Harry back in Oslo, stuck doing rather mundane stuff to stay out of trouble. Luckily he has a good partner, who helps keep him from sinking into depression and alcoholism.<br /><br />But while on routine surveillance, Harry has another mishap, and is kicked upstairs to the Security Service (the POT)  instead of out of the force.  There, he's stuck reading reports of various cases to see which need further followup. What is uncovered is twofold: a ring operating in Norway, bringing in some high powered weapons, and the killing of WWII veterans who were on the Eastern Front in a dark time of Norway's history.<br /><br />The story is told in two threads: a backstory in WWII and present day.  The way the author weaves them together is fabulous -- almost as good as the characters he introduces us to. There is a section of calls Harry made to Ellen that was among the most poignant writing I've read in a long time.<br /><br />I was warned that this series is one to definitely read in order, and I shall.  Next on the list is [[ASIN:B001NLKZ64 Nemesis (Harry Hole)]].  Be sure to read up on Jo Nesbø, as he's got an interesting background.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I'm reading the book on my Kindle Fire so haven't completed it, but it really is surprising to learn what Steve Jobs was really like.  From all the Apple info over the years, the man, Steve Jobs, was not the kind of person I thought he was.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|My whole family really enjoyed this movie, and it is action-packed, so there's no question of boredom. It centers on Puss in Boots, the character Antoinio Banderas made famous in the Shrek movies. A friend/nemesis from his past (Humpty-Dumpty) re-enters his life, along with a new romantic interest played by Selma Hayak, and they attempt to steal a goose that lays golden eggs. Like Shrek, it's full of fairy-tale references and 'inside' jokes that play more to adults than kids, although kids love the action. I didn't find it quite as funny as the Shrek movies though - maybe because there's no Eddie Murphy/donkey sidekick to lighten things up. Certain parts were also a little mean-spirited - lots of fighting in this movie. But other than that, it's very enjoyable and well-executed family fare.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I saw this on network TV and I am anxiously waiting for my Breaking Bad Season 4 DVD. This will complete my entire Breaking Bad Collection.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are simple and easy to play. I played while on a bus tour and it really helped the time fly.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I can not say enough about how pleased I was to see this movie. I was expecting it to be good and it was better than that. Kate has brought this series back with a bang. Being color blind and not having seen a 3D movie forever I didn't know what to expect, wow it was a blast. The action was nonstop, the new stars were great. My wife who normally never would watch any of these went with me and her comment was, this movie rocked. Enough said.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I would have liked it better, but for my search on books, products and for seeing couple of reviews in a store this is good. I prefer to browse on my computer/laptop as I don't have a tablet now. This probably is better for tablet use. Much better than website on android. So Giving 4 stars.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I did not have a lot of money left over, but wanted a cheap gaming computer. So I chose this CPU and several other parts. I already had a HD, OS and screen, so my total price came to just under $400. My new computer runs very fast and runs most games at high quality, I know it runs Portal 2 and TF2 at very high quality with no lag. And runs Minecraft easily. It was easily installed and came with thermal paste. This CPU scored just under a friend's 27 inch iMac that has a i3 in it and cost over $3000. This CPU scored 5570 via Geekbench, the iMac scored 5550. Overall, it is a great CPU for the price it is.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I complete all levels when I had a 7\\" tablet in 2010. It was very addictive and I completed in 3 weeks.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|All of his books were spell-binding; could not put them down.  Devoting a whole<br />chapter to each major (and some minor characters) kept the book moving along at a fast<br />clip.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|very addictive! When I'm playing I don't even notice how long I've been on and end up playing for hours. I love the variety of game types and levels of difficulty. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because every now and then the game tends to freeze and then I don't get the points for that round.

B00123KEPK|5.0|Since it's release in, I believe Jan of 1974, and seeing Yes perform this live in Feb of that year, this album has been my favorite Yes album!  And always will be.  Yes at their progressive and artistic best!!
0316056871|2.0|I guess I had expected more from this book.  Reads like a 'write a book for a book deal offer' rather then anything substantial. Considering she is a comedy writer, the book falls flat.  Although there are a dozen wonderful quotes, in between those great lines is dead air.  Love her, but she should have waited for a book deal when she had something to say.  I feel she phoned this one to the bank.

B004E2XAHK|5.0|When I first listened to this CD, The Unforgiving, I had been drenching myself in the older stuff. THIS is not THAT, and like a child who is not given it's favorite ice cream, I rebelled.<br /><br />This great band deserved more than a temper tantrum from me.<br /><br />I watched the movies, and found myself moved. Emotion is the foundation of my love or dislike of all things ART. I moved closer and decided these, my old metal bones, were being foolish and trite. God I can be such a fuddy duddy.<br /><br />I gave The Unforgiving another chance: I tasted, swirled it around in my heart, tried again and let the sounds drip through my brain and, LO! I found that I actually liked it.<br /><br />Soon I was addicted to the best drug of them all: great emotive music created to move and stir the soul.<br /><br />The Unforgiving shakes the soul! The stories and songs hit close to home, to embrace them is to feel a catharsis--a liberation and a purging. It's gritty, it's knee shaking moving, it brings that tension in the chest that causes the sternest of men to belt it down; there's no room for tears shed for the downtrodden, the misfits and misfornates who dare fight for redemption... or is there?<br /><br />The Unforgiving passed my ultimate test: does it cause in earthquake in my soul, disorient my compass and cause me to see life in a whole new exilerating way: Hell Yeah!<br /><br />Great music can be as hard to create as it can be to listen to if one is afraid of being fully human. Another year and another test passed, it never gets easier only more fulfilling.<br /><br />Thanks Within Temptation!

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I have loved this book it is a complete page turner, this is a magnificient Trilogy (the Girl with the Dragon Tatto) took me a little bit to get into but after that they have kept me up at nights
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First, I loved the first two books. The first half of this book is great and keeps you captivated just like the first two books. However (I am attempting to be vague in order to not spoil the book), it seems that this book drags on a bit. Also some other deaths are buried in the middle of chapters and it seems as though their deaths are insignificant. Then the end seems a bit rushed. All-in-all, I am glad that I read this book and I loved the series!
B005K2KCPG|3.0|Im a huge Chickenfoot fan, would love to give this albulm an excellent review, but there were just too many slow songs on it. Im not sayin its a bad buy, its not the fast rockin music like the first albulm. Hopefully they will make up for it on the next one, this ones just not my style.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when I thought that the Hunger Games could get any better, I read Catching Fire. Without spoiling anything, this is a MUST read if you loved book 1. This book had many surprises and unexpected twists, and the end leaves you thirsting for more!

0061689246|2.0|This is my first Gaiman book.  I picked up because I had heard such great things about him as an author, and he has received many awards and praise over the last half-decade or so.  I was surprised then by how little this book moved me.<br /><br />The book isn't bad, but rather it's just bland.  There weren't many descriptions of the environment (though I understand that this originally was meant as a graphic novel, so I suppose that should account for part of it).  The story is just chock-full of two-dimensional characters.  Really, though, the parts I found weakest were the relationships between the characters.  I found it difficult to believe that Tristan and Yvaine were in love with one another by the end.  There wasn't much dialogue between the two of them that would convince me of this, and nothing about their behavior towards one another would give much indication either.  Rather, I just feel like I was told by Gaiman near the end that they now are in love with one another rather than being shown in any shape or form.  There was just no emotion from any of the characters.  When Tristan finally learns that his mother isn't his biological one, we get no reaction from him.  When he finally meets his real mother, again no reaction.  It's like he's made of wood.<br /><br />There were a few things I did like.  The concept of Fairie land, a magical place not bound by the normal laws of physics that govern our world, is just across a wall from our world.  If not for the guards, one could simply cross into one land from the other when he so chose.  (The rest of this paragraph contains SPOILERS! - read at your own discretion) I also like how it did not end in a typical fantasy fashion.  There is no epic showdown between the hero and the enemy (or enemies).  The witch, for example, is defeated in a more ironical fashion - she ends up much older and more frail than how she had started out (End of SPOILERS!)<br /><br />I will say that although the movie made the ending more hollywood/Tolkien-esque, the film overall was far more enjoyable.  It had that 'magical' feeling to it, with memorable characters, believable relationships, and flat-out fun.<br /><br />I do plan to give Gaiman another shot.  I have obtained copies of American Gods and Neverwhere, and will make a firmer judgment then.  I understand that this one of his earlier works, and that it was meant to be coupled with some beautiful illustrations.  I hope to be more impressed with his other works.re hollywood/Tolkien-esque, the film overall was far more enjoyable.

031286504X|4.0|I Am Legend is a collection of stories, the longest of which - taking up roughly half the book - is the story I Am Legend, upon which the Will Smith movie was (extraordinarily loosely) based.<br /><br />I was especially intrigued by this novel after seeing a raving quote from Dean Koontz on the front and one from Stephen King on the back. It was definitely a solidly good read, if short of fantastic. Matheson has a talent for word craft, and a rich, dark imagination. The reader will benefit greatly from both, and find themselves thoroughly frightened, horrified, and entertained. It's interesting that even though some of these stories were written as long ago as 1952, for the most part they don't feel dated at all and could well have been written today.<br /><br />I did have one issue with the book, which is that many of the stories are vignettes with little or no resolution or clarification. I personally enjoy stories that end.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|Another Oscar nominee was released this week and Steven Spielberg's first foray into motion capture technology, The Adventures of Tintin. An animated 3D spectacle, Tintin is based on a series of classic Belgian comics bearing the same title, and features a young journalist and his faithful dog sidekick Snowy as they travel the globe in search of a sunken treasure from the 17th Century. Featuring an all-star voice cast that includes Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, Tintin can be compared to an earlier Spielberg franchise starring a certain treasure-hunting Archaeology professor by the name of \\"Indiana,\\" which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Fortunately, I look at it as a good thing, it's a nice little animated throwback to classic adventure serials with some serious visuals to boot.

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Back in 2006, WB had a hit with Happy Feet, an animated film about an emperor penguin named Mumble who couldn't sing worth a lick, but who could tap dance his tail off. Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik, who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven, a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son's respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was worth  watching and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, I wasn't too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, its is narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation is expectedly top notch. It's not terrible, but it won't be taking home any awards either.
0446563048|4.0|It doesn't take long reading into Delivering Happiness when Tony Hsieh has you giggling over his antics as a kid. It charms you into his success stories...which he has many (along with some failures) that started with a button making business as a kid making $200/month. As Mr. Hsieh shows you the pathway to his Zappos success story, he share advice to help you to succeed too. The mix of humor and his style of writing keeps the book moving along and interesting to read. Delivering Happiness is one of the better books of this type that I actually enjoyed reading...and made me envious that I don't work for Zappos.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|We kick off this week with an Oscar-winner, made by and starring previous Oscar-winners, and though The Descendants only took home one of the five trophies for which it was nominated, most still agree it's a thoughtful drama worth watching. Best Actor nominee George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii about to complete a significant family real estate deal when his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her in a coma with no hope of waking. With his wife now hospitalized and on the verge of passing, Matt must reconnect with their two daughters, come to terms with the fact that his wife was unfaithful to him, and decide whether or not to go through with the land sale. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and directed by Academy Award-winner Alexander Payne, The Descendants is funny, moving, and beautifully acted. Shailene Woodley, playing Matt's older daughter, also deserves kudos and the supporting cast is solid all-around.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|Michelle Wiliams sure has come a long way since her days on network television. The former Dawson's Creek star has come into her own, and her feature film career of late has proven her to be an indie movie darling, with acclaimed roles in films like Wendy and Lucy and Blue Valentine. Her latest is a turn as iconic starlet Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, a profile of the week she spent with filmmaker Colin Clark, fresh out of college on his first movie gig as an assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier on 1957's The Prince and the Showgirl. The nuanced portrayal of the Hollywood legend earned Williams her third Oscar nomination, and Kenneth Branagh earned his second for acting, though neither took home the statue. My Week with Marilyn is worth seeing, if only for the fantastic performances.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I love this book. Well it`s not as good as Angels and Demons or the Da Vinci Code, those are unfair expectations. Dan Brown wrote Digital Fortress before those two, so it makes sense that it isn`t as good, but still, this a super exciting book that I finished in one sitting because it was so great. It has all the plot twists and great storytelling of Dan Brown`s 4 other great books.
B006P0FIGU|1.0|Paul W.S. Anderson's name isn't exactly synonymous with what one might call \\"quality cinema;\\" despite the fact that the Resident Evil franchise has gained a cult following, he has never been behind the camera of a movie that I liked. So it was no surprise that his rock 'em, sock 'em 3D update of Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers was not very good; even the Oscar-winning talent of Christoph Waltz could do little to save it. The story, pretty much recycled and beefed up with big action sequences and CGI, is familiar: Brash, young D'artagnan must team up with the titular trio to take down the scheming Cardinal Richelieu, who has disbanded the musketeers. Throw in a big supporting cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich, Juno Temple, Til Schweiger and more, and one would think it had a chance. Unfortunately, Anderson's The Three Musketeers has nothing new to set it apart from the long line of adaptations that preceded it, yet executed what it did have so poorly that it isn't worth watching. In other words, almost any other version is probably better than this one.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Although its used its in great condition and my daughter really enjoys watching it. I would definetly recommend this movie.
B005FITIK0|4.0|Jason Reitman's got quite the streak going. After Thank You for Smoking in 2005, Reitman proved he wasn't a one-hit wonder by earning Academy love for his next two films, Juno and Up in the Air. In his latest effort, Young Adult, Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, a selfish, self-absorbed former prom queen-turned-writer who returns to her hometown in hopes of winning back her happily married high school sweetheart, instead reconnecting with a former classmate she barely remembers. Working from a script by Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody, Young Adult drummed up a little bit of early awards buzz, but ultimately got no love. Some have speculated that audiences didn't quite know how to respond to the film's bittersweet themes, and Mavis is such an unlikable character that it may have turned off others. At the end of the day, Theron's performance is outstanding and that the story is both funny and powerful enough in its examination of prolonged adolescence to warrant a watch.
1593974744|5.0|I purchased this book when it was first published and ended up moving before I got a chance to read it. It stayed in a box in storage for 20 years with other books before I read it. How silly of me - others I knew were reading it a couple of years ago as a \\"great find\\" and so I read it. Loved it. Not only was the story good, but Orson Scott Card is a great writer. I was thoroughly pulled into the story from beginning to end.

B0033H7VI6|3.0|I have never written a review, but felt compelled to do so when I received this knife.  Other reviews noted that the blade was quality but there was some question about the handle.  I can see where that may pose an issue, but overall I am pretty satisfied with the knife itself.  Its sharp, heavy and pretty solid.  The down side is the sheath that it came in.  To call it garbage would be an understatement.  The strap to hold the knife in place is sewn on backwards so you cannot snap it closed.  The fabric is 3 inches to long and has the Velcro on the wrong side as well.  There would be no way to keep the knife locked in place in any position other then hanging from your belt.  And that would not be an issue, but the belt loop is not sewn together.  It just folds over to some more Velcro, and that Velcro is only partially sewn to the sheath.  I would never use this sheath to carry the knife, as it would make it unsafe to do so.  I am very disappointed with my purchase and would not recommend this product to anyone who was not planning on ordering a custom sheath.

0307593312|1.0|Plot is superflous. It simply didn;t come togheter as a unity. The writing is slobby. I got the feeling he never revised his first draft. I skipped paged and paragraphs because it was too boring. The sex scenes were horrible and there were too many of them. Nothing from the charm of his previous books can be found in this one. It seems that the writing is forced, and he wrote whatever crossed his mind, irregardless if it made any sense whatsoever. It seems like the \\"girl with the dragon tatoo\\" crossed with \\"1984\\".<br />What a waste of time.

B00004Z459|4.0|I'm not a big fan of LINKIN PARK, but this HYBRID THEORY is a very good album!!! Besides 1 or 2 songs, all the tracks are great like PAPERCUT, ONE STEP CLOSER, IN THE END, RUNAWAY and PLACE FOR MY HEAD!!!!!
1451683405|5.0|I enjoyed reading this immensely. Very inspiring introduction to the subject and opened up more questions for me (which I quite like). I particularly enjoyed the speculation on how justice systems could be revised to include a more in-depth emphasis on causality. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the subject or any of Dr. Harris's previous work.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I get why this is popular: the sex. But Jesus H, it is poorly written. I had a hard time making it to the \\"steamy\\" scenes because it was just so very badly written. Sentences like \\"His voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel... or something.\\" just made me laugh out loud. There are grammatical errors in here: \\"This is the only sort of relationship I'm interesting in.\\" comes not too long after that first gem of writing. The book is littered with terrible analogies and lazy writing. I haven't bothered to write an Amazon review in a while, but this book is so bad I had to do it.
1416972242|5.0|Clary has never been more confused. The man who threatens all the Shadowhunters is actually her father, Valentine, the boy she couldn't stop thinking about is actually her brother, and there is a whole world her mother kept from her that is full of warlocks, vampires, demons, and werewolves, among other creepy beasties. Having been brought up as a mundane, Clary must find her way in the Shadowhunter world or quickly be devoured by it in City of Ashes: Mortal Instruments, Book Two by Cassandra Clare.<br /><br />Clary doesn't know what to do about Jace now that they recently found out they share a father, and an evil father no less. She has trouble reconciling her feelings for Jace, but she knows her friend Simon, a simple mundane, is the less creepy option. Meanwhile, Jace has been thrown out of the only home he ever knew with the adoptive Lightwood family. Lost and alone, Jace is being punished for the sins of the father he never knew or had allegiance to. But now a war is brewing between Downworlders. A werewolf child and a warlock child were found dead, bled to death, and there is no one more logical to blame than the vampires.<br /><br />The vampires swear they had nothing to do with the deaths, but everyone suspects them. When Jace is investigated by the Clave and held prisoner in the Silent City, his father breaks in. He comes to see Jace and ask for Jace's help, but his own son was not his purpose for visiting the city and killing all the Silent Brothers. He was after the Mortal Sword. With or without Jace's help, Valentine plans to reverse the allegiance of the sword from good to bad so he can control the demons and finally fulfill his purpose- the extermination of the Downworlders who threaten the lives of humans and Shadowhunters alike. Even if the Clave doesn't believe in Jace's innocence, Clary and his adoptive siblings refuse to let him suffer for the evils Valentine has acted on. But will they make it in time to stop the conversion of the Mortal Sword?<br /><br />These books sometimes seem overwhelming because they are quite large, but whenever I read one of Clare's books, I am immediately dragged right into it. I regret to admit I started this series almost 2 years ago and haven't kept up with it since. However, I have been keeping up with the Infernal Devices series, which renewed my interest in this series. Clare does a good job of giving you enough background that you can pick up a book even if you haven't read the one before it in a long while, and for that I was grateful (lately my ever-growing pile of books prevents me from much rereading). And after a few brief pages of catch-up, I was thrown right back into this story with a vengeance. The story was interesting and exciting, and as with all her books, she ends it with a satisfactory conclusion (no real huge cliffhangers) but still keeps you wanting more and leaves the end open for the next installment.<br /><br />The stories are perfect for anyone who likes supernatural or paranormal stories. They are full of mysterious creatures, many of whom balance between their true evil nature and the life the Clave forces them into. There is a god deal of death and violence, but it is mostly of the supernatural type and isn't particularly gory. I love the excitement and in particular, the characters. Jace is that typical bad boy who really has a heart of gold despite his crusty, snarky exterior and you can't help but love him. My one icky-factor is the weirdness between him and Clary, who now appears to be his sister. So we have a Luke and Leia moment, but why is it continuing? And why aren't they grossed out now that they are brother and sister? I can only imagine this will resolve itself eventually and Clare won't have a Flowers in the Attic moment, but who knows where this plans to go... just please make them not be brother and sister because I am all in on team Jace!br /><br />These books sometimes seem overwhelming because they are quite large, but whenever I read one of Clare's books, I am immediately dragged right into it.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This is a very funny book. I laughed out loud at some parts. However if you have not closely followed Tina Fey's career, there are some parts where you don't know what she is talking about. You do feel like you know her as a friend after reading this.  When I saw her on the Academy Awards Show, I felt like I was seeing a personal friend on TV. It is written a little choppily, but is fun to read.
B005F6NA5G|5.0|This is it! It is just what I ordered--the latest album from a remarkable guitarist/vocalist and multi-Grammy winner, George Benson. According to JazzReview's article upon the release of this recording in 2011, George Benson \\"plays his heart out, and the result will most certainly be one of the top 10 discs of not just this year, but probably this coming decade.\\"<br /><br />George Benson has been delighting my ears ever since I heard \\"Breezin'\\" from his Platinum album of the same title which was the first jazz album to achieve Platinum sales in 1976. In a span of five decades and 49 outstanding albums to his credit, he won 10 Grammy awards for his incredible artistry in guitar and vocals. His latest recording,\\"Guitar Man,\\" is one of the best ever albums in the history of jazz guitar. It has been noted that seven out of 12 tracks were recorded in one day. That just shows how adept and dedicated Mr. Benson is in his craft. He is so grateful to his Musical Director, David Garfield, for his \\"incredible support, and to a new star on the upright bass, Ben Williams, and also to his all-time favorite musicians, Joe Sample and Harvey Mason.\\"<br /><br />This album is bound to mesmerize your ears. So sit back, unwind, relax on a comfy settee, sipping not wine but Virgin Margaritas, put your headphones on, turn up the volume, and let George Benson's astounding artistry in guitar and his vocal, scat prowess carry you along on a splendid musical adventure which starts with a lovely solo guitar of \\"Tenderly.\\" Another memorable solo that showcases his terrific fretwork is \\"Danny Boy.\\" Isn't his perfect-sounding signature six-string Ibanez guitar awesome?<br /><br />The repertoire's super highlight is a brilliant rendition of Guy Wood and Robert Mellin's gem of a song, \\"My One And Only Love,\\" which is a testament of his inimitable guitar chops and his arresting vocals. This lyrically, melodically 32-bar-song was written in 1952. Jazz critic, Benny Green, described it as \\"one of the most wrought ballads to be written in the post-war period.\\" In 1953, Frank Sinatra recorded a version that speaks of timeless elegance. Ten years later, John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman came up with a mesmerizing interpretation that became one of the best-loved jazz ballads of all-time. The song's popularity resulted in numerous recordings from quite a number of famous singers and musicians such as Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson, Ann Hampton Callaway, Carly Simon, Sophie Milman, Sting, Rod Stewart, Kenny Rankin, Mark Murphy, Kurt Elling, Oscar Peterson, Wes Montgomery, Stephane Grappelli, Kenny Burrell, Joe Zawinul, MFSB Band, Chris Botti and Paula Cole. I have already created a Playlist of 22 different versions of this song from my music collection, and this one (version #23) from George Benson is one of the very best and a welcome addition to my Playlist. It's so nice to listen to a single song recorded in a variety of styles and interesting interpretations. This is what Mr. Benson says about his take on this song: \\"I'm not Johnny Hartman, but I think there are a lot of Hartman fans who might appreciate an arrangement like that.\\" He co-wrote the beautiful arrangement with David Garfield.<br /><br />An emotional highlight is a heartfelt reading of Buddy Johnson's 1945 standard, \\"Since I Fell For You,\\" featuring George Benson on vocals/guitar and arranger David Garfield on piano. Another enjoyable track with vocals is \\"My Cherie Amour,\\" one of my very favorite songs by Stevie Wonder way back when. Mr. Benson recorded this song to keep his promise to Mr. Wonder. He recalls: \\"I took part in a tribute to Stevie Wonder a few years ago. Stevie came backstage and told me that I should really consider recording that song. I told him I would.\\" And now a promise kept and fulfilled. How wonderful!<br /><br />Other delightful treats for your ears include lively, jazzy \\"Tequila,\\" finger-snappin' \\"Paper Moon\\" and scattin'-a-plenty \\"Fingerlero\\" as well as winning renditions of \\"Don't Know Why\\" and John Lennon/Paul McCartney's \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand.\\"<br /><br />This is the kind of CD that stays interesting from the first track to the final one. It boasts a dozen of songs/tunes to beguile your auditory sense. And most importantly, this is the winner of  \\"Outstanding Jazz Album\\" at the 43rd Annual NAACP Image Awards on February 17, 2012. Congratulations to George Benson and his great team of musicians: Joe Sample (piano), Harvey Mason (drums), Ben Williams (bass), David Garfield (piano, keyboards, arranger), Lenny Castro (percussion), Paul Jackson, Jr. (rhythm guitar), Freddie Washington (bass), Oscar Seaton, Jr. (drums), Charlie Bisharat (violin, viola), Dan Higgins (flute, alto flute, clarinet), Oscar Castro-Neves (arranger) and Chris Walden (keyboards, arranger).<br /><br />George Benson is truly the quintessential GUITAR MAN and this album is indeed a WINNER!<br /><br />With my heartfelt recommendation.nditions of \\"Don't Know Why\\" and John Lennon/Paul McCartney's \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand.\\"<br /><br />This is the kind of CD that stays interesting from the first track to the final one.

B002ONC9NC|4.0|I would absolutely recommend a purchase of this film. It is really moving. I've watched it like twenty times and it never gets old. I never regret buying it.
6305744793|5.0|My mommy got this movie for me and my brother when we were kids and we watched it sooooo much we memorized it in a very short time. I just recently got it for my son i didnt know if he would like it but he really does he asks to watch it everyday. The impersonality of morticia and the comical genius of fester and gomez addams make the movie a treat. From the way that lurch grunts at everything and wedndesday and pugsleys shananigans keep the movie entertaining for all ages up until the end.. excellent movie and fifteen years later im still saying it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Amazon kindle is great app to use on my android device. No problems. Very convenient. Easy to use. And not had prices on books. Definitely recommends this for anyone that enjoys reading
B003VANOFY|2.0|I just purchased another headset after having this headset for about 2 months.  I had driver glitches, I got tired of waiting for the fixes.<br /><br />Issues encountered:  Sound only working on one side, not a confortable headset, full driver not loading, sound coming out fairly flat.<br /><br />Pros:  The wireless worked as advertized.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is very easy to use and works with word files better than any product I've tried.  Two thumbs up!
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game really annoys me, its fun, but the constant asking for a rating annoys me a lot sorry. other than than that its a really fun game
B0016J81B4|5.0|I had a accident that shattered the heel of my foot and it is hard to find a shoe that does not constric it and has a soft thick sole. This shoe is the most comforable shoe I have ever worn. It is designed for the cooking industry to work in the kitchen and has a non slip sole. I paid $300 for custom inserts that were not as comfortable as this shoe. They look like dress shoes and can be worn with a suit even. I highley recomend these shoes for anyone who has any type of foot discomfort. I will buy 2 more pair in case they discontinue making this type. They are a life saver.
6305882592|5.0|One of the best films ever produced. Dark, funny and brilliantly acted.<br />Ruth Gordon was one of the greatest to fill the silver screen!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Me and my husband love to play these games together for hours. It's very entertaining! Would recommend this game to anyone who just needs to pass the time or just likes fun games. :)
B006NXIO7O|3.0|Entertaining, but not realistic enough to ever watch again. Lacks quality acting even though the story line had potential. Next?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game could be better if more games and details were added. I still like this game very much.
B005FNJL7K|5.0|This 2 disc set helps me relive the epic movies.  I read the series many years ago, and felt that the movies did a great job, and now I have a chance to hear all of this any time.  I have been telling everyone about it, and many of my friends have purchased the same set!  Go for it![[ASIN:B005FNJL7K The Lord of the Rings Symphony]]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when first choosing to read the Hunger Games but I was blown away! I read the complete trilogy in a weekend. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend everyone reading the series!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|I'm not good at giving books reviews but I will do my best.<br /><br />This book The Hunger Games was awesome! I loved it from the first page till the very last page. I love the way the author kept me guessing and I even found myself laugh here and there while reading the book.<br />That action in this book was pretty cool. Reading about the main character Katniss first trying to get food for her family, the stepping up to take her sister's place in the games to getting to know the other main character Peeta. Their friendship, being alias, possibly falling in love with each other. The way the two played the games was impressive.<br /><br />So much more can be written about this book but putting them into words not so easy.<br /><br />I would highly reccomend this book to anyone and can't wait to see the movie. Hoped this review helped and didn't give to much away.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|I already had a camera case for my camera but was not very fond of it.  I bought this as it was on sale.  I love it.<br /><br />My camera fits perfectly in it.  Kodak Z915 for reference.<br /><br />Plus it has a little pocket with a zipper closure.  This is perfect for carrying extra batteries.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the buckle loop uses velcro rather than a snap.  Just walking around for a small amount of time and it comes unfastened.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|I have no idea why this film is getting the reviews it is. The only thing I can see is that people are comparing it to 300. Why? I have no idea what so ever, other than the obvious, and if you are going to do that with Immortals then you have to do it with every film.<br /><br />Oh, Beverly Hills Cop was a great movie, but Bad Boys sucked because it was trying to be too much like BHC. You know, because Bad Boys pretty much stole the idea of a comedy with black cops. Dee Dee Dee, duh.<br /><br />So anyways, this movie for me was excellent and the action scenes exceeded 300. Maybe not in quantity, but quality. I also read some people complaining about the Gods's armor and costum, that it looked cheesy. Really? Did you expect them to come down in robes? The Immortals can technically die, sooooo thus the armor. I feel stupid that I even have to explain this.<br /><br />As far as everything else, I loved it. I rarely ever watch a movie twice within 48 hours, but this was the case for Immortals. The last film I watched twice was Black Death from 2010 starring Sean Bean. You should check that out also. Peace and Blessings.<br /><br />~TeaMaster1978 of YouTube~
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. It is seemingly simply, but it requires lots of thought to properly pack the bags. Great game and it passes the time.
161293028X|5.0|This is a definite must-buy classic for all mystery lovers.<br />Complete series of the most memorable adventures.<br />I will defitely recommend this book to OnlineBookClub blog<br /> for a group review/study chapter by chapter on blogger.
B0071NLG0W|3.0|My expectations may have been too high beginning this book.  It took me a bit longer to get into it than it did with the first two and I didn't find the story quite as interesting.  It was still entertaining, but it didn't leave me certain that I'll be getting the next in the series.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Like I said great game with good physics.  Very clever game. I like watching the expressions of the blocks change depending their fate.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|This book is a VERY quick read, but it draws you in qickly and doesn't let go. I really enjoyed it, however it is written in the eyes of a boy who vocabulary is under developed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I selected this book because it was part of the Prime Lending Library and previous reviewers had given it 5 star reviews. For once, the reviews were spot on. This book was a very good read and I finished it a lot sooner than I wanted. The  story had some slow moments, but also a lot of suspense. Would love for the author to continue this series of books and tell more of the story both past and future. Great book overall!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think this is a solid solid solitaire game.  it never crashes and the ads aren't annoying like they are in other games. the game is very stable.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game keeps me entertained ..its challenging and fun..I would definitely recommend this game to anyone :) the challenges get harder each time..I'm still working on one and have been for a while. :)
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Love this album 5 Stars. The Track Someone I Used too Know (also check out Loot & punders RMX) reminds me of Peter Gabriel
B002RI90WM|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable book, very engaging, funny and a little sad .<br />I was sorry to finish it. The way it is written from the dogs perspective makes it all the more interesting and fun . I would highly recommend it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|After watching Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN PARIS, I want to find myself in a situation where I'm having a conversation with REVOLUTIONARY ROAD novelist Richard Yates. With my luck, though, I'd probably be stuck making small talk with late-period Tennessee Williams.<br /><br />But no, I shouldn't be snobbish: after all, the film's main character, Gil (played by Owen Wilson) is quick to denounce a friend of his fiance's as a \\"pseudo-intellectual\\". In other words, the kind of guy like Gil - a hopeless romantic who wishes he lived in Paris, is constantly correcting others on their knowledge of art esoterica, and, worst of all, is a Hollywood screenwriter who really wants to write Novels That Mean Something.<br /><br />Gil is in Paris with his fiance, and despite the obvious postcard potential of the city, Gil's problems go beyond one city. Frankly, it's a problem with the world: well, Gil doesn't think the time he lives in is very inspiring, for him or anyone.<br /><br />So Woody Allen throws him a bone: while Gil is walking the streets of Paris at midnight, he sends him a car to take him to the 1920s. Gil starts to get the picture when he meets a lovely couple at a party: Zelda, and her lover Scott Fitzgerald.<br /><br />This isn't science-fiction. After meeting the Fitzgeralds, Gil runs into Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway (who is given to come-ons like, \\"Have you ever shot a charging lion?\\"), Gertrude Stein, Salvador Dali, and onward. Hemingway gives some writing advice to Gil: \\"If you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer! But not while I'm around!\\" Stein and Pablo Picasso have arguments over whether a painting of his overly sexualizes his subject. The painting's subject is a gorgeous young woman named Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who's been with Picasso, Braque and Modigliani, but finds herself drawn to something different in this American.<br /><br />MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is a movie about the past and the present, but mostly it's a movie about artists: Gil discussing his novel and life with those who would be most qualified to wax about it. And it's a gem of a plot, a lovely fantasy that surprises you at first, and then pulls you in with a dedication to romance.<br /><br />Thankfully the entirety of MIDNIGHT`s focus isn't Famous Names Talking - but it does tend to focus on them a little too much. To something of a detriment, it's a movie about art, rather than one about characters.<br /><br />Nowhere is this more apparent than in the fact that, in the present day, Gil is engaged to a woman (Rachel McAdams) who quite clearly does not share his views on, well, anything. Her mother is typically condescending, and her father is a diehard Tea Party fan who sees a possible Communist in Gil. At one point, thinking that Gil has brought her a gift of jewelry, she responds, \\"I hope it's my taste.\\"<br /><br />As the movie goes on, it becomes clear that the scenes with McAdams and her family are only seen by Woody as pauses between the 1920s scenes. They're not very funny. There's a pseudo-slapstick scene involving a missing pair of earrings that's painful in its false caricature. It's more than a shame that McAdams isn't given much to do besides be angry and shallow.<br /><br />Especially because, in a way, you can understand a frustration that her fiance, already spending too much time writing instead of being with her, is now babbling about sharing a night with Pablo Picasso. Who wouldn't dislike a guy like that?<br /><br />It's a testament to Woody Allen's skill that a strange thing happens as the movie continues: you stop being annoyed at Gil's precious self-consciousness (and at Owen Wilson's over-earnest performance), and you start being as charmed as Allen obviously is by his love of beauty. All those artists whose job it is to observe the world and explain it in a beautiful way; all the picture perfectness of Paris landmarks in the \\"Golden Age\\"; it's intoxicating. And Gil learns the lesson he needs to learn at the end, and it'shandled in a lovely, realistic way that makes perfect sense once you get to it.<br /><br />It's a very good film. Because it's not as concerned with characters as it should be, it sometimes drags while we wait for Gil to move on to the next Famous Face. But Owen Wilson's obvious excitement is contagious, and Marion Cotillard is as charming as expected and more, and things move just as they should to a proper, tender conclusion. And also, you have Paris in the day and the night - which, even in Gil's uninspiring Present, can't hurt.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Probably the best camera bag I have.  The price is awesome. The quality is great.  The Design works.  If I were to add one thing...It would be nice to have a water resistent cover you could pop out if the weather goes south.

B0042RUMIW|5.0|I first saw this show on cable TV and fell in love with the concept of a performer of Sting's magnitude working with a symphony orchestra.  The CD/DVD did not disappoint.  It was excellent value for money and I can play the CD in the car and office, watch the DVD at home or take it to friends' homes and they all agree it is just the best show.  The camera work is exceptional, as well as the sound.  It is riveting to watch the soloists playing their instruments and one understands the absolute dedication that performers of this ilk must have to create such a beautiful and enjoyable experience.  I can't imagine anyone leaving that concert hall not feeling totally fulfilled.  Thank you Amazon for shipping my treasure to me xx
B005DR64OQ|1.0|I am on a roll. Yesterday I reviewed the worst spy thriller, today I found the bottom of the lowest of home invasion thrillers.<br />I have usually been friendly towards Nicole Kidman, but I am challenged about my attitude now. She gives us a terrible performance as hysterical hostage here. We don't expect better from Nicolas Cage any more, but I still had illusions about Nicole. Well, too bad.<br />Let's not lose too many words about this trashy flick. No script, no plot, no suspense, no actors, no nada. Nuff said.
B005F6NA56|4.0|My first exposure to Leslie Feist was her previous collection of songs, The Reminder.  For me, that set the bar pretty high for anything to follow. I, initially, did not care for Metals as much as The Reminder, however, after playing it more and more I have come to really appreciate what she has put out there with Metals and it is now one of my most played cd's. It may not be as fun and quirky as some of her previous efforts, but she is such a wonderfully, talented singer/songwriter that she will reel you in. How anyone can resist her haunting, sublime vocals is beyond me. I am looking forward to what she surprises us with in the future.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a fantastic story. Thru out the book it makes you question if you could  change the past, what would you change? What are the ramifications of those changes? Can you excuse immorality and unethical behavior because you want to right a past wrong? This book makes for great dialog. Can't wait to discuss with my book club. Be forewarned, this is a long book.
0375869026|5.0|Before I begin my review, I must add this caveat- I cannot stand it when the pictures do not match the characters in the book. Enough said.<br /><br />This book's roots are sunk deeply in reality. August is ugly. Not just a bit homely, but the kind of bizarre that makes young children cry and run when they first see him. And, he's 10. Reality has become very real to him and no longer can watchful parents prepare him for life beyond home-schooling. He knows others will find his appearance freakish but that does not stop him from facing life, vicious life, with the clarity of an old soul.<br /><br />Many excellent reviews have been written regarding this book. Believe them. It has won more than one award in the month since it was published. They were earned. R.J. Palacio has created a library \\"must have\\" that will change lives. My hope for readers is that THEY share it with someone THEY love once their reading is complete.

But no such luck in getting a repair - let alone a prompt repair.  After a couple of hours trying to find service for this piece, including calling the factory service center I finally unburied online, (it was in Pittsburgh - I'm in Philadelphia) - I was told they might be able to get me the part but it would be a while. I finally sent it back to Amazon.
B0055SWM08|3.0|this game is okay. I like the relaxing music and it works just fine on my kindle. It's a little bit too simple and boring for me. I'm a Hardcore puzzle game player and this one just isn't challenging enough in my opinion. I will probably keep playing it only because I paid a buck for it, but I'll play it when I'm REALLY bored or when I'm not in the mood to challenge my brain.
B0016MJ6T2|1.0|Seth Green and Macaulay Culkin team up to explore the morally and sexually confused NYC night club scene of the early '90s. Shot with a transparent low budget, it's an excruciatingly amateur production: bad lighting, listless performances, crude cinematography and creatively bankrupt screenwriting are just the tips of the iceberg. Neither Green nor Culkin seems particularly involved in their role, with each actor's strange cadence and emotionless delivery giving the constant impression that a cash-strapped director used first takes for every shot. Without a single likeable character to its name, Party Monster chooses to embrace and celebrate a lifestyle so waspy, entitled and superficial that I caught myself actively rooting against the lot of them. Overdrugged, shallow, trivial and irritating, its only use is as a showcase of fantastically absurd costumes and makeup.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|OK, so this is erotic literature. No questions about it. The writing is simplistic (borderline poor), the characters are underdeveloped, and an overwhelming majority of the book is gratuitous descriptions of sex. There you have it! It's porn translated into literature. E.L. James can sure whip out some saucy and hot sex scenes, but the rest of the book is just the fluff. That being said, if you're looking to read this novel purely to be sexually engaged (and not in any other way), then this will definitely do the job!
B004HWT6DO|5.0|David Fincher's take on the men behind a social networking juggernaut is an ensnaring riff on adolescent genius, intellectual property, misplaced loyalty and the blurred line between inspiration and plagiarism. Jesse Eisenberg is magnetic as the quick-lipped, scorned, socially acidic orchestrator Mark Zuckerberg; armed with both a fiery stockade of dialog and a vibrant crew of supporting actors to fire it at, he never wants for the right words, nor the perfect target, for an occasion. Eisenberg is especially effective in the dry, serious legal hearings he's subjected to throughout the plot, where he's most at liberty to cut to the quick with a pointed jape or toy with the formulaic arguments of a prosecutor. Sufficiently technical without flooding the plot with IT-speak, it's as sharp and engaging as Good Will Hunting, if not as touchy-feely and redeeming. When it was all said and done, I was left with the same impression of Zuckerberg as I was of Steve Jobs after finishing his biography: the guy's a scumbag, but he found his sweet spot in this world and made the most of it, for both himself and society at large.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I don't know where to start. If you haven't seen Planet Earth, you need to see it! It is one of those nature series that you must see at least once. Comparable to other notable series like Blue Planet, or Life. The Blu-ray makes it even more of a visual wonder and experience. I highly recommend you pick this up, especially since it is also very cheap for 6-discs.
1250006341|5.0|Season two of Downton Abbey has concluded and we are left in limbo until it returns next Fall in the UK and January 2013 in the US.<br /><br />*deep sigh*<br /><br />For those like myself who, have watched and re-watched every blessed minute, yet, just can't get enough of the award winning ITV/PBS television mini-series Downton Abbey and are in total Downton withdrawal, may I suggests this stunning full-color coffee table-sized book about the series, THE WORLD OF DOWNTON ABBEY?<br /><br />The publisher touts it as a \\"lavish look at the real world--both the secret history and the behind-the-scenes drama--of the spellbinding Emmy Award-winning Masterpiece TV series Downton Abbey.\\" This is no idle boast. From cover to cover this 303 page oversized-volume is packed with sumptuous full-color pictures of the production, the cast, historical connections and its shining star, Highclere Castle, the grand manor house in Hampshire where the series is filmed.<br /><br />The author Jessica Fellowes is the niece of the series creator and writer Julian Fellowes. Not only does she have the inside scoop into the production of the series, she is also well qualified to write the text as a journalist and the former Deputy Editor of Country Life magazine. Equally important is the photographer Nick Briggs, who captures intimate and awe inspiring images of the production that send us back into memorable scenes or highlight costuming and scenery.<br /><br />Organized into nine chapters: Family Life; Society; Change; Life in Service; Style; House & Estate; Romance; War; and Behind the Scenes, each chapter is written in context to the series characters and their roles and included pertinent quotes from the screenplay illustrating key scenes and events in the series\\"<br /><br />`I mean, one way or another, everyone goes down the aisle with half the story hidden.' Violet, The Dowager Countess<br /><br />There are also quotes from the actors and actresses about their characters:<br /><br />`There's an independence about Mary - she's not influenced by anyone and she's very much her own person, she makes her own decisions. I understand her because I'm one of three girls too and I've always been defiant that I didn't want to do what they did.' Michelle Dockery<br /><br />...and from the creator:<br /><br />`There's an element of performance. They were all performing a role that had been decreed for them. For and aristocrat to be convincing, he must look like an aristocrat.' Julian Fellowes<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the insights from the costume designer Susannah Buxton on her research influences for the clothing and the historical vignettes that linked the series to actual period personalities such as Daisy, Countess of Warwick, and Mary Leiter, an American buccaneer that inspired Julian Fellowes to create the character of Cora Levinson who married Robert, the future Earl of Grantham in 1889.<br /><br />Overall, the most spectacular impression from this volume is its sheer bulk and beauty. Any Downtonite, Edwardian historian, or period drama lover could get lost in this volume for days. Creator Julian Fellowes rightfully opens the book with a brief forward, offering us insights and asides, yet, I felt quite cheated that Violet, The Dowager Countess of Grantham was not given the last word.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenprosere's an independence about Mary - she's not influenced by anyone and she's very much her own person, she makes her own decisions.

B006SVHOL8|5.0|I wanted to see this movie but was a bit hesitant after reading the reviews, but decided to give it a try. It ended up being a very good movie, esp. during the times we currently live in where something like this subject matter could really happen....then what?
0062515675|1.0|I'm not going to waste too much time on this. But I want to save anyone the potential time waste of reading this book.<br /><br />I was hoping for something new, something inspiring...I got rehashed self help cliches. I will admit I couldnt bring myself to finish it so if there is something spectacular at the end...I apologize. I highly doubt it though.<br /><br />Generally the whole thing just felt contrived. An overworked lawyer goes on a spiritual retreat in India after a heart attack? The \\"fable\\" or storyline if you will... is so weak it barely would carry a cheap disney movie. I felt like I was being talked down to by someone younger than me.<br /><br />Its pretty rare I fail to finish a book, but this one was really worth putting down. The most maddening thing about books like this is, in its superficial pandering it makes difficult life problems seems simple.<br /><br />I have no idea how this book was A - published B - became popular or C - has more positive reviews on here than negative. Sure there are undeniable truths in this book.... but they are all sugarcoated and tossed together like a grab bag of bumper sticker slogans to the point where the sum total equals useless.<br /><br />Worst of all it wastes the time and money of people like me who are sincerely trying to improve their life experience.
B006OFN0SE|3.0|Everything that Eastwood directs is, in my book, a must-see.  I was especially interested in this film, about a quirky public figure who did much good and much damage.  I read a bio of JEH that traced his rise as a pioneering law enforcer of genius to his decline as an old-fashioned hack who had outlived not just his usefulness but his time.  It is absolutely true what they say about him, that he should have retired a hero in 1940, but instead he held onto power and abused it and the nation.  He was corrupted by the power that he held for far too long and became a political player whose methods can only be described as manipulative and even evil.<br /><br />That story is complex and difficult to tell because of the subtleties that must be addressed.  JEH was from a time so removed from ours it is hard to imagine, when anarchists and bolsheviks were a great \\"threat\\", homosexuality was not discussed, and the existence of organized crime was denied.  JEH has an impossibly strange accent and 19C mores, an anachronism waiting to happen.  To be honest, Di Caprio only partially carries this off in spite of being a first-rate talent - his accent is not believable and he ages unrealistically.<br /><br />I enjoyed this, but will not buy it as I won't want to watch it again.  It is a relatively weak film experience.  While not spectacular or of typical hollywood hyperbole, I did not get much of a sense of history or public purpose.  Eastwood refuses to sensationalize or speculate on JEH's sexuality and rightly so.  But there is something too labored about his portrait.
145162445X|1.0|Dark is not Dark... It is Light!  Black is not Black... It is White!  Up is not Up... It is Down! I could do this all day and it still wouldn't make any of the above nonsensical statements true!  Even if I add \\"and its unstable!\\" to the end of them.<br /><br />This book is a complete non-starter on the question implied in it's title \\"Why there is something rather than nothing\\".  However the author doesn't let that deter him from redefining the word \\"nothing\\" to mean actually \\"something\\" and that \\"something\\" actually has properties such as \\"unstable\\", \\"energy\\", \\"dense\\", and \\"hot\\" i.e., by definition NOT \\"nothing\\".<br /><br />However, I love that fact that he did this! It is going to make casual conversation so much more interesting now.  For example: \\"What did she say?\\", \\"Nothing.\\",  \\"Really?\\", \\"Yes!, and it was the most energetic, unstable, and heated nothing she has never said so far!\\"  Absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />Had the author left the big questions of Ultimate Origins to the Philosophers and instead just presented the evidence for his theory of how the Big Bang occurred this may have been hailed as a seminal work in the field of Theoretical Physics.  But due to the nonsensical nature of his primary premise of \\"nothing is something\\" he has cast aspersions upon the entire theory and his motives for positing.<br /><br />Absurd.

B005MYEQ4U|3.0|There is a very good side to this movie and a very bad side.<br /><br />Woody Allen has made some very good movies and some really awful movies; this one combines both sides.<br /><br />The good side is that part of the movie's plot is charmingly original: a wannabe writer (Gil) in Paris has a surrealistic experience (which is ironic) and at midnight he goes back to the Paris of the 1920s, transported in a gorgeous car to die for. He meets a who's who of the intellectual elite of the time: Cole Porter, Jean Cocteau, Luis Bunuel, Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot and Salvador Dali (what? no Ezra Pound?). Here, Allen has done his homework and the actors portray those personages perfectly; for example, Hemingway's speech is an aggressive staccato while Dali speaks as if he was on drugs. The enthusiasm that Gil experiences is infectious. The costumes are great as are the settings. As for Paris, it is a beautiful city, especially if one ignores the Parisians, whom even the French despise (and that says something right there!).<br /><br />Now for the bad side.<br />Woody Allen is a pseudointellectual who likes to put down other pseudointellectuals and we see it in Gil's rivalry with Paul, as well as in other films. And only a pseudointellectual would think that living in Paris, and only in Paris, will automatically make one a good writer. Hundreds of superb writers, from Pushkin to Narayan to Unamono to Poe never lived in Paris. Mind you, Paris is a beautiful city, but so is Florence, London, Munich, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Kyoto, etc. etc. As for the French being so much superior to Americans in everything . . . give me a break.<br /><br />As for the characters, they are caricatures, just cliches. Inez, Gil's fiancee, is a relentlessly ball busting bitch with whom Gil admits he has nothing in common, at which point we have to ask: just exactly why is he marrying her? On top of that she admits an infatuation with Paul andadmits to cheating on Gil by sleeping with Paul. O . . . K . . . As for Gil, he is such a wimp! Even when he learns of this, he does nothing in retaliation to either Inez or Paul. I suppose that that is called being a superior intellect. His future in-laws are even worse cliches; the father is a crass businessman (gee, what a surprise) who cannot appreciate France's superiority on all things, and the mother is only interested in buying expensive stuff.<br /><br />The character of Gil is interesting only because he is a younger, blonde version of Woody Allen: the verbosity, the catty comments, the wimpiness, even some of the gestures. In a way this is a relief because if there is one thing that we do not need to see again is Allen, who nowadays looks like death warmed over, attempting to be a ladies' man.<br /><br />Throughout, Gil is in conflict with his fiancee; he wants to stay in Paris and thereby automatically becoming a great writer while she wants him to return to California to lead a crass commercial life. In the end, he decides to stay in Paris, whereupon he instantly meets his soulmate (gee, what a surprise).<br /><br />See the movie, but definitely don't buy it.
B000005J56|5.0|Buena Vista Social Club arrived in time for Valentine's Day and is a huge favorite already. The music is so uplifting and spirited we break out into a dance when it plays.  Perfect, barely used, condition and appreciated the price.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I am so impressed with this book. It is clear that it is written in Jaycee's own words, and not those of a ghost writer. It feels like a conversation, not a book. It explains in detail what happened during those 18 years, and how truly devastating it was to her emotional development. Yet, in these pages, her creativity and loving spirit shine through, and I can only begin to imagine the wonderful things she will do for others with her foundation.

0307949508|1.0|I really enjoyed the first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Although I noticed some typos and mistakes, perhaps due to the translation or Nook version, I quite enjoyed the story about the two main characters and looked forward to reading the sequel.<br /><br />What happened? There is barely a connection between this book and the first.  Instead of following the original, interesting and flawed characters that we cared about from the first book, we're instead given lengthy diatribes about shopping at Ikea, eating fast food and an irrational love for coffee.  If those parts were edited out, the book would be probably 100 pages, not 400.  The flawed characters were replaced with unbelievable characters with superhuman strengths that we aren't given a chance to like, never mind care about. There were lots of typos this time around, too. Good times.  I can only guess that a friend wrote this horrid sequel, albeit with good intentions.<br /><br />Take the $9.99 you saved from not buying this book and experience the story firsthand:<br />Go to Ikea, buy a piece of furniture. Be sure to keep the note of the model and make because apparently it matters.<br />Eat fast food and support factory farming.<br />Drink lots and lots and lots and lots of coffee, preferably at night. NEVER DRINK OR ADMIT TO DRINKING PLAIN WATER. If you cannot drink coffee, you must drink a Coca-Cola, preferably regular, but diet will do, as long as you can tell someone or advertise the brand.<br />Smoke cigarettes. They're not good for you, but neither is violence. It's all relative.<br />Make and eat sandwiches. They're magic and will give you superhuman strength.<br />If you're attractive, everyone will want to sleep with you, even if they're under age or married.  Don't disappoint them!

0439023521|5.0|If you've just crawled out from under a rock, haven't seen movie trailer for the past 8 months, and decided randomly to read this review on Hunger Games (the next big young-adult novel series) let me fill you in on what is going on.<br /><br />Katniss (yeah about the only floor in this novel is the prog's name. Katniss? Seriously? reminded me of [[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)]] and the study that revealed the more 'street' a name was the worse the outcomes were for the child.)<br /><br />SORRY the plot: Katniss is selected to be part of this novel's dystopian 'Hunger Games' a last person standing game held for the 1% entertainment.<br /><br />For what is in many ways a straightforward plot, Collins certainly packs in enough twists to not only keep you guessing, but some surprising humour and wit often not seen in modern writing.<br /><br />I must confess when first hearing about the Hunger Games I dismissed the books and movie as more Twilightish sappy drivel... Not only does Hunger Games side-step the mush, but actually has an interesting 'love' story that doesn't have any male reader not trying to impress his Edward loving girlfriend reaching for the barf-bucket.<br /><br />Overall pretty damn awesome reading.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I'm a big fan of this headset.  I've not had any major issues with them, they just work and work well.  I would say that it has improved my gaming experience quite a bit.  I'm sure a full surround sound setup might improve it as well but, the headset doesn't bother other people in my home.  And I don't have game sound feedback over the mic which bothers me, as it changes what I'm hearing as I want to hear sounds from my position not elsewhere on the map.<br /><br />The only thing I think they are missing is rechargeable batteries and perhaps a charging station for when they are not in use.  I currently use rechargeable AAA Sanyo Eneloop batteries and it works, however built in or hot swappable batteries would be a good extra.  Also perhaps using AA batteries for a longer lifespan would be nice.  Using a 2000mAh AA instead of 800mAh AAA would be nice.<br /><br />  PROS:<br />  Good sound.<br />  Allows full immersion gaming while others are sleeping.<br />  Fairly comfortable.<br /><br />  CONS:<br />  Occasional radio interference noise (Might consider a different less used frequency for these),<br />  Not WIFI spectrum.<br /><br />  Make them better:<br />  Rechargeable  or AA batteries Or even a way to take the XBOX controller battery
B005JSM5YW|5.0|Crazy, Stupid Love is truly one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time!  It is Steve Carell at his very best; his comedic timing is impecable.  You get to see a new side of Ryan Gosling as well, as the cock-sure and charming lady's man, Jacob Palmer.  He befriends Cal Weaver (Steve) and becomes a mentor, of sorts, to his newly separated friend, and shows him how to manuever through the single man's world.  Emmy Stone comes into the movie (in her best comedic performance to date), as a woman who sets Jacob's world on it's ear.  They had such great chemistry; it really comes across on screen and makes the movie that much more enjoyable.  Not a mushy, chick flick, but a clean, super funny, heart warming romantic-comedy that you'll definitely want to own so that you can watch it again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun to waste time and my little siblings stay very entertained. it's great for car trips or keeping them busy in restraunts.
B003UESJ9W|4.0|I don't think you even have to like country music to enjoy this movie, you just have to like music!  I have to admit, this is not my favorite movie of all time, but I definitely enjoyed it enough to buy it.  Gwyneth Paltrow has a beautiful voice, and she's a superb actress, though she was awkward in some of her onstage performances.  Leighton Meester, who I have seen in Gossip Girl, also has a nice voice, and she was convincing in her portrayal of a naive, country \\"barbie doll\\" who falls in love with a fellow singer/songwriter played by Garrett Hedlund.  Garrett has already started to pave the way as the man to watch in young Hollywood, having acted films like Death Sentence, Friday Night Lights, Four Brothers, and Tron, which came out around the same time as Country Strong.  Garrett Hedlund was amazing in this film!  Tim McGraw lent his cabin to Garrett, who was not a professionally-trained singer, to learn to play the guitar.  He had six months of lessons, and what you see on the screen is simply, for lack of a better word, amazing.  He has a low, country strong voice, that has become my favorite on the CD.  In a movie, where the only thing lacking was a better script, these stars definitely shined.  Of course, last but not least, Tim McGraw, who played the husband to Gwyneth's character, was dynamic; he's just a natural on screen.  He and Garrett first met on the set of Friday Night Lights, where Tim played Garrett's controlling, mean-spirited father.  Knowing Tim's work though, I spent the whole movie wishing he would sing!  His voice was definitely missed, but on the CD, he and Gwyneth share a duet.  All in all, is was a tragic portrayal of a life spinning out of control in the harsh light of fame.  &lt;The movie has 2 Soundtrack CDs.  Both are worth the money!>
1594744769|3.0|Such a fantastic premise, and some truly fascinating found photos to establish believability, and yet for me the book as a whole elicits a mere \\"meh\\". As a mixed media artist who frequently incorporates vintage photos into my pieces, and as a consummate lover of fairy tales and fantasy both dark and light, I really wanted to be enthralled and end up loving this book, but I found it throughout to fall just short of engaging. The writing didn't blow me away, though it wasn't awful. The characters failed to captivate, though they were certainly unusual. I found the story vaguely cumbersome, somewhat boring and plodding...and honestly, I wished for a startling, if not beautiful, conclusion. Instead I finished it with a degree of indifference, hence my disappointed \\"meh\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins does it again I loved this book. This trilogy is amazing. I love the fact that the story picks up right where it left off from book 1. I also love the fact that the main character is a strong but reluctant girl. I think that girls will pick up this book just as much a boy will. There is just something about Katniss that I think all children can relate to.<br /><br />Collins has done a great job in getting us inside the head of Katniss. She comes alive in the story. By the time I put the book down I feel like she is great friend. The details that Collins puts into the story is so alive that you can see it in your mind's eye.<br /><br />My students and my own boys have continued to encourage me to read the third installment, which I am planning on. The discussions that happen have been great.<br /><br />If you haven't got into this trilogy yet, I would recommend it. It's definitely a page turner.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I normally don't read non-fiction and wont read much more after this terrible story.<br />The plot was inconsistent and had many flaws in it. Next time God needs a good editor.
0545091020|2.0|I've been spending Spring Break reading (on audiobook) these \\"Hunger Games\\" books which the newspapers say have been such big best sellers and which have a much hyped movie opening this month.<br /><br />They are, I have found, thoroughly repellant pieces - considerably less well written than the Harry Potter series. Wallowing in poverty and violence and simply nasty (the sole \\"redeeming\\" central feature is the central teenage girl - well read by \\"Law & Order's\\" Dr. Elizabeth Olivet, Carolyn McCormick for Scholastic Audiobooks - being more or less in love with two boys, both in love with her and noble in their mutual jealousy and insecurity) I'm sure the author and her publishers felt they were perfect for teenage girls who need a follow-up to their \\"Twilight\\" vampire/werewolf series with the same central premise. For ADULTS, imagine a series with the general tone of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale without the sex. I can't imagine what the appeal is unless the children in the target audience are fascinated by the shallow romance and a world like that a Rick Santorum or other generic, paranoiac right wing politician might fashion with just a *touch* of the logical excitement of the competitions in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (second best of the Rollings books, second *worst* of the Warner Brothers movies) only with all the contestants actually trying to kill each other. I have read actual pornography which made me feel less morally \\"dirty\\" than any of these three essentially sexless books did.<br /><br />While I do *not* recommend them, the movie may be successful as a violent action sci-fi genre piece. If it has a problem it will be that the books are aimed at teenage girls and this kind of film is generally not.<br /><br />I can't wait to \\"cleanse the palate\\" with Naomi Novik's latest \\"Temoraire\\" book (The Crucifer of Gold, the seventh book in the series a student of mine got me hooked on) which aren't *that* much better than these books from hunger -they're basically the Napoleonic Wars with Dragons and stretched to interesting locales around the world - but they are better written and not as overtly anti-social even though the ultimate trajectory of the story is, like The Hunger Games and the still earlier and decidedly superior Narnia Chronicles, ever downward into even greater disasters (how many people remember - spoiler alert! - that in the final Narnia book C.S. Lewis destroys that entire *world*?!? I think *he* thought it was an Apocalyptic \\"happy ending\\"!). Unfortunately the Novik audiobook (Crucifer of Gold) isn't out until April and unlike the Potters, I don't care enough about it to sit down with a hard copy. For now it's the nastiness of Katniss Everdeen and her Panem world and Suzanne Collins' variations on her Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mocking Jay) that I'm stuck with mulling over; not happy or satisfying thoughts at all.<br /><br />I felt I had to read them because a healthy percentage of my students might - but absent similar compulsion, I cannot recommend that anyone else feel driven to unless your idea of light \\"beach reading\\" for pleasure is those chapters of William L. Shirer's Rise and Fall of The Third Reich dealing with Nazi Germany's concentration camps. This trilogy is ultimately \\"entertainment\\" on that general level - but not nearly as well written.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I was in the software industry back in the 80s and was very aware of the Apple/Microsoft battle.  I'd read various articles about Steve Jobs, but until now had no idea what an as***** he was (his term) or how truly brilliant he was.  This book was really a terrific read and, by the end, I was sad that such a creative force was gone from the world.  I don't own an iPod or an iPhone or an iPad, but now I think I'll at least look into an iPhone when my contract is up just to see if it's as great as Jobs proclaimed them to be!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|\\"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.\\" Frankly, I'd rather play the game of Jenga; the repercussions are less dire. When you hear the term \\"transcendent television\\" being bandied about, you must break out that grain of salt. Except that GAME OF THRONES does fit the phrase. It deserves all the plaudits. I've finally caught up with this show, and I am astounded with how good it is. Big ups to HBO for going all in with fantasy writer George R.R. Martin's sweeping saga of warring dynasties and dark magic beyond the border. It's a hell of an undertaking. I'll be emptying out my bin of adjectives.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has a knack for making his readers care for his characters, and this seamlessly translates onto the screen, by virtue of exceptional writing, superb production values, and a scintillating cast. The thought and labor that went into the exquisite show opening alone informs you that the showrunners are not effing about.<br /><br />The canvas spans geographies and numbers a sprawling cast. In a world in which summers span decades and murderous winters can last a lifetime, powerful noble families play the game of thrones. In the chilly north, the undermanned Night's Watch diligently patrols the ancient Wall, safeguarding the realm from demonic elements that stalk the darkness beyond. Except that there's been nary a sighting of these fell creatures in many decades. The Night's Watch, long since fallen on hard times, nowadays tends to be composed of felons, knaves, and vagabonds.<br /><br />While much of the story takes place in the Seven Kingdoms and focuses on the power struggle between the honorable Starks and the conniving Lannisters, things are developing in the East, in the grassy plains of Essos. There, the son of a deposed king hungers for what once was his inheritance, to the extent that he sells his petrified sister to the warlord of the fierce Dothraki, a clan of nomadic horsemen, in hopes of marshalling an army. From the first episode, ominous clouds of war hover over the Seven Kingdoms.<br /><br />I can't recall a recent show that's gripped me so from jump. Showrunners/head writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss invest these ten episodes with humanity and amazing clarity. This is a remarkable feat, given the complex characters and dense mythology and the many interweaving plot threads and the huge chunks of exposition. This being a faithful adaptation of Martin's novel, you can't sit easy. Favorite characters may or may not break your heart, may or may not make it to Season Two.<br /><br />Credit the writers but also credit the actors for bringing their roles to vivid, full-blooded life. I dunno, maybe it's the British accents. Love them, hate them, but each part is nuanced, each character not altogether noble, not altogether depraved. Excepting the vile Prince Joffrey; I really hate that kid, all praise to young Jack Gleeson for eliciting such emotion. I didn't think I could sympathize with Lena Headey's scheming Cersei Lannister but there are moments in which she demonstrates an aching vulnerability (which she then promptly masks). Sean Bean - or \\"poster boy,\\" to quote one of the showrunners - lends marvelous gravitas to his lead role of Eddard Stark. But, to me, the ones who really stand out are the misfits and outcasts. I love, really love, the clever dwarf prince Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) and Eddard Stark's feisty tomboy daughter Arya Stark (star-in-the-making Maisie Wiliams) and Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow (Kit Harington). Dinklage so well-deserved his Emmy and Golden Globe awards.<br /><br />Lastly, we are so lucky that GAME OF THRONES ended up on cable. It it had landed on one of them regular networks, it's probably canceled by now. As it is, Season Two can't have come soon enough. To echo one and all, GAME OF THRONES is a rousing triumph of style AND substance and a dazzling psychological drama. It is magnificently realized and stunningly visualized. And those direwolves are just too damn cute.<br /><br />This impressive DVD set is boss! It collects all ten episodes of Season One and comes with five discs.

B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is very long so haven't finished it yet.  It is a very engrossing history about cancer as a disease and the various ways it has been treated since ancient times.  The book is so well written that it just keeps your interest as a fiction novel does.  I am an ex-medical laboratory technologist so I may be biased but it is an entirely readable account about cancer.  I am so glad that I got the Kindle edition as the sheer weight of a hard bound book would probably discourage me from taking it with me to read on weekends away.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Tintin is a young European journalist who also solves crimes. After buying a model ship, he becomes involved in a mystery about a pirate treasure and finds his life is in danger.<br /><br />I loved this movie. The motion capture technique is fascinating and so well-done. Some characters look cartoonish while others look very real; the scenery is strikingly beautiful. The action-packed story is part pirate swashbuckler and part Indiana Jones adventure; the combination makes for a spectacular and exciting film with a sweet, smart, and very likable young man at its center.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially for adults, and you don't have to be familiar with the graphic novel source material to enjoy it.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I saw a stage production here in Seattle about ten years ago and it amazed me.  For the past fortnight I've been watching the 25th Anniversary telecast on PBS, and this led to my becoming truly obsessed with this musical.  Thus I have order two copies of the movie here at Amazon, plus the two-disc soundtrack, and I am leaning on ordering the Original London Cast cd.<br /><br />I was instantly captivated by this film, and I think it is an excellent cinematic interpretation of the stage play.  All of the acting is superb, especially Gerard Butler and Minnie Driver.  Butler's singing leaves a bit to be desired, but I was not aware of that as I watched the film, being so utterly captivated by his film persona, his beauty and his powerful performance.  His beauty is, of course, questionable in this role;  yet he makes the Phantom a monster in action if not entirely in appearance.<br /><br />The finest aspect of the film is that we hear the score with a film orchestra, and thus, for me, the music is enhanced in beauty and magnificence.  The changes from the stage production work extremely well.  A cinematic version should not be a duplicate of a stage production -- they are entirely different mediums.<br /><br />The film is powerful and imaginative, an excellent rendition of a romantic classic.  The music, written by a man in love for the woman of his dreams, captures the essence of romance.  I love this film and will be watching it again tonight.  And perhaps tomorrow night as well.  The only \\"defect\\" is that the disc won't play on my laptop DVD player, and I would love to experience the entire film really loud on headphones,in deep darkness with just the images of the film before me.
B004M9AS3Y|1.0|When I first took this out of the box I loved it.  It's obviously very well made & I've had other Lowepro bags before so right away I knew it was a quality product.  My problem is it's small...FAR too small for what I bought it for.  The picture has this bag with a DSLR with a fair sized lens & a 15\\" laptop.  As soon as I got it out of the box I put my Nikon D7000 with it's 18-105mm lens (which is not a huge lens) in the camera pouch & my iPad in the the \\"laptop\\" slot.  The bag was completely filled up & all out of shape (the way the camera is on one side throws the whole thing out of proportion).  The 2 slots in the pictures that look as though they'd be for accessories I could barely stuff my iPad charger & iPhone chargers into.  The bag is so tight & stuffed I could barely even get the pens in the pen slots.<br /><br />It's a well made & good looking bag & if all I had was an iPad & some accessories it would be fine, but it's far far too small (in my opinion) for a camera & iPad, let alone a laptop.  I can't imagine what the previous reviewers were thinking to rate this so highly.  It was a complete & utter waste of money & as far as I'm concerned it was falsely advertised.

B0074JODP8|5.0|I just watched my 2nd show with Joe Bonamassa on KQED, and have totally fallen in love with his music.  I did purchase at the $125.00 level, so I could get all the music from that night of \\"Live at The Royal Albert Hall!\\"  I have been to the RAH in London on 3 different ocassions to see my favorite band, The Moody Blues, so the RAH has very good memories for me.  I've also been very busy on amazon.com buying more of his music.  I also purchased a ticket for his show in Fresno, CA, that is coming up on 19 Apr 2012, and can't wait to see him live.  I had never heard of this guy, but when he invited Eric Clapton to come out and play a song with him, I would have to say that Joe Bonamassa \\"Has Arrived.\\"  He is fantistic and awesome, and very methodical at times, which puts him in his own style of music.  Thank God for KQED introducing this young man to us, as he is definitly has come into his own!!!  Like Stevie Ray Vaughn says, \\"If the house is rockin', come on in.\\"<br /><br />Peace Out ~ BluesSongBird

B006YTYIXG|5.0|Ever since the debut release in 1998, i have been amazed by the relentless energy and brutality of Soulfly. I feel the diversity of the albums and themes have really made the band as a whole an unstoppable powerhouse in heavy metal! This new album does not dissapoint, and in my opinion the production value and time put into Enslaved has surpassed some of their previous albums. I will be a loyal and dedicated fan of the soulfly tribe untill the day that i die! This will easily become one of the top metal albums of 2012 and the Soulfy legacy will continue to remain insane!!!
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I can't pinpoint exactly what the trouble was (or maybe there was no trouble at all, after all is just my opinion), but thios new WRCKING BALL is so much superior to MAGIC and WORKING ON A DREAM that I was really surprised. The album is a blast, every song very well produced. Maybe trouble was production, mixing, whatever, but apparently this new direction (changing producers and almost no E-Strret Band) worked. Usually, I did not care that much for Bruce's albuns without the E-Street Band, but in this case I surrender: this album is simply too good.<br /><br />The words to Clarence Clemons at the end are tear inducing.

0439023521|1.0|This is better than the twilight junk.  But Katniss Everdeen is nearly as poorly demonstrated as what's her name - Bella.  There really isn't a character in this whole story that is drawn out. It's all about the absurd plot,  the whole nonsense about whether Peeta likes Katniss for real is absurd.  And this is a book that is all plot - and really it isn't a good plot, it's just that she can craft it so you want to know what is going to happen.  Maybe this is fine - definitely if you're four years old.  There is nothing clever at all here, hey let's kill 22 children...  isn't that awesome?  There is nothing redeeming in this at all.  Nothing Nothing.  I'll try to make this more helpful... how... if you thought Thor was a good movie and you are thinking about starting to read books - THIS might be the place to start.  Although once you've read through this rambling nonsense you're probably ready for something a step above The Hunger Games, perhaps a recipe.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Boardwalk Empire is an unflinching look at historical criminal kingpin Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson (Nelson Johnson) and the empire he ruled in Atlantic City, New Jersey during prohibition.<br />The first episode, directed by Martin Scorsese, is the most expensive pilot episode produced in television history, with a final cost of $18 million.<br />In real life Nucky ruled from about 1910 until he was imprisoned in 1941 for Income Tax evasion.<br />Nucky is the treasurer of Alantic County and a powerful political figure who keeps tabs on everything and always makes sure he gets his cut. He is a widower, who can seem to never get past the love he had for his wife, so fills that void with Lucy Danziger, a former Ziegfeid Follies dancer and other call girls.<br />All that changes when a pregnant Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald) comes to see him. She is obviously a victim of abuse, but sincerely just wants Nucky to help her husband find a job, thinking his drinking and carousing would stop. Instead Nucky gives her money, which she hides, her husband finds, and beats her causing her to lose the baby.<br />Nucky has him killed and begins a slow, awkward romance with the young Irish widow. Problems begin to surface when she pushes her pro-prohibition stance, her dislike for corrupt politics and doubt that Nucky has honorable intentions.<br />Another central character is James \\"Jimmy\\" Darmody (Michael Pitt) who returns from World War I with a bum leg, works for Nucky awhile before embarking on his own into organized crime.<br />Filled with complex characters, brilliant photography and editing, Boardwalk Empire is sure to be the new Sopranos.<br />On October 12, 2011 it was announced that the series has been renewed for a third season.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas' gradual transformation of his movies is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's gradual transformation of his face.

B004N868DS|5.0|This mouse pads pretty awesome. I used to use a 3m precise pad with the gel wrist rest and loved it but never could find another one exactly like mine before I slowly destroyed it over the years. I  ended up buying a Razer Goliathus control pad which I honestly did like, but I still longed for my old hard pad and wrist rest. Came across this Roccat Alumic on some website featuring a review on gaming mouse pads and it was pitted against the Razer Vespula. The reviewer liked this pad a ton more, the Vespula had tons of small air bubbles and based off his review I just decided I really wanted this pad, but of course when I went to buy one it was not available in the states.<br /><br />Fast-forward a year later and while browsing online the other day with a new co-worker who happens to be a huge gamer as well starts talking to me about his keyboard and mousepad. He uses a hard pad as well (a Steelseries brand) and I mention to him this Roccat Alumic I remember wanting badly, to which he replies your sure you can't buy it in the states? Look it up on Amazon right now. Low and behold it was available, so I literally had to make the purchase then and there.<br /><br />I really didn't need the new pad, but now that I have it I'm in love with it. The gel rest is a bit firmer than I would like it, and the pad is a bit larger than I would like but you could consider those pros or cons. The speed side is definitely a speed side, my Deathadder flies across with just a touch of my finger, the control side however stays true to the name and gives me the control that I originally became accustomed to with my 3M precise pad when I started my PC gaming career playing Counter-Strike (when it was a mod).
0312641893|5.0|Cover<br />Amazing cover, it suits the story perfectly, and it's gorgeous, love the red<br /><br />Characters<br />Favorite<br />This question is always the hardest for me to answer. I am usually on the side of the villain, because they make the story interesting. Even though this story had an awesome villain I think it's a tie between Cinder and Kai. They are fantastic characters they really drive this story. Cinder is so smart and protective and Kai is caring and sweet. I loved both of them so much.<br /><br />Least Favorite<br />Adri, the step mother plays the part well. I hated the thought that Cinder even had to deal with her on a daily basis. But as we all know she is a necessary character in the story of Cinderella<br /><br />Beginning<br />The reader gets to jump right into the world, jumping into Cinder's daily life and get information about the world through dialogue or actions of the characters. I love this, I have never been a fan of big info dumps. The reader is introduced to Cinder, her job as a mechanic in the market and her family and job. We also get introduced to the Prince right away and his need to have all of his affairs in order before the big ball takes place.<br /><br />Storyline<br />Cinder who is a mechanic and cyborg in the city of New Bejing, finds herself in the middle of a world being seriously threatened by the Plague. Her own sister has fallen ill and everybody is fighting for the cure. When she accepts a job from Prince Kai she soon finds herself in the middle of a galactic war in which the lunar people have been watching and preparing for.<br /><br />Ending<br />Heart pounding ending. It is like the tension being pulled in a rubber band and just about to snap. Sit on the edge of your seat kind of suspense that will leave you craving for the next book immediately. This is just the beginning of Cinder's story and I for one cannot wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Thoughts<br />I thought this story was very imaginative and very well put together. It had a growing sense of foreboding and suspense that kept me reading so fast that I never wanted to set it down. Although I did not like Adri because of how awful she treated Cinder, all of the characters were really amazing and made such an impact to the overall story. Perfect pacing and an all out enjoyable read from start to finish.<br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />\\"Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.\\"<br /><br />\\"Vanity is a factor, but it is more a question of control.

B000BBYMA2|5.0|Imagine this: a country is run by a totalitarian government, which occasionally selects groups of teenagers to methodically kill each other. On TV. Until only one remains.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\"? No, actually it's \\"Battle Royale,\\" a bloody and harrowing movie that came out several years earlier, depicting an alternate Japan where the youth are forced to kill each other. It's one of those movies that is strangely fascinating and filled with social commentary, with brilliant performances from pretty much everyone concerned.<br /><br />A class of high-schoolers are being transported on a bus, when they are gassed to unconsciousness. When they awake, they have electronic collars around their necks. A former teacher named Kitano explains that they have been chosen for the B.R. (\\"Battle Royale\\") Act, wherein teenagers are forced to fight each other to the death until only one is left standing.<br /><br />If you don't play, try to escape, refuse to kill or stray into a \\"death zone,\\" the collars explode. Each teenager is given food, water and a random item, and are set loose on a remote island.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for them to fall prey to suicide, paranoia, bombs and one student's brilliant efforts to hack the system. As the teens slowly weed each other out, Shuya Nanahara and his girlfriend Noriko try to find a way out that doesn't involve death. But if they refuse to kill, then they must escape the fascist nightmare... which no one has done before.<br /><br />\\"Battle Royale\\" (both the novel and the movie) was condemned in Japan for being so violent, and having a bunch of normal high schoolers killing each other off. But \\"Battle Royale\\" would have been striking even if it hadn't been publicized like that -- not only is it viscerally fascinating, but it asks the question straight-out: how much will people do to survive? Who would you kill to live?<br /><br />It also seems to be a story about how governments will oppress innocent people in response to the brutality of a few. However, the movie avoids any outright preaching -- instead it uncoils a tense plot, peppered with bursts of bloody violence, sexual assault and murder. There's a wild, frenetic energy to the story, and director Kinji Fukasaku unleashes it through every cold, bloodspattered scene.<br /><br />Fun trivia: Fukasaku actually lived through something almost as cold-blooded during World War II, when he saw children having to hide from bombs under EACH OTHER. The survivors had to clear away the corpses.<br /><br />Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda really give outstanding performances in this story as nice, normal, everyday kids like the ones who live down the street, but suddenly they're faced with their friends and classmates... wanting to kill them. Takeshi Kitano gives a bloodcurdlingly creepy performance as Kitano, who is nevertheless given plenty of fleshing-out (such as a fondness for one of the students).<br /><br />Violent, creepy and wonderfully atmospheric, \\"Battle Royale\\" is a brilliant cult movie that takes a look at how far people will go to stay alive.

B004KAD1ES|5.0|Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.<br /><br />But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.<br /><br />On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.<br /><br />The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?<br /><br />Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in \\"The Dark Crystal\\" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.<br /><br />Instead of some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.<br /><br />Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.<br /><br />At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (\\"Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!\\") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Crystal\\" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet. Definitely a must-see.interesting.<br /><br />Instead of some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.<br /><br />Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers.

B002ZNJWI6|4.0|6 million years ago Abigail Gentian cloned herself a thousand times and sent her copies out into the galaxy to collect knowledge and experience and share in all that they could find. 6 million years later, Abigail's civilisation is long gone but over 800 of her shatterlings still roam through space and every circuit they meet to collate knowledge, reminisce and party.<br /><br />Arriving late to the latest gathering two, somewhat wayward shatterlings, find the rendezvous planet in dust, destroyed by massive, ancient weaponry. The last remnants of Abigail Gentians massacred line flee and set about finding out just who, or what, wanted them all dead.<br /><br />House of Suns rattles along at a pretty good rate in a believable if not so fantastic universe. In Reynolds' Commonality speed of light travel hasn't been subsumed into the story by frivolous and baffling science: space travel still takes millennia. Thankfully, human artifice has reached a level that micro machines, drugs and cryogenics provide a solution to the immense distances involved in pan-galactic gargle blasting. Here too are a variety of exotic species, sentient machines, huge spaceships and entirely believable, gargantuan works and constructions: the power of stars and supernovae harnessed like intergalactic hydraulics; suns contained, switched off.<br /><br />Regardless of setting, the story itself is quite old-school and could easily translate to the old West, to a war movie or even a modern political thriller scenario; hopefully that speaks of the strengths of the story rather than its familiarity. Reynolds pulls in several wonderfully diverse characters and interweaves an intriguing back story explaining Abigail Gentian and her line. And the journey the remnant of Gentian's shatterlings take is certainly worth investing in.<br /><br />If it isn't perhaps as exciting a galaxy as some others it is nonetheless satisfying and wonderfully populated and Reynolds plays out his whodunit with intrigue, wit and style that is easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable.and style that is easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable.

1451627289|5.0|I heard a lot of 11/22/63 when I saw King winning awards for this book and the fact the rave reviews on Amazon were enticing.  Not a horror novel, King writes a time-travel novel.<br /><br />But it's not about time-travel.  Behind this science fiction landscape is a love story.  A love story that could shake the very reality of the universe if Jake Epping lets it!<br /><br />Jake gets to know Al, a strange guy who runs a hamburger joint in a small Maine town.  Al is dying of cancer and has to let someone know his plan.  Live long enough in the past to 1963 and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating Kennedy!<br /><br />Jake is not so sure about this but goes ahead to the tiny burger joint where Al shows him the stock room, which happens to have a time portal in it.  Where'd that come from?  Weird anomaly or more?<br /><br />Al tells Jake all and then perishes.  The character development is such that I really felt for Al and his major quest to stop the Kennedy assassination.  Al was hoping that we would not get into Vietnam and the country would prosper.<br /><br />Jake on the other hand wants to change the past as well.  Stop a little girl from getting hit by a bullet and get paralysis; stop a student, Harry, from having his family murdered by a drunk father; and his biggest prize, Oswald!<br /><br />I was fascinated by the fact that King weaves an easy-to-follow story where Jake meets the \\"Yellow Card Man\\" which card keeps changing color.  Who is this guy?<br /><br />Also I have seen where other reviewers remark that King drops a few Easter eggs where characters from his other novels appear - a murderous clown, or mention of Shawshank Prison.  This didn't tickle my fancy so much.  What did is King's interpretation of the late 1950s/early 1960s.<br /><br />The time period did have its friendly small towns but also had its criminal element.  Interesting that we glorify the past but forget that the past had its own problems and bad elements, which Jake finds plenty of, to his dismay.<br /><br />The majority of the book is Jake's relationship with a small-town librarian in Jolie Texas and how he will do anything to protect her and to love her.  Trouble is, there is way more at stake and I won't reveal more in the plot, other than to say the ending is troublesome and heartwrenching for the poor guy.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Not a typical horror novel and not even a typical time-travel novel, the 860+ pages fly by as you experience 1960s America and it's date with the Kennedy assassination.  What if it never happened?  What if we regret our decision?<br /><br />Recommended.of, to his dismay.<br /><br />The majority of the book is Jake's relationship with a small-town librarian in Jolie Texas and how he will do anything to protect her and to love her.

B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Written with the usual Lee Child thriller panache.  The tension builds and Jack Reacher is left second guessing his own judgement which, let's face it, doesn't happen often.

B004EPZ03Y|5.0|My two favorite Muppet movies are \\"The Muppet Movie\\" and \\"The Great Muppet Caper,\\" 2 of the 4 full length movies Jim Henson made while he was alive.  Since then, there have been many short videos and made-for-TV movies that just haven't measured up.  Thankfully, Jason Segel decided he was going to take on the challenge of writing another great movie for the Muppets.  What we end up with is classic Muppet magic.<br /><br />Muppet movies tend to fit into the stereotypical sappy feel-good movie format.  \\"The Muppets,\\" rather than trying to ignore that fact, decides to embrace it and that becomes a running joke throughout the film.  So instead of having a diabolical laugh, the character actually says, \\"Diabolical laugh.\\"  After the happy ending, everything wraps up and the villian has a change of heart, all during the closing credits.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the Muppets from \\"the good old days,\\" you'll find that pretty much all of them make an appearance, but we are still introduced to a new Muppet, Walter, who becomes our main character.  And, just like the classic movies, this film would be considered a musical, and we have a GREAT soundtrack.<br /><br />Although, the movie is not flawless.  Even though this is a children's movie, I feel the story was a little rushed and could have easily been another 15-20 minutes.  Because of this, there were some aspects of the story that weren't fully explained in the interest of time.  The most notable being the relationship between Piggy and Kermit.  Though you could make the arguement that since this isn't the point of the film, it's not as important.<br /><br />These few weak points are still not enough to take away a star.  The movie was funny, entertaining, and fit very well into the classic Muppet style.  Muppet fans, young and old, will love this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the first installment of the Fifty Shades Trilogy that is truly an obsessively overwhelming story of love for both characters Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. While it's an extremely downhearted, unconventional developing relationship between the two, it's also an intensely absorbing passionate journey. If you've ever been addicted to anything in your life, the similarities are invoked in this can't-live-without, absolutely addicting relationship! From experience, this fictional narrative is so true-to-life that you absolutely will not be able to put this book down: breathtaking, heartbreaking, passionate, dangerous, codependent mannerisms, dark peculiarities, and loss of self-being are all the traits that make this story so powerful. To give up oneself whole-heartedly to any one person is dangerously hazardous to a person's being, and that is exactly what happens in this tale.  The eccentricities and abnormalities of this story's thesis and the erogenous territory it treads, make for one intriguing read. And so the story begins...<br /><br />Christian Grey is a multi-millionaire young entrepreneur who is dumbfounded when Anastasia (Ana) Steele walks into his office for an interview for her college newspaper. Ana who is finishing up her senior year in college stepped up for her roommate to get some notes on Mr. Grey, while her roommate suffers at home with the flu. Unbeknownst to Ana, Christian is amused and mesmerized by her appearance and subtleties. And after she leaves his office, he will begin his quest on literally tracking Ana down just to appease his attraction for her.  Upon his pursuit and according to his plan, he and Ana once again coincidently meet. And it will be from this moment on when Christian asks Anastasia to join him for coffee that the most erotically breathtaking unity of two people originates.<br /><br />It is truly one of the most emotionally compelling developing relationships ever told...bittersweet to be sure. For you see, Christian has a very dark, deep-seeded past that has wounded him psychologically, which causes his behavior (the fifty shades) to be sporadic, aloof, alienated, and threateningly domineering (Dom). And this is also where the BDSM undertone enters into the story. While this is not, per se, a BDSM novel, it does give insight to the possibilities of becoming just that. It is a one-of-a-kind horrifically carnal, intensely passionate uncharacteristic love story. Couple that with two of the most profound characters and you have one brilliant narrative! Extremely overpowering premise! Highly Recommend!istian has a very dark, deep-seeded past that has wounded him psychologically, which causes his behavior (the fifty shades) to be sporadic, aloof, alienated, and threateningly domineering (Dom).

0439023513|5.0|I am not going to lie I expected a perfectly cheery ending that had Katniss choosing her love and still staying close with the other and her family after her personal vendetta is achieved. I read the ending shocked at what transpired but I felt the truth in every second of it. You killed people for others entertainment then when you somehow survive the odds yor are made to be nothing more then what you were for the enemy and this is by your so called friends. She fought to save those around her but never completely succeeded. If anyone experiences half of the things she saw even in the first two books and don't completely lose your mind then you may be a sociopath. Logically she finally breaks down at the end with Buttercup in her arms realizing everything that happens.<br /><br />If she came back cheery and bubble I would have not believed it. Her victory ending would be laughable at the experience of her hardship. She changes and has her issues and so does Peeta and they hold each other to reality. They can really only rely on each other and Katniss realizes the boy with the bread really is her love. He kept her strong gave her something to continue fighting for after everything. If you have not gotten your fairy tail ending think of this: Katniss and the rest of her group miraculously make it through the Capitol of hell and somehow Batman their way into Snow's Mansion then execute him as the hovercrafts arrive just in time to extract them and they go home and Katniss picks whoever she wants and lives with smiling faces. I would have been dumbfounded by Collins choice to \\"deus ex machina\\" her characters out of what is a relatable true event that only a inhuman character could get out of. Yes its fantasy, but its a fantasy filled with real humans and believable characters. There is no Superman. I would never have believed her.<br /><br />Also in my mind I see happiness at the end. She could not stay with Gale, there was just something there that would have torn herapart. He could never fully understand her pain. She really does find her love (and this is where the only issue of the book arises). Katniss really did love Peeta since the cave. They relied on each other and bonded in a way only true hardship can do to a group. Once she realizes she needs him to not only return to the human world but to be happy she finally is. Yes the ending should have been longer with the two slowly becoming each other's true connection to the world. But I still feel the joy between them. Maybe it is the optimist in me but I think they find true love in each other. They suffer and make it through together being each other's strength and idealism. Haymitch becomes part of their strange family and they live truly the best they can. I like to think (though never described) that the two of them did see her mother and Gale on occasion, even Paylor, who does become the strong though grounded leader the new free world deserves do to Katniss's last saving action. Those others may not see it but she gave the new world the best possible start she could.<br /><br />Yes Katniss becomes a murderer but she does it out of safety for the future. She really does save the colonies both through inspiration and her final Mockingjay act to save the world from another Snow in different skin. She really is the victor, though she scarifies what could have been her normal life to save the colonies from tyranny. Even if she did not watch her sister and those in the third book die she would have been far from cheery and normal with the nightmares of the arena still ever etched into her mind. She exemplifies what soldiers do give up for their homes. There normalcy and sanity to bring freedom and unity. She destroyed her image to the public allowing them to move on still somewhere in their hearts remembering the Mockingjay that unified them. She escapes the public eye and lives the life she wants (minus the loss of sanity). She becomes a believable hero that suffers fromreal people problems. Collins does not sugar coat things because they are not sugar coated in the normal world. She makes a character that can be looked up to and believed at the same time. Even young Katniss Everdeen can save the world because she always will be the girl on fire.
B005PR2FD8|4.0|I was debating on giving this 3 instead of 4 stars, but, the more I thought about it, the more I realized the movie actually was pretty decent. The movie is 90 minutes, and, considering there are only like three fights, it can seem a bit dragged out or slow at some points. The 3rd fight can technically be split into 3, but, since it's between the same 3 charachers, I'm combining them into one. I really did enjoy the fights though. My biggest wish would have been to see at least a few more characters with a few more fights thrown in. With only 7 of them present, you pretty know who going to fight whom. Nina and Ana start the movie off with a battle, and it looked like they were going to have another showdown later in the movie...which they did. It just wasn't shown. -_-

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|In fact, I am tempted to say \\"ditto\\".  I too have been a huge long-time fan...1974.  I think Bruce's first eight records - through Tunnel of Love - are the very best first eight ever produced by any musical artist (and I am a big fan of all kinds of music, including jazz and classical).  Human Touch and Lucky Town were very disappointing, *but*, if the best of the two had been combined and produced differently, I would put them in the same class.  Then came Ghost of Tom Joad.  I love about two-thirds of that record, so - while it was a bit disappointing in it's \\"inconsistency\\" - I still come back and enjoy it a lot from time to time.<br /><br />Okay...I'm going to fast-forward here a little bit.  I *love* much of Tracks (1/2 to 2/3), I loved The Rising (albeit with glaring weaknesses like Let's Be Friends), and was ok with Seeger, Devils..., Magic, Working on a Dream and The Promise.  All of them had some \\"clunkers\\" IMHO, but they also had some very good songs.  (as an aside, I don't go back to Magic or Working, because the compression spoils the music for me...also, I would MUCH rather listen to the 2nd \\"The Promise\\" disc than Wrecking Ball).<br /><br />So....I am very, very disappointed with Wrecking Ball.  There is no song I find myself wanting to listen to again, and I would put them all in the \\"mediocre\\" category.  When I listen to them, I find myself thinking of other, much better Bruce songs.  AND - while this has been a problem I've had with much of the latter half of Bruce's career - I am finally almost completely turned off by repetitious repetitious repetitious \\"la la la\\" and \\"na na na\\" choruses.  I mean \\"this is the same guy who gave us those first eight great (plus) records\\"?<br /><br />Honestly: I feel sad.  Friends of mine seem to mostly know this latter-half Bruce, and they sometimes lovingly mock my love for his music.  I'm sad, because their point of view gets clearer and clearer all the time. (to say nothing of the sadness of not having more wonderful songs that I can't wait to hear any more)<br /><br />p.s. My review has nothing to do with politics.  I am liberal through and through.

B003L20ICE|1.0|I (kind of) didn't like the spoiled and pompous characters the director created for this film -it was hard to feel a lot of empathy for them. I still like Cholodenko a lot and feel she's a real artist. She used to be edgier though, and that's what appealed to me the most about her art. This film was not as engrossing as some of her other works.

B005K0HDGE|3.0|I've never read a Stephen King, before, though that's a matter of not getting around to a genre I didn't think I'd enjoy, more than anything else. On the strength of a friend's strong recommendation I got this ebook and I'm not sorry, but I would have enjoyed the book more if it had more to do with the Kennedy assassination and less to do with the main character's life and loves.<br /><br />King is good at drawing in the reader--as I'd always heard, and he's also good at spinning the unlikely into the believable, I now know.<br /><br />Most valuable to me in this book is the theme of our constant desire to change the past, and how this shapes us and our world--we don't have to stumble on a \\"rabbit hole\\" for this to feature big in our human nature. I like best how Jake comes to terms with his own regret and his temptation to try to fix all the ills he knows of and and feels he can influence. Somewhat interesting, too, is the fairly obvious conclusion it would be dangerous to meddle in the events of the past if we had the chance.<br /><br />I don't feel especially satisfied with how Kennedy's assassination figures in the book. It seems to me King had to decide in favour of a lone gunman to make the premise of the book operable, and his closing essay supporting the conclusions of the Warren Commission comes across as self-justifying. So you have to be irrational to believe otherwise? I'm not a conspiracy theorist in general but on this one, puh-lleaase.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I bought this book by accident.  I was looking for another book and couldn't remember the exact title and ended up buying this book instead.  About a quarter of the way through I realized I was reading the wrong book, but frankly didn't care.  It was just too good.<br /><br />I always think I'll hate stories about fighters.  I mean there is the punching, the blood, the broken bones, and the swelling, but always there is something humanizing about someone who gives into that part too.  This is not your typical love story.  They know they are not the best for each other, but you root for them anyway.<br /><br />I laughed, cried, held my breath a few times, and was physically sick with worry over this couple.  And I don't get that way too often when I read books.  I stayed up late last night to finish the book knowing I had a lot to do today and little time to do it and yet, I still had to make time to write a review so people would buy this book with some confidence.<br /><br />There are some minor flaws -- the dialogue was formatted oddly in my opinion which made it difficult to tell who was saying what.  And this is the strangest piece of criticism I'll give -- the ending went on too long, but I didn't want it to end, so I was kind of ok with this.<br /><br />I hope to read more by this author.

B005FITIDC|5.0|After reading the editorial review, I was a little miffed to say the least.  This isn't just some story that Hollywood made up.  This is a man's REAL LIFE story.  Just because it fits or doesn't fit into some quaint box that you've made for it, doesn't make it any less real.  I've met Sam and he's been to speak at our church.  This is what he's been called to do and unless you've walked in this man's shoes, don't judge him! The movie was well done and yes, not widely distributed because it is controversial.  Gerard Butler and Michelle Monaghan did a wonderful job portraying these real life people.  It's a little dicey in the beginning and I was thinking maybe I shouldn't have brought my 15 y.o. daughter to see it with the violence, drug abuse, sex scene and cursing but it was his life and she's met Sam so she knows how he has changed.  It lets you see the atrocities being done to these people in other parts of the world and how Sam and others are helping them too.  Whatever you may think of helping \\"African children\\" doesn't matter. They are still humans who live real life and should be protected and cared for and loved like you love one of your own.  Absolutely worth seeing!
B004J80CTI|5.0|I was particularly interested in obtaining this CD for the Prokofiev Sonata No. 7. Ms. Benelli-Mosell does indeed give a fine account of this work, including the Precipitato where she maintains a driving tempo right to the conclusion.<br /><br />The highlight of the disc for me though is the wonderful reading of the Scriabin Sonata No. 1 (Op. 6), where she gets to the heart of this piece with it's wonderful sonorities and thematic variations. Exquisite playing!<br /><br />The Haydn Sonata No. 34 in E-minor shows off her versatility. I was not familiar with the Liszt Rhapsodie Espagnole (S 254) before this, but once again the playing is captivating and of the highest order in my opinion.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this very fine CD.
B00288KNJU|4.0|if it weren't for the red & blue 3D glasses that come with this movie (and it had come with different ones like in the theaters) i would've rated this 5 stars. i was surprised to see the glasses and find out that there was a 3D version on the disc, and that my bluray player & tv would play it, because there was nothing on the packaging that would suggest there was a 3D version included (i bought mine at bestbuy). i watched it with the glasses that came with it; the coloring of the movie is all skewed due to the blue & red and my eyes had a very hard time focusing. i had to keep pausing the movie, taking the glasses off & look at other things/walk around a bit. even though i did that, after the movie was over i was dizzy and felt a little sick. the movie itself is great, i've always loved it. but as long as i have these blue & red glasses that came with the movie i'll be sticking to the bluray version only. they should've included 3D glasses that wouldn't affect the colors of the movie because the hue/tint of the movie sets the tone quite a bit.

0449011151|4.0|I often find myself explaining to people what to expect when reading [[ASIN:B000JMLFLW Pride and Prejudice]]. While I think it is a delightful book, the style is different from what someone who has read only modern novels might expect.  And it's not just Austen.  Ann Radcliffe's [[ASIN:1420933108 The Mysteries of Udolpho]], a late 18th century best seller gothic novel has some similar points of style although not nearly (by a long shot) as well written. There is not much direct dialogue between characters and the author's voice comes into play telling the reader what he or she should think about the character of the persons described.<br /><br />This book is a pastiche of Austen's Pride and Prejudice although set at a later date after Darcy has married Elizabeth Bennett and they have lived for some time at Pemberley. On the eve of a traditional ball named after Darcy's deceased mother, Lady Ann, everything is set askew by the unexpected arrival of Lydia, Elizabeth's sister, in hysterics.<br /><br />I gave it 3 1/2 star rounded up to 4 because it was a lot better than some of the other efforts to continue the lives of Austen's characters.  While I've read most of James' books including her co-authored retelling of the 1811 Ratcliffe Highway Murders, [[ASIN:0446679216 The Maul and the Pear Tree]] I didn't really expect her to reach anywhere close to Austen's wit-- and I was right.  But I did get an afternoon's and evenings entertainment out of it.  And I also enjoyed the understated references to [[ASIN:1612930859 Persuasion]], one of my favorite Austen novels.<br /><br />As Pride and Prejudice was mainly written from Elizabeth's view point, this novel focuses on Darcy.  While Pride and Prejudice focused on the interior world of the characters, this book focuses on the exterior, bringing in early 19th century forensics and jurisprudence.<br /><br />Someone mentioned whether at the time this is set if the defendant was allowed to testify at his own trial.  The defendant in fact had to answer the prosecution on his own behalf, but he was not placed under oath.  Witnesses as to his character and the events the trial concerned were allowed to testify under oath.<br /><br />I listened to the Audible version which is read by Rosalyn Landor.  She does a good if not stellar job.  There was at least one point where I became confused as to which male character was supposed to be speaking.<br /><br />Expect a book written in a late 18th-early 19th century style.  Don't expect the level of Austen's own work. Don't expect a modern mystery.  Do consider reading The Maul and the Pear Tree if you are interested in what the investigation of a murder was actually like.

B0007939NO|5.0|This is one of those marvelous old fashioned musicals that just take your breath away. Great songs, colorful costumes, singing, dancing, and the merest of plots.  Everyone knows the story: Brigadoon appears once every hundred years, and that century is a day in the life of villagers. Gene Kelly and Van Johnson stumble upon it. Gene meets Cyd. They dance. Gene loses Cyd. They Dance. Gene gets Cyd. They dance. The plot is not essential to enjoyment.<br /><br />Watch Gene Kelly tapdance on the green grass and dusty road.  Watch him spin Cyd across some of the cheesiest sets ever constructed on a Hollywood lot.  None of it matters. This is a soppy, wonderful,romantic Lerner and Loewe musical. Just sit back and enjoy it. It's almost like being in love.<br /><br />The movie is an adaptation of the 1947 Lerner and Loewe Broadway musical, which didn't feature any of the film's cast. There have been many adaptations of this lovely relic.  Robert Goulet and Peter Falk  starred in a TV version back in the 60s. This used more songs from the original show and picked up 5 Emmys. The additional songs make listening to Goulet almost worthwhile.<br /><br />The best television adaptation, however, was done by Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel. When the foursome goes to Scotland, Lucy dreams she is in Brigadoon...but a very Lucy-fied version of the elusive highland village.  Initially welcomed by the townspeople because she is a returning McGilicuddy, little does she realize why her visit makes everyone so happy.  Turns out, if the resident two-headed dragon doesn't nosh on a McGilicuddy every 100 years, the town will vanish. Fred and Ethel are the dragon, and Ricky is the hero who sings \\"I'm In Love With The Dragon's Dinner.\\" How wonderful is it?  Better than the grape stomping episode, better than the candy factory, and right up there with the William Holden Episode where Lucy sets fire to her nose.  And that's way up there.<br /><br />Brigadoon. The place to be. Wherever it is.

0307888908|4.0|The title of the book is probably not the most descriptive, although the authors cite many examples of entrepreneurs who start-up great companies. But the connection from a company start-up process to a \\"self start-up\\" process just isn't there. What is there, however, is an in-depth review of the importance of one's personal and professional networks in building careers. While that seems like a \\"duh!\\" in this age, and goes without saying, the book does conceptualize the importance of networks in a way that is useful. What this book is--and perhaps its greatest value--is a user guide to making the network capabilities of LinkedIn work powerfully for you. After reading the book, I did think of my own professional networks differently than before. And that was helpful. The title of the book should have been something like \\"The Network of You.\\"
B007IQX1G4|2.0|I didn't think it was funny. I was bored. I just kept thinking what a loser the main character was and how amazingly embarrassing her behavior was.

It is just a bad, sad and boring drama. THERON is better than this.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|\\"The Adventures of Tintin\\", Spielberg's adaptation of Herge's \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\", is both a worthy tribute to the original stories and a fine family adventure movie in its own right.<br /><br />From the viewpoint of a longtime Tintin fan, I would say that this film is far more faithful to the original works -- including the depiction of the characters' personalities. After the hatchet job done on Aragorn's personality -- turning him into an embarrassingly weak, cowardly, furtive buffoon in the Lord of the Rings movies from the forthright, fearless leader he was in the books -- I feared that Peter Jackson's involvement would result in mangling of the characterizations.<br /><br />However, all of the characters retain their identifiable traits; many of the scenes from the books are reproduced very closely in the movie; and nowhere, in my opinion, is the spirit of Herge violated.<br /><br />A few shortcuts are taken in the film to link up plot points that took a lot more exposition in the books, and in fact, the film blends several books together. However, without making the film 10 hours or more long, it would have been impossible to follow the plot exactly. The \\"abbreviations\\" are handled smoothly and preserve much of the original story in a slightly more streamlined form.<br /><br />The film producers did alter several major details of the story, and this is ground that I'm less confident of giving 100% praise to. Sakharine is made the descendent of Red Rackham and the owner of Marlinspike Hall, rather than the Bird Brothers in the latter case. This does make a more complete story, however, and is in my opinion<br /><br />The seemingly much-loathed duel between cranes at the end is a new addition, but I fail to see what the furor is about. It is hardly \\"over the top\\" by the standards of either Hollywood or Herge. In the original books, we have people using crystal balls full of magic powder to attack scientists and put them into a coma-like trance that allowedthem to be tortured from thousands of miles away; others rolling off a cliff in huge snowballs; rivers full of piranha-aggressive alligators; and all sorts of weird action. The only reason Herge didn't have a fight between cranes is that he didn't think of it -- it's right up the alley of a Tintin story, as far as I can see.<br /><br />The one thing that bothers me a bit is Castafiore (sp.) shattering the glass with her singing. It sounds like something that might be included in a Tintin story, but on the other hand, it just sort of came out of nowhere. She showed up for no very good reason, broke the glass, and vanished from the scene. Still, it's a minor hiccup at best, not anything catastrophic.<br /><br />In effect, the plot was tweaked to fit into the movie and make a more complete story than would have been shown in the limited time. But the personalities of the characters, the whole Herge atmosphere with a mix between investigation and action, and the look and feel of both the people and the scenery all capture what a Tintin movie should look like. A superb, well-crafted film that is respectful to the genius of the original while bringing it vividly to the screen. Herge would have been thrilled, in my opinion -- the movie vindicates his statement that only Spielberg could do justice to his creation.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|As we all know, this wasn't the same Whitney who used to give us goose bumps when we heard some of her old material for the first time. She had aged & maybe hadn't taken the best care of herself for many years. However, I really do enjoy a good percentage of the songs on this album. Million Dollar Bill - a good dance song & fun to sing along with. I \\"love\\" Call You Tonight - a great beat. I Look to you - simply inspirational. A Song For You - well done cover song. I Didn't Know My Own Strength - wonderful, beautiful! I would say 6 out of 11 songs are pretty great! I was planning to purchase this album when it was originally released in 2009, but for some reason I never did. I was always a big Whitney fan since her debut in 1985 & had owned most of her albums except for Just Whitney & this one. The vocals are a bit stronger on Just Whitney, but I do think this album is better overall. There will never be another entertainer who touched us so deeply with that BODYGUARD soundtrack........I still get the chills when I hear some of those songs. Everyone makes poor decisions in life. The people who judge her should remember how hard it must be to be on the TOP OF THE WORLD at one point in his or her career & then to be at the very BOTTOM. I give her much credit, that she continued to provide us with some good music even though her voice may have not SOARED as in the past. Everyone grows old & we lost a legend at such a young age. I urge people to buy this album....give it a chance.....listen to the words.......it will grow on you & you may even LOVE it..........We will miss you Whitney........one of the BEST.......I will always love you & your exceptional music!

As a result, a significant body of case-law has been generated by the new court and subsequently by the Court of Appeal.<br /><br />With a view to ensuring that this body of case law is made more readily available to a wider audience, the decision has been made that the new Court of Protection Reports are to be published quarterly, starting in 2012, thereby making them more accessible to lawyers and other professional groups concerned with the welfare of vulnerable adults as well as children.<br /><br />The major cases decided before 2012 have been compiled and presented in their entirety in this volume, except of course, that the names of the vulnerable parties themselves are omitted.  This book is therefore referred to by the Editor in Chief as a `preliminary volume' and as such, it consolidates over fifty key cases reported since the Mental Capacity Act 2005 was implemented.<br /><br />For those professional groups involved with any issues pertaining to vulnerable adults or children, this volume of over 1,200 pages is an invaluable resource.  Besides a table of cases, there is a detailed listing of subject matter,  The most common issues, it would seem, include deprivation of liberty...enduring power of attorney...medical treatment... practice and procedure...property and affairs...housing and much, much more. The extensive index of over fifty pages includes additional tables of cases, namely those reported in this volume.<br /><br />There's no doubt that the publication of this important work of reference by Jordans -- and the subsequent quarterly reports --  will enhance public understanding of scope and variety of the challenging work undertaken by the Court of Protection and the way in which it operates.

B006Z2WE0G|3.0|This novel was well written and the events were well researched. The story itself has some tear-jerking moments, especially if you are a mother. For the most part, I couldn't put the book down. However, the main character seemed a bit weak to me, a pushover of sorts. I found myself wanting to slap her at times, for she let herself be treated horribly by her husband and in-laws. It's hard for me to appreciate a character such as her, but it didn't really take away from the actual story, which definitely carries with it a lesson to be learned. And she did do a very brave thing by shedding light on a dark event. I would recommend this book for sure, but I doubt I would read it again.

There's also vital input from medicine, social work and sociology as an academic discipline.<br />Intriguingly, there are comments from users of the family law services who do much to broaden the diverse range of opinion, experience and insight offered in this publication.<br /><br />Papers like these pave the way for future policy in family law and are well worth perusing, not to mention quoting from. To cite only a few examples, Plenary 1 of the Conference dealt with `Private Law: a change from Confrontation to Mediation'.  Hearing the voice of the child in both private and public law proceedings was another key area discussed, as well as the reform of the family court and legal aid reform.<br /><br />A particularly impressive aspect of this Conference was Plenary 8, containing the nineteen resolutions which emanated from the wealth of research and information shared.

In the words of the learned editors of this authoritative work of reference, an international trust...has `a connection of legal significance with two or more countries' where -- to offer one example -- an individual from one country may create a trust governed by the laws of another country wherein which he or she may have worked or settled.<br /><br />Originating mainly from the common law countries -- primarily Britain and the regions over which she held imperial sway - trusts, for a number of historical reasons, have taken hold in a number of non-common law jurisdictions as well.<br />The introduction to this volume of almost 1,000 pages mentions that a number of offshore centres have generated a remarkable quantity of trust legislation `designed unashamedly to attract trust business.'  The private trust, for instance, has been adapted in a number of regions to support individuals and enterprises in today's competitive international and commercial environments.<br /><br />The trust as a concept is widely accepted and understood, yet despite its popularity and the fact that it works, it continues to defy precise definition.  `With a concept so definitionally amphorous as the trust, ` says one of the learned contributors to this book `there are likely also to be the doctrinal developments that are welcomed in one jurisdiction but rejected as unacceptable in others,'<br /><br />This has certainly happened in Commonwealth countries, notably Canada.  These and a host of other issues pertaining to international trusts are examined and analysed in this useful book.<br /><br />Logically divided into four parts, the book works efficiently as a research tool, with its detailed table of contents and index.  Part I contains the conflict of laws chapters, each extensively updated.  Part II, also updated, includes the latest developments in such areas as trusts and finance law and money laundering and trusts.<br /><br />Particularly topical is Part III, which deals with Italy and China, while Part IV is the very erudite and quotable contribution by Professor Donovan Waters who, in his chapter on the future of the trust, makes some rather fascinating references to the past.<br /><br />Delving into the theory and practice of international trusts while presenting an interesting historical perspective, this book will certainly enhance one's understanding of trusts in general and international trusts in particular. The research sources are massive, including tables of cases, of national legislation and of conventions and EU materials. The Appendix contains The Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition 1985.<br /><br />If you practice in the area of international trust law, this new third edition of `The International Trust' is a must-have purchase.

Compiled in one handy hardback volume, this publication brings together some of the best learned commentary from the US on this often vexed and controversial subject.<br /><br />Part of Edward Elgar's admirable `Corporate Law' series, this engrossing collection of articles offers both a theoretical and historical perspective on insider trading.  If you're doing research, or need some background on this subject, editor Stephen J. Bainbridge has cherry picked a collection of some of the most interesting articles on insider trading published in the US over a period of forty years or so, so you don't have to.  How handy is that?<br /><br />Even though American, the articles have equal relevance in the UK and indeed in any country which has a developed capital market, as you are reminded by the editor that the United States was once virtually alone in aggressively prosecuting insider trading and that `even today, US insider trading law remains distinctive in the strict nature of its restrictions and in the vigor (sic.) with which it enforces them.'<br /><br />Rigorous regulation of insider trading, however, has apparently generated a spirited debate, primarily in America of all places, not on the morality or immorality of insider trading but on its practicability and its effectiveness.<br /><br />Some commentators, notably one Henry G. Manne back in 1960s, have argued against a prohibition against insider trading, thus generating tsunamis of indignation on the part of other commentators and academics who vociferously disagree. `Why insider dealing is wrong,' intones one article mentioned in the book's extensive bibliography. As the editor points out, insider trading is one of the most controversial issues in securities regulation, citing the examples of Japan and Hong Kong where, in the latter case, insider trading prohibition has been repealed.<br /><br />`It would be helpful to gather data on the effect of insider trading on investor confidence,' concludes the editor. Well yes, it would -- and our question is, where is all this data?  Oddly, this book published in 2011 contains no articles, nor does its bibliography cite any article published after 2000 -- or maybe we've missed something hence the view that this work is of historic importance to the ongoing debate.<br /><br />Perhaps the next compilation published on this subject will advance the insider trading debate much further, with some more recent legislative developments and research, particularly since the regulatory/compliance framework has recently changed.  Anyone involved in any way with financial services (like half of London) will await such a volume with eager anticipation as we all labour under the gaze and control of 21st century regulation and all it currently encompasses.wrong,' intones one article mentioned in the book's extensive bibliography.

B0030EWB96|5.0|It is hard to find a more impressive player of any instrument, anywhere, than Hiromi.  Some may criticize her for being a bit too flashy with virtuosity (and admittedly, a lot of the tracks are quite flashy), but then there are more subdued pieces like Place to Be, Somewhere, and Sicilian Blue which make you realize what she's capable of.  There really isn't an uninteresting track on the entire album, and for a solo album, you'll never feel like you wished for someone to accompany her.<br /><br />The only potential downside to this album is that if you're a Hiromi fan, and you've some YouTube or live performances of some of these pieces, the improv sections may be less amazing than what you're used to from her.  I blame this primarily on the CD format being able to hold only so many minutes, or perhaps it's that in performing these pieces live since their recording for this album, she has pushed the boundaries a bit more or expanded on her ideas.  Either way, this is still one of the best jazz albums I've ever heard.  If you're at all interested, buy it -- you won't regret it.
0857935151|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3PPO8MTYI2VSL]]<br />THIS BOOK EXPLORES AN EXCEPTIONALLY WIDE RANGE OF BIODIVERSITY ISSUES FOCUSSED ON THE LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The biodiversity of our planet -- the symbiotic relationship between plants and animals and therefore eco-systems -- sustains our existence.  Anything that threatens it threatens us -- and there are lots of threats out there.<br /><br />Some commentators have even used the term `extinction crisis' referring to the rapid depletion of any number of species worldwide. While all this may sound alarmist, it does reflect the general level of concern on these matters on the part of, certainly the academic community and/or those involved with the vast range of issues concerning our natural heritage.<br /><br />Recently published by Edward Elgar Publications, Alexander Gillespie's book explores the issues surrounding loss of biodiversity issues from a range of viewpoints.  The author is famously erudite -- and not only in international law pertaining to biodiversity issues. He also explores this vast and complex subject matter from other perspectives, notably the scientific, the philosophical and the political.<br /><br />This much needed multi-disciplinary approach reveals `the wider picture', one might say, and may point the way to eventually solving or resolving many of the planet's most pressing environmental problems. `The solutions can only be global,' as Gillespie points out.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts with Part Three being of particular interest, covering as it does, the various environmental threats, from habitat loss and alien species (e.g. pests) to threats from modern processes.<br /><br />Produced with the assistance of the New Zealand Law Foundation, the focus of the book is of course on law, yet at the same time it insists that `a solid understanding of scientific backgrounds' not to mention `a dash of philosophy', are the recipe for success' in achieving conservationist goals aimed at protecting the environment. Quite rightly in our view, Gillespie takes a dim view of conservation without science.  It's to be hoped that those opinionated folk who call themselves environmentalists will eventually agree.<br /><br />The `spine' of the book, says the author, are the treaties it examines -- at least a hundred of them -- pertaining to the environment.  In fact, there would appear to be at least double that number listed at the front.  If you want to look something up, there is a usefully detailed index at the back - 21 pages in all -- so much scope and guidance here for your own research.<br /><br />The book is an important contribution to environmental literature and specifically to environmental law internationally.  International lawyers, both practitioners and academic lawyers alike -- as well as policy makers -- will welcome this thorough, scholarly and readable monograph as a must-have addition to their libraries.

1401937519|3.0|Dying to Be Me by Anita Moorjani  is an interesting account of a young woman's near death experience and it's significance to the rest of her life.  It's a short little book but hardly a \\"quick read\\" with some profound insights into the impact of our thinking on our life and health.  Ms. Moorjani reveals much about her early life experiences and development of her thinking process from childhood as a prelude to her account of her life changing experience with cancer, dying and returning to living. One of her earliest memories was overhearing an adult conversation expressing the disappointment in having a female child. During her early years as a child in Hong Kong she was the object of rejection and bullying in the private schools she attended because of her Indian looks and Hindu religion and suffered feelings of rejection and fear. She developed a strong character and determination to be as perfect as possible in order to please as many people as she could and excelled in her studies and aspired to go to college.  She resisted her cultural path to become a skilled housewife in an arranged marriage and was rejected by her community in spite of the support of her family.  She finally met the man of her dreams who embraced her independence and was part of the Indian community in Hong Kong.  After a brief period of peace and comfort her best friend and brother-in-law were diagnosed and after lengthy and agonizing chemotherapy, succumbed to cancer.  Her fears returned with a vengeance and culminated in her own diagnosis of lymphoma.  The next four years were a living hell of fear and anxiety with the exception of a brief respite in India at an Ayurveda  retreat.  When she returned home she was greatly improved but the benefit was short lived when she encountered the negativity of her friends and family and within a few months  she was rushed to the hospital unable to breathe or even lift her own head and soon lapsed into a coma.  While unconscious she had her life changing experience which ultimately resulted in her decision to return to her physical form for a total healing of her disease and a completely new perspective on her life and left in the universe as a whole.  This book must be read with an open mind and heart in order to receive the message and benefit the author intends for the reader to hear.  This is a book capable of changing the reader's life, and the author's epiphany, if embraced by the reader, could result in a more peaceful and healthier existence for all.

There are distractions and a fire alarm when guests scatter and Poppy loses sight of her ring.<br /><br />Things get worse later on when a cyclist rides by and snatches her cell phone out of her hands. Poppy spots a discarded cell phone in a rubbish bin and latches on to it in her life saving attempt to find her ring before her fiance's parents arrive in town. The phone works, but Poppy soon finds out it belongs to some one's personal assistant, who obviously ditched it on her way out of one job to another.<br /><br />Sam Roxton wants his assistant's phone back but Poppy persuades him to let her use it until she finds her ring. He agrees when she promises to forward him all his new messages, which his personal assistant used to handle on this phone. What happens later is amusing - Poppy reads the email, sends email, replies to email, and gets herself involved in Sam's personal life as well as his company's politics.<br /><br />A hilarious and entertaining romance, I want to read more of Sophie Kinsella's books!
006145205X|3.0|This was a thought provoking book and as a pessimist myself, I did find that this book tempered my outlook on life in general, and I find myself retreating back to it time after time to alleviate gloomy thoughts. However, Ridley's book-just the same as with everyone out there-should not be taken as the bible as it has some untenable statements and arguements. As pointed out by others, the book essentially rests on the arguement: When things get bad, we always find our way out of trouble. And indeed he backs this thesis up with plenty of scenarios, but I don't think we should rely on an empty statement like this when it comes to a possible disaster scenario. Seems reckless to me. Think about applying this logic to our own lives. Ya, I'll eat lard out of a can for the next 30 years, but once the time comes, I'm sure they'll have a solution for my plaque-filled arteries. In health, prevention is the best cure. In the health of the environment, I think this is sound logic as well. Old growth forest, coral reefs and rainforests don't really recover very quickly and won't be able to get much assistance from any human-devised solution.<br /><br />I cannot possible include a criticism of every statement he utters; theres a profusion of them, and that is why it's such a riveting read. But as one with a biological and health-related background, I'll critique those in my scope of knowledge.<br /><br />1. On p. 298 Ridley states that chemical pollution is responsible for at most %2 of cancers, obviously excluding smoking from falling in this category, which is debatable. It's hard to be optimistic in oncology and it took some courage on Ridley's part for getting involved in this topic. Or maybe he's just callous. I feel that even 1 preventable cancer case should be treated as the world since so much is at stake. And 2% of deaths attributed to synthetic chemical-caused cancer is 11,000 deaths. If one were you, how upset would you be that your death could have been prevented because of our wrecklessness in creating chemicals and not testing them? Of course, 2% is the low number. Indeed, a bit of googling and I find that it is the LOWEST number I could find. The high number is 20%. Now were talking about 111,000 people who die of synethic chemical-caused cancer. Wow, makes quite a big difference huh? This doesn't strike me as surprising at all. In West Virginia, a town of some 30 people had 7 cases of brain cancer (victims not related, although you may be tempted to make some jokes at that) because of their proximity to a coal mine. In my state of Mass, there is a concentration of cancer cases around a former army base, indeed the highest in the state. Mill works suffer from nasal cancer, theres mesothelioma and of course leukemia, which seems like its only due to chemicals. That is all I have to say about that.<br /><br />2. On p. 340, Ridley states that coral reefs are fine. I doubt this. Again a google search finds that coral reefs are dying, and not reforming, as Ridley hoped. He states that coral reefs actually become more hardy if they undergo temperature changes, but this has yet to be the case. In 8 years of measurements done on a coral reef by National Geographic, the coral hasn't regenerated a little bit. Coral reefs died off 12 years ago in the Maldives from a sudden warming, and they have to artifically regenerate them because they aren't doing them by theirselves. And bleaching, Ridly, by definition is a process that happens slowly, not rapidy. The coral will not adjust. And yes the very warm Persian Gulf has coral reefs, but I sincerely doubt they're are the same species as the corals in the rest of the world. Coral reefs can also take anywhere from 3,500 years, to 140,000 to grow. Even if we take the species from the Persian Gulf and propagate them in other places, it won't work that well.<br /><br />So, if he was wrongly optimistic about these 2 things, which I am by no means an expert in but made an effort to critique, whatelse was he \\"wildly\\" optimistic in, to use his own phrasing that he lambasted my beloved Edward O. Wilson with? I saw err on the side of caution when it comes to such high-risk scenarios.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I was very impressed by this. I've heard of the books before (George R. R. Martin seems to be legendary in the genre) but I've never been interested in authors who name their fantasy characters \\"Ned\\" or, for that matter, \\"Richard\\". But out my respect for H.B.O. quality shows (Rome comes to mind) and on the word of several who've claimed Game of Thrones is a darker, more serious Legend of the Seeker, I bought it. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />For starters, I feel like I should dispell a few exaggerations people have made about this show (or book). It's H.B.O., so there's sex. But it far more tamed in comparison to other of their shows, and in comparison to Showtime's The Tudors, it's practically non-existant. So much is going on throughout the show that they don't really have much time to spare on sex. If anything, there is a lot of nudity and implied sex.<br /><br />Also, it's called \\"Game of Thrones,\\" suggesting it's political intrigue. There are a lot of characters and a lot of titles--and they all have their own in-depth storylines. It makes it hard to keep track, but if you like political intrigue, this is perfect. After the first episode or two, you'll get to know the characters and get into the story far better.<br /><br />There is blood and violance, but it's set in a medieval setting in which violence was an everyday occurance. It only adds to atmosphere.<br /><br />All in all, I liked how each of the characters are portrayed. I thought the casting was spot-on. The actors and actresses seemed to bring them to life. The music was decent, though it's not great. The scenery is amazing. The dialogue comes straight out of the books in a lot of cases. This, to me, makes for a perfect adaption of Martin's books. Highly recommended for fans of the medieval genre or for those who like political intrigue.
B004XIQDYW|5.0|the title, says good part of what i will mean by writing this message, It`s more than a nice record to add to your collection, its indeed epic. Its artsy and enjoyable that relatively new indie rock bands keep making vinyl records. I just love the sound, I would love it anyway..This was a good purchase, and I assure you if you have where to play it, you`ll sure at least cry once..:D<br />-A pleased being..
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|The decline is complete.  It began in earnest with the Seeger Sessions and has continued apace.  This cd is almost a parody of a Springsteen effort.  Sorry to say it, but the Boss has no cloths.  The drum loops, gospel choir, hand clapping and hip-hop rants are so over-wrought.  He has become a prisoner of his own iconic image to the point where his reaching to make every song anthemic is distracting and ultimately defeating.  To test my reaction, I pulled out Darkness on the Edge of Town and gave a listen for a comparison. I invite you to do the same.  The restraint shown throughout the earlier release adds to the delivered anger that eventually emerges. It is a stunning musical statement.  By contrast, Wrecking Ball seems emotively false, hollow and forced.  I sadly suggest taking a \\"wrecking ball\\" to his output the last decade.

It still holds up well today.<br /><br />Sure the new release wasn't bad, but it doesn't hold a candle to this one.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer plays one nasty part, and plays it perfectly. Why ANYone would pick him up on the highway is anyone's guess. But as you no doubt are aware, that's exactly what happens.<br /><br />The movie starts out quickly and keeps on going.<br /><br />It's pacing reminded me of the old DUEL movie that starred Dennis Weaver as he was harassed down the highway by a truck driver.<br /><br />Definitely worth a re-watch. And if you've never seen it, definitely worth a first look.

B003Y5HWMW|3.0|The Blu-ray discs take about one minute to load after inserting them in my Toshiba BDX1200KU Blu-ray player.  During this time, nothing is displayed on screen and the Blu-ray player takes no input other than EJECT or STOP.  This made me think the discs would not play at all, and my Blu-ray player does not have any firmware upgrades, so that was a discouraging experience.  I was lucky to have just left the discs in for a while, trying to press any button other than EJECT or STOP, when I discovered that waiting a full minute was all I needed to do to get the discs to play.  This is a significant inconvenience, but I am happy I can view the content now, at least.  I give this Blu-ray set 3 out of 5 for the inconvenience and initial frustration.<br /><br />Supplemental info: They will not play at all in my computer's Blu-ray drive, an LG BH10LS30, even after the latest manufacturer firmware update.

B003L77G2Y|3.0|Being of the age of the X-files when I found Fringe I was totally hooked. Living in the remote Alaskan wilderness and not having a TV and only a DVD player I had to wait a long time for the Third season. The shows quality is equal to season one and two but I disliked them carrying the one theme for the entire season. Having (almost) the entire season deal with Olivia and her 'other universe' Olivia got a bit tiring. However it is part of the puzzle of Fringe and had to be explained and I am happy that I now have it.
B007IQX1G4|2.0|Everything is perfect about this movie but I couldn't like it.  The characters are sharp and realistic, every detail is taken care of, the story flows, and it's a harsh comedy on those stuck in the past.  This movie's flaw is that watching it was like hanging out with any of several people that I used to know and don't like much.  I got some laughs but I rather would have been doing something else.

B00004BZ16|4.0|I still would rate \\"London Calling\\" as the best, and my favorite, Clash album, but I find that in recent years I'm playing \\"Sandinista\\" more often. It was definitely the  Clash's most ambitious undertaking and a very good album(s) in its own right: a three record set of new material that bewildered many listeners when it was first released, but that has aged well. I bought the vinyl package and played it death way back then, and have remained fond of it ever since. Yeah, there's some crap on here; a few too many boring dub versions and other audio experiments gone awry. But there are also many great songs on these two compact discs; some of the band's more interesting, captivating, and emotional tunes. Too many to list; pick your own gems. I wouldn't recommend this as the best introduction to the Clash, but if you have an open ear, and have heard other albums by the band, by all means get this CD and enjoy discovering some unforgettable music.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Musically, this is an amazing set of songs. There is a lot of complexity and depth to them, and they cover a wide range of prog-ish styles. I can't find a flaw, and production values on the 2 CD set are high. \\"Sectarian\\" is a stand-out track, with a lot of kick, and musical complexities.<br /><br />But something that I'm not seeing mentioned in these reviews are the lyrics. Maybe a lot of the reviewers are prog rockers and have been trained by years of Yes and King Crimson to tune the lyrics out. That would be a mistake in this case, because the lyrics are integral to the music. They are also very, very dark at a couple of points, and that's something that I think a buyer should be aware of before buying. All the songs with lyrics are about failed relationships, sometimes very failed. Some are merely sad (Like Dust), some are creepy (Postcard, Index), and at least one qualifies as openly sociopathic (Raider II). I'm not saying that makes them bad songs - given the overall theme, they are very well done. But what drove me to write this review was the guy saying that Raider II was a favorite of his children. I'd recommend websearching the lyrics to these songs, especially that one, before playing it for the kids. They are stark on a page, and a great deal starker in the context of the vocal delivery and the music.<br /><br />That said, these are fascinating songs and very well wrought. They hold up well to repeated play. There are lots of homages to other musician's styles woven in, and bunches of original ideas. Just be aware that, lyrically, this is no Jon Anderson.
B000001GPW|5.0|Ever since their release in the early 1960s (recordings made in September 1959 for PC 2 & 3 and October 1960 for No. 1) these versions have been hailed as classics, recordings of reference. It is easy to understand why, and the unanimous accolades can be endorsed, even half a century later (can it be that much?!) when so much water has flown under the Bartok bridges.<br /><br />First, the sonics. The are a major improvement over anything that had been published earlier, and still hold up well today, offering more than many more recent versions. Just a year before, Vox had released the first stereo recording of all three concertos, by Gyorgy Sandor, and they were already a huge improvement over all the versions published in the mono era, affording great presence to the piano and revealing for the first time a quantity of felicitous orchestral details (see my review of [[ASIN:B000001KC2 Gyorgy Sandor Plays Bart&oacute;k]]). But Vox' assignment of the piano to one channel and orchestra to the other was somewhat naïve and sometimes jarring, and worse still, judging from the original reviews in The Gramophone and their reviling the over-reverberant acoustics, muddy sound, mush and clotted texture, Vox's (and later, Turnabout's) subpar transfers and LP pressings badly betrayed the original recording. Anyway, any such problems have been taken care of by the revelatory 1992 transfers of Vox Legends. Still, even compared to those, DG's recording goes one step further, with a piano even more impressively present and potent than Sandor's (and less clangy) and a spacious and all-environning orchestra. And the new remastering for this \\"Originals\\" reissue offers itself a minor improvement over the first CD reissue on \\"Dokumente\\" from 1988, [[ASIN:B00000E4E1 B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k: 3 Piano Concertos / Rhapsodie for Piano & Orchestra / Concerto for Orchestra - G&eacute;za Anda / Radio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin / Ferenc Fricsay]] (which was already very satisfactory). One reviewer's comment that \\"the recorded sound is limited\\" doesn't need to be believed: what is limited was obviously his hearing on the day he listened - not to exclude the possibility that, like Moses, Muhammad and Joan of Arc, some people hear things that the rest of the world doesn't hear, but it doesn't make their comments about sonics more helpful to the rest of us worldly mortals with normal hearing. The recorded sound is great.<br /><br />And the orchestra. Fricsay had been music director of the RIAS-Orchestra of Berlin (that was the Radio Orchestra of the American sector) from 1948 to 1954 and again (the orchestra being now called the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Berlin) from 1959 to his death, but even in the meanwhile he had kept close ties with the orchestra through numerous guest concerts, tours and recordings. By the late 1950s Fricsay had obviously honed it to a fine standard, and other than at the (rhythmically tricky) recapitulation in the first movement of PC 1 (6:23), where it sounds tentative and messy, it is entirely on top of Bartok's biting orchestration. Some reviewers have also taken the orchestra to task, calling it \\"weak\\" or contending that it \\"doesn't play to the highest standards\\". Such comments would have to be a little more specific to be given any serious consideration. Examples and demonstrations please? The orchestra plays to the highest standards.<br /><br />And then, the interpretations. I've called Sandor's Bartok (with two different orchestras and conductors, Rolf Reinhardt and the Baden-Baden Radio Orchestra in No. 1, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under Michael Gielen in 2 & 3) \\"not Magyar for Western consumption: but Bartok's raw and crude power, Magyar remembering Attila the Hun\\". Anda and Fricsay's Bartok is more civilized and polished, the Huns assimilated by a few centuries Christianity. Not that Anda's piano lacks the required pounding power. On the contrary, thanks to the very close recording, it is impressively massive (I wonderwhere I got the notion of Anda as a \\"gentle\\" pianist): try for instance the first movement of PC No. 1 at 7:45, the explosions you hear are not produced by the gongs and tam-tam but by Anda's left hand, and it is awesome. Fricsay can also whip the orchestra to plenty of savagery and bite when he wishes, and nowhere more than in the finale of PC 1; the finale of PC 2 isn't wanting either, although subsequent versions have been even more urgent: Bishop Davis ([[ASIN:B00000E4A9 Bela Bartok Piano Concerti Nos 1 2 3 Stephen Bishop-Kovacevich (Philips)]]), Bronfman Salonen ([[ASIN:B000002AWA Bartok: The Three Piano Concertos]]) among them.<br /><br />But the orchestra doesn't have the crude colors and raw bite of Vox's pair either, the lower woodwinds and especially the bassoon do not jump out with so much pungency. It is deliberately that my comments here are poker-faced: many listeners are likely to find Vox's orchestras TOO crude and raw, and most have found Fricsay's just right - and it is. Yet I think there is something substantially Bartokian in the very crudeness of the Vox versions, but Fricsay's more polished approach is certainly easier to take - no wonder then that it received the accolades - and it is also a valid and revelatory approach in its own right, that makes up in subtlety, atmosphere, refinement and a sense of naturalness what it may loose in terms of drive (in the first movements of all three Concertos) and raw power.<br /><br />Significantly, tempos in those first movements are broader than Sandor's (except in the introduction of PC 1, uniquely deliberate with Sandor-Reinhardt). Compare, for instance, the 9:43 it takes Anda and Fricsay to get through the first movement of PC2, to Sandor's 8:48. Almost all subsequent versions are somewhere in between, Pollini-Abbado being at 9:34 one of the most spacious ([[ASIN:B000001G6E Bartok: Piano Concertos 1 & 2]]), and Richter with Maazel ([[ASIN:B000EMSIBM Tchaikovsky: Piano Concertos Nos. 1, 2 & 3 / Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 5 / Bartok: Piano Concerto No. 2]]) being the one subsequent exception in taking a uniquely deliberate approach (9:57): but Farnadi and Scherchen in the mono era (Westminster original, reissued by Tahra, [[ASIN:B0015DM4B4 Farnadi & Scherchen-Westminster-Archive Vol.4]]) had been even more extreme (10:31). The impression with Anda-Fricsay may be comparatively more leisurely and patrician perhaps, but never lacking in power (try the \\"mosso\\" sections at 2:15 and 2:57 for instance), and there is an unexpected and welcome element of playfulness that comes through in the dialogues with the saucy woodwinds, although DG's recording doesn't always let them come out with enough pungency. The reviewer who calls Fricsay \\"heavy-handed\\" is clearly a case where being stuck on one interpretation (here, Sandor's) clogs the ears with wrong expectations (see my comment under the review) and leads one to confuse the interpretation and the composition - the reason why I am an obsessive accumulator of many different versions.<br /><br />Take also, as another significant example, the \\"mosso\\" section in the first movement of PC 1, at 1:57: typically, Fricsay here hardly steps up his tempo at all, keeping a mood of leisurely and rustic bonhomie rather than, like Sandor-Reinhardt at 2:06, of urgent drive. The approach may lack here the ultimate degree of excitement, but it pays many dividends, especially as Anda is a more imaginative and subtle pianist than Sandor. For instance, the short cadenza at 3:26 in the first movement of PC 1, very square with Sandor, is enhanced by a whimsical staccato with Anda. But it is the moments of repose that make a big difference, like, typically, the sostenuto at 3:36 in that same movement, which Sandor kept martial and urgent with very little p dynamics, and which acquires with Anda the wonderfully dreamy and poetic character of Bartok's typical nocturnal movements. Anda and Fricsay's masterful shaping of tempo pays great dividendsalso in the big acceleration from 5:26 to 6:23 in the first movement, where they start slow and move up to dizzying speed; the same passage remained very square with Sandor. Throughout Anda's phrasings and tempos ooze a feeling of evidence and naturalness.<br /><br />The middle movement of PC 1 has great atmosphere, although - again, typically - it doesn't quite rise to the massive pounding power of Sandor; but Anda is better at making the piano a percussion instrument among others (as was evidently Bartok's intention), rather than, like Sandor, treating it in the spirit of the old concerto. Fricsay takes the slow movement of PC2 at a more flowing tempo than anybody else, before or after (Abbado with Pollini comes close) - but still, at circa 60 quarter-notes/mn, significantly slower than Bartok's metronome indication of 66-69. I think here Fricsay has captured another essential Bartok value: the adagios should be atmospheric but never sentimental, and they never need to be milked. And atmospheric it is: the strings (and caressing timpani) convey a wonderfully hushed atmosphere and the piano a fine sense of mystery and expectation. In the fast middle section Anda's fleetness and lightness of touch, together with the saucy bite of Fricsay's winds, are perfect. The same comments apply to the \\"Adagio religioso\\" of PC 3 (title not Bartok's, but given by editor Tibor Serly), with a beautifully soft, tender and pensive piano of Anda, and a middle section that takes its time, going less for contrast than for another shading of the same atmosphere.<br /><br />PC 3 is a fascinating case where, even more than in the two others, Fricsay and Anda's recording established a whole new interpretive paradigm. We are today so accustomed to Bartok's third being one of his most gentle and lyrical works - something like Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto among his own output - that we neglect that this character is not so much in the nature and fabric of the composition, as a matter of interpretation (and the same is actually true with Beethoven's 4th). Take just about all the early recordings, Sandor-Ormandy's premiere in 1946 recorded only two months after their world premiere given in Philadelphia, Kentner-Boult's live concert of the European premiere that same year, Kentner again with Fricsay in concert in 1950, the studio recordings made in 1953 and 1954 by Pennario-Golschmann, Katchen-Ansermet and Haas-Fricsay (all product links in the comments section): they were all, in the first movement, urgent and biting, an approach that fit much more the general view of Bartok - and the most extreme in that direction had been Sandor in his stereo remake with Gielen. The only exceptions had been Farnadi-Scherchen in 1953, uniquely spacious as in their 2nd, Annie Fischer with Markevitch in 1955 (but with an urgent and biting finale), and Lipatti with Sacher in concert in 1948 (but that version was made public only in 1999, see my review for the details).<br /><br />Despite these predecessors, Anda and Fricsay were those who really established the new lyrical paradigm. The timings in the first movement are telling: 7:07, compared to Sandor-Ormandy's 6:19, Haas-Fricsay's 6:28, Sandor-Gielen's extreme 5:47. Farnadi-Scherchen took it in 7:33, and Lipatti-Sacher in their own extreme 7:45, a spaciousness emulated only by Barenboim-Boulez in 1967 (7:43). But a new trend was set, and I know no version that took it in less than 7 after Anda-Fricsay. The stylistic evolution of Katchen is here significant: 6:35 with Ansermet in 1953, 7:11 with Kertesz in 1965.<br /><br />What that more leisurely approach to tempo allows is for greater lyricism and delicacy in the statement of the theme, less \\"tightness\\" and breathless urgency. But it doesn't preclude the necessary bite and muscularity when the music calls for it, as soon as 1:04 here. In fact, I find that Anda-Fricsay have captured the ideal blend of the lyrical and the muscular. Likewise their finale here strikes anideal middle-ground between the urgent and breathless approach of Pennario or those, still urgent but not as breathless, of Annie Fischer with Markevitch and Sandor with Gielen (or, in the modern times, Bishop-Davis and Ashkenazy-Solti) on the one hand, and the leisurely one of Katchen with Ansermet, Farnadi with Scherchen or Ogdon-Sargent. Incidentally, Anda-Fricsay are here strikingly similar to Haas-Fricsay.<br /><br />There is no such thing as \\"the best\\" recording, because the many possibilities of a score cannot be encompassed by only one version, and ideally any collection would need at least three versions of any composition, the two extremes and the middle ground. Still, anybody can live happily with Anda-Fricsay even as their only version of Bartok's three Piano Concertos. The sonics are still great and the interpretations deserve their status of classics. This reissue on The Originals, with its slightly improved sonics over the previous reissue on Dokumente, entailed the loss of Fricsay's Concerto for Orchestra (but it can be found on another Originals reissue, [[ASIN:B000001GQV Bart&oacute;k: Concerto for Orchestra Sz 116 / Musik fur Saiteninstrumente, Schlagzeug und Celesta Sz 106]]) and of Bartok's youthful and derivatively Lisztian Rhapsody op. 1.

B0064J6OMO|1.0|The movie would have been really funny if it wasn't so raunchy.  The profanity and nude scenes were not needed. The screenwriter and director should tell a funny story plain and simple.
0312962118|5.0|I don't often write Amazon reviews but a friend lent me an old copy of this and I thought it was bloody brilliant! Just one question - why is it out of print?<br /><br />The plot is basically the same as Day of The Jackal, expect with Stalin as the target instead of De Gaulle, and is a chase through 1950's Soviet Union from the Baltic to Moscow with Slanski as a deadly assassin and Lukin his KGB nemesis.<br /><br />The first 100 pages are the slowest, setting up the backstory including cameos from Eisenhower and a chocolate-munching-torture-porn watching Stalin, but as soon as operation Snow Wolf begins and the team are dropped into the USSR the action is relentless right to end. Believe me, you will have some very late nights with this book!<br /><br />If it was just a chase through Russia it would still be brilliant- but what makes it so special is that it has a soul. Real emotional heart. The characters are life-like and I really cared about them, especially Slanski and Anna. It's also a very emotional book. I have to admit I was pretty choked by the ending.<br /><br />There are also some totally unexpected twists. One in particular towards the end I never saw coming and is a complete game-changer! From that point on I read till the last page, finally finished the book at 1:50am even though I had an early start the next morning. And even when it's over, there is a final revelation in the author's note. Apparently this could all be based on real events.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. It's genuinely unputdownable. It's such a shame it's out of print. Given how many rubbishy thrillers there are out there this seems a tragedy. I hope someone sorts it out soon. This is a book that deserves to be back in the bestseller charts.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|After the disaster that was the Star Wars Prequels I couldn't face having another fond memory of my teenage years ruined so have avoided seeing this till now. As it turns out it wasn't half as bad as I expected. Either that or hearing other people talk about it I just had low expectations.<br /><br />In many ways it's classic Indy - with plenty of action, fights, chases, big stunts and mythological artefacts. In fact that might be its biggest problem. Not only have they done nothing new with the formula (apart from shifting the action to the 50s which just doesn't feel right for an Indiana Jones movie), by keeping so close to the original films you can't help but compare them.<br /><br />Although Harrison Ford is still game, I thought he looked a bit tired in the part. Often he seems to be doing a parody of his most famous character. The tone is too jokey (remember the seriousness of Raiders? Or sheer darkness of Temple of Doom?). That was always a problem with the latter films but here I think they've taken it too far. In places it's more like a slapstick comedy. The supernatural side has been taken too far too. It was subtle and scary in the first film. Here it's a bit dumb. In fact throughout it's more fantasy than reality. There are some nice `Spielbergian' touches though - the lights/coins following the magnet field in the opening, the glimpse of the ark of the covenant.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy it but turned off the DVD player thinking that the world wouldn't have been any better or worse if they hadn't made it. Personally I think they should have just left it at a trilogy. I hear they're thinking of making Indy 5. Four is more than enough!<br /><br />Oh, one final point: as someone who's travelled in Peru - the Nazca lines are NOT in Cusco!!!

B0002Y69NG|5.0|Its been a while, but i just rediscovered this great collection. Classic never goes out of style! I recently upgraded this set to the Blu Ray Boxed Set and in comparing these i realized that the DVD editions still looked great and crisp. Of course the Blu Ray transfer was pretty great, but the quality of picture on the DVD set was great. There is no direct difference between the 2, in fact the booklet in the DVD editions is better. The Discs look the same, and having the Animatrix included in the collection was just an added bonus. All in all, this is a great set to own, Blu Ray or DVD. The broadest difference on the Blu Ray is the Dolby True HD soundtrack.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have seen 'Twilight' at least 23 tmes, and I think the same goes for 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse'.  I also bought and read all of the books, including 'Breaking Dawn'.  I received this DVD several weeks ago and I still have not watched it.  The reason for my procrastination is that I do not want to see this event end, and I know that after 'Breaking Dawn part II', it's could be the end of the story.  I have been caught up by the 'Twilight' saga, for real, just as I was with the series 'Moonlight'. I wish the Cullen family existed as vampires, so they could stay young forever and continue to offer a temporary escape into that  exciteing, alternate reality.  I will watch it this weekend, and I already know I will enjoy it, having read the book and because I have become a close friend of the Cullens and the Quillayutes.  You already know how popular these movies are.  That many people can't be mistaken.  You will enjoy them to the fullest if you start at the beginning, with 'Twilight', then continue with 'New Moon', 'Eclipse' and then 'Breaking Dawn' parts 1 and 2.  Together they create a beautiful, exciteing love story that you will find hard to forget.

B0040QYROA|5.0|Unless the few snippets that are still missing can be found--and never say never--this is probably as \\"complete\\" a cut of this marvelous film as we are going to get.  Like many cut films, like \\"Lost Horizon\\", these  restored releases that bring back the lost scenes are proof how the Company Heads don't see things from the view-point of both the directors and the audience.<br />  Even as a cut film, \\"Metropolis\\" is a eye-catching opus that allows the viewer to enter a futuristic city built upon the toil of the workers, who live beneath the city, and the upper class (you can read that as the \\"one percent\\".) The two finally come together at the cost of the city's infrastructure and many lives.  And while the solution seems over-simplified and possibly to some too sentimental, the film's visual power overcomes these problems.<br />  In a way, this could be seen as the grandparent of films as \\"Blade Runner\\" and, of course, CPO in \\"Star Wars\\".  The sequence of city scapes--with elevated roads and airplanes flying through the city are marvelous to see.  If you view the film, notice the similarities of the LAPD building in \\"Blade Runner\\" and the New Tower of Babylon and the Mechanical Man to the androids of the George Lucas films.  The story-line is seen in too many stories and films to note.<br />  Finally, while some of the actors seem to express too much--something you have to accept when watching silent films--the acting of Alfred Abel is extraordinary--especially with his face communicating the emotions of control, sorrow, lust and fear.  This is silent acting at its best as his body/facial movements speak the meanings that his mouth never could.<br />  It should also be noted that this is a rather adult film with semi-nudity, bordellos, and other activities that are not for younger viewers.  I would also like to plug the German version of \\"Titanic\\" which was made under the Nazi government--a film so well made that snippets were borrowed for Britian's superior \\"A Nightto Remember\\"--if you can get by the propaganda, you will find an interesting film.

0439023483|5.0|It's not often that a writer of fiction can so accurately measure the pulse of the human condition. Suzanne Collins has brilliantly done just that in  \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br />What is it about the human condition that draws us to live vicariously through the exploits of others? To live as spectators instead of participants? Why do we shrink into the shadows, afraid of standing out yet celebrate and at the same time despise those who do stand out - who take the hero's journey? Do we recognize our own fear; our own hypocrisy? We find ourselves wanting; hungry for fulfillment. Not just of the belly but more of the spirit and the soul.<br />Some who suffer discover that alongside depravity and ignorance lies beauty and light. With this discovery is the yearning to be free - not so much from our outer circumstances but more from our inner prison. The hero's journey is the discovery of what it means to be real.<br />The soulless ones (as represented by those in The Capital) hunger the most for fulfillment and meaning. Their answer is to set themselves up as gods; separate and special from the rest. Lacking an internal compass, they seek to manipulate and control others. Their illusion of power and control mask their fear of those who are truly free. Theirs is an artificial existence covered over with makeup and trendy styles. Their precarious position depends on others living in fear. So they erect their electrified fences, track our movements with their cameras and monitor our conversations. They sacrifice our children to their wars and employ enforcers to keep the mob under control. Still, some do break the rules and escape into the wilderness and discover there is a different reality. There are times, in order to be true to one's self, we must take a stand. We break through the artificial restraints and discover there are things worth living for. ...and dying for. Until we find fulfillment we hunger. We play games.<br />Read the book. You will not be disappointed. You will hunger for more.will hunger for more.

AND (but wait .. you also get  ;-) it is very easy for my wife to then pickup the tablet, enter the unlock code, and quickly use the tablet as she wants to use it.  Very well done.<br /><br />We like to monitor our kid's time and activity anyhow when they use their tablet but this does make our lives just a little easier.  Means they can look up things in Wikipedia or Farlex Dictionary or play a game like Osmos and we can spend less time worrying about what else they can get into.  Thank you Kids Place for making a positive difference.

B0072X2O66|5.0|For years, bands like Dream Theater have gotten poor reviews from rock fan saying \\"it's too complicated\\", \\"there's too many notes\\", \\"not enough feeling\\".  Now, Adrenaline Mob, a ROCK band is getting poor reviews from prog fans for being too \\"simple\\" and \\"dumb\\".  As an avid fan of both, I have to say this album is incredible.  If you're not a fan of bands like Stone Sour, Disturbed, Black Label Society, etc, you problably won't enjoy it.  If you are, this should be a treat for you.<br />When blasted at full volume, these songs really kick some arse.  Russell Allen, as always, is a beast on vocals.  The more recent 'growl' in his voice fits this much better than the last couple of Symphony X albums, and he still belts out the high notes when he needs to.  Mike Orlando has such a weird palm muted, stiff-armed style of shredding that even when you get used to it by the end of the album, it still sounds nasty.  Mike Portnoy, known for his avid overplaying, really plays each note to perfection on this album.  Each drum fill fits the moment or guitar lick perfectly and there's the occasional moment of time-feel shifting (yes, it stays in 4/4).  Overall, all three guys keep up the energy throughout the album and make some songs that should be played on the radio (oh no, god forbid!). The mix is phenomenal and really lets them shine.<br />I will admit there's the occasional moment of cheese in the lyrics, but my overall rating of 4.5 rounds up to 5.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're simply a prog nerd and want odd signatures, movements and epics, this isn't for you.  If you want some rock music to blast, GET IT!

B005EHNEDO|4.0|Wilco's album's since the so-called 'experimental' albums Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002) and a ghost is born (2004) were not bad, but Sky Blue Sky (2007) and Wilco (The Album) (2009) were in retrospect, as much as I liked those albums when they first came out, too comfortable and lacking in urge. As a result, I really don't listen to those albums much anymore. I wondered what would be next for Wilco. That has now been answered, and how!<br /><br />\\"The Whole Love\\" (12 tracks; 56 min.) finally corrects that, and this album reminds me again of the urge so clearly displayed on YHF. Check out the opening track, the 7 min. epic \\"Art of Almost\\" (the best track on here), which is (metaphorically) the long-lost cousin of \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\". Just as you think the song is about to end, comes a shattering 2 1/2 min. musical outro, just fabulous. The album is worth buying for just that song. It is followed by \\"I Might\\", seemingly the long-lost cousin of YHF's \\"War on War\\". The album is front-loaded with great songs, check out the hard-charging \\"Downed On Me\\" and the acoustic \\"Blackmoon\\" as other hightlights. I rate the album's first half a perfect 5 stars. The second half kicks off with a strong \\"Open Mind\\", with some ear-splitting electric guitar licks. \\"Standing O\\" is another hard-charging tune, reminding me of early Elvis Costello of all things. It all leads up to the last track, the 12 min. sprawling \\"One Sunday Morning (Song for Jane Smiley's Boyfriend\\", a gently rolling song that goes on, and on, and on. Really don't know what to make of that song to be honest. A strange way to end what otherwise is a pretty darn impressive album.<br /><br />In all, \\"The Whole Love\\" is clearly Wilco's best album since \\"a ghost is born\\", and a welcome return to the more daring, exploring ways of Wilco. I have seen Wilco in concert many, many times in the last 10+ years, and in my book they are one of the best American live bands out there (MMJ also comes to mind). Haven't seen them live yet in support of this album, but I'm hopeful that I will get a chance to correct that over the summer months to come. Meanwhile \\"The Whole Love\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!them live yet in support of this album, but I'm hopeful that I will get a chance to correct that over the summer months to come. Meanwhile \\"The Whole Love\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B004T5R2HQ|3.0|I used to use this program on my previous Shift and it was fabulous! Now installed on my new phone, which is another HTC Evo Shift, it takes the scan and turns it into junk every time.  Just a page of stripes.  Tried reinstall.<br /><br />Update. On advice of other reviewers (here) I uninstalled the Amazon market version and installed one from Android market. That seemed to work!
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|I bought this 4-disc edition to be the first movie in my 3D set. With my 3 kids, from 12 to 4 years old, we put on our 3d lens and enjoy. The movie looks great, but it was drawn in 2D with parallel planes so when it was transformed to 3D you can see some characters and part of the landscape in 3D but the rest remain in 2D. At some parts looks weird, but it doesn't matter to my childrens. The Lion King was one of the first movies for my older son, he watched it so many times that he was able to remember every detail on songs and parlaments. For him it was like to see again an old friend and was the happiest with the movie, but all spent a great time watching it.<br />Worth to buy the 3D set on BD, and also the DVD copy for the less careful kids. Digital copy requires to connect on Itunes, but was OK to me.<br />We expect the next parts of the movie on 3D!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Keeps me entertained for hours on end! Although it did used to be free. but nonetheless I'd totally buy its so worth the money
0756405890|5.0|This is a must have for any fantasy fan! Characters are very easy to relate with, and the detail in the story is fantastic, absolutely no complaints with the text. The European cover art is much much better and way more appealing, the U.S. one is just rushed and probably is hurting sales due to how generic it looks....<br />Buy this book!
0440244870|1.0|This is one of the top 2 worst books I have ever read (out of literally thousands).  Stupid, silly, and filled with unpleasant characters.<br /><br />The fact that it is so successful and has spawned a whole series makes me fear for mankind.
0756407125|3.0|I would have preferred to give this a 3.5 but was not an option. The Name of the Wind was so refreshing and such a great book, but this one just fell short, there was too much filler and not enough adding to the main story, i would have preferred he cut a few pages and made it shorter than just fill. Too much time was spend on a subject not that intriguing while hardly any was spent on what we wanted to know more about! I will most certainly buy book three but i hope it is more like book one than book 2.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|horribly boring.  Do not watch this movie.  Total waste of time.  I felt cheated of time I could have been doing something better.  The previews make it look all action packed but it wasn't.
0439023521|3.0|A pretty good read with some good plot twists sprinkled here are there. The premise is very engaging and for the most part, things play out to a satisfying end. That being said, there are quite a few moments where some of the characters oscillate to the extreme ends on the spectrum of brilliant to inbred, or characters will say and do things that seem almost unforgivably out of character. The very ending of the book, which I found to be the principal example of this (based on how the main character had acted earlier, there's no way around that). The main character of the novel has the majority of these moments, but then, she's the one in the spotlight much more heavily anyhow. But all of the characters feel real 95% of the time, which constitutes the vast majority of the book.<br /><br />***Spoilers below***<br /><br />Things that I really liked about the book<br /><br />- Great plot, very intriguing. From what I've seen, it IS original, or as original as anything can be anymore, given the amount of literature out there, you're not going to have a book that doesn't have SOME aspect of itself similar to something else. The plot was really what made this a page turner for me, I ended up just wanted to see who would make it out alive. Some of the characters annoyed the living **** out of me from time to time, but the plot was very good throughout<br />- The good plot twists that happen (some feel forced or can be seen coming a mile away). The wolf mutations towards the end was definitely the best twist of the book in my opinion<br />- The premise is very bleak, not sugarcoated in hardly any way, and the book is not afraid to go to some very dark and macabre places. Well done<br /><br />Specific examples of things that drove me insane<br /><br />- Katniss ruining the end of the book by, after trying to save Peeta's life on several occasions, after trying to save him from the doctors who she thought would kill him (not out of survival at this point, merely because she truly cares deeply about him), and going through hell and back with him (intense hardship brings people together much faster, simple fact of life), Katniss ends up saying \\"Oh...Gale...who I haven't thought of for 100 pages...I still might/possibly/kinda/I don't know/maybe love you instead.\\" I shouldn't have finished reading the last chapter<br />- Thresh just inadvertently dies. Though they watch the replay of the entire hunger games, you never know what happened to Thresh. Cato just smothered him with a pillow or called him ugly until he died, which Thresh was defenseless against. You can't make a character that has such an integral role 5 pages earlier just vanish into thin air<br />- This is a minor gripe, but I almost wished the book would've given you more info on the tributes before the competition starts. I find it a bit strange that Haymitch wouldn't go in depth on who the tributes are, what their apparent strengths are, and strategies for dealing with them. A lot of the tributes are just \\"that dude from district 10\\". Then they die 10 seconds later. Them dying doesn't really have any impact on the reader because they are just faceless numbers. I agree that you can't go in depth on them to a very large degree, because they're just passing by, but I think there should've been a bit more substance there<br />- The part at the end of the actual arena games I thought was... a bit forced as well. I thought it would've been a much more poetic ending if they actually HAD taken the berries. Since the hunger games are first and foremost scare tactics on the districts, I find it hard to believe that the capital would give two ****s about letting another two tributes die instead of letting go of their pride and unwavering dominion. Then again, this is YA, so that would've been a bit harsh, but this book goes to a lot of very dark places anyhow. I understand the reasoning that was put into the book about why they ended the games with two champions, I just think that it feels forced and not real. It's close, but it just doesn't seem right with all of the horrible things that the capital does. Even if the games ended with no champions, it wouldn't have really done anything bad for the capital, the games would've still had an epic ending and one that people would talk about for a long time. But then there wouldn't be a trilogy
B006MQRLSA|5.0|good movie, I'm not a baseball fan but this movie was entertaining and interesting. Brad Pitt is cool as ever and no way you can't love jonah hill.  Check it out for sure

B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fun, but sometimes the controls stick, and I still don't know where to find instructions. But is an interesting concept, a cute challenge,and a good time waster/distraction.
0439023521|3.0|I will keep this brief and spoiler free. I've only read the first book. It's an interesting concept and an entertaining, fast-paced read. As an adult, I did find it thought provoking at times, and it was definitely capable of evoking an emotional response.<br /><br />However, I don't think these books should be marketed towards children. I have much younger siblings, and I can tell you for a fact that these books are spreading like wildfire among 9-12 year olds at their school. Personally, I think they're completely inappropriate for children of that age, and I would be very upset if my 7th grader was required to read these books by their teacher. If you are a parent, I would urge you to read all of the books in this trilogy and carefully consider whether your children are ready for the dark, adult themes and explicit violence before allowing them to read these books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow. I found this by accident on Amazon--it just popped up in my recommendations. I clicked on it just to see what it might be like, and found a book with a staggering number of 5-star reviews. Could it be that good, or did the author just have that many friends? I had to find out.<br /><br />Set in a post-apocalyptic future, Wool tells the story of survivors with dreams. There's no scavenging in the ruins here--they have everything they need. Or do they? Some say they do. Others wholeheartedly disagree, and that's where the story starts.<br /><br />I've been somewhat disappointed with a lot of the indie books I've purchased for the Kindle. Not just spelling mistakes and stuff--that sort of thing happens to most of us. I just got tired of reading about cardboard characters in stories that didn't go anywhere.<br /><br />Let me just say that is NOT the case here. I'd never heard of Hugh Howey until a few days ago, and now I'm wondering why in the heck not. Wool totally captivated me. I've been wandering around with my Kindle stuck to my face for the last couple of days. It wasn't just the story; Howey writes beautifully, never overexplaining. The world is rich and true, but not overcomplicated. I was impressed, but beyond that, just grateful to sink into the story. I'm sort of old, and I've read a lot of books. That gratitude doesn't show up very often.<br /><br />I wouldn't call Wool a YA novel, but it's not particularly violent. I'd recommend it for anyone middle-school or older who's looking for a story of hope. Spend the ridiculously low price and get the omnibus edition. You won't be sorry!
B000BZ9DKW|1.0|I ordered the Office Space Special Edition DVD Gift set: Includes the Special Edition DVD, Red Stapler, Lumbergh Coffee Mug, Mouse Pad, Magnetic Picture Frame, Pen & Pencil Set, and TPS Report Notepad.I received only the DVD!!! Now I have to request a refund from Amazon, and ship this back and wait up to 10-15 days for a refund! JOKE!!! Amazon did not even attempt to contact the seller to see if the Gift Set was accidentally not included in the shipping.  And as for \\"Amazon\\" filling the order, what kind of IDIOT would fill an order which says \\"DVD GIFT SET\\" and only put a DVD in the box which was $48.68. Ridiculous! NOT HAPPY WITH SELLER AND NOT HAPPY WITH AMAZON!!!!
1612130283|1.0|Following the grand tradition of goatse and Rick Astley, we now have another name to add to the annals of epic trolling: E.L. James. It takes a lot of guts to write a \\"Twilight\\" fanfic, do a quick find/replace on the names and actually publish it as an original work of fiction -- and one that is ostensibly THE HOTTEST THING a bunch of housewives interviewed on the \\"Today\\" show have ever read! I read about a third of it and skimmed the rest, and every \\"erotic\\" scene was laughable. There's so much biting of lips, creepy long fingers and \\"golly gee willikers, oh my, jeez, jeepers, holy cow\\" wide-eyed innocence, you'll want to throw the book across the room. Repetitive, and quite frankly, boring. However, mad props to E.L. James, who is laughing all the way to the bank. Maybe I'll join her by writing a \\"Fifty Shades\\" fanfic, changing the names and charging obscene amounts of money to read it -- which would probably open up a loop of epic trolldom that would throw us all into an extinction-level event and tick the clock one minute closer to doomsday.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|The B-Ray disc is in excellent shape and played like brand new. The plastic case was cracked, but the movie was my main concern. This is one of the best movies I have watched. Your emotions during and after the movie are touched at all levels. A truly blessed movie by the Lord. I really enjoyed it immensely!! If I could give 10 stars I would!
B004D7GU3M|5.0|I love the album and It comes beautifully! I didnt open it because i bought it as a collection. It's an awesome buy and im glad i bought it.
034552554X|3.0|This book starts out intriguing, but the pace isn't maintained very well.  It becomes unrealistic pretty quickly and then just sort of sinks into a typical romance novel.  Too bad, a interesting start.
1400069289|5.0|This is by far the best book I've read this year. As a result of reading about the latest research about the brain in this book, I have picked up other books on the subject that have been released within the last year. None comes even close in showcasing our ability to exert more control over the behaviors that shape our day-to-day life. Of particular interest to me was the concept of keystone habits. I have always had a way of identifying them, but never had I, or anybody else for that matter, described them in such a concise and effective way.<br />Thanks to this book people now have the ability to untangle themselves from the strings that make us feel like puppets of our habits.
B000Q7ZND6|3.0|this BR disc does not have menu, the quality it's as good as DVD so there no big difference, but still been a really good movie

0062082353|1.0|Felt like it was written by a high-school drop out. Incredibly boring. Author gives egotistical account of how great he was, as if he were the only one in the war. If you want to read a great book about snipers read Marine Sniper by Charles Henderson.

It is heartwarming - especially if you love dogs!!!!!!!
B006PHD0RW|3.0|graphics are fine, concept was intriguing, various combos a nice twist. However, what really annoys me &amp; was frustrating is that logic doesn't seem to apply. I am probably being over critical but it was annoying when a row of cereal &amp; milk wouldn't support eggs &amp; chips &amp; bread. It's basically Tetris with food but doesn't follow basic logic....the levels make it addictive but it quickly became frustrating &amp; boring when items that should support other items (i guess one could say, in the real world) didn't....based on other reviews I am in the minority. But I'd rather play Where's my water

B006WWTKQ0|5.0|There is one reason and one reason only for all the negative reviews, right wing trolls. For all I know it's just one guy who has spent several days doing this. If you click on \\"my other reviews\\" next to the negative reviews, almost all of them have never reviewed anything else. That is because that account was created for the SOLE reason of marking down Happy Feet Two. Why? Because of a very vague environmental message you really have to search for to even see. They're doing the same thing to The Lorax right now and that type of behavior is really dispicable.<br /><br />Rest assured, Happy Feet Two is a great kid's movie. It's at least as good as the first one with Matt Damon and Brad Pitt adding a whole new dimension to the story and causing me to laugh out loud several times. The CGI is beautiful, the characters are fun and there's just as much singing and dancing as the first film. the 3D is also fantastic if you get that version.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|originally the ad supported version did these inline ads that weren't too big and were often interesting. recently started doing fullscreen ads, I am uninstalling it. too many devices to buy it on all of them and I'm not doing fullscreen ads. :)
B006WWTKQ0|5.0|These teabagger freaks are completely bizarre. They come on here in hordes with a hundred or more fake names just so they can mark this film down so it has a bad rating. Why? Because it has a vaguely environmental message. They're doing the same thing to The Lorax. Hey Teabaggers, cheating is what people do when the truth is against them!<br /><br />Here's the truth, Happy Feet Two is a delightful film for the whole family. Several song and dance sequences are either fun or moving. Robin Williams and particularly Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, are HILARIOUS! I laughed out loud sefveral times.<br /><br />This film is sweet, fun and very entertaining. In fact it's WAY better than the somewhat generic original. The CGI is really stunning throughout, and of higher quality than the first film. The 3D is also used to very good effect and when the snow starts to spray you really feel involved in the action.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself a young adult, which was the demographic intended for this trilogy, but I found it very entertaining, a quick and exciting read and would recommend it to a broader group.  Collins is very skilled in quickly bringing all of her characters to life.  The immediate identification with the characters and the constant action makes putting the book down a very difficult task.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|First time I read this type of Romance/BDSM (had too look up the acronym) :) I really loved this story.<br />I saw this book being discuss in MSNBC, I just had to get it... This story keeps you glued to the pages, I could not help but stay up all night reading it... it reminded me of the 'Twilight' novels just in XXX. I could not put the book down which is a bit disturbing to me....<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is a great love story of Anastasia and Mr. Christian Grey in so many levels. He is controlling freak and a bit of a stalker, but you get so overwhelming engage in his character that his presence in Ana life feels so welcoming. She unconsciously and consciously wants him with her always (which is something one can relate to in a first 'crush' / first love, you want to breath this person at all times) Christian ... he leaves you wanting more... You love him and hate him at the same time. Anastasia ... well what can I tell you about her, you fall in love with her character and you want to live vicariously through her.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next 2 books.....
1609611543|5.0|So much information!  My chiropractor told me about this book, I had been whining to him about feeling bloated and sluggish all the time.  After reading it I decided I would go wheat free for a while.  Although the first week I lost 4 pounds that was not my motivator.  The book was full of information, probably more than I could readily understand.  But this I did get:  todays wheat is bad for you.  It was chalk full of studies, clinical tests, and scientific info to back up the claims stated in the book, but the impressive part is what happens when you ditch the wheat in your diet.  I think it is time to get off the wheat wagon and get back to some healthy foods.  For me, it is a bit of a challenge at first figuring out what has wheat (everything with a label) and what is wheat free (everything without a label), unless stated to the contrary. Not being a celiac I don't have to be extreme about it, but I am going as wheat free as I can.  So nice not to have cravings for food and sugar all the time!  And about the weight loss...I haven't lost much in the 6 weeks I have been wheat free, but I sure feel better.  And I like that.

1577314808|3.0|The Good: His contribution to living in the \\"Now\\" is great. He is spot-on about training your mind to control your thoughts and the supposition that your mind is NOT you - I love that, so profound and yet so few people talk about it..<br /><br />The Bad: His philosophical meanderings. His flawed interpretation of religious texts. The \\"Now\\" can't solve all your problems, but Tolle tries his best to convince you so!<br /><br />While I appreciate the contribution Tolle has made to the public at large with this book (particularly given its publicity), I have a lot of issues with his philosophical arguments. He clearly has read some well-known religious texts and uses them to support his philosophy of the \\"Now\\" - I have no doubt he is a learned man. However, his religious attachment to the \\"Now\\" overwhelms his ability to interpret texts correctly - he is akin to (sorry to say) other overly-religious individuals whose blind attachments to ideas color their lenses to the extreme. Because I am less well-read in Eastern spiritual texts (I would say I am well-educated in the philosophies, just not an expert), I will reserve my comments to his biblical references..<br /><br />Without getting into too much detail or specific passages, Tolle makes the mistake of combining Christianity with other spiritual philosophies that adhere to Platonic beliefs. Contrary to what some branches of Christianity believe at present, Christianity is NOT Platonic - many Christian philosophers wrote on the subject for centuries after Christ's death (100 AD - 500 AD especially), particularly given the fact that many of them were Greek and Plato was himself Greek. They had to wrestle with their Greek philosophical heritage and their (relatively) new beliefs in Christ and a bodily resurrection (the Gnostics being one of the sects who did not believe in a bodily resurrection, and who were ultimately discredited -- they WERE Platonic).<br /><br />I don't fault Tolle for his misinformation - the same assumptions can be seen in countless modern & post-modern philosophical/self-help books - it's exceptionally prevalent. But there was only so much I could take - I ended up getting really annoyed with this book because, well, you can't have a conversation with a book, and I just started to see so many inaccuracies in his melange of Christian texts with Eastern/Platonic philosophies. His belief in the \\"Now\\" becomes a religion in and of itself - a blind adherence to a belief that overwhelms everything else. And he interprets everything through those \\"Now\\"-colored glasses..<br /><br />All in all, I think this book could have been written in 70-85 pages. And while I would consider the 70-85 pages a must-read, 70-85 pages does not a book make.. so Tolle finds a way to turn it into 200+<br /><br />I recommend a library copy or a used version..

1612130283|1.0|One word to describe this book: AWFUL.  That's the simple explaination.  I could go on and on about everything that is wrong with this book, but I will try to keep it high level.<br /><br />First, this is beyond terrible writing.  I think the author should stick with TV and stay away from the written word.  Because this is not even remotely literature.  I am not a writer but I have a degree in English Lit and I'm extremely well-read.  The writing here is practically Twighlight-level.  Additionaly, there are a few instances where punctuation mistakes occur.<br /><br />Second, this story is beyond terrible.  I am not talking about the porn.  I am not a prude (I'm a female in my early 30) so I can take this stuff...but only if it is written well and constitutes a decent story.  This story is completely under-developed with weak characters and repetitive plots.  I want to go back to my kindle and track how many times Ana referred to her \\"inner goddess.\\"  And I'm still not even sure what she means by it. I found her completely unrealistic and annoying. Completely naive and yet witty/sarcastic at the same time.  She didn't make sense as a character.<br /><br />Finally, I am angry as a reader and a former publishing employee (I worked for a major publishing house for several years, right out of college).  This book is complete trash - not because of the \\"porn\\" but because of the writing and the story.  It makes me angry that it's gone viral.  More so, it makes me angry that people are referring to this as a quality book.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Rented this movie simply because I thought there is no way that it is so bad it warranted over 200 one star reviews. I would watch it again. My husband and I both liked this movie (as far as little kid movies go), and all 3 of my kids loved this movie!<br />Mumble is grown up in this movie and now has a baby of his own.  Songs and dancing galore!  I plan on buying it now since my kids liked it. Still don't understand the hate against this movie,but whatever. Everyone has an opinion.

0307957934|2.0|An updated recycled read of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Frankenstein this time using the head of a Swiss hedge fund with an artificial intelligence computer he designed used to pick stock market funds and eventually think for itself. But this computer goes a bit too far. Uh-oh, there goes the Dow Jones, time for the 401K torch bearing villagers to kill the monster. Could have used some more character development. And why does it take a PhD in physics 15 chapters figure out who is doing the evil deeds when a reader with a G.E.D. got it in chapter two? If this is made into a movie, I'll crap my pants. Ending is so stupid.

B002IFT1ZA|4.0|HBO have made an art form of producing long, complex and brilliant television series packed full of gritty realism and adult content, eg. The Sopranos, Entourage, and of course The Wire. If you had to choose a fantasy series that would fit this mould, then George Martin's brutal epic 'A Song of Ice and Fire' would immediately spring to mind. It is as though he had written for this format from the beginning. 'A Game of Thrones' is essentially a hybrid of The Sopranos and Lord of the Rings, where feuding noble houses engage in intricate power games in a fantasy landscape which is threatened both by a relentless demonic winter and the return of the dragons.<br /><br />The best way to describe this series is to say that it is a remarkably faithful adaptation of the first novel. The writers adhere closely to Martin's story and characters, down to identical scenes and lines. The complexities of the plot are conveyed well, as is the 'tone' of the books. If you enjoy the books you will find much to enjoy here. The production values are excellent, with an attention to detail and effects that echoes Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films. The actors are mostly excellent, particularly Maisie Williams as Arya and the inspired choice of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion. Sean Bean simply is Eddard Stark, though it feels a bit like Boromir has somehow wandered into the HBO studio. As in the book, though, the sections set in Westeros are immeasurably better than the storyline of Danaerys and her travels in the East, which feel like a parody of an old sword and sandal flick.<br /><br />The Song of Ice and Fire books are chock full of sex and violence, so both make an appearance on screen here. The violence is done right, brutal and not hidden by cutaways. If someone cuts off a head or rips out a throat, we get to see it. One of the strengths of Martin's stories is that they do not romanticise violence. The sex in his books is also largely about the exercise of power and a comment on the difficulty of real relationships in this feudal society, not about giving the reader a thrill. HBO made the unfortunate choice of turning this into an excuse for titillation, with scenes that stick out as pandering in the way that they did in parts of The Wire. Though at least the word 'teats' seems to have gotten lost 'twixt book and screen.<br /><br />'A Game of Thrones' is the best book in the series, with a strong arc both for the overall plot and for individual characters. The following books have had a tendency to meander and to pile bleak and depressing events upon each other. I'm not sure they would translate as well to the screen. But we shall see.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With the book coming out and everyone talkign about this I had to read it.  Really enjoyed it looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|A movie like The Tourist is hard to be objective about when it comes with such star power, the critics widely trash it, and it goes from big screen to dvd within weeks. Even Ricky Gervais dog-piled not once, but twice to Johnny Depp's face during back to back Golden Globes ceremonies. I fully expected a total train wreck when I got around to watching it.<br /><br />It's not a train wreck but it's not very good. In going for the narrow lightweight espionage/romance/travelogue genre, The Tourist comes across as nothing more than a pale imitation. Jolie can pull of old time movie star appeal but her cheesy British accent offsets any credibility her glamour points get. Furthermore, she doesn't so much act as model clothes and jewelry. Depp doesn't even try for suave and goes straight for schleppy teacher clich&eacute;. I kept wishing he would visit a barber and transform, but he doesn't. In the milieu this movie strives to reproduce, even regular folk like Depp's character would be credited with a modicum of style and sophistication. In a movie that goes for style with substance, it was a poor omission. Furthermore, the heat between the two stars was tepid at best, as were the performances that wavered between mildly amused and comatose.<br /><br />The Tourist is a gorgeous movie that surprised me more than I thought it would with touches of droll humor and a nostalgic tip of the hat to movies we are hard-pressed to find anymore. In the end, however, it seemed only able to recreate the lovely wrapping paper while leaving the box inside empty.
B006ON41FC|5.0|good graphics and music. no glitches on fire. don't usually like these types of games much, but the goals make it very addictive.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would hesitate to call this science fiction. It seems to me to be more of a post-apocolyptic adventure.<br /><br />That said, it is a wonderful read, well worth the asking price. It is the type of book that I will read several times over.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this one take the plunge, I believe that you will not be disappointed in this one!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Thus far this is the 4th book that I have read ever since the series aired on HBO and I will say that this is the only book series that I have read where the actual book and series match.  All books are usually better than the series; however the books are pratically verbatim to the series.  Once I realized that I couldn't stop reading book after book.  I also found that each book is a complete season of Game of Thrones on HBO.  Great buy and I don't regret reading the books!
0671027344|5.0|I'd been wanting to read this book for quite some time. I'd heard great things, but nothing can really do it justice.. you just have to experience it yourself.<br /><br />Beautifully written. Read it all in one sitting.. then proceeded to inform all of my friends that they MUST check it out. I actually had one that promptly did. :) And he loved it as well.<br /><br />Will no doubt be reading this again and again.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I love this flash. I bought the SB900 and sold it within a couple weeks. It would over heat on a regular basis, right in the middle of a wedding shoot... not good!! I've always loved my old SB600's; they work and work and work without ever failing. I'm finding a very similar performance with the SB700. Nikon clearly got it right with this flash. The SB910 is hopefully also an improvement.<br /><br />APRIL 3, 2012 UPDATE!!<br /><br />I've used my SB700 on several weddings (hellandphoto.com)as well as model portfolios. In a word... I am AMAZED; not only by the amount to light it produces but also by the QUALITY of the light. Smooth, smooth, smooth! I keep the included diffusion dome on at all times. Also... and this is important to know... I shoot and shoot and shoot and it DOES NOT OVERHEAT!!!

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Quite possibly one of the WORST movies I have ever seen, and way too long on top of that! The CGI was good, but way over used and made the movie feel like a bad video game. Acting was terrible, especially from someone as well known for her acting in Alien, Sigourney Weaver, and the plot was SO cliched as to be ridiculous! Dances With Wolves in Space is how I see this film, and it's an insult to compare this POS to Kevin Costner's EPIC movie! I absolutely HATED this movie, and will never see it again, nor any possible sequels. Cameron has made some classics, but this one is NOT in that group!!

B005GFSKFG|5.0|Here is a marvelous, must-have recording of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier (Book One), one that exceeds Richter's own legendary murky 1972/73 recording at Klessheim Castle, Salzburg. The sound may be superior here, but much of the performance remains the same: variation of tempi, dynamics, and sheer bluster between each prelude and fugue, and a contrapuntal mastery and spiritual awareness in this literature that is second to none. For a piano recording of the WTC, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find better -- this is a typically mesmerizing Richter recital, one that is only enhanced by the live atmosphere.<br /><br />Sonically speaking, the live sound in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory is very good throughout, not too close and not too distant. For the most part, the audience is quiet with only a handful of coughs and little rustling; that said, you won't mistake this for a Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin clinic in the sterilized confines of Henry Wood Hall, and all to the better for it. This is an event, with all of the 'you are there' immediacy and impact one could wish for. Regarding the remastering of the original stereo source, Melodiya seems to have turned a corner in recent years. The work by M. Pilipov is excellent, sounding to me like a 24-bit job, without intrusive noise filtering (e.g. recent historical recordings on the Profil label) and also without the signature 'processed' sound that is the unwanted byproduct of Digital Workstations, &agrave; la Supraphon's Karel An'erl Gold Edition and some of EMI's latter-day ART remasters (Maria Callas anyone?).

On the one hand, his performance appears to be within the boundaries predetermined by the specifics of clavier art from Bach's time.

B00005Q66Y|4.0|Gunter Wand's recording with the BPO of the Bruckner Symphony no. 8 in its original version is for me something of a small revelation. In the title of my reiview I called Gunter Wand \\"An Unsung German Master\\". I mean this to say that on the podium he was a master musician and conductor. His Bruckner recordings as well as all of his other recordings are all classics. To the recording at hand.<br />Wand and the BPO bring a liveliness to this work that many others overlook. For instance the Scherzo movement usually sounds heavy and dark for forbidding; here Wand and the orchestra lighten things up a great deal and the sound is at once glorious. The Adagio movement has seldom been played better. The Finale can only be called stunning. As for the persons who in their reviews complained about the person coughing, thats the risks that recording companies take when doing it live.<br />I will be the first to admit it bugs me when it happens and it always seems to happen. As for Gunter Wand being \\"Unsung\\" he liked it that way he did not seek the lime light he did not want to be a superstar he just wanted to interpret great music which he did as well, or better than most. Other recordings I can suggest to listeners are the Maazel,BPO on EMI, the Nagano DSOB on an Arthaus DVD, and Mr Wand's Lubeck recording available from ArchivMusic.com. All of these recordings help introduce the listener to the wonder that is the Bruckner sound world.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I bought this because of all the great reviews, including those of the HBO version.<br /><br />I start reading, and then on page two, he writes:  \\"...it made the trees rustle like living things.\\"  Trees are living things, they're not like living things.  I almost stopped reading it then.<br /><br />I'm well into it now, and I have come to the following conclusions:<br /><br />1. This is like Babylon 5.  Amazing story arc, amazing idea, writing and acting so over the top it sometimes distracts from that.  The depth and breadth of the story and its potential are a 12 out of 10, the writing is not even close to that.  \\"Ser\\" instead of \\"sir\\", \\"maester\\", et al.  Too many words written just to be pretentious, not because they add to the story, in my opinion.<br /><br />2. Too many 13 year old kids having sex.  He could have made everyone in the story 3 to 4 years older and not taken away one positive element, while not giving us the visuals.  I looked to see what HBO did with Daenerys, the woman that plays her is clearly a woman, not meant to be 13.<br /><br />All that said, an enjoyable read that unfortunately keeps hitting you in the face with how much better it could have been.

It's an inspirational, courageous and empowering story about very different extraordinary women in the 1960s South who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project that breaks society's rules and puts them at risk.<br /><br />The movie is filled with poignancy, humor and hope. Also messages all audiences should take heed of regarding who we are as people.<br /><br />All performances were outstanding,deserving of even more public recognition, awards and credits received. Should have won the Academy Award for sure.

For PDF, I prefer other apps.<br />It seems to me that the integration with the cloud works even better than before.<br />This app approaches asymptotically the MS Office, at least for my needs.
0307719219|5.0|One of the most fascinating history/economics type books I've read in years.  Everything that I thought caused nations to fail was apparently wrong.  It's very clearly written and organized and covers nations from past and present...the mistakes made 2000 years ago to ones made 20 years ago.  If anyone is wondering if their nation is taking the wrong road in these confusing & tough times this book may answer some of your questions or at the very least put things in a new perspective.
1568363931|4.0|I worked for a Japanese view camera manufacturer for many years (before digital took over the world) and spent quite a bit of time traveling between major Japanese cities via the Shinkansen (Bullet Train).  It was then that I fell in love with the bento box.  Although they served food on the trains experienced travelers waited until they pulled into a station to rush out and grab a bento box from one of the many vendors that occupied the various terminals.  I would buy the biggest, most expensive one that they had (I was on an expense account back then, plus, being a big man I eat as much as an average Japanese family) and then hurry back to my seat in the Green Car.  My culinary treasures varied from city to city.  Fresh fish, oysters, uni, sea weed, rice, cucumbers, radishes, fruit, edible flowers and so much more.  Not to evoke a cliche but to me a bento box evokes the essence of Zen philosophy. Simple yet amazingly complex.  I seldom visit Japan anymore (unfortunately) but my love for the country and its food is as strong as ever.<br /><br />My oldest son - who first visited Japan when he was 12 - recently married a wonderful young woman from Kyoto.  Spending time with her and her family reminded me of why I love both their country and their food culture.  I bought a really nice [[ASIN:B000246GSE bento container]] and decided to find a cookbook that I could use here in San Antonio.  Although I admire the traditional bento form I understand that it is impractical to try to recreate it here in the US. The 'Just Bento Cookbook' understands this.  Written by a Japanese woman living in the US the author wisely avoided fresh items that would be either impossible to find in the US or prohibitively expensive.  There are still Japanese inspired dishes to be sure, along with a few unique Mediterranean and American influenced recipes.  Fortunately the author created recipes the are very easy to shop for.  There are a lot of good ideas as well as instructions in this book and I am sure that I will be using it often.nd I am sure that I will be using it often.

B000JQUKKU|4.0|This classic story has been around through several generations and it continues to captivate a new audience. Even non-christians find interest in this story because it causes us to look at ourselves and reevaluate how we want to be perceived after death. While I was familiar with this story before reading it due to several movies, there is nothing like getting the details from the original story.  I would recommend this book to those familiar and unfamiliar with the story because its classic writing technique and story line will surely leave you wondering about yourself.

B0054JELS4|5.0|Husband LOVES this show! He would watch the reruns late at night before sleeping, but it certainly bugged him with commercials and silly editing. We decided a year ago to give up paying for satellite dish as the pricing escalated and the quality of signal went down, so I decided to look for his favorite shows on DVD, and he could watch without interruption.  Lucky me! One day this was the Deal of the Day! I snapped it up and gave it to him for his birthday.  I know I will have to buy the next season soon, but the price I paid for this was astounding, so the savings will be applied to the upcoming seasons as they are released. The acting is wonderful, and I even  spend a few minutes catching some viewing.  The quality of production of the DVDs is top grade, with each season in its own case, with notes of the show, including original air date, a brief synopsis, commentary from cast members, subtitles and optimized for today's larger TV screens. Great package all around and what a terrific gift its been. You can grab a season and tuck it in your purse or briefcase and tote your favorite show with you.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is one of the best workout DVD's I've used and owned. The 3 interval/segments are great. I found the first one a bit boring. It was too easy for me. Level 2 & 3 I love! Love Love Love! It's a quick 28 mins of butt kicking sweating like crazy workout. It's hard for sure. There are two problems I have with this DVD. The jumping jacks kill my knees, I normally do another form of cardio while the jumping jack segment is going), and two she goes from floor work to upright work too quickly. It is tough to go from sit down to stand up so fast. Bob Harper's DVD will do all standing work and then floor work, which for me is better. If you are looking to ease into weights and fitness DVD's this is a good one to start. I also do this with other DVD's I have actually never done it 30 days in a row as suggested. Good Luck, it's worth the purchase!

B003ASLJMW|4.0|This tense 1982 adaptation of the Craig Thomas novel \\"Firefox\\" has Clint Eastwood as leading actor, director and producer of a high tech Cold War espionage thriller.  The movie includes what at the time were cutting edge special effects.<br /><br />As the story opens, former U.S. Air Force Major Mitchell Gant is recalled to active duty for a special mission.  He has been chosen to steal a top secret Soviet prototype fighter aircraft called the Firefox (a stealth look-alike) from its base deep in the Soviet Union.  Gant, a Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD, looks like a long shot for the mission, which calls for an ace pilot fluent in Russian.  Nevertheless, the CIA and British MI-6 launch him on the mission.<br /><br />In a dangerous if improbable journey, Gant is sherparded across Russia by a network of spies and dissidents, just ahead of the pursuing KGB.  Gant reaches planeside about halfway through the movie, and the real action begins.  Gant must run a harrowing gauntlet of anti-aircraft missiles, Soviet fighters, and a failing fuel supply to reach safety, while flying an unfamiliar aircraft.<br /><br />The movie is perhaps overlong, and there is an unintentionally funny attempt to substitute northern California for Alaska in the opening sequence, but the special effects are fun, and Eastwood is backed by a solide supporting cast of B actors in a suspenseful thriller.  \\"Firefox\\" is highly recommended to Eastwood fans.

0440180295|3.0|In SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, Vonnegut examines the emotionally flat life of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist and a rare survivor of the Allied bombing of Dresden during World War II. Using a style that is jokey yet deadpan, Vonnegut shows Billy, a boyish soldier in the war, prone to weepy breakdown in his money-grubbing forties. Then, he survives a plane crash, probably with brain trauma, and his wife dies suddenly and Billy starts to believe he has been kidnapped by aliens who experience time in the fourth dimension. Long story short, Billy, in Vonnegut's phrase, becomes unstuck in time, living a moment here... a moment there. Among these moments are loving experiences on the thinly imagined planet of Tralfamadore, where he domiciles in a zoo with a Hollywood starlet and starts a family.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, these aliens enable Vonnegut to pronounce a few BIG THOUGHTS--there is no why; only on earth is there any talk of free will. Further, Billy's belief in these aliens and his acceptance of their four-dimensional perspective ultimately allows him to cope, albeit pathetically, with the immense scale of death in his life. \\"Everything is all right, and everybody has to do exactly what he does,\\" is what these aliens teach the helpless and passive Billy, who seems unable to reach and express any anger. Not to ruin the fun: but the Tralfamadorians exist, IMHO, to enable Billy to rationalize the ghastly traumas in his existence.<br /><br />Vonnegut writes SF in highly gimmicky style. Whenever he mentions a death, he recites the phrase, \\"So it goes.\\" Initially, the use of this phrase--basically, a slightly flip acquiescence--seems intended to tick the ubiquitous presence of death near Billy. (My count is 98 SIGs in this novella.) But the use of this phrase also serves to pace Vonnegut's fiction. When it's used, the reader has to stop momentarily, since the phrase is a blip in the flow. This is okay, I guess, although this mannerism helped unleash an absolute tsunami of whimsical stylists and Vonnegut wannabes, who think cute is okay.<br /><br />But then, this reader began to realize that Vonnegut's use of gimmicky pacing in SF is relentless. Here, I arbitrarily turn to a page in Chapter 9 and I see three separate clumps of paragraphs. I turn to Chapter 5 and, voila! ...another page with three separate paragraph clusters. But a close reader can look at these clusters and see that the narrative usually flows without real break from cluster to cluster. IMO, what Vonnegut has done is to insert these divisions in order to pace his text, which otherwise scans normally. Somehow, this endows what are usually the most ORDINARY observations with tiny ineffable tweaks of melancholy significance. Kurt, in other words, shows a genius for manipulating his reader via the wonders of spacing.<br /><br />SF published in 1969 when literature was--certainly more than today--in the hands of high-brows and tasteful gatekeepers. In that environment, readers, especially counterculture collegians, probably enjoyed Vonnegut's references to popular American culture, which showed he was not a stuffed-shirt. And this, as much as his great mop of curly hair, probably helped to make him a celebrity novelist. But I read SF today and these references make the book seem second-rate and even lazy. At one point, for example, Billy awakens in a hospital and notices an ominous presence monitoring him. I, for one, wonder what Nabokov, DeLillo, Roth, or Pynchon would do with this moment, when the boyish Billy experiences terror. But Vonnegut? He dips into popular culture and Billy associates this sinister presence with a VAMPIRE! I mean, come on! Isn't a good writer supposed to do more with his material than that?<br /><br />A final point: Do the drawings show any real talent? And if they don't, are they necessary?al stylists and Vonnegut wannabes, who think cute is okay.<br /><br />But then, this reader began to realize that Vonnegut's use of gimmicky pacing in SF is relentless.

B003ASLJO0|3.0|Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) \\"at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us\\".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life. Let's just hope mr. Eastwood had a blackout, let's just hope his sense of quality returns.

B006362ZR6|3.0|The Fray seem to have finally found their footing as a band. The debut seemed undecided with they wanted to be Coldplay or Maroon 5, then they toughened up for Fray 2, and on \\"Scars and Stories,\\" they pick at their inner U2. While that may have to do with The Fray touring with Bono and Company, lead singer Isaac Stern is pushing himself lyrically and earnestly, trying to give the band an identity. \\"Scars And Stories\\" moves the band forward in a good way.<br /><br />Granted, The Fray aim straight for the commercial bulls-eye. The songs are lush and tightly produced by Brandon O'Brien (Pearl Jam, Aerosmtih), giving the band a much needed edge. However, 'edge' to The Fray means fine-tuned harmonies and near perfect song structure. The opening single \\"Heartbeat\\" cold easily have been a Coldplay outtake, but that means it's a consistently pleasing single. Same with the chants on \\"1961,\\" where \\"it won't be the same again...\\" - kind of ironic that the band's parents were likely kids in the year in question. It does mean that nostalgia for a good pop hook is a priority for these guys.<br /><br />\\"Scars and Stories\\" is decent pop-stuff. It's the best of their albums so far, and there's visible growth in what The Fray has to offer. The cover has the band racing across a field, towards what only the future will reveal. But if they can come up with songs as good as \\"Heartbeat\\" or the catchy and folksy travelogue \\"48 to Go\\" or the beautiful lullaby closer \\"Be Still,\\" they may still find their way into greatness.

Brilliant as a story, but also excellent for those young teens interested in the politics of revolution.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|So I just spent the entire day (starting at 10:00 am and now it's 2:00 am) reading this book and it completely blew me away!!  I'm not very good at writing comprehensive reviews, so I'll just highlight two things that I really loved about this book that I think is missing from a lot of other really good fantasy works (the ingredients that make it go beyond five stars).<br /><br />1) I really hate the endless pages of self-loathing that many fantasy authors feel compelled to write whenever heroes need to kill.  It's a very important point to carry across that killing, even in the name of \\"good\\", is sometimes necessary, but never without an incalculable price.  Necessity cannot alchemize an evil act into something other.  The heavy handed way in which this is usually done in fantasy fiction is when the hero rails ceaselessly against their own actions, decrying themselves as monsters, at which point they are embraced by some love interest who tells them that they are really a good person after all. It just always seemed to me that such self loathing is unbecoming in a hero since it's purely a selfish feeling that doesn't help anyone else. I can usually put up with this for like 20 pages but when it becomes a recurring theme, I get really annoyed.  There's none of this in this book.  I'm not sure exactly how the author managed to convey it, but there's a certain sense of dignity about Vaelin that tells you that he feels the weight of the lives he's taken without him resorting to whining (so he actually whines for about 2 paragraphs before he essentially gets slapped and told to stop feeling sorry for himself).<br /><br />2) The author has a real gift for introducing plot details that take a while to understand (adding flavor to the story along the way) but which are satisfactorily resolved in the end (very few loose ends here).  My favorite was the story of the \\"Witch's Bastard\\" which we are introduced to halfway in the book.  At first, I had no idea what the story wassupposed to mean in the context of the plot, but I think by the end, I could make a pretty good guess, and trying to interpret the story really allowed me to see everything that happened in a new light (very cool!).<br /><br />Please, please get this book.  It was absolutely awesome!  Best fantasy I've read in the past five years.
0756407125|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed the book (despite nothing really happening as others have pointed out), but Kvothe has become an obnoxious character.<br /><br />There are probably spoilers here, so don't continue reading if you haven't read the book yet.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Kvothe as a character in the Name of the Wind.  There was something oddly relatable about him (even though he was constantly dealt the worst hand of cards throughout the first book).  I was personally able to connect with him and would honestly feel bad for him when things kept going terribly.  However, during this book, Kvothe went from a slightly arrogant but pitiful protagonist to full on douche bag.  Were he a real person, he'd be someone I would never want to interact with.  I felt like the entire book we were listening to him talk about how amazing he is at the lute, artificing, poetry, having sex, acting, sympathy, calling the wind, making girls fall in love with him, picking up languages, learning the Ketan, etc.  It is just too much.  I know he is supposed to be an epic hero, but how am I supposed to relate to him at all if the only thing he admits to being bad at is dealing with Denna?  His arrogance is so nauseating, and he better not continue to tell me how 'Edema Ruh' he is every three chapters in the next book too.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure how this story is going to end in one more book.  Since the first book, we've only managed to cover about 5 years of his life.  At some point, I assume he has to kill a king, and he still needs to get kicked out of university (as he stated in the last chapter of the first book).  While true, we don't know how old he is as he's telling the story (the author even hints he may be young still), it seems like we have a lot of ground to cover to bring us to the present (since we apparently still have a plot that has to happen involving Bast and those scrael or whatever that we haven't heard from since the first chapter of the book).  I'm just not quite sure how it's all going to work.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I frequent the Popular Science website and found this number rated at the top board games in the US. Of course if PopSci says its good, then it will damn well be worth the money. I actually had no idea what to do after opening the box but thanks to the handy instructions guide, my friends and I were playing without any help from the rulebook within 15 minutes. I have to say the game became really intense. What really sold this board game for me was its little reliance on luck. If two players decide to go against the others, or if everyone decides to give one player a hard time, so be it. Being able to control the outcome without the roll of the die adds that personal touch making each game unique. Great purchase.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved these books...I kept yearning for more detailed sex, but thankfully not the play room which Ana referred to \\"the red room of pain.\\" I do enjoy the bondage though. Are men really capable of sex that many times a day?  Wow! Have I missed out on life.<br /><br />But, the love story was always present and kept me spellbound.  I read the first one on Saturday, the 2nd on Sunday, and the third on Monday.<br />Yesterday I began reading them again...Why?  There was a lot of romance in these novels...Sex and romance is what I love to read about..  I knew he would become the one 'dominated\\" by his love for her. I also love the epilogue where Christian talked a little about his reactions to her when he met her.....more more please from Christians point of view. I would like Ms James to write one from Christian's point of few.<br /><br />I did not like that the author skipped the part of moving into the new house, the birth of Ted and Taylor marrying the housekeeper, and pregnant with a daughter...that could have been another book.<br /><br />I am a senior age 68..even with it's faults I found the love story very pleasing, and I have read the series 4 times now...lol!
006197806X|4.0|There is much to like about this second book of the trilogy.<br /><br />I won't resort to spoilers; I'll just say that now that I've read the end of this book, I wish I'd just put it away and waited until I had the third book ready to go, as well. It wasn't the kind of ending that leaves you ready to savor the pause between the stories. There is no pause - it just cuts off, and it's \\"tune in next time\\"... meh.  YMMV, but my vote is, wait and read the second and third books together like one long book.  JMHO.

It has many different tile layouts to keep you busy for hours, and the graphics are great... So Love it for that reason. On the other hand, not sure if it's a problem with the app or not, but after about 20 mins of play time I get booted from the app and sent back to my home screen. I can go right back into the app with no problems, but it kind of sucks to have to restart my level all over again....Very Frustrating!!!! And it happens everytime!!!! I've reported the issue & have done an update on the app hoping that maybe it would resolved the issue....nope still get booted!!!.......If you can handle the annoyance of getting booted every 20 mins then this is a great game!!!!!
1442346272|5.0|Love this book!  What an insight into the the character of this visionary. He knew how to make the best of other people's creations, knew how market and to make them valuable.  Yet, his personality bordered upon mental illness.  So amazing that the drive that would have caused any normal person to be fired, would normally have made anyone hate him, actually developed a virtual cult that would have NOTHING but what he graced.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel kept my interest throughout.  It really made me consider \\"Nature vs. Nurture\\" in an unusual way.  I could sympathize with the parents and understand the conflicted feelings they had toward their son.  I especially loved the fact that I did not see the ending coming.  I love a book that makes me think and surprises me.  This one did both.
B0073Q0IY2|4.0|A big fan of John Carpenter's original The Thing.  You should watch this one and immediately follow it up with John Carpenter's for continuity.  Special Effects are naturally much better than Carpenter's but it stayed true to the storyline.  A must have.
0553386794|1.0|Had I written a review of Game of Thrones after reading the first book, it would be a solid 5 star review.  Perhaps after the second in the series it would be the same, but after the third I could in honesty only have rated it a 3 or 4.  However, after the 4th in this series I can only conclude that Mr. Martin is both a gifted writer of fiction as well as an author whose work should be ignored.<br /><br />To begin with, while the author writes well, he must be paid by the word since these novels are absolutely interminable in length.  If you plan on being marooned for a few years on an island, or go to prison to do a nickel, just take this series with you.  You'll still not finish.  Second, the interesting alternating point of view between characters in the first three books metastasizes in the fourth with the addition of scores of new characters and their points of view while the points of view of other interesting characters developed in the first three suddenly disappear.  Cases in point - Tyrion, the dwarf brother of the evil Jaime, is one of the most interesting characters in the first three volumes, yet he inexplicably disappears in the fourth.  The second most interesting character in the volumes 1 - 3, Jon Snow, the bastard son of Eddard Stark, also makes no appearance in volume 4.  Same with the third most interesting character, Danerys.  Putting down volume 3, you really want to know what happens to her next.  Fuggetaboutit.  She's gone from volume 4.  Imagine the Lord of Rings, where each volume is 3 times longer and Frodo Baggins makes no appearance in the third volume.<br /><br />Additionally, Mr. Martin likes to kill off his most important characters, or render them suddenly blind, or convert them from being evil to nice.  Again, imagine Lord of the Rings, where Aragorn chokes to death on a mouthful of ale in the Two Towers, or Sauron turns out to be really a nice guy who's just irritated because a turkey buzzard flew into and got stuck in his big red eye.<br /><br />I guess my advice is to plow through these if you really don't mind being bitch slapped by an author.  The writing is excellent and the world created intriguing.  However, the story goes nowhere, and gets to nowhere via thousands of pages, all the while inserting and removing and altering characters at will.  I gather that many are waiting for the grand finale in volume 6 that Martin has promised.  If there is a God in heaven, we shall be spared.<br /><br />But if after this warning you still proceed on this irritating quest, do what I did.  When you finally figure out that you are being punked by the author, ignore the sequence of the chapters.  Just start with a character point of view and read each one for that character sequentially.  There is a bare semblance of a plot anyway, so Lord knows, you won't spoil anything by reading ahead for a particular character since nothing happens anyway.  When you get to volume 4, ignore all the randomly introduced new characters who add nothing to the story developed in the first three.  This way, you can impose some small amount of coherence on an otherwise completely incoherent story structure, and trust me, you won't lose anything in the process, mostly because there is nothing to lose in the first place.eye.<br /><br />I guess my advice is to plow through these if you really don't mind being bitch slapped by an author.

B006VREOOY|4.0|I'm a Jason Statham fan, so I usually enjoy anything he's in.  I was expecting a remake of the original Killer Elite, with Arthur Miller, James Caan and Robert Duvall, which is a great movie.  But overall, this is worth watching and is a movie I would add to my collection.  It just a different story with the same name.  But both good.
B00067BBQE|1.0|Dizzy, I'm so dizzy my head is spinning<br /> Like a whirlpool it never ends<br /> And it's You girl makin' it spin<br /> You're making me dizzy
B0073PZN8O|4.0|Not a bad movie.  better than I expected and better than the original Logan's Run since the technology was updated.  JT played it well.  Worth adding to your library.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|The latest release from Chickenfoot III, in my mind, is their best effort yet. Good mix of blues, rock and a couple slow groove tunes that are in constant rotation on my iPod. Get it!
B0072X2O66|5.0|Been waiting a long time for some good old Trashing !!!!<br />Great album , the amount of talent is eminence !<br />Russel Allan's voice is one of the best in metal music being melodic and forceful at the same time .<br />Keep up the good work guys !!<br /><br />D.
0739378333|5.0|Excellant book.  As with all of John Grishom's books, this is a fast paced, intelligent novel about the inner workings of the legal profession.  A \\"must read\\".
B007BDK3SS|5.0|This is a good game.  I hate the fools that post their spam with one star.  Booga booga booga.  The end.
0553801473|1.0|I slogged through 740 pages of this snail-paced rambling tome, finally making it to \\"The Iron Suitor\\", and suddenly realized that I didn't care about the Iron Suitor, or anything else that might come in this poorly edited, poorly conceived and poorly executed monstrosity. And this took YEARS to write??? The American Tolkien???  What a joke!<br /><br />It's as though Martin hired a hack ghost writer for \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and this mediocrity.  Otherwise he is burned out. His first three of the series were brilliant, but the last two, what disappointments, but more importantly a terrible waste of time.<br /><br />One star for duping me into buying it.<br /><br />See Anodyne115's review for detailed insight.
0553801503|5.0|I think most of these reviews have been way too critical of AFfC. It is basically group think at this point. People come here to read the reviews of this book BEFORE they read it, and it's fate is pretty much sealed.<br /><br />With that being said, this book is probably the weakest of the 4 (not sure about ADwD). That doesn't justify one star reviews. If the first 3 were five stars, this is four at the leeast. It is still a good book! The Cersei, Jamie and Arya chapters are all great. The Iron Island and Dorne chapters give you good insight into other locations in Westeros. The Brienne and Sam chapters left me wanting more. Like all the books, it starts slow and ends strong.<br /><br />Summmary: If you have read the first 3 books, you absolutley should read this one. I thought it had similar pacing to the first book. AFfC may be more subtle then the other books, but it is still great none the less.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Working perfectly, no complains about it, and it is a must if you are buying an console, I'm not sure about non-official controlers, but never tested them. This one worth its price
B0063IH60K|5.0|I down loaded this game on my new kindle fire. I love the smooth, fast action. will recommend this to anyone with a kindle, who like playing solitaire.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story lines - yes, the characters are \\"out there\\" but that's what makes this book so entertaining.  I don't read fiction for reality, I read it for entertainment.  I was annoyed by the constant overuse of phrases like 'laters baby', and 'mercurial'.  And at times I tired of the love scenes as they became almost predictable in that he kisses her, she grabs his hair, he grabs her \\"sex\\", she has an orgasm and then he does then it's over.  I sum up these books this way: they meet, they fight, they eat, they fight, they have sex, they eat...wash, rinse, repeat.  Nonetheless, I couldn't stop reading.
0783231202|5.0|When I purchased this DVD I had never watched the movie before and was anxious to see it. It met all my expectations. While the story line is one that is difficult to watch at times, it is a part of our history and needs to be told. The actors were great, the portrayal of the cruelty to the slaves frank but sensitive, and the message powerful. This is one to keep.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great overall game. really fun and never gets old. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good way to waste time
B0052UZIFA|2.0|this game is great, however a fix needs to be made for the galaxy nexus. freezes on first level, sometimes before that. fix and the 5 stars will come back.
B006362ZR6|5.0|This is a fantastic album by The Fray. They are one of my favorite groups and this new set of tunes does not disappoint.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|I am a rabid Smiths fan and have been since 'this charming man' hit the airwaves back in the 80's. Repackage, reissue, re-evaluate... as they say. The remastered versions of the songs are incredible, but how many different versions of 'greatest hits' albums do you really need? It seems that Johnny Marr took this opportunity to turn up the guitars and drums in the mix, giving us a new chance to hear what a superb band Morrissey had behind him.<br />Even though much of the complete set is redundant, it is a welcome addition to the collection of one who really does have everything now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like the games. I find them very addicting. I have not unlocked them all yet but I plan to.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I loved Despicable Me.  When I ordered it, it came promptly and I was able to enjoy it<br />again with my granddaughters.  I also am satisfied ordering from Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the books immensely. Couldn't hardly put it down. The story is great and you fall in love with certain characters. I would recommend reading this trilogy, well worth the time!
B006LG590S|5.0|Romantically speaking, the delicate crescendo of unfinished love dominates this powerful classic (easily one of the finest dramatic musicals ever produced). The unfolding of love, passion, and intimacy between Tony and Maria, like the riptide, spills into the soul of this film. Their whispered and orchestrated words on the balcony create nuances beyond the realm of normal drama. Their marriage before God establishes their union, solidifies the romantic crescendo, and allows Maria to mourn her husband's death at the end. It is a complete tragedy on all respective levels.<br /><br />All meetings between Tony (played by Richard Beymer) and Maria (played by Natalie Wood) are stunning in presentation. The musical overtures are superb, the dancing is brilliant, and the conflict between the Jets and Sharks (women included) has its own originality in classical terms. Yet, Maria alone commands the stage in virtually all tender moments (except those involving Anita); our heroine's softness, intelligence, and untested wisdom establishes her emotive control of the play (start to finish). In as much as her humility does not detract from the other powerful performances, Maria displays honor, sacrifice, depth, and commitment throughout the entire drama. We observe Natalie Wood in her finest hour as a gifted actress.<br /><br />The principles of romantic tragedy dominant this play in its careful adherence to the plot and character development within Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (who is Maria's unspoken mentor in matters of passion and control of one's lover). She redirects Tony away from secreted romance into the tragic consequences of interfering with the rumble; the deaths of Bernardo (her brother) and Riff (Tony's closest friend) are related (within dramatic irony) to her secret intervention (supposedly on their behalf). In truth, this masterpiece resides in both categories, tragedy and romance; bound (perhaps) by her mournful voice, \\"Don't you touch him!\\" Our catharsis is directly affected by Maria's youthful passion related to unfinished love in its most delicate stages.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This is Whitney's self titled, debut. It came out in 1985. This c.d. does not fall from absoulutely spectacular.<br /><br />  The c.d.'s first single is \\"you give good love\\". I do not remember a song before, or after this song was released, that sounds like this song. It is a beautiful song.<br />  There is even a little Jackson 5, magic on here. Jermaine Jackson did two duets with Whitney on this cd. There is the beautiful ballad \\"Nobody loves you like i do\\". Jermaine also apears with Whitney, on the Jackson 5ish, uptempo song, Take good care of my heart. Jermaine, also produced the song for Whitney, Some One To Love. That song is also on this c.d.<br />  Jermaine Jackson, singing and production work on this c.d. is by far,his best work outside the Jackson 5.<br />  The music on this c.d. is versatile, there is funk, soul, pop. It even has some jazz on Whitneys hit, \\"saving all my love\\".

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This was a wonderfully written story that at times has you feeling like Alice peering through the looking glass.  Regretfully, the end leaves a bit to be desired as the writer suddenly changes the narrative and fails to answer the questions a reader is actually grasping at.  Ultimately, however, the book has stayed with me and I'm still considering even the smallest of nuisances and how they substantially alter the characters and their impact to the story.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Sophie Kinsella creates engaging and endearing main characters like no other and Poppy Wyatt in I've Got Your Number is no exception. She's the kind of person you can't help but root for, and there were so many times I just wanted to give her a big hug. She had a huge heart!<br /><br />Poppy freaks out when she loses her engagement ring, a family heirloom. To make matters worse, her phone is stolen and so anyone who finds the ring will not know how to get in touch with her! Poppy spots a phone in a garbage bin and makes it her own, much to the initial dismay of the phone's rightful owner. But as a result of sharing the phone with this man, Poppy's life is changed forever.<br /><br />Like most Kinsella books the plot was a bit outlandish but it worked and the chemistry between Poppy and Sam was evident from the start. Although I thought the ending was going to be predictable, I didn't care because the journey to get there was so much fun and then the last few pages had me biting my nails wondering if I had predicted incorrectly after all.<br /><br />I had to remove one star simply because of the footnotes, more accurately called \\"End notes.\\" While I assume they were witty, placement at the end of the chapter was annoying because by the time I got to the end of the chapter, I forgot what the footnotes were about and had no desire to go backwards to find out. I didn't think they added anything to the story and, in fact, they detracted from my enjoyment and left me frustrated.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|If you're looking for a quirky horror comedy film that feels a little bit like Shaun of the Dead but is unique. This might just be the film you're looking for.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Hey George CLOONEY HAS AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE; PLAY'NG A LONELY COWBOY. I watched that movie 2 times in two months already. Shall I watch one more time next month? Probably... Nobody should have problem watching that one. Especially those who is sick and tired one cast copy Hollywood movies...<br />Enjoy!
1470157578|4.0|The third book in the series certainly packs a punch.  Amber Fox who has become one of my favorite sleuths is back with her wit and her appetite.  Definitely dealing with a darker subject in this one but overall very enjoyable and entertaining.  Amber even gets her much anticipated happy ending.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|This movie was horrible.  This is not a movie for kids and I regret spending my time and money watching it.  I did not even think it was appropriate for my 14 year old.  The two krill characters were completely unnecessary and offensive.
0439023483|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I've ever read and I've read many. Classified as a young adult novel, but this book caught my full attention as well as many other older friends and family. I'm a 21 year old woman, who pretty much grew up in my elementary years with the Harry Potter craze & then high school years with the Twilight craze, but was never that much amused with those, but The Hunger Games totally through me off guard once I picked it up. A fast-read that will make you feel like you're actually in the Hunger Games with how well Suzanne Collins writes this masterpiece. I recommend this book to everyone, of all ages because it is THAT fascinating. Awaiting my boxset to arrive I ordered off here to finally start on the 2nd and 3rd book. Can't wait :]
0891419063|5.0|E.B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge writes an amazing memoir of the Marine Corps in WWII and one of its great, forgotten battles, Peleliu. Sledge brings home the utter brutality of war in vivid descriptions. You have to wonder how different WWII might have been if we had the same ease of instant communications that we have today. The soldiers, sailors and Marines of that era were so isolated in these forlorn locations.<br /><br />His insights on human nature, the esprit de corps of the US Marines and the bonds that are forged in war are just great.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I guess secretly you know that the food we eat day to day had checmicals, pestisides, bacteria and whatnot but we get so caught up in our day to day worlds to stop and really soak this in. This movie will give you 1.5 hours of true and honest circumstances that these farmers and workers come accross that we as consumers really never think about. It's a must watch for those who care about perservation of the soul, our bodies, our families and environments and mother earth itself. Thank you for giving us this reality check. :)I will certainly think about what I ingest from now on.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This is not a typical Grisham yarn.  It is laced with humor more than any of his previous stories and with time, JG has become a better writer.  There are thousands of graduates from our Nation's top law schools laboring away in large, corporate<br />offices with 100+ lawyers, billing 3,000 hours+ annually who despise their work and life style, but who are likewise addicted to the comforts that a substantial income provides.  How many of them would like to practice tort law or criminal defense<br />but are unwilling to forfeit the privileges their practices provide?<br /><br />Grisham gives us a glimpse of one story in that genre and how the other half of the profession lives.  He ridicules the class action tort lawyers who flit about the country in their Gulfstream aircraft, their bespoke clothing, their 20,000 square ft.<br />mainstay dwellings and massive settlements.  This is a very entertaining read.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I tried this on my Toshiba Thrive and it continually crashed. After one reinstall it still did the same thing so I finally had to uninstall it. Maybe it is great on other platforms, but I would not recommend it for a Toshiba Thrive
B002ZE85YW|3.0|I wish I would have looked at all of the reviews closely.  The seller says nothing about this movie no longer having an active digital copy.  Since I bought the movie exclusively so that I could have the digital copy it was a \\"let down\\" when I discovered the fine print on the packaging.  DO NOT make the same mistake I made...If you are buying this for the digital movie insert - keep walking.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have to say this was a page-turner for me all the way through. This is a well written trilogy and very engaging from start to finish. This series may not be for everyone. I would say even though this is targeted at young adults I think many adults will also enjoy this. You will probably only like it if you are into dystopia-type stories, though. Most of the book is pretty tame in how it handles death and romance, but there are a few exceptions where things are noticeably more gory than the rest of the books. There is no swearing (which proves you don't have to have profanity to make a book good) and overall I think this book would be suitable for anyone about 13 and up. I would even say 10 or 11 maybe if it wasn't for the few gory spots, but if you have a pretty mature child that age it will probably be OK.<br /><br />I think one point of the book is to think about what humans are at their very base. What will some people do to get and stay in power? What will people allow to happen when they feel they have absolutely no power to change things? How far will people go to preserve their own life? I'm not saying this book completely answers those questions, but I think if you look at human history and even some places today you can find parallels to just how cruel people can be and how there are those who have no regard for the pain and suffering of others as long as it benefits them. Overall, I think this is a good read and would recommend it.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|A fun game that it's easy enough to put down.  Good four the few minutes in between work, standing in line or whatever.
B001E95KVA|5.0|Polak offers a sustainable and simple, yet transformational framework for approaching poverty eradication and economic empowerment in the developing world.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|it was all right but i personaly think that trial x (the first one) as much better than this! the quality wasn't the best. and it would freeze in mid air!!! but it was not that bad and if you like these kind of games then it would be all right.
076790592X|5.0|Excellent story. The way it was written the book went quickly and by the end I cried. I am in love with Morrie Swartz.<br />The book was used for a  class in Human Growth and development. I received a very good grade.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book seemed like it was a lot more about setting up later plot lines because there wasn't as much action as in the other books.  Things definitely happened in the book, but there were some slow parts.  Still an awesome book though
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It's always mildly worrisome to purchase an older film in a newer, more detailed format but Christmas Vacation was restored very beautifully.  We were pleasantly surprised that the textures and the sound came through with such fidelity.  This is our favorite holiday film and Christmas wouldn't be possible without it.  So glad that we added this classic to our blu-ray collection!
B005C9YZIW|4.0|This production was absolutely a sea of eye candy. Just beautiful. We watched it over and over again not wanting to miss a thing. It's just beautiful and entertaining.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Contact looked better than ever on blu-ray and we're pleased with our purchase.  Particularly, the moments of sound where the signal first comes through sound amazing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent tool to have at your fingertips.  Adaptable and flexible for whenever you need your Bible &amp; you have dozens of options available.  Also allows me to have extra space on the table or in my lap.  Highly recommend.
0385342063|2.0|If you've read Sophie Kinsella before, this book will seem very familiar.  The main character, Poppy, sounds and acts the same as Ms. Kinsella's previous \\"heroines\\", the men in the story are type cast (seems perfect but is flawed, mysterious and grumpy but has a big heart...), and the plot can be guessed by the end of the first chapter.  That being said, if you need to escape into a mindless novel, this will do the trick.  Nothing wonderful, but nothing awful either.  In a nutshell, Poppy is engaged to a dog of a man who appears perfect on the surface and gives her a family heirloom ring, but Poppy feels that his family is very unhappy with the union.  Poppy loses the ring and her phone at a hotel luncheon but miraculously finds another phone in a garbage can in the hotel lobby.  Poppy becomes oddly involved with the charismatic and somewhat mysterious man who's assistant owned the phone until moments before Poppy finds it.  I don't think I even need to provide a spoiler alert notification here.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first two. They had just enough formula to make them interesting. Not so much that they got bogged down in metaphors and love triangles. This one lacks a structure to it that left me frustrated. The characters seemed to be not as strong trying to get to the ending. She makes them do things out of character to get to the ending.<br /><br />Now for a reality check. This isn't a bad book. It is a good book that is the conclusion to two masterworks that came before it. The series is still worth your time. Best thing is that the last 30 pages are brilliant and leave you thinking a lot about what it all meant.
0062014102|1.0|Really I was very disappointed about this book, I bougt it thinking that it was something that can improve my knowledge about the last ideas on science, but as soon I was progressing in the reading I was very annoyed ,because it is like a propaganda of ideas to be sold to people without no knowledge about the real science. I turn it down before the end.
0545265355|4.0|This series goes places that you just won't believe. It is titled Young Adult but the themes are ageless. Very well drawn characters and moral dilemmas are what make this series really special. This series gets compared with Harry Potter and Twilight all of the time. This isn't fair. This is a much different world than either one of those. This series will really make you take a look at yourself and those around you. Human nature will be something that you ponder long after you have read the last line.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I think this is a great read for all ages.  As an adult I still enjoyed it - yes the structure of the story is a little repetitive (monster, fight, travel, monster, fight, travel) but it was fun trying to guess what mythological monster he was about to face.  I would recommend this for those who like fantasy - for those who this is not your normal genre this may be a hit or miss read for you.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Accurate (36 hours) weather forecast and at a glance is all the weather information that I need which includes local warnings and watches.
0439023521|5.0|This was a great read!  It was really easy and enjoyable.  Not only was it a great read for the story line, it was also full of allusions and symbolism that gave it an enrichment.  I would recommend this series for any age and reading preference.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There's not much more that I can say that others haven't, this is a great read and a total bargain for those that are sick of the current state of ebook pricing.  Get it.  I'm actually rating and writing the review for this in the hopes that Amazon's recommendation engine will notice and seed my recommendations with more books like it, and with more of Howey's work - its that good!  Very imaginative ideas, characters, and pacing.

B005N7CA3A|5.0|Everything that went into the making of this album from the limited release vinyls, to the beautiful artwork, all solidifies the fact that this is Darren's finest work yet! SCBS is pure pop perfection. With every album Darren somehow seems to outdo himself in some way, shape, or form. Give it a listen you decide...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is a reason this book has so many 5 star reviews. Wool is one of the best stories I've read in 5 years.<br /><br />The setting is a self contained silo in a post-apocalyptic world. This is nothing new in dystopic settings but Wool brings it to life and gives a realistic feel. I easily imagined walking up flights and flights of steps just to get an after cleaning view.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and believable. There are surprises which adds interest and draws the reader in even further.<br /><br />Most importantly the characters are real and believable people dealing with an unusual situation. The protagonist is a down to earth mechanic who raises herself to meet the challenges and her own emotional needs. The antagonist is one of the best I've read in any story, instead of some maniacal toon bad guy he has real motivation and a complete understanding of the situation and resolve in his actions.<br /><br />I can add a constructive criticism; the intensity of the story was too constant. There where times I would have liked to enjoy the great setting, the good characters and explore some of the normal people in the silo.

0062082353|5.0|I've always loved hearing war stories and since I hunt and understand how important accuracy is I really admire a well placed shot, and this book covered it all. He went into detail without being overly graphic and told stories from a point of view you never hear on the news. A really good book and I'm glad He lived to write it.
0312641893|5.0|What do you get when you take Cinderella, make her a cyborg, and set her down in post-WWIV China? Throw in a looming war with the Lunar kingdom and a word-wide pandemic killing millions of people on earth and you get a exciting new version of of the classic fairy tale filled with unexpected twists and intrigue. My only complaint--the cliffhanger ending. What good is Cinderella if the story ends just after she loses her shoe fleeing from the ball? Still, that one minor complaint wasn't enough to keep me from giving this a well-deserved five stars.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina did a wonderful job with this album.  Back to Basics was great from top to bottom.  This was my second time buying the album because someone stole my first one.
B00006L3IE|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of early music. He over uses the bells on the Leonin, and I suppose some scholars would object to some of the performance practices, but generally, he makes a very good case for this wonderful music. Much of it sounds amazingly contemporary, especially the Perotin. The Machaut works are especially interesting.

Why can't they go back to sounding like \\"KORN\\", \\"Life is peachy\\", \\"Follow the leader\\", and \\"Issues\\" did? I know once \\"HEAD\\" left their sound changed. But if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Take a lesson from Slayer. They sound the same and are still considered a really great band. I'm done with KORN.

B003L0T5R0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Sinatra albums. There is a wonderful chemistry between Sinatra and Jobim, and the differences between the two artists seems blend into something magical. There is also a somber mood to the album that really seems to hit the note on many of the songs.
0307968774|4.0|Fresh off  her heart breaking escape from Lena's love lobotomizing society, she discovers the freedoms of the Wilds. And all the chores that come with them. Turns out she was pretty pampered in the enclosed cured community. Life on the outside is hard, hard work, little food, and lots of casualties.<br /><br />But as the resistance is rising, the cured have renewed their efforts in eliminating the invalids, forcing Lena and her new friends to re-assimilate into the Manhattan colony. Lena soon finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy and finding love in the most unlikely places.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's Pandemonium is an eloquently written mess of thoughts and details strung together to form a coherent character and world in a very unique way. I think the sequel exceeds Delirium in story and structure. I always felt the eradication of love as a main motivator a little flimsy, and it was the linchpin that held everything together in the first book. In Pandemonium the story focuses less on the cure, in favor of a more active plot line. Plus Oliver needed less time working on world building and character establishment so she could focus on a more complex plot without sacrificing the romance and lyrical flow of her writing fans of the series love. Some of the pacing in the beginning was slow, but it gained momentum as Lena grew stronger. A few lingering questions were answered, but with them came more inquiries that are sure to bring readers back for the next installment.<br /><br />Sarah Drew's performance of Pandemonium was good. Her portrayal of Lena was nice, maybe a bit dramatic at times, but she really knows how to capture the angst of teenage melodrama. I think her choices in voicing Julian was better than how she speaks for Alex, but overall she does a fine job with the series.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Taking on a topic that is all too common in this country, is extremely exciting. This novel by my favorite was a nail-biter to the end.  Wish he would write more often and then I wouldn't have to wait so long for a GREAT NOVEL!!!!!  Thanks John.
B007BDK3SS|2.0|The realistic graphics save it from one-start-hell, but difficult controls ruin the game. I found the tilt option completely unresponsive on my Samsung Charge.

1400052173|1.0|Although the history of the medical issues and challenges regarding this topic were interesting, this book went on ad nauseum about it.  The author takes non-fiction work and attempts to weave a novel-like approach to her writing.  It was tedious to read.  If some of the nonessential details had been left out, it may have been a more tolerable read.  I did not need such an endless trail of medical opinions, jargon, investigation, and analysis to get the point.  The history of the Lacks family was thoroughly detailed as well, again to the point of overkill.  This book could have been condensed dramatically and would have made a more profound impact on me.

0393338959|5.0|Joseph Stiglitz has made the transition from being at the centre of one of the main institutions of the Washington Consensus, to a principled opponent of these very same institutions, and the current \\"free\\" market orthodoxy which still tenaciously holds it grip on economic thinking at the global and national level.  In \\"Freefall\\" he looks at the current economic debacle, how it happened, its origins, the inadequate response, as well as speculating on what might get us out of this awful mess.  His focus is almost wholly on the US experience with only occasional sideway glances at events in Europe and across the globe.<br /><br />The narrative of the events, and processes, that led to the credit crunch are put before the reader in a concise and comprehensive manner, including the variety of complex financial innovations that contributed to the crash.  Stiglitz then looks at the Bush and the Obama administrations, he is fairly scathing about the latter, in particular regarding his economic team, almost all of them have played a part in getting the US economy into its current state.  Unsurprisingly he finds their responses to be inadequate, and primarily focused at preserving financial institutions that have failed, and a policy environment that has failed, at the expense of the majority of the US population (he calls the bank rescue program \\"The Great American Robbery\\").  Stiglitz appears to favour some sort of bankruptcy proceeding for banks, as well as legislating for a return to the separation of commercial banks from investment banks, amongst other measures.<br /><br />Next Stiglitz looks at the mortgage industry, particularly the sub-prime segment of it.  The details of the practice of this industry in the US (and even in the UK where 42% of mortgages applications are apparently still self-certified) is enough to make the jaw drop of even the most cynical of readers.  This is followed with a more general appraisal of Americas position with rising public debt, it'srelationship with China, and a still dysfunctional financial sector.<br /><br />One of the more interesting chapters is Stiglitz look at the rise and failure of the free-market economics: one still awaits its fall or it being reduced to its proper place.  Issues highlighted include persistent failure to deal with reality as opposed to the asinine assumptions it makes regarding it, the poor record it has regarding growth, and its failure to improve the circumstances of the American population (US GDP grew by 10% between 2000 and 2008, median household income fell by 4%!).  The final chapter \\"Towards a New Society\\" steps back from the crisis and looks at how we can begin to move towards a society that works for the majority of the population, rather than one run in the interests of the few.<br /><br />A stimulating read, that packs a surprising amount of narrative, analysis and thinking into 300 pages.  One shortcoming is that despite being fully referenced the book omits an index.  I assume this will be rectified when \\"Freefall\\" is published in paperback?  A book that I would have no problems recommending to anyone interested in how the economic crisis came about, the resulting response, it's roots, as well as some more fundamental thinking on the whole debacle.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Having never been very good at playing these types of games,  I thought I'd give it a try.  Low and behold, I STILL suck at these games.  Despite that, I still have loads of fun playing this game.  It's just so much fun watching my poor biker  trying to get over that white van and dying every single time (skull &amp; crossbones asking to continue...sweet!).  I'll keep trying to get him over that van and I'm sure he'll keep dying.  Thank you for the awesome FAotD Amazon!!!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I dont know whats wrong with most of you who gave this a poor rating. Do you really have any idea about what a good movie is? This is like that video game Driver brought to life. Sure there wasn't to much action but everything fit perfectly well into this movie. Those of you who prefer something like the fast and the furious have no taste whatsoever. I would rather watch this with actual stunts being performed in cars than that green screen fake action you see in movies like the fast and furious. Overall good movie with good performances and great music. Not for the younger audience (they wouldn't get it).
0312641893|4.0|When I got the advanced reader copy for Cinder, by Marissa Meyer, my sixteen year old daughter snatched it away from me. I think that is a good example about how this book is received by its target audience.  I am older, have read more widely and am a great deal more cynical, but I still liked this book very much.<br /><br />Cinder is a retelling of Cinderella set in the future in the city of New Bejing. Cinder has all the requisite baggage--a wicked stepmother, two stepsisters, a prince, and a father-figure who died and left her to the mercy of her stepmother. She is also a cyborg--part human-part machine for the uninitiated.  Cyborgs do not have the full rights of those who are completely human.<br /><br />Given the nature of fairy tale reimaginings, the basic story line is already set in stone. This means some of the plot turns were less than surprising, but I think that anyone reading a book like Cinder already understands that. Her entrance to the ball was unfortunately similar to the entrance that another young princess made in a movie (and in the book, I believe, but I cannot remember). I am not saying any more for fear of spoilers, but if you read the book, you will probably know what I mean.  Even so, the plot is imaginative and fresh and, while reading, I really wanted Cinder and her Prince to triumph over evil. It is Book 1 in the Lunar Chronicles and I will definitely be reading Book 2.<br />Posted by TracyStoller at 2:55 PM
0062112430|5.0|Delirium takes place in the future of Portland, Maine after much of the country fell victim to an apocalypse of sorts caused by amor deliria nervosa, more commonly known as love. We meet Lena, many years after a cure has been developed and widely used, just as she is about to take her evaluations before receiving the cure. Lena is terrified of everything. Of her own skin. Of her own actions. Of the delirium. Of taking one toe-step out of line. Then she meets Alex. He's lean, muscular, and super sexy but he's cured so there's no risk, right? Wrong. Lena falls in love and over the course of 400+ pages a lot of secrets are revealed about this society and government Lena once thought was protective.<br /><br />Gosh, what is there to say about Delirium that hasn't already been said? Nothing. I'm a year late on reading this and probably the last in line. But I fell hard for Delirium.<br /><br />I need to start off by saying how absolutely stunning the writing is that Oliver presents. I mean wow. The metaphors were perfectly placed, timed and well-thought out. I'm a sucker for inventive metaphors but it's the use of them that makes it a useful literary device. Delirium, besides the metaphors and such, read almost like poetry. It ebbed and flowed in such a natural and organic way that it's hard to believe Lauren Oliver wrote and typed with her fingers and mind as opposed to straight from her heart onto page. I have so much to say about the writing and nothing at all.<br /><br />The story captivated me from the word go, both for the plot line and Lena herself. I see so much of myself in her that it's downright terrifying. Scared to take risks, wishing for things that will never be (mother, etc.), afraid to do much of anything yet willing to risk everything. Every time she went to break curfew and go to the dance parties Hana attended, I kept screaming (internally, mind you) that she should turn around and go home, much like my insides were screaming the same thing when I went to first meet Danny. But you have to take risks cause life isn't worth living otherwise. But I digress.<br /><br />The concept that love as the reason society failed is pioneer. This is Oliver's true genius. It's the reason we would never see coming. Sure, wars and bombs and such could easily lead to the dystopian societies so commonly found in the YA novels we read. But an emotion such a love? At first, I scoffed at the idea and couldn't really imagine it working given the genre. But it made absolute sense. Love, or the loss of such, is a common reason for suicides. The prevalence of depression medications (that are still being developed even with the 1000s that are out there) are perpetuated by love and love loss (familial, romantic, etc.). Wars are fought for the love of one's country, one's religion. Love, which is the happiest concept of all is the most saddening and it just adds up.<br /><br />The story was invigorating. My heart pounded (both in anxiety and excitement) for pages and pages. The secrets - Alex's past, the governmental faults, Lena's past, present and future, etc. - were slowly doled out that kept the pace steady and comfortable. The romanticism between Lena and Alex evolved just as one would expect in real life - trust growing slowly, feelings creeping in, then bam! In love. Sounds sorta like insta-love but I would swear by this that that is not the case.<br /><br />I don't even think I made it through the last chapter before I ordered Pandemonium, book two. I knew in my heart of hearts that it would end as it did but didn't come to grips with it till I got through the end. Okay, the truth is, I didn't come to grips with it until I wiped the wet makeup off all corners of my face and reread those last heart-wrenching pages again. If for no other reason presented here, get ahold of this book for those last pages - there is no better than feeling that much.<br /><br />Overall, I loved, loved, loved this. There, I said the dreaded L word. You best believe if society crumbles for real like this, I'd take being an Invalid any and everyday of the week. Bring on book two!<br />flag<br /><br />5 / 5 stars
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I started watching this show at the start of season two, not knowing much about it. From the season premiere on, I was hooked and decided I had to see the first season. It definitely packs a wallop! I watched all 6 episodes in one sitting, not able to pry my eyes from the screen. The DVD includes various extras including \\"making of\\" vignettes, cast interviews, inside stories on certain zombies & characters, trailers, etc....well worth the $15 price tag for the 2-disc set. I'm anxious for season two on DVD! If you haven't seen this show, I recommend you start watching it. Now.
B005FITILO|4.0|Charlize Theron plays the character of Mavis as if she was taken from a bad Katherine Heigl Rom-Com and thrust into the real world.  Jason Reitrman and Diablo Cody have crafted a film that deceives the viewer by challenging film conventions, and that's a compliment.<br /><br />Theron's character travels back to her hometown in hopes of hooking up with an old flame, Buddy.  Throughout the entire film, she is self absorbed, and delusional as if this is meant to be.  What makes the film compelling is that if this was any other film, her character would either wind up with the guy or learn some lesson and wind up with an equally handsome great guy.  Yet, as in all of Reitman's work, Mavis is incredibly flawed and a happy ending isn't easily achieved.  What happen's is surprising and the ending isn't neccessarily fullfilling depending on how you view it.  Personally, I think it's fitting.<br /><br />While Theron is impressive, Patton Oswalt is equally good as a voice of reason for Mavis.  He plays one of her former classmates who was clearly unpopular and not even a footnote in Mavis's life, despite having a locker next to her.  Like Mavis, he's still somewhat trapped in the past, though for entirely different, shocking reasons.  The Reitman/Cody character study culminates in a great scene between Theron and Oswalt that almost literally strips the characters of any pretense, displaying both at their most vulnerable.<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone, and people seem to love it or hate it.  It has some light touches of comedy but by most counts, it's very clearly a drama.  Like all of Reitman's films, I wanted to pick this one up again and rewatch it.  Do not, however, expect a feel good movie.
0553381695|5.0|A Clash of Kings, Book 2 of A Song of Ice and Fire    You simply can not get away from Game of Thrones at the minute.    There are ads on tv and clips when your browsing the Internet, magazine interviews and Sky seem to keep reminding us that it starts on the 1st of April in between every spare bit of time they have.    We get it Sky. Game of Thrones has the series link set to record on my set top box!!    With the not-so-subtle propaganda dealt with, I just want to say I am turning into quite the fanboy of Game of Thrones. I have successfully stayed away from spoilers and after watching the first series then reading the first book I wished to do it the other way about this time.    Taking straight from where we left off in the first book, main characters have carried on their individualistic journeys which all seem to be connected to one another in a wider sense.    The background to the book is that the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms appears to be up for grabs. King Robert is dead and rumour has it that his son, the young King Joffery, is not the legitimate heir and so many now claim the throne.    Rob Stark is one of those kings, however, his main aim is to avenge the murder of his father Eddard Stark.    Rob's brothers and sisters are spread throughout the kingdom and more or less are trying to survive during this time of turmoil.    There does not seem to be a structure to this story, which makes it more interesting than the last. You dont know what will happen from chapter to chapter.    George R R Martin paints scenes beautifully, I can not express how important the little things are which can make you become lost in a book such as smells, architecture of buildings, describing ordinary non characters, clothing and even things like a character eating, sleeping and relieving themselves.    Yes, this may sound a bit odd but Martin gets these little things right every time and when he does that, you trust him with the important scenes like battle sequences, which are simply, immense. I found myself wincing during the hand to hand combat fighting and willing some characters on.    One of my favourite scenes was an important escape of a main character during the depths of a battle in the middle of night. Elements such as fire, water and the dirt on the ground was described perfectly. A full blown movie was going on in my head.    Martin has chosen to tell his story through lowly characters. A stroke of genus. While others may have chose kings and queens, Martin has chosen children, disabled folk and bastards to carry this tale.    The Good: I have never read large epics at such a fast pace. Be sure to delegate time to read these books as your other half may get miffed off that your spending too much time with your nose buried I this book/kindle! Clash of Kings is darker and more bloodier than the last book.    The bad: Some parts of the book could have been condensed, for example, Daenerys Targaryen, who is trying to come to grips with her husbands passing and her inheritance of 3 actual dragons takes an age of endless traveling and soul searching.    Summary: I apologised when I reviewed the first book, A Game of Thrones, as I sounded like a \\"gushing reviewer\\", however I make no apologises now. This book is a fantastic epic and wonderfully written. I give it a 5/5    Review from my blog:  [...]

1455510319|1.0|After trying, and trying, to finish this piece of tedium, I finally gave up half-way through. If Connelly's editor had been doing his/her job, this book would've been about 100 pages, but dull in even that abbreviated version. The amount of courtroom detail that NO ONE CARES ABOUT filled his chapters and brought what little suspense existed to a halt.<br /><br />I'm usally a Connelly fan. And, I'm hoping for better in the future.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I got the watch to start some serious running. My friend has an older version and uses it quite often.  I like the capabilities and for the most part, it works very well.  My only complaint is that the watch will sometimes lock up or freeze before use.  I need to recharge the watch to get it to reset.  I also learned to lock the bezel when carrying the watch in a bag.  This will preserve the battery.  Overall, a good purchase!

0312323867|3.0|The problem with reading Something Blue was that I bought it after succumbing to the hype. The review which I found the most scintillating regarding this book was how well she portrayed bona fide diva and \\"bitchy girl\\" narcissist, Darcy Rhone. I was immediately hooked upon reading that review, because what I love most is a strong tale of redemption and individuation. To my bitter disappointment, however, it was the typical rich-and-beautiful-girl ending (only acceptable because avoiding clichés became such a cliché on its own, that Griffin's ending sufficed). Let me elaborate...<br /><br />First off, I don't find Griffin's portrayal of Darcy too convincing. There are authors who can pull it off, and there are authors who just sound like a middle school fanfiction writer. Griffin falls in the latter category. I understand that part of it is that Darcy starts out in that maturity level but I feel like even a puerile woman at the age of 30 and pregnant could have been depicted more genuinely. A lot of times, I feel like Griffin is actually ranting and asking questions she already knows the answer to, but is playing dumb just to make her ditzy character more authentic.<br /><br />Then there's the so-called redemption story, which I found to be neither redemptive nor even profound, just nice. Darcy finding love in the most \\"unexpected of places\\" was heartfelt, and even I was happy for her. However, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I was disappointed that Darcy in the end still had to find love in order to be herself, or to be happy. In the first half of the novel, Darcy undergoes her spiral down, and the way her world came crashing was momentous and poignant. In the end, Darcy did not really pick up after herself. She had to have her husband-to-be pick up after her and lay out all of her flaws for her. My next problem was how easily Darcy had done it. She basically wrote a list of areas she needed a personality-make-over on and changed in a span of weeks withoutfail.I don't know about you, but most people on the path of redemption usually have misgivings and wayward trails before they reach the ultimate goal, not a straight-forward, non-obstacle course. It was very anticlimactic, and the only satisfying part about her redemption was the reconciliation with ex-bestfriend Rachel. Where were the true areas of struggle? The most she had to struggle with was breaking off a stagnant relationship and not judging women on appearances, sprinkled with occasional bouts of abject self-pity in reflecting on her past.<br /><br />To top it off, it became the typical Barbie girl ending for Darcy.Finding true love is nice, but I feel that should be secondary to the actual process of self-autonomy and individuation. She needed to become a mother and then a wife to establish for herself a new persona, rather than becoming a Darcy Rhone who means more than the sum of her parts.<br />In the end, I had to appreciate Something Blue for what it really was: a thrilling housewife read. It was not at all intellectually dazzling or emotionally touching (and trust me when I say Griffin could've had me in the bag because I am basically Darcy incarnate), when I felt the book had much more potential than typical setting of rich-New-York-shopaholic-getting-her-priorities-straight story. I guess I shouldn't have believed reviews when they made this book more than it actually is: a nice leisurely read, nothing more, nothing less.

B0067Q04AM|5.0|Big, big props to Robert Glasper for this moving project.  The aptly titled cd blends the voices of many of Neo-soul's talents with Glasper's amazing jazz depth.  As a jazz vocalist (myself), I find it incredibly difficult to find musicians willing to share the improvisational stage in new ways in the jazz genre.  This project changes the game.  I am sooooo encouraged by this effort.  The project is sticky with the evolved soul textures of Ledisi,  Meshell N'degeocello, Music Soulchild, Erykah Badu and several other awesome talents.<br /><br />The biggest problem in music today is the pigeon-holing of every cd.  Radio stations seem afraid to risk playing a cd that includes colors of jazz, neo-soul, AND hip-hop.  If it doesn't only represent a singular genre it is somehow \\"confusing\\" or \\"unfocused.\\"  If you listen to most of the \\"jazz innovators\\" of the past they always found beautiful ways to fold other genre styles into their music (Miles Davis Doo-Bop for example).  Unfortunately, this is of the ONLY remaining ways to revive any new jazz music on the radio.  Most \\"jazz\\" stations play dusty, old, antiquated, historical selections.  Many would think there are NO new jazz influenced artists in America.  Truth be told, they all have to play in other countries in order to make livable wages in the jazz genre anymore...SAD!!!<br /><br />Bottom line, please support this VERY talented artist.  The project has beautiful examples that display how jazz, soul, neo-soul, and hip-hop intersect!!!  Hope future projects will include the likes of Amel Larrieux, Rahsaan Patterson, Jill Scott and Angie Stone would be nice :-)
B005NF2UE6|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic CD!  I think it's the best Nickelback CD of them all.  Everyone I know loves it. All of the songs are typical Nickelback, with some more ballad type songs, and some rougher, again typical Nickelback songs.  It's pretty much the only CD I've been playing in my car since I bought it last fall.  Love starting my day out with them.
031603438X|5.0|Having grown up with the Stones, Beatles, Kinks, Cream, Led Zepplin, etc. Amazing how so many of the old rockers knew each other and grew up together! Rumors over the years were not all true and what an incredibly facinating life Keith Richards has had! Enjoyed every word and his personal story really did bring back a lot of memories to me from the great days of Rock & Roll!
0439813786|3.0|The scene opens in 1931, Paris, the moon shining down over the city. Hugo Cabret leads a reclusive life of thieving and clockwork, keeping the clocks of the train station where he lives operating as normal. He's alone, living in an apartment in the walls of the station after his uncle has disappeared. Hugo was working as his apprentice after becoming orphaned, now he continues to make his uncle's rounds, collecting paychecks he cannot cash and hoping no one notices anything amiss. He knows if he's caught, he'll be sent to an orphanage, and Hugo cannot let that happen because he has a secret. Hidden away, Hugo has salvaged an automaton and is attempting to fix it using sketches and notations left in his father's notebook. The automaton sits at a desk, pen in hand, and Hugo is certain that if he can get it to work the automaton will have a message for him. In order to fix it, Hugo needs parts, and his resource for them is the mechanical toy shop run by an old man in the station. Unfortunately for Hugo, the old man catches him stealing, and takes from Hugo his father's notebook. Hugo must employ the mercies of the man's young ward, Isabelle, to help him recover his possession and finish his work on the automaton. What will the message from his father be, and why does the old man in the toy shop seem so haunted by Hugo's notebook?<br /><br />I'll admit that, as often happens, this book more-or-less flew below my radar until I saw that Martin Scorcese was adapting it to film. My interest was perked, and when I finally saw the trailer for Hugo, I knew I had to read it before I saw the film.<br /><br />Now, I'm one of those people who only goes to see a movie in the theater a couple of times a year, and waits for the majority of films on DVD before I watch. Also...I hate 3D. Seriously people, can we get over this trend? It's terrible. Very rarely do I feel that 3D enhances a film (as in the case of Avatar that would have been unwatchable without it), and most often it just annoys me to see shots that are intentionally constructed for that 3D wow moment with no regard to the story, and less for the non-3D viewer. I find it hard to believe that 3D television sets will ever become the household norm, and quite frankly for those of us who wear glasses, it is annoying and uncomfortable to be expected to put 3D glasses over our own and enjoy something in total discomfort /end rant. What I am saying here is, I know this movie came out in November, but I still haven't seen it, and am quite looking forward to it (without 3D glasses that is). I cannot help but question how my knowledge that the book would be made into a movie affected my enjoyment level of a book about movies.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret was a novel in a format I have not previously read, where the bulk of the book is told in pictures, and the words are relatively few (so much so, that I was shocked to see that this is even available as an audiobook...how does that work?). This makes The Invention of Hugo Cabret an incredibly fast read, despite its bulk, and I sincerely hope its girth does not frighten away potential readers. It is a touching story based in part on the life and work of early silent filmmaker, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. It is the marriage of story and format that make this book work, the pictures moving the story along the same as a silent film, giving readers a touch of the wonder and experience that was felt by early viewers--a wonder that is nearly impossible to capture in an age where we have all grown up seeing images on screen. As Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s was able to look at the format of film and see a world of opportunity to enchant and make dreams come to life, Brian Selznick was able to replicate imagination in a format of his own.<br /><br />The format does have its drawbacks, however, namely its ability to develop the characters. Hugo appears to be a character that is easy to care about, as many others in the story seem to take tohim immediately, but I found it hard to get invested myself. He, Isabelle, and the others seemed to lack a certain depth that is needed to build attachment. I am not saying that characters always need to be likable from the reader's perspective, but they should be able to arouse some emotions so that we are more drawn into the story. The Invention of Hugo Cabret lacked this, but I cannot help but remain hopeful that this is remedied in the film version. The trailer for Scorcese's film makes the story look magical. It appears to be a story about adventure, friendship, and love. While this was a decent read, certainly worth the short time it takes, I find myself shocked to say that I expect to like the movie better.found it hard to get invested myself.

B006GECE9Y|5.0|This is a much better browser than the ones I have built into my android RAZR and the Nook Tablet that someone gave me for Christmas. The main thing that bothered me about the built in browser was the apparent lack of ability to store bookmarks in folders. If you use bookmarks they can soon accumulate into a long, disorganized list. That negates the purpose of bookmarks.<br /><br />In the Dolphin Browser you can make folders for the bookmarks. I found it a little difficult to figure out how to do it, but trust me, it does. The trick is this: Once you get your bookmarks showing on the side bar (by simply sliding the left edge toward the right), you cannot add folders to the list as in Windows. Click Quick Access/Bookmarks. Once you are in this view you click the menu on your device (not the one in the app) and it will have choices to \\"Add bookmark\\" and \\"New Folder\\". The rest is easy.<br /><br />As a bonus, the browser is very fast, as claimed in the description. Whether it is faster than the built-in browser is debatable. On the RAZR's 4G network both browsers run lightening fast. On WIFI, the Nook also seems to run equally well with both.<br /><br />I found it difficult to activate the app's account with my email. At first I thought this was because I have several devices and I don't receive my email notifications anywhere but on the desktop. I tried clicking the \\"Activate\\" button when the notification came in on my desktop, but the devices still said that the account was not activated. I tried signing up with a different email but that didn't help either. I finally gave up on activating the account because it seemed to work okay without it. That was yesterday. Today I tried one last time to click the \\"Activate\\" button on the email and this time it said I had successfully activated it. Now everything works. I have a feeling that somewhere there is a human being causing a lag in the activation, so if you get this program give it a day or two to activate.<br /><br />The other nice thing is that this program is available on the Nook as well as the regular androids. When you buy a Nook Tablet you can install only the apps that Barnes and Noble sells you (this one was one of the few that is free, however). If you want apps that run on multiple android platforms, be careful about buying a Nook because your choices are very, very limited. I am delighted that this app could be had for both devices. I read somewhere that you can't get Dolphin for the Kindle Fire, but I'm not sure I believe this since I obviously got my android version on the amazon market.
0312641893|5.0|Cinder has spent her years since becoming a cyborg (and an orphan, and a second-rate citizen) laboring to provide for her overbearing stepmother and stepsisters. Her stepmother never wanted to accept Cinder into their home; she feels Cinder is to blame for her husband's exposure to the plague that caused his death, and only keeps her around as a source of income. Cinder is, after all, the most talented mechanic in all of New Beijing. While working, Cinder finds herself approached by an `inconspicuous' Prince Kai, asking her to fix an outdated android that holds some important information. She's happy to be of assistance, but helping the Prince becomes increasingly difficult when her younger stepsister, Peony, is infected with the plague and her stepmother opts to volunteer Cinder for treatment research.<br /><br />\\"The cyborg draft had been started by some royal research team a year ago. Every morning, a new ID number was drawn from the pool of so many thousand cyborgs who resided in the Eastern Commonwealth. Subjects had been carted in from provinces as far-reaching as Mumbai and Singapore to act as guinea pigs for the antidote testing. It was made out to be some sort of honor, giving your life for the good of humanity, but it was really just a reminder that cyborgs were not like everyone else. Many of them had been given a second chance at life by the generous hand of scientists and therefore owed their very existence to those who had created them. They were lucky to have lived this long, many thought. It's only right that they should be the first to give up their lives in search for the cure.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit that Cinder was so much more than I was expecting. I feel books rarely live up to their hype, and to me, Cinder was one of the most hyped up YA titles of the new year. So I lowered my expectations, but I have to say, for me this one totally lived up to the hype. Cinder had all of the elements of a great retelling. It was true to the structure of the well-known Cinderella, but managed to completely reimagine the details flowing into that structure to support it, and to do so in a way that was completely unique.<br /><br />Cinder lives in a future after WWIV, where the world has divided into large territories whose leaders work together regularly. The moon, colonized hundreds of years previously, has become Earth's biggest threat where Queen Levana sits the throne as a powerful and manipulative dictator hungering for more. Prince Kai must deal with dangerous negotiations to maintain peace, while at the same time desperately searching for a cure for the plague, lumotosis, that has ravaged the Earth for around fifteen years.<br /><br />Cinder made an excellent example of the issue of prejudice. Cinder finds herself the victim of being considered less than human because of her cyborg status. She struggles to be accepted into society, insistent on her humanity, while at the same time harboring incredible prejudice against Lunars (those people who inhabit the moon).<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed the treatment of emotions in Cinder. This was not an overly emotional book. There's no pining, no insta-love, but still the characters come across as very real. I wish more books out there would realize you don't have to be melodramatic to be genuine! Prince Kai is very kind and down to earth, yet very aware of his duties and sense of responsibility to his people even (or especially) with the trying reality of plague in his own family. Cinder is, quite frankly, the coolest mechanic since Kaylee of Firefly. She's a tough chick who has to wade through pools of crap, but doesn't sit around moping or even sharing her hardships with those around her. This definitely can be a fault when it comes to her friendship with Kai, but I still respect the girl for it. And the bad guys? Man...they are evil! You get not only your evil stepmother but also your evil queen, and both have my all encompassing hate in the best way possible.<br /><br />Cinder's `major twist' was predictable, but in a way that I appreciated. I don't feel as if readers were written down to in this case, we're supposed to get it, and for once I wasn't banging my head against the wall wondering when the characters were going to figure it out already. I did have a slight problem with some of the dialog. It occasionally felt a little off-kilter given the setting, but this was fairly minor. Finally, some of the sci-fi aspects of the book seemed to be dipping over into fantasy a bit. As the story states, it is not magic, but the explanation still seemed a bit fanciful to me. This aspect didn't reduce my enjoyment though. Overall, I loved this book, and it's certainly one of my favorites of 2012 thus far.<br /><br />Cinder's `major twist' was predictable, but in a way that I appreciated.

0525423656|4.0|Cassia's time at the work camps is almost up, and she'll soon be sent to Central, the biggest city in the Society, for her final work assignment. She came here with the hopes of getting closer to Ky, of finding him. So far, she's managed to keep the stock of blue pills from Xander and Ky's compass secret and safe, but if she's going to go she needs to go now. When the morning to be moved arrives, Officers come to collect selected Aberrations and take them away. Cassia decides to sneak into the group as this might be her only chance to get to the Outer Provinces.<br /><br />Ky has been sent to die. The Society seems to be killing off its Aberrations as they are sent to live in abandoned border villages of the Outer Provinces. Nearly every night there's fire, and the boys in the villages have been given nothing but blank ammunition with which to defend themselves. They're told if they complete a mission of six months they'll be welcomed back to Society as full Citizens. The boys figure out pretty quickly that nobody has ever lived that long, and Ky's already been there longer than most. If he's going to live to see Cassia again, he has to get out now. Luckily, they have just been stationed in a land that is familiar to him. When he was a child he called this place home, and with the Carving in sight Ky knows there is a chance to reach land the Society won't easily enter, and even possibly find help among the Farmers who live there.<br /><br />Like it's predecessor, Matched, Crossed is written with the voice of a poet. Ally Condie's writing is lyrical, enchanting, and it reads with the feeling of a very long and beautiful love letter. Part of the reason I loved Matched so much was its quiet sense of danger and urgency always lurking just below the surface. Everything about Matched was so careful. The entire book was spent dancing on egg shells, and so much was said in small actions, stolen moments, erasable words. Crossed maintains the underlying feeling of the story, but kindles it with something new. Unlike the first installment of the series, which was narrated in first person by Cassia alone, Crossed is narrated in first person perspectives alternating between Cassia and Ky. It is so heartwarming/heartwrenching to see things from Ky's perspective. We are able to see his love of Cassia through his own eyes, learn more of his story, and reread portions we already knew from his perspective. I did occasionally have an issue where I would get a page or so into the chapter and realize I wasn't sure whose chapter I was on, their voices were so similar. However this wasn't an overarching problem (and probably a personal one created by my attempting to pay attention to football while reading).<br /><br />While Crossed shares a voice with Matched, the tone and setting couldn't be more different. Taking place largely in the wilderness of the Carving (inspired by Utah, where Ally Condie lives), Crossed becomes less about emotional survival and more about physical survival. Cassia is a Society girl, with all the naivety that comes with that, and Ky is facing some demons being so near his past. Cassia has found a new hope, and unfortunately, it's the one thing Ky isn't sure he's willing to give her. Besides which, there's the question of Xander--he's still her Match, her best friend, and someone she loves dearly. Not only that, there's a secret Xander has yet to tell Cassia, and Ky is pretty sure he knows what it is...and that if she learns it, she might choose him instead.but kindles it with something new.

B0046ECFRM|4.0|Anna's father, who seems to basically be Nickolas Sparks, decides to ship her off to boarding school in Paris for her senior year to get herself some culture. She doesn't want to go, and is bitter at her lack of choice, but she finds herself not entirely hating the place once she makes some new friends--particularly Etienne St. Claire. St. Claire is American born, English raised, and French sired. And if you don't find that hot, well I don't know what's wrong with you. Too bad he's taken; not only does he have a girlfriend, but her new friend Meredith's totally in love with him. Besides, Anna still has feelings about Toph from back home, right? Ha! Prepare for a year of awkward.<br /><br />Let's take a moment to discuss the importance of choosing the right format. I initially picked up Anna and the French Kiss as an audiobook, and after suffering through 5 chapters I was ready to give up. I couldn't stand the narrator, Kim Mai Guest. To me, the narration came across as very whiney, snobby, made the whole story seem very vapid, and I did not want to hear it. Needless to say, I won't be listening to other works like How I Live Now or Wildwood Dancing that are also narrated by Kim Mai Guest. Now, I do want to emphasize that this audiobook was recommended by multiple people, so don't let my bad experience make up your mind--just know that if you don't like it, you can always change formats! Since pretty much everyone loves this book, I decided I'd switch over to the Kindle edition and push through to see if I could like it better. This made all the difference!<br /><br />My judgements and emotions went back and forth a lot throughout this book. I love boarding school (living vicariously), but I hate Paris (maybe hate is extreme, but I don't like it). I loved St. Clair (awesome friend), but he was kind of an idiot (crappy boyfriend). Anna was annoyingly naive (come on, no one watches that much film and doesn't know `pissed' means drunk in Britain), but totally identifiable (more on this later). There were some teeth grinding cliches (like bending down to pick things up and bumping heads), but the story was very true to life and the crappy decisions many people make in relationships. In the end, I decided I really liked it, and appreciate Perkins's honesty and ability to wrangle uncomfortable situations into text in a way that made me scream \\"Why am I so awkward!?\\"<br /><br />So...since this is a romance, let's discuss the leads! I identified with Anna a lot, in ways that actually made me uncomfortable to remember some of the past decisions I made that hurt my personal relationships. She's a film buff, and wants to be a critic, which is awesome. She's totally awkward about her Americaness upon moving to Paris, which I can 100% identify with. I spent my junior year in Europe, and had similar feelings upon moving to New York. Being from Wyoming, my impression of NYC was largely formed watching episodes of Sex and the City. I was so nervous to even set foot in the city at first, as Anna was in Paris--filled with complete misconceptions and self-consciousness. Anna was also awesome in that she didn't turn into a bumbling idiot around the guys she liked. She was still her intelligent, funny, silly self.<br /><br />And then there's Etienne St. Claire. First the good: he's shorter than Anna (as a 6' tall woman, I love seeing this sort of thing), he's totally sweet, funny, and thoughtful, he goes out of his way to make sure Anna feels comfortable and explores Paris. Then...the bad: he's so needy that he continues to date his gf, even after he obviously has feelings for Anna because he's not 100% sure of her feelings, while at the same time actively working to keep any other guy from getting near Anna. He crosses all the lines. But then he totally calls Anna on her crap, and there's totally (at least) two people in this boat, so I guess I can't funnel all my angsty glares toward him. Also, yeah, he's going through some stuff, and I guess that can make people make stupid decisions. So I forgive the guy.<br /><br />In the end, I appreciated that this wasn't a fluffy happy love story, even though it was full of some great humor. There were a lot of very realistic bumps in the road, and I found myself thinking `oh thank goodness I'm not the only one who's been this stupid'.t can make people make stupid decisions.

B0020BUWX2|4.0|So for weeks I've been struggling with the notion of whether or not I was ever going to get a review written for If I Stay. I couldn't see a way to do it without making it somewhat personal, but then I read Rachel Hawkin's amazeballs review of The Fault in Our Stars and felt totally inspired (yo...honest to God tears/laughing at the end). I saw that sometimes when a book really hits home it's okay to internalize it and let people know how it really affected you, because that's what gives the book power.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I was ever going to read If I Stay. See, I knew it was about a girl who got in a horrible car accident with her family, and somehow got to determine whether she lived or not in the aftermath. Do you ever avoid books that hit too close to home because you either don't want those feelings dredged up again, or you don't want someone who hasn't been through that type of situation dictating how it feels? I do. On my twelfth birthday, my family got in a horrible car accident. And just like in If I Stay, that's what it was. An accident. We rolled our Suburban eight times down the middle of I90 in Montana at 85 miles per hour (yes, at the time, this was a legal speed). My brother and I emerged miraculously unscathed. Yeah, we were bruised, cut, and were picking glass out of our scalps for weeks, but nothing broken, nothing internally damaged. Our mother was killed. It sucked, it still sucks. I've never been able to have a real `happy' birthday since. And to have to think `we were lucky' because my brother and I were okay, and have people say `God has a plan for her, it was her time' still makes me so unbelievably angry I could punch babies. So I have a bit of a hard time reading books or watching movies about car accidents the way others have a hard time reading books about cancer.<br /><br />I think that the number one thing I grabbed onto in this book for stability was the reality of the situation as an accident. There was no drunk driver to blame it on, sometimes normal people under normal circumstances make a mistake that has very beyond normal consequences. Thank you Gayle Forman for recognizing that. Sometimes bad things happen. It isn't anybody's fault, they just do.<br /><br />Also, I had Mia to hold on to. I loved Mia, and I adored her family. She was a quiet, introverted, musically inclined teen who actually liked hanging out with her family. I grew up in a music loving family (both my parents are/were musicians, and my father owns the local music store) and I always loved hanging out with my family too. Mia was mature beyond her years, but still was faced with one of the most impossible decisions imaginable. The story cuts between what Mia is experiencing after the car accident and memories of her life before. Her love for her family, her experiences playing cello, her best friend, and Adam, the love of her life. If I Stay made me break down, and no book, not even Thirteen Reasons Why has made me do that in a very, very long time. It was refreshing, like cleaning up the soul a bit. It's important to remember that sometimes what comes next doesn't have to be answered.it on, sometimes normal people under normal circumstances make a mistake that has very beyond normal consequences.

073935650X|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for ages, but who gets `in the mood' to read a book about suicide? It's akin to how I've been meaning to rewatch Schindler's List since I first saw it quite young, but again...who gets in that mood?<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why begins when Clay comes home to find a package with his name on it. He's surprised to find it contains outdated audiotapes, numbered with what looks like blue nail polish. There's no return address, but as soon as he begins listening he knows who the tapes are from--Hannah. Hannah, who Clay had a crush on for several years. Hannah who he had made out with one night at a party where she lost it. Hannah who's no longer there...because two weeks ago, she killed herself. The tapes Clay receives tell the story of thirteen reasons why Hannah came to the decision she did.<br /><br />I thought that a book about tape recordings would best be ingested as an audiobook, and I stand by that. I'm glad I was listening at home though, because I'm not sure how I would have handled driving through this. It's no secret that I had a hard time with this book, who wouldn't? I've been where Hannah was, but was lucky enough to have the support that led me to a different decision. That said, I'm going to try to keep this review from getting overly personal because you don't all need to know my story. We all have our own stories, trust me, someone cares about yours.<br /><br />Clay is, to put it mildly, upset when he receives Hannah's tapes. He's grappling with feelings of anger, not understanding how she could have done what she did, not understanding what he did to deserve these tapes. He cared about Hannah, he'd been trying for years to find a way to connect with her, and he finally thought he had, but she pushed him away. Why? Both Clay and Hannah have/had reputations; Clay is known as the \\"nice guy\\", he's about to be valedictorian, he's responsible, and everyone likes him. Hannah has a very different reputation, and as Clay listens to her tapes, we see how it was formed.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why reflects how a snowball can form from actions, and consequences can add up to be much greater than the sum of those actions. I found myself sharing many of the feelings Clay was experiencing. I was mad at Hannah. Suicide, to me, seems incredibly selfish, and creating tapes to let people know that they are to blame for your decision? I'm not sure I can imagine anything more vindictive or horrible. Hannah says she wants people to think about their actions, to let them know how they affect others<br /><br />Waiting to find out why Clay was on the tapes (because he was so certain he didn't belong) was almost sickening. It reminded me of Elizabeth Miles's Fury, waiting to know what Chase did...<br /><br />We experience this story almost as a conversation between Hannah and Clay, each sharing their sides of the story and the people they involve. For Clay, many are revelations:<br /><br />\\"With every side of every tape, an old memory gets turned upside down. A reputation twists into someone I don't recognize.\\"<br /><br />As the tapes moved forward, I found my anger at Hannah dissipating, and a horrid understanding taking control. It stops feeling like she is blaming others for her situation, and is turning inward, blaming herself. Hannah became apathetic, she gave up on herself and wouldn't let anyone reach her. Worst of all--she knew it. She knew that she chose it, that she was alone because she wanted to be, but that doesn't make it right. Hannah shouldn't have gotten there, someone should have reached out sooner. Not that I'm blaming others for her choice, I'm not, but I do sincerely think that Hannah could have been reached.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why for me was a similar reading experience to that of Laurie Halse Anderson's Speak. Speak, to me, is a powerful book for those experiencing depression, whereas Thirteen Reasons Why might be more powerful for those seeing depression from theoutside.outside.

1596912855|4.0|I don't often read anything that could strait up be called \\"romance\\" because I do find it embarrassing. I'm not sure why. I mean, a lot of what I read is so focused on romantic plotlines that throwing in fantasy elements or calling it YA doesn't really change things. But Austenland was a real adult romance, and I loved it. It had the Colin-Firth-loving, BBC-watching, Jane-Austen-admiring girl in me squeeing and fist pumping at all the right moments.<br /><br />Jane Hayes has an unhealthy Mr. Darcy obsession. She knows it, her friends know it, heck, her great aunt knows it. She can't seem to have a happy and successful relationship when no real life man can possibly measure up to her fictional crush, Mr. Darcy. Now, who among us women can say we don't have a total crush on Mr. Darcy?! I certainly do. However, unlike Jane, my fictional crushes have not seeped into my real life...for the most part...<br /><br />When Jane's great aunt passes away, she is surprised to find her name in the will as the recipient of an all-expenses-paid, non-refundable trip to Pembrook Park in Britain. Jane determines to go, to face Mr. Darcy and say goodbye once and for all so that she can get over him and on with her life. Of course, Pembrook Park proves that immersion therapy is easier said than done. Jane finds herself trussed up in corset and empire waist dresses, feeling awkward and silly, and challenged to take seriously the other women who share her experience, and the men cast to woo them in Austenesque fashion.<br /><br />The existence of Pembrook Park was, sadly, completely believable to me. I can imagine wealthy women paying exorbitant amounts to be woven into the world of Jane Austen and courted by charming young men therein. But isn't this a wee bit like hiring prostitutes? Emotional prostitutes maybe, but prostitutes nonetheless. Ah well, to each their own. It's easy to root for Jane, because unlike other guests, she is in no financial situation to live out her fantasies repeatedly, and is looking for a bit of therapeutic resolve. I love love loved Mr. Nobley, and found his character more-or-less the perfect Mr. Darcy (was he the spitting image of Colin Firth in my head? You know it.). It's so charming to me how Jane despises him for his irritability thinking him nothing like Darcy, failing to acknowledge that Elizabeth Bennet felt the same way.<br /><br />All in all, Austenland was no more surprising than any romcom I've ever seen, but I still enjoyed it quite thoroughly. I appreciate that it wasn't all about romance, it was about Jane finding herself and learning the power she has over her own life. The writing was very whimsical and fun, and Austenesque in a nudge-nudge, wink-wink sort of way that had me smiling more often than not.atedly, and is looking for a bit of therapeutic resolve.

0756407125|5.0|Following the excellent book, The Name of the Wind, The Wise Man's Fear picks up in the inn the Kvothe tends in the present, telling his story to Chronicler and Bast. In his telling, he's still at the University. This novel was a 994-page behemoth, and I can honestly say I wish it was longer, because I don't want to have to wait for the next one, The Doors of Stone, expected in May of 2013.<br /><br />Just like the first novel in the Kingkiller Chronicles, I loved this book. I had heard negative things about the second half of the novel, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I really can't believe I doubted Rothfuss... I remember reading the blurb about the first book and learning that Kvothe eventually leaves the University. I was anxious about that, because I wanted to learn the inner workings of the school, and I thought he was going to leave early on. By the time I hit the halfway mark in The Wise Man's Fear, I was ready to move on from the school and learn more about the world Rothfuss created. Luckily, he was on a similar brainwave.<br /><br />For the first half of the novel, we follow similar characters that were in the last book: Kvothe, Denna, Wil and Sim, Fela, Ambrose, and a few others. We also get a host of new characters in the second half. The first part of the book is pretty similar in many ways to the last book, so I'm not going to bother reviewing it past saying that it was an enjoyable revamp of The Name of the Wind, with a few wonderful additions (including a man who LIVES in the library. I would love to live in a library...). There is also, of course, more music. Kvothe has made me want to pick up the lute more than once.<br /><br />The SECOND half of the book was amazing. I loved that Kvothe finally got out in the world, somewhere out of the Commonwealth. He visits many new places with fun and weird new customs.  Kvothe spends time in some strange places. I don't think it's a secret that he spends time with Felurian and leaves, and is literally the only person who doesn't go mad when he leaves her. He also learns a new language (or two) and learns a way of gesturing meaning/feelings, which I found interesting but not really necessary. He also picks up a bit of fighting technique that I really enjoyed learning about. Through his travels, he doesn't forget about his one true goal... learning about the Chandrian. By now, I'm also curious as to their back story, and am eagerly awaiting more knowledge about them from the third novel.<br /><br />I'm trying not to give too much away to those who plan to read the book, so I'll stop with the summary. I enjoyed The Wise Man's Fear possibly even more than The Name of the Wind. Because it took so long to get to the part where he left the University, it has a similar feel to it as the first novel. I can't promise you will like the second half, but I loved it. I'm hoping the third and final novel will include more travelling. These books definitely merit a rereading before The Doors of Stone come out.  Rothfuss has beautiful prose, and I found it hard to not write every other sentence down as something worth quoting. I will include two quotes that were irresistibly good:<br /><br />\\"It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matters of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing because. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.\\"<br /><br />\\"This is the nature of love. [...] To attempt to describe it will drive a woman mad. That is what keeps poets scribbling endlessly away. If one could pin it to the paper all complete, the others would lay down their pens. But it cannot be done.\\"<br /><br />\\"I played the song that hides in the center of me. That wordless music that moves through the secret places in my heart. I played it carefully, strumming it slow and low intothe dark stillness of the night. I would like to say it is a happy song, that it is sweet and bright, but it is not.\\"the dark stillness of the night. I would like to say it is a happy song, that it is sweet and bright, but it is not.\\"
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This \\"toy\\" gets near constant use in my home. We love it. We have yet to have a guest in our home who does not ask what it is, picks it up to try it, asks where we got it, then proceeds to \\"play\\" with it until we insist that dinner will no longer be on hold. It is not a toy. It engages the mind and body of anyone who picks it up. Great for developing dexterity and hand-eye coordination. A remarkable item that never gathers dust.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was with no small amount of trepidation that I bought the first book in the Wool series.  First was the name, how could I possibly like something that's been sheared?  Secondly was the content, a survival story that takes place in a silo.  The cost of the first book won me over, and I took a plunge into the underground universe of Wool<br /><br />What I didn't forsee was that because the environment was limited, it drew a focus on a character-driven plot.  When there's no sweeping distractions of panoramic vistas and mythical beasties, this sort of sensory deprivation leads the reader inward, allowing them to get to know the characters of Wool on a more intimate level than most novels.  The little idiosyncracies, the discovery and revelations of the characters are the engine in the Wool series, and it is in the microcosm of a silo that they're displayed best.  Hugh's writing style is concise and tight, it brings an edge to the story and a stark reality to the situations.  At no point was I thinking that such a place was impossible, or even improbable--the hallmark of great writing.<br /><br />It's been over a month since I've read the final installment, and I still remember all the characters, situations, background story, all this despite having read at least a dozen novels since.  I won't be forgetting this story any time soon, and neither will you.  Buy this book today.
B0000DH957|5.0|I knew that I wanted this CD so, the purchase was made.  The package arrived in great condition.  I have always liked shopping on Amazon and will be purchasing items in the future.  \\"Complete satisfaction\\" is the only phrase that I could use to describe the feeling I had when my purchased items had arrived.  Thanks to the people at Amazon for getting my cd's to me so quickly.  Keep up the good work.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I searched for awhile on amazon for a lcd arm like this. there seems to be a huge price range from 30 to several hundred dollars. most of the arms cheaper than this had a decent amount of dissatisfied reviews.i am not sure what you get if you  spend more than this but it seems to me that this is a sweet spot in the what you spend and what you get department.  this one does exactly what I want and has the coveted portrait mode that is pretty easy to switch to. no problems to report.

This game is not optimised for the Galaxy Tab. It plays okay, but the parts where you get your reward are pathetic in their slowness, especially when you see the performance of first person shooters and the like. Not polished on this platform, unlike Bejewelled 2.
B004H8GLXQ|2.0|I ordered this book through Amazon because of the large number of 4-5 star reviews.  Plus, the plot summary seemed interesting.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.<br /><br />I had two major problems with The Thirteenth Tale:  First, the entire book is \\"overwritten\\".  It's a bit over 400 pages and I couldn't help thinking it could easily have been written in 250 pages.  There is just too much fluff.  For example, the author dedicates 3 whole pages to describing how a woman accidently sewed an extra heel in a pair of socks.  To make matters worse, this had very little to do with the story.  It could have been described in a paragraph.  The second problem has to do with the ending.  I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't read the book, so I'll just say it was a very far-fetched, hard-to-believe ending.
B004US4K2C|4.0|This has to her the smoothest running launcher out there.  i don't like the Go store at all but this launcher will do what you need. It is very customizable. Loving it.

I will see this over and over because there is so much theatrics and showmanship TS puts out there for you.  It is by far a great investment.  If I HAD to mention anything negative ... here goes .. they didn't put the DVD on top .. nbd ..I took both the CD & DVD out of the case and I switched their locations in the case :-)
B000OZ28IS|5.0|Sort of a spy thriller but from a female and personal perspective. The setting is the 1970s but much is told in flashbacks to the second world war time period. I found it difficult to put this book down; it was a fascinating read and and illuminated me about an oft overlooked facet of the USA's decision to actively join the allied forces. Mr. Boyd's knack for infusing humor and the most basic level of candor in his stories is quite present throughout.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|Overall very nice and diverse compilation of some unreleased tracks spanning from the Frank era till her last year.  The tracks that stood out the most for me were: 1)her amazingly powerful \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow' cover....2)The original version of 'Valerie' with the Dap Kings, slower and funkier than the more famous version...and the final track of the CD, 'Singing A Song For You' the Donny Hathaway cover, will probably leave you in tears; of joy on how amazing she sang, and the grief of her early departure.
0345529057|5.0|I won't say much about the fantastic writing/storytelling in this series except the following:<br /><br />(1) It is definitely NOT for the kiddies (lots of brutality, strong/twisted sexual content, etc.), so be careful who you're buying it for if it's a gift.<br /><br />(2) Make sure you're prepared for the author's tough, unconventional approach to dealing with major characters, i.e., in many cases \\"there will be blood,\\" as they say (I won't say more b/c I hate spoilers, but I'm not ruining anything by telling you that this can be a very sad, grim series, and if that's not your cup of tea, steer clear; I almost stopped reading at one point myself, but I'm very glad I kept going).<br /><br />(3) This really is the fantasy event of this generation, not just another good series; Game of Thrones should stand tall with Lord of the Rings and the other classics, even among readers who normally don't give a lick about the fantasy genre or left it once they hit adulthood (for those of you who tend to turn your nose up at \\"low art\\" genres, let me assure you that Martin's writing is top-notch and quite poetic).<br /><br />As for this particular package, I can only say that I've had no problems with the binding, missing pages, etc. Sure, the paper quality and margin formatting aren't ideal, but I'm on the 4th book and haven't had anything fall apart, so I can't complain, especially at this great, great price. I don't want to play down the concerns that other reviewers have expressed with this set, but I get the feeling that they've either been addressed by the publisher by this point (I bought mine in Feb 2012), or they only occur sporadically. So I'm pretty sure you can buy with confidence; I'm certainly thrilled that I got one of the great fantasy book series of our time for so cheap. Also, at this price you're not really taking a risk in buying four books instead of just the first one, since you're much much more likely to become a fan of the series than set it down after Book 1.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|A great buy. Works perfectly with Garmin Connect. Sometimes, the watch seems to take an awfull long time to find the satelite signals, and a few times the signal has been a little off in the beginning of a run.

1451627289|1.0|Stephen King is a troublesome author for me.  Many of his books are just terrible.  However, every now and then he does something good, like The Stand or Misery.  11/22/63 started out as very interesting to me.  I love time travel and he paints a compelling picture of the 50's with the good and bad of that time.  However, he just can't help himself from making it more of a political statment than just a good read.  Fairly early in the book, his main character is in Texas in the late 50's and has found a group called the tea party who are excessively racist. Really?!??!!  I have the book on audio and stuck with the audio book through all but two hours, and could not go on.  If you are a conservative and want to feel insulted, disgusted, incredulous and just plain mad as hell, then go ahead and read this.  Spoiler alert!  The point of the book is time travel to go back and stop the assisination of Kennedy.  In one of his travels back the main character does that with strange butterfly effects on the rest of the world.  One was that those damn Republicans worked against civil rights, George Wallace becomes President and there is pretty much an apocalypse which can be laid at the feet of the right wingers.  It makes me tired.  I think Mr. King has pretty much lost all touch with reality.  He is old enough and smart enough to know that in fact it was the Democrats who worked tirelessly against civil rights legislation. He forgot to mention people like Robert Byrd, the revered Democratic leader and former KKK leader, who personally fillabustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for 14 hours.  He also forgot to mention anywhere in the book that it was the Republicans who got the historic civil rights legislation passed in spite of the Democratic opposition. And let's not forget that George Wallace, the extremely racist crazy bigot, was again a Democrat.  It's like Stephen has decided to try to rewrite history as he believes it should have been, with the left as the good guys and the conservatives again the racist angry stupid dangerous people.  His heroine ends up a Community Organizer.  Ah yes, he has set the world right making history conform to his personal politics.  I stopped 2 hours short of finishing the book, and will never ever pick up another Stephen King book.
B002HFP0QU|2.0|After watching a documentary on the Bee Gees on Biography, my husband and I were excited to get a collection of their music.  Unfortunately this particular item was not what we had hoped for. It had been remastered and the sound quality was poor.  There was a slight difference with how the songs were sung from the original which threw off my singing along.  If you want to hear great music from the Bee Gees, stick to the original tracks produced.
B0072X2NUS|5.0|Dorothy and/or Toto, I definitely believe we are no longer in D&eacute;mod&eacute; World, Yazoo Town, Assembly City, Erasureville, nor in The West India Company!<br /><br />Where Mr. Vincent John Martin, affectionetly known as Mr. Vince Clarke and Mr. Martin Lee Gore take us we don't need any other instruments or items, just take yourself and prepare for an out-of-body experience...Please don't forget your ears!<br /><br />Before I enter into my opinionated rant I would like to explain that I felt that each individual song needed to be critiqued on its own recognizance....So here goes!<br /><br />Lowly - A very nice and catchy tune to introduce the album, which gives it a feeling as if the listener is in for an adventure of adventures....I felt as if I was going to watch a sci-fi movie or a mixture of Indiana Jones meets Mission Impossible meets Tim Burton meets Stanley Kubrick in a Hip-Hop Techno World.<br /><br />Zaat - Second Song, Second Scene, Second Chapter. The song seems to want to be stuck in this repetitive mind-bending vortex until it kicks into second gear at the 1:30 mark and third gear at 2:00. I felt as if I was driving down a street in a rather large manual transmission car in mid-day traffic where the person goes from 1st gear, 2nd gear, 3rd gear and then stop to return to 1st gear and goes through the process again. Not until the 4:18 mark does the song go into a high gear clear road process and moves into the sunset.<br /><br />Spock - Picking up from where Zaat left off, I guess the sunset was not our next destination...Space - This song has a space feel as if the listener is traveling freely through a black hole where it's safe but at the same one doesn't know what is around the corner. I felt as if I was being treated to an introduction to space by none-other than Mr. Spock himself!<br /><br />Windup Robot - I suppose this is our tour guide in this adventure or at least our intermission concierge. This song takes on another direction with another feeling - A certain re-winding of a wind-up toy ready for the continuation of the adventure that so far has been an enjoyable one.<br /><br />Bendy Bass - Other than the obvious bending bass sound in the main beat - This is yet another room in the vast array of sounds that has been promised and kept by our musical geniuses. This musical interlude has a certain sound that feels whimsical but at the same time intriguing that leaves you with a want for more which at the end of the tune does leave the listener satisfied.<br /><br />Single Blip - If there was such a place that existed and disappeared just as fast as it appeared, this would be the soundtrack that one would probably overhear. This song was definitely created with one bleep or blip in mind and it grows into a menagerie of sound which ends with a single bleep or blip, just like it started.<br /><br />Skip This Track - DON'T SKIP THIS TRACK! This song is like falling asleep, as if you can in this array of sound, during the most important part of the movie. It's as if you just had a delicious six out of 10 course Italian meal and you decide to leave the restaurant...Surely one doesn't want to miss a single morsel of sound in this album.<br /><br />Aftermaths - Imagine, if you will, a Masterpiece - A Work of Art - A Best Seller - After everything is done there are pieces of musical wizardry that are left on the imaginary cutting-room-floor. These musical pieces are not bad musical pieces, they just don't fit in the realm of any of the seven previous master craftsmanship. These medieval guild articles are placed together and form yet another chef d'oeuvre.<br /><br />Recycle - A yet still these are pieces that don't quite fit...Don't throw anything away...Don't give up on master musical wizardry...Seek and one will definitely find as VCMG did throughout this musical story!<br /><br />Flux - Funny thing is that a Flux by definition is constant change and instable, a substance that promotes the fusion of two substances or surfaces - as in soldering or welding. It also is defined in the world of physics as the rate of flow across an area or the strength of a field, theory of change, quantity of movement. In this album the term/song is used as an all of the above. It shows how an album, just like a work of literature or an Oscar winning cinematic masterpiece, can and does have a beginning, a middle, and an end; with all it's parts fitting within each other pretty much perfectly.<br /><br />This classical work is a one-of-its-kind created by what could be considered two of the Masters of Electronic Synthetic Music.surfaces - as in soldering or welding.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I absolutely love this series, and watching it in 1080p makes it even better. The shows so beautiful, that it makes me wish DirecTV had more shows in 1080p instead of just the pay-per-view movies. At the original price I wasn't going to buy this as I had it saved on my DVR, but when it went down to 35 dollars I had to pick it up. I've read the books and already loved the story, so there's not much to complain about here as they stay relatively faithful. However, it is a little annoying to have awesome characters killed off, almost more so in a TV show as I wasn't used to losing main characters. Also, the whole Daenerys Targaryen storyline is so frustrating, it's hard to believe she's so gullible, but I understand it was done to move the plot line along. The acting, sets, and costume design are all superb in this show, it's hard to find anything wrong with it. I think the show should be watched by both people that like fantasy, and people that might not care for fantasy stories but love character drama. After watching it one more time in full HD, I can't wait for the start of the second season.
B0017OB12O|5.0|The film marked the time and watch it in high definition is a privilege. The blu-ray comes in a rigid box full of details in high relief, something valued by collectors. Moreover, it comes with a book which portrays the details of the film and print multiple cards that reproduce the time of release of the film, which is pretty cool. The box arrived in perfect condition and very well packed. It is worth, I recommend.
B004A8ZWWY|5.0|This movie is for adults for the swearing and sexual jokes, but it was pretty good.  It has plenty of funny moments as well as what's going to happen next on your edge of your seat moments.  I really liked it and definitely recommend it.  The acting was sub par, but it was a good movie all together.
B007JF87VS|5.0|I was beginning to worry that maybe this show was getting too far away from its source material, the 93 comic books, which are wonderful.  Like most tv shows or films, it cannot remain totally faithful to the source material but it is unwise to depart too far from something which worked so well in print.  I don't want to give anything away so let me say this: the comics are absolutely relentless on the death toll of living in this new world.  If the zombies don't kill you, your fellow survivors, or rival survivor clans, may do so. This episode picks up on that relentless death toll and marches us further ahead into the uncertain future for Rick and his son, Carl.  They are the two constant characters in the series as so many others fall in internal or external battles.<br /><br />On a side note, Darryl (crossbow), was not in the original comics.  However, I have really grown to like him and hope he lasts as one of the characters.  I suspect his brother, the one who cut off his hand, is further along in the plot. This brother was also absent from the comics.  Darryl has to remain alive at least until we meet up with him again. I suspect the brother will be leading one of these rival clans.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0066W1AZK|5.0|Wonderful free chess game! Basic but all you need to have fun. Thank you for putting this out there free.  Ive enjoyed it immensely
B001USHRCK|5.0|My six year old daughter loved this set!  She built it herself and she plays with it often. The details in this set are amazing!
B004I744AS|5.0|just downloaded. was very impressed by the front page with the fun games. hopefully the new words I learned today will stick! nice clean layout.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I love John Green, because not only does he write novels that attract young adults, but the themes that are shown in the books are much more in depth than a regular young adult novel. Superb.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a very good app. It is appropriate, open to public, and handy for using when you have a test coming up. I will recommend this app to everyone because it is useful and appropriate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game, and if u play everyday u get 5000 points for unlocking other games . it's a lot of fun
B0063IH60K|5.0|ive downloaded solitaire apps before and have quickly become crosseyed at the endless variations and then quickly uninstalled them due to sheer frustration. this is solitaire pure and simple. exactly what I wanted.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is a fun challenging puzzle game that is not impossible to figure the puzzles and once figured it's fun to do again to go for a faster time. If you like puzzle games this is a good one. ''
B007BDK3SS|4.0|I love it so much. Ps, I had the tilt control problem. just flip the kindle so the other side of the screen is up. may take a sec to notice tilt but works good once it is used more.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|awesome game - fun, easy and addicting.  you can get carried away watching the clock but the social aspects are fun.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|This was a really good concert; the sound and video were excellent and it goes in the player whenever things stink on TV (which is more and more these days...)  A great buy if you're a Rush'ian and if you aren't initiated yet, I suggest you prepare yourself - the guys are a bit off from a socially acceptable/cool perspective, but that is just part of the package with this monster group of musicians.  Fabulous (although a BR version of Rush in Rio would top this concert in a flash, $0.02 IMO...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the first blue-ray boxed set i bought with my new entertainment system. It does not disappoint.  You get it all; the colors of Coruscant at night pop out at you, everything is vivid and alive, the sound is spectacular.  You can almost feel the lightsabers coming your way.  The space battle scenes left my jaw hanging.  Blue-ray does Star Wars justice! I highly recommend this boxed set!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I originally bought this CD for SuperMassive Black hole by Muse (song from baseball scene) but I have been enjoying many of the other tracks from the movie as well.  It's nice to really hear Rob Pattinson's song that is in the background during the restaurant scene in the movie.  Twilight fans won't be disappointed.
0345522478|4.0|A good start to a so far very entertaining series. If you enjoyed reading about Harry Dresden in \\"The Dresden Files\\", then you will enjoy reading this. Looking forward to the next installment.
B004UQPM4E|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />First of all, I have the UK set.  I have been told that the audio/video quality is the same as the USA set.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the first Superman movie on Blu-Ray.  The picture just didn't seem that good.  I thought it looked like a lot of scenes were shot in bright light, in the fog (sort of fuzzy).  The scenes were just \\"soft\\", and not very detailed.  The remaining movies had better video quality than the first.  Video quality wasn't terribly disappointing - I mean I didn't feel totally ripped off like I have felt about some movies on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I believe the aspect ratio of all 5 movies is 2.35:1, or 2.4:1.  The bonus disc is 1.85:1, I believe, because it completely filled my widescreen TV.<br /><br />All 5 of the movies are DTS-HD Master Audio.  Superman 1, 2, and 3 are 5.1.  Superman 4, for some reason, is 2.0. The bonus disc is Dolby Digital 5.1.  Sound quality in the 5 movies is good overall.  When I was watching Superman 3, I was overwhelmed with strong sub-woofer bass, which I didn't remember hearing in the first 2 movies.  Of course, Superman 4, being 2.0, had no sub-woofer sound.  Superman Returns also has some strong sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />Pausing the movies didn't show a bar graph that shows how much time had elasped and how much time remains, like some movies do.  If you want to listen to the movies in English, with sub-titles off, there is no need to get into the Language menu, because it defaults to English, and there are no English options to choose frome.<br /><br />Overall, I think this purchase was worth it, but then again, I didn't spend $80 for it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game can get really challenging. For a free app, it was definitely worth the download! Five stars all the way.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I read the review from \\"tinknave\\" who gave a one star for this product and insisted that the product was bad.  For $30 I thought to take a chance before I could purchase the Cotton Carrier one which sells for $189.  Reading the negative review, my expectations were quite low.<br /><br />The item arrived a day before its scheduled date.  It came in its own carry bag with all the attachments already in its place.  I had to simply tighten the loops to fit my size.  Did not even need the instruction paper that came with it.<br /><br />*****The Quality*****<br />Great!  I had my D7000 with the 80-400 lens having a combined weight of almost 4lbs.  The harness held everything in its place without an issue.  The fabric and the plastic holster are though and sturdy.  After \\"tinknave's\\" review (and his persistent argument of poor quality) I meticulously checked the plastic quality and the stitches to be sure critical.  I couldn't find any issues. From its make, I am guessing that it can easily take 10-15lbs without a problem on each holster.<br /><br />I am not sure what \\"tinknave\\" purchased, however, this product is awesome.  I am glad that I took the risk of purchasing the Opteka and saved myself $150 ($189-$29) from purchasing the Cotton Carrier.  Makes me think that expensive may not always be better.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|When I first saw this book, I thought wow, a dark horror novel. But, after the first 20 pages I found it to be something else. I couldn't put this book down in the 5 days it took me to read it. It was intriguing, profound, and very descriptive. I felt like I was right next to Jacob the entire time. I also learned many new words. The pictures really added to the element of suspense and helped me understand the characters better. I wish there was a photo of Jacob though. My one question is did the author connect the pictures or is this a true story? Are there really levitating girls and prophetic boys? The novel got me to think about what really lurks in this strange world. One thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. There wasn't any closure. It was a total cliff-hanger that left me with a sense of urgency to read a sequel. I want to know what happened to Jacob, his friends, his family, and most of all Miss Peregrine and if they will find her. The first word I said immediately after finishing was \\"What? That's it?\\" I would've given it five stars if there was closure. All I have to say is Ransom Riggs (And by the way I love the author's name) you better make a sequel to this fantastic novel!
B003B02O14|5.0|John Grisham has out done himself again.  Another well written novel.  The book was very hard to put down as it kept you interested until the last page was read.  I would definately recomend this book to someone else.  I'm off to read another Grisham novel.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|Even though I was not able to watch this movie through Amazon (where i originally rented it), because for some reason Amazon couldn't keep a connection any longer than 2 minutes, I will still review it. Took me 2 hours to watch 10 minutes of the movie. Ended up renting it through Blockbuster which had no problem staying connected. The movie was decent compared to the preceding ones. Not as much action as the last movie but it does leave you waiting for the next movie.*SPOILER* In my opinion all the action has already happened in the series, unless the last movie doesn't follow the books.
B00689IUEK|5.0|I am a fan of this cd.  I can put this cd in and ride for days.  It's kinda filthy but I'm well over 18.  It's one of those cd's that you cannot listen to when your children or parents are in the car though.  LOL
B005COO1X6|1.0|I am King's \\"biggest fan\\" from Annie to Captain Tripps. This, however,is the worst novella ever. What has happened to Stephen King? This short sucked and no one should have ever spent $1 much less any more. Horror? Not even close. Don't waste your money. Awful, stupid and boring.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The nice thing about this app is that it works in the background if you want to read or do other things while you fall asleep.  You can set the sound levels then close the app and it keeps going until you go back in and shut it off.  It's got dozens of sounds, from basic white noise to beaches and boats and frogs - though who would want to fall asleep to the sound of a faucet dripping?  That one just puzzles me.  I'm pretty sure its for pranks - I could see setting a sibling's machine to create the sound and hiding it, then watch them go nuts trying to find the source.<br /><br />Separate timers and alarm allow you to have the sleep sounds wind down at one time and the alarm come on at a different time, which I find great to wake up gently.  Most of all, it drowns out much of the ambient noise so you can sleep.  On a medium to high setting, it even works well for light to moderate snoring - I can sleep through most nights now.  Of course, nothing will work for a really heavy snore but this one comes pretty close.  The app ccasionally locks up, but that's rare.  You should double check the alarm settings when you change them, as sometimes it wants to keep the old settings instead. A solid buy if you're looking for a good night's sleep.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I had seen a number of reviews dismissing this movie as a travesty, and I waited past the theatrical release for this Blu Ray release, but now that I've seen it, I have no idea what the critics are dissing. Perhaps they're like the geeks who would never buy an iPad and long for the days of the MS DOS command line and IRQ settings. ,<br /><br />This is an absolutely wonderful movie. Very close to the spirit of Tin Tin and a film we'll watch numerous times. I think the move to 3d, ie animation, is the biggest visual hurdle from the flat cartoons, but the rest of the motion, detail and color are spot on for translations from the books. I only hope there is at least one additonal film from this.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|Most music listeners understand that multiple listens are sometimes necessary for any particular collection of songs to hit home, to come around and appeal.  With \\"Angles,\\" for me, it took a few listens and when it hit, WOW! it hit solidly.  Initially I found the sound to be a little too crisp, almost tasting of stainless steel or some other cold, sterile metal.  It simply seemed void of any warmth.  But yeah, I was missing \\"it,\\" (whatever \\"it\\" is).  I listened again, and somehow was intrigued enough to keep going.  It must have been the jazz that grabbed me enough in the beginning.  Regardless, after a handful of listens I began to hear and understand the intricacies in the songs, the very (what I thought to be) well thought-out layers of intentional shifts that gave the songs life, color and shall I be so bold to say: \\"pizazz.\\"  The songs were not as void as I initially believed.  I believe this recording is representative of very skilled songwriting and decent enough production.  Perhaps the production side of this recording is what leaves it wanting in anyway whatsoever, I am not entirely sure.  But in the end, if we consider how rare it is to hold any album in hand and regard it as complete, containing many great songs that work as a collection of songs to ultimately serve as a work of art, well; this album is a success at achieving \\"art.\\"  It is a solid work that does exactly as intended.  It really is good.  Very Good!
B00004U45G|4.0|The first time I listened to the album, I was impressed with the awesome live performance.  Jimmy Page sounded great on guitar.  But I read on Wikipedia (on the page for the Black Crowes) that \\"In October 1999, the band was joined by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for two pairs of shows in New York and Los Angeles, yielding a live release, Live at the Greek on TVT Records. Due to contractual issues with Columbia, Live at the Greek does not feature any of the band's songs performed with Page\\".<br /><br />It sure sounds like Jimmy Page on these songs.  I am assuming TVT records go the contractual issues resolved.  Whether or not it is Jimmy playing on the album, it is an awesome album.  I would have rated it five stars, but I rated it four stars due to the uncertainty.<br /><br />You may want to do you own research before buying this album.
B0072X2NUS|3.0|I don't like the fact that there are no vocals.  I for sure thought that Martin would be singing on this album.  To my horror no volcals.  I can only give this album 3 stars it is very repetitive and with none of Martin's vocals what's the point, really?  I am lost.  But overall it is an okay album if you like mellow, raver sounding beats.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The ads go away after awhile. I really like the fact that it keeps a running total of the percentage of random hands won.
B005FITILO|5.0|Is it wrong of me to say that the last 20 minutes of this film gave me an epiphany? I can so relate with Mavis Gary. I think we all can, at least a little bit. I was so surprised to find that this film hit on so many points so accurately it was scary. I was not expecting this film to touch me in the way it did. Please, if you know how I feel, and I'm sure there are many out there who do, watch this movie. You will not be disappointed!
1844137872|5.0|This book is awesome! It captures the feel of Banksy and his work very well. If you want top learn more about stenciling or you like it already, this book is for you.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is a classic and no matter when I watch it I still cry at various scenes, great classic movie
1451627289|5.0|My first Stephen King novel, and literally could not put the book down.I know I will be seeing a movie of this novel.My wife has read a number of his novels, and has agreed with me.Having lived through this tragedy, we realize the research needed for this project.<br />great for us conspiracy theorists.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I received an e-copy of this book directly from the Author, Rebecca Hamilton, in exchange for a fair and truthful review, & I am SO glad I did!<br /><br />First of all, let me say that I hope to have a print copy of The Forever Girl on my bookshelf eventually because I think the cover is AMAZING! What can I say? I love to collect awesome books with gorgeous covers!!<br /><br />Now on to the story itself! I really love the main character, Sophia. She has so many things against her including, but not limited to: a crazy religious fanatic stalking her, a mother who is in the midst of a seemingly mental breakdown, a town that thinks she's either crazy or a witch, and to top it all off....she has a never ending buzzing in her head. But she doesn't crack and become weak under all the crap bearing down on her, sure she has issues as a result...but wouldn't you? All of the characters are BELIEVABLE and I don't want to spoil anything...but OMG the whole Ivory situation caught me off guard...and honestly, that's when I really fell in love with the story line! I love Charles, and I find myself wanting to know more about Adrian! I cannot WAIT for the second book! Bravo, Rebecca! :)<br /><br />~Peggy @ bookabsorption.blogspot.com
0810945797|5.0|The Dark Crystal is often considered a nice little kids film, with some great Hensen puppets, some interesting characters and great imagery .  But the film does not show the depth and richness of the world made by Brian Froud  & Jim Hensen.<br /><br />Once you get this book (and it's not cheap) you will never see the film in the same way again. The book is chock full of \\"Oh I didn't know that!\\" details and background.<br /><br />In many ways it shows that they did like Tolkien did- create a complete world, then do the story.<br /><br />The art here is beyond beautiful and baroque. It also has a almost steam-punk feel in some ways.<br /><br />For fans of the film, see the film again, then read this book. Then- watch the film one more time. You will be amazed.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I fell in love with this series just by chance.I had been seeing commercials for it on regular TV & thought that it looked really good. WELL IT WAS..so I finally buckled down & bought the first season. It arrived to me only slightly used with DVDs that were in really good condition.The seller I bought it from took special precautions with my DVDs by removing them from the actual case & putting them in more secure snap Cd DVD cases, he shipped them to me (along with their original box)with a short (HANDWRITTEN) note explaining what he had done..this guy is wonderful. I have bought several things from Amazon in the past, but this guy or girl made the experience of buying something used online a very pleasant one. He definitely has me as a continuing customer...PS the main character, Andy Whitfield,,,,TOO FINE:)[[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus: Blood and Sand - The Complete First Season]]
B005HSG3U6|1.0|This cover is falling apart.  The \\"glossy\\" part of the corners started peeling within weeks of purchasing.  Cheap - you get what you pay for.  Not worth the money!
0385534639|5.0|This is a brilliant novel - an enchanting, magical world of the night circus explored with amazing characters, a fantastic storyline and lovely turn of phrase rarely seen. Thoroughly enjoyable read.
0439023521|5.0|This book was amazing... I'm really wondering if the movie can do it justice. We will see, I suppose. I have also read book 2 and 3 and can say that the author truly followed through to a good conclusion.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is great if you play it for fun, but it can be a giant time drain if you are competitive and play against friends. I cannot count how many hours I have spent staring at my phone and trying to see how many pieces of fruit I could slice in half in a single stroke to get a better score than my friends. There is virtually no learning curve- you slice the fruit in half with your fingers.<br /><br />I will say that if you have an older phone you will probably see some lag, but it worked great on my Samsung Captivate and performs even better on my Skyrocket.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 7 yr old Grand Daughter loves it. She is better at it then me. Makes them think ahead. Planning and logic. stop and think what there actions will cause.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game love visiting other restaurants and the owner creation. can change measly from one game to anther no freezing
B0001HAISG|3.0|Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This latest version of the oft-filmed story by J.M. Barrie is a live-action adaptation which is quite good. My favourite scene is when Mrs. Darling holds Michael on her lap. I recommend this version for one-time viewing only, as it's slightly intense for young audiences, but for those who think cartoons are only for babies, this is the version for you. Though I also liked that the tradition of having the same actor who plays Mr. Darling also plays the malevolent Captain Hook (in this case, Jason Isaacs; a memorable villain in The Patriot). Some funny moments, but clearly not as memorable as the Disney film. And the visuals are also really good, especially in the sequence when they're flying to Neverland. I'll stick with the Disney version.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|after spending 45 minutes with a kindle service person,it was determined there is no way to delete docs from the app.you know,I just deleted the app.fix this,adobe,or continue to provide a 1/2 a** app.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film is pretty good. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a salesman who's forced into pharmaceutical sales after he gets a little too cozy with the boss' wife, and Anne Hathaway (\\"The Princess Diaries,\\" \\"The Princess Diaries 2\\") plays a young woman who has Parkinson's Disease. The film is good in depicting people with the disease and exposing the utter callousness of others. I recommend this movie.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I bought the Phantom of the Opera, 25th Anniversary Concert.  I was expecting a great performance but I was blown away.  If you are a fan of Phantom, this is a must purchase!!!!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I don't have anything negative to say about this series on HBO at all.  I love this ( as well as the book ) and I can't wait until Season 2 begins.  :)  It is for mature audiences only.  Lots of things kids don't need to watch.  Love all the characters. Very well directed. What more could you ask for?

1451673442|5.0|I have to say from the outset that I am a big fan of Rhonda Byrne's work; but I'm a fan of it because her books and film have literally transformed my life.  Although I was always a naturally happy and optimistic person, now I would describe myself as a joyful person (most of the time!  We can't and are not meant to always be joyful).  The joy comes from knowing that absolutely nothing is impossible for me and my life, from knowing the power of goodness and love, from knowing that nothing just 'happens' to me, and from knowing that I can affect any change of circumstance that I wish for my own life.  Also, The Secret led to my now strong spiritual faith - a knowing that this physical world with its miraculously precise laws is not an accident of evolution, and that there is much more to life, the world, and our place in it than our senses would have us believe.<br /><br />So, it was no surprise to me that I loved The Magic.  It was, though, a surprise to me that I loved it as MUCH as I did and do.  In fact, I can confidently say that The Magic is my favorite of Rhonda Byrne's books so far, and, I truly do think, her best book.  I also felt that The Power, her most recent book before The Magic, was better than The Secret, so in a way I feel that Rhonda's books are getting better and better.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Rhonda Byrne's books, and are wondering whether you should just read The Magic, or all three of her books, I would describe them this way:  The Secret is the basic and fundamental work that explains the theory and philosophy of law of attraction, and how to apply it to each area of your life (relationships, health, money, work, etc).  If you don't know a lot or anything about law of attraction, I would read The Secret first.  If you are already familiar with the concept and application of law of attraction, you could easily jump to The Magic, or read both The Power and The Magic.  That said, it is obvious The Magic is written for all people, whether they have ever heard of the law of attraction or not.<br /><br />The Power takes the law of attraction to a much, much deeper level, and is a more 'spiritual' book than The Secret; it has less of a material world focus than The Secret (less about getting the house, car, job, etc. that you want, and more about love, happiness, and realizing the beauty and meaning of life), and encourages the reader to think beyond the physical world.<br /><br />The Magic is like the best of The Secret and The Power combined, AND it has something that neither of the other two books have - a day-by-day practical application of the knowledge.  There are 28 days of gratitude practices, and collectively they cover every area of your life, targeting the power of law of attraction through gratitude at your health and body (and your feelings about your body), your relationships, your job, your money, your daily life, and any problems or negative situations you might be facing.  With every passing day you will feel an ENORMOUS difference in your mood and emotions, you will see a big difference in how your days unfold (they seem so much easier, smoother, and more fun and joyful), and with your changing feelings and attitude you will see each of those areas of your life improving, flourishing, blossoming.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the practice of gratitude (what The Magic is all about) is the absolute fastest way to a magical, joyful life.  It's also, for me, the most natural and enjoyable way of making my life better!  I would much prefer to write a gratitude list than visualize something I want to happen.  Practicing gratitude just FEELS so good - and the more you do it, the more you want to do it!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.

B001P06GX4|5.0|It's a fun game for the whole family. I can play it with my five year old or my husband or both of them at the same time. It forces people to think. It's not frustrated, it's a short game. The rules are so simple. Although it says you can play it with 2-3 or 4 people, if the game is between two adults it's not very challenging.  My only complain would be that the game board is light-weighted plastic, I don't know how long will it take too see cracks on it. Since it's made of cheap materials the price is a little bit too much but in my case was worth it.
B004V2AWKG|5.0|By Shani<br /><br />Jonas was a happy, twelve-year-old boy, who lived his day to day life with a rigid routine: going to school, playing with friends, doing volunteer hours and spending time with family in his dwelling. He lived a peaceful, perfect life of Sameness. He and his fellow members of society each went through the many ceremonies, each providing new opportunities. All of these later led to the very last one: The Ceremony of Twelve, the much anticipated celebration into adulthood. This is where they get their life's assignment. When the time came for Jonas' Ceremony of Twelve, he was in for the shock of his life. In just one day, Jonas was given an honorable position in his society. No one would look at him the same way again. During his training, Jonas learned the truth about his society and its past. Slowly, Jonas' life changed and so did his thoughts until they transformed into something more. He was determined to know what lay Elsewhere, outside of his utopian society. His thoughts transformed into an action, and off he went into the darkness.<br /><br />The Giver is written so differently from any other book that I have read. It is the type of book that many adolescents may not be able to fully understand, since it is describing a society so different from ours. From the way Lowry described Jonas' society, it would be classified as a utopian society. There are no troubles, except for very superficial emotions that the people feel, minimal choices, and rigid rules. The society is dull, civilized, and focused on perfection. Lowry seems to have developed her own vocabulary especially for The Giver. She uses words like, Sameness, Elsewhere and stirrings, which can only be fully understood after carefully reading the context in which it is used. I also notice that she is fond of using cliffhangers. At the end of each chapter, the very last sentence is either shocking or a riveting description. Regardless, it was a page-turner.<br /><br />The Giver turned out to be one of my favorite books. It was interesting for me to picture our society being similar to Jonas'. I thought that maybe it would be a good thing because there would be no wars, no poverty, and no worries. As I got to the end of the book, I began to think that maybe it is not such a good idea after all-a life without freedom. What makes life worth living is the different problems we face and how we use our ingenuity to solve them and I think that Lowry was successful in opening my eyes towards this fact. I feel that this is an important message for children aged twelve and above.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this is the worst app I ever downloaded you just touch the screen and all of the dot fly around what fun is that and I thought it had to do with stars so I made the worst mistake of my life so don't download this crap.p.s I'm giveing.it 5stars because I feel bad for whoever made this.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|Great follow up to the first version.  Nice variety of terrain,  challenging courses increase replay value.  BUG: Tilt controls are not working in this version, which is a pretty large oversight by the developer.  This particular game needs this option.

B001GA1RFA|3.0|\\"Books are the ultimate Dumpees; put them down and they'll wait for you forever; pay attention to them and they'll always love you back.\\" This is a quote from the book, \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" by John Green and it is most definitely true. I did not like this book at all and even though I would ignore it, it would still be there. Forever.<br /> Colin Singleton is a genius and an anagramming master. He is 17 years old and has a knack for girls named Katherine; he has dated 19 girls, all named Katherine. When Katherine number 19 (or K-19) dumps him, Colin and his best friend, Hassan, set off on a road trip to get Colin's mind of K-19. They end up in a small town by the name of Gutshot where they meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother, Hollis. Thus starts an adventure no one will forget.<br /> When I say no one will forget it, I am exaggerating--a lot. \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" is extremely dry and boring for the first 7 or 8 chapters. The rest of the book isn't as boring but still not exciting. I literally had to make myself sit down and force myself to read it. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Andrea Bocelli and David Foster,what more can you say about 2 people that have made it to the top in the music world.The show was of perfection on everynote.Shows of this caliber are not seen every day or in this case every year.It was worth every penny in price for this DVD to watch a Holiday concert of this type on your big screen tv if you have one ,it is the next best thing to being there live.A great show if you were able to even get tickets for something like this,but I was very satisfied just having a DVD, to watch the talents of these 2 wonderful people perform with style and class,something that you just don't get much of anymore.Only on PBS will you see shows of this kind,and when I saw this one on PBS,I just had to order it,for I am a big fan of both of these artist in music.Found it on Amazon,they came through as always,price was wright,service was great and just in time for some great Christmas family entertainment.Beats watching all the garbage thats on the tube these days.On a score of 1 to 10,I give it an 11,a must have DVD if you like the talents of these 2 stars,the writting talents of David Foster that he brings to the music world,and the most powerful Adrea Bocelli voice,a must have for your concert collection.

B004UXUX7S|2.0|I'll keep it short also.  Although I am a big Clooney fan, I did not like this movie.<br />It starts out with a reality check about Hawaii: traffic jams, cancer, etc.  Not my view of Hawaii and probably not one promoted by the Hawaiian tourist bureau, but most likely the view experienced by the locals.  The movie goes down hill from there.  Clooney's family is dysfunctional.  His wife is dying and dies.  She has cheated on him while living.  His daughters are foul mouthed and have their own issues.  His larger tribal family is trying to sell their pristine ancestral family land to developers to make some money, actually a fortune.<br />I felt sad and depressed after watching this.  It was certainly not an uplifting flick.
B006MW3VGA|1.0|A classic for those with a need for soap opera.  Plots are hilarious and direct from Monty Python:  \\"I drowned on the Titanic...no I didn't I'm all better now\\"  \\"My spine is transected and I'm impotent, I can never have an heir...oh wait hello what's this?  I'm all better\\"  Countesses running off with chauffeurs and farmers.  It's all too silly.  Watch Maury or something more real.
0385344228|5.0|This was the type of book I normally would not read because with the words \\"courtroom\\" and \\"murder\\",  I think sensationalism.  But this book was everything except \\"exaggerated\\".  There was true family psychology, a real love story, mystery and thriller, submerged in heartbreak and disbelief.  The characters were real and intelligent.<br />No sap...<br />The story within the story became evident quietly and purposefully. Chapeau.<br />I would definitely recommend this book. Again and again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites. I haven't been hooked on a series this much since twilight and I was in love with twilight.
0525478817|5.0|After reading the review in Time magazine, I decided to read this book.  I teach in a middle school, so young adult books sometimes draw my attention.  Some who review this book with only one star are concerned about the cancer facts and their accuracy, or about the imperfect logic of some events.  That is not the purpose of a novel - for ANY age.  I love that this book takes cancer patients and makes them human.  Gives them teen interests and thoughts that go beyond their worries about cancer.  I think the author has given some insight into the lives of the characters and their real-life counterparts that can benefit any reader.  My book will be donated to our school library with high recommendations.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Once I started reading the Motal Instruments Series I totally fell in love!<br /><br />I must say, imma total book-addict. Once I start a book i like, im bound to finish it that night, even if it takes until 4 am, who cares about sleep :)<br /><br />When i began this book i was kind of hesitant, i had heard of this series and didnt know if the whole 'demon slayer, mythological crap' was for me. I realized in a matter of minutes that i totally loved the demon blah blah blah. It was so interesting and unlike anything i've ever read.<br /><br />I think that this series was one of the best ive read so far. It was like i was immedietly sucked into the life of a shadowhunter. Classandra Clare in my opinion wrote very well, unlike some books i have read, Cassandra was able to make everything come to life. the characters are spectacular and the plots have interesting twists and turns thrown in everywhere. You dont find youself bored with what was happening, there was a constant string of action that kept you hooked!<br /><br />Something else i really liked about thiis book was the humor. i found myself cracking up to things like...<br /><br />&#34;When life gives you lemons,<br />you make lemonade<br />then throw it in the face of the person<br />who gave you the lemons<br />until they give you the oranges<br />you originally asked for.&#34;  -jace<br /><br />I adore Jace and Simon and their comical humor spread throughout the book. it is assured that if you read this you are bouund to laugh at least once!<br /><br />So with that i highly recommend this as  must read book. i find it to be orignal and pretty hilarious and i sure wasn't disappointed!!!<br /><br />also don't forgot about the books that come next, such as<br /><br />The City Of Ashes<br />The City of Glass<br />The City of Fallen Angels<br />The City of Lost Souls (Which comes out May 8 2012...yippee!!!!)

0800141660|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It's ranked among the top ten movies I've ever seen.  I can easily relate to all the characters who were brilliantly created by Jane Austen.  This has got to be the best movie adaptation of any Jane Austen story out there.  I've seen the BBC version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" which is also amazing (I own both the Blu Ray and DVD versions of it) and it was amazing but this still tops the list.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Jane Austen or just loves a good romantic film.

0449806979|1.0|I'm sorry, but I don't think a person who had a threesome with their husband AND wrote about it for all the world to read (including her own children one day) has a leg to stand on in giving advice on how to parent.<br />I was excited to read this book at 1st, but then I read her story on the threesome and I couldn't bring myself to take parenting notes from someone who could potentially bring emotional pain to her children. why do you think she had Marie-Claire take down the piece while she was promoting her book?
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Our entire family, ages 4-35 enjoys this game. We never wait in the doctor's office or the dentist's office without it anymore. It is fun, educational, easy to play, and challenging to get us thinking and even debating over the correct answer! Fun for all!
B0063IH60K|4.0|its great, good quality and just like all other solitaire games, but it lets you pick if you want a winning deal or random. I mean, that sort of defeats the purpose of the game: you win some deals, you lose some, but its up to YOUR skill (unless its a bad deal), NOT a RIGGED deal.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|After watching this movie; anything can come to the big screen. Reality film with a twist. I enjoyed it very much. Who would have thought, a movie about trolls can actually seem realistic...Great watch.
B005OV1NME|1.0|I am sure Verdi turned over in his grave when he saw how badly his opera was presented.<br />Having cowboys and Indians mixed up on the set was plainly disgusting.  There were other parts that I did not like.  They replaced the ballet with  cowboys and indians.

B0000C8AW7|5.0|While I already had a Limited Editon of this Cd ,at the price point it was offered I wanted to hear the SACD version. I was not disappointed, this changed the whole presentation of the work, like this may have been the way it was to be heard.<br />I have many of older Dylan Cd's that have been remastered into SACD and some are better than others, which is probably true of the orignal masters.<br />In closing, the SACD versions are in most cases bring these recordings to an modern level of what we expect fidelity and clarity. P.S. I love SACD, HDCD, would never think of the hassle of vinyl and at present replacing parts of my Jazz collection with items from the APO Catalog and in some cases replacing recent remasters of the same title.<br />And I am not involved nor have ever been involved with any of the firms mentioned, just a music lover.

B006BQI5ZE|3.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Well, MOST of this film.  I seem to feel this way about a lot of Hollywood films and thought I wouldn't have the same problem with Sarah's Key, but I did.  Film had me, I was engaged, engrossed, and then it happened.  The ridiculous end.  I honestly felt they ran out of time and money.  Yes, I know films aren't shot in sequence, but whenever the ending was shot, they botched it and botched it royally.  The reveal was horribly acted, the camera was stuck on one shot for the longest time.  It felt like the director took lunch while they were shooting it and editing it.  I recommend the film for the first three quarters and then just shut it off.  Not knowing the end or seeing the end will be better for you than watching all the way through.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! It is such a great read and hard to put down. If you haven't read this series yet, get all of them first before you start because you're going to want to read the next one right away.

The navigation between levels is easy and the challenges are fun.

B006P0FIGU|1.0|(1.) Tiresome and poorly performed knockoffs of already cheaply produced Hong Kong martial arts stunts.<br />(2.) Wire use for jumps and high speed camera for slow motion effects besides lacking creativity simply looked cheap and seemed out of place.<br />(3.) Acting was show up at set and read lines. Dialogue attempted to be clever by sounding like 21st century actors trying to sound like the standard movie stereotype for movies showing that period.<br />(4.) Costumes and props looked like they were made by a newly graduated art & design school graduate for a doll manufacturer.<br />(5.) Lots of gimmicky special effects that distracted from whatever story might have existed but got lost. Tomb Raider and Raiders style effects were noncreative knockoffs.<br />(6.) Stereotype of arrogant handsome prince and attractive princess substory seemed gratuitous to satisfy producer bottom line income.<br />(7.) Shaun the Sheep has better modeling than what was shown here.<br />(8.) As other people have pointed out the DVD freezes in the menu Language selection in some Sony players.

030788743X|5.0|*best Comic Book Guy voice* Best... Book... Ever!  From the first pop culture reference, I was hooked... RPGs, anime, video games, love, loss, surprises, the 80s, the future, lots of badies, and one hell of an adventure! I had never even heard of Ernest Cline before I chanced across this book (although, I subsequently learned he penned the movie Fan Boys) and decided to take a chance on something that sounded interesting. Cline writes in an extremely witty, smart style that endeared me to the main character from the outset.  I would not hesitate to read anything else by Cline, and having this book made into a movie is now my fondest wish. If you are a child of the 80s, if you are or were ever a gamer, if you are a geek, or if you just like well-written, action-packed, humorous novels with a solid plot and cool characters, this book is definitely worth your time.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't been a Stephen King fan - not because I don't like his writing........he is a fabulous writer. But, he writes so well that his books/movies scare me. I still have nightmares about \\"Misery!!\\" But, upon a friend's highly enthused recommendation, I decided to read 11/22/63. Well, it is absolutely one of my all-time favorite books. I recommend this to EVERYONE! It is one of the most interesting, clever, beautifully written, books I have ever read! I literally could not put it down and was seriously sad when I finished it! Besides being historically correct, the details of the actual 11/22/63 and the events leading up to it, intertwined with such an exciting and unusual, almost science fiction type way,  were written in a most fascinating way. This  is a fabulous \\"book\\" for all ages......people who recall the actual event so clearly, and those who were not yet around and do not know that much about that life-altering event - this is an absolute must read!

B006JD48NM|4.0|Get out your flamethrowers, Senna fans. I just watched this documentary, and after all they build-up, I've come away a bit disappointed. I can't jump blindly on the five-star wagon. Some background:  I got hooked on F1 while watching Mario race a Lotus in the Long Beach GP. I've attended a few F1 races, along with watching them religiously when they were live on ESPN, and now on Speed. Also have done a bit of road racing in my 72 Datsun 510 painted like a BRE car; point being I'm not an expert or a wanker, but somewhere in between. I remember the race in Monoco when they called it due to rain, and thought at the time these Senna and Bellof (no mention of him in the documentary) guys were going to be great.<br />The good:<br />-Had forgotten the details of the 1st wreck with Prost, and now have to agree that Senna got a bad deal, but also think he made up for it the next year by taking out Prost.  So, call that one even.<br />-Some of the early shots of karting and personal interviews are great - gives you an insight into the man's thought process<br />-Although probably unintended by the documentary, I though it showed Prost to be the better man (maybe not the racer) in that he did not seem to make the rivalry personal, and was big enough to be a pallbearer.<br />-Was not aware how deep his love of country and the less fortunate - that was touching<br /><br />The not so good:<br />-It downplays the skills of his nemesis, Prost - they were both great drivers, just went about it differently<br />-The documentary also fails to present anything that would show Senna in a bad light - no mention of his aggressive driving that at times was reckless. In fact, hardly anything negative is said, which is required to present a true picture of the man.<br />-Not enough in-car stuff for me; expected more. Perhaps that's my racing bias.<br />-Complaints about politics in F1 - that's been going on for years, so just deal with it.<br /><br />In closing, I plan to watch the film at least two more times, so my opinions after the initial pass may change.<br />An F1 documentary I would recommend is \\"Jackie Stewart - The Flying Scot\\" available on Amazon.  It's fair to say that Jackie created the modern F1 driver image, and had the skills to back it up. He came from humble beginnings, both personally and professionally. I really enjoyed the shots of him with Ken Tyrrell at the old garage, and the fade-in sequence of him driving the car again at Monaco years later over top the original race.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|This is a pretty good game but really I just want somebody to tell me how to beat level 24! :(
B000JY8F22|4.0|I wasn't sure what I was going to get out of this movie or if I was going to get anything or, for that matter, enjoy this movie.  I really did enjoy it.  The movie was put together quite well.  There are parts where you feel the emotion when it goes into slowmo and you see how well the actors play the parts.<br /><br />It's a movie that starts out in a love triangle by way of passion and in an instant, the passion starts randomly but strong between two people.  But, Jude's character is a hopeless romantic and finds love and laughter with one girl and sees beauty and more in Julia's character.  Julia's character is probably the closest to how many women feel.  We stay away from drama because we know the bad boy will get us into trouble but once the dive has been taken, it's hard to turn away.  Jude's character falls for Julia's and they start a secret relationship despite there being another girl in the picture.  To play a trick on Julia, Jude hooks up Julia and another guy.  Everyone finds out who the other is and Julia ends up being in the middle of two men who are madly in love with her.  While Jude is in his relationship with \\"Alice\\", Julia marries the other guy (totally forgot character names as you can tell) but then has an affair with Jude.  Julia asks for a divorce from her husband but her husband has one single request before signing the papers.  I've left a lot out so you can watch it for yourself. In the end, you find out about a secret kept the whole time.<br /><br />The movie is quite vulgar so be careful who you watch it with.  I've never had a relationship where vulgarity was this bad so I can't relate to that.  There is cursing, no sex scenes but vulgar lines in the movie.  I like that a movie can show passion and the characters show lots of emotion while the watcher knows exactly how deep the relationships went without nude scenes and sex constantly thrown into a scene.  There is love, lust, passion and lots of emotion without the sap.<br /><br />Theonly reason I gave it 4 stars is because it could have been just as good without the F bombs and vulgarity.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|Power A decided to cater to multi-platform gamers by making a PS3 controller with an Xbox360 layout.  The result is not without flaws, but functions adequately enough.<br /><br />The first and most obvious benefit of the Pro Elite is that it's been designed to mimic the Xbox360 controller's layout.  This comes as a boon to those of us who spend most of our time on Xbox, but crave the occasional PS3 exclusive.  The Pro Elite layout is close enough to the Xbox that I felt right at home with it, and didn't encounter any of the usual disorientation that comes with picking up a DualShock3.  And, speaking of Sony's flagship controller, the Pro Elite has both rumble and Sixaxis features that perform as they should.  Add in a slightly cheaper price tag for the Pro Elite and you have yourself a decent package.<br /><br />Before opening up your wallet, though, there are a few concerns to point out.  For reasons unknown to me, Power A chose to include non-standard features such as textured grip and backlit buttons.  At first I found the grip to be a good thing, keeping the controller tight in my hands.  However, I soon discovered that the grips were a little too pointy and led to discomfort during even the most modestly extended play sessions.  As for the button backlighting, I found it more distracting than helpful.  After all, as a serious gamer I really can't recall the last time I needed to look down at a controller to find the right button.  The lighting also bled badly around the \\"Guide/PS\\" button, suggesting cheap build quality and making it very difficult to distinguish between players.<br /><br />While attempting to innovate with new features, Power A missed a couple of obvious opportunities to improve upon the standard Sony controller.  Rather than increasing the weight to be more consistent with an Xbox controller, the Pro Elite feels too light.  And, instead of creating a user-changeable battery pack a la the Xbox360 controller, the Pro Elite stayed with Sony's design, forcing you to plug in the controller to top off the juice.<br /><br />The biggest offender, though, was the decision to connect the controller via a wireless USB dongle as opposed to built-in Bluetooth.  I'm sure this design element saved a few bucks, but the dongle is rather large and unsightly when plugged into the front of the PS3.  Furthermore, the range is fairly poor and suffers from frequent interference.  The dongle approach also precludes being able to turn on the system with the controller, which is simply asinine.<br /><br />Although frustrating, the flaws are not deal-breakers.  The lower price tag and ability to switch seamlessly between Xbox and PS3 is valuable enough that I can overlook a few minor gripes.  On the whole the Pro Elite does its job adequately and has replaced the DualShock3 on my coffee table, at least until something better comes along.ign, forcing you to plug in the controller to top off the juice.<br /><br />The biggest offender, though, was the decision to connect the controller via a wireless USB dongle as opposed to built-in Bluetooth.

On the whole the Pro Elite does its job adequately and has replaced the DualShock3 on my coffee table, at least until something better comes along.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read. It exceeds all expectations and is absolutly amazing.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|decent game. basic logic. kids can play it as easily as any adult. sometimes the difficult is out of order though
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game managerie is a lot of fun I enjoy playing it<br />h. I would. recommend it to anyone even small. children could play
B001RIY4WE|2.0|You're better off with the HD DVD version of this movie instead.<br /><br />The movie itself is worthy of 5 or more stars, but the transition to Blu-ray is awful.  There's absolutely no difference between the HD DVD version and the blu-ray.  Film grains are STILL seen in the Skynet Edition.  The picture looks very clean and high-def in brightly lit scenes, but in darker environments, the graininess is ridiculously noticeable.  You would think that they'd clean that up!<br /><br />Also, if you notice, nowhere on the blu-ray case itself does it say the magic code, 1080p.  Usually, the 1080p designation indicates a crystal-clear image without any major film grains.  Since that's nowhere to be seen on the case, expect the picture to be on the crappy side.<br /><br />Lastly, please note that your Blu-ray player has to be connected to the Internet in order to play this film, and you need to have sufficient hard disk space in order to download the extra features.  Unless you have a PS3, make sure your blu-ray player has enough space or attach a USB drive or external hard drive to it.  Without those peripherals, the movie will not load at all.<br /><br />So in summary, this is a 5-star film, but it's a one-star Blu-ray.  I gave it an extra star because I got it super cheap (less than six bucks).  I bet you it's that cheap because of exactly what I said above.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It was perfect. I liked how you can pick something out throughout the movie that was from the original 60's series and movies 1-6. Great film. Hope this crew comes back for another.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it works fine and didn't give me a virus it also let me download videos for free on the kindle fire
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This movie has to be watched several times its so good. If you are a Star Wars and Star Trek fan there are lots of lines and scenes cleverly in there to find. Its funny!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|worth the money or wait until it's the free app of the day. I like the different options of ways to play. quest is favorite.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|LP enters the User name and password, I press the login button and nothing happens. Kindle Fire doesn't work with the LP browser. I wanted to use the Mint app, not a browser, but it doesn't work with the LP browser either.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game I love it, I could play for hours. Thanks for making it a free app, please keep them coming
1609611543|4.0|I wanted to post this review because I am absolutely shocked at how quickly and easily the no-wheat advice worked (which I just did as an experiment that I was SURE would fail).  The book isn't quite a \\"how to\\" diet book - but it is instead focused on getting the message of why wheat is bad out there.  Here is some of my timeline since reading:<br /><br />In the first week, my cravings for wheat and sugary foods (particularly chocolate) were diminished.<br />In 3 weeks, I lost 10 lbs (without working out) that I could not lose in the last 6 months despite diet and extensive exercise.  (At least 10-15 miles a week of running).<br />By week 4, I was sleeping less and had more energy...cravings were even further diminished to virtually zero.  I am normally a huge fan of Easter candy this time of year - but I just walked by the aisle in CVS unfazed. I have no idea how that happened.  I also lost about 15 lbs by now.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin... to \\"prove\\" things to myself I suppose...I ate a big piece of pita bread tonight, and I am now paying the price with lethargy and brain fog.  Then, I had a massive craving for a snickers bar hidden away here (which I ate..great...)  None of this happens when wheat is out of my diet.  I will say that I have had wheat on and off in the last month (when it was really worth it to me personally... like a really good italian restaurant), but then the weight loss stops and the lethargy set in...so it's a trade off.  And, i am making this trade off less and less these days.  In the beginning, it's hard to transition but then it starts becoming obvious how awful wheat can be.  The cravings come back too.  Suddenly after eating wheat, then I wanted chocolate & ice cream.  It's so bizarre that this happens, but he explains this in the book (e.g., the exorphins and probably other chemicals we don't even know about in wheat do these things)<br /><br />I have not had a single GI issue since removing wheat, but I am also feeling that I over-rely on dairy a bit too much now.  It's hard to formulate a great diet - though that might sound silly...Unfortunately, I am  transitioning out of a 50% wheat diet (yes I was that bad) and it is not that easy. So, the only reason I took off a star is because I wish the book had better tips on what to do.  He makes his argument very strong - but there's a bit of an \\"ut oh now what\\" feeling at the end.  I've been eating eggs, fruits, vegetables, meat, etc... but it seemed to be an awkward transition that had me questioning a lot of things too (are fruits too high glycemic?  Is oatmeal okay?  Can I occasionally have crackers? etc...)<br /><br />This book is incredibly important though, in the grand scheme of things & in the american diet.  Wheat is SO ubiquitous. Cutting down on it could drastically improve heath (and waist size) of everyone in the country - but \\"breaking bread\\" is so integral to our culture.  At least the Celiacs have started raising awareness of gluten intolerance.  I hope more people become aware of the message here.  Spread the word!  Everyone thinks I am nuts when I talk about this, but they cannot deny I am a LOT thinner!<br /><br />Update:  I haven't lost any more weight since the original 15...it's almost like my body wanted to get that off and thinks I'm done now.  I wanted to lose another 10, but I will probably have to work out much more than I am now (30 min every other day doesn't go far anymore I guess).  The book alludes to a variety of health problems being related to wheat but don't get your hopes up. Also, there hasn't been any change in this constant sinus/allergy thing I've had for months. My skin issues haven't changed either.  I didn't really expect this to change - but after reading the book you get a sense that wheat (could be) the cause of all ills... and it's not, realistically.  Also, rereading some pages - I realize the author may be making a \\"correlation implies causation\\" error once taught in statistics class.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I read it with my son 11 year old and loved every minute of it.  When there was a word we didn't understand, we could look it up by just defining it.  The book itself was full of adventure and humor.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this was a good game...if you've played virtual city and liked it, you'll like this take because they are pretty much the same.
B005HHSXP0|5.0|This seires is a great continuation for Persey Jackson and the olimpians. It takes things in an interesting new direction whithout loosing any thing in the plot of eather.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like this game but I hate how the coolest items cost me gems. but otherwise I love this game<br /><br />  #loveit
B00785P2QC|5.0|at first I wasn't sure if I would like the game but it turns out I love it!!!!! hope everyone else likes it as much as I do :)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|i'ts a great game. I had a lot of fun playing it. we need more like this.it's funny and cool.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This is my all time favorite crow movie brandon lee was the absoulte best crow in the series it is such a shame he died on this movie at the young age of 28 years old because someone didnot check the guns right and that was very stupid on their part they should of checked the guns to see if a real bullet was going to be shot out of the gun R.I.P. Bradon Lee you will forevr be missed I wish you were still alive because your crow was just awesome and this movie is the best crow movie ever in the series of the crow series and the crow salvation is the second best one in the series the acting the music and the action were very top notch and this movie was just awesome to watch over and over again.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|has great graphics, fun physics, challenging and enjoyable gameplay! definitely recommended for fans of the genre! had problems with tilt controls not working on my s2 but emailed the dev and got a SUPER fast response! got me fixed up and working very quickly! impressive costumer service for sure!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC.  BY A FLUKE I RAN ACROSS THIS HARD TO FIND VW CAMPER BUS LEGO SET.  IT IS A GIFT FOR OUR SON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.  HE IS GOING TO LOVE IT AND SO ARE HIS 2 GIRLS, THEY LOVE LEGOS TOO.  WE GAVE ONE OF THEM MINDSTORM, IT WAS THE HIT OF CHRISTMAS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH IT FOR MONTHS.  THIS SET WILL BE ANOTHER FAMILY PROJECT, IT IS SUCH A COOL LEGO SET, SO DETAILED.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I first saw the Becker BK2 on he side of my good friend, a Navy SEAL, in Iraq. I asked him about it, and he gushed positively about it. So I ordered one. I fell in love with it right out of the box. This knife went through some moderately heavy abuse in Iraq. I do not 'baby' my knives, especially when I am in a combat zone. It was used expressly in nonstandard ways, and in ways warned against by the manufacturer. I used it as a prying tool, banged it against metal and wood, opened many boxes of heavy cardboard with it. I even used it to cut brush that got attached with the mud on our MRAP. It was hit with water and even some blood. The darned knife kept on functioning. Little bit of discoloration is all that I noticed. Great sheath to attach in any configuration on MOLLE gear or to the side of the ACU pants. Its a bit on the heavy side.<br /><br />Please read through the outstanding reviews here, and figure oit what you need from a knife like this one. If you are headed downrange, consider this fixed blade and a good tactical folder. I carried a Gerber 06 Auto (folder) in my pocket through my last deployment, and it also survived the abuse that I routinely subject knives.<br /><br />I plan on taking yet another BK2 Companion to Afghanistan in the Fall. I can feel assured that  it will not fail me. You can be sure I will bring my Gerber 06 Auto, a Benchmade Griptillian 551SBK, and a good sharpening stone. A multitool is a must, and there are good Leatherman models and the freebie Gerber that everyone gets issued.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Perfect for keeping track of documents, notes, and knitting patterns. I am new to etools and this is perfect for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me begin be saying that I read this book before of any news about a movie being in production, however, if I were to have read it now, a week before the book is set to be released in theaters, I would think that the hype is still not enough. I have read this book, series actually, several times. I cannot seem to put it down. It is excellent not only for YA readers, but also for adults. I like that it is not a sappy love story even though it is and I love that a male would be as much interested in it as what a female would, even thought the lead character is a female. Please take the time to read this book if you haven't; I assure that the only disappointment that you will find is that the story is over.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|this was great best one yet cant wait to see a aln vs prdtr where they go deep into there home worlds like a war of some kind breaks out cuz the aleins are tired of being target practice and the predators have to come to humans for help or both worlds will be infested
B0054JZC6E|4.0|sure passes  the time on a long bus ride! pretty entertaining. just wish there where some two player games so I could have played with the person sitting on the bus with me
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am leaving a reviw on this game to tell you how good this game is this is is one of my favorite game!
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I am not a fan of side scrollers most of the time, but this bike game has got me going for a while now. great game, worth 1.99$
B0043URV5U|5.0|The Ultimate Hits: Rock And Roll Never Forgets by Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band is a must have if you've ever appreciated this band's music. I realized also that some of my favorite songs that I've heard throughout the years were actually this group's greatest hits. I give this group a\\"thumbs up\\"!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me and after I had finished reading The Hunger Games series, I didn't think anything could take me out of that world and into another...But The Night Circus did.<br /><br />This is a mysterious tale, that has a somewhat dark and foggy feel to it... like everything outside of the circus seems black and white...but inside the circus it's all technicolor.. . you feel the warmth of creation and love between the characters and scenes it's as radiant as the sun.<br />Erin has you create the most beautiful, intricate details of her story in your mind. Her imagination knows no bounds in this dangerous tale of star-crossed lovers/magicians.<br />If you are looking for a tale to completely take you away this is the book for you.
B00000DCHI|5.0|For all that have enjoyed the music of Billy Joel this a very good buy. This particular collection of Billy Joel's hits is one of his best if not the best ever!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Warhorse was the most beautiful book I have ever read.  I read it aloud to my 6th grade class.  They were enthralled by the entire book from beginning to the end.  I read it cold; so I experienced it along with the class.  We cried and clapped in various places.  It was perfect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app so much fun I love that you have to earn points to get another game :) I recommend this app to kindle users as well as other devices.
B005HEUGAS|5.0|This season was rather interesting as the characters continue to develop. More depth makes things take on more dimension. Well done!
B003DT19F0|3.0|My daughter asked for this for Christmas which was several months ago. I don't think she watched it as much as some of her other movies.
B00008BXJG|1.0|All I have to say in regard to Highway to Hell is that Mutt Lange turned AC/DC into a pop band.  I can't stand this album; in fact, AC/DC's first four albums are rock classics played by a real rock band--everything else is just horrible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps the whole family busy and playing the games! I would encourage families to download this app. there are games for all ages.
B007BDK3SS|1.0|crashes everytime on my samsung galaxy prevail. fix this and i will reconsider. sad since other trial extreme games work fine for me.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an excellent movie for the whole family.  Men can learn a lot from this<br />movie about parenting.  I highly recommend it!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|great app!! I use it way more then weather channel because it is more accurate and very easy to use
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|this author ruined this series book1 was great book2 wasnt so good then book 3 is terrible is the worst book i have ever read! do not get this book you will regret it!!!!
0345531930|5.0|If you've loathe your health insurance provider for making dealing with them your second job, then you will find this book most gratifying.  At first I was nonplussed by the book.  I kept expecting it be a suspense-filled rocket-ride right out of the gate--like every other Grisham book I've read.  It's not like that. But it's compelling and keeps you reading and rooting for the good guys.  I'm here to tell you that if you have insurance of any kind--especially of the medical variety--you will find this story to be a balm to the soul.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|It's hard to know where to start with reviewing a series this complex. The complexity itself is certainly part of the draw, from the intricate worldbuilding to the tangled plots to the exquisite set and costume design. But here are a few points worth noting:<br /><br />1) This is grimdark fantasy at its finest. As such, sympathetic characters will almost never make decisions that lead to good results for themselves, no matter how much sense that decision made at the time based on the information they had available. Viewers are advised to take this into account. Really, just expect that everyone is going to suffer horribly, get maimed, and then die tragically, and you'll get to occasionally be pleasantly surprised. (Or unpleasantly surprised, when it comes to a number of people who don't bite it in season one, whose deaths we're all eagerly waiting for.)<br /><br />2) Characters spout exposition at the drop of a hat. A lot of hats get dropped. The exposition is all marvelous, mind, but this leads to a lot of As You Know Bob and monologuing. HBO has thoughtfully provided lots of gratuitous female nudity to accompany most of this exposition (\\"Look! Here come the Exposition Whores again! It must be time for someone to discuss character and setting background!\\"), which viewers will find either endearing or annoying depending on how they feel about gratuitous female nudity. There's not nearly as much male nudity as you'd expect.<br /><br />3) The production values are stunning. Every set and every costume and every shot is a work of art. The opening credits alone are breathtaking. A lot of it is breathtaking works of art where everyone is covered in mud, wearing brown, and probably half-naked (if female), but credit where it's due. Trying to watch The Tudors after seeing this series first gave me the uncomfortable feeling that the king of England was being filmed while standing in someone's hastily redressed living room or backyard. The world of Westeros comes alive, in this series, with all its gritty grimness.<br /><br />4) The DVD version has an odd glitch at times where it'll keep flashing subtitles briefly on the screen long after the subtitled scene has ended. Go figure.<br /><br />5) The acting is excellent. The plot is excellent, even if it depends heavily on Murphy's Law at times. The characters are mostly complex, though some villains are just outright villainous with no redeeming features whatsoever. It's very grey-and-black morality. People who like that sort of thing will love this series. People who do not like this sort of thing probably will not.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Wow! I'm still thinking about this movie I checked out last night.Seeing Banderas on the box nearly turned me off until I saw that the great Pedro Amoldovar directed it then it became a no-brainer; everything this guy touches is gold.<br /><br />I'll sum up this film without giving away any spoilers or without divulging too many details, just that it's a revenge flick with elements of Frankenstein mixed in with it. And when I say that this is a revenge movie, that is a big BIG understatement to say the least. If you are OK with Takashi Miike's earlier stuff like Gozu or Visitor Q, or if you occasionally crave films like Happiness, The Girl Next Door, Irreversible, A Clockwork Orange, The Piano Teacher--well-done \\"art\\" films that mess with your head--this film is right up your alley. Everyone else, stay as far from this innocent-looking creature as you possibly can because it bites!<br /><br />This film has everything Pedro's previous films has. It's deliciously colorful, gorgeously shot, sensual, kinky, intelligent, surprising. To me, the biggest surprise of this film is the ease by which the sci fi part of the story is told in that it doesn't feel distracting or that it needs to be overly technical. Now, the movie does set up slowly at the beginning from a present day perspective but once the film backtracks to what caused the present situation this is where all the surprises and goodies are. I watch around 700 movies a year, 2+ almost every night, foreign films, anime, shock, etc. and this film is without a doubt up there with the strangest. I enjoyed it, for what it's worth but I won't recommend this film to everyone. Like I said, if you have no trouble with films by the likes of Lynch, Noe, Miike, Cronenberg, etc, you may like this film. Way, way over the top.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love this game, but this is a terrible port. The game crashes &amp; freezes constantly on my Galaxy Nexus rendering it unplayable for more than 30 seconds at a time. Being that it takes longer than that to play a level, this app is completely USELESS as is. Beyond that fatal flaw, the graphics are stretched to fit widescreen rather than reworked to accommodate android devices. Buyer beware. Popcap, get your $4!7 together!
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I'm guessing if you like trial extreme winter you will love this game it is very cool but no tilt option
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I stopped watching regular TV in 2007 because there wasn't anything good to watch anymore. (Amazing how you can have 70 channels & nothing good to watch. Now I only watch my old TV shows on DVD.) But I came across this on amazon.com & it sounded pretty good, so I went ahead & purchased the first season. I enjoyed it very much & purchased the second season. I've watched both seasons a few times & find them entertaining. I am looking forward to purchasing season 3, & season 4 (when available). It's a little pricey, however.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|On my Galaxy S2 (t-mobile) the tilt controls don't work.  The game looks great, and I'll keep it installed to see if they come our with an update.  The on screen controls don't make a good substitute, as it makes the game too complex.
B007JUWM64|4.0|I don't get the senseless ornamentation of 17th century technology. Did Cardinal Richelieu's space suit really need all those jewels and feathers?
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Excellent quality service as always from Amazon and of course the movie is one of those rare moments on film...Kate Winslet and Ralph in top form........but it was region 1 and I am in region 2 in Europe so it would not play ....just in case your wondering how I could review it as it did not play but I had watched it previously with a friend so I thought I would buy it for my Wife as she had read the book and she enjoyed that so the movie was next in her list to do ...but sadly it would not play ...my Bose system would not read it and advised that the DVD was not supported...the details when I was buying it was the one thing I did not read ...lesson learned and will watch that in future ....overall I would recommend it so do not let the above put you off ...go get it one ...just watch the region depending on where you are so it plays for you !!!
1451648537|5.0|The book is excellent, I highly recommend it, took me back to the 60's70's life and music, and gave me the inside on a genius of my lifetime, good and bad.  Great service on the purchase!  Thank YOu!
B0064NTZJO|1.0|This was one of the most boring movies I ever watched. Save your time and money and do not rent or buy this film. Ryan Gosling sounded mono toned throughout the whole movie with poor acting skills. The storyline was slow and pretty much uneventful. The movie is called \\"Drive\\" but there was not much action driving what so ever.
0143118757|5.0|As a first year MBA student, this book has opened the door to new ways of going about interactions that are not being actively taught at the MBA level. For anyone who  is or wants to be an entrepreneur, sales staff, or just looking for a good read this is the book for you.<br /><br />I hope I provided an unbiased and helpful review. Good luck shopping and as always, have a great day.<br /><br />-College Guy
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. It is such a great show and is family friendly. I miss amazing shows like this. I wish they would make more shows like Downton Abbey.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game... some of the games don't work.. but the ones that do are fun... wish some of them worked better.
B000ID37SQ|4.0|everything went well<br />sometimes the video had to pause but that because of the bad internet connection<br />i was happy with the purchase
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app gives me everything I need to know to start my day. installation was not a problem. highly recommend.
B000B8QG4A|2.0|My daughter loves the movie but I hate the noise it makes while playing. I don't know if it is unbalanced or what but it makes a semi loud humming noise when it is being played. Only movie in her collection that does that so I am assuming it is the disc itself. I belive it is an extremely old copy of the movie.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Far superior to the other &quot;Office&quot; products. Seamless operation with good cloud interfaces. I have purchased the other apps and have found this one to be the most professional.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Got this doll and the edward wedding doll today, They are both made very well and bellas dress is a exact replica of her movie dress, These are for sure more of a colector doll and not for the little girl to play with due to many small pieces on the dress but they are well worth the money and so far the most realistic and well made ( twilight ) doll.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|This game is a 3D side-view dirt bike stunt course with nice graphics and a large variety of levels.  The on-screen controls are somewhat complex but they give you detailed gas, brake, lean forward, lean back, and jump control of your bike which you will need to negotiate challenging obstacles like ramps, giant tires, pipes, rocks, and more.  The bike handles realistically and you can see the front and rear suspension load and unload independently. You can do wheelies and flips, hitting your head or taking a big hit sends you back to the beginning or last checkpoint.  Sometimes the physics are unrealistic like going up a 80 degree incline while doing a leaning back wheelie but that's what you've got to do to make it through. The rear wheel on the bike provides the forward momentum and the game accurately models that.<br /><br />The levels are varied in appearance, content and difficulty.  The problem is some of the very difficult levels have no checkpoints so after you get through all sorts of crazy obstacles and screw up near the end you'll have to start over.  And again and again.  Repetition does teach you the controls and techniques but I dislike repeating the whole level over and over on some of the courses.  More checkpoints would be appreciated.<br /><br />Overall this is a fun challenging polished action game that I've had lots of fun with.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Seems everybody is reading this book these days. Seen a girl sit next to me read it on the plane then a week later my daughter can't stop talking about it. Finally decided to see what the hype was about. If I had to compare it in the list of Twilight, Harry Potter and The Hunger Games Series think the Hunger Games won me over the most.  Once you start reading it you won't want to put it down.  My daughter talked about it so much that she got me and her grandma to both read it.  The book is set in the future (100+years past our current day time), there are 12 districts and for punishment for the rebels one boy and girl is chosen to go fight in a arena to death. The story is well written, love Suzanne Collins books. If you buy this one you might as well get the next two because once you finish one you will instantly want to continue into the next one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun, but sometimes I feel that its too easy. It needs a difficulty setter or something. Other than that its good .
B007BDK3SS|1.0|its so fume I rather punch my kindle don't get this app it so dume I rather play the wires app in the world then play this app
B000NHQLPS|4.0|I received the dvd promptly but the dvd metal casing was bent and won't close properly because it was damaged during the mailing process. Can't blame the shipper as it was sent in secure packaging, but it appears that the mail forced the dvd packaging into the mailbox in a hurried manner. Dvd itself was in excellent condition, but the point of steelboxes is the casing, so what are you going to do. se la vi.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Read the book.  Hollywood by necessity has changed a lot to tell a movielength story.  Read the book to get the whole experience.  It is worth rereading too.
B007DX39XW|5.0|FYI if you're thinking to buy this set on Amazon, check the LEGO website first to see how much the retail price is. You will very likely overpay if you buy from a third-party seller.<br /><br />I purchased this at my local LEGO brand store after waiting anxiously for this for a couple months. It is completely worth the wait and although it is more expensive than other modular buidings, I feel that the cost is justified. The building is massive (and I have the Fire Brigade and the Grand Emporium for comparison), it has EIGHT minifigures and the detail is just amazing.<br /><br />At first glance, the Town Hall resembles the Fire Brigade. This is a fair observation but I think LEGO tried to provide a model that fit in with other environment of other modular buildings while providing new designs. The building is three stories high and each story provides a different aspect of the town hall as well as a different architectural design on the exterior. Although the facade has a different design on each floor, it does a great job of diversifying the exterior rather than being disjointed. Having variety in the design also makes it a lot more fun to build. Although there is value in repetition in terms of design in the case of the Grand Emporium, it does get tedious in the actual building process. The Town Hall adds a bit more variety to the building process. The windows are large and bring in a lot of light and I love that they included a balcony that minifigures can actually stand on.<br /><br />Another different feature in this building is the elevator. While the Grand Emporium has the escalator and the Fire Brigade has stairs and sliding pole, the Town Hall adds an elevator to the mix. I really appreciate how LEGO tries to change things up.<br /><br />I feel that with the interior, they tried to not make it as bare as the Grand Emporium or Fire Brigade which were basically open floors with minimal interior structure. The Town Hall has actual rooms in each floor like the lobby, tax office, auditorium and waiting room on the first floor. The second floor has the Mayor's Office in its' own separate room as well. They also tried to bring more design elements into the interior like arches and carpeting and artwork. The interior rooms do make it a bit difficult to play in, though.<br /><br />LEGO did a great job choosing the minifigures and I think they are absolutely adorable. They included the mayor, secretary, a journalist, a boy, a girl, a janitor and a bride and groom. The minifigures are diverse but still appropriate for the setting.<br /><br />There really weren't too many unique elements in this set but I think they were used very cleverly. The pieces that make up the garage door in the Fire Brigade are now used to make up the skylight on the roof. The one strange thing that I found in the set was the bread used for the crest. I'm trying to figure out if they could have used something else to create that effect but I suppose it was the best they could do without introducing another piece into the mix (or using a weapon).<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoy this set. The price is a bit higher than usual but I think its justified for this set. (You do get a lot more pieces than in previous modular building and a bit more minifigures). I do hope that LEGO chooses to scale back down for their next modular building idea and keep the Town Hall as a special case (perhaps as the central building of the block).<br /><br />If you're a huge fan of modular buildings, this is a must have. This has certainly satisfied my appetite for a good modular building after the Fire Brigade and Grand Emporium and will keep me distracted for a long while they think of their next great building idea.<br /><br />This is definitely a set for older children and adults as it is pretty time-consuming and challenging to build. There are many pieces and that alone may frustrate the average child. However, the end product may be something for kids to play with. Onething I have noticed with the instruction manual is that each step will highlight the pieces you are supposed to add on the design. The new additions on each step will be outlined in red or yellow so that it isn't difficult to spot. It's a great idea that I haven't noticed in the other modular sets or any other LEGO sets. Makes the building process a bit easier.<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend buying directly from LEGO or at least checking their website to see the MSRP.

B000B589JI|5.0|Love this!!! i no longer have to tote around fluid anymore lol, and it doesnt leak at all!! great product and idea
B007BDK3SS|4.0|I bought it a week before it was free,  but its ok.  The game looks great and plays best with the button controls.  Only reason i havent given it 5 stars is the lack if levels,  trial x had way more levels,  this one only has 36. If added in an update i will change my rating to a 5 for sure
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am a server at a popular bar/restaurant and have been using this game to kill time in between guests. I've recently been told if I am seen with my kindle at work again I will be fired. WARNING do not play if there are things you have to do, they WILL be forgotten.
B000VWYNOG|3.0|It's a good CD however not what I was expecting. I purchased it for the song \\"In The Garden.\\" I like it for that reason.
B004MOMT2M|1.0|I have a Pioneer DV-610AV DVD-A player. The DVD will not play. After some searching, clearly I'm not the only one with this problem. I have around 10 officially released DVD-A discs and this is the only one so far that the player chokes on.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Deffinetly an app worth paying for. I at first wasn't interested because the ap image led me to believe it would be a very childish game but I was deffinetly proven otherwise. The quality of the game is excellent, the update has happened for all devices, and it's a very well rounded game. I do reccomene a younger crowd considering the simplicity of the game.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I love the app because it actually works for me but the reason why I'm giving it only three stars is that on my kindle - and I'm not sure if the developers of this app can do something or not - I have found a way to bypass the alarm by turning the device off. Yes, you know those mornings when instead of having to deal with the SNOOZE button or Solving the math problem, I just turn the device off. Well, the problem with that is it defeats the purpose of the alarm (and I do this as an involuntary reaction).<br /><br />I hope the developers can find a way to disable shutting the device down. Til then, and since I've found myself waking up a little late than usual, three stars.
B005UG542S|5.0|The last part of Harry potter movies and in my opinion the best one.I purchased blu-ray so I can enjoy all the visual and sound effects and colors,it was worthied.Package arrived on time as estimated.Price was reasonable.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are great! plus u are always able. to win points to open up new and more and more games! I love it! continuous gaming!
B006DICWUE|4.0|I don't know what happened but a pop gem was tarnished with horrendous mastering.  The \\"loudness wars\\" compression will make audiophile ears bleed and those looking for dynamics reach for the Excedrin.<br /><br />I can't wait for the re-mastered re-release (if it ever comes).  The studio masters are probably great.<br /><br />The songs are superb, what a shame.  Still worth owning - and worth complaining about.
B001DTUTU8|5.0|Horton Hears a Who does a marvelous job of staying true to the original story, while keeping adults and children entertained with a mix of dry and physical humor that is sure to captivate the entire family. The cast of voices leaves little to be desired, with the likes of Seth Rogen stealing the show with his clever quips. A must have for any Dr. Seuss fan.
B0036T31YY|4.0|This movie has a lot of twists and turns to it, however if you watch carefully and dont get up to make yourself a sandwich, you should be entertained.<br /><br />There are a number of 1 star reviews, most seem to be from folks who recommend Saw.  Not quite the same ballpark here.  Not that Saw is a bad movie.  This is just a bit more cerebral and requires strict attention to really appreciate it.<br /><br />There isnt much I can say without giving away the storyline and ruining the movie, so I'll just say that if you're not familiar with greek myths, you may want to google Sisyphus either before or after the movie.  After would probably be better.<br /><br />The acting is well done and the gradual realization of the cycle and whats going on by the main character was excellent.<br /><br />A lot of people seems to have a problem with the main character not breaking the cycle of events, but if you watch carefully you'll see that she does try to break the chain, only every time shes does try, it ends up just being part of the cycle.  There I've already said too much.
0446567337|5.0|Well, from the reviews I've read, this book falls squarely into the Love It or Hate It box, and nowhere in between.<br />For my part? I loved it.<br />From the tantalising opening, through all 3 parts of the story, I was glued to the pages. The first part is the happiest: John meeting Savannah and falling in love. Sweet, heart-warming and feel good, and then it all starts falling apart in Part 2. The final part had me filling up and in tears at the ending. I understand why Nicholas Sparks wrote the end as he did, but man, it was a tear jerker.<br /><br />John Tyree is on leave from his army posting in Germany, and right at the start of his 2 weeks break he meets Savannah. She's an innocent and utterly guileless, and John is immediately smitten.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; \\"I don't usually date strangers,\\" she finally said, \\"and we only met yesterday. You think I can trust you?\\"<br />\\"I wouldn't,\\" I said.<br />She laughed. \\"Well in that case, I suppose I can make an exception.\\" >><br /><br />The story is more than just John and Savannah though, it also charts the frustrating and uneven relationship John has with his father.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Savannah sounded a lot like the little voice that had taken up residence in my head but never bothered paying rent, and right now it whispered that if I felt guilty, maybe I was doing something wrong. I resolved that I would spend more time with him. >><br /><br />Savannah suggests that John's father may suffer from Aspergers Syndrome, a condition that suddenly makes a lot of sense to John - it explains the uncomfortable distance he's always had from his only parent.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; I looked at Savannah, then up to the ceiling, then to my feet, and finally back to Savannah again. She squeezed my hand, and I drew a shaky breath, marvelling at the fact that while on an ordinary leave in an ordinary place, I'd somehow fallen in love with an extraordinary girl named Savannah Lynn Curtis. >><br /><br />They are both distraught at the end of his leave, but at this stage, both believe they can sustain a loving relationship while he is posted abroad. They talk about being married and Savannah writes him the first of a series of letters that endeavour to keep their love alive.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Wherever you are and no matter what's going on in your life, when it's the first night of the full moon - like it was the first time we met - I want you to find it in the night time sky. I want you to think about me and the week we shared, because wherever I am and no matter what's going on in my life, that's exactly what I'll be doing. >><br /><br />They count down the time until his service is due to end. And then with bitter irony, three months to go... September 11th 2001. John signs on for another two years and ends up posted to Iraq.<br /><br />&lt;&lt; In the mail, there were six letters from my father. But from Savannah, there was only one, and in the dim light, I began to read.<br />Dear John. I'm writing this letter at the kitchen table, and I'm struggling because I don't know how to say what I'm about to tell you. >><br /><br />At this point, I had to close the book for a while. I wanted to yell at Savannah, slap her soundly on both cheeks and shout Noooooo! So their relationship was faltering, she might have thought it couldn't last, but to write him the classic Dear John while he's on active service and fighting for his life every day? How cruel could this woman be?<br /><br />By this point, I was too invested in the story to leave it, so I followed it through John's denial and heartbreak. Through the continuing illness of his father - and to the point where he next saw Savannah. I'd been looking for a light and fluffy read when I came to this novel - epic fail.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app. every morning to get the day rolling.  It seems as accurate as any out there and is really easy to use.
B007IUBU86|5.0|I have been an off and on fan of Dream Theater. I have never listened to Sympnony X, but will be checking it out soon, based on Russel's performance here. Do I love a good solid, melodic, kick-ass metal disc? HELL YES I DO! I did not buy the EP, but OMERTA is awesome! Adrenaline Mob lives up to the promise of rocking, good time metal. Undaunted, kicks things off with a crunch. Psychosane, is cool. Indifferent, is one of the best tracks. All On The Line, is worth the purchase price by itself. Hit The Wall, hits you hard. Feelin Me, is cool, but the F Bombs and other language  doesn't seem to be necessary, still cool song, just have to skip when kids around. Come Undone, is a very cool cover tune. Believe Me, another cool melodic metalpiece. Down To The Floor, will knock you down. Angel Sky, is the other ballad and a good balance to other heavy tracks. I love Feight Train, it kicks ass. I see some other reviews point out that Omerta isn't very technical, I agree. The band has stated it isn't supposed to be. This is a fun, melodic, grooving, fun, metal record. I wasn't sure what to think reading other reviews. Glad I took the chance. OMERTA is awesome. I highly recommend this disc!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book was OK after I got into it. It just wasn't my kind of book. I don't think I would order the other two in the series.
B0031Y9DCS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Down to earth, as it was. Deals with the difficult co-ordination required to fly a chopper right up to getting bullet holes in the machine. Personal feelings, friendship and everything in between. Real life that the guy doing the flying but not actually in charge of the aircraft is the guy who loses out on the medals. Some things in life suck, but that's how it is.
B006UG90RM|1.0|By far the WORST release by these guys ever. Vocals sound tired and old. Backing vocals, once a highlight of this band, vanished. Yea, Michael Anthony did more than just play bass. Album sounds lazy and uninspired. Sounds like an album of unreleased cuts that were not good enough for previous albums. They should have left well enough alone.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|MY hairdresser got her Kindle Fire for Christmas and at my next visit showed me what she had on it.  \\"I got Angry Birds\\" she announced.  So of course as soon as my Kindle Fire arrived, I downloaded the free version of Angry Birds and LOVE THIS GAME.  I got pretty high up on each level then got stuck, so also downloaded Angry Birds RIO - for 99 cents - and it is even more fun and also very adictive.  Great when you are waiting in a doctors office or just want a fun break.  Sure wish Kindle Fire (and Angry Birds) was around when I was commuting on the train to work.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|THIS WAS ANOTHER GREAT CHAPTER IN THIS ONGOING SERIES.  TWISTS AND TURNS WHERE YOU LEAST EXPECT THEM. I CAN'T WAIT FOR BOOK 6.
B00136NYR6|4.0|Not many surprises here. Given the track list, you know the main songs you're getting. There are a few good tracks that aren't completely overplayed and I like it. The price was great!

B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a fun, engaging puzzle game, with enough variety to challenge your wits and thumbs for a while. It's been my favorite game for a month now, supplanting Where's My Water as my go-to time-killer.
B000ME5B30|5.0|The film \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" informs viewers of what \\"Global Warming\\" really is. It is presented by Al Gore with intelligent, heartfelt honesty, a little humor and a lot of facts in easy to understand graphs, photography and film.  Gore covers climate and environmental changes for over six million years to illustrate in real terms how fast the current climate changes are happening. He explains why these changes are so devastating and exactly what is happening in countries all over the planet. he uses and provides evidence of scientific research, which you can find if you are willing to do the work to research his sources.  This film should be required viewing in every classroom, regardless of religion, political affiliation, personal opinions, or inconveniences.  This film is WELL WORTH the time to watch it. It exposes coverups by former President Bush and others. Get the truth, and realize what you can do about the very necessary changes this planet needs. If noone does anything, this planet will be changed irreversibly within 50 years. Think about it, many of us will still be alive to reap the consequences, our children and grandchildren will inherit the problems that we could have changed. Watch the film. Visit the website [...].  [[ASIN:B000ME5B30 An Inconvenient Truth]]
0439023491|5.0|This book is very much the second act in a three act story arc. Katniss's world of pain keeps getting worse and you really wonder how much more this girl can stand.  The books moves at such a rapid pace I was at the end of it before I even realized it -- mainly because I was reading the Kindle version so it wasn't like I could tell I was getting closer to the end. Fortunately, I've bought all three so I was able to jump into the third and final book in the series.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is excellent, I would recommend you read the first book in the series before starting this one. There is a very very brief introduction/recap at the beginning. But if you really want to understand what's going on you must read the first. Otherwise, you're just left wondering why is this girls life so jacked up. :/
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I feel this app is great. I use it with my kindle and it makes me want to keep up with my scripture readings. The plans are also a great feature.
0061438294|4.0|Since reading this book, I keep catching myself analyzing other people's behaviors as well as my own.  I've already used some of the ideas in my writing, and I'm sure I'll refer to the glossary to look up specifics in future.  Well written, interesting material, specific examples bring it to life.  Recommended for anyone who wants to learn how to make a good impression--or avoid making a bad one.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play it in my down time. When I'm bored I play. No bugs found in this game yet

B007BDK3SS|3.0|greetings fellow amazonians after spending the night in the jails infirmary I couldn't wait to get out. they told me that leroy was going to go to solitary for a long time for getting angry at me again. so I thought I was returning to an empty cell. to bad this place is so overcrowded when I returned I had a new celli paco. he was cool he was into all these extreme sports like base jumping, rock climbing and dirt bike racing.<br /><br />to welcome him to the &quot;neighborhood&quot; I showed him my kindle fire and then I showed him the faotd. boy did paco love that trial xtreme 2 was free so I let him download it and give it a try. I had told him I also had the winter version but he didn't seem to hear me. he left our cell and I thought he would be back soon, but all of the sudden I heard a scream from down the hallway. I ran outside to see what all the noise was about and there was paco laying on the ground covered in blood with a shank sticking through my kindle and into him.<br /><br />apparently a rival gang member had seen his arrival and knew there was a hit on him. once he saw that paco was occupied by my kindle he took action. now my only question is how am I going to get another kindle in here? thanks amazon for making me spend more money
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. It is easy to use and offers lots of devotions and reading plans. My only complaint is that it requires Internet service to work. You cannot access anything off-line.
1580176941|5.0|While I've always enjoyed cookie making and decorating around Christmastime, I've never really been pleased with the end results.  This cookbook has changed that.  It's expanded my cookie making far beyond Christmas, and allowed me to make professional looking cookies.<br />There's recipes for cookies and different types of frostings, sourcing info for sugars and doo-dahs.  Most importantly, it has an easy to understand and follow timeline for cookie making/baking/decorating.  Also has practical info on how to hold successful and fun cookie decorating parties and cookie exchanges.  Oh, and I forgot to mention the many many examples of decorated cookies with detailed instructions on recreating that cookie.<br />If I could could give this book 10 stars, I would.  I have many cookie cookbooks and this one will replace most of those.

B007BDK3SS|1.0|This game is awful, levels are hard as hell. Contols aren't easily done. Just not a good game. I would NOT recommend it. To anyone who wants to get pissed off easily, this is the game for you.

B000002I97|5.0|I have never been without this album since 1971. When my LP became scratchy it was quickly replaced. When CDs came along I was all set. I discovered John Prine and this album after reading a rave review in the Village Voice. Except for 1, possibly 2 CDs, he has never disappointed me. This album, along with Kris Kristofferson's debut album, stand together as the best I have heard in my lifetime.

B0067QPVD2|3.0|I purchased this Blu-Ray without having seen the film in the theater.  While the film itself is well acted, and the cinematography excellent, I cannot endorse it.  Being a huge fan of the John Carpenter version (and '50's Howard Hawks), this film had at least three scenes that were identical to the John Carpenter version.  Having the exact same title does not help either.<br /><br />If you do purchase this disc, I urge you to watch the John Carpenter version immediately following.  You will see what I am referring to, and will enjoy the John Carpenter version even more.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I had the vynal album since my 11th birthday. I played the cassette till it couldn't play any more. Now I have the cd. I had forgotten how good the songs are till I played it. I will miss her a lot. I think her come back would have been something to see.
1451648537|5.0|Having worked and lived in Silicon Valley since 1983, this book captures the spirit of the place and times. Reading 'Steve Jobs' has re-energized my passions for the insanely great products, productivity, progress and change. It is like Amsterdam in the age of Rembrandt where art meets commerce meets technology and brings together people from around the world. It's a great perspective and history of the last 30+ years. I've long had mixed feelings about Apple, it's products, it's decisions and it's leadership but as it turns out, who didn't! Many have a 6-degrees-of-separation story (mine are the Bosendorfer piano in lobby Bandley Drive 3 and a connection to Paul Jobs). Anyone who owns or has used an Apple product has a connection. Among it's many attributes, the biography is a great piece of promotion and I think I will finally get an iPhone.
B00006GFAB|5.0|The cd is used, but it plays well. I needed some rock-n-roll and this band is one of my favs. Give them a chance to rock your world.

1400049628|5.0|This book is amazing! First and foremost! Even though it is supposed to be a \\"what if?\\" situational guide, it makes it all the more a GREAT read. I loved how the guide answered questions that you would normally ask in any emergency situation. For example \\"Where would I go first?\\" or \\"What supplies should I bring?\\". The examples used are also quite enjoyable to read as well, like in the armament chapter when it discussed different tactics to use with each individual weapon. All in all it was it was well WORTH the price tag, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in zombies or into survival type books or more! I had a great time with this book and I know you will too!
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|This is a fun movie, and the director and actors did excellent work - as good as can be. The dialogue is suitably epic in style, but there is frankly far too little of it. I don't think we are so illiterate and so non-talkative as to not be able to follow dialogue. The show would have been much more interesting and entertaining had there been about four times as much speaking in it. The original Conan the Barbarian movie had lots of talking - adventurers telling their tales, the high priest working his deceptive charm and rhetoric on his acolytes, gathered crowds and even Conan himself. We people like talking and listening, particularly if the dialogue is epic, exotic, and makes you ponder deeply on the unsolvable mysteries of life. There is plenty of wholesome stuff heroes, princesses and priests can say - the writers can look up stuff from philosophers. The original movie was based on Nietzsche's philosophy of \\"What does not kill us makes us stronger\\" and was a pretty deep look into the meaning of life, Conan representing the Ubermensche (the \\"Overman.\\") Hollywood writers are highly educated in the classics and Shakespeare (even this movie is basically a mesh of the Odyssey, Iliad and Lord of the Rings) so I don't see why they can't bring more of their tremendous education to bear on filling out the dialogue with more interesting things than the occasional \\"behold!\\" and barbarian grunts. I hope they do make a sequel to this, but make it a much more intriguing tale, and quadruple the talking.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I love this product it charges all my apple products using only one charger and the adapter so I don't have to carry all my chargers with me. It also allows you to charge your apple product on cables that are not made to charge your iPhone , iPad , and iPod .
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Downloaded this a few months ago but just recently got it working. It didn't work on my Ideos, didn't work on my Galaxy Nexus, or my wife's Galaxy Y. It did finally end up working on my Ainol Aurora tablet.<br /><br />The app otherwise is just like the PC game, which I own on steam. Fun tower defense game. If you haven't played it I recommend it as its a good time killer.<br /><br />Five stars for the gameplay minus two for the incompatibility with most of my hardware and non HD graphics. Really Popcap is better than this. They should release a demo to see if it'll work on your device so not to waste your time or cash.

B0068TL23G|3.0|The game suffers from a terrible UI that forces you to undo five moves to correct a mistake you made six moves ago. Sometimes a hint, which is very expensive in the game economy, doesn't work correctly, but you're still out the star points. Or you might undo the hint and if you want to see it again, you have to pay again. Needs a UI facelift, stat.

So I am willing to turn to any resource I can find that will help me help my clients. This is such a resource. For me, I think the most helpful advice in the book is the chapter that centers on simplicity, as I have a tendency to \\"embellish\\" to the extreme and sometimes find myself in complications that could have been avoided. Having read this chapter (4) helps make me more aware of that tendency, and helps me avoid over-complicating my life and my programs. KISS complexity goodbye!

B0059XTUVI|3.0|Through a combination of excellent makeup and Meryl Streep's uncannily close impersonation, it's almost like going back 25 years and seeing the lady herself perform. If ever an Academy Award was given to the right person, this was the time - Streep absolutely clones her mannerisms, speech inflections and style in a way I've never seen anyone else come close. But besides the outstanding performance, the script is somewhat lackluster, deciding to take the career of one of the most iconic people of the century and focus on the least interesting parts.<br /><br />It's not that the script itself is terrible - it's better than many films I've seen in the last 12 months. It's more that it feels like a missed opportunity since there are dozens of events that could have been drawn upon to make a more interesting film. In making a movie that's essentially about isolation and loneliness, it fails to capture the sheer passion and depth of feeling - both positive and negative - that the average Briton had for Mrs Thatcher.<br /><br />Overall, I'd still recommend the film to people who are interested in the former Prime Minister but be prepared for watching something that's very small scale given the grandness of the times when she was in power.

0374275637|5.0|When you come late to the party, writing the 160th review, you have a certain freedom to write something as much for your own use as for other readers, confident that the review will be at the bottom of the pile.<br /><br />Kahneman's thesis is that the human animal is systematically illogical. Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.<br /><br />The first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow, applying human logic, we might reflect that it is probably Johnny coming back from the Girl Scout camp across the river bringing cookies, and that running might not be the best idea. However, fast thinking is hardwired.<br /><br />The first part of the book is dedicated to a description of the two systems, the fast and slow system. Kahneman introduces them in his first chapter as system one and system two.<br /><br />Chapter 2 talks about the human energy budget. Thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain. Moreover, despite what your teenager tells you, dedicating energy to thinking about one thing means that energy is not available for other things. Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.<br /><br />Chapter 3 expands on this notion of the lazy controller. We don't invoke our slow thinking, system two machinery unless it is needed. It is expensive. As an example, try multiplying two two-digit numbers in your head while you are running. You will inevitably slow down.  NB: Kahneman uses the example of multiplying two digit numbers in your head quite frequently. Most readers don't know how to do this. Check out \\"The Secrets of Mental Math\\" for techniques.  Kahneman and myself being slightly older guys, we probably like to do it just to prove we still can. Whistling past the graveyard - we know full well that mental processes slow down after 65.<br /><br />Chapter 4 - the associative machine - discusses the way the brain is wired to automatically associate words with one another and concepts with one another, and a new experience with a recent experience. Think of it as the bananas vomit chapter. Will you think of next time you see a banana?<br /><br />Chapter 5 - cognitive ease. We are lazy. We don't solve the right problem, we solve the easy problem.<br /><br />Chapter 6 - norms, surprises, and causes. A recurrent theme in the book is that although our brains do contain a statistical algorithm, it is not very accurate. It does not understand the normal distribution. We are inclined to expect more regularity than actually exists in the world, and we have poor intuition about the tail ends of the bell curve. We have little intuition at all about non-Gaussian distributions.<br /><br />Chapter 7 - a machine for jumping to conclusions. He introduces a recurrent example. A ball and bat together cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? System one, fast thinking, leaps out with an answer which is wrong. It requires slow thinking to come up with the right answer - and the instinct to distrust your intuition.<br /><br />Chapter 8 - how judgments happen. Drawing parallels across domains. If Tom was as smart as he is tall, how smart would he be?<br /><br />Chapter 9 - answering an easier question. Some questions have no easy answer. \\"How do you feel about yourself these days?\\" Is harder to answer than \\"did you have a date last week?\\" If the date question is asked first, it primes an answer for the harder question.<br /><br />Section 2 - heuristics and biases<br /><br />Chapter 10 - the law of small numbers. In the realm of statistics there is a law of large numbers. The larger the sample size, the more accuratethe statistical inference from measuring them. Conversely, a small sample size can be quite biased. I was in a study abroad program with 10 women, three of them over six feet. Could I generalize about the women in the University of Maryland student body? Conversely, I was the only male among 11 students and the only one over 60. Could they generalize anything from that? In both cases, not much.<br /><br />Chapter 11 - anchors. A irrelevant notion is a hard thing to get rid of. For instance, the asking price of the house should have nothing to do with its value, but it does greatly influence bids.<br /><br />Chapter 12 - the science of availability. If examples come easily to mind, we are more inclined to believe the statistic. If I know somebody who got mugged last year, and you don't, my assessment of the rate of street crime will probably be too high, and yours perhaps too low. Newspaper headlines distort all of our thinking about the probabilities of things like in and terrorist attacks. Because we read about it, it is available.<br /><br />Chapter 13 - availability, emotion and risk. Continuation.<br /><br />Chapter 14 - Tom W's specialty. This is about the tendency for stereotypes to override statistics. If half the students in the University area education majors, and only a 10th of a percent study mortuary science, the odds are overwhelming that any individual student is an education major. Nonetheless, if you ask about Tom W, a sallow gloomy type of guy, people will ignore the statistics and guess he is in mortuary science.<br /><br />Chapter 15 - less is more. Linda is described as a very intelligent and assertive woman. What are the odds she is a business major? The odds that she is a feminist business major? Despite the mathematical impossibility, most people will think that the odds of the latter are greater than the former.<br /><br />Chapter 16 - causes trump statistics. The most important aspect of this chapter is Bayesian analysis, which is so much second nature to Kahneman that he doesn't even describe it. The example he gives is a useful illustration.<br />* 85% of the cabs in the city are green, and 15% are blue.<br />* A witness identified the cab involved in a hit and run as blue.<br />* The court tested the witness' reliability, and the witness was able to correctly identify the correct color 80% of the time, and failed 20% of the time.<br />First, to go to the point. Given these numbers, most people will assume that the cab in the accident was blue because of the witness testimony. However, if we change the statement of the problem so that there is a 20% chance that the blue identification of the color was wrong, but 85% of the cabs involved in accidents are green, people will overwhelmingly say that the cab in the accident was a green madman. The problems are mathematically identical but the opinion is different.<br />Now the surprise. The correct answer is that there is a 41% chance that the cab involved in the accident was blue. Here's how we figure it out from Bayes theorem.<br />If the cab was blue, a 15% chance, and correctly identified, an 80% chance, the combined probability is .15 * .8 = .12, a 12% chance<br />If the cab was green, an 85% chance, and incorrectly identified, a 20% chance, the combined probability is .85 * .2 = .17, a 17% chance<br />Since the cab had to be either blue or green, the total probability of it being identified as blue, whether right or wrong, is .12 + .17 = .29.  In other words, this witness could be expected to identify the cab as blue 29% of the time whether she was right or wrong.<br />The chances she was right are .12 out of .29, or 41%. Recommend that you cut and paste this, because Bayes theorem is cited fairly often, and is kind of hard to understand. It may be simple for Kahneman, but it is not for his average reader, I am sure.<br /><br />Chapter 17 - regression to the mean. If I told you I got an SAT score of 750 you could assume that I was smart, or that Iwas lucky, or some combination. The average is only around 500. The chances are little bit of both, and if I take a test a second time I will get a lower score, not because I am any stupider but because your first observation of me wasn't exactly accurate. This is called regression to the mean. It is not about the things you are measuring, it is about the nature of measurement instruments. Don't mistake luck for talent.<br /><br />Chapter 18 - taming intuitive predictions. The probability of the occurrence of an event which depends on a number of prior events is the cumulative probability of all those prior events. The probability of a smart grade school kid becoming a Rhodes scholar is a cumulative probability of passing a whole series of hurdles: studying hard, excelling in high school, avoiding drink and drugs, parental support and so on. The message in this chapter is that we tend to overestimate our ability to project the future.<br /><br />Part three - overconfidence<br /><br />Chapter 19 - the illusion of understanding.  Kahneman introduces another potent concept, \\"what you see is all there is,\\" thereinafter WYSIATI.  We make judgments on the basis of the knowledge we have, and we are overconfident about the predictive value of that observation. To repeat their example, we see the tremendous success of Google. We discount the many perils which could have totally derailed the company along the way, including the venture capitalist who could have bought it all for one million dollars but thought the price was too steep.<br /><br />Chapter 20 - The illusion of validity. Kahneman once again anticipates a bit more statistical knowledge than his readers are likely to have. The validity of a measure is the degree to which an instrument measures what it purports to measure. You could ask a question such as whether the SAT is a valid measure of intelligence. The answer is, not really, because performance on the SAT depends quite a bit on prior education and previous exposure to standardized tests. You could ask whether the SAT is a valid predictor of performance in college. The answer there is that it is not very good, but nonetheless it is the best available predictor. It is valid enough because there is nothing better. To get back to the point, we are inclined to assume measurements are more valid than they are, in other words, to overestimate our ability to predict based on measurements.<br /><br />Chapter 21 - intuitions versus formulas. The key anecdote here is about a formula for predicting the quality of a French wine vintage. The rule of thumb formula beat the best French wine experts. Likewise, mathematical algorithms for predicting college success are as least as successful, and much cheaper, than long interviews with placement specialists.<br /><br />Chapter 22 - expert intuition, when can we trust it? The short answer to this is, in situations in which prior experience is quite germane to new situations and there is some degree of predictability, and also an environment which provides feedback so that the experts can validate their predictions. He would trust the expert intuition of a firefighter; there is some similarity among fires, and the firemen learns quickly about his mistakes. He would not trust the intuition of a psychiatrist, whose mistakes may not show up for years.<br /><br />Chapter 23 - the outside view. The key notion here is that people within an institution, project, or any endeavor tend to let their inside knowledge blind them to things an outsider might see. We can be sure that most insiders in Enron foresaw nothing but success. An outsider, having seen more cases of off-balance-sheet accounting and the woes it can cause, would have had a different prediction.<br /><br />Chapter 24 - the engine of capitalism. This is a tour of decision-making within the capitalist citadel. It should destroy the notion that there are CEOs who are vastly above average, and also the efficient markets theory. Nope. Theguys in charge often don't understand, and more important, they are blind to their own lack of knowledge.<br /><br />Part four - choices<br /><br />This is a series of chapters about how people make decisions involving money and risk. In most of the examples presented there is a financially optimal alternative. Many people will not find that alternative because of the way the problem is cast and because of the exogenous factors. Those factors include:<br /><br />Marginal utility. Another thousand dollars is much less important to a millionaire than a wage slave.<br /><br />Chapter 26 - Prospect theory: The bias against loss. Losing $1000 causes pain out of proportion to the pleasure of winning $1000.<br /><br />Chapter 27 - The endowment effect. I will not pay as much to acquire something as I would demand if I already owned it and were selling.<br /><br />Chapter 28 - Bad Events.  We will take unreasonable risk when all the alternatives are bad.  Pouring good money after bad, the sunk cost effect, is an example.<br /><br />Chapter 29 - The fourfold pattern.  High risk, low risk, win, lose.  Human nature is to make choices which are not mathematically optimal:  buying lottery tickets and buying unnecessary insurance.<br /><br />Chapter 30 - rare events. Our minds are not structured to assess the likelihood of rare events.  We overestimate the visible ones, such as tsunamis and terrorist attacks, and ignore the ones of which we are unaware.<br /><br />Chapter 31 - Risk policies.  This is about systematizing our acceptance of risk and making policies. As a policy, should we buy insurance or not, recognizing that there are instances in which we may override the policy. As a policy, should we accept the supposedly lower risk of buying mutual funds, even given the management fees?<br /><br />Chapter 32 - keeping score. This is about letting the past influence present decisions. The classic example is people who refuse to sell for a loss, whether shares of stock or a house.<br /><br />Chapter 33 - reversals.  We can let a little negative impact a large positive.  One cockroach in a crate of strawberries.<br /><br />Chapter 34 - Frames and reality.  How we state it.  90% survival is more attractive than 10% mortality.<br /><br />Part  V.  Two selves: Experience and memory<br /><br />Our memory may be at odds with our experience at the time.  Mountain climbing or marathon running are sheer torture at the time, but the memories are exquisite.  We remember episodes such as childbirth by the extreme of pain, not the duration.<br /><br />Lift decision: do we live life for the present experience, or the anticipated memories?  Are we hedonists, or Japanese/German tourists photographing everything to better enjoy the memories?was lucky, or some combination. The average is only around 500.

This read was incredibly thought provoking, especially considering that before this book I never thought twice about the validity of our free will as human beings.

I think that most people will need more then an essay to change their minds about such a potentially controvertial and life-altering issue.

Just because following bad advice enabled 37 Signals not to fail, does not mean it's the path to success.

After the first two days, my abs were so sore that I couldn't sleep on my stomach.  By Day 5, it gets a lot easier.  My upper body is very weak, so I had a hard time with Level 2, but I did get through it.  So far, I've lost almost 12 inches off of my body.

Even if you're not a fan of Apple or Jobs, it's definitely worth the read...even if only to gain some real insight about why Apple is the way it is as a company.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This superlative book, apparently required reading n some middle schools, set just the right tone - and suspense - to maintain genuine interest in the theme. Almost a morality play, The Giver sent me on to a book of philosophy about the moral aspects and responsibilities of memory. Recommend withut reservation but allow time for reflection after it is read; this book deserves it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love to play puzzle games like this. so much fun and challenging. I got it when it was a faotd but its totally worth paying for.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Good to see King back on track with his exceptional view.  I liked the concept and the idea that things could be changed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works great on my kindle. I have a much easier time reading along with the audio voice. It would take me a while to try and pronouns all of the name and now I can read along smoothly. I am now reading the Bible from front to back instead of mostly just the new testament.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|see title above.... cant even play... fix please.. needs fixed asap. will update review as soon as it is actually able to be downloaded and installed.
B00785P2QC|3.0|a lot of people have the same opinions as I. It's tedious tapping on a building every time for an upgrade, and you will not get anywhere quick if you don't buy credits. Some of the credit requirements weren't on so many buildings I could learn to love it more.<br />P.S.  I got so into this game that I went out of my mind and bought 115 credits to use. With 30 left, I signed on one morning to only realize my town had disappeared. I don't know what happened but I do want to give props to Amazons customer service for reimbursing my money when I told them my problem. :)
B007G92QGO|5.0|I recently started a book, one that I was impatiently waiting to be published for over five months, and it was a massive let down. I mean I was angry for a few days! I decided to come to Amazon and see what their top books of 2011 were, as I trust real reader's feedback. I started to read reviews and I picked up this book. I loved it!<br /><br />First District Attorney Andy Barber is one of the first on the scene of Ben Rifkin's murder, Duff puts the name of Leonard Patz forward as the man was accused of sexual assault on a minor before. However, there is a twist when Barber's 14 year old son Jacob is accused. Throughout the story many secrets are revealed and many more are hidden. How far will a father, who loves his son, go to protect him? As a DA he knows the judicial system is imperfect. How much is he willing to hide to protect his son?<br /><br />For me I really felt for Laurie, Jacob's mother. Landay created a beautiful, funny woman at the start of the book and as the story progresses we see her become a broken woman. This is not unusual for this genre but the difference in Landay's character is she never gets annoying. I found because there was little she said, there was so much more to glean from her speech and actions than if she had filled page upon page with her thoughts. I think Landay's style is very similar to Shriver's in 'We need to talk about Kevin' the narrative is exceptionally detailed and emotive. It is rich in detail and intended to be sipped rather than gulped down. I think that would be my only criticism, if it is even a criticism. I found I was so anxious to find out what happened, I was maddened at the pace at which Andy was narrating!<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book and read it in one sitting, much to the detriment of my college assignments! I don't wish to spoil the ending, although I will say this, when I got to the part about Hope, I actually stopped breathing for a second. The ending was not what I expected at all and it was through the superb craftsmanship Landay used to create 'Defending Jacob' that made this book so enjoyable.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Won't even download on my Droid X2. Never had that problem before &amp; had my fingers crossed since it said it works on *some* Droid x devices. Bummer.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|you can do your home work or different thing I think its great to have<br />and you need to get this app because you'll going to need it
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Thus game is great, just like winter. I'm just glad my stingy arse didn't pay for this after getting hooked on winter.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|good movie, great baseball movie, Pitt was very good and a true story of the Oakland A's and how they were built on a shoestring
B0042J6VUS|4.0|hasn't broken on me yet, but it makes me nervous every time I have to use it! made from pretty flimsy plastic.
B005I4NR1C|4.0|A good reading for those who have had some exposure to Physics and Astronomy especially at the university level. The use of differential equations to explain some of the concepts can be confusing to those with little knowledge of math but nevertheless the author explains natural occurring events around us in lay terms and does a good job.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I've been a Harry Potter fan for as long as I can remember. This, besides 4, is my favorite movie out of all of them. Definitely get this and part 2 to add to your HP collection!
6304884419|5.0|I think Robert DeNiro should have gotten an Oscar for his performance in this movie.<br />I showed this movie to my students in a high school health course (with permission from parents since it is \\"R\\" rated).<br />Groups of usually ebullient students sat quietly transfixed throughout the movie. Comments were universally good. More importantly, follow-up discussion often displayed thoughts and insights previously uncharacteristic of the age group. The developmental importance of this at this age cannot be overstated. (See \\"Forms of Ethical and Intellectual Development in the College Years\\" by William Perry of Harvard. What he describes occurs also in high schools.)<br />Even if you as an adult watch this movie alone, I doubt you will be able to press the pause button. I also suspect you will be recommending it to friends.<br />Sadly, Netflix, Redbox, and Blockbuster Express either don't have it or won't get it to you anytime soon.<br />It is not expensive and well worth purchasing while there are still copies out there.
B002NZTZ8S|2.0|I purchased this movie and it skips in a certain spot every time.  I sent Amazon an e-mail about it but I never got a response.  I do not know if I will continue to purchase DVD's through Amazon anymore.
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is not as bad as the band themselves claim. It is brilliant in fact. And who better to say so than a fan? It was the last Pink Floyd album I ever got into and it has become my favorite over the years. Weird folksy, pastoral Floyd. it very much has a definite pastoral flow throughout from beginning to end. Their music always had a homey English quaintness to it and it's never more clear than on tracks like Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast and Fat Old Sun. The title track is a masterpiece of orchestral funk. Summer 68 is a stand out Rick Wright song about a groupie encounter. If features some of Roger Water's most heart felt lyrics to date.  Excellent album overall. Highly reccommended!
1400082773|3.0|I just couldn't get into this book, but I feel an obligation to read it, so will try to do that this summer.
1612130283|1.0|Maybe as a former English professor my standards are too high. But I fail to see how so many people can give this drivel high ratings. Let's start with the flushing - yes, flushing. She flushes scarlet, she flushes crimson, she flushes beet red. Every time you turn a page she's flushing. It becomes quite obnoxious. Then there's the \\"Holys\\" - Let's see - Holy cow, Holy crap, Holy s***, Holy f***, at least 50 times per chapter. The Holys are exceeded only by the \\"Oh Mys.\\" Clearly this writer knows no other expression of surprise. I'm only halfway through and I don't think I can finish it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|My kids absolutely feel in love with this game. It occupied most of a road trip and added peace for mom and me.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I have watched this movie two times. The first time came at a particularly sad time in my life. It helped a lot.<br />The second time I watched it with friends. We all enjoyed it very much.
