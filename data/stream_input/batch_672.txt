B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I saw the movie the weekend it came out and I absolutely loved.  Hugh Grant has a wonderful voice and it's a pleasure to hear him sing.  \\"Pop! Goes My Heart\\" has an adorable New Order sound to it and \\"Don't Write Me Off Just Yet\\" brings tears to my eyes every time.  \\"Way Back Into Love\\" is perfectly written and sung and the rest of the tracks are just as wonderful and great to listen to.  I have this album on constant replay!
B00005JPLU|5.0|I saw this film at a studio screening in Los Angeles. Tyler Bates constructed a soundtrack that is as amazing and striking as the rest of the film.<br /><br />Generally, I fall asleep in a movie theatre unless the imagery is overwhelmingly spectacular. I was awake through the entire length - even the credits - of this film. 300 is the most amazing combination of violent destruction and graceful elegance I believe I have ever witnessed on the big screen. The damn thing was so intense I wanted to be *in* the film.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Well what can i say, im totally disagree with the 3 stars reviews and i give a 5 stars to the new album, i order the limited edition with the dvd and i have to say this record is awesome why? well, in the first record you have a pop-punk-rock avril lavigne, in the 2nd you have an alternative punk girl, and in this third record you have a pop-punk girl just like blink 182, she can mix all music styles without loose her punk image, i think the album is great is really addictive and contagious. Great JOB Avril, i really recommend this album...
B000NA1OXY|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD. I love Avril best, when she takes it slow on \\"When You're Gone\\". She has a lot of party tracks, but she should've also featured a slower side. You will love this to get your party started!

1582701709|3.0|Rhonda Byrne, the producer, behind the now famous DVD starring  Jack Canfield, John Assaraf, Bob Proctor, John Demartini, James Ray, Joe Vitale, Michael Beckwith, Bob Doyle, Fred Alan Wolf, Lisa Nichols, Rhonda Byrne, and Paul Harrington, has created a book version of this DVD.<br /><br />While this is based on the DVD that \\"started it all\\" there are actually better and more focused books on the subject of the laws of attraction, focused towards particular purposes, that come across with more practical application of the concepts.  Which experience tells me is the reason people buy \\"the secret\\"<br /><br />The truth is this is not something new and has gone through cycles of popularility over the course of the last 40-50 years.  It is in the application of the concepts, brought down to a practical level, that people will be able to find success using these techniques.<br /><br />If you wish to learn about the laws of attraction for a particular reason, I would suggest finding books on the subject matter you wish to focus on, as you are more likely to find practical application to the concepts.<br /><br />If you are interested primarily in learning about success I would suggest books by Jack Canfield, Bob Proctor, John Assaraf or Joe Vitale, all of which were involved in the creation of, and featured in \\"the secret\\" DVD, among many other excellent authors that break down the laws of attraction for specific topics.<br /><br />The books which put into a more practical form for specific needs/subjects in the long run are going to help more people, you will most likely get much more out of it going that route.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Reviews on here are not what I thought they would be. You can hear all the tracks on Youtube and they sound great. Sure, most of them are about boys and not needing them but regardless they are catchy and different. She has borrowed from Blink 182 and a little from the Ramones for the bonus track Alone.<br /><br />  I will buy this the minute I can. My faves are Runaway, Hot, I don't have to try, Everything back but you and Alone. One of the great things about her music is that every track is great and this cd is no different. She has returned to punk but still has some ballads, like When you're gone- which is great.<br /><br />  She uses the words Hey Hey a little to often but if you liked her other albums then you should give this one a try. It is a little more girly because she IS a girl and it's called girl power.
B000O178BY|3.0|I love NIN, and listen to Downward Spiral and With Teeth often. This new release is a bit murky, but something's definitely trying to break free of all that crushing gravity. Survivalism and Meet Your Master are the strongest tracks here, as is. The Great Destroyer hits a groove before descending into sonic Playstation battle effects. As Trent suggests, this will evolve with repeated listenings...but my best hope is that he'll continue to forge new relationships with producers (heard him on some NY rapper's release recently!?). Zero Sum, God Given (and the rest?) could stand to be be further transformed by the right remixer into something more powerful...
B000O178BY|5.0|Let me start by saying NIN is my one and favorite band of all time.  However, I anazlyze everything and when the Hand that Feeds album came out, critics ate it up...said, it was amazing and the best album yet...however, I disagreed.  Although I absolutely loved songs like, \\"Hand that Feeds\\" and \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\", along with a few others I didn't want to listen to the entire album throughout again and again.  Better than your typical album I was a little disappointed.  Now comes nails latest entry, Year Zero and I f***ing love it!  Trent is once again ahead of the game and comes up with slick, new sounds that will define this album unlike anything you'll hear this year.  You can't compare Reznor to any other artist and say NIN sounds like them, because you just don't get any more original or risky than Year Zero.  With 16 tracks on the cd, 14 of which are actually gongs, you'll get your moneys worth and be ready for part 2 to be released.  As for the people that say the lyrics are ridiculous and pertain only to the future, you should look around.  As Trent states everything is the album is exaggerated for the future, but is already happening now.  So in short, Year Zero is loud, it screams out and as you're bopping to the beat, you'll suddenly realize the deeper message deep within some of the songs, the message of our gloom, horrifying future, Year Zero.

B000002O8D|2.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is absolutely one of my favorite bands. They, to me, epitomize what Southern Rock/Bar Rock oughtta sound like. However, I am somewhat of a purist and refuse to listen to anything post Ronnie Van years (itssssaaaa SIN!)<br />My moms bought this album back in the day, back before I knew anything about Lynyrd Skynyrd. This was my first glimpse of the band, and luckily not my last, because if this was all I knew of Lynyrd Skynyrd.. I probably never would have touched them again. This disc is lousy.<br />The faults on this bit go on for miles. Ronnie Van must've been proud that he was being a tributed, but was prolly rollin' over to discover it was all a plea to make some of these survivors a little more bread.<br />They should have come up with a different name... like a tribute name... Kin-of-Skynyrd (I just came up with that in two seconds.. it wasn't hard) they vowed never to use the name Lynyrd Skynyrd again in the seventies, and looky here! 20 years later and the travesty continues... less than a quarter of the original line-up left... constant quarrels between members, on who has the rights to what... real great tribute. Ronnie must be proud.<br />Thats really not the main problem though. New Skynyrd sounds like a country band.. Real Skynyrd was not a country band... they were a ROCK band... and who has time to listen to the audience sing the entire Free Bird? Certainly not I. Go get ONE FROM THE ROAD live circa '74.. the only live skynyrd you need (good stuff), and leave this one for the other birds....
0743270754|5.0|I love the way Doris Kearns Goodwin puts into perspective all that is happening in the word and the circumspect brilliance and morality of Abraham Lincoln. Rarely was I bored; and only occassionally in over-my-head during some of the political machinations of the cabinet members. She sifts through the primary sources and draws conclusions that are personal, political, and speak of his legacy. All this while telling riveting stories about Lincoln and the lives of those around him. It took me a year to read, but you can put it down for months and resume your relationship quickly. I want to read it again, but who has another year?
B000NA1OXY|1.0|Yo, what it is, my righteous punkerz? I just finished, like, totally watching TRL today and I found out about the new album by the best punk rock artist ever, Avril Lavigne! It's called The Best Damn Thing because, like, having the work \\"damn\\" in your title is, like, so PUNK RAWK!!!!! It's good to see her fighting the good fight with other anti-authority anarchists like Simple Plan, Plain White T's, Fall Out Boy and Good Charlotte to keep hardcore alive! The punk rock nation flips the bird and spits in the face of \\"The Man\\" anywhere and everywhere, because we're PUNK RAWK!!!!! We're rebellious and extreme because we knock over counters at grocery stores and push old people around because it's fun! I hope they continue to kick sand in the faces of these moronic faux-punk bands like Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, The Exploited, UK Subs, TSOL and Bad Religion - TRL doesn't play them because they're nothing but a bunch of dumb boy bands! <br /> <br />I really love the song \\"Girlfriend\\" because everything about the song makes me want to kick the person next to me in the face and mosh all day and night! I love lyrics like \\"She's like 'so whatever' / And you can do so much better / I think we should get together now / And that's what everyone's talkin' about\\" because they're so deep and profound and, like, speak to my inner soul and stuff. My mother loves the song \\"Keep Holding On\\" which is awesome - I never knew my mom was punk rock ... even more punk rock is that she stole the chorus from a 30 Seconds To Mars song, because stealing is like so uber-punk rock! All the other songs are about Avril loving and hating boys, which we all know have been the primary components of punk rock since 1984, when Avril was born. That's right, punks and punkettes - Avril Lavigne invented punk rock as soon as she came into this world! She put on a striped tie and Chuck Taylors and the first word out of her mouth was \\"Punk\\" - thus it was born! How cool is that? Long live Avril Lavigne and REALpunk rock forever! <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />Ah, who am I kidding? Not only was typing like that difficult, but I think I lost a few brain cells in the process. Avril Lavigne's \\"hardcore punk muzik\\" will have the same effect on any willing listener. I pretty much mentioned everything wrong with it in the guise of high praise in the last paragraph - overproduced pop music masquerading as punk, bad singing, irritating hooks, and lyrics so bad and juvenile they make \\"My Humps\\" look like a work of genius. If that sounds like a ringing endorsement to you, feel free to jump in, but don't say I didn't warn you. I know that both Avril Lavigne's previous albums are Multi-Platinum so it appears that people actually enjoy shallow fluff - I guess ignorance really is bliss. <br /> <br />Congratulations, America - thanks to you, Avril Lavigne and her husband, Deryck Whibley of bubblegum pseudo-punk band Sum 41, have just moved into a $9 million mansion. Meanwhile, there are millions of people homeless and starving around the world. It's good to see that we are supporting people that have their priorities straight - forget about those who are less fortunate, it's more important to live it up, drink champagne and eat caviar instead! Because we all know just how \\"punk rock\\" it is to put material possessions over everything else in life. Right on, Avril and Deryck - rock on with your bad selves! <br /> <br />In summary: Just when you think Avril Lavigne's music had hit rock bottom, she puts out The Best Damn Thing and surprises us once again with her utter ineptitude. You people who still think that you're listening to punk rock should take a look at the \\"I'm so cute\\" cover photo, the lyrics of the songs (listen everybody - she's \\"precious\\" AND a \\"princess\\"!) and the choreographed dancing in the video - then you should realize that she's no different from Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Ashley Tisdale and all the other pop tarts. I highly recommend looking away from the Top 40,MTV and other outlets controlled by huge media conglomerates - they're just looking to push what they can sell to the lowest common denominator. I'm struggling to find even one good thing to say about this album, but I just can't. If you have money burning a hole in your pocket, check out anything else instead - maybe Joan Jett & The Blackhearts or the new Nine Inch Nails album for starters.
B000M06K5C|5.0|It's been forever since I've been excited about a CD. Not having heard their first album, I came to Bloc Party with just the two or three tunes they play on rotation on KCRW. Beautiful, beautiful, mature stuff. Anthems really. Plenty of that deliciously self-important post-punk. Layered guitar and lyrics resplendent with subtext.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show never had a chance to get started.  What a shame. <br /> <br />Only series tragedy worse than this is \\"Deadwood\\".  The loss of Deadwood is based in pure stupidity which makes it worse. <br /> <br />At least they brought back Nathan Fillion in Drive this week.  He's never gotten the respect he deserves.  Fine actor.
6305622914|5.0|This movie is \\" different \\" and great as a<br /><br />change of pace from the standard fare<br /><br />that is available.  Watch this movie and<br /><br />be totally engaged in a new experience--<br /><br />and have a great time to boot.<br /><br />Highly entertaining and I do recommend it<br /><br />to anyone seeking a good time movie.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I'm not one to run out and buy a CD when it first hits the stores so I waited almost a year to give Corinne a listen and all I can say is WOW! She has taken me through heartache, love, longing, pain, joy, sadness, happiness all on the same CD. I spent the good bit of a Saturday taking in this CD, listening over and over to \\"Till it happens to you\\", being pulled in again and again by the beauty and heartache of this song. Before I could feel sad for too long though she pulled me in again, but made me happy this time, with \\"Trouble Sleeping.\\" And then that funky...\\"Call Me When You Get This\\" made me feel all giddy. I backtracked to the second cut on the album \\"Enchantment\\" and the words...they stuck with me in the way her beautiful voice breaks from softness and explodes with raw emotion.<br /><br />This kind of talent to me is the epitome of what *real* music is all about, the ability to speak to the emotions that we all feel. She's done just that and more.
B000002U6E|5.0|This music will send you<br /><br />into realms of heart and<br /><br />mind perhaps unknown to you--<br /><br />but listen to their music and<br /><br />you can always travel there<br /><br />again.  Highly recommended.
B000002MJC|5.0|It is amazing to listen to this album from 1993 and see how truly current it still is....this album features every dimension of the Depeche Mode sound, from haunting orchestrations to soul-searching lyrics and vocals to straight forward modern music with catchy beats & melodies.... <br /> <br />In a time where every so-called artist sounds the same and is manufactured for quick release at your local Wal-Mart or other big box, bands like Depeche Mode stand as a lone voice in the wilderness of so much crap.  People think they know \\"modern/alternative music\\"? HA!  Depeche Mode invented it and they continue to re-invent....Songs of Faith and Devotion is a classic....best tracks include \\"Walking in My Shoes\\", \\"In Your Room\\", \\"Get Right With Me\\", \\"One Caress\\", etc....
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This DVD won't play properly in my Samsung HD-841 DVD player. It freezes up at several points. I would avoid buying it until they fix the problem.
B000002GB4|5.0|With the addition of Tommy Shaw to the band, Styx would ultimately go on to great success, and evidence of that was shown on this album.  Although it's not the best of styx, no Styx fan should be without this album.  Although \\"This Old Man\\" is a bit forgettable, the other songs on here are must haves.  T. Shaw's shivering \\"Crystal Ball\\" is one of Styx's most famous hits, and for a good reason.  DeYoung's \\"Mademoiselle\\" is possibly one of Styx's most classic pop songs, and JY and Shaw's \\"Shooz\\" is one of the greatest Styx rockers of all time.  It may be Styx in a small dose, but it may be some of the only Styx you'll need.  However, as I said earlier, you should buy this album if you're a Styx fan already.  Those who are new to the band might want to try Equinox or  possibly Paradise Theatre first.  And, as also mentioned, it's a tad short (only 35 minutes).  But if you are a Styx fan, you MUST have this album!
0743454537|4.0|I read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" on a recommendation, and what a great recommendation it was! I couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />It is the story of Anna Fitzgerald, a girl who was \\"genetically engineered\\" to be a bone marrow match for her sister, who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Anna has essentially spent her life being subjected to numerous medical procedures, some painful, aimed at keeping her sister alive. Now, it is her kidney that is needed. Anna, tired of being a medical guinea pig and wanting an identity apart from her sister, finally proclaims that she wants her body back and sues her parents for medical emancipation. It poses a thorny medical and ethical dilemma. Can a 13-year-old be forced to donate a kidney against her will? Is what is right for one sister in the best interest of the other? Are the parents so focused on the medical needs of one daughter that they have lost sight of their other children along the way? Is medical emancipation even what Anna really wants? These are complicated questions that have no clear right answer. I was riveted, and kept changing my opinion as I read. The story alternates between the varying points of view of all characters, and through this narrative treatment Picoult sensitively conveys all sides of a complex issue. No one is exactly right, and no one is exactly wrong. <br /> <br />I have read in other reviews that some people feel it challenged credibility that the mother would choose to represent herself in the case after not having practiced law for years. This didn't bother me, since I happen to subscribe to the \\"if you want something done right, do it yourself\\" school of thought. A couple of things did strike me as peculiar, though. First, Anna seemed too precocious for a 13-year-old. Her \\"voice\\" as written by Picoult often seemed indistinguishable from the adults. Then again, it's been a long time since I was 13, so what do I know? And I suppose she wouldn't have filed her lawsuit in the first place had she not been precocious. Second, there was a romance between the lawyer and guardian ad litem that felt a little out of place. Don't get me wrong; I love a good romance. In this case however, I couldn't see the reason for it. It added nothing to the resolution of the story. <br /> <br />I won't spoil the ending other than to say that I wished for it to end differently than it did. At the very least, I would have liked more narrative from the other characters about their reactions to the final events. The conclusion seemed so...abrupt. <br /> <br />I had never read anything from Jodi Picoult before, but I really enjoyed her story and found her writing style to be easily digestible. It wasn't quite a tearjerker for me, but I was engrossed and I'll absolutely be looking for more from her.
0812550706|4.0|Was it right or wrong?  Throughout the book Orson Scott Card changes the way you feel.  What once seemed good and light hearted later turns out to be deceptive or cruel.  Your impression of the characters change many times. <br />I am a student who has just completed the science-fiction novel Ender's Game, written by Orson Scott Card.  Reading this book began as an assignment for my American Literature class, but by the end of the book I was hooked.  I have been reading and analyzing books, short stories, and many other types of literature for a good part of my life. <br />Although this is a plot I have seen many time; an outcast who comes and saves the day, it still kept my attention and I could not see what would happen next.  He was able to create a set of events which are far from realistic yet completely believable.  The events in this story such as the outer space lifestyle and buggers have not been seen today, yet the feelings and will to succeed of the characters are very realistic. One example is in the beginning of the book when Ender says \\"I have to win this now, and for all time, or I'll fight it every day and it will get worse and worse.\\" (7).   Even though these children are in battle school and learning how to kill they still have moments where they are just kids.    After a brutal fight Ender had, he and Dink are sitting in his room when he \\"began to cry. Lying on his back ... tears seeping out of his eyelids and disappearing on his face. ... I didn't want to hurt him!\\" (213). You get so wrapped up in the story you forget how young the children are.   <br />Card's writing style is very unique.  One case is the way he develops his characters and plot.  Every part of the story develops at a different rate. At times this may cause confusion but overall I enjoyed his technique.  One of the reasons I was so interested in the story is because Card used literary devices such as foreshadowing and symbolism.  Many times card gives you some hint of what's to come.  Knowing this you want to continue reading hopping he is wrong. <br />People from every age group can read and understand the main parts of this book.  I assume it was written primarily for children, but the context makes it entertaining for all.  This is a book I would recommend to anybody, whether or not they enjoy science fiction <br /> <br />
0385340540|2.0|If you are looking for a suspenseful spy novel, this is not it. \\"The Broker\\" starts off intriguingly enough, with CIA pressure on a departing president to issue a full pardon for former lawyer and power broker Joel Backman. Backman, it seems, holds secrets to a mysterious and powerful satellite surveillance system whose origin is in question. He was hired by those who discovered the satellites (and who developed software to manipulate then) to sell their program to the highest bidder. When the government began investigating and others who were involved in the scheme turned up dead, Backman pled guilty to federal charges of possessing classified military information. Now, six years later (and fourteen years early), the CIA hopes that by releasing Backman and sitting back to watch who ultimately kills him, they will learn more about the source of the satellites, or at the very least, who Backman tried to sell his secrets to. Backman is released in the middle of the night and smuggled into Italy with a new identity, supposedly for his protection, though his whereabouts will eventually be leaked. <br /> <br />The problem begins in Italy. The story essentially stops; it's hardly action-packed. There are long walks, sightseeing, Italian tutoring sessions, visits to cafes, and long Italian meals. But one typically reads Grisham for suspense or drama, and it was missing here. I could have skipped entire chapters without losing any of the plot. There are subplots regarding Backman's communications with his son and a supposed romance with one of his Italian tutors, but I didn't buy either. In fact, I somehow missed the romance aspect altogether. I can only assume that we are supposed to believe it was a romance, since at the end of the novel Backman calls her \\"special\\" and we learn that he plans to return to Bologna to see her. Perhaps this is because I never felt invested in any of the characters. There was no character development to speak of, and I'm not even sure why someof the characters were there. <br /> <br />There were other subplots and loose ends that were never tied up. What of the Chinese assassin? What of the cash for pardon scandal? These threads went nowhere and were not resolved, or even addressed at all, in the pat ending. <br /> <br />There are shades here of earlier Grisham works. He's done the \\"man (or woman) on the run\\" bit before, in novels like \\"The Partner\\" and \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" I don't believe this story was as well executed as either of those. I used to love Grisham and have read nearly everything of his. The Broker was a fun story and I had no trouble finishing it, but it's not one of his best. I can't say that I'd strongly recommend this one, especially if you are looking for something in the action and suspense genre. As a more leisurely story, it's a pleasant enough read.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, given the cast and storyline.   <br /> <br />But it's about 45 minutes too long and there are many moments that should've been left on the cutting room floor rather than taking up precious time in the final version.  Unless you really love Matt Damon, stories about the CIA, or spy tales without the gore or action, you will find this movie to be pretty boring in terms of the time it takes to tell the story and general pacing of the main storyline. <br /> <br />And, while this is about the internal workings of Edward Wilson, the character played by Damon, you find out very little about who he is actually and why he did the things that he did.  Development of Wilson as the \\"CIA company man\\" is pretty standard or stereotypical, from the Skull and Bones club to the connections he has with important and powerful key players who would move his career along.  The last scene in the movie is telling (I won't give anything away), as you watch Wilson.  silently walk along the halls of the new CIA office he's set to create.  By the end you realize this is a man who lost much in terms of soul, his family, and his ideals in the service of his career with the CIA, but yet, after all that, he still manages to wake up again the next morning, dress himself in drab clothing, and show up at the office to tackle another day's worth of work.  But why?  The movie ends without offering anything substantial or insightful to answer this haunting question.  The relationship that he had with his father is important to Wilson, but the story doesn't develop this beyond tantilizing tidbits dropped occasionaly through the whole movie. <br /> <br />Finally, the movie squanders the talents of many fine actors. <br /> <br />Perhaps a sharper focus on the story line and a bit more action in the storytelling would have helped.  Yet, the movie is to be appreciated for the relative under-use of gore and violence to move the story along or keep viewers hooked.

B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor is a freaking genius. He continues to put out albums that build off of his previous work, don't stray too much from his forumla, and just sound simply amazing. Nine Inch Nails is one of those bands that could keep putting out albums that sound the same and it would still sound incredible. Year Zero is not a revolutionary or re-invention for Nine Inch Nails. Its quite simply just Nine Inch Nails 100% of the time, all the time, through and through. The bottom line is that Nine Inch Nails are a amazing band, and they know what they are good at. Thats not to say I would be opposed to a different sounding NIN album, but what you might call a standard NIN album suits me just fine when it sounds this good. That being said, Year Zero is a unique album and different than other NIN albums. Its a more abstract album than say With Teeth or The Fragile. It also has a more industrial techno infulence to it as well. But this is something that Trent as always experimented with, there is just more of a emphasis on it in this album, so thats why I say its not a completly different album. When you hear it, you know exactly who it is, its unmistakably Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />At 16 tracks, Year Zero is a long album, but its not too long. I find it to be about the right length actually, its the kind of album you can just sit and listen to it all the way through and then start over and do it again. I have to say that the flow of the album is quite good too, it never really seems to get dull or boring. The whole album is quite intense actually, much more so than recent NIN releases. Year Zero is much harder edged than With Teeth and seems to incorporate some of the older harder NIN style back into the mix. Its a good mix of old Nine Inch Nails say hello to \\"newer\\" Nine Inch Nails. Really good stuff from begining to end. My favorite tracks are: The Begining of the End, Surivivialism, Vessel, God Given, Meet Your Master and The Great Destroyer. This is without question some of Nine Inch Nails greatest material.<br /><br />I have to say that Year Zero did take me by surprise. I thought it would be good, but I have to say its exceptional. With Teeth is one of my personal favorite NIN albums, even if its not considered their best work. Based on my impressions so far, I dare say that Year Zero is a much better record than With Teeth. But with Year Zero only just being released, and having listened to With Teeth alot more, only time will tell if this album ends up being one of NIN defining albums or not. Defining or not, Year Zero is a testament to how good NIN can be and is one of 2007's best albums so far. Go get this album now.Inch Nails greatest material.

0618477942|5.0|I am not going to go into elaborate detail becauase i feel the other reviewers did a wonderful job. <br />This authobiography is done in her natural cartoon stage. <br />It does include extensive vocabulary and a plethora of illusions - such as to 'The Great Gatsby', Greek Mythology (mainly Icarus), 'Ulyssus', etc... <br />It is done in a moving way - one that makes you want to keep reading, while momentarily wiping the tears from your eyes. <br />It is basically about her life - how she is a lesbian and her father is a gay (though never offically came out). How she is manly - what her father is supposed to represent; while he is feminine - what she is supposed to represent. Though her and her father have this in common, they are not close - though both seem to push for closeness... <br />Her father grew up and lived in Pennsylvania (where Allison Bechdel was born and raised, too)in a small rural, homophobic town. He read all of the time - as a way to excape reality and fade into fiction. He was very intelectual; though often lead down many illegal roads - such as his fasination with young men. <br /> <br />I found this book very touching. The moral of her life is about how despite the walls that seperate one from their family, the love is there (whether it is stated or implied). Her father did not know how to be a father to his children, but instead lived through his historical restorations and his novels. She makes it avid that it does not matter what aspect took her fathers life (suicide or fright from a snake), she loves and respects him for who he was. <br /> <br />Note to warning, this autobiography is done in cartoon form - with some scenes being semi-softcorn pornographic (but it adds to the multi-dementions of the autobiography). <br />By the end of the autobiography, you feel like you are a part of the Bechdel family, understanding their strengths as a family while feeling their weakness of seperation and individuality (which leads, she so points out, to compulsion). <br /> <br />I highly, highly recommend this autobiography! <br />Worthy of more than 5 starts! :) <br />
B0007LXPBI|3.0|I vaguely remember the 1961 version of The Parent Trap. I say vaguely because that version of the movie was apparently as equally compelling as the 1998 version...which isn't that compelling. But...my kids enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />The movie takes place way before Lindsay Lohan's pics could be spotted...or should I say pics of Lindsay's privates could be spotted...all over the Internet. Lindsay plays (both) twins separated at birth by their divorcing parents. When the twins meet up by chance 10 or so years later they come up with a diabolical plan to reunite their parents.<br /><br />Anyone not familiar enough with the story has been under a rock...perhaps since 1961. Anyone that missed the movie deliberately because it sounds too cutesy and far-fetched has done himself or herself a favor. This is a movie for kids. Adults will be more entertained watching their kids interpret the themes in the movie.<br /><br />So if you're over the age of 14 and you've somehow found yourself contemplating The Parent Trap as the next movie that you just have to see among all of the other available titles...I would say that life under that rock has taken its toll on you in a most severe way.<br /><br />If you're looking for a decent movie for your age 6 - 14 year old(s)...this could be the one if your kids can handle a couple of smooches (no...none by Lindsay...Dennis Quaid gets a few kisses from Elaine Hendrix and Natasha Richardson). Oh, and I would be remiss not to warn, I'm not sure that the Speedo that Simon Kunz appears in for a brief scene is suitable for viewing by anyone!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Let me start by saying the Smashing Pumpkins were one of my biggest rock let downs. Their first few ep's and full lengths were amazing, I had such high rock hopes for them. Then Billy wanted to be Nosferatu from Salems Lot. I dont understand. <br /> <br />That being said, this albums rocks, Billys guitar tone is second to nearly no one, the guy totally tears the fret board into pieces in a beautifully drenched fuzz. The songs are well crafted, well written, well performed, and Corgans hurt little boy voice is perfect. <br /> <br />To me, the Pumpkins last great album, this is where their career ended for me. <br /> <br />Definitely a must have for a rock collection. If only for the mad guitar clinic Corgan displays like a $1.99 all you can eat smorgasbord.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Some doofus at USA Today said that Brad Pitt's performance in Babel was his best ever in film. They even put that quote on the front of some of the Babel DVD art. The person that made that quote probably just doesn't like Pitt that much and was making a statement of rejoice as Pitt's screen time is kept to approximately 20 -30 minutes of the total 2 hours and 22 minutes.<br /><br />Pitt's performance was indeed very good. In fact, I think that Pitt's acting abilities (not his looks) are perhaps among the most underrated in Hollywood. But enough about Pitt....<br /><br />The movie was fantastically entertaining. A single shot from a rifle intricately weaves together and binds the lives of 4 groups of players...3 of which are in different parts of the world.<br /><br />I have perused some of the reviews here that simply outright tell the story that unfolds in Babel. And that's too bad. Because I'm sure that this movie was spoiled for many by such reviews...professional and Amateurazon.<br /><br />I went into this movie as I do most: I base my choice on the trailers and the average \\"stars\\" or ratings that a movie is getting. And let me tell you that Babel surprised me. I thought that I was in for a Kate Blanchett/Brad Pitt fest, but what I got was a story that was much more compelling, complex and expertly told by a director with a very short resume.<br /><br />Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu gives us Babel like he's been putting out classics for two decades. But his first film that gained any notoriety in the US at all was 2003's 21 grams. So kudos to I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu...a director that now will have surely earned the status of making people attracted to a movie just because his name is attached to it.<br /><br />There are some stretches of reality in Babel. But I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu does an excellent job of keeping the unreal real. The main take-away is that this is a relatively long movie that keeps you in your seat without the desire for a break. There's suspense, desperation, thrills, high emotion and different situations for every age group and culture to relate to in Babel.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase.

0140143505|5.0|A friend of mine--who is always recomending books to me, told me to pick something up by Hanff--this was all the store had.  But really did it need anything else?<br /><br />This is a wonderful ode to books and friendship.  What more could I ask for?<br /><br />This is a series of letters between Helene Hanff and a bookseller in london, Frank Doelle (sp?).  Their letters span many years and there are the occasional other letters from some of his coworkers.  Hanff as a customer is very specific in her needs, she does not want books that have been trimmed by editors or poorly translated.<br /><br />Beyond her wonderful reactions to the books she is reading and recieving we get an interesting perspective on what has happened in England since WW2, its something that I was taught about in my history classes (here states side)  But something that I think should be.  I didn't know they were on rations for meat and eggs.  And here in this book we have a group of real people who had to deal with this--and Hanff in her generosity find great joy in helping out her beloved booksellers by sending them tins of meat and dried eggs (didn't know those existed!)<br /><br />Its a great book, and there is alot in it for its small size.  definately for a book lover.
0812550706|4.0|I am a junior in high school and was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to read the book, Ender's Game, by Orson Scott.  My college prep English teacher introduced my class to this book and I would soon find out it would be one of my favorites.  I absolutely fell in love with Ender's Game.  This book was not only filled with action but I was able to really get into the book was not able to set it down.  Another thing I loved about the book was I could never predict what was going to happen next in the book, as there was always something surprising to come.  **WARNING! SPOILER! **As an example, as I read the book, I could have never guessed that in the end, Ender would blow up the Bugger Army and destroy their planet**END SPOILER! **.    Some dislikes I had about the book was how hard it was in the very beginning to actually understand and get into the story right away.  For instance, in the beginning Ender was also called by the name of Andrew, which was often confusing to keep straight.  Orson Scott chose to write his book in the future.  Also, throughout the book I found it extremely easy to connect to the characters.  It seemed as though Orson's writing and his delicate detail of the characters made that possible.  His writing just seems so real and is so easy to read and connect.  In Ender's Game, Ender is characterized by Orson as a so-called \\"THIRD\\" who is transformed into a fierce and courageous fighter at battle school and becomes a true hero to most in the end.  Ender's Game is a book that most adolescents in high school would really enjoy.  Those who enjoy reading science fiction novels with a lot of action would enjoy this novel.  Those who prefer non-fiction romantic would probably not enjoy this novel.  Parents of those who are reading this book should be informed that it contains some curse words--although not many.  All in all, I loved reading Ender's Game and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a great book.
B000687M48|5.0|To put it simply, if your an Evanescence fan then hit the buy button already! Even if you don't own any of the other albums created by this this amazing group, this is definitely a great way to start your collection. I was really amazed when I first discovered this album because it is such an incredible deal. Unlike other CD/DVD combo's I've seen on sale, this one gives you something that's actually worth having. Not only do you get an entire live concert (from Paris) consisting of 14 very well recorded tracks but you'll also get a professionally filmed DVD (with 5.1  sound) of the same concert plus extras! Both discs are of such high quality that they could have been sold as separate products. The DVD alone could have commanded at least 25 bucks so they were being quite generous here. It really doesn't get any better then this, I've owned this album for a couple months now and I still listen to it constantly (even more then the other Evanescense albums.) I never had the chance to see this group live so the DVD was a great addition. You'll definitely want to watch it more then once. The concert is amazing and the extras are great (4 music videos and an hour of backstage footage, interviews, etc..)  <br /> <br />Other bands should really follow this groups example and produce products that sell live audio CDs coupled with recordings of the same show. Personally I think this would be extremely popular with fans and sell very well. Now what I would love to see next is a live audio CD and concert recording for Evanescense's 'The Open Door' Tour! <br /> <br />Conclusion: A must have for anyone who enjoys this groups music

B000059Z8J|5.0|WARNING! The Intergalactic Credits that \\"Superman: The Movie\\" & \\"Superman II\\" open with are waaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy toooooooo loooooooooong in spite of the beautiful orchestral score of John Williams (Jaws, Star Wars, Boston Pops)! That epic intro is more befitting of an over-the-top 3-hour 1940s Biblical epic, unless both Superman movies were combined into one geeky gratuitous leviathan (I don't mean to compare Superman to God but . .  well, actually, he DOES seem quite godlike!). Regardless, \\"Superman: The Movie\\" is a glorious cinematic experience on this widescreen dvd I checked out from the Ann Arbor Public Library (in case you're a spy drafting a list of my library lendings for Homeland Security; to you also I recommend this dvd and God help you protect our great nation!). This fast paced adaptation of Siegal & Shuster's D.C. Comics icon is packed with thrills, chills, excitement, humor, drama, gorgeous visuals and stunning special effects, and it's all rated PG! You can watch it with your wife, girlfriend, mom, kids . . . everyone is happy! Christopher Reeves tops his father's TV portrayal (George Reeves) as the hero, Gene Hackman is is always on the brink of stealing the show as supervillian Lex Luthor, and Margot Kidder gives the most blood-curdling scream to Lois Lane you could ever hope to hear in a non-slasher film (the helicopter disaster is great! who can't relate to a fall-to-your-death scene?). With cameos by Marlon Brando (Jor-L, Superman's father), lil' rascal Jackie Cooper (Perry White of the Daily Planet), and Glen Ford (foster father) as well as a superb screenplay co-authored by Mario Puzo (The Godfather), this thing is SUPER DELUXE CINAMANIA! I HIGHLY recommend it! As for this copy: mine doesn't seem to have all the extras other reviewers wrote about. I guess the proliferation of editions demonstrates the popularity and longevity of this film . . .
0805047905|5.0|My daughter has loved this book since she could barely flip the pages.  She especially loves the later pages, such as the one with the teacher and the page with the summary of all the animals that have been introduced.  As a primary teacher, I also have to say this book is a must.  The rhythm of the language is addictive, and it also transfers well into other projects.  In my classroom, every October we wrote our version of the book titled \\"Black Bat, Black Bat\\".

B000MXPE7O|2.0|What a movie this could or should have been. Just think of it, Robert De Niro in front of and behind the camera, Francis Ford Coppola as one of the executive producers and starring Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie. Honey, get the popcorn!<br /><br />At least that's how it should have gone. Unfortunately the recent '06 film `The Good Shepherd' falls far short of my pre-viewing expectations. It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine. Damon sleep walks through this 2 hour, 48 minute snooze fest and Angelina is delegated to the role of a long suffering ignored housewife (as if that could happen).<br /><br />Alas, it could have been great. Who wouldn't enjoy a good conspiracy film involving an all powerful secret society like the infamous \\"Skull and Bones\\" working their way through the highest levels of American society and politics. I sure would, have you seen one?

0812550706|4.0|My name is Tyler and I go to school in California. I recently finished the book Enders Game, by Orson Scott Card. And it is by far the best book that I have read in my entire high school career. I liked mostly the entire book. But it also and some down sides to it. Other than that the story was excellent though. The author managed to catch my eye with his style of writing and the way he kept me on my toes wanting more. <br /> Andrew Wiggin, also know as Ender, who is a six-year-old third. Thirds are the third child of a family and he was only born because the government told their family to breed him as a possible hero to save the world. People are talking about another Bugger invasion. A Bugger is a type of alien that has invaded earth in the past. And Ender must be trained to stop them from taking their planet. He goes through some crucial tasks and challenges to get himself ready. Overcoming every obstacle even when he gets bruised, battered, and almost death. As years pass ender starts to get frustrated with everything and wants to give up, but he knows he can't, because of everybody who is looking up to him. He makes some friends and enemies on his adventure to save the world from a take over. ***SPOILER***: Ender was tricked, while he thought he was doing another simulation, he was actually fighting the Buggers, and managed to do what people thought was impossible. He destroyed the whole Buggers race and he didn't know he had destroyed them, so he was angry about that, he thought he was a killer but everyone else thought he was a killer. Years after the war, he found a larva of the buggers and discovered that they were not going to invade earth, but they knew what ender was going to do so they hid the larva for him to find and plant. Ender writes a book about it under another name and after reading it people start to hate him for wiping out an entire race. But little do they know that he will be the one who gives the buggers a fresh beginning.***. <br />
0553579908|5.0|My guilty secret--I read fantasy. And science fiction too. I just don't admit it often. Occasionally, an epic rises above great genre fiction and takes on a genuine life of its own. The world of GRR Martin aligns with all our archetypes -- so easily we recognize the knights and plotting kings and queens and assassinations and even dragons -- yet transcends all of that and becomes a living, breathing world of characters that lifts it  on to a literary pedestal. Perhaps Tolkien achieved it in Fantasy. Martin certainly has.<br /><br />I tried not to like this epic. It's too long for my too-busy mind. There are no real wizards and monsters, except the kind who give you genuine chills--incestuous queens and murdering brothers and horrendous rapes. Oh, and the occasional \\"walking dead\\" and a few baby dragons. A Clash of Kings is aptly named. Five kings and a queen duke it out (pun intended) for a little piece of metal to wrap uncomfortably around their twisted little heads.<br /><br />This is Dynasty (the soap opera) meets The Lord of the Rings. And it's not to be missed by anyone who has the ambition to read several hundred pages of wonderful prose.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|My three favorite films from 2004, \\"Sideways\\", \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", and \\"Before Sunset\\" have a lot in common; they all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances.<br /><br />There are more similarities in three my favorite films - they all have characters I liked, I care about; often, weak and certainly not perfect; sometimes, confused and immature but sympathetic, and real.<br /><br />This is not the case with \\"Closer\\". My problem is that none of its four main characters was at least slightly interesting, appealing, likable or just realistic. And it is not the biggest problem that they were not likable - I can live with that and still love and enjoy the film. Examples - Nichols's own fascinating debut, \\"Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\". George and Martha (Liz Taylor and Richard Burton) were a couple from hell but like a theme song in \\"Closer\\" goes, \\"I could not take my eyes off them\\". I still remember Taylor saying in the end of the film, \\"George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad\\" and it was sad. I'd learned something about the characters that were deep and complex, troubled and disturbed. They were persons, the human beings, not the caricatures. Another example, Ingmar Bergman's \\"Scenes from the marriage\\":<br /><br />\\"Bergman and his leading actors Liv Ullmann and Arland Josephson give one of the most truthful, honest, heartbreaking and credible portraits of a couple, one of the most intense character studies ever done on film. For five hours, we share twenty years from the lives of Johan and Marianne as well as their love, hate, misunderstandings, insecurities, anger, jealousy, denial, sadness, pain, despair, and loss. We witness the moments of incredible tenderness and unexpected and shocking violence, both physical and mental. There are no depth that they have not descended in the search of themselves and the meaning of their relationship.\\"<br /><br />As far as a film about the selfish, self-obsessed, unsympathetic characters goes, \\"Faithless\\", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman could be the most similar in its theme to \\"Closer\\" and they both have almost identical twist plot toward the end. The difference is huge, though. \\"Faithless\\" has a high and unbearable tragedy that characters brought upon themselves, \\"Closer\\" is smug, full of itself and tries to hide its emptiness behind often disgusting and unnecessary dirty language. Did I learn something about four beautiful people in \\"Closer\\"? Sure. Dan's sperm tastes like Larry's but sweeter; Alice's c*** tastes like heaven, and Anna does not kiss strange men and does not understand why sex is so important. I don't want to get closer to learn all this; instead, I'd like to respond like Helen Sinclair, \\"No, no, don't speak. Don't speak. Please don't speak. Please don't speak. No. No. No. Go. Go... Don't speak.\\"<br /><br />Enormously talented and famous (and rightly so) Mike Nichols made an elegantly looking, well acted (Natalie Portman and Clive Owen are very good) and quite amusing film which is a screen adaptation of a popular play of the same title.

B000065V1V|4.0|Heathen saw Bowie enter the new millennium with a new-found confidence and focus. He (generally speaking) does away with the tacky production and lame guitar sounds of 'Hours...' and focuses on a more brooding, sophisticated sound, full of subtle electronics and warm guitar textures. <br /> <br />'Sunday' and 'Slip Away' are particular highlights, showcasing this tasteful use of dark electronic sound scapes in two amazing tracks that prove highlights of his post-70s career. <br /> <br />Unlike most, I find 'Everyone Say's Hi' to be a cloying, insipid, stain on the album, which significantly brings down it's second half. Well, that sounds very harsh...the song is tolerable, but it really does distract from the mood set by the rest of album. <br /> <br />The cover versions are all well done, but none are revelations. But it's the fact that Bowie seems comfortable, less self-conscious, and consequently much more settled, that gives this album staying power. Things are more concise, and the album is more cohesive than some of his 90s material. Apart from 'Everyone Say's Hi' the mood is sombre but still urgent. <br /> <br />An impressive achievement and a perfect place to start if you love his 70s output but have never delved into his more recent outings. <br />
B000NA28I4|1.0|I almost bought this movie when it came out before seeing it and I am glad I didn't buy the movie. We rented it and my 9 year old son is the only one who liked the movie. I felt that there was alot cut out of the movie. Didn't enjoy it. The kid that played Eregon got on my nerves, I didn't think he fit the part. Just very boring. I did think the senery was gorgeous though, so I guess that was one plus for the movie.

I LOVED them when I first heard \\"Images and Words\\" and still loved them when they released \\"Awake\\".

B00000255F|5.0|If you haven't heard BORN TO RUN, please God go down to your local record store right now and pick up a copy, because this I'm not exaggerating when I say that this just may be the greatest record of all time.<br /><br />The Great American Novel is the book, better than any other, that perfectly embodies the essence of America and American life - its hardship, its joy, its defeat, its triumph. You can think of BORN TO RUN then as the Great American Album. It is the culmination of the teen operas of Phil Spector, the rock n' roll fervour of Little Richard, the yearning loneliness of Roy Orbison, the incandescent soul of James Brown, the brilliantly surreal narratives of Bob Dylan, the streetlife drama of West Side Story, and then some. To speak of individual tracks is like focusing on a single figure in a great mural. Because as staggeringly powerful as the the crescendo of \\"Thunder Road\\" is; as much hope and raw energy are contained in simply the opening chords of \\"Born to Run\\"; as tragic as the heartbroken lovers of \\"Backstreets\\" are - BORN TO RUN is an entity unto itself, the place where the hunger of youth, the lure of the open road, the dream of a better life somewhere beyond the horizon, all the anguish and passion and promise of a final, desperate night, explode into glorious, all-consuming flame. Quite simply, this is what rock is all about.<br /><br />I first discovered BORN TO RUN just before Christmas 2005, and I was enthralled from the very beginning. But this last year my circumstances conspired to transform it from merely an awe-inspiring record to something more. Much more. I can only imagine what it must have been like to be there when this wonderful, amazing, awe-inspiring THING first came out, or, Heaven forbid, to actually hear these songs performed live by the man himself. Few rock records can approach BORN TO RUN; even fewer can equal it; but I have yet to hear one that can actually top it. Honest to God, it doesn't get any better than this.
B000HEWEE4|3.0|\\"The Lake House\\" is a romance in letters which is \\"kind of a long distance relationship\\" between two people that live it the parallel worlds separated by a span of two years and somehow connected by a time-traveling mailbox. If anything, this movie connected once again Sandra Bullock as a physician who moves out of her lakeside house to live and work in Chicago and Keanu Reeves, an architect, who lives in the house right now (the concept of \\"right now\\" plays an important role in the movie). Two begin to communicate via letters left in the mailbox and suddenly realize that they are as far away from each other as 2004 and 2006 are. If you watch the movie in the right mood with the right person, you could think of it as a sweet, moving picture about longing, about getting close to someone whom you may never see but not be able to get them out of your mind, and who become to you more real than anything you've ever known. You will see the gentle and intimate site of Chicago that you did not know even existed. You will be moved and entertained...If you are not in the right mood, you'd begin looking for the logical faults and plentiful holes in the plot and you would say scornfully, \\"another chick flick with Keanu as a romantic hero\\" - so, it is up to you.<br /><br />6.5/10

B000FDFVZ6|5.0|It is strange, to find a book like this. Heartbreaking, yet uplifting. Deeply disturbing, yet compelling. Sad, and yet joyous at the same time.<br /><br />This is the story of Susie Salmon, 14, who is tragically raped and murdered on her way home from school as the book opens. The rest of the book is about how she looks on after her death, and observes (and in some ways, still can affect) how those around her deal with her absence. Her parents, her sister, her little brother who was too young to really understand, her friends, teachers, schoolmates...all are affected, and all change as a result.<br /><br />It is hard for me to imagine how it would feel, as a parent, to lose one of my daughters that way. Would I fume and rage and try to exact vengeance? Would I suspect everyone?  Would I resign myself to the idea that I couldn't do anything about it? In 'The Lovely Bones' we see characters go through all of the above and more besides. Some grow together, others grow apart. Some cling to each other and some distance themselves. If this is a story about anything, it is a story about grief and loss and how hard it can be to face the sudden, unexpected absence of someone you love dearly.<br /><br />And an effective story it is...in simple prose and natural characterizations, Sebold really gets the idea across about what Susie feels for each of the people she is watching, and what they feel for her, how it changes over time. There is never a misstep or an overplayed moment, and there are some genuine surprises, magic moments I never would have expected but can now see were essential to tell the story.<br /><br />Simply, 'The Lovely Bones' is a beautiful story. Hard to read, heart-wrenching in parts, but well worth it. The emotions it subjects you to are honest and true, and that is a rare thing.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|It's great that Anchor Bay has released this edition of the dvd  because it was starting to become very difficult for people to find Phantasm on dvd.  Now others will be able to see this movie and remember how great it is.  The dvd transfer looks and sounds great.  Extras galore.  This is still one of the most memorable horror flicks mainly because of the strange story and dark characters.  It's a great film.
B000021XS0|4.0|My friends are I are big progressive rock fans. But whereas my progressive tastes tend toward Genesis and Yes, my friends are more into the band Tool. Which, I'll be honest, I don't really like. So I'm always looking out for new (to me) and different prog bands so I can expose my mates to them and say, \\"See? This is, in fact, better than Tool.\\" Since Tool is generally classified as \\"progressive metal\\", I thought I'd take a look at what is considered the quintessential progressive metal band, Dream Theater, starting with their 1999 album METROPOLIS, PT. 2: SCENES FROM A MEMORY.    Much as that term is reviled in critical circles, SCENES FROM A MEMORY is a good old-fashioned rock opera. The story, which revolves around a young man named Nicholas and his recurrent dreams about a young girl named Victoria, is told in the voices of several different characters over the course of nine \\"scenes\\". Even with its overarching theme, like many (most?) progressive albums, much of this disc is still taken up with showcasing Dream Theater's instrumental talents. But when you're this good it's almost a shame not to show off. John Petrucci is a technical wizard on guitar - he could probably make that thing talk if he wanted to; Mike Portnoy is every bit his ferocious equal on the drums; keyboardist Jordan Rudess is clearly a student of the Rick Wakeman school; and John Myung on bass helps to ground the storm raging above and below him.    Quite honestly, the plot of SCENES FROM A MEMORY isn't all that great, and since the lyrics are mostly devoted to advancing it, the words can get a bit problematic. But prog usually isn't about the lyrics, and the high, Geddy Lee-ish tenor in which singer James LaBrie delivers them comes off as just another voice in Dream Theater's instrumental assault. And in spite of the album's narrative shortcomings, there are quite a few good songs here. The aggressive \\"Overture 1928/Strange Déjà Vu\\" was the song that got me into Dream Theater (its reprise in\\"One Last Time\\" following on the mind-bending onslaught of \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" is great as well); \\"Home\\" and \\"Beyond This Life\\", both ten minutes apiece, are metallic epics; and \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is a wonderful, Pink Floyd-ish ballad and the song that convinced me to get SCENES FROM A MEMORY specifically. Not a purchase I regret. It's better than Tool anyway.
0374105235|5.0|This book is about the truely grotesque ugliness of man and a boy who through no fault of his own became a monster and survived to be human again. Everytime i see a picture of \\"soldiers\\" in some \\"revolution\\" in Africa, i now see terribly exploited children trapped in a seemingly unending struggle for power. Mr. Beah's writing flows like prowse and leaves vivid images of his culture and experiences.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|Incredibly dull and uninteresting given the subject matter.  Why on earth would you do a fictionalized account of the development of the CIA when the real story is well known and then make this plodding, vague mismash.  Matt Damon's worst performance by far -- he manages to have zero chemistry with Angelina Jolie.  Not even entertainingly bad -- just bad.
B000AARKO4|5.0|nailed his part.The drama of this movie will keep you going and waiting to see the ending. There is obviously a lot of violence so if you can't handle that then don't watch it.  Excellent movie even if it doesn't line up with history a bit.
B000O178BY|3.0|Nine Inch Nails is at its best when Mr. Reznor sticks to what he knows--his own internal life. This attempt at social and political commentary is ideologically unsophistocated, and, worse, musically unremarkable. <br /> <br />That being said--the album isn't actively *bad*. It's exquisitely produced and engineered. Some of the songs are even pretty catchy (I liked Capital G and In This Twilight). But it doesn't have that raw and terrible beauty that turned me into a raving nin fan in the first place. <br /> <br />What I love about Reznor's work is the noise, the energy, the exhileration and brutality that I associate with albums like The Downward Spiral, Broken, and, too a lesser extent, The Fragile. With Teeth doesn't have it. And neither does Year Zero. I'm extremely disoppointed.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|Children of Men--the story of a future society struck barren, the chaos that ensues, and one man's struggle against all of that--feels like a high-speed, thrill-ride through a dark, shadowy wood. It is something like a fairy tale of the old school variety; once Clive Owen leaves the path and wanders into the trees, he falls from danger to danger. <br /> <br />I am told that the movie is dystopic, in the tradition of Orwell, Huxley, Rand and Levin. I'm told that it has a strong political bent. I don't find either of these claims to be particularly true. While it is the case that the film is set in a future-gone-bad, the movie rarely stops long enough to catch its breath to develop any real philosophical or political messages, and that's what I find distinctive about the great dytopias of the 20th Century. They were trying to identify trends in society that would lead us all to ruin. Children of Men, on the other hand, introduces a out-of-left-field plot element to bring us low (making all women barren), and then just uses the setting as a dark backdrop for, what is, essentially an action flick. <br /> <br />Oh, along the way, we might argue that the film is in favor of, say, immigration rights or the legalization of marijuana, or such, but these do not form any particular, actual indictment against the society presented, here. They are simply little political statements included, as one might incorporate a product placement by having a character drink a can of Coke. (The reason why the immigration rights thing doesn't constitute an 'indictment against the society' is because it isn't clear that the government is wrong in what it's doing: given the barrenness thing, and if the rest of the world has truly collapsed, as is suggested, then England's immigration policy might be actually fairly sensible policy in order to prevent complete anarchy. It is hardly Orwell's doublethink.) <br /> <br />At the end of my longwinded rambling, what I'm trying to say is this: for allof its trappings, this is an action movie. It's a decent action movie, terribly gritty and high-impact, with a dark palette and lots of bleakness and paranoia. <br /> <br />While I respect the film, I didn't walk away feeling particularly good about anything (the name of the boat did little to lift my spirits). I don't believe I would want to see it again, and I don't think I would recommend it to you. <br /> <br />Three stars.
B00005JPOE|5.0|I went to see Amazing Grace with the teens of my church as a chaperon.  I did not really know what to expect with the exception that I was told it was about the abolition of slavery in England.  What a great story for all to learn that it was the Anglos in England who were amongst the first to abolish slavery.  It is not a story we hear much about.  Wilberforce got religion as they say.  His mentor, John Newton, who wrote the hymn 'Amazing Grace,' taught him about what slavery was.  In the theatrical version of the story, Wilberforce wanted to go into the ministry.  Newton suggests to him his calling is to free the slaves, to make that his life's work.<br /><br />Oh that we had such passion for the things of this life today.  I liked it becaused it showed about the potential in man to accomplish great things if he has a heart.  I am a believer in God, yet, not a religionist.  Religion, sometimes, causes more difficulty because it is so much like men and not like the God that it is attached to.  Wilberforce lived his religion.  Who knows though, maybe he was an enlightened soul, who really was against the crown, or maybe he really saw the commonalities between himself and the Jacobites in France.  He was able to hold forth in his battle in the Parliament.<br /><br />It is a story like no other in recent times.  I hope that more come to see it, that it gets its time in the media.  We never really heard much about it.  It is a story for everyone.  Historical, with a strong ethic for the love of mankind.  Wilberforce and his story will inspire people to stand for what they believe.  In the times we live in today, it is rare for people to stand up for what is right.  Wilberforce is an example of almost unwavering commitment to a cause.<br /><br />The world was better for his efforts, I think you will be better for seeing, Amazing Grace.  I am getting the DVD.

0307383415|3.0|Barack Obama is obviously an articulate, intelligent man; but his \\"story of race and inheritance\\" may leave readers scratching their heads at times. The story of his life, the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman who divorced when he was a young child, is atypical. His father, an extremely book smart man, polygamist, big talker and eventually sometimes embarrassment to the family who was known as the Old Man to his many children, seems an unlikely source of the \\"dreams\\" of which the title speaks. The author met his father but once, when he was ten years old. Dr. Barack Obama was already married (p 422) when he met his namesake's mother while studying in the States. He returned to Africa alone, married again (and again) and had more children. His mother then married (and later divorced) an Indonesian man and they moved to Djakarta, where he spent his early years until moving in with his maternal grandparents in Hawaii. He ended up in Chicago, where he signed on to help organize African-Americans to work together to gain funding for projects to improve the quality of their lives and those of their children. Three years and much success (after a bumpy start) later, he headed off to graduate school, but not before finally attending services at a large, popular, local church. Readers may wonder if, during the several page section rounding out Part 2 (Chicago), he may have experienced some sort of spiritual awakening: the signs pointing ambiguously to \\"maybe,\\" making one wonder why the event was included at all. The latter thirty percent of the book covers his first trip to Kenya (his father having already passed away) and his interactions with a convoluted web of relatives: aunts, uncles, cousins, and half and step siblings: the details of which, although unusual, will probably be of no more interest to readers than the tales of their own genealogical connections (a family tree would have been clarifying). Although Dreams From My Father is a good story about a smart, well-intentioned, accomplished man (with complicated family connections) who has lived an interesting life, its hard not to question his focus on his (absent) father in lieu of his mother.ll-intentioned, accomplished man (with complicated family connections) who has lived an interesting life, its hard not to question his focus on his (absent) father in lieu of his mother.  <br />
1573229725|5.0|I was enthralled with the book from page 1.  But what I really loved about it was the language.  The words lulled me into almost believing I was right there with the characters.  I got totally lost in the language; but that's certainly not to take away from the story itself.  The way the parts were organized, and then the big shocker--took my breath away.  I remember I had an appointment I had to get to, and it was just about the time I had to leave when I ended the first part of the book.  I literally yelped, \\"NO!\\"  But maybe it was a good thing I had to stop there for a bit, because it gave me a chance to catch my breath, and go back over what had happened leading up to this.  I couldn't wait to get back to reading it.  Anyway, I thought it riveting, and an excellent read.
0142000663|5.0|When was the last time you read The Grapes of Wrath? I myself had not picked it up since I first read it, more than thirty years ago. I remembered the bare outlines of the plot, including the famous last scene, but little more. This time, I was struck by the force of many scenes: the brutality of the tractors that tear through the homes of tenant farmers, the plain rendering of the little caf&eacute; on the road to California, the small luxuries at the government camp in California. The characterization of Ma Joad as she struggles to feed her family is unforgettable. Most of all, I admired Steinbeck's handling of tone. The novel interweaves chapters of more general socio-economic observation into the story of the Joads. These chapters are angry ones, but Steinbeck does not permit his anger to warp his story. A lesser writer might have sentimentalized the Joads, but Steinbeck never does it, and that's what makes this a novel you should pick up once again.

1579126227|5.0|\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" can only be categorized as a classic among classics. In 1920, on the strength of a dare, Agatha Christie penned a cozy mystery that introduced a grateful reading world to Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings, the detective and sidekick duo who hold their place in literary fame alongside such luminaries as Holmes and Watson or Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.<br /><br />Captain Arthur Hastings, a guest at Styles Court, the family manor of long-time friend John Cavendish, finds himself hip-deep in a locked room murder mystery when Cavendish's mother, Emily Inglethorpe, is found poisoned by strychnine inside her locked bedroom! Hastings, who fancies himself a competent amateur sleuth, suggests the Cavendish family engage his friend, Hercule Poirot, a recently retired Belgian detective of no small skill and reputation, to find the culprit. There is certainly no shortage of possible motives, clues and suspects - John and Lawrence Cavendish, the victim's sons who are suffering from pecuniary difficulty and constant financial embarrassment; Alfred Ingelthorpe, the blackguard, money-grubbing husband who stands to inherit the entire estate at the expense of the rest of the family; Evie Howard, Mrs Inglethorpe's companion and long-time family friend recently dismissed from the estate after a bitter argument with the matriarch over the intentions of her new husband; Cynthia Murdoch, the chemist with access to strychnine; or perhaps Dr Bauerstein, a renowned expert on poisons entangled in an affair with Mary Cavendish!<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable novel, easily read in a couple of sittings, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" introduced us to all the hallmarks of typical Poirot mysteries - the quirky, vain fastidiousness of the little Belgian detective and his love of method, order and the use of \\"the little gray cells\\"; the loyalty, charm, unfailing gentlemanly behaviour and decidedly humorous upper class character of the ex-military man, Hastings; the liberal sprinkling of clues and possible suspects; and, of course, the much-loved and often imitated stereotypical congregation of the entire cast in the single room climax in which Poirot outlines his deductions and reveals the culprit for the edification of all!<br /><br />If you've never read an Agatha Christie mystery, this would perhaps be THE place to start!

B0000041CZ|1.0|This is a passionless recording.  You could easily get the exact same performance from a computer.  Bach was a warm, inviting and hospitable person and this recording shows none of that.  If one takes the time to study the meaning of the WTC, one can easily see this aspect of Bach in the music.  The preludes and fugues of the WTC, not to mention all the works of Bach, have the potential to be played in hundreds of different ways so to tolerate a recording that offers the nutritional value of iceburg lettuce is silly.   <br /> <br />Moreover, the piano sounds really bad.  It took me weeks to listen to the whole recording.   <br /> <br />Another reviewer mentioned finding a recording on an instrument closer to what Bach had.  Not only is the sound closer but the tuning is more accurate as well.  Baroque tuning is a bit lower and when played in the lower tuning, all the pieces take on a much different meaning. Find a recording using harpsichord or clavichord.   <br /> <br />I threw this recording out.
B000065BPB|5.0|When I first got these I was a bit disappointed with the popping noises That suddenly became apparent when used with my Desktop speaker system. However that turned out to be the fault of the surround speaker system I had,  as plugging them directly into the sound card bypassing them produced much cleaner sound with no distortions.  I have to say I'm Extremely satisfied with these.  They sound so much better than the old desktop surround speakers I don't even use them anymore.  <br /> <br />I bought these for editing anime music videos,  so being able to hear the full spectrum of the music is important for synching the edits properly to the audio. These headphones are excellent in that regard,  I can hear things in music I could not hear before in other headphones,  thus allowing me to create higher quality videos.  The noise isolation is also good,  helpful for when my roomate is watching TV and I need to concentrate on the music to do my edits.   I would recommend them to anyone needing them for any similar line of work.  <br /> <br />Pros:  <br />Clear crisp treble and midrange.  bass is good,  though a little flat sounding compared to full range good stereo speakers (if you want to get picky), but without the rumble distortion you get from cheaper headsets.  The slight flatness may be a trait of closed style headsets.  Compared to other headphones these are still the best I've heard, Sounds even better than the $140ish Bose ones on display at Target.  Solid tough looking construction. German engineering. <br /> <br />Cons:  <br />A little tight around the head, takes a little getting used to.  I can wear them comfortably for long periods of time editing,  it just feels tighter than other studio style headphones I have worn.  Its probably designed that way to contribute to the noise isolation.  Not the prettiest headphones you ever did see. I value functionally over looks though.  <br /> <br />Other thoughts:  <br />I was recommended Sennheiser when I asked Audiophiles I knew about good headphones to use for editing,  and These Headphones have sold me to the name.  I will now recommend them to anyone who asks me the same.   <br /> <br />To those that are not getting the sound they expect,  Make sure your source is clean and the headphones are attached directly to the source,  or to high quality equipment.  They will show more flaws in the source than cheaper ones,  thus giving you the misconception that its the headphones that are no good.  Its the price you pay for Realistic clean crisp sound.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|CD Review: In an age which seems to display a notion that music is more about image over vocal strengths, Brandi Carlile is more than a breath of fresh air. Each song is a showcase of dynamic musicianship, from exceptional melodies to perfect harmonies. Her sound is smooth, confident, powerful,and achingly perfect. She exhibits dynamic musical instincts to punctuate the intended mood of her lyrics- smooth tones; swooping notes; heart-felt pitches; emotionally pure vocal somersaults; raw edges; and an occasional soft vibrato. Carlile always seemed to nail it! Lending itself to Carlile's credibility as a noteworthy vocalist, is decison to reject Protool plug ins while recording her music. These plug ins are widely used in the music industry to correct the vocal faux pas and sour notes of today's most famous singers. Carlile chose to demonstrate her voice in an unusual straight-to-tape recording, keeping authenticity to the collection. What you hear IS exactly how it was delivered in the studio, without computer trickery. This pure method of recording provided the timeless feel, that Carlile strived to maintain. Still early in her career, Carlile's vocal dexterity already extends beyond most seasoned vocal icons. \\"The Story\\" is a shining example of her organic musical vision, and it has resulted in a herculean outcome. The CDs many strengths should swiftly propel Carlile among the finest in her genre. She has abundantly displayed her worth as a singer, musician, and lyricist. Most importantly, she has assumed a position as being \\"credible\\" and \\"authentic\\" among her peers in the music industry, and by those who know her work.<br /><br />Song Review: \\"Again Today\\".<br />Don't underestimate this song! It has some of the disc's most vocally honest moments. The track begins as if the listener could be hearing Carlile's personal reflections, she asks \\"It's words that hurt the most, now , isn't it?\\" . Can one detect faint sarcasm? Onward, Carlile's vocal acrobats demonstrate a haunting poignancy, as she ponders \\"Whose going to break my fall, when the spinning starts?\\" It is her vocal splits and beautiful falsettos that superbly color these forlorn words, and would have left Roy Orbison feeling awe-struck. Each verse progresses, with a subtle tip-toeing crescendo...as if Carlile is leading you down the \\"path of least resistance\\" along with her...but don't be fooled. The climactic moment is an emphatically delivered protest \\"Not today...Not today!!!\\"<br /><br />Additonal Songs: \\"Josephine\\" and \\"The Story\\". I was interested to learn that bandmates did not realize \\"Josephine\\" was being recorded, as they practiced the song in one microphone. It is that actual one time delivery that made it to the CD...perfectly sung in one take, from the first note to the very last. Harmonies were spot-on, and \\"the twins\\" proved their harmonic aptitude. The title song \\"The Story\\" speaks for itself. The song builds in strength to what many consider to be among the best highlights of the entire CD...the final chorus where Brandi's voice cracks. Despite the slip, Brandi pushed forward and belted out the remaining lyrics. She made the decison to keep it genuine, thus the technicality would stay. She validated the decison by describing the vocal mishap as \\"technically wrong, but emotionally right\\". Others have referred to it as song's \\"beautiful mistake\\". The nuances in this CD, is what contributes to this very fabulous and authentic collection.poignancy, as she ponders \\"Whose going to break my fall, when the spinning starts?\\" It is her vocal splits and beautiful falsettos that superbly color these forlorn words, and would have left Roy Orbison feeling awe-struck.

B000G8NXZK|2.0|first off, the movie Brazil..aka the first disc or disc 1 is an easy 5 stars. i saw this movie when we rented it and immediately fell in love with its quirky weirdness.  <br />  <br />now i would recommend this set to 4 types of people. 1.) completist criterion collectors 2.) someone doing a research essay on this 3.) people who can throw around 50 dollars like it is 20...or 4.) someone who lives, breathes, and worships brazil and/or Gilliam movies. <br /> <br />otherwise, in my honest opinion, the single disc is all you need...it has commentary, a nice booklet, and the superb transfer.  disc 2 is excessive to the max...aka more than i want, care, or need to know...and the \\"love conquers all\\" ending thing could have been added as a deleted scene on disc 1 or something. <br /> <br />anyways, brazil is a great movie and worthy to be in any collection, but the single disc, in my opinion is all you really need.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was released in 2003 (I was 20 - the WB's demographic), and somehow I NEVER saw this show, when it was out.  Now, it's 2007 and I only saw this show for the first time, by a coworker's forceful will to make me watch it.  After the third episode, I was totally hooked, and am now extremely disappointed that the show only made it one season.  The show has all the makings of a great, original Sci-Fi - - - fun, interesting characters; a lot of adventure and suspense; movie-like graphics and storylines.   <br /> <br />I've found that Firefly is an EXCELLENT show, and it is now on my shelf among my favorite DVDs.  Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the show, I can kind of see why it was canceled: <br /> <br />1) Poor Marketing: I didn't even know about the show until about 2006 when someone told me how great it was - I'm in the WB's target demographic, and I'm not sure I even saw a preview for it. <br /> <br />2) Advanced Story:  There are some things about the show that the mainstream may not be ready for, or understand - ex:  mixed asian/english languages used, old western theme + space ships, and the existence of a professional/respectable prostitute.  Each of these things is explained in the story, but you pretty much have to watch the whole season for the explanations. <br /> <br />Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed Firefly, and strongly wish they would have made more, if not for the SciFi Channel, or for straight-to-dvd.  The story and characters are rich, entertaining, and suspenseful.  I would recommend this show to ANYONE with, even a passing interest, in Sci Fi. If I had to make a comparison, I would say the show is a cross between Aliens, Star Wars, and Lonesome Dove - - - odd combo, but well worth the time. <br /> <br />
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Cabin Fever was stupid and incredibly gross! After seeing it I told myself I wouldn't see another Eli Roth movie. Then Hostil comes out and QT is affiliated with it, and it gets all this hype. So I went against my better judgement and rented it. Thank god I didn't waste 10 bucks at the theater. This movie is better than C.F. but it still pretty much sucks. I thought there was only one shocking scene, and that's the scene with the \\"eye\\". The rest of the movie is just stupid. Like it was made for teenagers and it probably was. I mean half the movie is for us to get to know these college students. 45 min. into the movie I couldn't wait for these kids to die! Was that his intent or were we supposed to feel sorry for them? I thought it was a very good idea! Too bad it was Roths'

I was very impressed by the way the movie stayed true to the positive and enjoyable book, yet managed to surpass the feeling of hope, was inspiring, and had a sense of WOW... <br />This movie is worth a second and third viewing because you discover something new each time.  It had adventure and a story to tell -- and what a great story.... <br /> <br />Ciao
B000O75F7C|4.0|I have looked forward to the release of Fear of a blank Planet. Over the past weeks I have listened again to all of my Porcupine Tree records, admiring their development over the years. So why am I disappointed? <br /> <br />The band has grown to a higher level of playing. The song arrangements have never been so deep and layered. The 50 minutes sound intense. Gavin Harrison plays as if he is from a different planet. Richard Barbieri sounds like no-one has sounded before. And as a bonus my old hero Alex Lifeson throws in a solo.  <br /> <br />So why am I disappointed? <br /> <br />Simply, the songs are not as good as on previous Porcupine Tree albums. There are less creative moments on this record than on In Absentia or Deadwing. Composition and arrangement \\"techniques\\" have stretched the songs too far. It feels like Steven Wilson has either dryed up or has too many side projects (imagine this record if half of Steven's material for Blackfield 2 would have been used...). <br /> <br />And yes, I do not like the really heavy stuff in the chaotic way that Porcupine Tree now uses. The heavy riffs in e.g. Blackest Eyes were functional and enriched the experience. Here they go over the top and seem included just to attract younger fans. Perhaps this is my generation gap, but I have to sit through those parts. <br /> <br />I will play this record over and over again and probably it will grow on me, but for now I am disappointed. <br />
1400064287|5.0|This book is an elegant masterpiece of simple and crucial insights -- and it's a joy to read. I had assumed that it would be relevant to marketers and their ilk, but I'm amazed how relevant it is to me (as a university professor). I will use the book to improve my lectures, my conference presentations, my grad student advising, my scholarly articles, etc. Anybody involved in education will benefit from reading this outstanding book.
B000002H70|5.0|This is a must-have album. A wonderful blend of melancholy synth, driving bass, and lilting guitars provide the perfect showcase for Smith's voice. At times soaring, at others low and brooding, Smith grabs you by the heartstrings and squeezes. Sometimes hard. Sometimes soft. This is no quick listen - many of the songs are over 7 minutes long, ensuring the mood of the individual pieces is sustained, thought-provoking, and evocative. But more than this, the album as a whole works. Put it on when you have time to drift, be carried, and feel.
0753453800|3.0|This book is at turns dreadfully dull and blood-poundingly enthralling. Be prepared to plow through the mire of overly detailed passages relating tactical events to get to the great character-building climaxes. The people in this story were to me so much more interesting than the plot.<br /><br />It may be my own deficiency that I wasn't able to enjoy the action in this adventure story, but it seemed to drag on and on, and many times I had to force myself to re-read paragraphs to understand the development of a situation. When it comes to the characters in the book, however, I am transported to a movie set in my mind. I appreciate the impact this book has had on swashbuckling tales and our perception of pirate culture. For that we are indebted to Stevenson's imagination. I'd just rather see the film.
B00005NTJM|4.0|Aqualung overshadows the early Tull catalogue, and that's too bad because this first album is head and shoulders above a lot of the contemporary competition. The musicianship really shines, and although the obligatory drum solo from \\"Dharma For One\\" is tedious, it speaks to its time. Many of these are blues riffs, and that's why the album stands up over time. The CD is remastered and the sound is sparkling, a nice glimpse backward in time. Worth picking up if you never knew the early Tull oeuvre.
0142004235|5.0|What I want to know first is why, until now, no one had told me to read this book. If I could break the 5-star rule and give this book a 9-star rating, I would. It is currently, through the rose-colored glasses of my own perception and taste, the best book I have ever read. Steinbeck is my new favorite writer.<br /><br />For books of this caliber, it seems a waste to relate the story in some kind of abridged synopsis. When one says a book recently read was good, people tend to ask the question, \\"What's it about?\\" The better question for a book like this might be \\"What makes it good?\\" The first question forces the reader to relate the storyline like a plot-spoiling movie trailer. The second encourages the reader to explain why the story is worth reading while preserving the integrity of the book. After all, the purpose of the book is just that--to relate the story.<br /><br />I believe that good books entertain you, better books teach you, but great books inspire you. This book does all three. It is an ornate and cogent poem of a novel--relational, affecting, captivating. Every other sentence is profound. Steinbeck wastes no words. There is no filler--though the book is 600 pages--and not once did I feel as though I were working to get through it. The writing is absorbing and the content stirring, heart and mind.<br /><br />For the first time in a long career of novel consumption, I did not binge on this book. It was so spectacular that I forced myself to moderate how much I read in a sitting. This is a filet mignon of a novel. Read it. Savor it. Tell someone else to do the same.
B000O178BY|2.0|This cd takes the worst parts of The Fragile and the worst parts of Pretty Hate Machine and combines them to create a mediocre concept album. Now I'm no Nine Inch Nails basher, but this cd doesn't have much going for it. The concept is alright, but the music doesn't stand out or provide enough oomph to make the cd enjoyable. The Fragile was filled with tracks that had no lyrics and no real concept, but they were broken up with great tracks like We're In This Together Now and Starf***er. This cd takes that idea, with an entirely different concept, and doesn't deliver on anything memorable both musically or lyrically.  NIN's last two albums, With Teeth and Year Zero, show Trent Reznor treading water. It seems as if he has become a parody of himself. This cd isn't horrible, but it is not even close to being as good as The Downward Spiral or The Fragile.
B00005JPCF|1.0|Wow.  I can't believe the ratings on this.  I do not do many reviews, but I feel I have to on this one.  Ok the movie had nice animation (it won the Academy Award), but I could count on one hand the amount of times I or the theater audience laughed.  Yes, the plot was semi-cute but contrary to so many other reviews, that was not enough to make this a good film.  Overall the movie was really incomprehensible.  Even my kids were confused and spent most of the movie feeling sad.  But I guess that was the intention.  It was an obvious political movie that was created to inspire sadness in children about the environment, display fathers in a bad light, encourage laughter at people who are mentally challenged, and further racist stereotypes towards people of Latin descent.  Think I am crazy?  Read on...  The whole concept of &#34;Happy Feet&#34; is a penguin named Mumbles (he does not mumble- so no idea why he has that name), that can dance, but can't sing as others of his species can.  Singing is essential in order to attract a mate.  Dancing is considered an abnormal vulgar behavior, and is rejected by everyone.  He is treated as an outcast (due to his inability to get a mate) by not only the community, but his father and must even give up his one friend/potential girlfriend due to his mating imperfection.  About Fathers: So how did this happen to him?  Well his father was a fun loving &#34;hippie&#34; penguin who, as a result of being too happy or ADD, drops his son's egg.  The egg rolls away into the snow from him long enough to cause developmental problems in his son (which he refuses to admit may be his fault until way later).  About Mental Retardation:  The animators go out of their way to show how mentally handicapped Mumbles is and humiliate him constantly even though he seems to not realize it.  In other words the character acts like a slightly mentally challenged person who keeps singing away, dancing and smiling all the while as if everything is ok, even though he was told he can't sing (believe me it is painful) and dancing is abnormal, even considered vulgar by much of the community. The animators even made this penguin look different with more white fur around the head than others making him look like he has down syndrome.  About Racism: This movie is offensive to all people of Latin descent.  Robin Williams (and others I assume) portray a group of penguins that sound and act like lowlife street thugs, unfortunately but very clearly of Mexican descent.  These characters offered some comic relief to an overall sad movie, but the reason for the portrayal of Latino penguins from the other side of town really makes no sense at all.  Penguins with a Mexican accent?  It was pointless.  The way this movie wraps up is too quick, extremely political, and most definitely pot-inspired.  This is not a kids movie.  This is not even an adult movie.  This is garbage.
B000LPS47U|4.0|Anchor bay makes some fantastic DVD editions of classic horrors, for a great price.  Their Necronomicon editions of the Evil Dead films, as well as their special editions of Dawn of the Dead and Suspira are worth every penny. <br /> <br />I was a bit disappointed to see this new edition of Re-Animator only because it's the third special edition, and it doesn't contain much that the others don't (just one featurette).  The addition of the limited edition syringe hilighter is a great idea, and it looks really funky.   <br /> <br />However, inside the box the DVDs are in a standard plastic keep case, which I happen to hate.  I'd rather have the cardboard folder packaging than a plastic keepcase, which looks so cheap. At least with the cardboard CD cases, you get an all over full colour print, without the plastic covering.   <br /> <br />Also, there are no inserts inside the package save for a single slip of cardstock with a print on one side, and the chapters on the other.  If you want to keep the higlighter with the DVD, you have to keep them both in the box. It's not a flip cover DVD box either - just a regular box that crushes easily. <br /> <br />The movie, if you are a fan, remains fantastic.  The commentary (which has appeared on three versions to date) is very good - I liked comparing the director's point of view, with the experiences of the actors.  The three principles clearly had a great time working together, and they have plenty to say about the making of the film.   <br /> <br />There has only been one special edition of Bride of Re-Animator that I'm aware of, and I missed getting a copy when it was released a few years ago.  Now that the first film has been released again in a special edition package, I'm very hopeful that we'll see a better edition of Bride than the bare bones one currently available.  That's really the most exciting part of this new release.   <br />
B000JSI7AI|5.0|Okay....so I'm not going to dig deep into this film, other's have already done that, successfully I might add!  I'm in love with this movie!  I've been a Heath Ledger fan for quite some time and have a big handful of his other movies in my DVD collection.  It was Jake Gyllenhaal with whom I was not familiar with.  I sure know who he is now!  What a gorgeous guy!  His eyes, lips and smile are phenomenal!  A pure pleasure to watch on-screen.  I've watched and watched and watched Brokeback....at least 40 times, if not more, and I never tire of it.  It has to be viewed with and open mind and heart....and it helps if you're already okay with the genre.  It's too bad Jack had to die in the end....a second movie would have been nice.  I hope in the future Heath and Jake would make more movies together....they're good friends in real life....I think their fan's would love it!
B000MXPE7O|3.0|My title says it all really.  The acting in this spy \\"thriller\\" is great.  Everyone does a wonderful job.  The directing is ok for a spy film, however, I wouldn't say it's that great.  The film suffers from a clunky script.  It asks the viewer to be a spy.  To try to piece together a puzzle that can't be solved unless you're a counter-intelligence agent.   <br /> <br />See it for some interesting theories in history, but try to stay awake.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie stands alone. There had been other puppet movies before, Notably those of Bill Baird.  But Jim Henson went as far beyond Bill Baird as Werner Von Braun had gone beyond Leonardo Da Vinci. <br />The movie is basically a children's story, but like some of Tolkien's work, to which it could be compared, it has depths that make it enjoyable to adults as well.  A real gem for the whole family. <br />The \\"making Of\\" featurette is well worth watching for any fan of fantasy films and should be \\"must view\\" for any one wanting to produce or direct anything in that genre.
B000G75AE8|3.0|Ah, Slayer....such fond memories of my flaming youth. Slayer was certainly the heaviest and one of the most influential of the Bay area thrash scene, and have authored some of the most classic metal albums ever written- their contribution to metal can't be denied....I was very excited after learning that Slayer had a new album coming out after many years of silence, and also that Dave Lombardo had returned to the drum kit.<br /><br />That having been said, after listening to the new material, one can't help wonder if Slayer is really relevant. Yes, it's heavy, yes, it's agressive and evil (it wouldn't be Slayer otherwise), but don't excpect some sort of intelligent social commentary or new more \\"activist\\" Slayer, like some have claimed. Most of the lyrical content is almost childishly offensive and rudimentary. (At one point Tom Araya shrieks \\"Hail Satan!\\") Now, I wouldn't have it any other way...I just think that one shouldn't expect a \\"21st century\\" Slayer. They do sing about terrorism (\\"Jihad\\"), but it's just used as grist for the ol' Slayer lyric mill, not to inform or enlighten.<br /><br /> Slayer does what they do, and for the fans that is always a good thing.  Hannemann and King maul their skull-covered guitars with mechanical, teutonic efficiency, Araya yells as fast as he can, Lombardo systematically pummels his drums. Fun stuff, meng. Is it as good as uber-classics like \\"Reign In Blood\\" or \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\"? Not really. But for old-school fans of Slayer, it certainly is enough.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|for the opening sequence(s) alone. Not only does it deliver the greatest chase scene I've ever seen, but believe it or not, it's a foot chase.  <br /> <br />Craig is very promising as the new Bond, but how the new direction holds up, is anyone's guess. As much as I'm a fan of the Bond franchise, I'll be the first to admit that they often don't seem to know where they're taking him. Brosnan was great in Goldeneye, but the next 3? <br /> <br />Regardless of where they take the re-booted Bond, this is one of the best of the Bond adventures. It's up there with Connery's catalog and the best of Moore's outings.

0140177396|5.0|I'm not a big fan of sentimental moments and happy endings, which is one of the reasons I like 'Of Mice and Men' so much.  It's a tragedy, a bleak one at that, but it's also a deeply affecting novel that will stay with you long after you've read it.<br /><br />This is a short but powerful novel about lonely people, desperately clinging to their dreams, even if they know deep down that they will never come true.  Without dreams, they have nothing.  The novel speaks to the emptiness that people feel in the absence of genuine friendship and how people will settle for whatever human companionship they find in order to fill the void.<br /><br />In 'Of Mice and Men' Steinbeck has given us some of the most memorable characters in modern literature.  The novel is deeply affecting without being overwrought or overly sentimental.  Virtually all of the characters are lonely and desperate for companionship, but even so, given the opportunity they will seek out those who are lonelier or weaker than themselves and torment them as much as possible.<br /><br />The foreshadowing that Steinbeck uses is very efective in the novel.  The difficult decision that George must make at the end of the novel is similar to a choice that Candy is unable to make earlier, a decision the old man later regrets.<br /><br />'Of Mice and Men' may not be the \\"feel good novel of the year\\" (of any year) but it is an extraordinary piece of fiction and one of the best novels of the 20th century.  I highly recommend this novel (unless you're a sucker for happy endings).
0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki tells the story of his two 'dads'.  One is his real father, his poor dad, who struggles with money issues.  The other dad, his rich dad, is actually the father of his friend, Mike.     Kiyosaki's poor dad is highly educated, holds an excellent job, and struggles with finances all of his life.   Rich dad never finished his public education, lives very modestly, owns a number of companies, and is one of the richest men in Hawaii.  Kiyosaki, along with his friend, Mike, at the age of 9, asks rich dad how to become rich.  This book is the story of how rich dad instructs Kiyosaki and his friend, and of rich dad's philosophies on how to handle money.      There are allegations on the net that state that rich dad does not exist, that Kiyosaki made him up.  If true, that is disturbing.  After all, the implication is that these philosophies are validated by rich dad's using them to secure his wealth.  The book never once hints that rich dad is nothing more then a vehicle used to make a point through story telling.  It's rather deceptive, if the allegations are true.    Unfortunately, the title of the book is also misleading. He states that the book tells you \\"what the rich teach their kids about money that the poor and middle class do not\\". There are no \\"secrets\\" here, no revelations.  In fact, there is nothing here that even requires the right education, or special talents, or even intelligence.  The ideas presented are, basically, born of simple common sense.  Some of his teachings are: educate yourself in accounting/investing/financing - set-up a corporation for tax benefits - invest in assets with your income - do not allow fear to make decisions for you - hire well educated, experienced, intelligent advisors - reduce your expenses - do not buy luxuries on credit - do not live the high-life and spend all that you earn.     There is no technical information in this book.  If you pick it up and read it with the belief that there will be tips (secrets) on how to invest and handle your money, you will be disappointed. There is a good deal of Kiyosaki promoting his other products, such a game which sells for a $195.00. There is also a lot of fluff and story telling in the book.  My guess is that Kiyosaki needed to fill the pages and hold the attention of his readers.  He sure knows how to go on endlessly in order to make a simple point.    He also is rather insulting to employees.  At one point in the book, he refers to them as \\"hamsters\\".  I hate to tell Kiyosaki this, but there is nothing wrong with being a \\"hamster\\", or a \\"donkey\\" (another word he uses to describe employees). Corporations and companies are built on the work of their \\"hamsters and donkies\\" - without them, there would be no corporation and/or company. But, to Kiyosaki's defense, he does point out that employers only pay what they must in order to keep their employees working there.  He does point out how much employees are used for the benefit of the employer (through their hard work), the government (in the form of taxes), and the banks (in the form of high interest rate loans such as mortgages and credit cards).  This shouldn't be surprising either.  We do live in a capitalistic society.    And yes, Kiyosaki, the middle class does indeed pay the balance of the rich's taxes and thus, the rich do not pay their fair share.  The rich are in a position of financial means to make use of numerous loopholes that have been created for their benefit.  The rich jump down the loopholes while the government goes and collects its taxes from who it can - if Uncle Sam can't get the money from the rich, it just collects it from the middle class.     Yes, I agree - the middle class should financially educate themselves. And I also agree that the public schools are painfully lacking in teaching this particular area of study.  But education alone is not enough to gain wealth.  Education is not the only factor involved.  Kiyosaki makes it sound all so simple at times.  It's not.Kiyosaki has, what I call, the typical corporate mind-set:  Hey!  I'm just minding my own business and doing what is perfectly legal.  It's everyone else's fault that they aren't rich too.    Kiyosaki has not too many problems with greed.  Perhaps this attitude is what is necessary to become one of the wealthy.      I am not one for motivational books.  After all, the motivation to get off your duff and do something about your financial situation comes from within.  It does not come from the pages of a book.  I have now read two motivational books, Kiyosaki's included, and enough is enough!  I am looking for something with substance.  Fortunately, I did not purchase this book but checked it out from my local library.    Look elsewhere for your reading/educational materials, folks - you can do so much better then this one.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Well, like everybody else I \\"pulled the trigger\\" on a new batch of 2007 CDs from Amazon, then kept my fingers crossed as they shipped out and I got a chance to start listening to them.  Most of them were a letdown (isn't that always the case?), so I wasn't really expecting much from Neon Bible.<br /><br />This CD is one of the finest CDs of 2007 in my opinion.  It's darker than Funeral (which is saying something), but also more beautiful.  It's kind of a strange clash of genres, but what would you expect from Arcade Fire?<br /><br />The recording quality is great.  It sounds 80s synthpop to my ears for the most part (there's obviously been a resurgence of some 80s sounds, so nothing surprising there).  But, there are some obvious church hymnal themes thrown in there as well.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the best CDs I have heard in a while, and it (in my opinion) surpasses Funeral.  I'm glad at least some bands are improving with age, and I hope they can keep this trend up.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|I've always loved the DOORS, have their albums, their LIVE shows, sheet music, books, poems, DVDs, reunion films, offically licenced products, you name it. But, here comes a remix/remaster of one of their best works, with NEW bonus tracks, outtake photos, and the lyrics. So, more product the Door's fans are going to grab. On one of the outake photos from the photoshoot for the cover, JIM wrote in chalk behind him, \\"I think I know the reason but I cant spell it.\\" WOW. I'd put the money out just for these outtake photos, cos of the little bits of insight even they reveal. (A picture is worth a thousand words, but i'll limit it to 20-30.) However, let's look at the whole product objectively, if such a thing is possible, after fourty years of books, band reunions, the various films, and modern pop mythology clouding our reaction to changing the sound on songs, that for some of us, are sacrosanct in the canon of rock and roll history. The biggest change in the mix, is that the bass parts are VERY loud, and Jim's yips and yelps during the instrumental parts of the songs, are not edited out. I wonder if Jim would have wanted all that personal yelping in place, or if he might have wanted some of his handclaps, (The Spy), guide vocal bleed thru (Blue Sunday?), or pre-take chatter (Land Ho!) removed? On one take, I think it's Ship of Fools, you hear Paul Rothchild say \\"16\\" at the beginning of the song. (meaning take 16 obviously.) Its said over the instrumental vamp that starts the song, and hardly ads anything noteworthy to the song, other than a Cinema veritie vibe. I like to look for the outtakes, and alternate takes, for my Cinema Veritie view of work process. Also, on another song, for some strange reason, the organ and the guitar parts were interchanged between channels. Again, i cant for the life of me figure out WHY that would have been nessacary. I hope, i really do, that this remix wasnt just balanced, leveled, and then allowed to run, without editing out extraneous noise and studio sounds, unconsidered guitar lines, or vocalizations by Jim, which were mixed out when the offical mix was made for valid esthetic reasons. This remixed version, as good as the sound density becomes from the louder bass part, shouldn't replace permenantly the mix made for the album when it was first released. After all, the time, and consideration put into the mix at the time, is just as important, as any other part of the recording process. So, does Jim want his extra vocalizations in the mix? Obviously he is not around to give his imput on this, and personally, I'm tired of hearing Ray tell people what JIM wanted. Only Jim understood Jim, or should ever be expected to speak for him. Think I'm wrong? Dont forget how Jim reacted to the car commercial that the other Door members allowed LIGHT MY FIRE to grace back in the late 60s, and how betrayed Jim felt over that. Jim almost seems to be commenting on the situation, in one of the outtake photos. In it, Jim is in a closet posed over a TV set, that is playing HOLLYWOOD SQUARES. I'm sure that Jim had a lot of conflicts in his life, with \\"Hollywood Squares\\".<br /><br />As for the song alternate takes and outtakes, I can only say that, at least for this edition, they are fantastic. Everyone of them is worth listening to, and definately show the process involved in the band's creative process. As far as I know, no bootlegs have EVER surfaced of the DOORS unused studio outtakes. So this is definately a welcome addition. I do have one last criticism, and it's a big one. With the technology of DUALDISC, I cant understant why the Doors didnt allow the 5.1 DVD mix of these songs, which were included on their third, and latest box set from last year. It would have been nice, to have the 5.1 remix, along with some videos, included with the CD.  I have no idea how those 5.1 remixes sounded. Maybe they were not very good, except for those albums recorded on 8 or 16 tracks. I would have gladly paid a couple extradollars to have that DUALDISC technology involved with this project. Overall, for a true Door's fan, I suppose you are suppost to shell out $200 for the newest BOX SET to get those 5.1 DVD mixes, or live with the 2007 version. Well, fine for the famously rich. So, why did the band release these album remixes, with alternate takes? \\"I THINK I KNOW THE REASON BUT I CAN'T SPELL IT\\". ($$$-how do you THAT?)ars to have that DUALDISC technology involved with this project.

B000060O58|3.0|I guess that this is one of those recordings when the generational gap does matter. I am 32 years old and I grew up in the early 80's listening<br /><br />to period instruments performances of these works. I guess if had been much older today then my views of this recordings would have been different. My mother today thinks that this is one of the best recordings,<br /><br />ever of the music of Bach, and indeed it must of been back in the early 60's, but recent researches, and more \\"historically informed\\" performances put this recording way back near the end of the line. Just think when listening to this recording that it used to be the standard<br /><br />at a certain time in history, and that we can still draw a lot of<br /><br />good information on how music was performed in the past, before early<br /><br />instruments formed their own bands...
B000063UR2|5.0|This is by far my favorite fantasy movie.  Ridley Scott's world he created is simply phenomenal.  It's unlike anything else I have ever seen.  The best part being it is void of a lot of CGI, and the world is actually created, not computerized.  I almost wish I could live in that world.  It's pure fantasy at its finest.  Very hard to take your eyes off the screen.  You get sucked in very easily.  The story is great because of all the archetypes and how they fit together.  It almost feels like the supreme fantasy story.  Princess, unicorns, devil, true love, hero, light vs. dark.  Tremendous.  The more I watch it the more I like it.  It completely stands the test of time and will easily hold up years from now.  It should be a lesson to current movie makers that it's better to create a reality than simulate one.  Great acting by all those involved.  Also, enjoy all the great extras.  You can't get a better value for $14.  2 versions of the movie and a plethora of quality extras.  Not to mention a fabulous movie. <br /> <br />Thanks to all involved!
B00005JPLU|3.0|I guess it's true that everything old is eventually new again.<br /><br />In the early days of moviemaking - thanks primarily to budgetary constraints and the logistical difficulties brought about by having to work with primitive and cumbersome camera and sound equipment - directors rarely ventured outdoors to film even their most epic-type adventures.  Instead, they were forced to do most of their filming on a soundstage, shooting their actors in front of a painted backdrop or - when it became available - a more technologically advanced \\"blue screen,\\" which allowed them to add an array of previously impossible special effects to the picture as well.  Then, in the 1950`s and 1960`s, facing stiff competition from a burgeoning new medium known as television, filmmakers turned to \\"on-location\\" shooting as a means of both increasing the realism of their pictures and drawing people back to the theaters.  This was seen as a great leap forward for the movies both as an art form and as a business.<br /><br />Now, in 2007, it would appear that Hollywood has indeed come full circle with \\"300,\\" a rousing sword-and-sandal epic that has been filmed entirely in a studio, using only CGI effects to recreate the movie's ancient Mediterranean setting.  Ironically, this is being hailed as a great \\"innovation\\" by the very youngsters who would be yelling \\"That looks so fake\\" at all the similar themed movies from the 1930's and 1940's.  Go figure.<br /><br />If \\"300\\" has the look and feel of a comic book or video game, that is clearly no accident, for it comes from the highly acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley.  The story is based on the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. between the Persians, with a fighting force estimated at between 60,000 to 300,000 soldiers, and the Spartans, with a force of a mere 300 (plus around 700 Thespian volunteers).  The Spartans, trained from childhood to be professional fighters, ended up losing the battle but not before inflicting heavy losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.<br /><br />If it weren't for its unique look, there wouldn't be much to distinguish \\"300\\" from a hundred other action films.  The characters are wafer-thin and stereotypical, and the movie evinces a kind of xenophobia that is more than a trifle disconcerting in a world in which relations between the East and West are none too friendly to begin with.  All the Spartans, including their leader, King Leonidas, are light-skinned, noble warriors, while the Persians are dark-skinned, ignoble barbarians, whose general, King Xerxes, comes across as a lisping, mincing, make-up-wearing drag queen.  The dialogue and narration, provided by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and director Zack Snyder, is invariably cheesy, corny and insufferably self-important, while the actors, Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro and Lena Headey, pretty much fade into the obscurity of the computer-generated background.<br /><br />But trying to evaluate \\"300\\" apart from its visuals would be as meaningless as judging \\"Jurassic Park\\" without its dinosaurs.  For the look of the picture is what \\"300\\" is clearly all about, and on that level, the movie succeeds spectacularly.  The sepia-toned images of roiling land- and sky-scapes, massing armies and storm-tossed oceans are indeed something to behold and give the film an otherworldly quality that goes a long way towards mitigating the weaknesses in the acting and writing.  Even the ultra-violent, blood-soaked battle scenes, though a trifle redundant after awhile, take on a legendary quality thanks to the unreal aura of the scene.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is an interesting enough experience as a one-time thing, but I hope it doesn't signal a long term trend in moviemaking.  Personally, I rather like the great outdoors.losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.

0385732554|5.0|This book is filled with excitment and events that you would have never guessed. There are many twisting events and some confusing, upcomeing decsisions that have to be made.

No matter how many times you read this book your mind can never quite grasp the matters in this book. I highly suggest this book!
B00028U6B8|4.0|In the liner notes for this reissue Paul Kantner argues that the Airplane was not political. He suggests that the band \\"observed\\" rather than proselytized. Who are we to disagree? After all he did write or co-write We Can Be Together and Volunteers. However, whatever the band's intentions, it is inarguable that this record was, in 1969, de rigueur for those who considered themselves part of the counterculture. Kennedy had been murdered, Nixon was president and the war raged. To those who felt disenfranchised those two songs, together with Wooden Ships, certainly sounded political! This debate would, of course, be academic if the most important elements were absent. Fortunately, this record is loaded with stellar songs and superior musicianship.<br /><br />Jorma Kaukonen features prominently on Wooden Ships, Hey Frederick, Volunteers, Good Shepherd and Eskimo Blue Day. This under-rated guitarist has never played better than he does here. The ubiquitous, brilliant and influential Nicky Hopkins makes his presence felt. What a busy session man he was! Grace Slick and Marty Balin share the vocals for the very last time - regrettably, Balin and drummer Spencer Dryden left the group after this record. Without Balin the band continued for several years before morphing into the lamentable Jefferson Starship.<br /><br />The songs are uniformly strong, running the gamut from the hard-rocking Together and Volunteers to the balladic wizardry of Wooden Ships to the countrified The Farm. Hey Frederick is a fitting example of what had made the airplane so popular - uniquely Slick vocals, terrific guitar, more than a touch of psychedelia and slightly oblique lyrics. It is very San Francisco.<br /><br />What of the five \\"bonus\\" tracks? I am always torn when confronted with classic LPs that have been tampered with. If the additional songs are of a high quality and would have been included on the original if space permitted then there is no problem. I'm not so struck on the idea of alternative versions of songs already included and live versions of songs from prior albums. I know that I can program my player or simply eject after the originals have had their turn. This is not the point. My memory of these great old albums is the sound of the arm of the turntable lifting after the last notes of the last song have been played. I feel satisfied. The addition of \\"unworthy\\" additional tracks shouldn't detract from my enjoyment. It isn't logical.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|I think I'll make a film called \\"Mutiny on the Bounty.\\" No, it won't be about Fletcher Christian and it won't take place on a sailing vessel. It will be about a housewife who finds that \\"Bounty\\" isn't the quickest picker-upper and then rebels out front of the local supermarket with a lot of other wives. <br /> <br />That's what \\"Casino Royale\\" was to me. They took a famous title and hooked it to a famous film franchise; then they made it 21st Century film gritty and completely changed the character of Bond into Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible mirror image. <br /> <br />Indeed Daniel Craig is a fine new actor and acts with fierce intensity. But this isn't Bond. This is a new character which someone should have been brave enough to rename and start a new franchise. <br /> <br />At first I gave it 3 stars, but I then had to make it 2.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Up to about 1985 I bought Neil Young on vinyl. I have nearly every \\"official\\" LP - Springfield, CSN&Y, with Crazy Horse and, of course, solo. I just counted the Young cds that I have purchased since 1985.  There are sixteen of them. Surprisingly, although I am obviously a great admirer, I do not consider myself a huge \\"fan.\\"  Interspersed between his classics are quite a number of pretty awful records. So why buy another recording, particularly one with all familiar material?  Simple answer - it is fantastic.<br /><br />Although I have always preferred substance over sound I have to acknowledge how remarkable this thirty-six year old concert sounds. There is only Neil and his guitar or Neil at the piano. As I listen to this cd it is as if I am sitting in an acoustically perfect room with Mr. Young perched on a stool just a few feet in front of me. However, pristine clarity is worthless if the performance and the material are not up to scratch. On both scores this concert is a huge winner. I really don't think that Neil Young has ever sung so beautifully. His acoustic guitar playing is a revelation. Young is so famous for his incendiary and slightly sloppy (it is what makes him so endearing!) electric offerings that we forget how gifted a folk stylist he is. Rather than the usual inanities spouted by folkies between songs Neil's introductions are wry and interesting.<br /><br />Nearly all of the material is familiar to all but the most casual music fan. However, much had yet to be recorded. Accordingly, these new songs sound totally fresh. The famous electric rockers, Down by the River, Cowgirl and Ohio are surprisingly effective. How many artists can strip their hard-rocking concert showstoppers down to vocals and guitar and lose absolutely nothing in the process?<br /><br />This is not just a cd for Neil Young fans. It is for everyone who loves music.
B000OCZBS0|4.0|I remember the first time I heard the pairing of melodic female vocals with a heavy rock/metal song. It was unlike anything I'd heard before, and I loved it from the start.<br /><br />Since then, I've spent many years exploring this interesting musical genre, and have found a few great bands (Within Temptation, Oratory, Leaves Eyes) and a boatload of horrid bands (Edenbridge, the thunderously terrible Alas, and WAY too many others to name). But not since the first time I heard that first song have I ever sat up and taken notice of a truly different sound.<br /><br />Until I discovered Diablo Swing Orchestra.<br /><br />Where to begin? The opening track, \\"Balrog Boogie,\\" is like nothing I've ever heard before. Mixing elements of jazz, swing, metal, opera, and a sly sense of humor, this track defies categorization. Strangely enough, it reminds me of something you'd hear on one of the old \\"Muppet Show\\" episodes, all creative and entertaining.<br /><br />The thing is, each song on this album is unique in its own way. Some have the jazz sound, some have a mariachi flavor, others feel like something out of the old west. As far as instruments go, in addition to the usual guitar/bass/drum mix, there's cellos, horns, violins, flutes, and even a didgeridoo to be found in the various songs. And those are just the ones I could identify - I'm sure there's more.<br /><br />What ties most all of the songs together is good, quality musicianship, a metallic heaviness, and a female lead singer who sounds like she just stepped off the stage of the Met. When I say she sings in an \\"opera\\" style, I mean it - this isn't some sort of high vibralto that she only hits in dramatic parts. No, she sings like Carolin Fortenbacher did on that one-off rock reimagining of Mozart's \\"die K&ouml;nigin der Nacht\\" that came out a couple of years ago.<br /><br />I wonder if her folks are all upset about paying for her classical music training, and then she goes and uses it to front an oddball metal band.<br /><br />Perhaps that's what attracts me so much to this group - you really have to like metal AND opera in order to enjoy their sound. There's a few parts where a (somewhat underutilized) male voice chimes in, and even the lead vocalist calms it down once or twice, but other than that, you'd better be a fan of opera, or at least have an open mind.<br /><br />My favorite tracks include \\"Poetic Pitbull Revolutions,\\" \\"Rag Doll Physics,\\" and \\"Wedding March for a Bullet.\\"  Visit their MySpace page for samples.<br /><br />I just can't overemphasize how unique and unprecedented this album is.group - you really have to like metal AND opera in order to enjoy their sound.

0385340540|2.0|A political and social commentary in disguise.  The theme seems to be we are a corrupt country where outgoing Presidents grant last minute pardons to convicted felons for large sums of money in order to assure a secure lifestyle after they leave office(Clinton??), are easily manipulated and are not too bright (Ford, Carter, Bush), and that the CIA really runs the entire show. (That takes care of the first couple of chapters).<br /><br />After that we are given lessons in the Italian language(did Grisham just get back from a trip to Italy and is attempting to impress us with his fluency in the language), as well as a long, boring tour of the countryside. (This fills the middle of the book).<br /><br />The final chapters are so contrived and unbelieveable it's like a fairy tale.  In the real world, our hero would have been a dead man long before he was able elude his pursuers and \\"pull off\\" this caper. (Or perhaps our government agencies are really that inept......another political comment???)<br /><br />All in all, this was a poor attempt.  Pleeeeeeze, give me another Firm, or King of Torts......or anything but this.

B000244EMO|5.0|This movie is a classic.  A masterpiece.  Perfectly crafted, paced and insanely tense.  There's not a wasted moment in the film.  A sci-fi thriller of the highest caliber.  It will last.  It has and will age very well.  Movie critics of the future will put this on their lists of best movies of all time.  Movie makers of today trying to craft action movies should watch this film and learn.  Good work Arnold.
0441009425|2.0|Well, I finished the book.  It was very, very imaginative; the tone was dark, even noir, which sits well with me.  And it ends with some hope.  So why was it so disappointing? <br /> <br />First: the characters are unappealing.  The handful of people whose story unfolds in this book are, with one minor exception in the cast, dislikable.  Hmmm.  Utterly dislikable, rather.  This flaw is fatal.  Every story is about people, even science fiction, alas. <br /> <br />Second: too many deus-ex-machina exploits.  Gadgets in this story are like magic in a bad fantasy novel: unbounded, limitless in power, always available at each whim or need.  Come on.  Constraints make the human struggle more interesting.  Technology is abused as a convenient excuse to make the impossible happen too many times.  Alas, even once is too many.  Sorry, my suspension of disbelief has limits. <br /> <br />Third: structure.  My goodness!  Complexity for complexity sake does not make for engaging storytelling.  The chapters are put together haphazardly, without structure or a systematic approach.  Even if unusual, I can get used to a method in the madness.  But no, here we have change in time, place, plotline, point of view, all without rhyme or reason.  Literary?  Bleah.   <br /> <br />Yet the book is so incredibly imaginative.  Science is appealing, but technology is abused, and the story is Byzantine in its narrative complexity.  There is enough suspence to (barely) overcome the tedium, and one character I liked enough to allow her to drag me to the end.  The closing is mildly satisfying.  This is a great idea gone sour, prey to vanity engaging in a solipsistic intellectual exercise: the author is the only one smart enough to conceive such complexity, let the readers catch up as they can.  Get off your horse.  Real genius turns difficult into understandable.  This books makes a great idea just very messy.  Maybe there is an exculpatory purpose in this eulogy of arrogance . . .. <br /> <br />I wondered about two or three stars, and settled for two to exact my revenge :)  Perhaps you'll like this book better than I did, but I doubt it, if you read for entertainment and are honest about your impressions.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|\\"Hey!\\" - the word of choice on this semi-concept album for Avril. Too many 'reviewers' here on Amazon are poo-pooing \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" without, perhaps, seeing the big picture. Avril is doing what a musical artist does and is their prerogative...reflect the times. She looks amazing and is her own person. People who are citing Britney as the epitome of current pop beauty are obviously outdated themselves since Brit's last real pop moment was years ago. I think that Avril let go just a tad bit of the slightly more acoustic/folky aspect of some of her tunes which were definitely prominent on her first album, \\"Let Go.\\" The song \\"Sk8er Boi\\" stood out as a faster driving number on that first album, and I personally wished there were a ton more songs on that album with such speedy energy. Then came \\"Under My Skin\\" and she did speed it up again with \\"He Wasn't\\" but I still wanted more songs like those two.  <br /> <br />Now comes \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" and it is nothing if but chock full of speedy tunes. Finally! Yay for me and those who like \\"Sk8r Boi.\\" Avril herself says right on her liner notes (for those who actually buy CD's or at least download the complete album with the booklet from iTunes) \\"I hope you play this in your car, sing it in the shower, dance to it with your friends, and rock out to it at my concert.\\" Well put. No problem, will do, Avril. She obviously had fun making this album and perhaps that's the view with which one should listen to it. Have a summer of fun. I plan on blasting this in my mom's convertible every chance I get.  <br /> <br />So, if you liked Avril's earlier punky fast songs more than the slower ones, this is an album gift wrapped for you from her. Yeah the theme is a lot of \\"Hey! Hey!\\" and boy stuff, but that's what makes you want to chant and sing along at the top of your lungs and jump around like you were electrified. If you preferred her slower, more 'moody' songs, you can always revert to \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Under My Skin.\\" However, ifyou need a soundtrack to the summer of fun - get this today. <br /> <br />Oh, and the first time you hear her say \\"I wear the pants!!\\" you will laugh and go...wow.
B0009ML238|5.0|I really like this CD. All of the songs are accessible, technical yet without being overly pretentious and shredding for shredding's sake (like some of the later DT, mainly Octavarium and TOT).  <br />There are hints of DT, Symphony X, and Ayreon, but it is not derivative but surprisingly fresh.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I had seen Daniel Craig in [[ASIN:B0009X7BDC Layer Cake (Widescreen Special Edition)]], and was very impressed with him as an actor. The curiosity factor was high when I wandered off to see \\"Casino Royale\\".<br /><br />Was Craig as good as some of the other Bond actors? No, simply put. However, this was his first Bond movie, and I think an actor of his skill will quickly gain a feel for his own interpretation of the character. Craig brings a certain ruthlessness to the role, and a gritty earthiness. Without the vast array of nifty gadgets, Bond is finally relying on his wits. Breaking into M's home was a nice touch.<br /><br />Balanced with that is Bond's sensitive side. I do not ever recall Bond falling in love before. The vulnerability made for a deeper character, perhaps the deepest since [[ASIN:B00004RG65 On Her Majesty's Secret Service]] with George Lazenby as Bond.<br /><br />The tension between M and Bond is plainly palpable, continuing one aspect from the previous movies with Brosnan. Another aspect of Bond that continues to develop is his sensivity and vulnerability. It is not emphasised, but it does poke through on the odd occassion.<br /><br />Bond spent a lot of time playing poker in this movie, and that was a bit of a drawback. However, the tension was maintained and well done. For anyone not familiar with poker, some of the game play may be a bit of a mystery. This section of the movie was nicely broken up with an awesome fight scene and some other elements of tension.<br /><br />Of particular note was the chase on foot between Bond and a bomb-maker in Madagascar. The agility and speed of the actor playing the bomb-maker was stupendous. The man could move like nothing I have ever seen. It was scenes and chases like this that made the movie truly great.<br /><br />Daniel Craig could be set to become a Bond actor of the highest calibre. If \\"Casino Royale\\" is anything to go on, I think we can expect some great things in the future.
067003830X|5.0|I have taken an interest in mind/brain science over the past several months. Having started my nursing career on a medical neurology ward, I \\"grew up\\" with the localizationist interpretation of brain function and of the irreversible nature of brain damage. One couldn't help, however, having seen evidence in the course of ones practice that overwhelmingly contradicted the accepted view, so I was very pleased to see that so much has been done lately in researching the plasticity of the brain and its ability to \\"fix\\" or at least bypass damage to its structure.<br /><br />The author, a psychologist with a practice in Canada, approaches his narrative almost as a journalist. He has researched the field and interviewed many of those who have been responsible for breakthroughs in mind/brain science. He gives a brief personal biography and characterization of the scientist as an individual, and then goes on to report the results of their research and the contributions that the work has provided individual patients. Here too the persons' lives and experiences are provided so that each becomes real to the reader. In this way the actual advances are given very personal meaning and significance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the book should be a must read for neurology residents--if it or something like it has not already been added to the core curriculum. The research and the individual representative cases provided are an amazing illustration of what has and may be done in the near future of neurological diseases and disorders. Certainly anyone with a neurological disorder will find the information inspiring and hopeful. No longer is he or she expected to learn to \\"accept\\" their disability or to \\"learn to live with it.\\" More active approaches to treatment seem to work far better than had been believed by earlier generations of neuroscientists and physiotherapists. Most important is the issue of providing treatment for disabilities, of extending and intensifying therapies not just to a fixed time decided upon arbitrarily but to a point when actual change and improvement are seen to occur. Some of the illustrative cases are certainly exceptional, maybe even just \\"lucky\\" individuals, but many of them derived considerable benefit from the approaches used to treat their disability by researchers.<br /><br />Among the most amazing stories are those of stroke victims who have recovered almost entirely from their neurological damage and returned to an active life. Others are about new technologies for providing sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and greater autonomy to the movement impaired. Some of the findings about the aging brain are especially interesting and hopeful. In fact I was so impressed with some of it, that I gave the book to a friend who also worked in neurology in \\"the old days\\" and who is now dealing with the issues of living with her mother whose memory is gradually failing and whose everyday life is getting to be more and more difficult and complicated.<br /><br />A superb book.just to a fixed time decided upon arbitrarily but to a point when actual change and improvement are seen to occur.

B000AP04FG|4.0|When first exposed to \\"Mr & Mrs Smith\\", I had my doubts. First, romantic comedy is something I really don't like admitting to enjoying, (no matter how many guns they have). This movie was a pleasant surprise, and I had a real hoot watching it, (and many times since).<br /><br />The humour is verbal with some very good lines, but this is also made punchier by the plethora of situational gags exploiting the contexts they are used it. Sounds dull and dry the way I say it, but what it amounts to is a complex comedy that works. The tentative questions about \\"how many\\" are given a whole new twist with the Smiths.<br /><br />Pitt and Jolie have an on screen chemistry that works in most scenes. There are a couple of fizzled points, but for the most part, they really spark well and add to the laughs. Jolie's line \\"Are you still alive, Baby?\\" is a classic. Pitt once again demonstrates his ability for comedy, and Jolie also has a knack for it.<br /><br />Having two enemy assassins married to each other was an inspired innovation, and it really goes off with people like Pitt and Jolie in the lead roles. Vince Vaughn still plays much the same character as in other movies such as [[ASIN:B000BKVQRU Wedding Crashers (R-Rated Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0006419IM Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story (Widescreen Edition)]]. That sort of \\"I'm ok, you're ok\\" guy that Vaughn seems to do well with, recently.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie. I think I may have to admit that romantic comedy may be something I like. Bummer.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!!! The first time I listened to the whole album I was a little worried that she was going back to her teenage era,but as I continued listening I found myself loving every song on this CD.Yes,it's different from \\"Under My Skin\\".It's more carefree and playful,and you can just tell that she is in a much happier place in her life.Some of the more mellow tracks like When You're Gone,Innocence,and Contagious are beautifully written and sung and show how happy she is.I def. think that everyone should give this CD a chance.It's fun,in your face,and The Best Damn Thing I've heard lately ;)
B000O178BY|3.0|While I admire the lyrical themes of the new NIN disc, the tunes themselves are so lacking in melodic value that the CD stands out for me as the first mediocre album ever by Mr. Reznor.  The songs set up a chilling vision of a future America where many of the bad totalitarian tendencies we see in society today have been taken to an extreme.  As many other customers have mentioned, it's a very appropriate discussion to be having in the country right now.  The music is interesting as well in terms of the SOUND of this disc, with Reznor's many creative electronic flourishes and spacey-spooky sound FX.  The big problems is that the tunes, or melodies, are mostly so forgettable... there's almost NOTHING on year zero that holds a candle to powerful NIN songs of the past.  Mark my words --- people will NOT be singing along with most of these tunes word-for-word in concert the way they do to songs from Downward Spiral, the Fragile, etc.  On top of all of that, several of the songs are marred by a new thing he is doing on the choruses, with a warped mini-choir singing the words in unison.  It's a very annoying trick that brings down the tunes with a kind of musical theater feeling.  Maybe one of the song titles, \\"the Beginning of the End,\\" is sadly prophetic, and this CD is the start of Reznor's descent to the level of an artist who will no longer matter musically.  (I know this review is sure to anger many NIN loyalists - something I once considered myself to be.  You can click \\"no\\" for the \\"helpful\\" question now.)<br /><br />One other item -- Trent wanted to be provocative by placing a fake government warning label from the \\"Bureau of Morality\\" on the back cover.  It ends up being an unintentional poke in the eye because nearby is a REAL government warning from the FBI regarding Unauthorized copying.  This CD is a corporate product in a society and an industry that can prosecute people who illegally share or copy music.  Does Reznor's fake government message seem hypocritical to anyone besides me?critical to anyone besides me?
B000N4SHPS|3.0|This movie was not all I thought it would be. Honestly I am torn on my opinion. There were things about it I liked and things about it I disliked. Here is the lowdown on what I thought and why...    What I liked: Stallone is in AWESOME shape and is an inspiration to people young and old. A healthy lifestyle pays off and here is your proof. He still has a great body. He still looks great shirtless even at 60 years old and I respect that a lot. It's not easy to stay in that kind of shape at any age. The acting, Stallone has matured as an actor and is a lot more natural and believable than in other movies. The cinematography was nice and really captured the essence of the first Rocky movie. The HBO PPV fight LOOKED like a real boxing match! The camera angles during the fight looked very authentic. Paulie was great, I loved his line about \\"People who skate on ice are stupid\\" (I am not a fan of the cold either) and I think he was a valuable and funny character in this movie. Paulie added some laughs in the somber beginning. The Champ, they picked a real boxer for the part of the rival and I think the authenticity really came through, he's not a bad actor and I hope to see him in other roles in the future. It's nice to see someone who is not just an athlete but has other talents too! He did a very good job of acting like the young, self-absorbed, arrogant champion. To see him interviewed in real life, he seems like a respectful, humble guy. I think this role was a good challange for him. He actually seemed to enjoy playing an ego-inflated star who everyone hates and I think it takes a lot of character for an otherwise nice guy to play such a role.       What I disliked: The slow, sappy version of the famous \\"Rocky\\" music. I thought the music was a downer and really did not like hearing the formerly upbeat and inspirational theme song slowed down to the pace of a funeral dirge through most of the film! Yeah we get it, we are supposed to feel sad, depressed and it's meant to be nostalgic. It was overkill! The first half hour of the film is dedicated to showing how down in the dumps Rocky is, his wife is dead and he goes to all his old hangouts and there are too many flashbacks. The beginning dragged a lot and I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. The son, a good actor who looked a lot like Stallone but the whole 'living in dad's big shadow' concept was cliche. I didn't like his character at all. I found it hard to believe that a 25-30 year old man would still have such an immature resentment of his dad. I was thinking \\"Dude, get over it, grow up and give your old man a break!\\" This attitude would have been more suited to the behavior of a teenager and not a grown man, though I did like Rocky's speech to his son about blaming people and making excuses. Way to go dad, I would have felt the same way if I had such a grumpy, ungrateful kid! I also thought it was unrealistic how the son suddenly was so supportive after being so distant for so long. It was painful to watch such a loving kind hearted dad being brushed off by his whiny, wimpy and disrespectful son! The girl Marie, they could have heated this part up just a little, it was too 'innocent' a relationship. Rocky's wife is dead, he's had a tough time, the guy deserves to hook up with a new lady and prove that he is indeed still the Italian Stallion! I would not have gone so far as a love scene but I found the one kissing scene was too 'vanilla' for my taste. I wasn't feeling any passion there. So, Rocky is not young anymore but he's not dead, geeze! The ending, ok so it was realistic but it was dissapointing, I much preffered the alternate ending on the DVD! I also could have done without the shot of Adrienne's grave, like we already SAW that 3 times during the film, why show it again and end a good movie on a sad note? We know she is gone, I want to see him move on with his life and stop wallowing in the past like he did for half the movie.     Overall, I liked the movie but I didn't love it. Halfway through the film I was thinking \\"PLEASE lets get past the sappy parts and show him training, climbing stairs, drinking raw eggs and punching sides of beef!\\" I really liked how the other Rocky movies pumped me up and made me want to go work out. This movie did not have the degree of adrenaline that I would have wanted in an action-based Stallone movie.      This movie showed a more human Rocky but it was so overdone it came off too sappy and slowed the pace of the film. There was a lot of emotion in the beginning but the end lacked emotion and fell flat. There was a big build up and it lacked a big ending to carry it. I wanted to see the tear-jerking ending where he triumphs over all odds after being beaten to a bloody pulp. The satisfaction simply wasn't there. It was a good ending to a great series but unfortunately I think this movie could have been better.     The alternate ending on the DVD was stellar and would have been a much better choice than the original. If they had gone with the alternate ending I'd have given it 4 stars. If they had done that and cut down on the sap and sad music I'd have given it 5 stars. It was WAY better than Rocky 5 but that's not saying much because Rocky 5 was a one star movie as far as I was concerned. I am looking forward to the next Rambo movie and I hope it has a better ending than Rocky Balboa. I might watch this again one day but I think I will skip the ending and watch the alternate one instead!
B000NA1OXY|4.0|Avril's The Best Damn Thing is not as trailblazing as her debut, Let Go, which spawned a number of pop/rock artists. But it really is pure Avril, and it can be thrilling to hear her let loose. I'll go through the songs: \\"Girlfriend\\" is catchy, but a little childish. Also, it wasn't really needed when there's a superior chanting song - the title track. \\"Runaway\\" pleasantly reminds me of her Let Go days. \\"I Can Do Better\\" propels marvelously. \\"Innocence\\" and \\"When You're Gone\\" show maturity in her songwriting. \\"Innocence\\" in particular impressed me with how touching she can be. \\"Everybody Back But You\\" reminds me of early Blink 182, which is a compliment. The crunchy \\"Hot\\" is another highlight. I could do without the snooty \\"I Don't Have To Try,\\" and while \\"Keep Holding On\\" sounds better at the end of an album, it still seems a bit like a filler choice for last song. \\"Contagious\\" has a nifty soft rock riff. While I wouldn't give this CD As like Let Go and Under My Skin, it still gets a very good B+! <br />
B0002VB24K|5.0|Its my little secret. I dare not tell any of my friends. Shhh! <br />This movie is my favorite of the Happy potters. Snape seems nicer, and there is a twist! Ron's rat turns out to be something its not. And someone is a warewolf! Guess who! <br />This movie is the greatest, I'm going to buy all of them!
1932907009|1.0|If one takes the time to IMDB the authors name, one will find two movies listed - Blank Check and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot - amusingly enough... the latter won an award for -worst- screenplay. If you don't believe me, look it up yourself. <br /> <br />The internet has given us such a glistening monolithic world of exploration to traverse - one only needs to type in the appropriate words.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Well, this movie had a profound impact on me. I discovered Bruce Lee shortly after his death, and then he became my childhood hero. Yes, I had all the posters and all the books. I even studied Wing Chun as an adolescent, just like he did. Speaking of which, it is amazing to me that until his last breath he never really abandoned that style of fighting, despite all his experimentation and despite founding Jeet Kune Do. Leaving aside the opening scene in which he mostly adopts Mui Thai (Kickboxing), and with remarkable prescience, Ultimate Fighting type mixed martial arts, the rest of the film in terms of his hand fighting is strictly Wing Chun: all the trapping hands and short, precise, practical movements and techniques are virtually 100% Wing Chun.    Now, was this Bruce Lee's best film? Well, in some ways in terms of production values it was. But if you pay close attention to Fists of Fury (also known as The Chinese Connection), and Return of the Dragon, you'll find that the production values of those two weren't that far behind ETD, and in some cases were better. Production wise, nothing in ETD can compare with the battle with Chuck Norris in the Coliseum in the climactic scene from Return of the Dragon. Similarly, in Fists of Fury, the battle in the Japanese Karate dojo along with the fight against the big European towards the end are as good, if not better than anything in Enter the Dragon. The one poorly produced film made by Bruce Lee would be The Big Boss, his first on his return to Hong Kong. Although, that too had some scintillating and spectacular fight scenes.    In terms of Bruce Lee himself, I'm afraid to say he was past his prime at this juncture. Remarkable, powerful and masterful yes, but somewhat past the prime he demonstrated in his earlier films. Martial Arts, in the end, is an athletic endeavor, and athletes generally reach their prime in their mid to late 20s and pass it as they approach 30 and beyond. And, of course, Bruce Lee was under an extreme amount of pressure. This would be his make or break film. If it failed he would be finished in Hollywood, if it succeeded he would finally take his place among the Hollywood elite whom he alternately admired, envied and detested. In addition to that, there were guys coming out of the woodwork wanting to fight him and claim the singular distinction of being the one guy who kicked Bruce Lee's butt. When he couldn't avoid it, he actually had a couple of real fights on set during the making of this film, and he didn't dissapoint. There was no fancy stuff, his opponents were quickly and ruthlessly dispatched. Had he lost any of those fights his career would be over.      All in all this film is a classic. It has some of the most brutal and beautiful hand to hand fight sequences ever committed to film. The battles are at once fantastical and savagely realistic. There is a minimum of fakery here, which at the time was the hallmark of Kung fu movies. And while Bruce Lee would always add fancy kicking to his film repertoire, many of his techniques here are in fact practical and commonsensical, and would work on the street if executed by a decent fighter.    Enter the Dragon is the only Bruce Lee film in which we hear his real voice. And it was finally the big budget, relatively carefully made Kung-fu movie everyone was clamoring for. But the greatest compliment I can pay this film is that after having watched it dozens of times over the last 30+ years, I can still watch it over and over again.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Dont listen to the people who think this film is depressing.  This film is about nothing but optimism, not giving up, Integrity and triumph of human soul. You only need to watch the interview with real Chris gardner (included on DVD) to see the incredible human he is and his wisdom. a very uplifting and inspiring story.
B000002KBU|3.0|Mellow, introspective, and sparsely orchestrated, Blue features a few B-list tunes (Carey, This Flight Tonight, River) but the rest of the material doesn't disappoint. Joni's voice is pure and angelic throughout, although when she soars into the high notes it sometimes seems forced. Alanis Morissette wouldn't have bothered with her career if she'd given Blue a good listen - Joni was trumping her 25 years earlier.
0553383663|2.0|Here's a quick summary of the book--Everything that google does is wonderful and google has changed the world as we know it. Come on. How about a little more impartiality. How about going more into privacy and IP issues? I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would not recommend buying it.
B000E5KJES|5.0|having not seen this movie i decided to purchase it after i had been told what a good movie it is. on that note, being an hd dvd, and not seeing the dvd version, i can tell you that as old as this movie is, being on hd dvd, looks like a movie that just came out, you cant even tell its an older movie. all in all this is a very good movie, and i love my hd dvd player more and more with every hd dvd purchased. HD DVD is definetly better than blu-ray...if you remember antthing from this review, remember that...
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Gilmour has laid low for a long time.  His last solo album was 22 years ago, and his last work with Pink Floyd more than a decade.  So it was with great anticipation when it was announced the Gilmour was finally going to release some new music in 2006.  The resulting album \\"On An Island\\" finds a mature artist looking back on a full life seemingly content in his early senior citizen years.  The material was all written by Gilmour with lyrical help from his wife Polly Samson on several tracks.  Gust musicians include Richard Wright (Pink Floyd), David Crosby and Graham Nash (CSN), Guy Pratt (Pink Floyds' touring band), Jools Holland (Squeeze), Phil Manzanera (Roxy Music), Robert Wyatt (Happy The Man), and others.  The album is primarily a moody affair with slower melodic songs that don't necessarily bang you over the head upon first listen, but slowly work their way into the listeners brain over repeated listens.   This is a very different album from Gilmour's previous two solo discs.  Personally I don't think it is quite as good, but I do enjoy it for what it is.  As mentioned earlier the album is very mellow and moody.  The closest thing to a rocker on the album is the track \\"Take A Breath\\" which is actually one of the weaker songs.  The album is a mix of vocal tunes and instrumentals.  Some of it sounds to me like early Pink Floyd and would have fit right in on \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" or \\"Meddle\\".  Highlights include the title track \\"On An Island\\", \\"The Blue\\", \\"Red Sky At Night\\", \\"A Pocketful Of Stones\\", and the closer \\"Where We Start\\".  I have to be in the right mood for this album, but I would rate it a solid 4 star from Mr. Gilmour.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|Fun soundtrack. But the highlight is definitely BABY IT'S YOU by Smith. This great song still rocks thanks to vocalist Gayle McCormick. Don't go through life without listening to it a few 100 times.
B000ELJBAA|5.0|By 1984 Pink Floyd had effectively broken up.  Gilmour decided to strike out on his own and unlike his previous solo effort, this time he put a proper band together and went on a lengthy world tour.  The album was to be the start of his solo career outside of Pink Floyd, but sales did not reach the numbers that many had hoped and like Roger Waters, Gilmour found that as a concert draw he was not in the same league as the Pink Floyd franchise.  All that being said the album was quite good and played to Gilmour's strengths.  His band consisted of Jeff Porcaro on drums (Toto), Pino Palladino on bass (The Who), and Ian Kewley on keys.  The album also contained an all star lineup of special guests including Steve Winwood (Traffic), Bob Ezrin (Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd), Ray Cooper (Eric Clapton), Jon Lord (Deep Purple), and Roy Harper.  Gilmour wrote all of the music and lyrics with the exception of \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" which was co-written with Pete Townshend.  I like this album a lot.  No it is not Pink Floyd, but there really is not a bad song on the disc.  Much of the album has an 80's feel to it, and I hear a lot of similarities to some of the music in \\"The Wall\\".  The single \\"Blue Light\\" was a bit funky for some people, although I personally liked it.  The best track on the album \\"Murder\\" got some AOR airplay at the time and is classic Gilmour.  \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" features a full orchestra conducted by Michael Camen and is big, loud and bombastic.  \\"You Know I'm Right\\" was written for Gilmour's estranged partner from Pink Floyd, Roger Waters.  \\"Until We Sleep\\", \\"Love On The Air\\", \\"Out Of The Blue\\", \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\", \\"Cruise\\" and \\"Near The End\\" are all great tunes.  I like all of Gilmour's solo works, but I think this one may be his best.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I had high expectations, for this film, and it did not disappoint me. A very warm hearted story and one that will stay with you. I highly recommend this film for anyone who can appreciate a story about human emotions and devotion.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I purchased The Best Damn Thing explicit/DVD deluxe, and all I have to say is that she has come a long way since Under My Skin three years ago! This album combines the perfect blend of classic punk-rock Avril with enough ballads to keep those satisfied who prefer the slower, emotional side of Lavigne! The best part of this particular edition is that the DVD (almost an hour long) shows all kinds of scenes with Avril recording and writing for this CD. Listen to it again after watching this, and you will get a better understanding of what her songs mean to her! So buy The Best Damn Thing right now, and discover the new, Limoncello drinking Avril Lavigne!!!
B00030IZY0|4.0|Cyndi Lauper Live in Paris --- I have a tatty old VHS tape that I made from the original 1987 HBO concert. It has moved with me, and I have treasured it. I have been looking for this concert on DVD for years. So, here it turns up on Amazon, from a Marketplace vendor, from BRAZIL of all places, with the graphics in Portugese. Another reviewer is right, the video quality isn't great. It looks like it wasn't made from a master tape --- BUT, I was prepared for that. Just the ability to have this wonderful concert in a non-deteriorating DVD is important to me. These live versions are all my favorites, especially \\"All Through the Night\\" and \\"Time After Time.\\" The HBO version was shorter, about an hour. If you are looking for a really sharp picture, you won't find that here. But the sound is fine. And it is probably better than my old VHS tape, by now. All of my TVs are digital now, so my VHS player doesn't even work with them. Overall, very pleased to have found this on DVD!!!!
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|\\"The only drawback is that \\"Donuts\\" on a whole carries the stamp of something manufactured or, like the scarecrow in Oz, lacking a heart\\" <br /> <br />As I was reading that I was wondering if you even listened to the cd?  Donuts is anything but manufactured, amazing beats like this CAN'T be manufactured.  This cd is a classic, 31 tracks of the dopest beats you will ever hear from the most under appreciated producer/rapper of all time.  Don't waste your time reading reviews on this cd, just buy it!   <br /> <br />R.I.P Dilla Dog <br />
B000GFLAI0|2.0|Very nice of Amazon to make this album available for free on its web site, but once I set it up with Windows Media I immediately became very disappointed.  The songs fade in so quickly and seemingly right in the middle of a line, then, after thirty seconds or so, fade out just as quickly--often just as Dylan is about to resolve a thought or give a punchline.   <br /> <br />The problem starts with the opening number, the promising \\"Thunder on the Mountain,\\" whose cryptic lyrics, \\"You brought me here and now you're running me away/The writing on the wall...\\" left me confused and unsatisfied.  Same goes for \\"Rollin' and Tumblin',\\" a rollicking number that, just when you get into the rhythm, fades out and leaves you hanging.  By the end I was left feeling so completely baffled and unsatisfied that I vowed never to listen to the album again.  Maybe this is some kind of new approach to musicmaking that I'm just too old to appreciate, but I prefer songs that start with an intro and end with some kind of resolution.  Dylan is a living legend and should give himself more than thirty seconds to develop a theme.
1559409002|5.0|This is an amazing film. If you like horror movies, this is a must see. This film has more creepyness than new films costing 100 times as much to make. Excellent story and eerie mood will keep the bed covers pulled up to your eyes. Watch this in the dark alone!......Spooky! Awesome DVD transfer by Criterion with a load of extra goodies!
B00001QGPS|5.0|Someone wrote that the \\"beats on 'Blackout' are sub par, thanks in part to the Wu Tang crew\\" and a few other collaborators.  This is one of the best hip hop albums to date.  Lyrical quality and quality of beats don't get much better than \\"Blackout,\\" Red and Meth compliment each other perfectly on the album and there is not a track that I feel like I have to skip over. Finding an album where every song is a quality track is becoming more and more elusive in the current hip hop market.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought OK Computer when it came out, and ten years later I still listen to it consistently.  Radiohead is my favorite band so I am biased, but imo this is currently the best Radiohead album and arguably the best album of the 1990s.  OK Computer is a good place for someone interested in Radiohead to start.
B00006I03J|5.0|Spider-Man is the kind of movie that I can watch again and again that has never aged. It has only been a few years since it came out in theaters, but it is still as fun and spectacular as it was when I first watched it way back then. I have been a Spidey fan since the 80s, so he has always been a hero of mine, you can imagine the thrill I had when I finally got to see him on the big screen. Sam Raimi did an excellent job on this movie and it shows from beginning to end.<br /><br />Tobey McGuire is definitely the perfect choice to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He definitely brings the nerdiness out of Peter, but also brings the strength and courage of Spider-Man. You feel for the guy when a certain family member dies, and you cheer when he finally gets his revenge on those who hurt him and his family. With that said, I think the real movie star is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He is an incredible actor and is always fun to see on screen. From his change in voice to his facial expressions when he is the Goblin, no wonder he has been kept for the sequels, he is just someone fun to watch.<br /><br />Overall, this is a movie that you have to see if you haven't already, whether you are a fan or not. The story and script is both compelling and fun and the special effects are amazing. What can be said that hasn't already? This movie is awesome and it is something that you just have to see to believe. Incredible
0812550706|4.0|My name is Rachel and I am 16 years old.  I am a junior in high school and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card was a reading requirement for my English class.  I also love reading outside of school; I do it as much as I can when I have free time.  I have read quite a few science-fiction books as well as many other novels from various genres.  Although we were required to read Ender's Game, I enjoyed it thoroughly and found myself reading way ahead of the class and unable to put it down. <br /> Although I liked Ender's Game overall as a novel, there were a few components I did not particularly care for.  The plot was somewhat split in two, one half concentrating on Ender's story in space, and the other concentrating on the simultaneous happenings on earth and the story of Valentine and Peter Wiggin.   The issues on Earth, in my opinion, were not explained clearly enough. It was difficult for me to grasp which parts of the world were plotting to attack which others.  Valentine and Peter talk about these issues as if they are \\"old news\\" but I seemed to be lost during these conversations. What I did like about the novel was being able to know what was going through Ender's mind at all times.  Reading about Ender's struggles from home, to those from battle school, to command school and beyond and how he overcame every obstacle put in his way was enjoyable for me.  I also found myself very interested in how Ender was given no opportunity to become close with all other students, but he managed to make a few extremely close friends who learned to love Ender despite his uniqueness. <br />Card's writing style, in general, was actually one of the main things that made me like this book. At the start of each chapter, Card uses dialogue among the various adult characters, such as Graff and Anderson, to foreshadow the events that immediately follow.  He also writes in a way that allows the reader to know Ender's thoughts and feelings; most of the novel is written from Ender's pointof view.  Card creates a few round characters that we are able to learn a lot about. But he also includes multiple flat characters that we know so little about, but are still critical to the plot. <br />I definitely recommend this book to any fan of science fiction, but I also recommend it to any dedicated reader also, even if sci-fi is not a particular interest.  Young children should probably not read this book because of the complexity of the plot.  It might be hard for them to fully comprehend the different themes and certain specific plot points of the novel at such a young age.  I suggest this to readers that are 14 years of age or older. <br />
B000002INR|4.0|One of the most brilliantly numbskull heavy rock records ever to emerge from the 80's this debut album from Skid Row is a powerful mix of throwaway cliched sentiments and biting  blasts of bile. This is a late 80's hair metal band but one you should buy into - as opposed to corporate dross like Tangier or Danger Danger. The reason? Actual fire in the belly. Actual grunt under the bonnet - a serious big block of pounding and reckless self belief.<br /><br />Going into specifics is beside the point. This is an album that should  be taken in it's entirety and as such it represents a hell of a party. Motormouth frontman Bach is in fine fettle, his infectious personality and blazing set of pipes cutting a swathe through the solid rawk rock provided by the guys.<br /><br />Some critics did point out that much of this product was fairly, well, full of hot air. And that's tru to a certain extent. But compare this to stuff like Ratt, another dependable act of the time, or Warrant even? In relation to Ratt, this disc has huge 'X' factor that commands attention with it's great hooks and personality. Regarding the latter named hair band, well the full bodied attack and the full on assault and the psychologically haunting aspects of this album like the lyrics to 18 and Life means that posers like Warrant are blown away. This album scored five stars in Metal hammer upon it's release by then editor Chris Welch, who was nobodies fool.<br /><br />My honest advice is that while this is not a flawless record it is a fine, fine hard rock record with weight and delicious sneer. So pick it up - heck it's cheap enough so why not take the plunge!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|When I first heard Jet, I couldn't believe they were a new band.  Maybe I'm a little biased, but I thought there was no way a new band could sound so new and exciting.  But they do! <br /> <br />There are many great tracks here.  \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and \\"Look What You've Done\\" are incredible rockers.  The rest are great as well.  It's true that Jet didn't stray too far from their influences, but that's okay in my book.  I love the classics (The Who The Beatles, The Stones, etc), and I don't mind hearing new music in the same style.  After all, I'd choose a Jet concert over a modern day Who concert any day. <br /> <br />I say give Jet time to evolve.  After all, it took The Beatles a good number of years to get past \\"She loves you yeah yeah yeah\\" and when they did get past it, they did Sgt. Pepper.  I think Jet definately has potential, and I wouldn't be so quick to write them off.
B000O178BY|5.0|(\\"Year Zero\\" by Nine Inch Nails)<br /><br />I'm sure that by now you've been reading about the elaborate \\"viral marketing\\" scheme Trent Reznor has concocted for his new concept album, \\"Year Zero.\\"  Numerous mysterious web sites with names like IAmTryingToBelieve and AnotherVersionOfTheTruth help tell the hyperlinked story of a future America (2022, now reset to just 0000) in which a Christian theocracy has seized power, setup a Draconian Department of Morality, keeping the nation in a perpetual state of war and fear, and is dumping mind control drugs into the water, etc. etc. ad nauseum.  This is all very appealing if, say, you're still crushed by \\"The X-Files\\" no longer being in production or obsessively haunt \\"Lost\\" related sites searching for clues.  However, if you're just a plain old music fan, you'll tend to ignore the crypto-hype and just ask if this is an actual album worth losing part of your hearing to.  Well, friends and neighbors, I'm happy to report that not only is this a great album, but it's also NIN's best music since [[ASIN:B000001Y5Z The Downward Spiral]] way back in 1994.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I liked [[ASIN:B00001P4TH The Fragile]] and [[ASIN:B000929AJQ With Teeth]], but \\"Year Zero\\" returns Reznor's work to the more experimental edginesss that gave \\"Spiral\\" such a spark of brilliance.  Ignoring current trends in music, YZ often goes full throttle into left-field electronica.  After an opening salvo of noisy rock (and BTW, most of the album is pretty noisy) with a heavy but raw drum sound, songs like \\"Vessel\\" and \\"Me, I'm Not\\" are a successful mashup of punk and Autechre-style glitch, while \\"Capital G\\" seems to be Reznor's angry version of the U.K. grime scene.  \\"Survivalism,\\" the first single, is in many ways classic NIN: gritty electro/metal/punk along the lines of older songs like \\"Mr. Self Destruct,\\" only with a more dingy, lo-fi element that makes it hurt that much better.  The closing track, \\"zero-Sum,\\" is particularly amazing, a subdued anthem cut through with all manner of clicks, hiss and pops--think maybe of Tom Waits gone digital and you're halfway there.  The overall effect of the album is often jarring, but if you're into the noisy likes of, say, Chrome, \\"Year Zero\\" is like taking a comforting acid bath.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and that whole concept album thing.  The \\"story,\\" such as it is, never intrudes upon the music like rock operas of the past.  There are no overtures or between-song skits.  While there are definitely some moments of piano-laced beauty, the album is mostly straight ahead (but bleeding edge) electro rock.  Reznor's lyrical inspiration isn't hard to decipher, even if he never utters the word \\"Bush.\\"  Actually, it's amazing that for such a horrible president, Dubya has inspired any number of strong political statements, bot direct (Green Day's [[ASIN:B0002OERI0 American Idiot]]) and indirect (My Chemical Romance's [[ASIN:B000I5Y8ZU The Black Parade]]).  Trent Reznor in particular might want to thank the man perssonally for inspiring the most vital and relevant album of his career.  And they say irony is dead.a subdued anthem cut through with all manner of clicks, hiss and pops--think maybe of Tom Waits gone digital and you're halfway there.

B0009R1T7M|4.0|when i first listened to this cd my first thought was, \\"why do people like this crap?\\" how did this cd get rated one of the top of 2005? <br /> <br />after giving it a couple of listens and looking into some of the lyrics i realized why. this cd is definitely something different. stevens is an excellent storyteller and a musician with a lot of crazy ideas that actually work.  <br /> <br />not a perfect 5 because i feel like the guy is too genius, such that his music is too random for normal people. a lot of his ideas and lyrics go way over my head.  <br /> <br />memorable tracks (shortened names for convenience): <br />concerning the UFO sighting - excellent opener, showcasing his strange piano and choral arrangements along with his ethereal voice. <br /> <br />john wayne gacy, jr. - i had to look up the guy on wikipedia. a very haunting song based on a tragic true story. <br /> <br />casimir pulaski day - love and loss. <br /> <br />decatur - just plain catchy. <br /> <br />chicago - epic in its full arrangement. <br /> <br />the predatory wasp - a story of reminiscent and adolescent love. excellent pacing, with a very well-arranged wind section. <br /> <br />if you really appreciate artistry, not just pop music, buy this cd.
1582701709|5.0|I first saw the video The Secret in October 2006. Shortly after that I bought the book here on Amazon.com.  I was inspired to write a book myself to take The Secret to another level.  I used THE SECRET to create the next generation book about the Law of Attraction.  The Law of Attraction led all the right people to me to make this new book a reality. Within 3 months the book was completed and ready for publications.  Three weeks after completing the book, it is already available on Amazon.com.  That is THE SECRET in action!<br /><br />Bruce Goldwell, co-author \\"Mastery of Abundant Living\\"
0440241030|5.0|Reading The Hard Way, I was struck by the evolution of Jack Reacher, always superbly confident, always superbly capable.  Fallible though -- his fear in the tunnel in Running Blind, the bad cops who get the drop on him in Without Fail.  But in THW, we see Reacher at his peak.  Immovable.  Unstoppable. Invincible. <br /> <br />Reacher, alone in the dark.  Waiting. <br /> <br />Sweet.

B000O178BY|5.0|What I really love is the audacity of the album. Electronic bleeps and white noise mixed with underlying melodies that weave together a tight and top-notched concept album. Of course, this is no doubt the sound of Nine Inch Nails---loud, energetic and vigorous. But this is a brave record. In the time when you see the War in Iraq and global warming, the dystopian future that depicts in the album seems possible, and how many of us is willing to think about that? And the brilliant ARG campign...that was certainly innovation and daring. <br /> <br />Yes, there's a lot of Bush-slapping nowadays, but no one did it the way Year Zero did. It's not rooted in 2007, so it wouldn't (shouldn't) sound dated in a few years. Though the concept itself isn't all that original, the fact that it was brought to life in the ARG and in the record is enough. And no, you don't have to be spent hours at the ARG sites to enjoy this album. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks (for me) include \\"The Good Soldier\\", whose catchy melodies and splashing drums builds with subtlety until the guitar drones in the end. And I also love the lyrics in the song, it's not bashing the soldier, but walking and understanding the solider. <br /> <br />\\"Vessel\\" is nothing short of a computer melt-down, with big beats, eerie sounds and crackling noise. I love it. <br />\\"Capital G\\" with a very interesting vocal delivery, its blaring bass line is groovy and funky.  <br />\\"The Warning\\" with its out-of-tune guitars is certainly memorable, while \\"God Given\\" is also groovy, and yes, I am tempted to sing along with the song. <br />\\"Meet Your Master\\" and \\"The Great Destroyer\\" is ferocious while you can still hear the melodies.  <br />While quieter moments like \\"In This Twilight\\" and \\"Zero-Sum\\" is nothing short of gorgeous. Also, Reznor step up a notch on this album (see In This Twilight). <br />An interesting thing to me is, this album somehow gives me some sort of----dare I say optimism, hope in the end. Was the story really anend or just another beginning? I would like to think the latter. <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|This is probably the best album since the Downward Spiral in 94. It gets better with every listen and I find more and more I love about it at an alarming rate. The sound is definitely different, but the signature riffs and  warped instrumentals give just the right amount of chaos in the music. Thank you Trent for supercharging NIN once more.
0743270754|5.0|It's been a long time since I've picked up a book on history that I simply could not put back down. Usually I have gotten into the habit of reading a nonhistorial book as quickly as possible, because there was so little in the writing to savor. In fact, the last biographical books or books on American history have either been in journals suchas American HIstory, or in books written by David McCullough, and though I deeply admire his works on John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and theodore Rossevelt, I did not manage to get through his books on these outstanding forefathers the way I managed to get through this very long book about Lincoln.    My family tends to collect lincoln memorabilia thanks to my deceased grandfather, but he gave that collection of pamplhets and books and drawings to me. When I was in grade school during the 1960's I remeber trying to listen to programs on the Columbia Broadcast System concerning American history with the rest of my classes. Unfortunately, as one of the first profoundly deafened students in a regular public school in CA, this information had limited use for someone like me, so I regularly checked out books to make up for the information that was being talked about over the system which I could not get. This just served to whet my appetite for linoln. Eventually we moved to Pittsburgh, and did a lot of sightseeing of the Lincoln monuments and his time period, which I enjoyed imensely. So I gained an immense respect of my own for this magnificent leader (albeit flawed as a man), just as all of us are flawed, no matter how much good we performed under stress.     The men surrounding Lincoln were a unique group. A few years ago, Tom Brokaw, a broadcaster, wrote another great book about the generation who survived the Great Depression and World War II as being 'The Greatest Generation.' I always wanted to argue with that statemtnt, as I considered the founding fathers of this country loaded with a number of wonderful statesmen and profound orators who were able to take a new land and unite it into country with common interests in freedom of choice in almost every part of their lives. The generation of WWII also preserved and continued that practice, but those men who guided our country during the time of its greatest need were those who responded from their families and warm beds to fight to preserve the union and to allow all who entered our country to be free to engage in religous practices with tolerances, as well as giving us the right to enjoy religion freedom and educational and work opportunities.     This book was an outstanding buy, and definite keeper for those of us who write. There are some questions that I would have like answers for in the end, but of course, many of those thing are available online...    Karen Sadler
B000O178BY|4.0|One of the wonderful things about music is it is something we each individually process and react to in different ways. Reading the other reviews here shows how true that is.    I think this is an excellent album and I am glad it didn't take five years to put out something after With Teeth. My favorite NIN is The Fragile, but other favorites are The Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine, With Teeth, Broken etc (basically all works). They all get a lot of spins on my CD player or IPOD. On any given day my thoughts on which release I like more will change (usually based on my mood). What doesn't change is this is a Hall of Fame artist putting out another excellent piece of work. Listening to this, there are bits of all the best of his previous work.    I enjoy just about every track on this CD. Me I'm Not, Vessel, Survivalism, The Great Destroyer, Zero Sum, My Violent Heart, Meet Your Master, The Beginning of the End and even Capital G.     I hear a little of all the previously mentioned works in Year Zero. It's the same artist so that doesn't surprise.     If you like NIN, you are going to like this CD.     Make no mistake, this is an excellent CD. It may even become YOUR favorite.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|Avril has so much talent, none of which is in her latest cd.  Any cheerleader at any highschool in America could have written and sang (cheered) all these songs.  Pretend your listening to some old Mandy Moore, and you'll love it.  But if your expecting the Avril like you know her, I wouldn't recommend the cd.
B00004YA8W|1.0|Why ruin a classic movie such as EL CID by releasing this extremely poor quality print.  No only is the print spoilt with blemishes it is not even in original screen ratio.  A few years ago Martin Scorsese oversaw a restoration of this epic film bringing it back to original 182 minute running time with re-mastered sound and picture.  This version was issued on Laserdisc and has been on sale in Hong Kong on a dubbed DVD for quite sometime now.  Originally released by the Rank company I don't know who owns the rights now but surely SOME enterprising DVD company could make a killing by allowing fans of the film to purchase a full Special Edition of El Cid and how about Fall Of The Roman Empire which has also been treated badly on it's DVD release
0671015206|3.0|This book takes 200 pages to explain the reason why wealthy people are weathly, its becuase they are fugal and most are self employed.  I don't think it should have been that many pages for such a simple concept most people already know (by common sense).  The more you save the more will be in your pocket.  Nothing special about that. <br /> <br />Read this if you have time, otherwise I'd look for a more usefull book.  This book will be a \\"good\\" to read on my list, but not a book I'd recommend first for those looking to be wealthy or wanted to be exposed to strategies of the wealth.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|This is the album Maiden fans have been expecting since Seventh Son, but it's also the hardest one to review in the band's history. On the plus side, we see a unique and strong concept for the songs and cover (war and religion), a distinct never-seen-before-in-Maiden prog sound, inspired songs and an end to that repeating the same chorus to exhaustion that we saw in BNW and DOD. On the con side, the slowstart-getsheavy-endsslow throughout the whole album can get in the nerves and if the mood is not right you can't stand listening to it. <br /> <br />Xcept for the pseudo ballad Out Of Shadows, all songs are individually outstanding and capable of featuring on any Maiden album. And you have the impression that they will be even better and more powerful when played alive. But you end up wishing that some were shortened and started with a heavy riff for a change. On the musician side, stars are Bruce singing like The Prisoner with new tricks and Nicko drumming like Neil Peart. The rest of the band sounds strong as ever, but you wonder when they will do triple solos, since they have 3 G-men now, and why they did not allow Adrian to use the \\"commercial\\" inspiration that gave us Prisoner, Run To The Hills, Flight Of Icarus, Aces High, Two Minutes, Wasted Years, Evil That Men Do and The Wickerman. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I love the album, but I end up listening to it less than BNW and DOD, because it depends so much on my mood (and a long commute) for me to really appreciate it. Well, here are the songs for a detailed look in: <br /> <br />DIFFERENT WORLD - one of the best openers for Maiden, joins the hard rock feeling of DOD's Wildest Dreams with the quality of BNW's Wickerman and a chorus from Thin Lizzy. 9/10 <br />THESE COLOURS DONT RUN - starts the long prog pieces, great chorus, aggressive singing, the bridges between solos could be less dull. 8/10 <br />BRIGHTER... - absurdly heavy riff from Adrian, will scare off some Black Metal fans, great lyrics, againagressive singing, a little repetitive chorus though. 8/10 <br />PILGRIM - Egypt meets Maiden adds complexity , great guitar intro, second shortest song, Bruce kicks a**. 9/10 <br />LONGEST DAY - you feel right into Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan's first 15 Minutes. This is awesome, a long proggy song, with emotional lyrics and singing that will send shivers through your spine. 10/10 <br />OUT OF SHADOWS - downfall here. Joins Tears Of The Dragon with Wasting Love to a worse result than any of them. Not bad, but not on Maiden level. 6/10 <br />REINCARNATION... - the most original single ever, and a great one. A slow deathly start with \\"enigmatic\\" lyrics, heavy and hooky guitar riffs, awesome Brucelike chorus and catchy simple solos. Need more? Personally, I believe that Benjamin Breeg is an alias for Eddie, ie, the band -> check the lyrics. 10/10 <br />GREATER GOOD... - Best song in the album, a classic right now. Epic, singalong bridges, hammeringc chorus, you can't make it better no matter how you try. 10/10 <br />LORD OF LIGHT - Again a great song. Slow and dark start, a heavy rock'n'roll riff starts a journey into the dark side of God, aggressive singing, solos all around and some guitar bending and vibratoes never sae in Maiden before. 9/10 <br />LEGACY - mix of Medieval acoustic guitars, bombastic keyboard moments and some aggressive singings, but electric guitars are a little downplayed here. Great ending for the album and a nice innovation from Maiden, like DOD's Journeyman. 8/10   <br />  <br />PS: check Saxon's new Inner Sanctum album, it's absurdly good.
0743454537|4.0|Great beginning. I found msyelf flipping through pages in middle. Ending was wrong...left a bad impression. <br /> <br />Great storyline, however. I loved Jesse and Campbell.
006112429X|2.0|I was attracted to the theme of this book, but the author makes you work excessively hard in getting to the core. This book could have used a redraft and/or a good hard edit - I was struggling to get through it and skipped quite a lot of it. Not because I have a short attention span, but because of the repetition and focus on boring minutiae, which I don't think adds anything to the story. I'm not sure whether the author thinks her readers are unable to grasp subtleties therefore need everything spelled out for them, but I feel this could have been fixed with further drafting - it really has the feel of being a little undercooked. Better editing would have also fixed the misuse of many complex words and phrases, which you do not expect to read when the format is letters from a professional travel writer (the narrator). All power to the author for winning the 2005 Orange prize and achieving success in a tough market, but I would not rush out to read her other books.
0393061434|4.0|I'm a big Apple and Steve Wozniak fan, so of course I quite enjoyed this book. <br /> <br />You can certainly tell it's actually Woz writing, as the writing style seems somewhat amateur.  <br /> <br />He also shows a bit of hubris in this book -- which is a little disappointing as I always romanticized him as very humble and down to earth.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|This movie was about poor decisions more than anything else, and their consequences in foreign lands.  It reminds me of Crash, but wasn't nearly as heavy-handed in its message.  Then again, nor did the eventual connections between the four seemingly disparate story lines resonate as much- the links are pretty tenuous, and once they were revealed, I thought, \\"So what?\\"  Particularly pointless was the Japanese storyline, although it was interesting and kept me in suspense before it let me down.<br /><br />The entire movie was very well acted, and the healthy number of novices gave the picture an authentic feel.  Big names like Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett kept their egos in check and were just a couple more people in the mix, struggling to face the challenges this world can offer the unprepared and unsuspecting.  There is a lot of pain in this film, and the actors in Babel sold me every ounce with their performances.<br /><br />The landscapes were beautiful, too, and help to convey the desolation and helplessness that pervades the entire film.  National Geographic might as well have provided the footage, it was so gorgeously shot.
0439813786|5.0|I bought this book at the suggestion of a shopkeeper in a darling little local bookstore who really knows his stuff. From the mere bulk of it, as well as the cover, I would never have dreamt that my little girly girl [...]daughter would adore it. We read it together on a flight from Chicago to Los Angeles...read it in the car from Los Angeles to Palm Springs (I had to keep stopping because I was getting carsick)...and finished it when we arrived at our hotel. My voice was hoarse! My husband, age 40 and usually only interested in Clancy type or business books was glued to my every word, and I had to keep holding the book up to see the pictures! At one point my daughter went to the lav on the plane, and I found myself peeking ahead. IT'S THAT GOOD!    :)
B00000IQW3|5.0|I have a soft spot for this movie, and when it came out on DVD I immediately bought it.  I must have watched it dozens of times when it was on HBO in the 80s.  Watching it again so many years later, it still retains its heart and charm.  Sure, the effects may seem very dated but the film stands out as as one of the first to use CG-created ships and environments.  Everyone in the film does a great job as well.  Robert Preston is excellent as the smooth-talking alien, Centauri.  Dan O'Herlihy has a great time playing navigator Grig, and star Lance Guest has two roles, one of disenchated teen Alex Rogan and the other an android double that takes his place while Alex is taken into space to train as a Starfighter.  Guest seems to have a lot more fun with Beta, the android role, but makes Alex believable as someone trying to break free of the trailer park where he grew up.  (Don't forget Catherine Mary Stuart as the love interest). <br /> <br />The specials features are a welcome addition for fans.  I watched every special feature on this DVD the day I got it, and enjoyed learning about the making of the film from the documentary.   <br /> <br />This movie is a great bit of nostalgia with a lot of heart.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|... is one of the most unique horror/sci-fi features I've ever seen. The movie start off a little slow, which is not bad at all because it is setting up for what is to come. The story: a Tall man who works at the mortuary is stealing dead bodies to turn them into slaves...the Tall Man is truly creepy and scary. I love this series (Phantasm) because of their continuity--the second one picks up exactly where the first one left off, and the third one picks up where the second one left off. A great film. If you don't already have it in your movie library, then you are missing a must have.
B000IU3XTM|2.0|I loved \\"O\\" but \\"9\\" is a poor follow-up.  Not one track lives up to the standard of his first album.  Damien seems to have run out of melodies and the lyrics are often pretentious and immature. If you are discovering Damien Rice for the first time, I recommend starting elsewhere.
B000001ELR|5.0|This is definitely the powerhouse album Kiss wanted. From the opening of \\"Creatures...\\" to the final chords of \\"War Machine\\" it is obvious this was a very focused and well produced album by a band on a mission. Not one weak link in this line up. I think that this was also the real unveiling on Eric Carr to the world as to how much of a dynamo he was behind the drums. He does play on 'The Elder', but he really is unleashed on this one. His drumming dominates the album, and in a way that does not overshadow or drown out the rest of the band. As far as the guitar playing goes you really won't miss Ace. He'll always be the original and considered their best, but on this album the session players(to include Vinnie Vincent) greatly filled the void left by Ace's departure.  <br />The heavy style of playing would be continued on their next album, 'Lick It Up' and would reemerge on 1992's 'Revenge'. Unfortunately, for the latter, Eric Carr would not be around to perform due to his passing, from cancer, in 1991. <br />This album ranks as my #1 Kiss record.
B000O178BY|5.0|<br />I suppose we all may like different aspects of Trent's music; I, for myself at least, can see how he's grown and changed... and will always be excited to hear what he will come up with.  <br /> <br />Another reviewer (R. Swift \\"rachel helene\\") said the engineering and production on this album is 'exquisite'... those two elements are arts in themselves. In addition to those, his arrangements and modifications of sounds could very well be called genius.. with so much detail and texture, not to mention depth; whenever I put my headphones on to give the first listen to whatever his most recent work may be, I feel that I'm entering a new world... and that's exactly what each of his albums are. I believe a large part of his appeal comes from this fact. <br /> <br />I become frustrated from reading reviews whose criticisms are based on the fact that his new album 'is different' compared to previous efforts, and therefore 'bad' because of being different. Because they, the listeners, are looking for a particular specific sound, they will write reviews chock  full of negative remarks regarding the new piece because they harbor an obviously biased sentiment.  <br /> <br />These people don't appreciate artistry.
B000O178BY|4.0|I'm being very kind with my review. I'm also going to make it shorter than my review for With Teeth. Musically speaking, Year Zero is quite an achievement. Its like a Drum and Bass Noise-Rock Electronica masterpiece, that is until the forgetable (and boring) singing takes the music in a different direction. Half the time he is just talking on this album. It also doesnt help that the lyrics are self-centered opinions and cheesy concepts. I dont expect Trent to be angry anymore, but I was hoping that he would be able to make his vocals and lyrics stand apart from everyone else like he always did in the past. I almost cried when I heard the vocal delivery on Capital G. Bottom line is this: the music is fantastic, prolly the best brooding noise/electronica I've heard in almost a decade. However, the vocals are trite and boring, nothing you havent heard from a million other boring bands. I never though I would say that about NIN. Everyone's got an opinion on the world yadda yadda yadda. I agree with the others that said this would have been fantastic as an instrumental album. I guess Year Zero(and With Teeth for that matter) would have had a better turn-out had Trent stuck to singing about internal darkness and the human condition. Politics and concepts make for tedious listenings. I don't see the next one being better. That is all.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I purchased this box set because of course, I love the show. The only gripe I have is the cardboard, or hard paper dividers that's used to cup the DVD's actually scratched the discs... Not bad enough to affect the play though, but if I ever wanted to re-sell this box set in mint condition somewhere down the road, I can't now.
0743454537|1.0|I read this book when it first came out...the premise was intriguing, what would it be like to be created for a specific purpose...one that was a constant source of pain.  What if you got fed up and said no... <br />  <br />****CAUTION SPOILERS**** <br /> <br />Only it was painfully obvious to me that that was never the case here.  Anna was compelled to stop this, it wasn't her idea.  The fact that the we hear everyone's voice Anna's, Mom's, Dad's, Lawyer, Brother, Advocate,(in different fonts, so we wouldn't get confused) and never Kate's was a dead give away.  Kate was obviously behind this and it would have been as good a story...better possibly if we heard her instead of her cowering behind her little sister. <br /> <br />The sledgehammer 'You get to grow up' forshadowing, lead no room for doubt, Kate wasn't going to die, Anna was.   <br /> <br />But my biggest problem with it was Ms. Picoults insulting implication that everyone is stupid.  Am I wrong to think that most people realize that there is more than one type of service dog?  I get that that was supposed to be funny, and lead to the dramatic court scene, but it was stupid.  Every place they go someone points out that the Lawyer isn't blind. <br /> <br />I didn't care about anyone but Anna and the service dog in this...The ending was a cop out and stupid, but the EPILOGUE is what clinched it for me.  The transplant that Kate didn't want, wasn't sure she'd live through, cured her...no more luekemia for Kate, she's going to live to a ripe old age.  It's not irony, its dumb. And her arsonist brother becomes a cop or firefighter and never pays for killing someone.  I don't remember or care what happened to her parents or the lawyer and his true love the advocat.   <br />
0393061310|5.0|This book while tough to get through at times is meticulously researched and will give you an amazing idea of how societies survived and thrived through the ages. The obvious that we take so much for granted, food, tools, shelter and the animals we raise are the links to civilizations that have disappeared and those that have flourished.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|This movie is just a bunch of abdominally endowed guys running around using witchcraft. Nothing wrong with that; but I was expecting a more interesting plot.  <br /> <br />The story just seems too hollow, and leaves too many questions unanswered. This could have been a very good movie if the characters had been given a bit more depth, history, and substance. <br /> <br />The only reason I give this film 4 stars is because of all the good looking actors.
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|I have her 2 previous releases, and I like them both very much.  Her 3rd album is one of those \\"same but different\\" type of deals.  I say this in a very positive way.  If you enjoy her music in the past, I think you'll be pleased with this.  I read a review and saw someone state Target and walmart only carry the edited version.  This is not true in Targets case.  I think one of the reasons I enjoy Avril's tunes are the use of the electric guitar , especially in the chorus of many tunes.  Puts me in mind a little of Joan Jett. A few of the tracks made me think of Blink 182. And there was one track (sorry, typing from memory and don't remember name), where I swear I picked up a slight guitar sound from an 80's track.  I always enjoyed the more rocker type female artists of the 80's (I'm 33, I know, kind of weird), and Avril kind of takes me back, her stuff is catchy, it rocks pretty good, and for the most part light listening.  I haven't watched the dvd yet, but the cd is great. I've listened to it str8 through twice, and it's all good.  There is one line that is laugh out loud bad though. She says at the end of a verse \\"I'm the one that wears the pants\\", then again loudly \\"I\\"M THE ONE THAT WEARS THE PANTS!\\", the way she emphasizes pants is hysterical. Too bad I doubt she intended it that way.  I think any Avril fan should go snag a copy, and I think this album will also create new fans.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review. P.S. I hate to be the 1st one not to give it 5 stars, but the \\"Pants\\" line has to drop it down one, lol. Recording that in the studio, she should've known that was WAY corny!
0736063684|5.0|From what I've seen so far, this book is a pleasure to read. There are many, many (and I mean it) many illustrations in color and b&w and these are not grainy photos but drawings of high caliber. They illustrate the  different muscles that are worked out while you exercise. I hope they make a PDF version. Books are so outdated on this 21st century and I hate to keep bookshelves full of them when I can carry hundreds of books on my computer's hard drive. Are you listening Human Kinetics?
1573921394|5.0|...you're not a real person. If it was not for this wizard's brilliant insight on how to create prosperity with a little math and a little monetary expansion, there would undoubtedly still be poverty in the world today.  It's not just a book, it's a religion. And it's the best religion.<br /><br />Verdict: Read it at least twice.
0783241569|5.0|Of course in real life this would not happen, at least not to me. William, owner of a small bookshop in Notting Hill, not only falls in love with a Hollywood star Anna Scott (played by Julia Roberts who is virtually playing herself), but also he really begins to go out with her. Can an ordinary guy be the true love of the star whose face covers magazines every week? Here is a one story, delightfully romantic and told with humor, about the possibility of such a romance. The story sounds implausible, but still a very good one. <br /> <br />Despite some incredible situations, the chemistry between the two leads makes us forget them temporarily, and their romance is enchanting (and a bit predictable) to the end. In addition to Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant (and their undeniable star power), the film is supported by gifted actors playing colorful characters; they are Gina McKee, James Dreyfus, Emma Chambers and inimitable Rhys Ifans as Spike, the most unusual lodger in London. Amusing cameos of Alec Baldwin, Matthew Modine and young Mischa Barton as child actor (like she was then) shoud not be missed. <br /> <br />Pleasant romantic comedy \\"Notting Hill\\" is written by Richard Curtis, whose works before this one include equally romantic \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and less successful \\"The Tall Guy,\\" both of which are based on the American-in-London situations. His script of \\"Notting Hill\\" is always witty, giving us some sly comments on human relations and film industry. (In fact, I am using it as the text for my English class in Japan.) <br /> <br />Some people may say this is not real Notting Hill (you don't see Notting Hill Carnival, for example) and probably they are right because, as I said, in real London this would not happen. It belongs to the ever-overcrowding genre of romantic comedy where romance means a lot, and in this respect \\"Notting Hill\\" is a success.

B000MV9026|5.0|A wonderful movie! Personally, I think some reviewers need to get over themselves and stop reaching so deep for ways to feel righteous. If you want to expose your kids to caring about animals and finding positive solutions to environmental problems then this movie is influential - certainly way more healthy then exposing them to the violence and human cruelty of everyday tv. Regardless, this movie is worthwhile, a joy for animal lovers (like me) and I hope to see more like it in the future.
B000O178BY|3.0|Part of what made Nine Inch Nails one of my favorite artists 12 years ago was the fact that all of their albums were extremely different than the other. \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was WAY ahead of it's time, so much in fact that by the time \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"With Teeth\\" came out, they were slightly disappointing because we had come to expect that kinda genius from Trent. None the less, I still absolutely loved both albums, but I've been waiting for a NIN album to come out that just does something totally different than he's ever done before...\\"Year Zero\\" does that.<br /><br />This album offers little to no radio anthems, much the way \\"Spiral\\" did. There's no live drums and almost no guitar, so the majority of the album is a lot of heavy electronic noise. It's like hearing a NIN remix album before hearing the album that its remixing. This album legitimatly captures the way music could sound many years into the future, and back in '94 this is definitely how I imagined NIN sounding in the future. NIN has always been a band about progression and experimentation, that's what made them great in the first place. But there are a lot of fans out there who don't really get the band, and they'll be saying things like \\"Where is the dark angry p*ssed off Trent?\\" Or \\"Where are the metal songs like Wish and March Of The Pigs?\\" They might even say this is the St. Anger of Trent's career. I admit that this will not go down as one of my favorite NIN albums, it might even be my least favorite. But it's still very good and I'm just glad to see Trent step outside the musical box that he created back in '94.<br /><br />\\"Hyperpower\\" is the first track and it's just sort of a minute and a half intro for the album and I think it's the only track with live drums. \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" is the next track and could pass for something from With Teeth...it also reminds me of the song \\"Metal\\" from the Things Falling Apart remix album. Then there's the album's first single, \\"Survivalism\\". I didn't think much of this song at first, but it didn't take long for the catchy chorus to get stuck in my head. \\"The Good Soldier\\" is sort of an \\"Into The Void\\" type tune with a mellow beat.  \\"Me I'm Not\\" sort of gets things going into the strange direction of this album, it sounds like it could've been a song by Tricky.  Then there's \\"Capital G\\" and this will probably be the next single. It has a VERY catchy beat and the chorus is sorta like a pumped up version of \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same.\\"  \\"God Given\\" is a standout track to me, sounding like a very industrial, very dark version of Prince.  \\"Meet Your Master\\" has a bass hook kinda like \\"Where Is Everybody\\" and could possibly pass for something from The Fragile or With Teeth. \\"The Greater Good\\" is sort of an instrumental except for some occasional whispering from Trent, and it contains some Fragile-era sounding piano.  \\"Another Version Of The Truth\\" is a creepy sound loop with an old piano playing in the background.  \\"In This Twilight\\" is one of the most interesting tracks in terms of Trent's singing, it's very hypnotic.<br /><br />Again, I'll admit this isn't Trent's best album, but it's great to see him evolving again. To enjoy this CD, you kinda have to forget all you know about NIN. Or imagine NIN if you put them in a blender with Radiohead and Tricky.  I will say this though, not since Pretty Hate Machine has NIN put out such a good CD to have sex to.<br /><br />Standout Songs:<br /><br />The Beginning Of The End<br /><br />Survivalism<br /><br />The Good Soldier<br /><br />Capital G<br /><br />God Given<br /><br />Meet Your Master<br /><br />In This Twilightdn't think much of this song at first, but it didn't take long for the catchy chorus to get stuck in my head. \\"The Good Soldier\\" is sort of an \\"Into The Void\\" type tune with a mellow beat.  \\"Me I'm Not\\" sort of gets things going into the strange direction of this album, it sounds like it could've been a song by Tricky.

B000O178BY|4.0|There's a lot of hype around this new NIN album, implying that Trent Reznor has returned to his core strengths after a couple of albums of drifting. The reenergized and reinvigorated workouts here surely make that claim true, but beware of seeing this as totally a good thing. This album is a real improvement over the unfocused With Teeth, and it's amazing that Trent only needed two years to create this new slab. He's obviously been inspired by some dreadful personal run-ins with the current political regime, like being told not to be too partisan at the MTV awards, or suffering damages from Hurricane Katrina. Hence, Trent has been recharged both musically and lyrically. The soundscape on this album is a generally strong combination of the gothy electronica of Pretty Hate Machine and the brutal deathmarches of The Downward Spiral. Trent has also added a few (though not many) new advancements on top of this solid foundation, particularly the disturbing goth dirge \\"Me, I'm Not\\" and the downright creepy instrumental \\"The Greater Good.\\"<br /><br />However, while Trent's musical attack has been rejuvenated, and this album is more fun to listen to than the last couple, little else here represents any real advancement. A few songs here are tragically obvious rehashes of old NIN sonic strategies with diminishing turns - including \\"Survivalism,\\" \\"Vessel,\\" and \\"God Given,\\" among many others - which suffer from the same backward-looking lack of focus that wrecked most of The Fragile. Further trouble arises with tracks that are obviously meant for mood-setting purposes only, and don't operate effectively on their own, including the quick opener \\"HYPERPOWER!\\" and the inconsequential ballad \\"Another Version of the Truth.\\" Meanwhile, Trent has again failed to rewrite the classic \\"Hurt\\" in the form of the obligatory heartbreaking album closer - this time it's the dreary and disjointed \\"Zero-Sum.\\" As for the lyrics, Trent makes an impact with his anti-neocon polemics, dystopian visions, and tales of personal political struggle, but most of his opinions will be terribly familiar to free-thinkers and political contrarians. Thus the lyrics here are almost politically brilliant and insightfully subversive, but take on an general vibe of predictability. As for this album's overall impression, in a truly bizarre turn of events (though maybe not so unpredictable), the once ultra-futuristic Nine Inch Nails has become a retro act. Trent still rules the roost that he himself created, but sheer innovation is yielding to dependable entrenchment.

B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is one of the best thrillers ever made, and if 12 years later you still haven't seen it then you have missed a fantastic film.<br /><br />Its a simple story - two detectives start investigating a series of murders that increasingly seem to relate to the seven deadly sins - Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. As the film progresses the film gets darker and darker, and its only at the very end that detectives, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), realise that they have been pawns in a bigger game.<br /><br />The cast, which also includes Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow are very good and the script is brilliant. Take nothing for granted in this film. Believe me if you haven't it already seen the film, the ending will leave you fairly surprised (I think thats an understatement!). The director is David Fincher who also made Fight Club and Panic Room.<br /><br />The film is grisly and quite repulsive in places. Although described as a mystery-thriller on the back of DVD case it has enough unpleasantness to be classed as horror-horror. So don't buy if you are easily spooked, or have a weak stomach!<br /><br />The extras on the 2 disc special edition are well worth watching and amount to another 163mins worth of material.
B000002J2B|5.0|Wind and Wuthering is one of Genesis's very best albums and it came out at the peak of the band's musical perfection. It is a much more mellow sound than we heard on previous albums but it still manages to be very exciting. It will leave you in a state of shock and awe. <br /> <br />Eleventh Earl of Maar starts the album off in an ominous, rumbelling way. I would go as far to say that this is the best opening in any Genesis album. This is the most energetic song on the album and it depicts the story of a Scottish Earl as told by his son. The main parts of the song were written by Mike and Tony, and the quiet middle section was Steve's. A great song all around. <br /> <br />One For the Vine is one of Tony Bank's greatest masterpieces. Soft yet ominous, this opus details the story of \\"the chosen one\\" though his adventures. The music is brilliantly written and preformed; Phil's vocal is perfect. For over ten minutes this song winds you on an incredible musical and lyrical journey. <br /> <br />Your Own Special Way is a sweet balad written by Mike Rutherford. It is superficially a simple love song, but in reality it is about a captian singing to his ship, seafaring being a common theme in Mike's work. It is a delacate and beautiful song with a very gentle and relaxing keyboard solo in the middle. <br /> <br />Wot Gorrilla is an instrumental bridge that follows YOSW. The song is essentially a jam in 7/8. It is nice to listen to but nothing special. <br /> <br />All in a Mouse's Night is another of Tony Bank's works, a somewhat comical song about a mouse excaping from humans and a cat. It's a very fun song. <br /> <br />Blood on the Rooftops is Steve's main album contribution, with Phil helping to write the chorus. It begins with a beautiful acoustic guitar intro and proceeds into a gental melody lamenting the sad shape of the world as seen through the TV news. A great song. <br /> <br />Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers In That Silent Earth is essentially one song brokeninto two tracks. It is probably the only Genesis song that can be classified as psychadelic. The band plays creatively and creates imaginitive imagery as the song weaves along. <br /> <br />And finally we come to Afterglow. Simply the most stunning and beautiful song ever written. It was created by Tony in a single stream of conciousness. It is amazingly simple yet absoultely perfect in any way. The lyrics of the song create the most beautiful poem I have ever read. It brings tears to my eyes whenever I hear it. An absolute masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br />Wind & Wuthering will always hold a special place in my heart. I reccommend it to anyone who wants to hear really good and beautiful music.
B000002U8G|3.0|Why this is not recognized as Pink Floyd's chef d'oeuvre is beyond me.  There is more in the 45 minutes of this album to justify the Floyd's enshrinement in the pantheon of rock godhood than all of their subsequent output combined.      To begin with, there is \\"One of These Days.\\"  The doubled bass tracks (Echo-plexed and stereo-tracked to swirl from left-to-right and back) anticipate much electronic music -- witness ABBA, Morcheeba, Massive Attack, Moby, Oakenfold, Radiohead, Zoot Woman, etc.      \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" showcases the dreamy Hammond organ stylings of Rick Wright and the acoustic guitar part-writing of Dave Gilmour.  If this track does not stand as tall as the rest of the album, it is only because it is an oak amongst redwoods.    \\"Fearless\\" is the first great demonstration of Roger Waters's obsession with insanity, self-regard, and schizophrenia, later to become de rigeur on \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Wall\\", and \\"The Final Cut.\\"  Its creepiness is bolstered by the crawling octave figures in Dave Gilmour's guitar part, which seem to illustrate, in musical terms, the narrator's growing paranoia and dissociation from the world around him.  \\"You'll never walk alone,\\" indeed.  Actually, you may walk alone over the cliff of madness, but at least your precipitation therefrom will be accompanied by a Gilmour guitar-figure.    \\"San Tropez\\" follows on insanity of \\"Fearless\\", and actually turns out to be its reiteration and intensification.  The reprieve from Watersian dissociation is merely a hazy, cocktail-inflected hour of jazz.    \\"Seamus\\" diverts from the atmosphere of dreariness which has begun to take root.  The stage is now clear for the quasi-symphonic titan which concludes this album.    The hydrophone pings which begin \\"Echoes\\" bely its outer-space origins -- the starting couplet of which originally went \\"Planets meeting face to face/Hang motionless upon the air.\\"  The opening, in a sort of Handelian French-overture dotted rhythm, eventually gives way to an extended funk-rock workout (with much bending and releasing from the ever-fertile Gilmour and chopping and draw-bar manipulation from the Hammond-frying Wright).      In all, \\"Echoes\\" moves strength to strength, proving itself to be the reason for buying \\"Meddle\\", pushing 70s progressive rock from the realm of curiosity (or straight classical paraphrase) to actual direct musical expression.      When you have finished the album, the feeling is one of accomplishment, or that of having flown over a large, wide-horizoned vista.
B000002J2F|5.0|Duke is the highpoint of the three-man period in my opinnion. From the opening of \\"Behind the Lines\\" you get the feeling that you are in for a powerful, fast-paced, electric album full of grandeur and excitement. The second song \\"Duchess\\" is one of my favorite Genesis songs. There is some kind of electric excitement which carries this song, which is about the carreer of a female singer. <br /> <br />The album is bookended by the Duke Suite, which is comprised of Behind the Lines, Duchess, Guide Vocal, Turn it On Again, Duke's Travels, and Duke's End. The Duke Suite is the best material on the album, with Turn It On Again becoming an unlikely rock anthem, and Duke's Travels which is the band's most eletrifying and exciting song since the Cinema Show. Duke's End quotes Behind the Lines and Turn It On Again to end the album in a thematic ramp. <br /> <br />Filling the rest of the album is a number of notable songs made equally by each of the band members. Duke was the first album that Phil showed equal songwriting prominance as Mike and Tony. A lot of the songs on the album have to do with relationships and their breakups and they are done very well. The album also includes a major hit \\"Misunderstanding\\" written by Phil. <br /> <br />All in all Duke is a great album, the best of the three-man era. If you like Duke, check out the three member's solo albums released around the same time: Mike's Smallcreep's Day, Tony's A Curious Feeling, and Phil's Face Value. Three brilliant solo albums that focuses on each member's individual talents that were pooled together to create Duke.
B000002KZ6|5.0|The Talking Heads' 1983 album \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" is a dazzling, groove-oriented collection.  The music here is so impeccably crafted and paced that you're truly left in awe, that is if you're not busy simply dancing and/or singing along.      The album is remarkably cohesive, yet intriguingly varied at the same time.  The massively funky \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\" has one of the most insanely catchy choruses ever, plus hilarious vocal asides from David Byrne.  \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\" and the huge hit \\"Burning Down The House\\" are ultra-funky gems as well.  \\"Slippery People\\" has an incredibly catchy gospel-ized call-and-response chorus, sumptuous bright keyboard textures, and a neatly 'off-the-beat' bass line.  The swinging \\"Swamp\\" is fittingly titled, with a swampy New Orleans R&B groove, Byrne singing much lower than usual, and an amusingly growling singalong chorus.  \\"I Get Wild/ Wild Gravity\\" has a light reggae feel and yet another irresistible chorus.  The closing \\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\", with its memorably looping guitar line, has a weirdly optimistic tone and is a wonderful way to end the record.    In short, \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" is a marvelous must-have record, from a terrific band, that any serious music fan will want to listen to over and over and over.  One of my all-time personal favorites.
B000002J1O|5.0|There are many good albums out there. A small number of those good albums can be called \\"great\\" albums. Amoung those Great albums is an even smaller elite, and amoung that smaller elite there is an album that still stands out as a giant. <br /> <br />Selling England by the Pound is that album.From the first note to the last, this is a work of absolute magestry and brilliance.  <br /> <br />The first song, Dancing Out With the Moonlit Knight features a sorrowful melody describing the death of \\"good old England\\" as it is replaced by a commercial, modern England. Peter's brilliant vocal delivery is matched by brilliant guitar work of Steve and Mike. Tony and Phil enter, and the song builds and builds to a loud, busy, and wonderful instrumental climax. <br /> <br />I Know What I Like is Genesis's first pop song, featuring a catchy melody and quirky lyrics about a family's life as seen through the eyes of a lawn-mower sitting on the porch. A neat song. <br /> <br />Firth of Fifth is quite possibly the best song ever written. It begins with a fast, powerful keyboard solo by Tony Banks and launches into a grand and magestic verse. The song features a flute solo, another keyboard solo, and one of Steve Hackett's most well-known guitar solos. The arrangement is brilliant, the musicianship is flawless, and all five men are at their best. <br /> <br />More Fool Me features Phil on vocals for only the second time in Genesis. It is a sweet little diddy about the ending of a relationship apparently written by Mike and Phil on the steps of the studio while waiting for the other guys to arrive. It is nocked by many Genesis fans, but not this one! I think the song is a sweet addittion to the album. <br /> <br />Battle of Epping Forest is a song about a gang fight with refferences back to mideval England. There are some very interesting vocal dynamics and several good instrumental spots. This is not one of my favorites, though many people love it. <br /> <br />After the Ordeal is a little instrumental track mostly written by Steve. It is nice and pleasent but overall unremarkable. <br /> <br />Cinema Show is quite possibly the other best song ever written. From the opening guitar chords you are lulled into trance that will bring you back to the days of anchient Greese, to the days of Romeo & Juliet, and then send you right up into the night sky to travel amoung the stars and view the very face of God. That's how good this song is. After a great lolling six minute start, the song breaks into this five-minute keyboard solo that is one of the most breathtakingly-beautiful things I have ever heard. It's hard to believe it was written by a human and not by some kind of angel. <br /> <br />Aisle of Plenty brings about the conlcusion of the album reiterating the vocal theme and making sly refferences to English grocery story chains, and at the very last fadeout you can hear Peter reading his shopping list. A brilliant closer to a brilliant album. <br /> <br />In conclusion, Selling England by the Pound is quite possibly the best album of all time. If you don't have it, get it as fast as you can.
B000000WI6|5.0|I own all of his studio music with the exception the older sub-standard stuff  which he was just a sideman,making 'qquestinable' music for su-standard peple. Well worth thr price of admission for track'Life is hard. There are so many superb tracks, the playing is stellar and the vibe between the contributing musicians is top-rate. Highly reccommended. Best place to start for this under-rated blues genius!Brilliant.
B000002J2D|4.0|And Then There Were Three is, as the title suggests, the first album made by Genesis after they were cut down to a three-peice. It is evident that they had not yet quite decided what direction they were going to in the album, but at the same time there are a number of good songs. <br /> <br />Tony and Mike each wrote about half of the album, Phil only helping on a couple of the songs. Both Tony and Mike wrote some very good songs and some just okay songs. For me, the highlights of this album are \\"Undertow\\", the instrumental section of \\"Burning Rope\\", \\"Deep in the Motherlode\\", \\"The Lady Lies\\", and finally \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\", that last song being the band's first big pop hit. It is a beautiful song-the best love song they ever wrote. <br /> <br />Though this album wasn't as good as it's amazing predescessor Wind & Wuthering, nor as good as its successor Duke, it is still a very good album and it is a worthy addittion to any collection of good music, an essential for Genesis fans.

Great for young kiddies and middle-aged people alike. What I love the most is that they are not 'over the top' with technical gimmics (guess they did not have too many back then), like that 'groan' over-used 360 degree slow-motion pnaing the bullet through the air (enough said)--Highly enjoyable and it's flaws add to it's wonderful charms--not pristine, not clinical mega produced hype--just good clean
B000002NZO|4.0|The last album to feature Anthony Phillips, Trespass is a unique and wonderful album. Though the band has not yet reached the mastery they would see with Nursery Cryme, they already managed to become accomplished musicians at 19-20 years old! One of the highlights of the album is Stagnation, a very looked-over Genesis classic about a post-appocolypse world. A beautiful vocal rendition by a young Peter Gabriel. The other highlight is, of course, the Knife, a song about a violent revolution in which the revolutionaries of today become the dictators of tomorrow. This song is the closest Genesis has ever come to heavy metal. <br /> <br />Overall Tresspass is a great album and there is not too much bad to say about it other than the boys were still growing to the perfection that they would see on the next few albums. A definite must-buy.
006079383X|2.0|I am an eager reader of books on Warren Buffett's investing methods. I really want to like \\"The Intelligent Investor\\", but I don't. Unfortunately, Benjamin Graham did not write his books to be timeless. Instead, he wrote them specifically for the investing environments as they existed at the times of publication. This audiobook is of the 1972 edition of \\"The Intelligent Investor\\", and it reflects the investing environment of the early 1970's. <br /> <br />The story of Mr. Market and the principle of \\"a margin of safety\\" are important concepts contained in this book, but they can be found in other writings by and about Warren Buffett. <br /> <br />There is an updated edition of \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" by Jason Zweig. It was published in 2003. Hopefully that is better than the older, outdated editions. It is not (yet) available in audio format. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good audiobook on Warren Buffett's investing methods, I highly recommend \\"How to Pick Stocks Like Warren Buffett\\" by Timothy Vick. The best book on Buffett's investing methods that I have read is \\"The New Buffettology\\" by Mary Buffett, but it is not available as an audiobook.
076790382X|2.0|I hope it is not a back handed compliment to say that this book belongs in the bathroom. But the consistently short length, the consistent formula and somewhat repetative nature of Mr. Bryson's musings are not the stuff of a long sit down. While his perspective as an American coming home after 20 years abroad is refreshing in his humor, I found the collection more dated and tedious than funny. There were several moments of out-loud laughter, but just as many times I though to myself, \\"I've read this before...I know what he is saying...I recognize his writing style and formula.\\"  <br />So I recommend this as a sometimes book. Of the 70 short essays, many are insightful and wise-the one on why trees leaves change color comes to mind-and others fun. They are best experienced in passing glances.

075640407X|5.0|It's hard to believe that this fantasy is Patrick Rothfuss' first novel.  The story is so rich and filled with detail that the characters really came to life.  Since this is the first in a trilogy, I am relieved to know there is more of this story coming. <br /> <br />This is essentially an autobiography told by quiet innkeeper Kote to a traveling scribe named Chronicler.  Kote is really the famed hero known as Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe the Kingkiller--who has been thought to be dead.  When Chronicler recognizes him, he persuades him to tell the tale of his life, stories known far and wide, though much altered and embellished in the retelling.  <br /> <br />We hear of the small boy traveling along with his family in a troupe of entertainers.  We learn of the hardships of a slightly older orphan struggling to survive on the streets of a crime-infested city. And we celebrate when he manages to enter the university where he wishes to learn many of the aspects of magic, but mainly how to control the wind, and to discover the truth about the Chandrian who killed his parents.  But life at the university isn't easy for one with quick talent, and Kvothe soon learns the power wielded by those with wealth.  It is a story of love, loss, and heroism. <br /> <br />In the background to Kvothe telling his story is the current threat to the community where he is now living.  Questions are left hanging as to the purpose and identity of the attackers. Kvothe believes it is his fault and that only he can stop them. <br /> <br />Rothfuss creates a world so vivid that it is easy to step in and become part of it.  At 662 pages this book appears intimidating but I found myself profoundly disappointed to see it end. And, I am really bummed I have to wait a year for the next one from this talented writer.
B000O178BY|3.0|Probably NIN's best album since the Downward Spiral. Works great as a concept album and is a must have for paranoids who believe the government is plotting against them. Great tracks, far superior to With Teeth (which didn't have any) A return to form for Reznor, doesn't pull punches and has some great sounds and even better lyrics. Only complaint is a throw away track that's just sound and not real music or lyrics, I hate when musicians do that crap. Highly recommended for 21st Century listening pleasure.
B000O178BY|5.0|All you are about to read was conjured up before I read other reviews, or was exposed to any other related medium. Its based on my listening \\"feel\\" of this outstanding piece of work. <br /> <br />This album is unlike any other NIN in that its not about personal ghosts and torments. Its about all of us, our collective guilt in part-taking in this relentless feast of global destruction. <br /> <br />Its darker and more hopeless than any other, becuse it captures that feeling of anxiety, shame and embarassment when you suddenly realise you have made a really bad decision, and its far too late to prevent the disastrous consequences. Its is gagging with that desperate panic of discovering too late that the inevitable is already happening. <br /> <br />The boat to safety has already left, and you are not on it... in fact you missed the call to board long ago...  <br /> <br />Sonically its impeccably produced as always, and has a more \\"raw\\" and organic feel than previous nails. Its however not an instant winner, like all great music it requires listening time to digest.
0192853619|5.0|Like many mathematicians, I often wish that I could give my non-mathematical  acquaintances a better idea of what I actually do, and I was hoping that this book would serve that purpose.  However, this book isn't so much about what mathematicians do and why, but rather about what mathematics is, i.e. what certain basic mathematical concepts mean.  The first 7 chapters roughly cover the following topics: <br /> <br />1) What does it mean to use mathematics to model the real world? <br /> <br />2) What are numbers, and in what sense do they exist (especially \\"imaginary\\" numbers)? <br /> <br />3) What is a mathematical proof? <br /> <br />4) What do infinite decimals mean, and why is this subtle? <br /> <br />5) What does it mean to discuss high-dimensional (e.g. 26-dimensional) space? <br /> <br />6) What's the deal with non-Euclidean geometry? <br /> <br />7) How can mathematics address questions that cannot be answered exactly, but only approximately? <br /> <br />The eight and final chapter makes a few remarks about mathematicians. <br /> <br />The writing is spare and beautiful.  For each topic, the book takes just enough space to give the reader some food for thought, then moves on.  I especially liked the middle four chapters.  I would definitely recommend this book to students in lower-division undergraduate math courses who are curious about or puzzled by the above questions. <br /> <br />The book touches on some philosophical questions.  In doing so, the book flies close to some subtleties (such as Godel's theorem and the Banach-Tarski paradox) without acknowledging them (which is reasonable enough for a Very Short Introduction).  Also, one can argue with some of the philosophical statements.  For example, is mathematics discovered or invented?  The author espouses the axiomatic approach (which is pretty much how mathematics is written), whereby mathematicians invent the rules and discover the consequences of the rules.  I would want to emphasize that these rules are not completely arbitrary, but often there is some intuitive notion that one is trying to capture.  In this regard, here are two specific statements in the book that I take issue with:  1) The author argues that i does not have a Platonic existence, on the grounds that one could replace i with -i in all mathematical statements without changing anything.  OK, but if this is supposed to imply that complex numbers are invented rather than discovered, then I am not convinced.  2) The author suggests that in teaching students who make mistakes such as x^(a+b) = x^a + x^b, it might be good pedagogy to introduce exponentiation axiomatically and then deduce facts such as x^3=xxx from the axioms.  However I think that if one does not already understand that x^3=xxx, then working with exponentiation axiomatically will just be meaningless symbol manipulation, of the kind that I encourage beginning calculus students to unlearn.  I think that it makes more sense to build up a solid understanding of what x^n means when n is a whole number, and only then generalize. <br /> <br />Anyway, the nitpicking in the previous paragraph should probably just be regarded as evidence of the thought-provoking nature of the book. <br /> <br />The author has posted a number of additional essays on related topics on his webpage.  These tend to be a bit more mathematically advanced than the book, but not too much, and are also good reading.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|If ever a band was a victim of their own success, it is Arcade Fire.  Their debut album, FUNERAL, was not merely the best album of 2004 but certainly one of the definitive discs of the decade.  I got this album the day it came out and have been listening to it repeatedly since then, but only now felt comfortable reviewing it.  Is it as good as FUNERAL?  No.  Is it less than a great album?  Again, no.  If Arcade Fire had never released FUNERAL this would easily be among the half dozen most acclaimed albums of the year.  As it is, it fails ever so slightly to reach the heights of their debut.  But if you can just get their initial masterpiece out of your consciousness for a bit, the considerable merits of this superb album will arise.<br /><br />Some disappointment was probably inevitable.  After all, with a single album Arcade Fire became one of the most highly regarded albums in the world.  Their debut in many leading music festivals was as the headliner, unheard of for a band with only one album under its belt.  The miracle of NEON BIBLE is that while it isn't the masterpiece that FUNERAL was, despite the almost impossible expectations placed upon them they managed to produce what is unquestionably a very, very good album.<br /><br />If FUNERAL was spiritual in its focus on death, NEON BIBLE is flat out religious.  Nearly every song has a religious or quasi religious theme, made even more obvious by the brilliant use of a pipe organ on several cuts, in particular the wonderful \\"Intervention,\\" which concerns the horror of someone so deeply devoted to religious duty that they ignore the very real needs of those most dependent upon them.  Win Butler's voice perfectly expresses the sentiments of every song.<br /><br />I love that in this album the band has tried to stretch and expand its sound, experimenting with new arrangements and supplying even more beautiful back up vocals than in the debut.  There is prodigious effort put into almost every song.  Unlike FUNERAL, which absolutely blew me away the first time I heard it, this album took me quite a few listens to fall in love.  When I finally did warm up to it, I was amazed at how many good things there were in it.<br /><br />The main reason NEON BIBLE isn't quite up to FUNERAL is that while the latter had not weak cuts, the former is not stellar from beginning to end.  The best cuts are as breathtaking as anything on the earlier album.  \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\" sounds like it could have come off the debut.  But \\"Intervention\\" and \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" two of the album's best cuts, cut new ground.  Keeping the automotive theme going, \\"No Cars Go\\" is another great cut.  My favorite song on the album is, however, \\"(Antichrist Television Blues),\\" though I have to confess that I don't get the parentheses.  The way that the acoustic guitars dominate provides an unusual sound for the band and lays a great foundation of Butler's spectacular vocals and the, as usual, marvelous background singers.<br /><br />There is nothing more difficult for a band than producing a second great album after having started with a masterpiece.  These guys are enormously talented.  I think that expectations for their third album will be somewhat lessened and I believe that with less pressure on them that they will produce another great album.  And it should be acknowledged just how much great music is coming out of Canada.  There have always been some great performers from our northern neighbor, from Neil Young to Gordon Lightfoot to Joni Mitchell.  But right now the shift seems to be from individual performers to bands.  I'm not sure that the United States right now can boast three bands as good as Arcade Fire, the New Pornographers, and Sloan.  I anxiously await their next album.  I earnestly urge everyone to get this album.  But be patient with it!  Most will need some time for it to get under their skin like FUNERAL did.UNERAL, which absolutely blew me away the first time I heard it, this album took me quite a few listens to fall in love.

0345349571|5.0|Even a brief summary of all Barbara Tuchman's themes would lead to several pages.  A Distant Mirror tries to describe the major political and religious machinations of 14th century Europe. Her constant is Enguerrand Coucy VII, a prominent noble, kingmaker,diplomat and warrior of the time. Coucy attracted Tuchman's attention because of his atypical eminence. He was one of the few lords who was not deceitful, barbaric, vainglorious or libertine. The times forced him to make some crucial choices as to which king and pope deserved his support. (He chose French in both cases.) But, his thoughtfulness, sincerity and success as an honest broker and fierce commander enable him to stand above the dreadful examples of humanity that attempted leadership of the 1300s.  <br /> <br />This was a time when provincial warlords struggled for power and influence. Many knights were mercenaries or roving brigands. Church corruption was entrenched. Commoners were overtaxed to pay for wars, crusades, tributes or ransom. The Black Death kept the population well below levels of the previous century. An exasperating aspect of this history is how little most of the principals learned about governance or warfare. They were continually arrogant, parochial, greedy and treacherous.  <br /> <br />Ms. Tuchman's history encompasses scores of characters- most of whom I will never read of again. I do wish she had put the most notable into a brief biographical compendium so the reader could refresh his memory as to their particular deviance. One of the pleasures of A Distant Mirror is reading Tuchman's acerbic comments about these horrid people and their times. I will close with a typical Tuchman comment regarding the Christian kings' defeat by the Turks. They were trounced because most of the warlords wanted singular recognition for heroism and refused military cooperation.  \\"Vainglory, however, no matter how much medieval Christianity insisted it was a sin, is a motor of mankind, no more eradicable than sex. As long as combat was desirable as the source of honor and glory, the knight had no wish to share it with the commoner, even for the sake of success.\\"
B000NA1OXY|1.0|This is the edited version of the CD.  To get the unedited version of the CD, you have to up the extra money for the deluxe package with a worthless DVD on the making of this album.  This marketing ploy is unfair to all Avril Lavigne fans.  I was extremely upset to have to pay the extra five dollars today to get the version of the album I wanted.  If Avril had anything to do with this, piss on her!  Go to itunes and pay what you should for the proper songs.  I can't believe I am suggesting something like that.  It's just sad.
B000MTPANQ|3.0|This is a great CD of some of Young's best music, all done in acoustic fashion.  The sound quality is pretty good, too.  But the DVD was a waste of time and space.  It would've been great if we actually had video of all the performances, but we don't.  I haven't actually counted, but it seems as though half, if not more, of the songs don't have any live video at all.  All you get is a great soundtrack with a video camera wandering around on a stage pointed at a chair with a running reel-to-reel deck on it.  (For those of you born in the 80s and beyond, a reel-to-reel deck was the preferred recording medium at the time of this release in the early 70s.  You might remember cassettes, and maybe even 8-tracks, but good quality reel-to-reel decks provided a much better sound than either of those two inferior offspring.) <br /> <br />Given the low price I paid for this release, I was still satisfied with the purchase.  The CD of the show is worth it.  Great songs, great sound.  But if you're looking for a good Neil Young DVD, this ain't it.

B000O178BY|5.0|After becoming absorbed in the alternate universe created online for this album, I can honestly say that listening to the culmination is nothing short of orgasmic. Trent manages to embody each of his characters heartbreakingly well. When combined with a return to all of the brilliant sonic elements that truly made NIN so fantastic, this is masterful. Reznor has conceptualized a film... a novel... a Tolkien-esque REALM, and presented it to the listener with the music recorded here.  <br /> <br />I'm particularly won over by the familiarity in some of the melodies and chord changes. I think Reznor takes some of the musical patterns from past works and integrates them seamlessly here to create something new and stunning. <br /> <br />In short, I am genuinely floored by Year Zero... and I haven't even listened to it blazed yet.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was looking for a pair of lightweight headphones to replace the ear-buds that came with my MP3 player.  I am a small person and most ear-bud headphones feel like I'm jamming soda cans into my ear canals.  Unfortunately, most traditional headphones are also too big and fall off when I am running.  Someone recommended this pair of headphones to me, and I'm so glad they did!  The fit is perfect, and the sound quality far exceeds what I was expecting for the price.  I am so happy I finally found headphones that sound great AND fit!
B00005JPCF|1.0|<br />I bought this movie for toddler, although I had heard that the story was not good, I though she would like the music and the dancing (she loves music) I was sooo wrong! I was expecting either catchy kidie songs or the musical type. Instead the soundtrack consists of great classics, but manny of them are not appropiate for little children and most are butchered with arrangemets \\"ala Chistina Aguilera\\". <br />Besides that, some characters seem to sexualized and, is it my imagination or Mumble really slaps Gloria on the but while dancing?.  <br />I am not a conservative, but I found this movie to have messeges and/or portails of intolerance, indolence, bad parenting, sexualized behavior and stereotyping, among other things. <br />And besides, the story is bad.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Comeon its Napoleon Dynamite. The price of this DVD is justified by all the great quotes or the dancing at the end if nothing else.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Avril's 3rd album is crazy cool. It's fast and upbeat and is over too soon. Every song is fun and uplifting. There are 3 ballads and everything else is fast and heavy on the drums and guitars. This music is the stuff that makes you wanna get up and dance. She is trying new things and it has turned out great. It's loud and all about girl power. Some people on here seem to be upset that it's not like her 1st album, but do you really want to listen to Complicated #2 or would you rather listen to something new and fresh? The dvd that comes with the cd is fun and you get to see her behind the scenes. I actually watched the dvd first and I loved it. The only complaint I have is that there are some songs that aren't included in the cd. Like Alone is a B side to the single Girlfriend and I will Be is only on iTunes. Other than that it's something that every Avril fan should own.
B000O178BY|5.0|Compared to the consistent sound of Reznor's previous records, this one is certainly a departure.  More beat oriented,less guitar textures, and verse chorus verse.  He seems more confident and less dark, vocally.  Different, but a good listen.  I am not going to analyze the sequences, but it is a new direction for Trent, and this album takes a few listens to appreciate.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|This is an AWESOME Package!! It's the complete package that every singer should have!!! A Making of their CD to show how awesome idea's are born. This CD/DVD comes with Audio and Visual treats for your senses! As well as \\"Limoncello!!\\" &lt;--Awesome Stuff!!!
B00007BHOE|5.0|Slipknot decimates. (I could really leave it there, but I'll go on.) I am a huge slipknot fan, I saw them in concert, it was unforgettable. I am also a huge Disturbed and Stone Sour fan, in fact I listen to Iron Maiden too. Don't stereotpye the rest of us simply because you are too close minded to appreciate more than one narrow strip of a genre of music. By the way, if you like Stone Sour, you must like \\"Get Inside\\" and if you like \\"Get Inside\\" how can you not like sLipKnOT!!?? Oh, and one more thing, I sing along with all of the songs, I have no problem understanding the lyrics, maybe your mind is just too slow.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Everyone seems to hate Fred Durst, but when this came out it was the biggest album around, this is the album that really made nu metal mainstream, korn's freak on a leash brought it to every one's attention, but this is one of the best albums ever made, debuted at no.1. Nookie, RE-arranged, and break stuff are the best three song combo you could ever put together, every song on the album is solid and could be used as a single, i thought they couldve done without n together now, but other than that its solid. One of the best ever made no matter what anyone says, it spawned a whole genre
B000007UNK|5.0|Apart from being one of Madonna's finest songs of recent years, despite the fact that it was written by Bjork, Nellee Hooper and Marius DeVries.<br /><br />This particular single release from the UK comes in a \\"glittery/metallic\\" type sleeve which changes colours depending on how you hold it to the light.  Contains the Junior Vasquez \\"Sound Factory Dub\\" which is only available commercially on this release.  Like the \\"Ray Of Light\\" 3D cover and the \\"SEX\\" book, this is a \\"must-have\\" for all serious Madonna fans and collectors.
0743298020|5.0|A great story. Vida Winter is an intriguing character.  This author has been compared to Bronte and Austen.  I agree.  With more intelligence. <br />
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out in the theaters. Being Indian and watching it at such a young age was definitely a memory I will never forget. I've seen it since over a dozen times and love it every time. I was ecstatic to see they finally made a two disc special edition one and grabbed it. This movie will live on for centuries, and I really think it's high time someone makes just as symbolic a movie of Martin Luther King Jr. so that children of this time can have a movie to cherish for in centures to follow!
B000002I4S|5.0|The 1960 release of Atlantic's `Giant Steps' was the first album featuring Coltrane performing all original compositions. Listeners become absorbed into the marvelous sheets of sound he belted out with such professional ease. Speedy execution and marksman-like precision brought Coltrane the envy of both his peers and fans. Sweeping solos spout from Coltrane's horn on here, accomplishing what a lesser musician plainly could not. `Giant Steps' races to the borders of harmony while the ballad `Naima' slows the mood down and heats things up. This CD version includes bonus alternate takes which Coltrane had rejected in favor of those featuring Tommy Flanagan.<br /><br />Personnel for the tracks `Giant Steps', `Cousin Mary', `Countdown', \\"Spiral', `Syeeda's Song Flue' and `Mr. P.C.' on the original LP:<br /><br />John Coltrane (ts), Tommy Flanagan (p), Paul Chambers (b), Art Taylor (d).<br /><br />Personnel for the track `Naima' on the original LP:<br /><br />John Coltrane (ts), Wynton Kelly (p), Paul Chambers (b), Jimmy Cobb (d).<br /><br />Many of the alternate takes that never made their way on the album feature Cedar Walton on piano and Lex Humphries on drums.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|My girlfriend and I debated over who would be the better Bond - Clive Owen or Daniel Craig. While I'm a fan of Owen, I was intrigued by the choice of Craig, and am happy to say that his casting was inspired. Remember the first shot of Sean Connery lighting his cigarette? Daniel Craig shows you how Bond came to own that smugness. Remember when Bond coldly shot Professor Dent in the mountain-top bungalow? Craig brings every bit of that ruthlessness to the role. Craig plays Bond like he ought to be.<br /><br />The movie itself begins with some brilliant action, and then settles into the poker game which keeps one on the edge of the seat, in a way reminiscent of Hitchcock. The stakes are high, the tension is real, and the release is cathartic. And you may already know that the last scene leaves you ready to go back to the beginning...<br /><br />The special scenes are great, too. I was fascinated by the story about flipping the Aston. Enjoy!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|\\"Is you Is, or is you ain't\\" ... great Jazz opening from Anita O'Day.... <br />If you liked it the first time ((or didn't get it the first time...)) watch it again.  It gets better with each repeat.  Excellent work by all involved.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|When I went to see Grindhouse last week and Tarantino's offering to the genre began, I knew I was going to want this soundtrack the moment Jack Nitzsche's \\"The Last Race\\" started to play.<br /><br />I would honestly give this disc a five star recommendation as it is just as good as any of QT's other film soundtracks. There are some great songs that I had personally never heard before listening to the cd and Smith's \\"Baby, It's You\\" is a pleasant discovery. There's really not much more to say other than this disc is a solid purchase and easily recommended.
B000MVQ9P2|3.0|\\"The Host\\" is a South Korean monster film. And I'll state up front that I am not really into monster flicks. I like suspense, thriller and horror when it comes to these types of genre films, however, the primary reason for my purchasing the film was because of actor Kang-ho Song, who gave a gritty portrayal in his role of the bereaved father in Park's \\"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.\\" However, I like quite a lot of Kang-ho Song's films, and I believe that he is a very great actor, no matter what role he is portraying. Also, I believe that no matter what the failings of this film, he gave a very good acting performance in this film. As did many others. Moreover, for those who like monster films, I can see where this film may appeal to you, and would probably merit a 4 to 5 star rating.<br /><br />Kang-ho Song's character in the film reminded me a little bit of Takashi Kitano in his role as Zatoichi [\\"Blind Swordsman\\"] due to his blonde hair. Also, I couldn't help being reminded of the film \\"Tremors\\" while viewing the film, even though there are many differences. Part of this for me was that the film had some pretty funny scenes in the beginning, middle and ending of the film. In particular were the at times humorous and funny interactions of the family members who are trying to locate the missing child of Song. I don't wish to give out too many spoilers in the film, or give another rehash of the plot. However, for me the film was definitely a family-centered film, where the creature takes a backseat: But not too far back!<br /><br />The film does have some suspenseful moments, especially at the beginning while the specatators are leisurely relaxing on the banks of the Han River. And I must admit, the film takes off pretty quickly in the beginning. There are scenes that really pull you into the film at the start. And although I did not think that this was a great film, it was not a failure by any means. It was an enjoyable film to watch. However, I would recommend that viewers rent the film first to see if it is your type of film. The film does not takes itself too seriously--especially when you watch the family, before, during and after the search for the abducted child. I thought the film was going to be more serious, however, it was still an enjoyable watch. Not great, but watchable. The film is average, to above average. More importantly, however, is that it is a fun watch. Recommend that you rent it first before purchasing. [Stars: 3.5]ilm first to see if it is your type of film.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|\\"Not Too Late\\" is a laid back, relaxing album perfect for long drives in the country or unwinding at home.  However, the album avoids being simply a relaxing piece of work by embracing serious themes on occasion, employing unusual instrument choices, and presenting many different moods, some more playful, some more dark.  And, most important, throughout the course of this CD, Norah's voice, intonations, and delivery are as great as they've always been.  Though some reviewers here have found \\"Not Too Late\\" to be a little too low-key and maybe even a little dull, I really enjoy it.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|i bought this cd expecting retrovertigo and pink cigarette type pop songs from mr bungles california cd.. instead what i got was a bunch of beat oriented pop songs like you would hear on mtv (think justin timberlake) mixed with a bit of hip hop/electronic (think beck) . although there are still traces of pattons craziness that make this cd unique. and this cd is catchy as hell and doesn't get old. i can put the cd in, put it on shuffle, and listen for hours.  what i really liked about this cd though was the beats and contributions by the guests artists. this cd introduced me to quite a few beat makers that i enjoy and has caused me to branch out into a whole area of music i haven't really listened to much before (underground electronic,  beats, etc.)   patton fans may be disappointed if they expect mr bungle or fantomas, but if you learn anything from patton it's to expect the unexpected and this cd doesn't disappoint, plus it's a lot more accessable to the average music listener than other patton projects. is it pattons best and most unique work? no , is the 5 star ranking i gave it mean its one of the best cds ever? no, but it's better than almost anything else out there today and a good listen. 4.5 stars i'll give it and i'm looking forward to future releases to see who he collaborates with next.
B000O178BY|5.0|I put this album in my computer to add it to my iTunes and I left the room.  When it was done ripping, I came back and took it out and noticed the disc was white.  I thought I was losing my mind.  I even asked someone who saw me open it \\"the disc was black, right?\\"  Then I noticed it was a heat sensitive disc.  Go me.<br /><br />Anyway, this album is really amazing.  It seems to be a step up from his 2005 release, \\"With Teeth.\\"  As everyone else will say, this album touches back on NIN roots and sounds less organic.  So I'll save you the monologue...<br /><br />Just go buy it.
B000003TA4|4.0|I like Nirvana, and I understand the influence they had on mainstream music, but I can't say I love their stuff as much as others do. Nevermind is a good album, but it's front loaded, and just doesn't have that something that makes it great. You can totally see all the ways their sound is replicated by other bands, but I don't find any of them to be terribly interesting either. Cobain's raspy vocals fit with his dark-natured guitar playing and lyrics, and he's a talented musician. But I think he's put on too high of a pedestal just because of how his career ended. <br /> <br />\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is considered by many to be the best song of the decade, and one of the best ever. It's good, to be sure. It might just be hard for me to put it in context, having heard it for a long time without really knowing much about music when it was first popular (I had just turned four when the album was released). It's followed by four more good grunge songs I've heard before, and then six that I haven't. None of it's bad, it's just a little boring after the first half. The last track has the earliest instance I know of a hidden song after several minutes of silence. It goes with the whole album, respectable, high quality stuff, not quite what I'd call amazing.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|Avril Lavigne proved, with her debut LET GO, that she had what it took not only to be a pop star, but to be a real musical artist.  Her follow-up, UNDER MY SKIN, had her delving into deeper, darker material, putting her in a more alternative-minded suit.<br /><br />Apparently, she had enough of that.  THE BEST DAMN THING is spunky, perky, happy-go-lucky sing-a-long that, definitely, is catchy as hell, but isn't near as good as what Lavigne can do.  \\"Girlfriend\\" kicks off the album and sets the mood; several of the tracks sound like knock-offs of this tune (including the title track, on which she boldly declares \\"I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen\\").  Ironically, with a couple exceptions, Lavigne sounds at her best when she's in this spunky mood (the exceptions being the powerful ballads \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Keep Holding On\\").<br /><br />Basically, this is an immature album from an artist we know is capable of mature material.  She hints at it here and there (\\"Damn that boy can make me cry,\\" she sings in \\"Contagious;\\" in the next verse, \\"Damn that boy can make me smile\\").  But basically, THE BEST DAMN THING is THE BEST DANCE THING, because that's what it'll make you want to do--dance.  Lavigne's got a good voice on her, and she knows how to write a well-crafted song; hopefully, her next album will show her branching out.  This album makes her out to be the \\"pop princess\\" persona she so adamantly defied earlier in her career.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth is a metal band, but Damnation is not a metal album. It is the second half of a broken up double album, and is almost purely progressive rock. Deliverance, which was released about six months earlier, is supposed to be one of their hardest records, and this is quite a counterbalance to that. Opeth is known for switching between hard and soft moments, and that's part of why I liked Ghost Reveries, but without that, they are free to just let the softer stuff do what it wants, and it becomes a more enjoyable overall record. Despite his growling, he can definitely sing, and they don't seem out of place doing music like this. <br /> <br />\\"Windowpane\\" proves you can be good at regular guitar playing and fast-paced metal shredding. The more downplayed musicianship is combined with creepy sounding ambiance and strong vocals, and this combination is heard throughout. My favorite part is the end of \\"Closure\\" which combines different kind of music to create an awesome sounding groove that could last forever if it wanted to. The whole thing is a bit brief compared to their other stuff, which makes some sense considering it was once just half of an album. It's quite entertaining while it lasts, and shows how much range a band can have.
0743496728|5.0|After the disappointing \\"Tenth Circle\\" I was apprehensive about Jodi Picoult's latest offering, \\"Nineteen Minutes.\\"  I needn't be.  It's a great book and timely, given the horrible tragedy at Virginia Tech.  The story revolves around a high school shooting by a boy who has been mercilessly bullied his entire school life.  The other characters include his parents, schoolmates, and the police and court officials who must deal with this crime.  The characters are authentic and the story totally absorbing.  I found it hard to put this book down.  It ranks as one of the best from Ms. Picoult.

B000O178BY|5.0|I've listened to NIN for a long time, loving the layers within the songs, the seemingly fearless prose put public and the musical 'noise'.  Now this.  I realize that this will sound corny, but I really don't care.  There is an overwhelming need for me to say Thanks for the creation of this cd.  All the frustrations, truths, fears, terrors and hopes of our times are encapsulated on this disc.  I am amazed.<br /><br />This cd is for everyone.  Those who love that NIN noisy rhythmic sound will be pleased, others who love the mayhem and violent sounds of NIN will be pleased, and for everyone who wants to stand against what is happening in our world - you will cherish this work of art.<br /><br />I don't want to describe this album more than that, as you need to hear it on your own.  Thank God this guy is still around and is making music.  Esp music like this.  Yet, I do wonder whether Trent's pants need an extra big pouch in the front to house those big ones.  I don't recall any other artist taking this strong of a stand.  Thank you Trent.
B000O178BY|4.0|Thank you for not taking so damn long to put out another album since you last one. And thank you for a \\"return to form\\" (clich&eacute;d perhaps, but true in my estimation) albeit in a new direction. Not since The Downward Spiral have I enjoyed one of your albums so much. I have to admit that though I like With Teeth, I don't love it, and it has not gotten a lot of play in my CD player. Well baby, that has change with Year Zero. Political and Social issues aside, it is a great concept for an album and a great sound. I actually like Capital G, contrary to another reviewers take, and it is the most \\"poppy\\" of the songs on this expansive album. I really love the sound textures that are explored, and the music itself really engages me. I would rank it up there with Downward Spiral and Pretty Hate Machine, my two favorite NIN albums, though it has a more \\"Broken\\" feel to it in places. It edges out The Fragile for my 3rd favorite, and it well ahead of With Teeth (sorry Trent).<br /><br />All in all, I like this new direction stylistically and musically. The lyrics are an improvement over With Teeth as well. Keep experimenting, you seem to find your muse that way. Superbly engineered, excellent audio quality. Bring on the sound collages and I look forward to hearing what follows. But for now, my ears are feasting...<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars ...I'm hoping the best is yet to come.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, I've been listening to YZ for over a week now and it is still a rewarding experience. Some may say it does not have the depth of former albums but to you I say, keep listening. I am finding new things to hear on every spin, and the songs are growing on me even more -- getting under my skin. Truly a complete work, I journey through it then want to hit repeat to take the journey again. YZ also got me to throw With Teeth back in my CD player and I have to say that I am appreciating it more than I used to.<br /><br />While I found Year Zero almost immediately accessible, that by no means makes it simple and I am do discover new things with every listen. Don't compare it to previous works and enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />UPDATE (013108):  I've had this album for a while now and it just keeps getting better with repeat listens.  I discover something new in each song, some subtle variations that are revealed only after many spins.  A good sound system helps too.  This is far from being just noise -- it is an expertly crafted sonic landscape.  I am really looking forward to YZ Pt.2.

055357342X|5.0|Could George R.R. Martin be related to J.R.R. Tolkien?  Let's look at the facts:<br /><br />They both have two \\"R\\"s in their names.<br />They both wrote exceptionally well-written and detailed fantasy.<br />They both wrote a fantasy series that got better and better with each book.<br /><br />That last statement is certainly true in the case of \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" which is the third book in Martin's \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series and follows [[ASIN:0553573403 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]] and [[ASIN:0553579908 A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 2)]].  This is not a standalone book.  If you have not read the first two books, you have no business starting here because you will only be confused.  So, assuming now that you are experienced with this series, I will skip over expounding on Martin's literary merits and simply say that this book is better than it's successors.<br /><br />As usual, the main draw to this novel is its unpredictability.  I should have known better after all the characters Martin killed in the first two novels.  This book is no exception, as he continues to off MAJOR characters and take the plot in directions that the reader would never have considered.  A Storm of Swords focuses heavily on Jon, Tyrion, Jaime, Arya, and Daenarys, and there is no lack of action or deceit. I am a very slow reader but this book was so fast-paced that it only took me about 3 days to finish what would normally last me a month.  The interesting thing is that by focusing many chapters on Tyrion and Jaime, Martin gives us their viewpoints of the past events and I found myself actually empathizing with the Kingslayer.  At the conclusion of the book, I've found that I have no idea who the \\"hero\\" and \\"villain\\" is in this novel.  The correct answer is that there is none, which is just the way Martin would like it.  Even Sandor Clegane, possibly the most evil character from the first novel, begins to earn a bit of respect from the reader.<br /><br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" does not have any of the climatic battles from the previous book, but will rather appeal to those who are more interested in the political intrigue and backstabbing that goes on among the characters.  My only frustration with it is that Martin will end a chapter with a climatic event, and the reader is forced to wait several more chapters to pick up with that character again.  But maybe this is what makes it such a fast read.  Anyone who enjoyed the first two books will like this one even better, but be warned, many of the main characters in this novel do not even appear in the fourth book [[ASIN:055358202X A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire)]], and will not be picked up again until book five, A Dance with Dragons.of the climatic battles from the previous book, but will rather appeal to those who are more interested in the political intrigue and backstabbing that goes on among the characters.

B00004Z400|4.0|Of all the bands stuck with the reviled nu-metal label, Deftones was one of the first, and it didn't do them any favors. They aren't like some of the other bands known for it, who inserted mediocre rap vocals and highly computerized and studio-perfected sound. They do have a bit of rap on the opening bonus track, although it's not obstructive and is pretty cool because the chorus is recalled in a different way on the album's final song. The hard rock music is decent, but the reason I really like Deftones is the vocals. The guy can sing, and his high voice contrasts in a very nice way with the crunching guitars. <br /> <br />He can scream as well as sing, and this is used along with the music to great some very nice shifts between hard and soft in the same song. Just listen to \\"Back to School (Mini Maggit)\\", \\"Elite\\", \\"Teenager\\", and \\"Passenger\\" to get an idea of how many things they can do and still sound like the same hardcore band. The single \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" interested me when I first heard it years ago, although I never got around to really listening to them until now, and I'm not sure why. Every song is enjoyable, and they manage to avoid all sounding the same which happens to a lot of bands with a similar style. It's not astounding but it's good hard rock.
B000KJU182|5.0|This is a superb DVD, from Warner Brothers. The B&W 2:40-1 widescreen print is wonderful, rich blacks, nice midtones and so robust it looks like it was filmed yesterday...do not fear a thing from this transfer. <br /> <br />   When you have a book by Herman Melville and the production and direction in the hands of Peter Ustinov you have no worries about quality. This is one of histories great films. Ustinov appears as Captain Vere, along with a superb collection of English actors...and Melvyn Douglas, who was on holiday and talked into appearing as Danska. This comes out amusingly in DVD extra. <br /> <br />   The cast is superb, featuring, in his first role, Terence Stamp. He is the perfect choice of innocence to Robert Ryan's Claggart...talk about inspired casting! Wow!!!...everyone is one the same page and as if all this was not enough you get a wonderful voice over chat with Mr. Stamp and director / film buff Steven Soderbergh...which is fantastic! It doesn't go scene by scene but rather is a running commentary of life in the early 1960s and how films differed in this era, the power of the director etc. It's a very good commentary, excellent is more like it. <br /> <br />   Clearly Soderbergh and Stamp get on well, as witnessed by the under rated 1999 film The Limey, featuring both as director and star. <br /> <br />   A nearly perfect DVD of a nearly perfect film...a masterwork.
0340827246|4.0|I have been an avid fan of the Sopranos since day one and when I saw this cookbook on the bookshelf I went right for it. First off, I didn't' buy the book for the recipes, I bought it for the pictures and stories but once I started looking at the recipes I got intrigued. I made the manicotti and escarole with garlic recipes! Not only did they turn out delicious but they were pretty simple to make and follow. Now I try to pick one special recipe from this book and make it before the show comes on every Sunday.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|I want the original and the directors cut and won't settle for less. I saw the original in the theater more than once. No other movie besides \\"Star Wars\\" impressed me so much. This movie is in the top 5 of all time great SciFi movies. No other movie will do a better job of immersing you in a future world than Ridley Scott did here. Imagine how impressive it was in the theater over twenty-five years ago if it can do that even today. It is an astounding vision of the future. When it comes to robot movies I will take this over \\"I, Robot\\" any day. This movie showed how good of actors that Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer could be. Both have done alot since, but not necessarily better. This was probably Hauer's best film, but I do like \\"Ladyhawke\\" quite a bit. Ford, well he has several good ones, \\"The Fugitive\\" is hard to top and I enjoy him in \\"Star Wars\\", but this is still my favorite of all he has done. Any fan of SciFi must have this in their collection. This almost seems like a cop drama crossed with a SciFi movie. The sets, lighting, and camera work are amazing and will make you feel you are living in the future. This one is a keeper that you will want on DVD. I wish Ridley Scott would put Isaac Asimov's Foundation series into movies. If it was half as good as what he did with Blade Runner I'm sure it would be breath taking.

I was riding home with a friend so after she told me what it was I punched it in on my computer...since then I've been gaining more and more knowledge about the story untill I recently decided I wanted to go see it live in LA. Now onto what you wanna hear about, the music. Oh my god...The music is VERY powerful and moving ((especially in numbers like \\"Defying Gravity\\", \\"No Good Deed\\", and \\"For Good\\")) but it is also light and or comical ((Examples: \\"What Is This Feeling?\\", \\"One Short Day\\")). All in all I hail WICKED as a 5 out of 5, and I am anxious to see the production, hopefully sometime soon!!!
B000N6U0E2|4.0|If you're not a feel-good person, it's still okay to watch THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS. Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....<br /><br />Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.<br /><br />Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.<br /><br />The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.<br /><br />Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happyness.<br /><br />(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I've seen most of this series on BBC TV in the UK - it is absolutely stunning. It's a pity that the HD/Blu-Ray versions don't include the 'diaries' (10 to 15 minutes each) because many of these are very entertaining in their own right - some feature very dry and understated humour from the cameramen and other crew members. I do accept, though, that this may well be a minor consideration for people who intend to buy either of these versions.

B000OCXF0Q|1.0|I am very disappointed with the content of Avril's newest CD.  I attended a concert of hers summer 05, and MORE THAN HALF OF THAT AUDIENCE WAS  CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS!  I cannot believe she has stooped so low with the language used in just about every song!  What's up with that.  She is no longer any kind of a role model to the younger crowd.  It's no wonder kids have such profane language these days.  Kids who will be singing to her new songs will be getting more comfortable with the F word, as it is in at least 3 of her new songs.  I cannot believe that her mother and father are \\"proud of her,\\" nor her family's \\"Christian\\" family!  Shame on you, Avril!  For the most part, this CD is trash.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|i have been to airports and they do not play anything nearly this beautiful. as much as i love mr eno's \\"thursday afternoon,\\" and harold budd's \\"the white arcades,\\" this, \\"music for airports,\\" is my favorite ambient album of all-time. one of my favorite albums, period. roughly 47 minutes of bliss. nothing sounds ordinary here. it's all other-worldly, eerie and haunting. silence seems to be an ingredient floating within each note. \\"1/1\\" is my single favorite ambient track ever. sixteen and a half minutes of gorgeous tranquility. keyboard notes float around a simple, hypnotic melody. it really cannot be described. \\"2/1\\" has no instruments, a wordless angelic chorus drones on, making ear candy. the voices sound synthesized, from somewhere beyond our daily existence. \\"1/2\\" has those angelic voices back for an encore, this time drifting along while single keyboard notes drop perfectly in place, amongst the heavenly tide of gentle sound. \\"2/2\\" is a synthesizer piece that's pure peace. you have to experience this music, words can only hint at what is here. i've had this album around my house since around 1980. it has always felt good just knowing it's there.
B000G6BM00|5.0|James Cameron directed one of the most exciting and fascinating SF action adventure films ever made in Aliens. Not only does the story flow seamlessly from the first film of the series, Alien, but the characters, special effects and directorial pacing cause the film to pound like a sledge hammer from start to finish. The action is nearly non-stop once it begins and the character of Ripley as all protagonists should be, is driven further and further up that tree of absolute peril until you are just sure she'll be torn limb from limb. The grisly antagonists drive the action with such relentless power that the screen seems to come alive with their swarming malice. No surprise there though, since these monsters were dreamt up by Dan O'Bannon and Ron Shusett and brought to organic, ghastly life by the artist and sculptor H.R. Giger. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you've seen it already, see it again and tune into the finer cinematic touches that make the danger so palpable, especially the sound.
B000006Y60|4.0|I don't know where else they have this edition, but it is the one to get, if you don't want the CD/DVD edition of the record. I actually got mine at Best Buy, and for much cheaper than it's sold on Amazon. I usually kind of cringe when people assume the guys are \\"dance-pop,\\" but this album is one where I can accept the label, as it is happy and boppy most of the way through. The lyrics aren't meant to be emotional or deep as they have been on later records, and some of it is downright silly. <br /> <br />The hits \\"New Life\\" and \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" are classics, from a time when Vince Clarke (later in Yazoo and Erasure) was the main song-writer. The former has a kind of Kraftwerk feel, but the vocals don't sound like robots and it's kind of a different league. \\"JCGE\\" has been on many soundtracks and '80's compilations, and it's as infectious as the title would imply. There's two versions of the song. The original is the better one, but the Schizo Mix is fine too. (They both appear here.) Some of it is a guilty pleasure, like \\"Boys Say Go!\\" has no depth and is possibly kind of embarassing, but it's also catchy. Then some of it is so goofy you don't know to take it seriously. Vince Clarke may have been gay, and \\"What's Your Name?\\" could have possibly refered to it, but with the \\"P-R-E-double T Y\\" part, it just loses anything worth taking seriously. Some of them were kind of more standard style, like \\"Puppets,\\" but that one was alright, too. <br /> <br />It isn't perfect, as the instrumentals leave something to be desired, and \\"Tora! Tora! Tora\\" isn't quite as strong as later stuff Martin L. Gore would be known to write. But it's worth having for four tracks unavailable on the U.S. standard edition: The normal version of \\"JCGE,\\" \\"I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead\\" (originally on the UK record, but an exec was queasy of the inclusion), \\"Ice Machine,\\" and \\"Shout.\\" These make it a keeper and will have you repeating the record more. <br /> <br />It's a catchy, mindless, fun album. It won't appeal to everyone, especially the classic rock fan who hated synthesizers, and it is sort of cheesy, but that's kind of charming in my eyes. And the group sounds pretty young here, too. Yet, the members were the average age of about 19 during this release. Not as good as the likes of [[ASIN:B000002L75 Some Great Reward]] and later albums, but it's still fine enough. If you hate Depeche Mode for sounding too moody, this record will come as a pleasant surprise for you.

B00004RFCM|5.0|In 1998, just as the so-called \\"king\\" of all sitcoms was ending, Darren Star (creator of \\"[[ASIN:B000H7JCGE Melrose Place]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000H7JCG4 Beverly Hills, 90210]]\\") created his own - \\"Sex and the City,\\" very loosely based upon the book by reknowned columnist and socialite Candance Bushnell.  The series revolved around the misadventures of Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) and her group of self-obsessed girlfriends: successful lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), whose seemingly constant single status has led many to believe she's homosexual; naive Charlotte (Kristin Davis), whose life revolves around marriage; and Samantha (Kim Cattrall), who may have slept with every man in New York - on numerous occasions.  Together, these young, beautiful, and talented women struggle through the late-90s (and eventually early millennium) dating scene, wondering why they're single, what makes men tick, and just looking for love in the Big Apple.      The first season, which aired in 1998, includes 12 delightful episodes.  Within the first few enough personality types have been mentioned (such as \\"Modelizers,\\" those who are addicted to sleeping with models) and enough ridiculous events have occurred to make the series potentially as memorable and quotable as \\"[[ASIN:B00005JLEX Seinfeld]].\\"  The largest story of the first season revolves around Carrie's uncertain relationship with the mysterious Mr. Big (\\"[[ASIN:B00005JLFV Law & Order]]\\"'s Chris Noth).  Carrie knows she loves him, deeply and truly, but does he love her?    \\"Sex and the City\\" is one of those series that makes you thank your lucky stars for HBO.  The freedom that comes with running a show on HBO is incredible.  There is uncensored and restrainless nudity and foul language (which may put off the more timid viewer), an essential part of the show.  I imagine that without this, the show wouldn't have been anywhere near as popular or even as good, and on any normal station would probably have flopped.  (To see what I mean, watch the HBO version of one episode, and then watch that same episode during the edited TBS re-runs.)      Not that the show's all about getting naked and cursing.  There's much more here, particularly a stellar cast.  Parker is a heroine for the 90s, and the other girls are normal enough for us to sympathize, but also more than funny enough to keep us entertained.  Noth is unquestionably the male highlight, a tall, dark, and devilishly handsome man whose mysterious nature just adds to his charm.  The cast is supported by writing that's thoughtful, witty, and creative.  Unlike Meredith Grey's episodic musings on \\"[[ASIN:B00005JO9J Grey's Anatomy]],\\" Carrie Bradshaw's are truly meaningful, and I'm sure legions of women can identify with the problems faced by Carrie and her gang.    All in all, the first season of \\"Sex and the City,\\" though short (each episode runs a mere 23 minutes on average), is a blast.  The characters are down-to-earth and very human, the cast is brilliant, and if the show's attitude toward men is a little chauvinistic, the exemplary writing more than makes up for it.  It's romantic, it's fun, it's clever - \\"Sex and the City\\" is an irresistible piece of TV candy that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to try a new flavor.    NOTE: If you are at all familiar with the show, or even have a hunch that you'll like it, I'd recommend you shell out the money to purchase the [[ASIN:B000ASDFJU complete series set]], a gorgeous package and a MAJOR improvement over the pitiful single-season releases.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|In 1927 my mother was 17 years old. Like most of the country at that time she would have been living a largely agrarian lifestyle, a countrified life, filled with cornpone and over-cooked green beans. Her simple cotton clothes would have smelled of some borax-like detergent and her nails would have been short and split from hard work around the farm. Had she made it to town to see this picture show on some muggy Saturday night in 1927 with my father, she would have stared agog at the screen as the phantasmagoric images swam past in futuristic splendor. For a brief hour and a half or so it would have lifted her away from the washboards and wringers and pump handles and udders and brooms and clotheslines. When she came out she would have shaken her head in disbelief and laughed with wonder that such a world could have been created. Imagine yourself in 1927 when you see this film and share the wonder of this, one of the very first films in (and the likely fertile progenitor of) the cinematic genre called science fiction. Its cost, they say, was over $200 million in adjusted dollars - quite an extravagance for the time, two-thirds the cost of Titanic.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|With series like the blue planet and life on earth David Attenborough and the BBC were always pushing boundaries and striving to capture the attention of the audience. The problem is that many of the new adience now watching T.V are used to the 'blink and you'll miss it' fast editing style of both television and film today. With this in mind 'Planet Earth' moves at a far quicker pace than any comparable documentary before it. First impressions are that the BBC have 'dumbed down' but at closer inspection this series has as much to offer as any before it with a wealth of fascinating information. But lets be honest, we want some stunning pictures to watch and thats where this series scores again and again. dolphins 'surfing' a beach for lunch, a sandstorm of biblical proportions sweeping across a desert, caves of stunning beauty and size along with the odd little creatures that live within them and a thousand other amazing creatures and places that we are shown, have explained and then are whisked off to the next location/ creature to marvel at. In truth it's something of a visual theme park ride but thats no bad thing because at no point is the quality diminished, its just that no section is allowed to outstay its welcome. <br />For me though the crowning glory is that the BBC have at last caught up with technology and produced this in hi-def. Now I know thats old hat for you lot but over here we have not long caught on to Hi-def, and how the picture here shines, if you have the telly for it then this will blow your socks off as the picture is outstanding. <br />Sound is respectable but a little subdued on the whole. The extras vary according to which version you buy but are really one or two extra documentaries,( I guess bloopers and gag reels aren't appropriate here!),. <br />This is a major leap forward for what could easily become a bit of a stale genre. If you have already seen it then you have probably  pre-ordered your copy,(if only to hear it without Ms. Weaver reading from a script!), but if you have not seen this then believe me you will love it. Buy with confidence, this is what documentaries should all look like from now on.
B000O178BY|5.0|One of the marks of great artists in popular music tends to be the ability to reinvent themselves over and over, while still keeping a sense of idenity.  Year Zero may be a textbook example of that.  With a still developing sonic aesthetic, Mr. Renzor moves into material that is no longer simply emotional issues, much to the worry of some critics who felt that produced his best work.  Alot of critics also seemed to worry that songs would not be relateable to those not immursed in the year zero storyline that had preceded it in the marketing campaign.  However, what the result of Renzor's has been is a work that should be a great gem in the hall of NIN classics.<br /><br />Sonicly, you can hear alot of interesting influences coming into play, it would feel like some of the bands he's toured with such as TV on the Radio, Bauhaus, and Saul Williams(who appears on the record) seem to have influenced the record sonicly.  Personally I heard moments that made me think of artists ranging from Wolf Eyes to Anti-pop Consortium to the Knife.  I say all of this as a compliment to the work.  In terms of NIN albums, Year Zero seems to capture the good parts of the Downward Spirals mechanical strength, the imaginative atomsphere and expermentalism of the Fragile, with none of the weakness or insecurity that seemed to plague With Teeth.  The album is blessedly free of to many \\"metal\\" moments, and the electonic presence is heavy.  The guitars are either fuzzed out or electonicly tinged or both most of the time, while many songs are draged through the nicest parts of drum machine and synthesizer hell.<br /><br />Perhaps a album that might be a little less to the commercial side of the NIN coin, true fans should find this disc to playing in their stereo's for quite awhile.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Fear Of A Blank Planet is, simply put, a perfect conclusion what Steven Wilson has strived to achieve with each record of this space-metal-era Porcupine Tree.  Not saying that I would mind him pushing his musical boundraries even further, but I can't think of anyway he could.  The album is cohesive, creative, effortlessly beautiful.   <br /> <br />The album has everything that one would expect from PT, but the concept is strong and so is the songwriting - through the entire album.  The first album I bought by Porcupine Tree was In Absentia.  So while I respect Wilson's prior phases, I hold the sound of Porcupine Tree of In Absentia through the new album closer to my heart.  In Absentia was one of my favorite albums, but as the years passed by, I noticed that some of the songs flat-out blew some of the weaker ones out of the water(IMO), making an innconsistant listen.  Then Deadwing came, which was still good, but left something to be desired (lyrics like \\"okay whats next, after the sex\\" I can do without.)  Fear Of A Blank Planet has no bad songs.  Okay, there are only six, but maybe when Wilson focuses on a few songs instead of many, he gets really into it.  Also the lyrics are mostly tasteful and personal.   <br /> <br />As always, the music is the stongest aspect of Porcupine Tree.  The melodies here are absoluetly chilling. The heavy guitars are heavier than they have ever been, while maintaining a \\"comfortably numb\\" vibe, an accomplishmentI have a profound respect for.  The heavy guitars do remind me (again) of Opeth, but this time they don't sound like they were ripped from an Opeth song.  They sound like something Porcupine Tree would write.  It's hard to explain, but I think you'll see what I mean.  In fact, just listen to Anesthetize and try to deny the fact that it is both the heaviest and (one of ) the best Porupine Tree has ever recorded!  Also, Wilson writes vocal harmonies that would make Brian Wilson blush. Really awesome stuff. <br /> <br />This is probably the best space-metal album since Cave In's masterpiece, Jupiter.  And the most fun I've had listening to a Porcupine Tree album...ever.  This is one for the ages.
1400032717|5.0|A very enjoyable book, hard to put down.  Haddon's ability to have the reader develop understanding and compassion for the characters is wonderful.
B00008OE34|5.0|In 1927 my mother was 17 years old. Like most of the country at that time she would have been living a largely agrarian lifestyle, a countrified life, filled with cornpone and over-cooked green beans. Her simple cotton clothes would have smelled of some borax-like detergent and her nails would have been short and split from hard work around the farm. Had she made it to town to see this picture show on some muggy Saturday night in 1927 with my father, she would have stared agog at the screen as the phantasmagoric images swam past in futuristic splendor. For a brief hour and a half or so it would have lifted her away from the washboards and wringers and pump handles and udders and brooms and clotheslines. When she came out she would have shaken her head in disbelief and laughed with wonder that such a world could have been created. Imagine yourself in 1927 when you see this film and share the wonder of this, one of the very first films in (and the likely fertile progenitor of) the cinematic genre called science fiction. Its cost, they say, was over $200 millions in adjusted dollars - quite an extravagance for the time, two-thirds the cost of Titanic.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This one is like a BBC special on steroids.  It combines all the best qualities of BBC adaptations of English classics with a \\"big film\\" feel and superb cast.  I'd watch it several times.
1582701709|1.0|I'll start by admitting that I'm always skeptical of any self-help books: they tend to be a lot of packaging wrapped around a few nuggets of (common sense) wisdom.  This book, on the other hand, is a load of repetitive, self-indulgent, hyperbolic cr*p wrapped around the tiniest kernel of an idea.   <br /> <br />Want to know the secret without wasting your money?  Positive thinking attracts positive results.  There, secret is out.  Feel better?  I don't.  If you still feel the need to spend money, go donate your money to save people in Darfur.  That is good. <br /> <br />I could go on for a long time about everything I found objectionable about the book - the author's apparent use of a big, thick thesaurus to dredge every last synonym for positive outcomes (\\"illuminated\\"???) to her endless references to becoming wealthy (is this the only positive to which we should strive?).   <br /> <br />For year, people have taken advantage of the human tendency to seek a quick fix to just about everything, including the desire to become wealthy, happy or successful in anything.  I can't fault her for playing to the masses.  Nevertheless, this book panders horribly to our instincts of greed and avarice cloaked in a supposedly spiritual, metaphysical message.  It was insulting to a person who is not even very religious. <br /> <br />Moreover, I'm still puzzled by the references therein- quotes by supposed \\"authors, filmmakers and scientists\\" I've apparently never heard of.  One  goes so far to state that the \\"law of attaction\\", the premise of the book, works like magnetism - \\"like attracts like\\".  In the interest of full disclosure, my two years as a biology major followed by two as an English major probably didn't adequately prepare me for a discussion on physics, but last time I checked, like repelled like.  If you are going to make an analogy, make it work at least. <br /> <br />The book was a gift, so I didn't feel taken.  However, I feel that the author owes me a couple hoursof my life back.  Can I apply for a refund?
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|\\"Blow Up\\" (1966) by Michelangelo Antonioni - is an artful, extremely well made meditation on the manipulation of images. The theme that first Antonioni's English-language film examines is reality vs. perception. We know that seeing is believing but can we always trust ourselves with what we see? Can we explain what we see? The film is as multi-layered as it is puzzling. It is very easy to admire this film and it is difficult to love it - it stimulates the mind but it does not do much for the feelings. The characters appear and disappear mysteriously, sometimes, literally in the thin air - after a while you don't care much what happens to them.<br /><br />Antonioni was able to do what his hero could not - he captured the moment in time. His evidence of the most happening place in the world of the 1960s, the \\"Swinging London\\" with its cool music, a lot of beautiful girls exquisite like rare exotic flowers, parties, night clubs, Yardbirds performance, David Hemming in his white jeans looking like blond Paul McCartney, will not be destroyed and won't disappear like the pictures of the possible murder in the film did.
B00000ILDE|5.0|James Cameron directed one of the most exciting and fascinating SF action adventure films ever made in Aliens. Not only does the story flow seamlessly from the first film of the series, Alien, but the characters, special effects and directorial pacing cause the film to pound like a sledge hammer from start to finish. The action is nearly non-stop once it begins and the character of Ripley as all protagonists should be, is driven further and further up that tree of absolute peril until you are just sure she'll be torn limb from limb. The grisly antagonists drive the action with such relentless power that the screen seems to come alive with their swarming malice. No surprise there though, since these monsters were dreamt up by Dan O'Bannon and Ron Shusett and brought to organic, ghastly life by the artist and sculptor H.R. Giger. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you've seen it already, see it again and tune into the finer cinematic touches that make the danger so palpable, especially the sound.

B000O178BY|3.0|While I still think Trent Reznor is a musical genius, this is clearly his worst album to date. \\"Capital G\\" is the worst song he has ever put out. The music is highly conceptual and would be great if there were no lyrics with it. I mentioned in my review of With Teeth that his lyrics were becoming pretty cheesy and it's still evident here. With the line \\"come on everybody sing along\\" it makes he think he really didn't put much effort into the lyrics at all. I even think he should consider working with someone else on his lyrics as alot of the same words and phrases keep appearing through all his albums. There is also a song towards the end of the cd where he screams and it sounds VERY theatrical. Come on Trent, let's leave that type of sound to Queen as they did it best.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is one of the best of this genre, literary adaptations.  Highly recommended, great cast especially Amada Root.
1582701709|1.0|This book is nothing new, it is just the same old new age, metaphysical garbage that has been espoused for years. Basically, the idea is there are waves in the univers that you can latch onto. If you want wealth, latch onto the wealth waves; if you want to be skinny, latch onto the skinny waves, etc. It is \\"name it claim it; gab it grab it; prosperity gospel\\" without God.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Going back and looking at the three older movies, it is fun to see how skillfully Lucas wraps up Anakin's/Darth Vader's story BUT what about the key figure in the newer trilogy?  What about Jar Jar Binks?  He is totally absent from Epsiode IV-VI.  It seems to me that a THIRD trilogy is needed to wrap up this remarkable and fascinating character's story.
B00004Y6NP|3.0|Great pop album, with lots of well known songs. <br />To me, the best one is the title track, really good emotional song.
B00006ZXSK|1.0|I must say, I love this movie. The story is nice and sweet. The acting wasn't bad either. So the 1 star is not for the movie but for the DVD itself. I was so happy because I thought I got a good deal for getting this DVD for $9.99 but when I got it, the disc did not have any kind of print on the front side whatsoever like most DVD movies have. The only indication of which side goes which is a very small strip of red in the center which has the title and label in all-caps \\"reverse side\\".    And, the only special features it has is the movie trailer. So, anyone who's looking for cast/director commentaries, deleted scenes and other behind-the-scenes features, you'll not get it on this DVD.    Edit: I'm so sorry for my ignorance. Thanks for pointing out that you can play this DVD on both sides. However, I'm still quite disappointed that the DVD did not have any special features other than the Movie Trailer. I'd hope there would be more extra features on the reverse side but I guess there wasn't. It'd be great if Amazon included the list of special features so I would know exactly what's on the DVD.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|I love Avril's earlier work. I was hoping for something more mature and complex. I know she has it in her. This is what happens when the bean counters take control of artistic developement.
B000059XUI|5.0|The followup to \\"Superman: The Movie\\" keeps the fast paced action moving along as Jor-L struggles with his feelings for Lois Lane while three Kryptonian supervillains ravage the planet Earth only to meet up with none other than Lex Luthor: the greatest criminal mind of all time. I personally haven't read all the trivia about Richard Donner vs. Richard Lester, special Donner editions, Hollywood politics, etc. All I can tell you is that \\"Superman: The Movie\\" and \\"Superman II\\" are both awesome, they seem like they should be part of one larger movie but can easily pass as a babysitting double feature, and wow they are fun!! I need to check out the more deluxe packages (maybe even BUY them!) because these 2000/1 editions that I checked out from the library could use a little more in the special features department. I wanted to review them anyway, though . . . because they're SOOO GOOOOOD!!!
038572179X|5.0|Turning over the final page, I reflected on what I just read, and realized that I was glad that there are still writers with extraordinary writing style these days.  It has been hard to come across great writers in our day, what with all the different styles that stubborn writers claim are revolutionary, but in reality they're just plain crap--with good marketing resources, so they end up selling nonetheless.<br /><br />But Atonement is no such crap, and Ian McEwan is no such crappy author.  From his unbelievably detailed accounts of war, hospital life, and a classic love scene, McEwan's style of writing not only pulls you immediately into the novel, but gives you a clear description of what's going on.  He paints for you a picture with words that you can see through  the pages of a book.  A classic story published in this millenium--practically unheard of before.
0385333846|5.0|Is this book a classic? Undoubtedly. It shines, cuts and weaves its way through a wonderfully intriguing plot. Vonnegut's use of imagery is superb, his economical way with words unparelled; he richly deserved all his accolades.    The only positive to come out of Kurt's passing is the renewed interest in his work. Hopefully this will inspire other authors to dare reach for the greatness that was Vonnegut.     But is this Vonnegut's best work? No. If you're only checking out Vonnegut because he was recently in the news, because he died, I'd buy \\"Cat's Cradle\\" instead. That's Kurt's best work.     Now I still feel Slaughterhouse Five was one of the 20 best books ever written. I'd rank it around number 18; Cat's Cradle would be in the top three. [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]]
0446677450|5.0|A great book for beginners in the financial world. And what is a beginner? Someone who has credit card debt, a person who cannot retire until they are in their 60's, folks who do not know the definition of delayed gratification, and generally most Americans who have an \\"if it feels good buy it\\" mentality. Kiyosaki breaks down the mental state of typical people and shakes you until you wake up and realize that having money is important and spending money gets you less money. The fundamentals are that creating money instead of working for money is most important and buying stuff only gets you more stuff. The point of this book is to instruct you on how to reach financial independence - the point where you can live off passive income without working - and Kiyosaki gives step by step instructions.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I've watched all 11 episodes through BBC. Believe it or not, It's the best documentary I've ever watched.(maybe also the best in the next few decades!) Truly amazing from every aspect, from the gorgeous shots taken from over 200 locations on our planet to the spectacular Narration from David Attenborough! <br />I highly recommended the standard DVD version because of its supplementary materials which is somehow not included in the Blu-ray or HDDVD version. <br />You may wonder is there any differences compared to the other many many documentaries focused on our earth, I can guarantee it is full of innovation humanity and surprise and it will not let you down.
B000002G7E|5.0|The VU is a hipster dream band. Now it has become fashionable to simply adore the Velvet Underground, especially the debut (yeah the one with the banana). I do not doubt how important the VU's debut was but now I rarely seem to listen to it. It seems the VU has become a name-dropping device for pseudo-artsy hipster kiddies while sporting his/her new Warhol made-in-China banana peel shoulder bag. However, true lovers of the VU will always turn to the still little-known soundscape. This album- White Light/White Heat- distilled the VU to its pure core (aka without the annoying Warhol and odd Nico) with John Cale and Lou Reed.  <br /> <br />There will always be a fight over which member of the VU was the most important but this noise masterpiece seemed to be guided by the genius of John Cale with his avant-garde inclinations and willingness to challenge the listener's perception of music. Cale would later make far more tuneful, pretty, and (better?) recordings such as his stunning Paris 1919 album but this is the one and only White Light/ White Heat. <br /> <br />As for Lou Reed, well, he is being plain ole Lou Reed. He plays a nasty guitar on \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\". The best VU album that displays his  folky pop talents would be the album after White Light/White Heat- the self titled album.   <br /> <br />If you like this album get Wire's Chairs Missing, Sonic Youth's EVOL, My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, PiL's Metal Box, and (if you want to go all the way with this noisy stuff...) Fripp and Eno's No Pussyfooting.   <br /> <br />This album will scare all the poseurs away. <br />
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I need some help with this.  I currently do not have an HDTV. Which DVD should I buy?  Should I buy the HD-DVD so in the future when I have an HDTV it will be a better picture, but will that play okay on a non HDTV??? <br />Or just buy a regular DVD.  This is an amazing series!!!
B000NA1OXY|2.0|It is common place in music, for an artist to release a successful first album, then a more serious or experimental second album, and then after that flops, go back to basics.  Avirl just fell into this category.  What this ruffly translates to is that the second album was not the same success as the first, so she wanted to get back to what she did right the first time.  The trouble is, she is a much more talented artist that this album, and we know it.  While some will welcome the return to the bratty girl sound of Let Go, I'm disapointed.  She showed on her second album some really good material and the change to really shine among the ton of girl bots out there.  But instead she chickened out when the sales weren't quite up to par on her second album, and went \\"back to basics.\\"  While I like some songs on the album, overall it feels like a step back
0670033375|5.0|Diamond makes no predictions as to what our world will look like in the future because he, like everyone else, has no idea what the future will bring. What he does do remarkably well, however, is look at various societies in the past and show how their lifestyle led to geographic and environmental declines that ultimately led to the end of the society. The chapters can be long and detailed, but are well researched and presented effectively. I took his thesis to be that we today are essentially no different from those that have lived on this earth before us regardless of our superior technology, and that the problems that led to the destruction of former societies may eventually in some form destroy us, but on a much grander scale, given that the world is so much more interconnected now than at any time in the history of the world.<br /><br />The most useful part of the book, I thought, was how Diamond shows that the environment, exhaustion of natural resources and increased population have caused some of the greatest problems of our time, most notably the Rwandan genocide of the last decade, among others. And for anyone that doesn't believe in global warming or the pending environmental problems we will have to face in our lifetime, please read the chapter on China. This book is a compelling argument for the environmental and global problems that need to be addressed by our world leaders. I applaud Diamond for his thorough research and attention to these timely issues.
B00005B36H|5.0|I first heard this album the year it came out. Now, almost 6 years later it is stil my all-time favorite album. Each song is unique and geniously placed so that there is remarkable flow throughout the entire album. I am a huge Tool fan, who (until this album came out) thought that the songs H. or Jimmy could never be outdone. The Lateralus album proved this completely wrong when I heard the title track \\"Lateralus\\" which blows anything I have ever heard  in the rock scene out of the water. Although 10,000 Days and the past Tool albums are all incredible and unique, Lateralus is the cream of the crop, distinguishing a new genre and raising the bar for the new century.  <br /> <br />It is also important to realize that it is nearly impossible to compare Tool albums to one another, because they all portray different times in the band member's lives. It's important to remember that when Opiate was first written, Maynard was at a totally different place in his life. The albums are a decade apart, and it shows growth that the music has changed so much. We should be happy that such growth and progression has occurred, and not the same album is being produced over and over again. It is worth listening to if just to track the progress and the evolution of one of the most influential bands of our age.
B000O178BY|3.0|This album is a step in the right direction with Reznor's use of of more electronic sounds. I believe that the melodies and Vocals continue to get worse every album. He needs to find good outside producers to help him out with  these boring melodies and lyrics. His strong structure and musicality continue to be cutting edge, but that is not enough to cover up for the poor vocals. It might have been better if he would have just skipped vocals completely this album. <br /> <br />This is at least a step in the right direction, but I do not think he will ever make music again that was a complete package as phm or tds. The fragile was Reznors peak, but he is still worth listing to to see what new production tweaks he comes up with.  <br /> <br />Granted he is older now and the rage and heaviness associated with broken and tds would not fit now, but neither does his new vocal stylings. <br /> <br />All in all fans will like it, but longtime fans will know that NIN is not what it used to be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
034544678X|5.0|I've read this book twice -- each time after adopting a terrier from the local animal shelter.  I can't recommend it too highly in understanding why we primates have such a hard time in understanding our canine companions.  It's an invaluable training tool.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I managed to grab a pair of these cans during the closing of a department at work. They've seen a lot of use (try over two years, daily in a professional environment) and they still work perfectly. I don't know what some other people are doing to have connector problems because the one on the old pair is perfect.<br /><br />I've listened to a lot of headphones and these are the best I've ran into that have everything I want. The sound is absolutely beautiful, they fit over my ears and they are comfortable. A lot of the others can do two of the three but this is the first one to pull off the trifecta. So now I've bought a pair for use at my home. I was prepared to spend a lot more money to get a pair of headphones that suited me but the Sony MDR-7506s have it all over their competitors.
B000LC55F2|5.0|There were many surprises at this year's Academy Awards.  One of the biggest was the absence of nominations for several films, most noticeably this one.  Containing no sex, no nudity, no bad language, no gore, no grand action scenes, minimal comedy, a non-descript sountrack, and only several seconds of violence, this movie has none of the hallmarks of a top movie.  But a top movie it is; it sat atop the box office charts for a month and everyone who has seen it comes away impressed.  This is one of those movies that stands out for its inventiveness, its innovative mode of storytelling, its twists and turns at many points of the plot, and ability to make the viewer empathize with all the main characters.  Great movies have themes, and this movie has multiple.  First is obsession, not necessarily of revenge, but also of winning, of being the best, and of having what others have and more.  Second is rivalry.  Many movies have tried to show how a friendship evolves into a deadly rivalry.  Examples include Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Gods and Generals and Cleopatra.  None of these does the job as good as this movie.  Neither character, Alfred or Angiers, is good, and neither are bad.  Both are professionals trying to reach the top of their professions, and if this means backstabbing each other, so be it.  Third is sacrifice; everyone sacrifices more than necessary to achieve their ends, and the result all around is lost loves and lost lives.    The most impressive aspect of this movie is its mode of storytelling.  In the early 1990's, Pulp Fiction came out and introduced the circular method of showing a movie.  Then came the Sixth Sense in the late 1990's and the method of a flashback at the end that redefined the entire movie from the get-go.  Then there are the Star Wars movies; sequels first then the prequels later.  Now we have the Prestige; three different storylines spliced together to create a play on time.      The movie was great, and the DVD was good.  No extra or deleted scenes, just the interviews, explanations of special effects, and poster art.  Overall, a great watching experience
B000MGUZM0|5.0|If you love funeral, you must buy this album.  The best way to listen to this album is while your driving.  It has all of the charm of a good springsteen tune with a hint of pixies, echo & the bunnymen, the cure, david burn, radio head, the list goes on and on.  I would not say that this album is like any one of these bands in particular but you can sense their presence. <br /> <br />Buy it, drop it in your ipod & <br />F-ing rock!!
B00004VXF2|3.0|I suppose how you feel about this album depends on how you feel about Lou Reed.  And I, for one, think that his muse died with the seminal Velvet Underground.  How could anyone place his solo work in the same league with Bob Dylan's or Neil Young's?  Many consider Lou's master opus to be TRANSFORMER, a mediocre and dated display of Lou Reed imitating David Bowie imitating Lou Reed.  \\"You hit me with a flower\\"?!  \\"You do it every hour\\"?!  Just which of his solo albums is the joke, people?  I would argue that ALL of them are, but MMM is at least more interesting than most.  For one thing, Lou's mumbling Noo Yawk squauk is nowhere to be found, which is good news for me.  Another plus is the complete absence of his overrated \\"guitar work.\\"  Here, the guitars do the work themselves.  This is Lou saying, \\"I am completely unnecessary,\\" which makes it the most honest statement of his career and the only solo album he should have ever made.  I don't care if it's noise or art, ahead of its time or avant-vomit.  Somehow it manages to be both bloated rock star-pretentious and punk at the same time.  Insane asylums deserve their own elevator music, and nothing fits the bill better than these four sides of ear-bleeding madness.  Enjoy.

The website calls it \\"powerful affirmations.\\"  I call it \\"Quit-whining-and-Just-do-the-darn-thing!\\"   <br /> <br />For A Bible-walking Christian this book can be offensive and contradictory to Biblical principles.  Although it has biblical references to \\"ask, seek, and believe\\" and \\"bible millionaires.\\"  it can be construed as a \\"fox in a hen house\\"  or \\"a fox in sheep's clothing\\".  Why?  Throughout the book, the authors talk about how the power is in your hands through the universe.  Not God.    It's how you will it and the universe just re-aligns itself to your wishes.  Not crediting God.  So really the book makes it look like it's all safe.  After all, it is sprinkled with Biblical words.   A bad idea wrapped in a beautiful wrapper. <br /> <br /> Like I said I am knowledgeable enough about the Bible to say that it contradicts the fact that one must be self-less.  That one must decrease and God increase. Not selfish.  A young person  without knowing that biblical principle would be encouraged to wish whatever without regard to whether it is God's will for his/her life; whether that wish would hurt others or loved ones; or whether it is realistic or unselfish.    One would be betteroff reading \\"The Purpose-Driven Life.\\"   <br />Furthermore,  it didn't mention anything about what is one's purpose in life really is.    <br />It CAN be extremely deceiving to a Christian with no strong Biblical background.    <br /> <br />The best way to take this book is just be careful.   Take the practical stuff and leave out the rest.   Just think positively, look at life half-full instead of half-empty.  Work hard and don't get too carried away by The Secret's dogma.   In the end, it can be your loved ones that may get hurt by your selfish wishes.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|We really like this movie.  It is very depressing as this type of life style would be difficult.  Matt Damon is an outstanding actor.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|The year is 2027 and every human is infertile.  <-- From the onset, you can see why this movie was so terrible; the plot was almost laughable.  That aside, I was hoping at least some other aspect of the movie would blow me completely away!   Let's see if that happened:    Plot:  A movie that tried to be too hard to be powerful that it was just completely ridiculous.    Characters:  A waste of Clive Owen and Michael Cane's talent.  Their performances were uninspired and boring.  Juliane moore was in it for 5 seconds before she got killed - OOPS!  I just saved your time, don't worry.  No eye candy either (subconciously, having attractive characters actually makes a difference - don't believe me? just think about it).    Suspense:  None.  The plot is basic - implausible - but basic.  Action:  Some, but nothing we've never seen before.    Ending:  Cliched like no other ending.   Cinematography:  Shaky, low budget film.    Tone:  It was supposed to make you feel depressed and emotional, but it was more of an ugly and bored feeling.  Overall thought during the movie:  What the heck is going on???  DVD Quality:  Poor- I could not hear what they were saying.  The explosions were really loud though.     Think of everything that you DONT like in a movie, and that's pretty much \\"Children of Men.\\"  I'm not an unemotional guy (read my other movie reviews).  I watched it with my housemates, and they all thought it was really bad too.   This movie just really blew!  Those were 1 hour and 50 minutes I'll never get back...
B000NVTHR8|4.0|I downloaded this cd early of off bittorrent. I was very excited when I saw that my favorite band After Forever was coming out with a new cd. I've been a dedicated fan ever since Exordium was released. This new cd has a different feel then the cds that came before. After Forever started out as a pure gothic metal band with some strange influences that felt middle eastern. Then Invisible Circles was released and the band got a more mainstream feel, and Floor Jansen's voice became main stage when her brother Mark Jansen left the band. When Remagine was realised they got a new synth artist which gave the band an even more mainstream goth metal feel. Remagine was the high point of After Forever's career. Floor was at her best with the guitars standing up perfectly behind her. This new cd, self-titled After Forever, strays away from the main staged Floor. They show a different side to their music which is more based on the sound behind the lyrics. The cd is still absolutely amazing, and Floor's voice is still there, just not as open. I listened to this band for the sole point of Floor's incredible voice, and now that it feels like their straying away from that beauty I'm not sure what to think. That's my opinion on this cd and it is still worth buying if your an After Forever fan. Good luck with it and I hope you all love this new masterpiece.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a great film with a great message and no matter how you look at it , we really need those kind of films again. This film is a marvel; a gem; a diamond in the rough! It expresses the true heart of American film making.
B0002MG9SI|3.0|Last things first, this DVD had its subtitles prepared by a \\"closed-captioning\\" institute - you know, for the hearing-impaired? If the hearing-impaired could hear the discrepancy between the spoken French and the English subtitles, they would scream. And since there is ALOT of dialogue and narration in this film, there is ALOT of subtitling.    Otherwise the film is harmless (perhaps too harmless) fun. Poor Audrey Tautou was compared (only because she had the same prenom) to Audrey Hepburn. While not equalling her in looks, Mlle Tautou is at least a better actress. The sepia-stained cinematography of Paris is, however, glorious. And the film has something conspicuously lacking lately - genuine charm (in moments).    Overall, my advice is to learn French and turn OFF the subtitles. Since the star-rating system limits me to choosing between \\"I Liked it\\" or \\"I Liked It Alot\\", I went for the former. I DID like it!
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is just one of those rare type of movies that come across every so often that really captures true human emotion without all the attention being focused on how many times something blows up or someone uttering a ridiculous line that forever huants the rest of that films celuloid life. This film is truly a work of art and will forever be one of my favorites.
B00005JPMX|4.0|Three thousand years ago, and series of stars aligned, made one man immortal, turned his army to stone and sent thirteen monsters from another dimension out into the world. In the present day, the pieces of this old story, the immortal man, the stone army and the 13 beasts, are coming together in present day New York. It's up to the Ninja Turtles to stop them, if only they could reunite. Things have been a little rocky for the four brothers lately, especially since their leader, Leonardo left the country. Two of them have had to take part time jobs, which is difficult if you're a mutant turtle, and while crime goes on a mysterious armoured figure is doing some crime fighting on his own... <br /> <br />I'm not quite sure what to make of this new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie. I used to be a big fan of the series as a kid, and I thought this film was pretty entertaining, but there seemed to be something missing from this one, and I'm not quite sure what it was. Just seemed a little less than it could have been, a little disconnected from the other films/comics/etc. Felt a bit more like a special than a full blown movie. Still, it's worth a look if you're interested. Three and a half stars.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have watched all of the Bond movies and this one, to me, is the best!
B000929AJQ|4.0|You know what?  I'm sick and tired of reading people saying that there is nothing \\"great\\" about With Teeth or even their new album Year Zero.  I'm tired of reading that With Teeth isn't a Master piece of an album.  First of all, With Teeth is the new sound NIN and quite frankly, it f*cking rocks.  IF you don't like it, that's awesome.  Go back to listening to pop-rock.  It's clearly your choice.  You must understand that Trent is no longer constantly abusing drugs and alcohol.  So, NO, he isn't going to be making the kind of music you heard on 1994's The Downward Spiral.  Ya that album was groundbreaking, but Trent was also a hudge Heroin attack at the time.  Look at how deep and dark The Fragile was.  Trent isn't like that anymore.  And GOOD FOR HIM.  Serriously.  That really rocks that he climbed up out of that hole he was in and he still is able to rock the f*cking house and do it hard.  If you are truly a NIN fan, you will like ANYTHING Trent puts out there because his music is constantly changing.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Although perhaps it's unfair to label this film as simply \\"family\\" entertainment.  P.J. Hogan's witty, magical version of J.M. Barrie's classic is a superb, mesmerizing piece of fantasy filmmaking that both parents and children will find infinitely rewarding.  Hogan and co-screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have taken some liberties with Barrie, but, incredibly, they enhance the original in ways that resonate in moving and heartbreaking ways.  (Goldenberg is the screenwriter for the upcoming \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" which is very good news for fans of that franchise.)  The casting is uniformly perfect, starting with Jeremy Sumpter's Peter, whose expressive grin and eyebrows bring the character to vibrant, mischieveous life.  How right that he's the only American in the cast, emphasizing Peter's exotic other-ness.  Rachel Hurd-Wood couldn't be lovelier as Wendy, and Jason Issacs is nothing short of brilliant, showing his full range as an actor, in the twin roles of Mr. Darling & Captain Hook.  And I love how Hogan and his art director, Roger Ford, have chosen to make their universe look unabashadly fantastical (as opposed to a Peter Jackson, who strives to make the fantastical look 100% real).  If I have one bone to pick, I would say that Ludivine Sagnier's Tinkerbell is a little too comically cutesy for my taste, but it's a minor quibble.  This is one of my favorite films of the past ten years, one that I pull out when I want to feel good.  And at the risk of commiting sacrilege, as \\"Peter Pan\\"s go, I actually prefer this to the Disney version!
0751532711|1.0|I fell for the hype and purchased the book. This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. It was poorly written as well. Do some Google searches on the author. He gets no respect from credible sources.
055357342X|5.0|The Kingdom of Westeros is still being torn apart by Civil unrest. The fighting between many key players has torn the world into 5 distinct factions. Joffrey is being supported by the house of the Lannisters owing to his Mother, Cersei, and natural fathers, Jaime. Stannis Baratheon has succumbed to the influence of the Red Priestess, Melisandre, who is still maintaining that he is the reborn messiah, Ashai. Robb Stark fights for the North, while Balon Greyjoy fights for the Iron Islands. Renly Baratheon, who was the fifth player in the story, has been killed by magic in the previous book.<br /><br />But there are many other parts to be played in this grandiose story of intrigue. Brienne of Tarth is escorting Jaime Lannister to King's Landing on Catelyn Stark's orders in the hopes that it will encourage the Lannisters to free her captive daughters, Arya and Sansa.  Robb Stark meets with Catelyn to question her of her releasing Jaime and she discovers that he has forgone his promise to the House of Frey to wed with one of their own in favor for a woman named Jeyne whom he fell in love with. Arya has been taken in by a group of mercenaries who want to ransom her to the highest bidder. Bran Stark is busy trying to get to the wall with Jojen and Meera Reed. Sansa bides her time in King's landing where she becomes a major pawn by virtue of her having reached marital age. Jon Snow is posing as a turncoat of the night watch by infiltrating the wildlings under Mance  Rayder where he has also taken to a girl named Ygritte, and Samwell also has a part to play in the north. Davos Seaworth continues to watch Stannis and Melisandre, constantly suspect of her motives. Tyrion Lannister maintains a watchers position in King's Landing and even becomes involved with his sister's and father's nefarious scheming. During all of this Daenerys  Targaryen is doing her utmost to secure an army fierce enough to throw into the fray.<br /><br />Once again the narrative is divergent in that it is told from the point of view of many different narrators. Catelyn, Jon Snow, Daenerys, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, and Davos return to convey their stories. Added to this are the voices of Jaime Lannister, Samwell Tarly, Sir Merret Frey, and a brother of the night's watchman named Chett. Though the story is choppy because of the many different narratives the magnitude of the characters, the strength of the overall story, and the compelling nature of the characters work to make this manner of narrative seem driven, and not in a frenetic way.<br /><br />I rather enjoyed the third book in this epic saga. To me it's the strongest thus far, as many points of impact occur which really drive the plot along. Could it survive on its own outside of the first two books? Likely, but it would be less rich without them. I fully recommend this series. These are truly phenomenal books.in that it is told from the point of view of many different narrators.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|You HAVE to see this movie! This is one of those movies that when you are done watching it, you just feel good! I was pleasantly surprised at how great it was! And, what a neat concept - Home Exchange!?!
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I am a sucker for good romantic comedies.  I love Diane Lane and John Cusack.  How could this miss?  Well, it did.  The motivation behind it is Hollywood greed--who could really care about this script?  I could almost see the guys in a room shooting out old ideas they'd accrued from  watching too many bad films and tv shows they'd seen in the last 30 years...\\"Put dogs in it! A really big cute black one and a really cute little white one! Give them really cute names -- Mother Teresa, yah, that's great!  Make the guy a loveable rumpled loser--give him an occupation that doesn't make money!  Have to have a loveable gay couple as her buddies!  Give her a meddlesome but loveable sister!  Give her a loveable old dad with an appetite for the ladies! Who are, of course, loveable characters and live in a really cute and loveable trailer park\\"  argh... <br /> <br />This is on the level of a mediocre tv sitcom, circa 1974--maybe something out of Love Boat.  Too bad.  Diane Lane is a wonderful actress, with a talent for showing complexity and vulnerability.  She's totally wasted here in this shallow mess.  She's given the task of trying to throw off \\"witty\\" lines in the style of 1930's films and yet she's supposed to be the quiet,sincere pre-school teacher.  It doesn't work.  She's totally gorgeous and yet is supposed to be really insecure about trying to date again.  Nothing makes sense but who cares...this is Hollywood at work. <br /> <br />We're supposed to wonder if she's going to fall for the sexy guy who talks out of the corner of his mouth, but we know, from looking at the DVD cover she's going to end up with John Cuzack...duh <br /> <br />But, as others have written, if you don't expect art, and have two hours of your life to kill, then this might fit the bill.  The only reason I gave it any stars at all was that at least you get to see some lovely actors. Lane and Cuzack do their best. Stockard Channing looks embarassed in her curly hairdo but manages to give her usualsolid performance. I agree that Christopher Plummer looks like Cesar Romero here-- not a good thing.
1582701709|4.0|It's no secret that \\"The Secret\\" has been taught many times in many ways since ancient times. This book is helpful as a simple, down-to-earth reminder to think the way we know we should.    Some people object because, if our fortunes fail, we might feel burdened with self-blame. I think that using \\"the secret\\" might appear to fail sometimes, but this does not invalidate the concept; there's just more to it. For one thing, there are other people's wishes, which sometimes conflict with ours. The \\"we are all one\\" part of this book can confuse this issue. Another problem is that we sometimes have deeply hidden notions that we're not aware of - they can even stem from past lives - and these can compromise our new wishes. I don't think just reading and understanding this book can fully address that. But these complications don't change the fact that circumstances, conditions, etc., originate with thought, so the better our thoughts are the better our circumstances and conditions will be. This awareness, rather than burdening us with self-blame, empowers us with self-cause.    Many of the quotes from contributors and past philosophers are better than the author's. She gets downright goofy at times. \\"You must focus on the presence inside of you\\"...\\"That presence is the real you.\\" Hmmm... If \\"that presence\\" is me, then who's focusing on it? I got the impression that the author didn't fully understand what she was trying to say.    Still, there is much more right than wrong with this book. It is worth reading, but it is not the totality of the subject.
1582701709|1.0|I listened to the audio version of this book, and I am VERY glad my friend purchased it and not me.  This book is just horrible in every conceivable way.  Its based on the basic principle that if you put out positive thoughts, it brings positive things into your life.  Many religions teach this is one way or another. <br /> <br />This books takes it to new levels.  You can \\"think\\" yourself rich.  You can \\"think\\" hot women into your life.  As if women are objects to be had?  What kind of spirituality is that? <br /> <br />This book is for people who are all about themselves and are obsessed by material things, this book is NOT for those wanting spiritual enlightenment.
0060594896|5.0|An inspiring collection of stories, insights, and motivational tidbits to get you on your way. I have never read any of the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" series, but this was an amazing find and a great recommendation by a friend. As Jack Canfield put it himself, he spent his entire life discovering the principles he discusses, but we can skip all that work and get them all at once in his book - it's a heck of a deal! I will definitely come back to this book in the future, and I recommend that you consider it as well!
B0001Z53MY|5.0|Hybrid/SACD's are the new wave in music, but this DVD version is right up there with the SACD format. This is one of them - one of Elton John's greatest achievements. I compared this Hybrid to my regular SACD and CD versions. The sound is crisper and definitely separated between the five speakers (not counting the subwoofer). The rear speakers accentuated guitars and synthesizers/keyboards I had never heard before. Sure, it's more expensive, but buy it and sell your old version on Amazon! This also sounds great on just a regular CD player. \\"Funeral For A Friend\\" sounds like a new recording in this format and the extra songs are a welcome addition. I can't wait until more CD's are re-released in this format.
B00005K9LM|5.0|I will admit that Screaming is probably the best JP album, but Defenders is my favorite. So many great songs, Freewill Burning, Jawbreaker, Eat Me Alive, etc.. I mean, every single song is a hit. In that sense it seems like Defenders was crafted more to have a greater mass appeal than their previous stuff. The legendary guitar work is there, the presence of Rob Halford dominates as usual. Simply put, a classical album from a legendary band.
1400063515|5.0|First of all I had fun reading it. I was many times in a non-reading mood, and some of the drafts came to me. I print them out in order to read another time, and suddenly I was finding myself after reading a few pages. Joyful style but with content. Very interesting content. The stuff that make you thinking, thinking, and thinking again.<br /><br />The principles of the book are quite simple.<br /><br />The unknown is more frequent than we tend to think.<br /><br />The effect of unexpected things is rather huge. Much more than we dare to fantasize.<br /><br />\\"we know\\" is in many cases a big illusion. The human mind tends to think it knows, but does not always have solid ground for this dellusion of \\"I know\\".<br /><br />As in the good old medieval days, \\"experts\\" are many times empty heads with empty (and expensive) suits. The \\"truth\\" behind science, is limited to some areas, and in many areas  having a degree and posing scienist, is truth irelevant.<br /><br />\\"Narrative falacy\\" talks about our tendency to build stories around facts. In love it may serve a purpose, but when starting to beleive the stories and accomodating facts to the stories, things become stupid.<br /><br />Much more is there for the taking.
B00005K9LK|5.0|This has to be the defining Judas Preist album and arguably their best, although they would follow this one up with the impressive Defenders of the Faith. You have the widely known rockers like \\"Electric Eye,\\" \\"You've Go another Thing Coming,\\" and of course the title track, but all the cuts are impressive. It is Halford at his screaming best and then you have the two greatest Heavy Metal guitar players of all-time, Mr. K.K. Downing and Mr. Glenn Tipton, what more needs to be said about these two legends. If you aspire to be a fan of heavy metal, you must own this CD.
6305754969|5.0|This movie would be easy to confuse with the movie \\"Rio Bravo\\" bacause both movies carry a plot thread involving a drunken lawman who must be sobered up in order to keep him alive, but don't be deceived. These are two different movies with entirely different story lines. I have both titles in my collection and am glad to have both. <br />In this one James Mitchum gives an outstanding performance as the drunken marshal with John Wayne coming to his aid. John Wayne and James Caan sober him up with a witches brew of which, thank the Lord, we don't have to watch, or smell, the effects. <br />Mitchum is trying to protect a family of ranchers from the schemes of a land grabbing cattle baron played to cynical perfection by Ed Asner. (this was before he bacame beloved as Lou Grant on tv.) Before the movie is over the plot twists and turns like a coyote covered with fire ants, but everything comes out all right in the end. (except for Ed Asner, He's dead.) <br />In all a good action adventure, with some violence.  It is interesting to note that John Wayne is shot early in the film and is still suffering life threatening effects at the end.  A relief from so many movies of the period where the hero suffers major wounds and a couple of days later shoots down a herd of villains and whips the bad guy in a fist fight. <br />It is also worth noting that while this movie takes some humor from devices to sober up the co-star, neither this movie or \\"Rio Bravo\\" treat alcoholism as a humorous condition. In both movies, it is treated as a life-threatening and humiliating condition, with lingering and painful side-effects. <br />Sorry, neither Dean Martin, Angie Dickinson, Rick Nelson, or Walter Brennan appear in this movie. It doesn't need them.  If you want to see them, buy \\"Rio Bravo\\"
0553582461|5.0|There is no doubt that from beginning to end, this tale has compelled me to read non-stop until its decisive finish.  This final book in the series was no less fantastic to read and my only disappointment is that it had to end and I can no longer follow Fitz in his adventures.
0307346609|4.0|Frightening, harrowing, and even moving, World War Z is a stunning achievement.  Transcending the typical tropes of apocalyptic fiction, author Max Brooks(son of Mel) weaves a story that achieves that rare quality of making the apocalypse truly scary without making it appealing.  Brooks wrote in an interview recently that it scares him that there are so many people who \\"can't wait\\" for the end of the world to occur.  The survivalists, the ones who have cabins stocked with ammunition and food, who bide their time until civil order collapses and they are free to run amok.  Brooks works hard to keep the visceral appeal of the book to a minimum, focusing instead upon the human tragedy that comes with the end of all things.<br /><br />The living dead are an almost secondary element of the story.  They are never examined in detail, acting instead as an endless wave of deadly cannon fodder.  You won't find many \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" type stories of outposts among the dead here.  Brooks even coins the term LAMO(Last Man on Earth) to derisevly describe the people who hole up in their home fortresses.  Incidents like last stands and heoric hold-outs are referred to but not dwellled upon.<br /><br />The final half of the book, while providing hope for the future of humanity, cannot compete with the gripping description of the end of the world.  Things drag more than a little bit, and more time seems to be spent describing the new society that emerges from the ashes instead of talking about the walking dead.<br /><br />Still, it's a compelling read and full of excitement and terror.  At only a couple hundred pages, it goes by quickly but it will leave a lasting impression.
B00000612P|5.0|This album is what church aspires to be but can never be. Even more soulful, by a hair, than the \\"Truth\\" album by the Jeff Beck Group. In fact, just listen to these two back-to-back. If \\"Blues Deluxe\\" (from Truth) doesn't rip your blues-lovin' soul out, you ain't alive. And if \\"Ever Picture...\\" doesn't break your heart like it needs to be broke, just go out and pick yourself up some Justin Timberlake, bro, 'cause it's over.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|Listening to Avril's new CD,  I get the impression that a lot of people told her 'Under My Skin' was too dark, too angsty, and it sort of hurt her feelings.  'The Best Damn Thing' feels like an overcorrection. <br /> <br />It's ironic,  because while it's an undeniably high-energy album,  it's actually much much darker than 'Under My Skin.'  The songs here are full of anger, rage, childishness, jealousy, pettiness and spite,  and the Avril portrayed here is a rather nasty person.  Avril has already had to come out in public and say that it's all meant to be tongue-in-cheek. <br /> <br />What I've always liked best about Avril Lavigne is that underneath the tough-girl image,  she was clearly still the sweet, shy, inexperienced girl from a small town.  On 'The Best Damn Thing'  it feels like she's lost control of her own persona,  trying much too hard to live up to an image that isn't really her in the first place.  At least,  I hope it isn't her!  <br /> <br />If 'Best Damn Thing' is a reaction to the excesses of 'Under My Skin,'  then hopefully her fourth album will be a reaction to the excesses of this one.

B000HLDFM2|5.0|Having seen all of Park Chan-Wook's Revenge Trilogy, I can honestly say that Oldboy is the best of the three.  I was luke-warm towards Mr. Vengeance, but I loved Lady Vengeance.  It seemed to take what was done in Mr. Vengeance and add so much more depth of plot and image to it.  But Oldboy stands alone.  It is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Why?  First, you will rarely experience a movie so violent, and yet so full of true beauty.  The shots in this film are just phenomenal.  The movement, and the framing of each character, the motifs that recur and deal an emotional sting whenever they arrive, the graceful ballet of Oh Dae-su's battles, it is all magnificent.  Forget Tarantino; this film reaches to the heights of Welles, Fellini, Coppola, etc.  I am not kidding in the least.  It is that good. <br /> <br />This film is worth anything you pay for it, but the boxset is remarkable.    There are excellent documentaries taking you through the process of filming, as well as the first volume of the Oldboy comic (similar to Sin City's special edition...and this box won't fall apart on you). <br /> <br />Lady Vengeance was a brilliant follow-up to Oldboy, but I can only hope Park Chan-Wook is able to again reach the cinematic brilliance - the interplay between the cinematography, the movement of the camera, the absolutely superb acting and imagery, the saliency of the colors, etc. - that is Oldboy.  Buy this film.
B00008EY9G|4.0|The movie begins with a subplot of a killer's interview.  Next, on a dark and stormy night, many lives will come together.  George York (John C. McGinley - Dr. Cox from Scrubs) along with his wife Alice and stepson Timothy have a blowout.  Alice is hit by limo driver Ed (John Cusack) driving movie star Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay).  They rush to the closest phone, which is at an out-of-the-way hotel.  Joining them for the evening, also trapped by the storm and flooding, is hooker Paris (how appropriate) played by Amanda Peet, and Officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey - don't Busey's make the best bad guys?), and a young couple whose passtime is arguing.<br /><br />Rhodes' prisoner escapes, and then people begin to turn up dead.  Secrets are revealed, there are arguments, a lot of creeping around in the rain, and nail-biting suspense.  But there's more to this movie than just the typical whodunit.  Where is the connection between these people?  The key to the puzzle is much more complex than you think.  The plot twists and twists again in a most satisfying manner.  I can't say any more without revealing spoilers.<br /><br />John Cusack and Ray Liotta give stellar performances, and John C. McGinley is good in everything he does.  The film is well photographed and the atmosphere is sufficiently dreary to create the required mood.  This is a great movie for a group of friends and a large bowl of buttered popcorn.  Keep the lights on.  Enjoy!
0802130208|5.0|A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES will make you literally laugh out loud, until your sides hurt. It's one of those books that you can read over and over again, and appreciate it anew all over again. This depth, the capacity for rereading and reinterpretation, makes it a true masterpiece of world literature, comparable only to Don Quixote, Shakespeare's Falstaff, Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel, and Joyce's Ulysses.<br /><br />The main character Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the supreme creations of the human imagination. He is obsessed with medieval culture and literature and interprets everything that happens in terms of Boethius's CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY and famous \\"wheel of fortune,\\" personified as the goddess Fortuna. He rages against Fortuna for taking him on a downward spiral, even when his fate is mostly the result of his own perverse actions. \\"With the breakdown of the Medieval system,\\" he writes in his Big Chief notebook, \\"the gods of Chaos, Lunacy, and Bad Taste gained ascendancy.\\" While he rages against the decadence of the modern world, he watches every new hollywood movie several times (criticizing it out loud in the theater) and stuffs himself with hot dogs, jelly doughnuts, and \\"Dr. Nut\\" soda.<br /><br />Igantius would be a medieval professor (and Toole based the character on an English professor he knew), but for his inability to leave New Orleans and adjust to any kind of normal job. He retells obsessively the story of one journey outside New Orleans on a Greyhound double-decker Scenicruiser as an apocalyptic journey into the \\"heart of darkness,\\" culminating in the nefarious theft of his wool plaid lumber jacket from the bathroom of the college where he was interviewing for a teaching job.<br /><br />His \\"girlfriend\\" is a Jewish liberal from New York, Myrna, who believes that sex is the answer to all problems everywhere, especially for minorities! while Ignatius finds sex repelling, preferring the comfort of his self-love.<br /><br />In the novel, Ignatius comes up against a hilarious selection of characters that could only exist in the New Orleans of the early 60's. Jones, a black man forced to work for below minimum wage at the Night of Joy bar, is really just as funny as Ignatius. Told by his boss to hail customers from the sidewalk, he goes outside and calls, \\"Whoa! Come in, see Mis Harla O'Horror dancin with her pet. Guarantee one hunner percent real plantation dancin. Every mother------- drink got a guarantee knockout drop. Whoa! Everybody guarantee to catch them some clap off they glass. Hey! . . . Night of Joy got genuine color people workin below minimum wage.

0156012197|5.0|<br />I will review the book first then make some comments on the translation. <br /> <br />This is perhaps the best children's book written. I read it for the first time (Woods translation) a couple of weeks ago, and am glad that I did. Young and old alike can enjoy and treasure it. The fox is a great teacher about friendship, and how one truly sees only with the heart. Plus, the Little Prince's descriptions of the grownups he encountered on various planets is a concise but brilliant satire on how people lose sight of the forest for the trees as they get older. This is a must-have for anyone.  <br /> <br />Now for the translation. Here are some excerpts from the old and new translations so that you can compare them. <br /> <br />Old Translation: <br />\\"For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.\\" <br /> <br />New Translation: <br />\\"For the king insisted that his authority be universally respected. He would tolerate no disobedience, being an absolute monarch. But since he was a kindly man, all his commands were reasonable.\\" <br /> <br />Old Translation: <br />\\"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.\\" <br /> <br />New Translation: <br />\\"Go look at the roses again. You'll understand that yours is the only rose in all the world. The come back to say good-bye, and I'll make you the gift of a secret.\\" <br /> <br />I read the old translation first, having checked it out from the library. I'm not sure how to describe the niceties of the grammatical differences between the translations, but the Woods translation to me seems more poetic, whereas the new translation seems to be more colloquial. I don't think that the new translation prevents you from enjoying the story atall, and I think it's great that the full-color art was restored. In other words, I don't think that this new edition should be avoided; it's well-worth buying and reading. Still, I personally think it would be a good idea to read the old translation. You can probably find it at your local library, or from one of the used book sellers here on Amazon.
B000002OX5|4.0|To me this is the Who at the height of their powers and my second favorite album by them, falling only behind the \\"Meaty, Beaty Big and Bouncy\\" compilation. There's not much to say about the music that hasn't been said before. Everything's ferocious, the lyrics are wonderful and even the \\"commercials\\" are fun. What's more this re-issue also comes with a bounty of interesting bonus tracks. It would have been nicer if the bonus material was put on a second disc to preserve the album in it's original form, but that's splitting hairs. Highly recommended.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|The movie was enjoyable enough but I felt it lacked that romantic \\"spark\\" between the two couples featured in the film. The basic premise: Two women decide to trade homes, both of them looking to escape from recent boyfriend troubles. One comes to America, one goes to the English countryside and (you could predict this, right?), they encounter new guys, with new potentials.<br /><br />  Everyone's acting is up to snuff but the film still came across as mildly entertaining and certainly not on my \\"Top Ten\\" list of romantic comedies.<br /><br />  However, there were some special moments that stood out, including:<br /><br />1. The always watchable Jack Black, with his irreverent wit, playing against type as a pretty decent guy in this film. He can't completely hold in his wild nature, but he is relatively restrained.<br /><br />2. Eli Wallach. He's a legend and every move of his is thought out.<br /><br />3. The bonus features, including comments from the crew and cast about making the movie. Kate Winslet admits her fears about trying to be fun, the director talks about the process of making this film, etc. The commentary lends insight into the whole creative enterprise, from start to finish, and would be interesting for budding film enthusiasts to see.
1400063515|5.0|If, as Socrates would have it, the only true knowledge is knowledge of one's own ignorance, then Nassim Nicholas Taleb is the world's greatest living teacher.  In The Black Swan, Taleb's second book for laypeople, he gives a full treatment to concepts briefly explored in his first book \\"Fooled by Randomness.\\"  The Black Swan is basically a sequel to that book, but much more focused, detailed and scholarly.  This is a book of serious philosophy that reads like a stand-up comedy routine.  (Think Larry David...)<br /><br />The Black Swan is probably the strongest statement of enlightened empiricism since Ernst Mach refused to acknowledge the existence of the atom.  Of course, in theory, everyone today is supposed to be an empiricist - all right-thinking intellectuals claim to base their views solely on positive scientific observation.  But very few sincerely confront the implications of rigorous empiricism.  Specifically, few confront \\"the problem of induction,\\" illustrated here by the story of the black swan.<br /><br />Briefly: observing an event once does not predict it will occur again in the future.  This remains true regardless of the number of observations one adds to the pile.  Or, as Taleb, recapitulating David Hume, has it: the observation of even a million white swans does not justify the statement \\"all swans are white.\\"  There is no way to know that somewhere out there a black swan is not hiding, disproving the rule and nullifying  our \\"knowledge\\" of swans.  The problem of induction tells us that we cannot really learn from our experiences.  It makes knowledge very problematic, if not impossible.  And yet, humans do behave -almost without exception- as though they believe that experience teaches us lessons.  This is forgivable; there is no better path to knowledge.  But before proceeding, one must account for the limits that the problem of induction places on our claims to knowledge.  And humans seem, at every turn, to lack this critical self-awareness.<br /><br />In one of the many humorous anecdotes that seem to comprise this entire book, Taleb recounts how he learned his extreme skepticism from his first boss, a French gentleman trader who insisted that he should not worry about the fluctuating values of economic indicators.  (Indeed, Taleb proudly declares that, to this day, he remains blissfully ignorant of  supposedly crucial \\"indicators\\" like housing starts and consumer spending.  This is a shocking statement from a guy whose day job is managing a hedge fund.)  Even if these \\"common knowledge\\" indicators are predictive of anything (dubious - see above), they are useless to you because everyone else is already accounting for them.  They are \\"white swans,\\" or common sense.  Regardless of their magnitude, white swans are basically irrelevant to the trader - they have already been impounded into the market.  In this environment, one can only profitably concern oneself with those bets which others are systematically ignoring - bets on those highly unlikely, but highly consequential events that utterly defy the conventional wisdom.  What Taleb ought to worry about, the Frenchman warned, was not the prospect of a quarter-percent rise in interest rates, but a plane hitting the World Trade Center!<br /><br />Yep, the precise facts of 9-11 were actually presaged by this French gentlemen, as a rogue wave that just might be lurking over the horizon.  And, to the contemporary American mind, this is THE quintessential Black Swan.  Of course, the Frenchman's insight was just a coincidence - the thing with Black Swans is that they cannot be foreseen.<br /><br />Taleb explains that conventional social scientists use induction to collect data, which is then plotted on the good old Gaussian bellcurve.  With characteristic silliness, Taleb dubs the land of the bellcurve \\"Mediocristan\\" - and informs us that it is the natural habitat of the white swan.  He contrasts Mediocristan with \\"Extremistan\\" - where chaos reigns, the wholly unexpected happens, power laws and fractal geometry apply and the bellcurve does not.  Taleb's fictional/metaphorical 'stans' share something with the 'stans' of the real world: very ill-defined borders.  Indeed, one can never tell whether one is in the relatively safe territory of Mediocristan or if one has wandered into the lawless tribal regions of Extremistan.  The bellcurve can only help you in Mediocristan, but you have no way of knowing whether you have strayed into Extremistan - beyond the bellcurve's jurisdiction.  This means that bellcurves are of no reliable use, anywhere.  The full implications of this take a while to sink in, and are sure to cause huge controversy.  In July, Taleb will debate Charles Murray (author of -what else?- the Bell Curve).  I'll let you know who wins.<br /><br />Taleb frames his whole argument much more entertainingly than I could here, and he bolsters it with an astonishing command of both cutting-edge social science and the entire history of philosophy.  This is an astonishing work of serious philosophy, and it reads like pulp fiction.  Readers who enjoyed FBR will find here the same dry wit, the same literary erudition, and deep sense of the absurd that made that book so much fun.  But this is better, by an order of magnitude - easily the best book I have read in 5 years.  I smell a timely pop-science bestseller here to rival Gladwell or Surowiecki, but this is also a classic that will be read for decades to come.and fractal geometry apply and the bellcurve does not.

1594481938|1.0|The only reason I finished this book was it was a book club pick - I read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit. This book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read. I can't believe so many people are giving it a good review. The constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read. Don't bother!
B000LAZDQA|1.0|\\"Shortbus\\" is a strange mix of magic and social realism, which could make for a very witty, engaging film. This movie though flounders around in half-realized concepts which never really gel together. The dialogue comes off as trite and John Cameron Mitchell's vision of New York is full of whiny self-involved, emotionally underdeveloped people who hang out in a well-lit sex club. The sex scenes are the only fun in the film, but on the whole, \\"Shortbus\\" was a pretty disappointing ride.
075640407X|5.0|I finished reading Patrick Rothfuss's The Name of the Wind yesterday, and after a mere 2 hours or so picked it up and started reading it again.  Now why in the world would I do this?  I asked myself that question a few times and my answer is:<br /><br />* It's great writing.<br />  The language Rothfuss uses is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.  I found myself rereading sections simply because they were so delightfully and beautifully written.  He has a poetical turn of phrase, and there are passages that simply sing.<br /><br />* But it's also a riveting story.<br />  The story pulled me in, immersing me in Kvothe's world so much that I half expected to see the scrael scuttling through my backyard (a truly terrifying thought for anyone who hates spiders as passionately as I do).<br /><br />* And the characters are absolutely believable.<br />  Kvothe is a living and breathing character who practically leaps off the page--unruly red hair and eyes bright green like new growth grass.  He is absolutely believable, especially to anyone who remembers being a boy and the awkwardness that comes with growing up.<br /><br />I guess that's three answers.<br /><br />Anyway, run out and grab this book.  Grab two.  It's that good.
1586217194|2.0|I found that overall, Blink does not work well in Audio CD format. Gladwell uses the same words and expressions and concepts over and over. If I hear the phrase, \\"thin slicing\\" again, I might scream.  It becomes highly repetitive and irritating. In my opinion, he speaks too slowly, and softly, which exacerbates the problem. If one were reading the book, one could skip forward or read more quickly to control this problem, and his voice wouldn't be an issue. <br /> <br />As a general comment on the CD--and I assume this applies to the book as well-- I found that Gladwell was not very scientific. And yet, he acts like he is. Numerous assumptions are made when describing the results of certain studies, tests, and situations, and WHY they turned out a particular way. I found myself feeling irritated as the Cd attempted to push me into accepting the explanations proferred by Gladwell or the social 'scientists' whose work he was describing.  <br /> <br />I also think that ultimately Gladwell does not do a good job of actually pinning down the subject, or providing a very cohesive framework for it. He explores issues of faulty and correct decision making, and the CD provides a lot of food for thought, but if you think you will be able to increase your own decision making powers after listening to this tape, don't bet on it. The stories of how impressions can be accurate or inaccurate --regarding the authenticity of art objects, whether couples divorce, how to determine whether an artist can sell records, New Coke, issues of racial bias, etc.-- are all interesting, but don't leave one with a day to day framework for making decisions in one's everyday life. Generally, one is left with--be an expert, but don't over examine the issue to death or apart from a specific whole, make sure you are being objective, get a quick look at some types of things, but only in certain circumstances, sometimes you can't do a quick review unless you are aware of a key factor, beware of biases like looks and race, etc. Um....I either already knew it, or it's too vague to apply.
B000O178BY|5.0|Having been a listener and fan for almost 17 years, this album flows along with natural progression.  As a series, all of the releases seem to have followed along with Trent's changing priorities and influences.  How wonderful to release something related to a political mindset when there is such a tremendous forum.  For myself, being a politically active and community-oriented person, this album addresses many of the fears and frustrations that are so prevalent in the US today.  The campaign for the album has been remarkable and everything about it seems to be quintessentially Trent.   <br /> <br />Listening to some of the songs (over and over), I couldn't help but be reminded of some classic rock standards- \\"Capital G\\", which I loved, had a beat reminiscent of Queen's \\"Body Language\\"...and the opening sequence, which instantly brought to mind the terror of a martial law scenario, made me think of Ministry- whose Al Jourgenson has worked with Trent on several projects.   <br /> <br />If you're politically uninitiated or apathetic- don't bother.  If you realize there's something worth fighting for, this will be appreciated.  The value of the album, as always, is in the message.  The whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. <br />
B000IHYY52|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this disc since purchasing it a couple of weeks ago.  The picture quality is really nice but 1080p is not available.  Also, there is no PCM 5.1 either.  This is the only reason that I gave it four instead of five stars. <br /> <br />Beyond that, this really is a neat collection of artists/music.  I usually pop this thing in every night for a couple of minutes or end up listening to the entire list.  If you have an interest in learning more about jazz and its different genres then give this disc a listen.  I am actively pursuing more jazz since purchasing this disc.
1892005034|5.0|This book has been the missing link for me in my journey to heal others through touch and to also heal the wounds of my past.  I have studied much in the subjects of Buddhism, psychology and other subjects related to our internal world, but it was this book that helped open me to my own need to feel my own hurts equally as I have created a space for others.  Having had an extremely violent father, I had become a protector--my role as a child w/my siblings.  But, until this book, I had never given a voice to my own needs regarding those experiences.  There is not enough that I could say that would express the freedom and light heartedness I experience everyday.  I feel as though I've been given a second chance to really find a partner for my life who wants to create a truly spirtual relationship with me.  I had never thought that was possible until now.  I will be forever greatful to Mr. Rosenberg and to the therapist who could see me deeply enough to suggest the book.  I'm looking forward to receiving my cd/dvd study course in the mail soon so that I may assist others.  Thank you so much.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|Jesus this is horrible Cd. I loved Incubus when they first came out but slowly I realized there would never be another: Enjoy Incubus, Fungus, or S.C.I.E.N.C.E album ever again. Don't get me wrong I don't think that they need to repeat every album but come on! You can only write so many love songs for god's sake. This Cd makes me really think that they have run out of creative ideas and now they are doing whatever they can to get on the radio.
B000O178BY|5.0|With Year Zero, NIN has returned. While I liked \\"With Teeth\\", because I like all of Trent Reznor's work, I missed the instrumentals and fillers that were always a staple of previous NIN albums.  <br /> <br />After 1 listen I knew I would like this album but it took me 3 complete listens to fully appreciate the concept of this album. I agree with other reviews that most tracks are not going to be radio staples on their own. You need to hear the album in its entirety to appreciate each track. The album has such a great flow.  So please, listen to it more then once before passing judgement. <br /> <br /> I think the problem that most listeners have, especially those whom are not so called diehard fans, is that when you listen to a new NIN album your always trying to compare it with Trent's masterpiece \\"The Downward Spiral\\". You just can't do that. That was a special album that came out during a certain period of time and cannot be replicated. Partly because times are different now. That being said, I feel if \\"Year Zero\\" was released in '94 and the \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was released in '07, people would say \\"TDS\\" doesn't sound like \\"Year Zero.  <br /> <br />This album is better that anything out there now in the music scene. It is better then 'With Teeth\\" and compares greatly with \\"The Fragile\\". I can't wait for the second part of this concept album to come out next year. I'm glad the follow up will be released separately instead of making this a double album. It gives us fans something else to look forward to. In today's music scene, there's not much we look forward to.
B000HT3Q14|4.0|I've always loved the movie, and while it looks great in HD, it's very reminiscent of the first few DVDs that came out. It has quite a few defects just during normal playback, and the additional content is exactly the same as it is on the DVD... which looked bad on the original, and looks TERRIBLE now.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there aren't many HD DVDs to choose from yet, but having your expectations set at a reasonable level can't hurt. :/ I suspect this one will be like the first Tron DVD release, and coming out a ways down the road (assuming the format survives) to compare against newer releases.
B000O178BY|3.0|With all the wonderfully creative, yet somewhat pretentious guerrilla style marketing and hype Nine Inch Nails 5th studio release has arrived,...somewhat. After a short 2 year hiatus Year Zero marks the bleak futuristic fall of humanity into religious obscurity and a police state of tyrannical right wing theocrats and their incessant lust for power and wealth. And with this not so new premonition comes a conceptual work that fails to spark the once trademark fire that Nine Inch Nails was know to once elicit.<br /><br />  Year Zero is quite a fractured piece of work by way of its deliberate minimalist electronic sound but even within that the album can't seem to pace nor distinguish itself as a concept album of any real significance. Tracks like \\"HYPERPOWER\\" dredge up crunching guitar riffs, marching feet and chanting to the likes of earlier NIN and Ministry  tracks but quickly fall to the predominantly electro beat driven tempo of the album. Year Zero is quite noisy and erratic at times but more than that the vast majority of sounds become monotonous and indistinguishable at times, even recycling themselves into other songs. Few of the tracks if any on Year Zero have the production complexity and creativity that set prior NIN albums apart from their peers such as \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and even at time tries to rekindle the ingenuity captured on \\"With Teeth\\" by the layering of vocal tracks closing out the last minute or so of \\"Capital G\\" similar to the that of the perfectly rendered \\"All the Love in the World\\".<br /><br />  Year Zero's shining moments seem to be when Reznor falls back on his uncanny ability to produce melodic and pop sensible hooks that solidify songs like \\"The Good Soldier\\", \\"Capital G\\" and \\"Meet Your Master\\" among other forgettable tracks like \\"The Beginning of the End\\" and \\"Survivalism\\". But as a whole this album falls into the realm of many electronic rock numbers and fails to aurally differentiate Reznors musical genius from that of dozens of other laptop based garage bands out there in the underground.<br /><br />  Time equals quality with some things and maybe taking 4-5 years to make a record isn't a bad thing when you are enveloped by an immersing soundscape of music as Reznor has so wonderfully done before. Is it possible that both NIN and Reznor have lost their musical relevance by venturing out of their self loathing Industrial roots and into the overgrown arena of politics and war? But then again maybe Reznor just wants to make a political statement in the form of a noisy electro-rock pounding raging against current government regimes and other religious right wing factions with an election year oh so close at hand. I'd like to think the ladder.<br /><br />Also for other die hard NIN fans if you have ever heard of a band called Prick listen to the track \\"Riverhead\\" from the 3:00 mark until the end and you can understand why I feel like I have heard Year Zero before.from that of dozens of other laptop based garage bands out there in the underground.  <br /> <br />  Time equals quality with some things and maybe taking 4-5 years to make a record isn't a bad thing when you are enveloped by an immersing soundscape of music as Reznor has so wonderfully done before.

1577314808|5.0|I wasn't going to write anything, but some of these other reviews have compelled me to do so.  People are criticizing Tolle for, what they seem to think is, idealism and hoopla and logical falicies.  But this book holds no such things.  Someone actually wrote a critical review because \\"it doesn't work.\\"  That is sad, because this reader missed the whole point of this book.  This book is not a quick fix, nor does it claim to be.  IT IS A WAY OF LIVING.   <br /> <br />     Yes, Tolle claims his method will change your life, but he does not claim that you will be able to exercise the Power of Now effectively as soon as you put down the book.  That impatience is precisely what the book is trying to alleviate. Just like yoga and meditation (which this book is very close to and works very well with) this is a lifelong practice. <br /> <br />     For example, try concentrating on the next 10 breaths you have  Follow the breath in. Follow it out.  Don't think about them, just notice them, without one other thought entering your mind.............yeah, it's hard as hell. But wouldn't it be nice?  That is where this book can take you, but you must not look at your inability to complete this task as a fallacy of this book.  Taking Tolle's advice rather, fully accept where you are in the process at this time, right now. <br />  <br />   And I have to defend Tolle's comment that gays and women are closer to enlightenment than heterosexual men, which was criticized in a review below mine.  They aren't closer to enlightenment simply because they are gay or because they are female, and no, Tolle doesn't claim God has something against straight guys.  Women and gays TEND to be closer to enlightenment because MOST of the time women and gays are more in touch with there feelings, and less likely to suppress them and try to be \\"tough,\\" like the stereotypical straight American male. Can anyone argue with that?  <br />   <br />   And I have to address the criticism of Tolle for his concept that this very moment is outside of the realm of time (past and future).  You can only argue with this if you are not in this moment.  Sure, we all now that every minute is a part of time, part of a past and future, but if you are truly IN this moment, you cannot have a concept of past and future, which in essence means that you are not in the grasp of the past and future, you are \\"free of time.\\"  For example, when you tried the breathing exercise above, if you had even one breath of pure presence, you know what I am talking about, there is a freedom in each moment. I know it is hard to grasp, for me as well, but I urge you, especially the person who wrote that comment, to continue trying, because although I have only had glimpses, there is nothing like the feeling you get when you truly experience this very moment, with all of its wonder, with every sound, with every feeling, with every sight.  We have been given and infinite supply of these moments, and this book at least helps us find a way to appreciate them.   <br />  <br />  This book has begun to change my life.  It also led me to the book \\"wherever you go, there you are,\\" which is also a life-changing read. Hope this helped you out a little. Good luck.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPCF|5.0|This movie is really good and seemed a little bit different than the average animated film these days. There is a very good message and lesson to be learned here. Being different isn't a bad thing. The animation is fantastic and you can learn a thing or two about these animals as the makers of this movie seem to mix factual situations in with the fantasy world of this film. A really good mix of comedy and heart and the DVD transfer looks fantastic!

B00007AJF8|2.0|im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious \\"adaptation\\"), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz.

B000065U1N|2.0|this certainly must rank among the noisiest movies ever made. whether or not it has merit as a tale probably rests as much with your personal politics as anything else, but as an artistic creation (ive never been a ridley scott fan) it is little more than an updated version of superior older movies like \\"battleground\\". stereotypical characterizations by wooden actors, personified by the always hunky but always dull josh hartnett. full of sound & fury ... <br />
B000025RX4|5.0|The album JOHNNY WINTER AND provides guitar purists with one of rock's great guitar ballads, LET THE MUSIC PLAY.  From the moment the first Am is strummed, the guitar player knows this song is a serious attempt at classic rock guitar.<br /><br />Winter and fellow guitarist, former McCoy's guitarist, Rick Derringer take the listener into a soulful journey of guitar playing that actually over power the lyrics of the song.  From the first hard hitting lick of the lead intro, LET THE MUSIC PLAY definately puts Winter into the league of other great rock guitarists, leaving the throne of the white blues guitarist and claiming his place in the 'hallso of great rock guitar' with all the drama and imagery we guitarists so love from this genera.  The rest of the album is great, but LET THE MUSIC PLAY will always be one of my top ten guitar ballads.  If for nothing else, buy this CD for this song.  I assure you, the rest of the album won't dissapoint.
B0002W4SWC|4.0|i was pleasantly surprised upon catching up 6 years later with this chick brit flick. renee zellwegger repays england for vivien leigh being cast as scarlett, and she proves utterly charming in this modern take on a jane austen novel (and arguably better than any of the actual austen-based movies of the past decade). colin firth and even the usually smarmy hugh grant are excellent as her beaux: the boorish gentleman and the smooth bounder. great fun, but i hear the sequel is dreadful, so i shall steer clear.
0975991477|2.0|I find this idea interesting, but I really didn't get anything more from the book than I did from listening to his interview on the BrainSync podcast - he used a number of the same analogies and they both end in the same place ([...])    Overall, I felt like it was too \\"dumb down\\" -- as if the author didn't think the masses could grasp the theory.
B000O178BY|5.0|Reznor isn't falling off. I buried myself in this idea after the release of With Teeth, which although contained its fair share of highlights featured mostly filler songs which I oft found myself skipping over. As an avid fan of Nine Inch Nails, I found myself wondering if Trent's best days were behind him. Would he ever get back to the form of his first four albums? Had he set the bar too high? <br /> <br />When I learned that NIN was already ready to release another album, less than two years after their last (a highly unusual attribute for Trent, who usually takes some time between albums), I was highly critical. I remained critical until I actually obtained a copy of Year Zero, and gave it a chance from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />I was beside myself. I kept interested and attuned throughout every song. It was a sound that I had never heard before, and I'm a fairly educated music listener. Anyone who tries to relate this CD to any of Reznor's early work is doing so in vain, because Year Zero sounds nothing like anything he's ever done before or like anything ever done before in the music industry. When you pop in the CD, Trent wastes no time transporting you into a noisy and chaotic yet symphonic future world. By the time you are done listening through the album, you will feel overwhelmed as to where to start listening again. Every track seems to carry a personal high point on the album. <br /> <br />God, am I relieved with the release of this album. It met and surpassed all  expectations I had for the album. With the lack of quality and originality in music over recent years, it is most definitely a relief to listen to Year Zero. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this album.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is absolutely the best genre show since the X-Files, only without the convoluted mythology. Yes, there is a deep mythos for this series, but answers are given along the way, loose ends are tied up, and the pay-off is very rewarding. I was a big Buffy fan back in the day, but that show got old with all of its tongue-in-cheek cutsiness and it's \\"holier than thou\\" characters. But \\"Supernatural\\" surpasses all that and gives me a REAL monster hunting show to love. This show is real, personable, touching, often times hilarious, and always worth your attention and support. I can't wait to see where this series goes but, they've won me over. I'll be with them til the end.    Now go buy it! Go! Hurry!
B000O178BY|5.0|Last night I checked a handful of the major chains for the best price on this album and found one and went out to get it earlier this evening. I've streamed the album from the Year Zero site and I knew I needed to hear this album on my car's system. After loading the CD, I began experiencing the visceral world of this high concept album. It's sleek, noisy, aggressive and a return to the industrial stomps of a NIN we all have loved. With the release of With Teeth and going through the sounds and lyrics of that album, I thought, well crap Trent's just weak without drugs and I hope he can muster the creativity he has shown on all the other NIN outputs. This is that album. It's been a few years since Trent's been clean and finally his mind has cleared to create something relevant and brilliant. I'm not going to provide the usual commentary on the sci-fi post-apocalyptic climate of this album. I'm not going to say this is one of those albums you must have in your collection. Well, maybe you should if are into NIN, this album will not disappoint.
0671027344|5.0|Charlie, a strange but lovable character, does more than his share of adolescent self-discovery while restlessly going through his first year of high school. Although Charlie's circumstances are extreme, this is an enjoyable read for any teenager (current or former) who has ever felt anxious about whom he or she is, and what her or his place is in the world.  Stephen Chbosky writes with a fresh flair, a book I will not soon forget.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|You know the feeling...that feeling of \\"Oh my gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end?\\"  Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.   Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.  A huge disappoinment especially since director DeNiro is such a talented actor.  Skip it.
B000MZHW40|4.0|This movie is a very good drama about the illegal african diamond trading and it's effects on local economies and goverments.  The movie does a great job at showing the harsh and tough to face details of what may be occuring in the \\"conflict countries\\" such as Sierra Lion.  Leonardo Di Caprio plays an illeagal Diamond trader who meets a local fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) that has hidden away a secret that can change both of their lives.  Di Caprio wants to leave africa and his way of life once and for all, Hounsou wants to get his family back and into a safe place.  With the help of Jennifer Connely, a reporter, they hunt thier way back to a place where Housou's character endured horrible traumas.   <br />   This is an action packed film with some nice twists, and overall eye opening drama to what is occuring even today.  Rent this, buy this, you won't be dissapointed.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|I usually do not feel compelled to write reviews but after reading all of the negative ones for this film, I felt like I should; I saw it in theaters and  enjoyed it so much that I bought it when it came out a couple of weeks ago.  Yes, the movie is long and slow in parts such as the beginning, but it's still extremely well done.  I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars but it's not an option - the only thing keeping it from the full five stars is its length (nearly 3 hours).  It is an interesting story with a unique inside look at things we otherwise do not get the chance to see - not just the beginning of the CIA, but also of the infamous Skull and Bones secret society of Yale.  The cinemetography is beautiful and all of the cast gives believable, strong performances.  So, while it is long, it's also gripping and compelling.  I don't see where all of the bad reviews are coming from because it is a generally good film that keeps you enthralled with the story - and it's a good story.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I first heard Brandi Carlile when she came for a promotion to Amazon. It was a real knock out performance. I went back and ordered her full album. I've been hooked on to it ever since. Its one of the best albums I've bought in the recent past. This is a great start to what I expect to be a brilliant career.
B00003CXUM|5.0|I bought this DVD after reading a review on a magazine about they way it was beautifully shot and referring to the movie as a wonder to look at. Well, I have to say that this movie by far exceeded my already grand expectations of it. It truly is like entering a dream in which you feel like a close spectator of a reality that defies reality. You know it is not real; yet, you can't help but stare and believe. The scenary is just something that will haunt you for days. The music is just amazing and complements the visual effects very well. It adds to the surreal  dream-like aura. The dialogue does not waste a single line. From the get-go, we are being seduced into a trance that allows the movie to capture us and take our imagination to another place. This movie is like a hallucinogenic that allows us to marvel at the simplest of things like the sound of a heavy rain. It has taught me that sometimes you say the most by not saying much and just listening and observing. That's what you should all do...get this movie, listen and observe.
B000784WMW|3.0|I definitely liked the Masterpiece version better.  There is NO chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester!!!  Timothy Dalton has some moments of brilliance but overall I found this version to be quite insipid.  Jane may be more true to character but she played this role with not much variations.  The two actors in the masterpiece theater version sizzled with chemistry!  Maybe that was not what Bronte had in mind but what entertainment!!!!
B000LC55F2|4.0|The Prestige is a period piece fantasy made into something resembling reality.  At its heart it relies on a device from science fiction, a machine that transports people and objects by replicating them.  How such a device might work is beside the intent of the movie.  And that's okay.  Movie goers accept premises and then follow the action without any need to examine the premise further.  However I think that director Christopher Nolan might have looked more closely at the consequences of his premise.  Replicating objects with electricity (pretty far-fetched of course) and moving them some distance from the replicating point is quite a feat even in the imagination.  But what to do with the replications?  Nolan's solution: kill them off.  In fact kill off the original and keep the replication.<br /><br />Now if you are magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson) and you know that you are about to die, and in fact in a most unpleasant way by drowning, I think you might be a little hesitant to perform the trick, even though a replication of you will come to life and live on.  Note that both the replication and the original Angier would want to live and prefer that the other be the one to die.<br /><br />Nolan thought about this and that is why one is forced to die.  Nolan probably would have himself preferred to keep the original and do away with the duplicate, but then the trick wouldn't work properly since the original would still be in place and not moved at all.<br /><br />This is an old theme in science fiction and Nolan does not attempt to improve on it.  And again that's okay.  But another problem with the way the premise is handled is that, although surely Angier would want to go one up on his nemesis, fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and dazzle the world with this amazing trick, he might have at some point just replicated some pound notes or some bullion.  If Borden had gotten hold of the machine, maybe he could have replicated Scarlett Johansson so that he and Fallon could have one each for themselves.  (And one for me would be nice as well.)  Or he could have replicated his beloved daughter.<br /><br />What I am pointing to is the irony in the way the machine was used as a vehicle for a magic trick.  The trick as performed is so much less amazing than the real magic that could have been displayed, that of replicating enormously complex objects like human beings.  Nobody in the film seems to realize this.  This is perhaps the major--shall we say--plot cheesiness.  Another, as pointed out elsewhere, is that the question Angier asks of Borden, \\"Which knot did you use?\\" The question is bogus as is his answer, \\"I don't know,\\" since Julia was still tied and the knot could be seen.  Also there is the question of what to do with all those bodies being created?  We see them near the end of the film in the water boxes.  Seems a bit of a stretch to make all those new boxes and just leave the bodies there.  Somebody might call the bobbies, don't you think?<br /><br />For these reasons I am beginning to wonder if Nolan is getting a little careless or if he has been corrupted by success to the point where he no longer cares about logical consistency and artistic rigor.  Perhaps we'll see in his next opus.  However scheduled for release next year is The Dark Knight another Batman caper starring Christian Bale.<br /><br />Putting all this aside, the movie is entertaining and thought provoking.  Nolan's time-stirred delineation of the plot is done well and kept this viewer interested.  I also liked the razor sharp  psychological tension created between Borden and Angier as they compete against each other.  And the many surprising plot twists and turns--something that Nolan does very well--were nice.<br /><br />And the cast was excellent.  Michael Caine who plays the old magician and front man Cutter was perfect, and the glimpse or two we get of Scarlett Johansson was more than agreeable.  Bale and Jackson were very good as well.  But I especially liked Rebecca Hall who played Borden's wife Sarah.  I thought she was outstanding.<br /><br />Now that Christopher Nolan has had back to back commercial successes with Batman Begins (2005), and The Prestige (2006), maybe it's time to think about where his career is going.  Is he going to become a film maker known for his artistry like Stanley Kubrick or a film maker who knows how to appeal to the marketplace like Steven Spielberg?  On the one hand there are Nolan's artistic films, Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002) and on the other hand there are his big screen commercial successes, this film and Batman Begins.  Knowing the constraints placed on film makers by the need to get funding and to turn a profit, it may be that he is trying to be both.  In fact perhaps the best way to look at The Prestige and Batman Begins is to recognize that they are artistic films made within industry constraints that require mass market appeal.very good as well.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Loved loved loved this version.   If you have to own Jane Eyre, this is IT!  The actors have such great chemistry and they make the passion between Jane and Mr. Rochester believable.  The BBC version completely lacked this, IMO.  The music is INCREDIBLE as is the cinematography.
1416914285|5.0|Though I love Ms. Clare's fannish work, my expectations for her first novel were a bit on the low side.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! (I actually finished it in the airport yesterday and instead of beginning the next book I had with me, I started rereading City of Bones instead.) Come to think of it, I actually should have expected this novel to tickle me as it did; it is, of course, right up my fannish alley. There are all manner of supernatural elements in a delightful hodge-podge and the characters are endlessly charming, witty, and fun, as I ought to have expected. I've always been a fan of Ms. Clare's style; she is funny, people! In this case, I really enjoyed the substance of the story, too. While not the most original thing I've ever read (it does borrow quite a bit from recognizable elements of the fantasy genre, but there are, after all, only seven plots in Hollywood), I really liked how she ran with what she had. I was entirely willing to suspend disbelief on her behalf. Seriously, I thought this was great and I can't wait for more. I really do like her work, original or not. Three cheers!
0151013047|1.0|I saw this book at a store and immediately started reading it. It was somewhat interesting but I hate the stop and start of the story of him in America and him and the stranger in the cafe. I stopped reading after page thirty. I will finish it someother day and tell you how I feel about the story. I have a feeling that he the character is a bad person and has something to do with the attacks.
075640407X|5.0|Absolutely riveting high-fantasy. Not only is the plot fascinating and well-conceived, the narration is deft and intriguing. This is \\"Harry Potter for grown-ups\\" on an even deeper level than Susanna Clarke's \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.\\" This is a brilliant story, brilliantly told. I cannot believe that I have to wait to learn the rest of the story; this is only part one of three. I am in awe. I will wait with breathless anticipation. <br /> <br />eee.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|...then you just may want to pass on this album. <br /> <br />\\"The Best Damn Thing,\\" by Avril Lavigne is, in short, just plain \\"bleh.\\"  I'm 22, so I've grown up alongside Lavigne--she and I were the same age when she released her debut, \\"Let Go.\\"  Her first album was good, and showed definite promise.  It was a tad superficial, but several of her songs proved she had a skill worth honing, which was more defined in her sophomoric album, \\"Under My Skin.\\"  The second album delved a little deeper in meaning with the lyrics, and it seemed as I was maturing with my taste in music, Avril would continue with me and produce more mature material. <br /> <br />\\"The Best Damn Thing\\" is NOT that.  While many of the songs are undoubtedly catchy and make you want to rapidly bob your head, they are vapid and shallow.  The rhyming in the songs is something an angsty thirteen year-old would write.  And while she constantly attempts to emphasize that she's not a pop-princess, her songs are more than a little reminiscent of high school cheerleader cheers (does no one remember that she originally wanted to be a country singer?).  When someone brags that they wrote a song when they were wasted (\\"Girlfriend\\"), that's not something that improves my confidence in their writing skills (I mean, come ON--\\"You make me wanna puke\\"?&lt;--lyric in \\"I Can Do Better\\"). <br /> <br />I know the talent's in there. I know she can do better than this waste of time and money.  My advice: download the few songs on iTunes that are actually decent on this album.  Those include: <br /> <br />--\\"Runaway\\" <br />--\\"When You're Gone\\" <br />--\\"Keep Holding On\\" <br /> <br />Maybe(s): <br /> <br />--\\"Hot\\" <br />--\\"Contagious\\" <br /> <br />If You Must (because it's on the radio): <br /> <br />--\\"Girlfriend\\" <br /> <br />And if you want to laugh at the ridiculous lyrics (namely the beginning): <br /> <br />--\\"I Don't Have to Try\\" <br /> <br />At least in her defense, she didn't spell the names of her songs in \\"I.M.\\" like Katharine McPhee's \\"Not Ur Girl.\\"  And, I must admit, this album is still better than Hilary Duff's \\"Dignity,\\" much, I'm sure, to Hilary's dissatisfaction and Avril's delight. <br /> <br />
B00000AOUD|5.0|Jethro Tull's fifth album, THICK AS A BRICK, is simply one of the best progressive rock concept albums of all time.<br /><br />In the wake of the band's widely renown and controversial fourth album, AQUALUNG, TAAB marks a pivotal change in Tull's/Ian Anderson's musical maturity - straying from the usual 3 and 4 min. songs to the epic masterpiece. This change in compositional style seems to have been first introduced by the band in the song MY GOD from AQUALUNG, and later revisited on the albums A PASSION PLAY and MINSTREL IN THE GALLERY.<br /><br />The music on TAAB features soft classical/folk melodies, intensely hard progressive rock rhythms & riffs, hauntingly magnificent organ & flute passages and thought-provoking lyrics that remarkably blend and contrast with each other in tandem.<br /><br />Though the first \\"song\\" (actually referred to as 'edit #1' - cut from the beginning of track 1) has been played frequently on the radio worldwide, the rest of the album rarely gets airtime due to its two, 20+ minute track lengths and intrinsic way of changing from one melody to the next without break.<br /><br />The album's concept exposes the varied ways in which mainstream society attempts to stifle creative thought in the young through constant conditioning so they will eventually become `thick as a brick', or `dumbed-down', to suit society's needs.  However, that train of thought gives a double meaning to the phrase 'thick as a brick' because, in doing so, society would be dumbing itself down, as well. I apologize as I could go on and on about the countless ways the album's title can be interpreted and still not fully explore what such a concept entails. That, I believe, is the very artistic conundrum this album presents to the listener.<br /><br />As with any concept album, TAAB's main idea is not only in its lyrics - though these are exceptionally powerful, vivid and often humorous. TAAB's concept is further supported by the hilarious mock newspaper on the album's jacket that headlines an article on Gerald \\"Little Milton\\" Bostock, age 8, winning first prize for his poem \\"Thick As A Brick\\" which is later disqualified for being too controversial while the award passes to another child's trite poem based on Christian ethics.<br /><br />The only negative I could possibly offer to a prospective buyer about the album is the aforementioned track length of which it has been heavily criticized. I'd like to further mention that it was apparently done on purpose to promote thinking \\"outside the box\\" of commonplace and commercialism, which again is this album's concept. Finally, if you enjoy progressive rock concept albums and don't have this one already, this is undoubtedly the album you've been looking to buy.album's jacket that headlines an article on Gerald \\"Little Milton\\" Bostock, age 8, winning first prize for his poem \\"Thick As A Brick\\" which is later disqualified for being too controversial while the award passes to another child's trite poem based on Christian ethics.  <br /> <br />The only negative I could possibly offer to a prospective buyer about the album is the aforementioned track length of which it has been heavily criticized.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|First, I don't think Edward Norton has made a bad film.  He definitely doesn't disappoint here either.  A very clever role for Paul Giamatti as well.<br /><br />This is the movie that The Prestige wanted to be.  With all its big name actors, I think it overshadowed The Illusionist just a bit.  The Prestige leaves us stunned thinking that magicians do possess supernatural powers, but that's not what we want to believe.  We're satisfied because the magicians gave away a few secrets, but not the ones we wanted them to.<br /><br />The Illusionist tricks us in much the same way, but doesn't create hype by going above and beyond the realm of real magic.  We are still stunned, but we are still told it's only a trick.  We believe in it.<br /><br />Beautiful cinema.  Superb acting. Excellent music score.  And excellently paced as well.  I wasn't bored.  With The Prestige, I felt like they could have trimmed it a little without taking away from the film, but it was still distracting.<br /><br />The Illusionist grabs your full attention and doesn't let go.  We get a good show, and enough of it that leaves you wanting more.  Just as a magic show should be!  A good illusion!
006112429X|5.0|Ms. Shriver has written a story so compelling with three-dimensional characters that breathe from the page in all their vibrancy.  Starting the book, the reader may feel that since the ending is known, there isn't anything to learn, but that is just a superficial approach as this book examines a horrorific event from many angles, revealing facts and insights so skillfully, that each page resonates with meaning.  It is impossible to put down, impossible to forget, and most importantly, impossible to skim.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|First off, this is a good play all the way through. It flows just the way you want it to. I had heard alot about Arcade Fire, but that was about it. I had never heard any of their tunes. So many people had ranted and raved about Funeral but it never compelled me enough to give it a listen. Yesterday my buddy drops Neon Bible on my desk thinking that I will like it. I cant stop listening to it. I had my favorites at first, but now it's all starting to grow on me. You can hear so many different influences in their sound, but their orginality remains in tact. Keep the Car running has some traces of \\"The Boss\\". Also, I find similarities between them and the new pornographers. I find this record fresh and inspiring. A definate contender for my best album of the year.
B000J233SK|5.0|What I really want to say about this remarkable artist, cannot be expressed in words. Its like trying to describe the taste of a perfect mango, you have to experience it - to KNOW.<br /><br />I do know that listening to Loreena and her \\"Highwaymen\\" accompanists, is like entering into another world.  Her's is the music and words of our ancestors, the deeds, loves, sorrows and joys of living on this planet in another time, in the celtic spirit, carried on the wings of divine music.<br /><br />She is Canadian, but she sings these verses like she's a Celtic angel, sent to us to help us remember where we came from, and how far we've traveled.  Buy this or any of her works if you yearn for an escape from the present, live in another time, in a place, when we were free and owed allegience to no king, only to the heartbeat of Nature, the rhythm of existance.<br /><br />Last night I put track 8, Dante's prayer, on repeat, so I could stay in the trance it invokes for a long time.  Do you know what its like to be truly moved by an artist?  Moved to tears, to joy, to a state of emotional surrender?  Do the same with track 3, Skellig.  I swear, I could feel the rocks under my old sandels, and the weariness of the journey from the rocky shores of Ireland to the fields of Romanie, stopping along the way to hear the bells - who call all to mass.<br /><br />This music will make you appreciate a good set of head phones again, like the Sony MDR7502's.  Find the time to hear this music, its transforming.
0064431789|5.0|I remember loving this book as a child.  I bought if for my son and he loves it as much as I do.  We read it every night before bed picking out our favorite \\"wild things\\" and dancing with them!  Very good book!
B000MXPE7O|3.0|I had heard mixed reviews about this film, but finally decided to check it out. It is an iteresting piece about the beginning of the CIA and the conflicts early on in the cold war. The movie is a reflection of an agents life from his beginning in the military intelligence in WWII to him signing on with the CIA.  Its done in a number of flashback, and the main film is taking place after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba back in mid april 1961.  A lot of stories to try and pick up on, lots of double crossing plots etc, but in the end I was left dissappointed. I thought the plot gave itself up earlier than expected, and then the movie just kinda ended, just fizzling out. It was a long film 2 H 49 min, and I think at the end of the film some big things happened, but just got drug out as the rest of the film did.  Just to long, lost its pizazz, and really wattered down what could have been great.  Could have been condensed to about 2 hours and still been good. Worth watching if you like a little mystery and suspense, as well as a look at that period in history, one which I was happy to see a portrayal of and lead me to do and sparked me to do a little reseach in history.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|oh, i get it.  this is one of those heavy Led Zep, Black Sab influenced bands that indie listeners can talk about.  no better than The Datsuns, and they sound too much like the White Stripes.  i'm not saying they're bad, but five stars?  please...
B00006CXSS|5.0|Simply the best DVDs I have ever bought. Compelling and at times emotioanl viewing. Makes me realise what a privliged life we now have compared to many of those who came before us.
B000MCIBAW|4.0|As with the new issue of L.A. Woman I recently purchased the sound on Strange Days is phenominal.  This should be an example of how re-releases should be handled.  We, as customers, shouldn't settle for anything less. <br /> <br />Pros:  The clarity of all the instruments is amazing.  I can't say enough about the sound.  I don't have a problem with the album being remixed because I think it's done for the better.  The remixes are subltle enough to the casual fan that they probably won't even notice. <br /> <br />Cons:  My only beef is there really aren't any \\"bonus\\" tracks on here.  A live track or two would have been nice.
0688152023|5.0|OK, I studied dance for a REALLY long time, so your mileage may vary.  That said, when this book found its way to me, I was very out of shape.  I'd stopped dancing about 5 years ago and during that time my body just completely fell apart: carpal tunnel, joint pain, and a lot of extra weight found a way to sneak up on me.  I went back to take a ballet class and thought my feet were going to fall off, it was that hard to get back into it.  I figured I was doomed to be an ordinary, unfit American forever.  After two weeks of doing this workout, though, my knees don't hurt anymore and there's a lot more I can do.  A smaller waist and more defined shoulders, arms, and legs were just an added bonus!<br /><br />I think anyone, dancer or not, can benefit from doing the exercises here.  You will not lose 30 pounds in 30 days, but you might end up looking as though you had!
B00005NP04|4.0|For someone who isn't even much of a modern country-music fan, I was just blown away by the sheer artistry and song choice on this incredible Greatest Hits Compilation.<br /><br />You know, Greatest Hits compilations are tricky things, because, as you may have personally experienced, they can sometimes be surprisingly bland and weak (Shania Twain's compilation for instance - why exactly was that album so boring), or unexpected gifts (like both of Tim McGraw's Hits Compilations - who knew he had such quality work under his belt?).<br /><br />Martina's Greatest Hits CD falls firmly into the category of `classic'. I mean, theres just no other way to describe it. Granted, that rare `Hope Floats' track isn't there (and what a track that was!) but every other one of her amazing hits is here, alongwith 4 quality new tracks (though they DO pale in the face of her more critically successful work). The best songs here are of course \\"I Love You\\" and the incomparable \\"Independence Day\\".<br /><br />The only `commercial' track here is \\"Valentine\\" with Jim Brickman (never can stand that song for some reason - too sappy), but this is all made up for by the other great torch songs Martina has sung.<br /><br />Martina is more of a country vocalist than a country singer, which is why I guess the album is heavier on the slower songs. But not to worry, every song is a gem, and I whole-heartedly recommend this album to everyone, even if you're NOT a country fan.<br /><br />This is the perfect road trip album. One of the few CDs you can play all the way through. I have it on my Itunes and its about the second or third album I've ever played all the way through without skipping tracks. Commendable!
B00082IJ08|5.0|I'm an older 80's& 90's music lover and buy very little of todays stuff,but this got me.\\"Dare\\" is just too funky,the rest of this disc is alright too.Adult content aside.Not overtly offensive.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Mustaine is a excellent guitar player and this cd has amazing riffs. The problem with the cd is the vocals. Mustaine has never really been my faviorte singer but still enjoy the music.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainright is shamefully ignored by the \\"mainstream\\" thats they're loss...POP possibly..but the level of his music goes beyond complex,with extremely clever lyrics.Discovering his music has been one of most enjoyable musical journeys I've had. Yes he's gay get over it and give a listen.You might open your mind and heart a bit.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|I'm not exactly sure why, but I hate to admit I liked this movie.  It was blood, guts and gore at its very best.  Halloween sets the standard in horror, as far as I'm concerned, and this is in no way on par with that movie, but it kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat.  It's a simple plot filled with a lot of elaborate killings scenes.  I liked it enough to rent two and three, and if a Saw four comes out, I'll rent it to.  If you like horror with gore, you can't miss this movie.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Get it. No need for detailed reviews. You won't regret it. The best in my collection. Not only is it jam packed with all Rod's hits but it's a fun and sexy concert.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I rarely do this but this great film has moved me so much that I feel I want to spread the word...this film is truly amazing in every sense of the word..the acting, the historical story, the cinematography is such that I felt like I was actually there, and most especially the actors particularly Renee Zelwegger and Jude Law were simply superb...this is my second time to watch Jude Law in a film (after loving the Holiday I chose COld Mountain)and I can really say that he is one of the finest young actors that we have today...his extraordinary range is unbelievable and looking at all the films that he has done in his still young age of 34, I can see that he will really be acclaimed as one of the best actors of our time...his perfromance in Cold Mountain was almost like he was doing Shakespeare and with his matching physical beauty, it nearly gave me chills....kudos to the director too and I am just waiting for the next Mingella movie Breaking and Entering to come out in dvd...I heard its simply awesome and stars Jude Law and Ju;liet Binoche.... <br />C Mountain is one movie that I will cherish and will be watching again and again....
B000BUKHTS|5.0|I read this book about 10 years ago with my previous book club. I had a hard time following it.  This time around, I enjoyed it.  It is hard to follow, but if you split the names up.  And think what they did, it may help. <br />The story is about mother's and daughter's relationships.  Mostly, the asian mother's being able to relate to their daughter's which they did not seem to do well.  The mother's did not understand them and the daughter's did not understand their mother. I would recommend this for anyone who has a book club.
0226264211|3.0|but he was well regarded by the wonderful folks at the Ivy League schools. I would have given 4 stars but he spent his latter years on the webite of that unpatriotic lunatic Michael W Hodges.<br /><br />Verdict: a little too hippie
B000MNP2KI|2.0|There are a couple of good elements in this movie: Daniel Craig is very close to Ian Fleming's original character (a bit reminiscent of the very good Timothy Dalton on that count) and two action scenes (in Africa and Venice) are simply stunning. But the script is plain silly and the second James Bond girl is ugly and utterly unconvincing in her role. Also the script voluntarily demolishes quite a few established pillars of the James Bond franchise, meaning that in the end this movie is not really a \\"James Bond movie\\" in my view. Put simply, I strongly recommend avoiding this movie if you are a James Bond fan. If you are not and if you like skinny brunettes with a fox-like face, you might like it.
B000O178BY|5.0|Ok, so I got my copy of this album yesterday, and I think I've already worn the bottom off of it. From 1989 to 2004, Trent Reznor lived a life of pure torment - drugs, alcohol, depression, and social anxiety disorder were dictating his life. Music was his only therapy, and even that didn't get his life back together. So, one day he stopped taking drugs and alcohol, he just stopped. Soon he realized that he didn't need those things to write songs, only to make him feel better about himself. He felt more comfortable around people and started feeling better about himself. When With Teeth came out, he wrote about the changes and feelings he had during the 6 years after The Fragile was released. Then he embarked on the tour for that album, more confident than ever before.<br /><br />So what, after writing about your misery for years and years, write about after you've become clean, sober, and happy. Trent found out what: the thinks around you. Year Zero is a concept album that depicts a dystopia about 15 years in the future. You're either really rich or really poor in this new world. The country is still fighting in the war against Iraq, and people are starting to lose the will to decide for themselves. Each song is told from a different point of view. You can tell that these people are sick of this world and sick of the corporate thugs that are running America. This is also the first NIN album to feature instrumentals (which are Hyperpower! and Another Version of the Truth) since The Fragile.<br /><br />There are lots of great tracks here. My favorites would have to be these: The Beginning of the End, which is someone talking about how the America has become a dog-eat-dog country, and you're either left behind or you fight on. Vessel has a very fun and funky chorus which could do great as a single. This song is told by a person who can see through the media and the movements by George W. Bush and has become his own God. Capital G is told from two different views. The first one is told from a man who is angry at Bush for declaring war on Iraq and the majority of the population for electing him into office. He sees himself as weak and helpless, and can't do anything to help the country. The second is told from a man - perhaps Bush - who is living the big life and couldn't care less about what's going on with the rest of the world (\\"Don't give a s**t about the temperature in Guatemala\\"). He also s thinks that everyone is mad only because he's better of than them (\\"You only wish you were in my position\\"). The Warning has a very cool bassline and relaxed atmosphere. The lyrics are especially interesting. They talk about an alien life form that comes down from the sky (which could be the 4-fingered giant hand on the cover), which tells the world that they have been observing us, and how we foolishly use violence to solve our problems. We've become a poison to the solar system, and they will destroy the world if we don't change our ways. Meet Your Master is about the government once again pushing down the minority and forcing false information down their throats. They try to make it sound like they are the reasons America has lost its ways (\\"You've left quite a mess here\\"). And the last track, Zero-Sum, is an excellent, quiet piano closer. The lyrics, with the exception of the chorus, are spoken, rather than sung, but it works out for the album. In my eyes, it seems to be about the rich and privileged in the dystopia realizing that they've been going down the wrong path, but they didn't care and just continued to go the way America was going. So, they need to change their ways or be destroyed.<br /><br />On the back of the album is a joke sticker that reads:<br /><br />\\"USBM WARNING:<br /><br />Consuming or spreading this material may be deemed subversive by the United States Bureau of Morality. If you or someone you know has engaged in subversive acts or thoughts, call:<br /><br />1-866-445-6580<br /><br />BE A PATRIOT - BE AN INFORMER!\\"<br /><br />This is obviously a play on the \\"FBI Anti Privacy Warning\\" label that is slapped on countless CDs (including this one). I think this was a brilliant idea for Trent to do, and very funny as well.<br /><br />On the back of the album is a pretty good representation of what this future world looks like: On one side is a picture perfect neighborhood with clean streets, nice houses, big building, and a church. A big wall separates just a few feet it from the ghetto city that is crowded with dilapidated buildings and smog from smokestacks casting blackness over the sky. Like I said, these aren't separated from being on a different page. They're separated from a wall which shows how corrupt America has become.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Year Zero is told pessimistically. I'd say it's basically Trent expressing his concerns with the directions America is going. And with George W. Bush running the country, an album like this was absolutely necessary to make. Even though I've only owned this album for 2 days, this is easily one of my favorite NIN albums. I hope Trent realizes what he's made here, as Year Zero is truly a fantastic album. This is easily the best album of 2007 in my opinion, even though it's only April. And even though I love With Teeth and I think it's a severely underrated album (not by means of sales but from half of Trent's fans trashing it), there is no doubt in my mind that Year Zero is far superior. In fact, listening to this album somewhat lowers my opinion of With Teeth, now that I know that Trent could do better in his clean and sober state.<br /><br />You're wasting your time if you're a NIN fan and don't already own this record. Trust me, it's that good.<br /><br />P.S. There's a small rumor going around that Trent may have a movie made of Year Zero. Can anyone clarify whether this is true or not?A PATRIOT - BE AN INFORMER!\\"  <br />  <br />This is obviously a play on the \\"FBI Anti Privacy Warning\\" label that is slapped on countless CDs (including this one).

B000JSI7AI|5.0|I've watched this film 4 times now, and the curious thing is that each time I view it, it gets better.  This film is a classic, a breakthrough.  Everything about it is perfection.  It is a perfect example of \\"less is more.\\"  The acting is excellent, the cinematography, brilliant.  The script, heartbreaking.  In my thinking, it WAS the best picture of the year.  This film will be one that is owned in collections of the best films of all times.  It's in mine, and I hope that it will be in yours.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Turner Pictures' \\"Gettysburg\\" is the lengthy but fascinating dramatization of Michael Shaara's classic Civil War novel \\"The Killer Angels.\\"  At mini-series length and populated with an army's worth of solid actors, \\"Gettysburg\\" delivers the gripping story of the three-day battle as experienced by some of the key personalities.<br /><br />Among the highpoints:<br /><br />Sam Elliot as hardbitten Union Cavalry General John Buford, who recognized the value of the terrain at Gettysburg and whose decision to stand there helps bring on the battle.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels is absolutely superb as Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, a professor at Bowdoin College become a leader of men at war.  Jeff Daniels manages to capture both the intelligence and the determination that won Chamberlain a Medal of Honor in the desperate struggle for the end of the Union line at Little Round Top.<br /><br />Tom Berenger gives a nuanced and conflicted performance as Confederate General Longstreet, Lee's most reliable Corps Commander, who advises Lee against the Battle at Gettysburg and who must overcome his better instincts to execute Lee's orders.<br /><br />Martin Sheen does his best to deliver as Confederate General Robert E. Lee, but only just fails to capture the charisma and the hidden steel that made Lee such a deadly and successful battlefield commander for so long.  Perhaps the best of his performance  in this movie is his meeting with his missing cavalry commander, J.E.B. Stuart, after the second day of battle.<br /><br />The movie was filmed over the actual ground at Gettysburg using properly equipped re-enactors who add much authenticity to the battle scenes.  The sharp-eyed viewer will enjoy picking out a number of actors hiding behind more or less authentic period whiskers.  The magnificent score adds to the appreciation of what was at stake at Gettysburg, while the prologue and epilogue provide a haunting sense of the harsh fates awaiting many of the key players in the battle.<br /><br />This movie is most highly recommended to fans of the Civil War who are prepared to overlook some TV-movie production shortfalls for an entertaining and educational dramatization of the Civil War's most fateful battle.s most highly recommended to fans of the Civil War who are prepared to overlook some TV-movie production shortfalls for an entertaining and educational dramatization of the Civil War's most fateful battle.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I totally agree with all of the others. This Seagal movie was a total waste of anything consumed to produce or effort to buy it. It is one of those films (can not really be called a movie)that they would have to pay me a lot of money to sit thru and watch it. Deemed so bad, it could be classed as inhumane to use on POWs. So far off the mark, I am shocked he would put his name (let alone act) on it. So far from the Under Siege 1 and 2, I would be ashamed to claim I purchased it, let alone watched this over dubbed, darkly shot, plottless film.
B000ASATWQ|3.0|I don't know how all of you can praise this album, comparing Damian to Bob.  No artist will ever come close to Bob's talents and emotions.  This is not reggae.  It's good dancehall and rap inspired music with energy, but you simply can't compare this work to ANYTHING Bob Marley ever created.
B000005YZM|5.0|I know how bold a statement that is, and I don't take it lightly.  But the whole thing is a song cycle about the death of a relationship, rebuilding after the breakup, and that moment where you're ready to get back into the game.  \\"A Rose for Emily\\" is a gorgeous piece of piano-pop, and few genius tunes are as distinctly British as \\"Maybe After He's Gone.\\"  You all probably know \\"Time of the Season\\" from its incessant play on oldies radio; but it doesn't really make as much sense out-of-context, without the lead-in of the weird but happy \\"Friends of Mine.\\" <br /> <br />And that's just the tip of the iceberg with this record.  Shifts in mood are frequent, just like the ups and downs of being on the receiving end of a really bad dumping.  \\"Brief Candles\\" details what everybody goes through, trying to convince themselves that things WILL get better with time, that the wounds of the broken heart will heal given enough time.  Really, it's the Zombies' version of the classic Beatles tune \\"For No One.\\"  That song, off the Beatles' masterpiece Revolver, is a gorgeous, heart-wrenching tune that will break anyone's heart; and the Zombies somehow best it. <br /> <br />But the most amazing track of them all comes smack-dab in the middle of the B-side: \\"This Will Be Our Year.\\"  With a stunning, almost blue-eyed soulful vocal performance by Colin Blunstone (back when he could still sing), the song packs the most hope possible into two minutes.  Simple lyrics abound, but sometimes, simple lyrics are the most profound: \\"I won't forget the way you said / Darling I love you / You gave me faith to go on / Now we're there / And we've only just begun.\\"  And if you don't get goosebumps when Blunstone's voice cracks slightly as he sings, \\"The warmth of your smile / Smile for me, little one,\\" you just don't like heartfelt music.
B000J3EEBY|1.0|Evidently there is some kind of copy protection on her cds that make it near impossible to play them on your computer CD-ROM drive.All you get is a connection to her website where they advise you to right click on the drive and then click run. WRONG. Just takes you to her website and seemingly impossible to get the CD to play. I am furious at wasting money like this.
B000FZETKC|5.0|A must have if you grew up in the 80's, or even if your growing up now. Eric Stoltz shines in this performance of quiet strength. The soundtrack is a phenomenal collection of quintessential 80's NEW WAVE. One of the best coming of age movies ever. An absolute five star \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\".
B0007O38F8|1.0|YOU  KNOW  WE  ALL  SAY  WHY  ARE  TEENAGERS  THE  WAY  THEY  ARE....  WELL  THIS  CD  IS  A  PRIME  EXAMPLE.  IT  TALKS  ABOUT  GUNS,   DRUGS,  MURDER,  SEX,  EVERYTHING  I  WOULD  KEEP  MY  KID  AWAY  FROM.  I  THINK  THERE  SHOULD  BE  A  LAW  AGAINST  SAYING  WHAT  YOU  WANT  IN  MUSIC.  IT  JUST  GETS  OUT  OF  CONTROL.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I had the same experience with opening the CD and THEN noticing it was edited, no labels in sight. A friend of mine bought the CD/DVD combo version and says the unedited CD is in that. Ummm... no. I'm not buying it twice.
B000OCXF0Q|2.0|I have one of the most eclectic CD collections of anyone I know. My musical tastes run the gambit from Tchaikovsky to Opeth and everything in between. I mention that just so you know that I can truly appreciate many different styles of music. I am a really big fan of Avril's first two albums and found myself really looking forward to her third offering. After hearing \\"Keep Holding On\\" and \\"Girlfriend\\" I believed Avril was well on her way to brining another fine album to her fans. How wrong I was. Though Avril has aged several years since her debut album, this album, by far, feels the most juvenile.  If you listen to all three of her albums back to back to back, most people would say that \\"Under My Skin\\" is her best and \\"Let Go\\" is an immediate second. If you fall into that camp, then you will most likely agree with this album review. On a scale of 1-10, I would give this album a weak 5. If you were to remove \\"Keep Holding On\\" it would score lower. Solid rock tunes like \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Forgotten\\" are nowhere to be found on this album. It leans more toward the pop genre with lots of \\"boom-clack-boom\\" rhythms and cheerleading-type chants. Ironic considering how much she swears on the album. For die-hard fans, give it a try and see what you think. I'm betting you'll agree with me.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I give this movie five stars for the action (combat) scenes, which truly are amazing. Like being in a documentary of urban combat. The director didn't \\"cut away\\" either, but the shot gets strung along in a really amazing way (how many takes did they do, or was it more or less \\"improv\\" ?).  <br /> <br />I was willing to go along with the societal/political \\"critique\\" or point of view of the movie. I mean, it is fictional and you have to suspend judgment for it to work. But on the other hand, when the bad guys (who are portrayed as \\"fascists\\" and wear black) are represented as \\"Homeland Security\\", I thought, \\"ok. Detour, now we are back in 2007 and no longer in science fiction territory\\". The more or less good guys in this film are portrayed as the sort of \\"open borders\\", pot smoking, \\"multi-cultural\\" guys, and the bad guys are almost all blonde and blue-eyed, and believe in closing the border. In other words, the good guys are \\"progressive\\" liberals, and the bad guys are the Tories (conservatives).  <br /> <br />Maybe I am being a bit too literal here. I am sure someone will log on and go \\"but it is science fiction, chill out !!\\". I was willing to go with the flow, up to that \\"Homeland Security\\" sign. I found myself thinking of that discussion in the editing room. The director says something like \\"I think that is just a bit TOO direct an attack on Bush, don't you think ?\\". And then the other people convince him to \\"follow his conviction\\" and put it in. Whenever you start thinking like that, the film has a problem.
0743454537|3.0|A very interesting and complex issue, very slow in the middle (why was there so much detail given to the relationship between the guardian and the lawyer?  It added nothing to the overall story and was just a distraction from the topic at hand) but not a bad book overall.  The biggest issue I had with this book was the ending.  It think it was supposed to be irony or maybe shock, but it was really just overly simplistic and very unrealistic.
B000O178BY|5.0|This album has surpassed all my wants, needs, and expectations of what I wanted in a new NIN album!  There are no fillers in this album at all and it is an incredible concept album from the very beginning to the end!  It's straight to the point, hard edged, boundary pushing, very damn catchy, sonically driven, craft-fully written, and once again completely brilliant NIN!  This album will really please people that love the Broken and The Downward Spiral albums because of its edginess and cutting sound scapes.  Tracks like \\"Vessel,\\" \\"The Warning,\\" and \\"The Great Destroyer\\" will put old Downward Spiral loving NIN fans at ease with how much it feels like being back in the year 1994 when one of the greatest, ground breaking albums of all time was released.  It really does have that Downward Spiral and Broken feel to it because the album is so improvised, harsh - but beautiful, sonically pushed to the limit, and not written for the faint of heart.  This is classic Trent at his best!     <br /> <br />Overall this album gets a 10 in my book!  Why a 10 you might ask?  Because every song on this album is amazing and they could all sit on their own without a story behind it.  In this day and age it's really hard to find an album that you love from beginning-to-end, but with Year Zero I've found it!  In my opinion this is an absolute must buy for old and new NIN fans.  I believe once you strap this beast of an album in you will say to yourself, \\"Yeah, this is why I love NIN!\\"   <br /> <br />Thank you so much Trent for this masterpiece!!! <br />
1569242739|4.0|I am a raw vegan for health reasons.  That means I eat raw plant food in its natural state.  My family eats more of a healthy but wildcard cooked diet, and when I made \\"Your Basic Chocolate Cupcake\\" with \\"Vegan Fluffy Buttercream Frosting\\" sprinkled with some candy cane powder we had leftover from the holidays it was a hit.<br /><br />The cupcakes did get a bit mangled and sank, probably due to being cooked at over 7,000 ft. above sea level.  This is something I have to work out on my own though, and is not at all a problem with the recipe itself.<br /><br />Soon I will have to return this book to the library but I put it on my wish list as I enjoy having a resource to make dairy and egg free treats for the family, instead of buying them conventional sweets and desserts.<br /><br />The reason why I did give this book 4 stars is 2 cupcake pictures kept repeating themselves.  The pictures that are provided are so awesome, that I only wish instead of the same cupcake pictures shown 5-6 times throughout the book, that one of the unpictured recipes would have been represented.

B000J4OYRW|5.0|Usually I have no patience for documenaries but I enjoyed watching this one, maybe because the content is so relevant - the band, after all, is still making fantastic music. As if to prove that, the DVD bonus features include recent videos along some old rare TV perfomances. One can think the Pet Shop Boys have issued enough DVDs and interviews, but this is actually their first complete biographic documentary which traces their career from school days to Potemkin's premiere.<br /><br />The narration goes through candid interviews or rather edited monologues of Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant filmed together and separately (watch Lowe walking on the gloomy beach in his hometown, Tennant's silhouette as London is fading away in the twilight behind the window). It's quite intriguing to see them talk about the essence of their distinctive image, music and career nuances. The timeline is supported, throughout the film, by extracts of their videos and various TV footage. Plus, as usually, you have a little variety of guests: Brandon Flowers of The Killers, Robbie Williams, Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters, Trevor Horn and others.<br /><br />The only inconsistency I find is that after the Behaviour era the documentary speeds up its pace and Bilingual, Nighlife (especially) and Release periods are barely covered.<br /><br />In a way the DVD audiovisually duplicates 'Pet Shop Boys Catalogue', a massive book by Chris Heath.
B00005JPLU|3.0|Hold \\"300\\" up to the light and you can see right through it's glorious, silk-screened surface to the empty glow behind.  Ostensibly \\"about\\" a group of Spartans who dare to be the only true force of resistance against a mind-bogglingly huge Persian army, this film is really only about the harsh, sandy images that make up each of its flickering seconds.<br /><br />Why fret about political imperatives?  The only \\"message\\" you'll find here is the one you send up from your own mind to float along with the projector's high-beam.  Why read into its bloody contours and mythic dialogue notes of racism and homophobia?  The only prejudices that wink back from the characters are the ones you feel ready to expect.  \\"300\\" is, indeed, a beautifully rendered film, but much like the planes of the most gorgeous mirror, the only substance you will find to look at is the reflection of your own ideologies and assumptions.<br /><br />Okay, so I'm waxing prosaic on a movie that already has enough lush pastoral glitter.  It's hard to do much more, though.  This film is \\"about\\" the Battle of Thermopylae, and its plot boasts battle twists, betrayal, political intrigue, corruption, and self-sacrifice, but these elements are hasty and almost derivative when you compare them to the astonishing visuals they are meant to impel.<br /><br />After all, we're talking about a group of men who -- for some reason -- feel compelled to fight in fat, red robes, shin guards, helmets, and leather thongs.  And that's it.  Their odd battle accoutrements are the REAL icons of their bravery.  (Of course, if they'd opted for breastplates, we wouldn't be treated to the vales of scultped pecs and abs these actors worked so hard to build.)  It's just one more hint that what this is about is not why these men fight, but that they fight at all, and look good doing it.<br /><br />And, don't be confused, the movie looks good.  Hell, it looks fantastic.  Every panel of Miller's graphic novel (don't you dare call it a comic book) is exquisitely and excruciatingly rendered in detail so fine that you can feel it slipping like splinters into each rod and cone of your retina.  I was, in fact, tempted to give it five stars simply for its sumptuousness.<br /><br />But it's a bit too happy to be nothing more than an exercise in pretty violence and wicked-n-wild wonderment.  When the 300 men walked with jaws clenched out of the canyons to a you-gotta-be-kidding-me heavy metal guitar riff, I snorted Coca-Cola out of my nose.  The movie was \\"cool\\" enough before it pandered to its first-person, blood-hungry audience with a video game soundtrack.  And then it flips around and tries to be sincere, showing us a lonely wife with her too-cute son standing in waving amber fields.  She looks moodily out to the vanishing distance, and suddenly the theatre is filled with a crooning, Enya-esque musical score.  More soda shot from my nostrils.<br /><br />Filmic fromage aside, I still would've given the movie four stars for its virtuoso imagery, if it weren't for the horribly weak plug-ins that serve as the flick's only real source of story.  The movie flickers from battle scenes to scenes back at Sparta, where King Leonidas' wife, Gorgo, struggles to squeeze support from the Spartan council members.  Not only are these scenes unnecessary (completely unnecessary, I tell you), and not only do they contribute nothing to the plot (absolutely nothing, I say), but they are also unbelievable (truly and totally unbelievable).  Most of these scenes do not appear in Miller's graphic novel, and for good reason.  They serve here not just as fissures in the energy and heart of the piece, but also as eye-rolling attempts to reflect in Gorgo's gorgeous eyes and body a courage at least as powerful as that of her hunky hubby.  It doesn't work.  Boy howdy, does it not work.<br /><br />(Also unbelievable -- at one point, one of the Spartans utters the following line: \\"I never got a chance to tell him I loved him.\\"  No fooling!)<br /><br />Forgiven, I say.  Because all I expected were astonishing battle sequences, vistas painted with adrenaline, acid, and ambition.  Those things are there, in stunning quantity and quality.  But let's not pretend there are deeper currents here.  Let's not pretend anyone will learn anything from \\"300.\\"  Just like the fighters of the title, this movie looks good, but it has not much in the way of brains, and if you look closely enough, you can see the celluloid behind its bloody BVDs.d him.\\"  No fooling!) <br /> <br />Forgiven, I say.

0195067142|5.0|The best actual battlefield account I've ever read. Arrogantly called the best account `by an enlisted man' on the back cover reviews Sledge's account transcends any attempt to classify it, in my opinion. Haunting, the reader will probably have night and day mares like those who fought in the battles Sledge describes so graphically.<br /><br />I was traveling around the Eastern Sierras last fall and used a Laundromat in Big Pine, CA. I noticed a USMC flag in the corner and engaged an unlikely short, spare old man around the place if he were a `Gyrene'. He was. I asked him about his war experiences and he told me he had been a 1st Marine Division Scout on Peleliu and Okinawa, had been wounded and spent 2 YEARS IN THE HOSPITAL UPON HIS RETURN. I immediately recognized him as being one of America's Greatest Generation and I thanked him for serving - I said it to him several times as it did not seem to be registering. Bob did assert Sledge wasn't actually one of the `Old Breed' as he had not served in the Cape Gloucester battle but I pointed out his title was `With the Old Breed' and that calmed Bob down.<br /><br />I bought and read the Sledge book a few weeks ago and drifted by the Laundromat and looked up Bob. I gave him the book. It brought tears to his eyes to see it and I showed him the list of the very few who had survived in Sledge's company. Bob said he was sure he knew several of them and said he might get a hold of Sledge himself through the 1st Marine Division Association. Bob went to his place and got out his hard bound copy of `The Old Breed' from which Sledge's work is named. Bob said he would get a new pair of reading glasses. I will drift by in a few weeks and he hasn't I'll offer to read Sledge to him.<br /><br />an excerpt from my continuing adventure journal<br />5/29/2007 9:34 Memorial Day - Or an exercise in applied ontology....<br /><br />I'm at `the office' now, my friend Chris's garage in Big Pine with my computer set up on her workbench, sitting on an old box, surrounded by dogs and cats who I have to guard against walking on my keyboard looking for pets while I'm typing. Not wanting to go in the house to use the potty I grab the mountain bike off the wall and cycle down to the Mobil station. While there I thought I'd cycle by Bob's and thank him for serving in WW 2. He was out on the sidewalk in his electric chair with the US and Marine Corps flags on the back sticking up over his oxygen bottle. I asked him what he was doing and he said, \\"Oh, just watching the world go by\\" as heavy southbound Memorial Day traffic passed. I said to Bob, \\"Happy Memorial Day, Bob. Thank you for serving in World War 2.\\" Tears welled up in his eyes and he just said thank you. I asked Bob if he had gotten any reading glasses yet so he could read the book I gave him but he said no. He was due to get a ride down to the VA hospital in Long Beach in a while where they would make some up for him. He told me of another Marine buddy of his who had died recently who was 83. I said to Bob, \\"Well, we're all getting older you know.\\"<br /><br />update - Veteran's Day 11/12/2007 I stopped by to see Bob yesterday after camping in the desert nearby. I flagged him down on his electric chair with the oxygen bottle on back flanked by the US and Marine Corp flags which flutter patriotically in the breeze when Bob is on the roll. I had my new girlfriend from LA with me and we thanked Bob for serving and making our current freedom and prosperity possible. When asked about `The War' - the Ken Burns series - Bob liked it but pointed out two errors - the two lines of Marines walking toward each other was from Tarawa not Okinawa and one other shot had also been mis-captioned.<br /><br />Carolyn asked Bob if he and his compatriots got together for reunions - Bob replied \\"there's no one left.\\" Like most of the `Old Breed' Marines Bob is tough. After moving to California in his 60s or so Bob pretty much lived in the backcountry of the Sierras - both by choice and necessity. He got a Pacemaker some time ago and went backpacking again and the pack straps wrecked the Pacemaker so Bob had to make an emergency trip to Long Beach to get another one.<br /><br />Now 83 Bob said he will be spending 3 months sometime this winter '07-`08 at the Long Beach VA to have his rotator cuff worked on.

B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor comes back with a new cd. Much darker and better produced than 'With Teeth'. Will take more listens to fully appreciate im sure, but it is definately a winner. I knew it would be better but not this much better. A much more intricate cd and full of sounds and hooks that stick to the mind.<br />Its sort of reminiscent of 'The Fragile' in terms of listening to it in its entirety. But it doesnt drag like Fragile did even though it clocks in at over an hour..<br />Really a great CD for old and New fans. Will be one of my year end favorites im sure.. Buy it.

I watch the DVD about every six months or so.  What can one say about Duval?  His performance is the best he's ever done and puts him on my list of top five actors of all time.  He's even said that this role was his finest.  My only regret was that this was a TV mini series and not eligible for Oscar consideration.  If it had been Duval would have walked off the stage with his second Best Actor statue.  Please do not miss this.

Your thoughts create your reality. Two cautions, however, put The Secret in perspective: First, you don't change the Universe by wishing for impossible outcomes, you only strain your own faith. And second, if you put \\"God\\" and \\"Faith\\" in place of \\"the universe\\" and \\"Want,\\" you'll see what the real secret is about.
B000093BDX|4.0|I agree with those who have the same gripe I do regarding this fantastic music continually re-issued with some of the songs in mono rather than the re-mastered ((stereo)) versions which ARE available.  Some may wonder exactly why at a time when stereo recording was well beyond its infancy anything was recorded in mono...the answer is actually a simple one: Brian Wilson was deaf in one ear and couldn't HEAR in stereo, and therefore concentrated on all other aspects of producing rather than on the stereo quality.  Again, it almost sounds too strange to be true, but that's the fact, Jack.<br /><br />Since then Brian has gone and personally overseen the re-mastering of all the music recorded in mono to fantastic quality stereo.  Other than the mono problem, Brian was a musical prodigy and a musical producer without peer.  When he wrote music he could *hear* the music in his head as it should sound in harmony before he put the notes on paper.  It takes a special kind of genius that can pull that off.  The result is a collection from the early 60's through their final hit in '88 (Kokomo) that is arguably one of the greatest in the entire rock era.  Off the top of my head I honestly cannot think of a song that wasn't included that really ought to have been.  My personal favorite of all is \\"The Sloop John B\\" and while I cannot tell you exactly why, it just brings back a whole slew of great memories for me.<br /><br />What the Beach Boys music I believe does better than just about everyone else is it gives us the taste of Summer we remember from so long ago, and for the most part, the music reminds us of the good times (at least it does for me).  For a long time it seemed as though the Beach Boys were much like the Stones in that they would carry on forever, but unfortunately things didn't work out that way.  Fractures in the band with some of the original members have created a break-up that isn't likely to be mended anytime soon, which is sad indeed.<br /><br />While I await for this collection to be re-issued entirely in stereo, what makes this edition entirely acceptable is the fact that for the vast majority, most of these songs were heard in mono to begin with, so its difficult to judge how much better they COULD be unless you are familiar with them in that format.  IF you don't care one way or another, this is a tremendous collection and the only reason it didn't receive the full 5 stars is because they aren't all in stereo.  When that version is out, you can be assured I'll be buying that copy right away.  As far as Greatest Hits collections go, you would be hard pressed to find a better selection than this one.hile I await for this collection to be re-issued entirely in stereo, what makes this edition entirely acceptable is the fact that for the vast majority, most of these songs were heard in mono to begin with, so its difficult to judge how much better they COULD be unless you are familiar with them in that format.

1582701709|4.0|I give The Secret four stars and not five - only because it isn't a secret at all because there are numerous books, CDs, seminars etc all saying the same things as this book. There is though some nuggets in here that make it worth buying - it has some very informative views from some of the self-help gurus and the section on your feelings making your thoughts is valuable. How hard do you find it to monitor the thousands of thoughts per day running through your hear? Really hard. The Secret notes that it isn't your thoughts you need to monitor but your feelings (which in turn create your thoughts). Actually, while this book isn't anything as new as it makes out it has got good stuff in here. We all know though that the \\"secret\\" to success is to get into action and think positive, stop judging people and get out there and make contact with the other humans. I'm glad though that this book has provoked such interest and sales because I believe the more mainstream that the ideas of spirituality and the universe become the better off we'll all be.

0375836675|4.0|This is a very strange book, peopled by apathetic characters who have no purpose in life and no desire to change their circumstances or to better themselves. Ed Kennedy is a 20 year old man who left school as soon as he was able, to work as a cab driver and who hasn't tried in any way to improve his lot. He and his two mates, Marvin and Ritchie, hang out a lot together, playing card games, drinking and just generally waiting for time to pass. Ed secretly loves Audrey, another cab driver who works for the same company as he does but who insists on treating him just as a friend. After Ed foils a bank robbery (purely by accident), a series of instructions in the form of playing cards begins to appear and Ed feels an absolute compulsion to follow the messages. It's a very strange book about redeeming oneself by helping others which I followed and finished, but can't honestly say that I enjoyed. I gave it 4 stars for the quality of the writing which exactly conveyed the setting, the ambience of the surroundings and the genuineness of the characters.
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|This is an exceptionally strange recording.  Someone has recruited some highly attractive women (their accompanying photos look like a Victoria's Secret spread) who also happen to play string music.  They have formed (or been formed into) a group that pits their fiddling against a heavy, synthesized rhythm track. The music has its occasional classical touches (including Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker\\"), but it mostly sounds like Latin music (of the \\"Tico Tico\\" variety).  I defer to the people who like it, but it's about the most bizarre music I've heard, and I'm frankly sorry for those who apparently haven't heard the sound of acoustic violins and violas--or haven't heard a decent live rhythm section.
B000O178BY|5.0|......and if you don't think so, no one cares.  Thats the beauty of this album, its noisy, its loud, its annoying, its beautiful, and it makes no excuses.  One warning, you will have flashbacks to the old industrial days. Oh and, no, this is not The Downward Spiral, its Year Zero!!
B000O178BY|5.0|Just wanted to state real quick that if you were really sour at a lot of the overall sound of \\"With Teeth\\" (and even maybe the resulting tour that spawned a DVD, \\"Beside You in Time\\") and/but you just can't get enough of older noisy classics like \\"Fixed\\" and \\"Further Down the Spiral\\", this album is probably the album you always wanted by/from Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor.  So buy it now.  ;P  If you are just a casual fan of NIN and just like some of the singles played on the radio, and you actually thought \\"With Teeth\\" was a masterpiece, you will probably hate this album, but oh well.  Looks like MTR went back to basics and focused on why his hardcore fans liked him in the first place, making a brilliantly urgent, extremely noisy and very buried-in-the-mix chaotic masterpiece.  :)  Overall, this is an excellent album in my opinion, and without going into too much detail about why, just think if you are more of a NIN \\"singles only\\" fan (probably would not like this) or \\"B-sides are better\\" fan (probably would like this).  Okay?  Great.  :)  9.5/10
B000O178BY|5.0|I have to be a little blunt, but when With Teeth came out, I didn't feel like it was up to all the hype put forth by Reznor. There were some awesome songs on it, and even my 51 year old mother LOVES (read: dances to) the song \\"Only.\\" The last half, as one reviewer said, was indeed \\"kinkier\\" and even quite beautiful, and some of the earlier ones like \\"The Collector\\" and \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" really pulled it all together.<br /><br />THIS ALBUM TOTALLY RENEWED MY FAITH IN NAILS.<br /><br />I started at the short intro songs and was hooked. I have to admit that I also hate singles, and I somewhat shuddered when I heard \\"Survivalism\\" for the first time, simply because it was a single and I had already heard it. To end the anticlimax, Reznor has put forth a string of really / internally complicated but very very minimal compositions that deliver hard and densely. It's actually quite impressive. It feels more industrial than anything he has released in the last six years. I would say this album is like the Left half of the Fragile and Downward Spiral / Closer To God [EP] cds combined. Add a little Pretty Hate Machine to it as well.<br /><br />Enough of the technical crap. This album is beautiful but very dense. If you pay the entire album an experience all at once, you will go through a very intricate web of ideas and images of our society and our emotional responses to crises, and even the music itself. You may get angry, even.<br /><br />There's piano, lots of guitar distortions, sampled and triggered drums, great lyrics, even some serious electronica.<br /><br />I CAN'T BELIEVE SAUL WILLIAMS DID A SONG ON HERE!!!

0783230370|5.0|Emma Thompson as Dr. Diana Redding need I say more?  The most prose English actress out there had the most wonderful physical comedy role in her carrear... playing a klux.  <br /> <br />  From the first moment that Emma showed herself in the movie when she literally jumped ontop of the run away freezer and she shouts \\"Help me!  Help me Now!\\" as she rolls down the ramp and into the lab and Arnold stops the freezer and she falls ontop of him.  You knew you had a hit.  It was wonderful that she knees him as she is getting to his feet and you can't help but laugh as the strong Arnold gets to his feet holding onto his family jewels with both hands. <br /> <br />  The romance between Diana and Alex starts off at the convience when they dance.  Now everyone knows that Emma is a wonderful dancer in her own right; but the way she handled herself in \\"Junior\\" was top notch.  Especially when she spies the toliet paper on her shoe.  Kicking off her shoe to send it sailing into a plate of salad was simply classic.  I loved how Alex bent down and put Diana's shoe back on, total Cinderella moment here folks, I loved Emma's stance as she looked down into Alex's face.  <br /> <br />  I loved it when Diana showed up at Larry's house and she started to talk about how she knew Alex from before and how she had a physical connection to him; her surprise when Alex said it was sexual.  Their kissing scene was hilourous especially when she went over the tipped couch.  Total great moment when she was leaving the house and she was leaning into Alex's quick kisses; and the purse strap in the door was simply divine. <br /> <br />  Emma did a wonderful job when Alex finally told her the truth about \\"Junior\\", I could feel her pain over the loss of her frozen egg and the loss of her being the one to carry HER own baby.  The song morgluge was wondeful although I wish they should more of Emma in it.  <br /> <br />I loved it when she showed up at the retreat, the setting and the clothes were simply beautiful and I wish they had more time to talk more about what Alex had done to her.  I loved it in his private room with Emma at the mirror and her looking at the sleeping Alex.  I wish Diana said more to the baby before she left the room. <br /> <br />  I wish Diana and Larry had more time to fight over his stealing her egg and impregnanting Alex with it.  I mean that issue simply had to be addressed more.  But I loved it at the clinic when Larry had to kick her out of the delivary room because of the danger; you could see the sheer fear in Emma's eyes.  When she was in the waiting room with Angela was simply brillant; what a way to take Diana's mind off of what was going on with Alex and her baby when she had to help Angela with her conactions. <br /> <br />  I loved the line of Diana's \\"I have a little girl\\", usually that's the waiting father's line.  I loved it when she was in the room with Alex and her daughter and she got to meet her daughter for the first time.  I wish Diana had the chance to hold her child to her in the movie, she never got to hold her child. <br /> <br />  The romance waits way better than the plot.  I was doubtful when I heard that Emma was playing against Aronld; but Aronld surprised me as he did in \\"Twins\\" and \\"Kingteon Cop\\".   Total 10 stars for the romance and 2 1/2 for the plot.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Leave it to Avril, when so many bands out there are going away from a rock sound to more of a whiny, lush, dreary \\"emo\\" style, she comes back with a semi-punk but mostly pop record with fast paced rock songs. THANK YOU!!! If I hear another song by Fall Out Boy or Panic At the Disco I think I will puke. Avril mixes it up here, providing huge hooks, catchy riffs, and her usual sarcastic lyrics. While the melodies are not always original, her attitude carries this over the top. Sure, she's a little rough at times, but she is way more tolerable than the boys who wear eyeliner and cry for three hours about why their girlfriends left them. This CD is a breath of fresh air, and people who take it too seriously should just not buy it. Avril had fun making this record, and it shows. To all the critics who lost the meaning of rock and roll over the past fifteen years, it is supposed to be fun at times. If you have a problem with Avril, take your stupid Nickleback and Killers CD's and go play them repeatedly in a dark corner somewhere. This CD will be blasting out of cars all summer long, all over the world. I LOVE IT!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.<br /><br />The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen onscreen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of \\"Rosebud\\" as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.<br /><br />The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.<br /><br />The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\", which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing.olated mountaintop estate, Xanadu. <br /> <br />The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption.

0393061434|3.0|Although I did not think the book is well written, I still enjoyed Steve's story. <br /> <br />The author often repeats himself and at times the story jumps around a bit. <br />It's written from an engineer's perspective which I found quite refreshing. <br /> <br />What I did not like was the way in which Steve reminds you, every now and then, how smart and noble he is and how he was the first to think of (and invent) a whole bunch of things. <br />He also takes a bit of a stab at Steve Jobs at a couple of occasions. <br /> <br />It's not a great book but it's not bad either, I would say buy a second hand one if you can. <br />
B000002UAO|5.0|I don't think the title for my review is much of an exaggeration. This album has more lyrical and musical substance than 99.99% of today's bloated, 70 minute, snooze-fest albums. Why is it that music listeners' attention spans have gotten shorter yet album lengths have gotten longer? I'm not sure but I think this album is perfect. If this album were written today the Beatles would be pressured into lengthening each song until the album filled the capacity of today's Compact Discs, the album would be twice as long and half as good. It really is the musical density and the pace of this album that makes it so special. The songs are very sophisticated yet accessible, catchy yet not overly repetitive. Every band today should be required to listen to this album. It is a pop formula that works.   <br /> <br />The Beatles were famous for saying they \\"...don't believe in talent, just hard work.\\" I think that quote is more profound than today's musicians care to recognize although I happen to feel that talent played some part in the Beatles success. Today \\"talent\\" is strictly reserved for reality T.V. shows such as American Idol and \\"hard work\\" is almost a dirty word in the music industry.  <br /> <br />Well, I think I will listen to the album again and forget that we may very well be living through the dark ages of pop music. Oh by the way, Rubber Soul is an album (a collection of songs) not a C.D. (a round piece of plastic). A great album is a great album whether it is on a Cassette, C.D., or Vinyl record. However, most of today's music fails to be much more than a round piece of plastic.  <br /> <br />
B000NA1OXY|3.0|I have been a huge Avril fan since her first single Complicated. That being said besides about 5 songs on this album it doesn't even compare to her first 2 strong releases. This album consists of 3 songs which kinda sound alot alike. I mean I like the Girlfriend song alright, but to put 2 other songs on the album that sound just like it, pretty much doesn't make sense. I will say I like the songs Keep Holding On, Innocence, Runaway, When You're Gone, and Hot is an alright song too. But overall, this album may remind you of an artist trying to sound more rock, something that she isn't. She has a powerful voice built for alt. pop & ballads. She seems like she tried to go Cyndi Lauper/Joan Jett on some of this release. Me not being the hugest Cyndi or Joan Jett fan, makes this album just a half & half release. Also some of the songs may remind you a little of some of the bad stuff the Go Go's put out. The cursing thing is ridiculous too. I guess she's trying show that's she's getting older by doing that, but it only sounds like she's immaturring by doing that. A lot of young kids have grew up listening to her, and that's stuff they don't need to be hearing in the music they listen to. Thank goodness for the editing on this version, but still there are some stuff that should still be left out! Come on Avril, you can do better than this, and I really mean that! I guess we can only hope that she gets back to her strong alt/pop ballad stuff for her next release. I give the album a little better than a 2.5 out of 5.
B000NIVJEU|3.0|I didn't think the movie was horrible like a lot of posters here; it was hackneyed and very disjointed but not terrible. The acting was average and the story seemed like it needed about another 45-minutes to properly explain everything that was going on. The special effects are top rate and really saves the movie from being junk (e.g. Dungeons and Dragons.)<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is the best part of the movie; the picture and audio are fantastic and there are quite a few nice extras. Still, I would rent the disc first to see how much you like the movie before buying.
0307346609|5.0|In a culture fixated on self-help manuals and \\"The Secret\\" to a content life, how can anyone resist reading \\"An Oral History of the Zombie War\\"? The title alone demands immediate attention. This is stuff we need to know now!<br /><br />With a bit of skepticism, I picked up \\"World War Z\\" and began following our intrepid reporter's globe-trotting tales of the war's survivors. Told in a pseudo-journalistic style, this book never fails to entertain (as any good novel should), and never fails to use the zombie phenomenon as a lens for examining society's ills.<br /><br />Every once in a while, some satirical wit manages to bite through the calluses of our culture--and Max Brooks book does exactly that. From his comments on the media's use of fear, to the government's bumbling ways in the midst of disastrous happenings, to the human drive to survive, \\"World War Z\\" is a gruesome, intelligent, and memorable addition to the world of literature.<br /><br />If you're looking for extreme elements of horror, you may be disappointed. If you're hoping for a scathing diatribe of all that's wrong in our world, you'll be only temporarily soothed. But, if you're ready for a brilliant mix of entertainment and social commentary, Max Brooks will humbly welcome you into his undead world.
B0002B15XI|5.0|In the opening moments of this joyously, soberly brilliant film, an instantly engaging balladeer serendades and assaults us with these outrageous lyrics, while we watch helicopters ferry their grim burdens of wounded men back to a medical unit behind the lines in Korea. This comic and absurdist film captured and helped form the blithe irreverence of the 60's counterculture. Along with Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July, which is of course anything but a comedy, MASH is the truest reflection of that period of American history on film. Its spirit is caught perfectly in one short take. A player on the bench of the football team whose coach, an Army colonel, is  much too serious about everything, takes a hit on a joint with a bland expression of carelessness and amusement. He's not taking anything too seriously, and we know he's right. Ah! If only everything had worked out that simply! Thank you, Robert Altman, for showing us how to laugh at the merchants of death.
B000001GQH|5.0|While Herbert Von Karajan was known mostly as a conductor whose bent was the Austro-German repertoire, I've always thought that Karajan was as good (and sometimes better) in the French and Russian repertoire.<br /><br />While there are many outstanding renditions of Debussy's &#34;La Mer&#34; by the likes of Charles Munch, Arturo Toscanini, Pierre Boulez and others; Karajan certainly seems to hold his own, in a fine and very well polished reading that falls just a little bit short in terms of not fully capturing the essence of Debussy's dream-like quality.  Likewise, while a shiny and well-formed &#34;Pictures at an Exhibition&#34; seems to be good enough, there are other recordings of &#34;Pictures&#34; (i.e. Bernstein/NYPO) that seem to shine brighter and probe deeper.<br /><br />As for Karajan's recording of Ravel's &#34;Bolero&#34;; it is excellent; perhaps even better than Karajan himself intended it to be. Something must have been right on the day that this recording of &#34;Bolero&#34; was made where the Berlin Philharmonic happened to put together a wonderful recording that fully captures a very raw feeling of intensity despite the fact that the music is all polished and waxed in typical Karajan fashion. It is indeed an irony that while Karajan worked hard to perfect his Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, with as many as four or five recordings of the same pieces throughout his lengthy career, that he was able to pull off an ideal &#34;Bolero&#34; in one shot.<br /><br />All-in-all, four stars each for &#34;La Mer&#34; and &#34;Pictures&#34;; five for &#34;Bolero&#34;.
0679746323|4.0|\\"I look at his face and see Stalin\\", Krushchev says about Mao.  That, in a nutshell, is the theme of this extremely well documented and persuasive book.  There are three great bad men of the 20th Century:  Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.  The authors believe there is not a dime's worth of difference between any of them and embark, with admirable singleness of purpose, to deconstruct the brilliant work done by Mao to mythologize himself.   <br /> <br />By digging into newly available archives and by interviewing a great number of witnesses, the authors contend that Mao was a completely unprincipled megalomaniac.  The only thing that explains his behavior is building his own power.  There is no ideology.  And the authors take delight in showing the completely barren, if not evil, landscape of his personal life.   <br /> <br />The book is important for demystifying Mao.  But it is more polemic than history.  What's not explained is how Mao succeeded in gaining and wielding power.  If the authors are to be believed, someone would have squashed this loathsome bug a generation ago.  Hitler had his personal magnetism and speechmaking.  Stalin was brilliant with the bureaucracy.  Mao had neither.  And the authors hate their subject so much that they refuse to acknowlege any redeeming virtues that would explain what must have been some appeal that allowed him to amass so much power.  <br /> <br />But there are some hints here:  it does appear that Mao had an uncanny ability to spot the weaknesses in his subordinates and to manipulate them for his own ends.  The authors are especially good in analyzing Mao's curious relationship with and manipulation of Chou En Lai.   <br /> <br />Readers looking for a Caro-style analysis of Mao's psychology, abilities to use power, and ideologies that at first amassed but then were corrupted by power will be disappointed.  This biography is a bit one dimensional.   <br /> <br />Another issue the authors don't grapple with is the extent to which great men (whether good or bad) control or are controlled by events.  The authors seem to assume that great men control history entirely and assume the 20th century was determined by the personalities of Stalin and Mao.  That's a bit of a stretch, though a natural prejudice of a biographer. <br /> <br />In all, though, the book is fascinating.  The Stalin-Mao relationship is dealt with at length.  The theory is that Mao really did owe much of his success to Stalin's support.  And so these nominally revisionist historians actually end up going back to the old orthodoxies of the 1950s:  there was an effective worldwide communist conspiracy.  But it's an orthodoxy that has a good deal of truth to it.

B000BCE7QU|5.0|Steve McQueen is an album I've been hoping to be re-mastered for years, along with Prefab's other great album, Jordan: The Comeback.  Jordan was an incredible album packed with great songs diverse both musically and lyrically.  SM was, however, more ethereal in its production with a sound that really has not been duplicated, ever.  Most people who listened to their first record, Swoon, are aware that Thomas Dolby, the producer, had an enormous influence on the outcome of SM.  Not only is the production different but the structure of the songs is better crafted.  Having at first listened to SM as a record, I always felt that the CD version lacked depth.  It must be added that the CD version I am used to is the American version of SM (called Two Wheels Good because the estate objected to the title).  That version included a fantastic extended version of Faron Young, a great county cover of He'll Have To Go and one more track.  When Love Breaks Down is also in an inferior state on Two Wheels Good, being slightly edited and mixed     Now, more than 20 years after its initial release the album has been re-released, re-mastered by Thomas Dolby himself.  The extra tracks from Two Wheels Good are nowhere to be found.  That is understandable since Dolby had nothing to do with that production and they were also not really part of the original Steve McQueen release.  On a brighter note, the better version of When Love Breaks Down is intact.      Although some recent re-mastered versions have improved the sound quality significantly, often it is simply because the transfer to the CD was initially incredibly sloppy.  Despite not being satisfied with the sound quality of Two Wheels Good, I cannot say that it was bad.  Many CD releases in their early stages simply were substandard and TWG was actually above the average for that period sound quality wise.  This makes the difference even more astonishing.  It is as if the music was transferred into 3-D.  Not only is there (much) added depth, the clarity and yet softness is way beyond what I am used to.  I even suspect that Dolby may have done some subtle re-mixing to obtain this effect because this is better than most productions done even in today's standards.  The only re-release that I can think of having been re-mastered closely as well is Fleetwood Mac's recent 2-CD edition of Rumours, but that version was initially transferred in an atrocious manner.  This re-mastered version would be worth the price alone.    There is, however, an extra CD included in this release.  Paddy McAloon decided to re-record acoustically 8 of the 11 songs from SM, as opposed to the usual demo/different versions/live versions/omitted tracks route.  This is admirable both in regards of bothering to set so much effort in a re-release project (recording of the acoustic set took supposedly much longer than the initial one) and also taking the chance re-recording classics that probably are a hard act to follow.  What surprised me is how complex the arrangements are.  Instead of Paddy strumming through the tracks with a guitar in his hands, most of the songs are complex interactions of guitars woven together.  Many of them are also re-arranged in a fashion that they are almost like different songs.  This works well on most of the songs but it most be kept in mind that in general people listening to these tracks are biased, being used to the older versions, including me.    The standout track is, surprising, Desire As.  The acoustic version is almost unrecognizable from the original one and, dare I say, better than the original one.  Another track which falls into that category is When the Angels, a lovely version that brings the text more to life.  The two tracks that I feel are lacking are Bonny and Goodbye Lucille #1.  Bonny is my favorite Prefab Sprout track, period, so maybe that makes it simply almost impossible for me being unbiased, but the singing is way below Paddy's usual standards and the arrangement lackscohesion.  Goodbye Lucille #1 needed actually more re-arranging because the vocal interaction makes the song special but with only one voice it does not work out.  Faron Young has a Western feel in this arrangement and becomes very addictive after a few listens.  When Love Breaks Down, however, has a sweet feel, approaching the performance with a gentle approach once again but from a different angle.  Trying to maintain an objective stance, I rate this version as a 4 star record.    This set, however, is a 5 star project, both sonically and musically and very worth purchasing, both for those who own it already and others who still lack one of the most ethereal and stunningly produced releases in the last few decades.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|...is the common argument you will hear if you take the time to read some of the lowest rated reviews for MCR's latest album \\"The Black Parade.\\"  Many, if not most, of these reviews lack any sort of careful musical analysis or any traits that translate into an informative and objective album review. <br /> <br />With that in mind I invite everyone who has not to go ahead and listen to a couple songs off of MCR's first studio album \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\\"  I have always maintained that the simple fact of the matter is My Chemical Romance has really not changed their original sound all that much.  The thing that makes \\"The Black Parade\\" great is what the band has always done since they began - these guys really know how to write a hard-rockin' tune with phenomonal melodic hooks.  With this, their third studio album, the popularity of the band definately shines through as it is pretty clear that their record label has stepped in to \\"adjust\\" the band's sound just a little bit. <br /> <br />As I said, My Chemical Romance have stayed true to their original formula since day 1, but the tunes have certainly been \\"cleaned up\\" a little bit.  This is definately not a terrible thing and it should be expected with any band that becomes as popular as MCR has since the release of \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.\\"  Singer Gerard Way, who used to explode into a frantic vocal delivery at any given moment is now forced to save these outbursts for key points in songs.  The drums have also been significantly simplified as well as rhythm guitar.  Bassist Mikey Way plays the bare minimum to get by but that has been his gig since the first album.  The man who truly shines on \\"The Black Parade\\" is lead guitarist Ray Toro who is given the freedom to bust out one guitar solo after another while continually providing excentric leads and, when performing live, taking all of the vocal harmonies (although Toro's skill in the latter is certainly debatable.) <br /> <br/>\\"The Black Parade\\" is a fantastic album and contains some of the best songs that the band has ever put out.  Songs like \\"The Sharpest Lives,\\" \\"Welcome to the Black Parade,\\" \\"Mama,\\" and closing track \\"Famous Last Words\\" mark the high points of the rocking songs contained on this album, each of them staying true to the original MCR formula of heavy rock with fantastic vocal melodies and hooks.  The songs also give a lot of insight into MCR's influences - Queen as seen on \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" is so obvious anybody could tell.  Songs like \\"Mama,\\" \\"Teenagers,\\" and the hidden track \\"Blood\\" also explore a more surrealist and absurdist approach to songwriting that the band obviously adopted during the writing process as well. <br /> <br />The album also has some great softer tracks, most notably \\"Disenchanted.\\"  However, the thing that keeps me from giving this album 5 stars is that, while there are some great songs, there are also a few too many songs that feel like \\"filler tracks.\\"  \\"I Don't Love You,\\" \\"Cancer,\\" and \\"Sleep\\" most notably, just didn't do it for me and feel like they were written with little care.  Essentially, they are lacking the frantic delivery that I have come to love from MCR.  This is why I love their first album.  \\"I Brought You...\\" will always be my favorite MCR album and, like several other reviewers here, I am stuck deciding between this album and \\"Three Cheers\\" for which one is my second favorite.  As a result, this cutting-edge album which receives a bad rep because the band is too \\"emo\\" gets a solid 4-stars from me.  \\"The Black Parade\\" is highly recommended for new and old fans alike and is a great depiction of a band that has slowly developed yet stayed true to their original formula.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release.  To say the least I am disappointed.  I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep.  Where is the range of work?  All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating.
B00005JNTX|3.0|Well, the appeal of this movie pretty much resides entirely in the coolness factor. You know, where gruesome things and unusual events are displayed to stimulate the viewer's gut reactions (such as excitement, disgust, arousal, awe, etc) in a very pornographic sort of way.    This works wonders in certain segments. The story of the kid who murders prostitutes, for example, has quite the well-executed combination of excitement, disgust and awe-induction. It is disgusting, exciting, awe-inducing, exactly like it's supposed to be. Coolness achieved. Very cool.    But the part about the prostitutes with guns killed it for me... it was so boring and so illogical and it took up probably 1/3 of the movie. Yes, they are prostitutes, they have guns, that's supposedly arousing... I get it. I got it after the first five seconds. You can't drag that out for what seems like an hour without an actual story, and the \\"story\\" in this case was an illogical hole-ridden mess, clearly just a sorry attempt at justifying the lengthy scenes of scantily clad prostitutes. I mean, I get that this movie is supposed to be glorifying the tacky and hormonal elements of the comic book/neo-noir genre... but that whole segment adds absolutely nothing to this idea, and was not one bit better than watching a random porn movie.    In conclusion... I appreciate all of this movie, except for the 1/3 or so that was taken up by the prostitutes-with-guns segment, which I ferociously despise. So I'm not really sure what to think of this movie as a whole... I guess it all evens out to be sort of mediocre. It's an amazing film when I fast forward through the stupid part, but I can't really give this movie any credit for my own post-release editing.

B00005NB0H|5.0|Some say this is the greatest live rock album of all-time . . . I won't say this as I know I haven't heard every live rock album out there.  In my book, however, \\"Live at Leeds\\" is at the top . . . the problem is deciding between this version or the bootleg \\"Live at Leeds Complete\\". This version has cleaner audio but it is also \\"painted over\\" having heard LAL-Complete. I suppose it is nice though having a single live CD of Tommy which happens to be better than the original album (though the purist in me wants to protest that they cut up the concert in order to do this). <br /> <br />All in all, you're not a Who fan if you don't own at least one version of this concert (the original, bootleg, or deluxe version) and this version I highly recommend.   <br /> <br />If you're new to the Who, I would recommend this concert first above anything else . . . it captures most everything essential (most importantly, that this is a band all about the live performance). <br /> <br />For hardcore fans who already own Live at Leeds original, this is a worthwhile purchase especially for comparative studies with Live at Leeds Complete. <br /> <br />No, this Deluxe edition isn't \\"Complete\\" . . . but it is still, in my opinion,  better than the original Live at Leeds album.
B000000OA6|2.0|I love Queen.  I purchased Innuendo because of the great reviews.  I think \\"I Can't Live With You\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" are awesome.   I did not enjoy any of the other songs.  Compared to the classic \\"A Night At the Opera\\" this album is very disappointing.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|for a while i didn't get this band... because their singer sounds similar to thom yorke, i was expecting to get what you get from a radiohead song, which makes them sound boring... it took pulling an allnighter of work listening to muse and something hit me... this group sounds a lot more like philip glass than it does like radiohead or queen. they have the texture of a dramatic prog-rock band, but their songs are very minimalist: with drawn-out and carefully building ups and downs that leave you with the feeling that you're just floating along as you listen. the songs aren't very exciting, but that's not the point. absolution as an album blends together well as one full piece, and all the smaller pieces within it lock together so sweetly :)
1582701709|4.0|I've got to say this right off--I felt that I was being talked down to throughout Rhonda Byrne's \\"The Secret.\\"  Sure, it's helpful to have a little bit of \\"wrap up\\" for what each \\"teacher\\" has to say, tying each piece to the previous one so there's good flow.  However, Byrne's reiterating even the most basic idea is simply redundant.  If this was an attempt to appeal to the masses, it's my opinion that Byrne went overboard.  I appreciate that \\"The Secret\\" is a compilation of so many ideas and teachings in one place, I just think that with the simple yet powerful message presented by the originals, the commentary took away.  I would've preferred to read more of what the teachers had to say in their own words.  I guess that now, at least, I have a jumping off point for further study if I want it.  That's something.  That said, the ideas presented in \\"The Secret\\" are an affirmation of the changes I've made in my own life in the past five years.  By changing my attitude and way of thinking, my life has done a 180; it wasn't always easy, nor was it painless, BUT it did work.  So, even though I may still have doubts about some of the subject matter, I DO believe in the underlying message and will continue to incorporate quite a few of the principles in \\"The Secret\\" into my life and mindset.  In spite of what may seem like a negative review, this is still a book I think is worth taking the time to read (and I have a few people I may loan my copy out to as well).

B000NA1OXY|5.0|I have to admit listening to the snippets on AOL almost made me not want the album. I bought it anyway and thought the snippets did not do her justice. This album is spunky, catchy, and full of spirit. I think this rivals her previous releases and only a fool would pass this up!
B000MZHW40|4.0|I can't really speak to the accuracy of the material (I've seen other reviewers here who questioned it).  I'll just say that I, for one, was convinced.  I found the movie very compelling...yeah, it kind of devolved into cliches near the end, yet the earlier part of the movie was so good that I was already invested enough to suspend some disbelief (Leonardo's character was really good at dodging bullets, huh?)  The acting was terrific all around and the pacing was good.  I do agree with another reviewer, though, who said that there were some superfluous scenes that could have been edited out.  Overall---4 out of 5 stars, deserving of acclaim, and one of the more memorable films of the last year.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|I first saw Cinema Paradiso in 1990 in Hong Kong.  It's a movie that nicely knitted the nostalgia of childhood, adolescence, puppy love, and, of course, the good-old-days in cinemas (not multiplex).  Each time a cinema, or even small multiplex, was closed or demolished in Hong Kong, people would refer to this movie for their \\"collective memory\\" and the heyday of Hong Kong cinema.  This movie transcends national boundaries!
B000KJU1MS|5.0|This is an awesome collection of live performances and extras that really show what it took to make it in the music biz. These guys had the hunger and the drive.
B000O178BY|5.0|Trent never fails to impress me.    But this time he outdid himself.    This album is the result of years and years of struggle and perseverance for Mr. Reznor and i truly believe that this is his most complex and conceptual work to date.    This album will force you to examine what is happining to our world, and it inspires you to consider the possibility of a coming revolution.    It could very well help change the world for the better.    This is a rare, honest, and one-of-a-kind experience that will stick with you.    JOIN THE RESISTANCE! [...]
1591841666|4.0|I received an advance copy of The Dip by Seth Godin and read it in one night. The book is not only a quick read but it helped define something I have been struggling with my entire life, the dip. This book teaches you how to get through the dip, and to assess whether or not you want to enter the dip in the first place. The Dip is relevant for Detroit, Ann Arbor and all of Michigan as we struggle with the downturn of the auto industry. I trust this book will make a positive impact.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|I put this DVD in my home theater with surround-sound and must admit that the last 20 minutes of this movie, I literally felt transported into the screen.  The effects are that good as well as frightening.  The scene called \\"ceasefire\\" was gut-wrenchingly poignant.  Now to the movie.  It was pretty good though not as great as the critics seemed to say.  The plot was a little difficult to understand.  It appears that Britain in this wacky future world is the only \\"intact\\" country remaining after world-wide anarchy has taken place over mankind's inability to reproduce.  Even Britain itself is a hornets nest of pitched battles itself with more chaos than what is going on in Iraq.  The government seems to have been cracking down on \\"illegal\\" aliens; hunting them down. <br /> <br />Julanne Moore is the rebel leader and she is gunned down rather early in the movie.  The other rebels are harboring an alien who is pregnant.  Clive Owen's character overhears the rebels plotting to kill him and the woman after she gives birth.  This causes him to flee with the pregnant woman and go into hiding. <br /> <br />I should mention that Owen gives another great performance as well as Michael Caine, who is an aged Woodstock-type hippie. <br /> <br />The ending leaves the viewer with some hope that better things should come, and leaves the movie open for a possible sequel.   <br />
B000065BPB|5.0|Ok, so I bought a pair of these babies, plugged 'em in, put 'em on, and nearly started crying I was so disappointed. I even went so far as to go out and purchase a set of Sony MDR-7506's which had been my second choice following my initial research. <br /> <br />Well, guess what? A month and a half later I can't get enough of the Sennheisers. So they either went through a \\"burn-in\\" process or I got used to their sound which at first seemed rather \\"clinical.\\" I now choose to believe their sound is \\"accurate.\\" <br /> <br />They seemed a little bass-shy at first but now they sound just right. Kind've like the difference in sound between loudness control on and loudness control off. At first, when you turn your loudness control off, the bass sounds very weak and even the midrange sounds thin. The treble can be very strident, much too shrill. <br /> <br />But after you get used to listening with the loudness off, the sound only seems to get better and better. And in my mind that's because it's more accurate. <br /> <br />Well, that's the way these headphones grew on me. The longer I use them, the better they sound. And, yeah, some of it may be due to the \\"burn-in\\" effect, but I think mostly it's due to accuracy. <br /> <br />
B000MZHW40|4.0|Against the turbulent backdrop of political, economic and social upheaval in Africa Leonardo DiCaprio plays the part of Danny Archer, a white, native from Zimbabwe and former soldier-of-fortune turned diamond smuggler. He is a man with no wife, no children and since the murder of his parents, no country. Now in search of a fabulous diamond that rumor says was buried in the jungle by enforced laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Housou), Danny promises that he will help Solomon find his missing family if he shows him where the diamond is located. Solomon agrees and the dangerous journey begins.<br /><br />`Blood Diamond' released in '06 is a taut, well executed action/adventure, drama starring two of the best actors in the business today, Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housnsou. Add to the mix the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen and you have an enjoyable evening of viewing ahead.<br /><br />My rating: 4 ½ Stars.
B000006045|5.0|This is an awesome album... I say this because it flows well from one song to the next without all the songs sounding the same or anything. <br /> <br />The songs have a techno feel without being highly repetitive and annoying as some techno has a tendancy to be. <br /> <br />Best song on this album I think is \\"Risingson\\" because of the quaility vocals... but \\"Dissolved Girl\\" also is very good and has good vocals as well. If you didn't know this already \\"Dissolved Girl\\" was heard in the first Matrix movie (though it doesn't appear on the soundtrack). It's the song Neo is playing on his headphones when he's asleep at his computer near the start of the movie...  <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|Do you remember the first time that you saw one of the original Star Wars movies?  I saw A New Hope at my grandparent's house when I was nine.  These are the kinds of movies that make an impression on you.  The special effects aren't as good as the new movies, but the story is amazing.  Good versus Evil.  The Light Side versus the Dark.  Father versus Son.  This way you can enjoy the trilogy again without all of Lucas' later \\"improvements\\" to the special effects.  If you were ever a Star Wars fan, this set will remind you why!
B000BKDOB6|5.0|Definitely one of the best albums in the history of recorded music, made even BETTER than the original! What more can be said? What more can you ask for? <br /> <br />Highly recommended. Unfortunately, Patti will never better this one no matter how long she keeps recording.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|`Children of Men' released in '07 presents the viewer a grim, sobering vision of a future world quickly moving towards certain extinction. The year is 2027 and the earth is devoid of children. No one knows for sure why women suddenly became infertile, but it has now been years since the last birth. Without a new generation to replace the old the human race will soon cease to exist. With no tomorrow to look forward society has broken up into various warring factions and chaos runs wild in the streets. In an attempt to maintain some semblance of order a totalitarian government rules England, a regime no better than the factions opposing it.<br /><br />All appears lost until one man stumbles upon a possible hope for the future. Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is asked to help escort a young woman out of the city to a place of safety. At first hesitate to get involved in a stranger's affairs, everything changes when he discovers her all important secret. She's pregnant.<br /><br />`Children of Men' delivers excellent production values, a unique storyline and great performances by Clive Owen and Michael Caine. It's a little heavy-handed in metaphor and symbolic imagery, but overall a well done, highly imaginative film that provides both action/adventure and thought provoking drama. Well worth a watch or two.
B000002H6C|5.0|I remember my very first time puting this album in my cd player when i was 13 years old. i remember thinking \\"theres no way this could possibly be better then master of puppets\\". well i was wrong, this album grabed me by the balls and flung me across the room. ever sence my first listen there has NEVER been a time that i would say\\" you know, i dont feel like listening to and justice for all\\". not only dose this album have some great guitar tone and massive drum sound. but it is possibly the most flawless metal piece i ever put my ears to. weather its James Hetfield's bone crushing riffs and epic guitar harmonies, of lars ulrich's devastating and innovateive use of drum beats, this album is for ever engraved into metal as a master piece. \m/
B000O178BY|4.0|So were here in 2007 with a new NIN cd out at an alarmingly high speed for Trent.  Ive been a diehard fan for a long time of the one man genius that is Nine Inch Nails, and I can easily say that Year Zero is completely different from anything hes done. Some people are calling it a return to form after \\"the fragile and with teeth\\" to a more noise oriented NIN. And theyre not wrong but theyre not right either. The records hard to pin, if youve heard any NIN then it will sound familiar to you. However what hes done with just the music an noises take that familiar sound to uncharted territories. If this record was completely instrumental it would still be worth the money. There are sooo many layers to this album that its unreal.  <br /> <br />That being said I have to point out to quick things. 1. The best (and really Only) way to listen to this record is with surround sound, high bass, full volume. Let your neighborhood know in advance though.  and 2. This album must be listened to more than just once. finally 3. Dont skip through tracks the first few listens this is something you gotta sink in as a whole. You'll get to hear survivalism dont worry. <br /> <br />Now something i havent yet talked about, the lyrics. What can I say about the lyrics that hasnt already been said? Im not sure, cause to be honest with ya the lyrics are out there. the lyrics are very interpretive, so dont listen to what anyone tells you about them (including me)    its easy to see how some people in their reviews are saying songs are \\"from aliens perspective\\" and from this or that but its all interpretive therefore you really cant KNOW. (for instance i think my violent heart is from the viewpoint of a terrorist) But believe me youll get a good idea from most songs.  <br /> <br />I remember first hearing that NIN was doing a \\"political\\" album and thinking \\"it could be good but i hope its smarter than 'the hand that feeds'\\"  My expectations were met the music is loud, noisy, and something old people are sure to shake there fists about. The lyrics are smart and compelling. The hooks are still present and still as catchy as ever. This is still the same Nine Inch Nails you know and love, only now its focused. <br />To end my review ill do the obligatory trend of putting my favorite songs from it on here ( even though you dont care) <br />Standouts -imho- <br />:::::::::::::: <br /> <br />Me, Im not <br />My violent heart <br />Meet your master <br />the greater good <br />and capital G <br /> <br /> <br />thanks for reading my review now if youll be so kind as to decide if this was helpful to your or not, the buttons are availabe to push :)

1594200823|3.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma could have been a tour de force, a Silent Spring.  But Michael Pollan is no Rachael Carson.  Much of the research is sound, but what about fact checking, the case against as well as for, and where to go with his findings?  Instead of science, we have solipsism, for Michael Pollan is more fascinated with Michael Pollan than scientific method, which is to say, he's a generalist, a journalist, an entertainer.  He's preaching to the converted, the NYTimes readership; Michael wanted a best-seller, and he likely succeeded, no small feat and not unworthy.  Someone else will follow, and those of us who are not in Pollan's congregation will have him to thank him for setting the stage.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|3.5 stars.  I don't quite get the hype. Up until the Olive's big number, there wasn't really anything in this film that I haven't seen before.  I mean, the audience knows that book deal isn't going to go through the first time Richard utter the words.  Other than the first five minutes, Uncle Frank doesn't seem suicidial at all.  Can't pick apart Dewayne since he doesn't even talk until the third act.  And I find it highly unlikely that a family would pick up everything and rush to enter this thing WITHOUT seeing the girl's routine.  Everyone knows that Grandpa's whacked, what qualified him to be coaching their daughter for a pageant?<br />BUT what saves this movie is the acting talent.  Good performance CAN save a mediocre skript.  And Ms. Abigail is absolutely precious in this film.  I'm happy that she looked like what a seven year old should look like and not those life-size barbie dolls that are the norm for young beauty pageants that in this reviewer's opinion should be deemed criminal.  The only thing is: for this to have been Olive's dream to win, she didn't seem all that crushed when she didn't.
B00005O5CM|3.0|\\"Legally Blonde\\" (2001) directed by Robert Luketic stars Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods - a Californian golden girl who has it all - she is blonde, pretty, popular, adored by her wealthy parents and her friends in college where she is the president of her sorority. As we know from the movies, gentlemen prefer blondes but alas not a gentleman whom Elle is dating and expecting him to propose any minute. Instead, as the movie turns, the blondes also have blues because they are not taken seriously by the men from the blue blood families. When the object of Elle's desire heads off to Harward Law School, she decided to get him back by proving that the blondes have \\"a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything wrong with that?\\" The first step for Elle was to get admitted to the same school, and she did it. But that was only the beginning...<br /><br />You know, I've seen \\"Legally Blonde\\" several times and I know that it is not the best movie ever made, far from it but I like it. I am not a Witherspoon's fan, I don't find her a stunning beauty but she is a talented young actress who brought a certain charm to the role. I am also a true believer that \\"happy people just don't kill their husbands, they just don't\\" and I like how Reese delivers this piece of wisdom. The second Blonde movie is a different matter altogether and belongs to the category of absolutely useless sequels.<br /><br />3.5/5
B000NA1OXY|4.0|Avril is best known for her in your face style and lyrics and she delivers just that on her latest release: 'The Best Damn Thing'. She turns it up a few notches as far as grttiness and decible levels here.<br /><br />She is a talented young woman with a decent voice but sometimes she turns her good voice into too much screaming. I think she overused the whole chanting/cheerleading style on too many songs on here which kind of takes away from the orginality.<br /><br />Avril has a knack for writing and singing very catchy/radio friendly hooks and melodies like those on such songs as: \\"Girlfriend\\" - you will be singing/humming that for days on end, out of the blue.<br /><br />\\"I Can Do Better\\" is another very melody driven song that you cannot help but to sing along to as well as \\"Runaway\\".<br /><br />Where Avril really seems to shine is on the the slower ballad type songs where she sings with passion and really monopolizes her vocals. My favorite song on this CD is: \\"Innocence\\" - A slow, beautiful song that is destined to be on the top of the charts on the radio. A song bound to give you goosebumps. \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Keep Holding On\\" (from Eragon) are two other brilliant slower songs that are a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />It's a good CD. Like, I said, she steps it up a few notches. It's worth purchasing but, as far as it being the \\"best damn thing\\" you'll have to judge for yourself!<br /><br />~~~~JAC  07'
0060899190|4.0|The phenomenal popularity of this book (and the website) can be traced a comment Maya Angelou made many years ago. She said, \\"we are all more alike than we are different.\\" Somehow, reading these secrets is very comforting and unifying. When I read these mini-stories on each postcard, I realize that the trials and tribulations of my life parallel many other people's stories, too. Ditto for the joys.<br /><br />Reading these secrets also seems to nibble away on the corners of the profound loneliness that we all seem to be feeling. Back in the day, our sense of community was radically different. Houses were set in busy communities and front porches were a gathering place and a sweet spot for visiting. Now, we're all so busy and so tired and mired in our frenetic lives, that we can't enjoy the leisure of a front-porch visit.<br /><br />We *all* need someone to tell our secrets to and this post-secret project seems to provide a venue for that. So, it seems to be a blessing for both the writer (of the secrets) and the reader.<br /><br />The downside is, some of these \\"secrets\\" border on voyeurism and that's a little worrisome. Another downside is, the common theme I hear in many of these stories is that despite our mass communications network, we're all terribly lonely.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|With the Alien Quadrilogy set, I am not really sure where to even begin. Yes, all 4 films are here and all are presented wonderfully. But really, it's the extras here that are the star attractions for this release. By now, you have heard how large the extras are and how \\"exhaustive\\" they are. So wonderfully true. Going thru every disc and feeding on the special features that are here is an epic adventure in itself right along with the actual films. 9 discs in all!. Each film comes with a second disc full of all the bonus features. Almost every person imaginable is here and accounted for in the documentaries. There are featurettes on how the films got started, Pre-production featurettes, sketches, designs, trailers, differnt camera angle scenes, deleted/extended scenes, commentaries, photo galleries, special effects and creature designs, H.R. Giger, and so on. It seems endless. The bonus disc even has a new 64 minute documentary on the first film, a Ridley Scott Q&A and more. Seriously, you will be suffering from Alien overload once you are done with this set. You already know the films, so there is no real need to go into detail about every one. Each film comes in two versions - the original theatrical run, and a director's cut version. Some of those new cuts enhance the films(Aliens), some are unnecessary(Alien), and some just don't make that much of a difference(Alien 3 and 4). 1979's \\"Alien\\" is a classic masterpiece. Truly original and brilliant. The extras are great. Where is Yaphett Kotto and Ian Holm?. 1986's \\"Aliens\\" was one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron isn't as involved as other directors in the new features, but he is there. I find the documentaries and behind the scenes features here the most interesting. The demanding Cameron, the clashes with the London crew, and so on. Good stuff. 1992's \\"Alien 3\\" was where it fell apart. Fincher is a great director, and there are some good moments, but it was a major disappointment. The documentaries and features are far more fascinating. Once you watch them, you may feel for Fincher and how Alien 3 was an uphill battle from the get go. Fincher is also the only director who doesn't appear in new interviews for this set. 1997's \\"Alien Resurrection\\" was an improvement, but by no means was anywhere near as good as the first two. Writer Joss Whedon(of Buffy fame)has condemned the film every chance he gets. Resurrection is entertaining and has some good moments and factors to it. The film is not great, but it's not the unwatchable abomination Whedon thinks it is. If not that isn't enough, the set comes with a booklet that has a small overview of every film, and tells you where the extras are, what can be found on each disc, and their running time. The Alien Quadrilogy set is a mammoth experience that hasn't been matched yet. I can't imagine what it would take to even go further than this box set. The Alien films are batting 2 out of 4, but even the lesser films are better than a lot of other stuff that is out there. This is a must have.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I like a lot \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" - what a fun, grand movie - it's got all the right components to entertain, to take you into the different dimensions for 143 minutes of its duration - sweet innocence with an angel voice, mysterious creature of the dark - genius and madman, prince charming (who in this case is just a viscount but who cares?). The film itself is spectacular, gorgeous, sparkling with the colors so powerful, images so magic and real, and melodies so...familiar.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the new cinema born in front of me or just a return to old good times when cinema was supposed to entertain, to take you to the Dream Worlds - someone said once that new is well forgotten old. Whatever it was, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" directed by Joel Schumacher, the way \\"how it moves, how it looks, and how it plays\\" is perfection itself and who cares that the story is silly and naive? Certainly, not me.
B000O178BY|5.0|This is (in my opinion) is one of the best CD's since 'Pretty Hate Machine'. Not having to wait several years between CD's is great!! There was only a 2 year gap between 2005's 'With Teeth' and 'Year Zero' 2007 and nothing about this current release is rushed or hurried by any means. While 'With Teeth' had more of a live feel, 'Year Zero' takes us back to Trent Reznors trademark sound and the root of Nine Inch Nails with the Industrial sound that they are so well known for. While this CD is very Industrial sounding it also is very loud with a lot of guitar. Trents vocals are great!<br /><br />The concept of the album is great as well. Having a very futuristic feel/vibe/meaning to it. Basically when the world hits its breaking point and all things come crashing down.  Hitting such topics as greed, power, politics, war with Trents (at times) whispery voice that then turns into the full blown scream.  GENIUS!  Every song on here stands out.<br /><br />This CD is a must. One of the best!!!!!
B000NNZUV8|4.0|Arthur Grumiaux was one of the great violinists of the late 20th century.  Most of his stereo recordings are for Philips, and he recorded the Beethoven Violin Concerto twice:  once with Alceo Galliera/Philharmonia Orchestra (Philips \\"Concert Classics\\"), and later with Colin Davis/Concertgebouw Orchestra (Pentatone SACD).  Grumiaux is authoritative in Beethoven, in a more slender, Classical way than some his colleagues: Oistrakh, Heifetz, Stern, Menuhin or Francescatti.<br /><br />Clara Haskil is one of the great pianists of the late 20th century, and her recordings of Mozart and Beethoven are highly prized by collectors.  She recorded mostly for Philips, but has some DG recordings in the catalog: Mozart Piano Concertos spring to mind.<br /><br />Grumiaux and Haskil were a great team and made wonderful music together.  Their precision and teamwork is wonderful: dovetailing one another, and performing as one, not as soloist/accompanist.  Beethoven's Violin Sonatas are SONATAS FOR VIOLIN AND PIANO, with the two instruments as EQUAL PARTNERS, not soloist/accompanist.<br /><br />The recording, however, if a bit boomy, and sometimes the violin seems too close: higher passages sound harsh and too aggressive.  In these passages, the piano seems a little recessed.  Brilliant Classics lists the recordings as \\"licensed from Decca\\" and \\"recorded 1956/57\\".  Brilliant does not say, but these sound like mono recordings, and my overall impression is a little flat and neutral.  However, the ear adjusts, and if you have an equalizer (I do not) - you can make the needed frequency range corrections.<br /><br />I picked this up for under $20 from an English firm;  you might consider this route rather than the higher US price.  Recommended in spite of my reservations about the sound.
B00007AJF8|5.0|\\"Being John Malkovich\\" (1999), the Spike Jonze's directorial debut, is an amazing film - hip, inventive, delightfully weird, incredibly funny and disturbingly serious with the gleefully absurd plot twists. Let's face it, that was a stroke of genius - to throw together the tragic medieval lovers, Abelard and Heloise in the street show created by a talented puppeteer Craig Scwartzh (John Cusack) with the nimble fingers but out of work in \\"today's wintry economic climate\\", Elijah the Chimp with the mental problems that go back to his childhood, the surreal office that is located on the 7 1/2 store of a New York City office building and a floor is four feet high. Add Cameron Diaz (Craig's animals loving wife Lotte), completely unrecognizable, aging and balding Charlie Sheen, cynical and practical Maxine (Catherine Keener), who had an unique experience of having two people looked at her \\"with complete lust and devotion, through the same pair of eyes\\", and send them all to the wild ride inside the famous and respectable actor John Malkovich's brain to see what he sees and to feel what he feels, to the trip that would last 15 minutes and end up in a ditch on the side of New Jersey Turnpike. This is just the beginning...Oh, and what John Horatio Malkovich feels with all the travelers in his head and what he sees when he enters the portal to his own brain, you have to find out for yourself! What drug were Charlie Kaufman and Spike Jonze on?! Not even two hours long, the movie never ceases to surprise and entertain. \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is a fascinating and truly original film which I love and always enjoy watching even if there were never a connection with any of its characters (with the exception of Abelard and Heloise and Elijah the Chimp).
B000FWHVKA|5.0|I'm still suprised to see that so many in the indie scene had the sense to so highly rate an electronic album such as this one.<br /><br />A inventive electro album that thankfully as a unique sound (as so few electro albums sometimes have), you can see why the good ears of Mute Records picked up on this mysterious sibling Sweedish duo act.<br /><br />\\"We share our mothers health\\" became one of the most bizarrely catchy singles of the year, with a awesome music video to go along with it, if you are in any doubt of buying this album, I recomend checking out the video on youtube, it will convert you.<br /><br />Overall, the album is dark, filled with chilling background synths layered with wonderfully sharp keyboard lines and bass that makes even the most introverted start doing some foot tapping make it where you can't ignore this disc.  The very avant garde vocal style is somehow still very accessable.  The production is damn fine as well.  This is most defintively not only a album that you will want to have on the dancefloor, but one that will make for a good time while on the headphones at home.  The duo will have a hard time topping this one, however with this quality of album work they are sure to have a good career ahead of them if they can keep it up.
B0009A40ES|4.0|While I believe that the book is masterfully written, I kept asking myself when I was reading it whether Ellis had a deal with the Devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever.<br /><br />It is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them, see them, almost touch them, they practically scream at you from the pages; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage.<br /><br />I did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book; To admire it, to respect it - yes but to enjoy it...<br /><br />Well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked. She cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire. I liked the film when I saw it first time; I love it now after the second viewing. Surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards.<br /><br />The show belongs to Christian Bale - and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character. Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting. His James Bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly, that your blood would freeze.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|People rave about this being a latter-day masterpiece for Neil; sadly, while it's a good album, it falls far short of his true masterpieces, and it doesn't quite reach the level of Harvest Moon. The words no longer seem to flow from the heart, but from the mind, and there's a certain sameness to the sound that belies an awkward self-awareness. Still, Neil the chameleon deserves a lot of credit, even if he's not reinventing but revisiting.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Backpacking through Europe in search of adventure is somewhat of a rite of passage for many American young adults, and Hostel takes you right along for the ride!  Join friends Paxton and Josh as they travel through Europe, and join up with fellow traveler Oli, an Icelander with a thirst for action.<br /><br />Much in the tradition of classic films such as Eurotrip, Hostel shows young people looking for excitement and romance as they tromp through Paris, Belgium, Amsterdam, and beyond.  Their adventures take them to a mysterious hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia - a city known for its friendly people - where they discover a secret, underground club that is members only.<br /><br />Oli and Josh wind up getting involved with some of this elite club's members and wind up deciding to spend the rest of their lives in Bratislava, but Paxton, turned off by the exclusivity and backstabbing nature of the club's members, decides to take off for more adventure.  He leaves Bratislava with a one-eyed girl that he meets, though they part ways in a touching scene at the train station.
B000O178BY|4.0|As fresh a concept as \\"Year Zero\\" is (and I won't delve into that since you already know about the guerilla marketing campaign and all of the gamer aesthetics involved herein), it's astounding that we as discerning listeners still allow Trent Reznor to unleash his barrage of nihilistic, cathartic, and sometimes self-loathing compositions upon us after nearly 20 years.  Chalk it up to teenage nostalgia or to rabid fanaticism.  Or just maybe, despite all of the \\"hell in a hand basket\\" productions of the post 9/11 world, NIN's newest music has an urgency that begs listening and demands attention.<br /><br />The album is as bleak and foreboding as it has been advertised.  Living in a near apocalyptic 2022 that's being crushed under its own religious and political weight, the lyrical content of \\"Year Zero\\" reflects the musings felt by so many people of what it feels like to be living the American dream in 2007.  The overtones here are cynical, ashamed, and hopeless, much like those of any other NIN album.  But in this context, the darkness within rings with profound meaning.  What would read like cliche alt-rock material in the late 90's (the resistance movement in \\"Survivalism\\") now stands up as relevant.  What could be passed off as another take on Bush bashing (see \\"Capital G\\") really exploits the dangers of merging church and state.<br /><br />But the lyrics pale in comparison to the effect of Reznor's studio wizardry (or is it laptop skills?) and insatiable love of sonic textures.  While it could be argued that his Pro Tools loving trigger finger got a little too crazy with the drum machine patches, no one can argue Reznor's ability to build swirling and chaotic layers of sounds into some of the most simultaneously abrasive and catchy songs of the year.  \\"My Violent Heart\\" stands out in this regard.  \\"God Given\\" is downright danceable.  \\"The Great Destroyer\\" nears caves in under its own weight as Reznor indulges in the glitchy and skittering beats that envelope the song's latter half.  These songs will irritate just as much as they will make you shake your hips and hum along with the melody.<br /><br />\\"Zero Sum\\", which closes out the album in grand NIN fashion, sums up the whole aura of this project rather succinctly as the fragile tones of a piano echo in the background: \\"May God have mercy on our dirty little souls.\\"  This isn't just your standard pity parade....it's a call to arms, and Reznor's made the call that much more explicit.the song's latter half.

B000KGGLCU|5.0|I've seen Madonna's concerts over the past 20-plus years, and this woman can still dazzle the audience with her elaborate production numbers while making it look better than she did when she was in her 20's. Unlike most singers of today, Madonna has a greater challenge because her music isn't timeless. When listening to a lot of her 80's albums, some of the music sounds dated. And it would still sound dated if she hadn't put a new spin on them. The fabulous \\"older\\" songs such as \\"La Isla Bonita,\\" \\"Erotic\\" and even 2000's \\"Music\\" sounded incredibly fresh because the original backing tracks were replaced with a techno backdrop of music that was alive for 2006. The two most outstanding and profoundly touching performances were \\"Live To Tell\\" and \\"Forbidden Love.\\" Madonna presented the images of twelve million children in Africa that have been orphaned due to AIDS. The way she incorporated religion as well as same sex partners during \\"Forbidden Love\\" really touched my heart. Madonna had me in the palm of her hand as I found myself transfixed to the visuals, as well as her own divine way of taking over a stage and a venue of thousands of fans. The use of the '76 Trammps staple \\"Disco Inferno\\" was brilliantly executed to introduce the last act of \\"disco/dance\\" songs that she performed. As usual, Madonna is always one step ahead. What's even more amazing about her performance is the fact that she was in terrible pain throughout the entire tour because her collarbone had not completely healed from her horse riding accident last year. She refused to cut her dance numbers and went out there like a trouper.<br /><br />For those of you who watched this concert when it aired on network television, you were denied Madonna's \\"controversial\\" segment when she hung on the mirrored Cross while singing \\"Like A Prayer,\\" as well as several other songs that round out this two hour concert. If this country can tolerate an unnecessary war in Iraq but needs to shield their eyes to a woman performing her art onstage, then we're a lot worse off than we even imagined. Unfortunately, this isn't anything new or earth shattering. It's just a sad statement on the climate of this country. But controversy (as mild as this was) is Madonna's friend and has always been consistent in her career. Happily, other songs that were edited down and abbreviated for television have been restored to their full glory on this DVD.<br /><br />After watching Madonna's latest live concert special, one word came to my mind - brilliant!<br /><br />I feel confident that this latest concert event, which aired on NBC last November, will be nominated for an Emmy. Whether she wins or not depends on the competition. Well done, Madonna.performing her art onstage, then we're a lot worse off than we even imagined.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|I saw Children of Men on DVD and granted, I wanted to like it. I was looking for a gritty, speculative fiction piece which would scare the crap out of my intellectual mind. Children of Men was just that! The story was terrifying; the idea that women the world over could be infertile and what would become of man as it's children ceased to exist was chillingly portrayed by the desperate, hopeless, and desolate characters in their squalid setting. A setting not entirely \\"post-apocalyptic,\\" but degraded to the point of gray sameness, without ambition and punctuated by war, criminal immigration, nuclear fallout, and unchecked terrorism. The protagonist, Theo Faron, is our slightly dingy window into this world. He is himself without hope or ambition, gray in his dress and demeanor, and the unlikely hero. Played with impeccable realism and empathy by Clive Owen, Theo is bitterly cynical and tinged with a sadness that is clearly an endless cycle of self loathing and self-pity. When Julian Taylor (actress Julianne Moore), an old lover, re-enters his life with an unexpected proposition, Theo shows his first signs of \\"character\\" when he eventually accepts.<br /><br />The journey that Theo undertakes to lead the world's only pregnant woman to safety is both physical and metaphorical. What I really liked about both journeys is their credibility. The movie supports the characters in every detail, from dialogue to set design to costume and even editing. This goes a long way toward creating the world that science fiction fans so long to see fully realized on the big screen. Then we can give ourselves over to the characterizations (brilliantly played by all the principles in this film) as they walk us through this harrowing \\"what if\\". Theo's often clumsy guardianship is heartbreaking; he's not an action hero, he's us and we cringe at his inelegant approach to fulfilling his duty. At one point he loses his shoes, forcing him to make an escape in borrowed flip flops. This suggestion of Theo's emotional nakedness is intended, I think, to make us uncomfortable, even embarrassed. But it also highlights that every step he takes thereafter is one of deliberate courage, a conscious decision to give himself over to hope.<br /><br />What this movie does not do is degrade into banal religious metaphors along the lines of the second coming, or suggest that women's infertility is in any way a punishment from god or nature. Although the characters briefly discuss those themes, this movie never becomes a \\"cautionary tale\\" geared towards getting us to recycle or go to church. In the face of all the wretchedness that human nature can dish out, Children of Men asks \\"what if\\" a man never gives up? Then suggests; it would save mankind.n of Theo's emotional nakedness is intended, I think, to make us uncomfortable, even embarrassed.

0684830515|5.0|This is a spectacular piece of work.  Written by any other author, this would still be a great work, but Hemingway's command of language is astounding.  His prose is so beautiful and bracing and elegant - it defies adequate description.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised (ecstatic really) when I saw this box set for the first time. It is wonderfully packaged - very original. It is not overly large like others I have purchased before and the red box is a real stand out. The booklet is very informative - full of images from the TV series. Though it is not broken down into each series like the original Friends Boxset I haven't had any trouble navigating around the series by using the booklet. Would definitely recommend this to any Friends fan.
B00006L3S3|3.0|This mediocre but likable record by my favorite artist illustrates pretty handily the production crisis Lennon fell into after the 'Imagine' album, and which he never really got himself out of. On 'Plastic Ono Band' and 'Imagine' he conjured up a powerful, proto-grunge sound for the rock numbers and, for the ballads, an extremely effective conservatory-hall austerity. One wonders why he would ever trade this in for what came later. His rock'n'roll grew denser but more conventional; his ballads grew sweeter, slicker. Lennon's mid-70s albums verge on sounding producty.  <br /> <br />But then, years after his death, albums like 'Menlove Ave.' and the 'Anthology' boxed set--as well as the bonus tracks on reissues like this one--began showing up. And they demonstrated a rather startling fact: after 1971, nearly every one of Lennon's songs sounds better as an alternate take or in demo form than it did as an official release. In the cases of some songs--like \\"One Day at a Time\\" and \\"Bring on the Lucie,\\" not to mention a good half of 'Walls and Bridges'--the improvements are revelatory.  <br /> <br />Of course, the subpar quality of 'Mind Games' and its immediate follow-ups is not entirely a matter of production. The ideas here are not as urgent as they were a few years earlier, after the trauma of the Beatles' breakup and the ecstasy of John's immersion in Yoko, so the lyrics are a touch more vague, sometimes a bit rote (this album includes his worst-ever couplet, \\"Like a UFO you came to me/And blew away life's misery\\"-- now there's a mid-70s line for you).  <br /> <br />But, as always, this most serious of artists was searching. There's no shame in \\"failures\\" such as this album. (And there are at least two songs that require no apology--the soaring title track and the great-in-any-form \\"Meat City.\\")
B000NA1OXY|5.0|no doubt this album is a party album. if your looking for songs like \\"Dont tell me\\" & \\"my happy ending\\" then you wont be satisfied with this album. But nevertheless its definitly worth listining to. Avrils spontanious lyrics apear just as often as in the first Cd \\"let go\\". If you enjoyed her more upbeat songs then youll love this album. shes experimenting and it turned out pretty well. if you love the song girlfriend then you most definitly will like the rest of the songs. i do believe her second album showed more of her musically but this album is ANYTHING BUT A FLOP.
B000000WHX|5.0|There is nothing much left to say about Massive Attack's masterpiece of \\"trip-hop\\" that is Blue Lines. <br /> <br />Tricky's raps are classy and smart and the warm synth work is both inspiring and brilliant. The deep dub-like bass grooves on this album are legendary. \\"Unfinished Symphony\\" is a soulful pop masterpiece.  This album is displayed prominently on my CD rack. <br /> <br />Ok, I will stop the praise..only if you buy this album now.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I have yet to get this movie on DVD, but I have it on VHS. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I actually know most if not all the lines in the movie. <br /> <br />Bruce Bugtrotter was one of my favorite characters in the film. I love the cake scene in the audutoriam(sp). I love when he told trunchbull that his moms cake was better. \\"How can you be sure, unless you have another bite.\\" Lol it's a laughable feelgood fun movie. <br />This is a movie for all ages. <br />Danny Devito and his wife Rhea Pearlman are really funny this movie. they work well together.
B000000YG5|5.0|Look at the reviews of this CD...a heavy-metal fan turned onto jazz (at least in part) by this album.  Someone realizing that rating this CD is like rating the Mona Lisa. - And with >70 reviews this CD still has a perfect 5 stars. - Yes, the music really is that good.  The rendition of \\"Moritat\\" is by itself enough to justify buying the CD.  I am adding my two cents here only to help keep the reviews recent and to let potential buyers know that this music is [still] amazing and it really is worth your hard-earned money.

B000068TPN|5.0|This is an outstanding movie.  The film's primary focus is on the character and strength of the men and women who serve our country.  In this movie, all of the in-uniform personnel were men; however, the film does a very good job showing that spouses/wives also serve.  In addition, the film does a good job showing the strengths and weaknesses (i.e. - the reality) of the military.  As with all movies, I suggest you rent first and then buy if you like.  For me, this movie is one of a very few that has been worth the purchase.
0440178002|5.0|I loved this book! Do not let the length of the book scare you.  Once you get into it the plot will intrigue you and the pages will fly by. The best way I can describe this book is by comparing it to the reality show \\"Survivor.\\" It is like an entire series of that show, with the characters making deals, pretending to be loyal, and backstabbing just trying to find ways to survive another day. There is also a nice romantic love story mixed in among all the action. The characters are very real and you learn to love and/or hate them throughout the book.     I also found it very intersting to learn about the Japanese culture. One that still exists today.    One quick piece of advice: Use a bookmark and on it write down the characters, their loyalties, spouses, family, etc.  This can be an overwhelming book because there are a lot of characters.  I found myself having to search backwards in the text to find out who was loyal to who, who was related to who, etc. I think you will enjoy and get more out of this book if you take a few notes along the way.  But please, don't let this keep you from reading the book.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I'm really surprised with this album. First let me say if you're expecting another Let Go or Under My Skin, this isn't for you. But if you loved Sk8er Boi & He Wasn't off of those albums, you'll LOVE this album. It's full of spunk & personality. It's so much fun. It's definetly Avril at her best. Plus she throws in a few ballads with beautiful lyrics to balance the record out.<br /><br />The best songs IMO are Runaway, When You're Gone, Hot, Innocence & Keep Holding On. But the rest all are GREAT songs. I've listened to the album over & over, never skipping a track. This is definetly hands down one of the best albums yet of 2007. If you want something fun to rock out to & dance to while you're driving or getting ready to go out with your friends or even partying, this is the CD for you!!<br /><br />Avril is looking the best she ever has & her personality & attitude shine through on every song on this record. \\"Girlfriend\\" is so much fun & it's currently #3 in the country!! Next up...\\"When You're Gone\\". This is one of her best songs EVER in my opinion. She sings \\"When you're gone, the pieces of my heart are missing you & the face I came to know is missing too...\\" Amazing!!<br /><br />So I reccomend this for anyone that loves fun pop/punk that you can dance to & songs that you can relate to. Also, if you don't want the edited version, you need to buy the Deluxe Edition. The regular edition is edited.<br /><br />~Blake~
B000A6T1JU|4.0|The Warriors is a \\"night in the life of\\" movie about the life of a New York City street gang.  One gang leader calls on all the rival gangs to set aside their turf battles and unite against the police force.  During his eloquent raised-platform speech in the opening sequence of the movie, a drugged-up street punk assassinates him, and points the blame at The Warriors, our hero street gang.  A melee ensures, and the Warriors need to make it home to Coney Island without getting assaulted by the cops or their rivals.<br /><br />There isn't much else to the plot of this movie (in fact, the viewer is never sure of the assassin's motivations, other than surmising that he's a punk who has nothing better to do than cause trouble).  Visually, however, The Warriors is a cinematic experience.  Each gang is color coded in their own street uniform--baseball gear with face paint, denim overalls, purple satin with matching hats, a mime group, and so on.  The Warriors is representative of a video game a full decade before the explosion of video games (and it was recently turned into a video game by Rockstar Games).  The various teams are color coded, they get power ups and additional weapons by battling their enemies, and they need to complete a quest without getting killed by the enemy.<br /><br />Director Walter Hill opens his Director's Cut with an apology for over-the-top director's editions.  He reveals that he did only minor edits to his new version, cleaning up the editing and using comic book transitions between the scenes.  The comic book transitions are seamless and fit well within the architecture of the movie.
B000J103YI|1.0|Maybe many of the reviewers can not remember the original soundtrack with Jennifer Holiday. I certainly can and each time that I hear Ms. Hudson's version of \\"I am telling you\\", I have to turn the radio off because it is so bad. There is no comparison between the versions. It reminds me of  Jay Anthony Brown (Tom Joyner Morning Show) murdering another hit. That is exactly what Ms. Hudson did. She murdered a classic hit. <br /> <br />But I can not totally blame her because like other young artists, she is missing the true talent that her predecessors possesed. Aretha, Gladys, Minnie, Roberta, Whitney, Jean Carne, Melba.... <br />These young ladies today are more hype than talent. I truly feel sorry for this generation.
B00065MDS6|5.0|This 1970 release was created in-between the brilliant 1969 debut (In the Court of the Crimson King) and the staggering virtuosity and general \\"wildness\\" of the 1973-1975 incarnation of King Crimson (Larks Tongues in Aspic; Starless and Bible Black, and Red).  Although some fans and critics regard Lizard as a weaker album (and even hard to \\"get into\\"), I personally feel that the music is excellent and shows a great deal of compositional sophistication (classical influences figure prominently).  Pete Sinfield even turned the heat up on his lyrics and they are very elaborate and complex on Lizard.  Come to think of it, the album stands among some of my favorite King Crimson albums.<br /><br />The core lineup on Lizard included: Robert Fripp (acoustic and electric guitars, mellotron, electric keyboards & devices); Mel Collins (flute & saxophones); Gordon Haskell (bass guitar & vocals); Andy McCulloch (drums and percussion); and Peter Sinfield (words & pictures; VCS3 synthesizer).  Additional musicians include: Robin Miller (oboe & cor anglais); Mark Charig (cornet); Nick Evans (trombone); Keith Tippet (piano & electric piano); and finally Jon Anderson of Yes fame (vocals on \\"Prince Rupert Awakes\\").  In terms of musicianship, Robert Fripp and excellent drummer Andy McCulloch are the true standouts here, although the supporting brass and woodwind players turn in some excellent ensemble work (especially on the track Bolero).  Bassist/vocalist Gordon Haskell (who was apparently a fan of soul and Motown music) was either reluctant (or unable) to embrace the complex material on Lizard and it shows in his bass playing, which is fairly weak throughout (his vocals may be an acquired taste for some - although I like them a lot).  Following the release of the Lizard album, Haskell left the band (along with McCulloch).<br /><br />The five tracks on the album range in length from 2'47\\" (the delicate Lady of the Dancing water) to the massive (23'15\\"), seven-part Lizard suite, which would prove to be the largest piece that the band would ever compose.  Musically, Lizard presents a nice mixture of symphonic prog, the avant-garde, and even some highly experimental, jazz-inflected moments here and there (apparently a Miles Davis influence), although it is extremely odd-sounding and angular jazz.  Pieces that are good examples of the avant-garde aspects include Happy Family, which features Tippetts' insane pounding on the piano.  Although there are some hectic and aggressive moments on the album, in large part it is quiet and even reflective at points. Lady of the Dancing Water is the most soft and pastoral piece on the album, and features some excellent flute playing by Mel Collins.<br /><br />Other personal favorites include Cirkus (love the mellotron), Indoor Games, and the huge Lizard suite.  The suite opens with the very delicate and pastoral Prince Rupert Awakes movement and features the high pitched and soft vocals of Jon Anderson.  His vocals work perfectly with this track. Bolero (the second movement in the Lizard suite) is another favorite and is a virtual showcase for supporting musicians Tippett, Miller, Charig, and Evans.  The Lizard suite goes through a number of twists and turns, ranging from the delicate to the all out instrumental chaos of The Battle of Glass Tears/Last Skirmish.  The piece closes some 23 minutes later with Big Top, which consists of carnival music, sped up and otherwise distorted (very creepy sounding stuff).<br /><br />All in all this is a very progressive and challenging album by King Crimson and is a personal favorite from the 1970 -1972 period.  Very highly recommended along with the 1969 debut, Larks Tongues in Aspic (1973), and Red (1974).to be the largest piece that the band would ever compose.

B000G7599Y|5.0|For a while I liked Neville Marriner's set, but I ended up growing tired of it. His performances tend to be missing an element of Viennese stateliness that is so important when performing these works. Conversely, this set has Karl Bohm, one of the 20th century's greatest Mozart conductors, conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. Here, we have that stateliness in spades. Bohm coaxes lush string sonorities out of the BPO, conducts with clarity and precision (thus leaving Mozart's dense counterpoint exposed for the listener), and really does an excellent job with tempi. Bohm is often criticized for his sometimes slower pace, however I don't see that problem here. His tempo choices for Mozart tend to fall somewhere in the middle, and oftentimes they sound just right. His 39th is my all-time favorite rendition, with a grandly symphonic tilt on the slow introduction and a lively, aristocratic allegro following; in general he is amongst my top choices for all of Mozart's most important symphonies (25, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35-41). Keep in mind, this is old-school \\"big-band\\" Mozart, not the lean, quick style used by many modern conductors of these works...so if your taste falls towards period performances, you may want to look elsewhere. For my taste, Mozart is even more enjoyable when given some time to breathe, and these performances certainly do that (the best example of this would be his unhurried, gorgeous rendition of No. 29). Bohm does omit exposition repeats, for those that care.<br /><br />The sound is absolutely fantastic, as DG applied its Original Image Bit-Processing technique to all of these symphonies. The result is a resurrected sound, with great definition and presence, if slightly distantly recorded. It's hard to believe these were recorded 40+ years ago, as the recordings really sound almost brand-new.<br /><br />Really, for the money, this is probably the best value out there. I also enjoyed Mackerras' readings with the Prague Chamber Orchestra, and the aforementioned Marriner set. Still, this is a set I will definitely be coming back to over and over again. Bohm fans should keep an eye out, as DG has been releasing re-mastered editions of a lot of Bohm's Mozart, including the Sinfonia Concertante (with VPO principals as soloists), the Concerto for 2 pianos & Concerto No. 27 (with Gilels and his daughter), his readings of concertos for flute, bassoon and the great clarinet concerto, and his 2fer package with Eine Kleine Nachmusik, divertimenti, and assorted Serenades (notturna, haffner, posthorn). Fans of this style of Mozart ought to snap all of this up, as his Mozart readings are always worthwhile.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|I read several reviewers who praised the intrigue and \\"inter-connectedness\\" of the stories in the movie, but in reality, only 3 stories are really connected.  The first act of the chain is really not the American getting shot, but the gun having been given and sold.  Not sure how the Japanese family is related since the gun giving had nothing to do with his wife's death (he gave the gun as gratitude to his guide on his hunt) nor his daughter's sadness over being rejected as a deaf-mute.  The gun itself starts a chain of events that are indeed connected, so that's 3 stories:  Gun to shepard/sons who shoots American couple that prevented their relatives from reliefing the Mexican nanny so she took their kids to Mexico so she could attend her son's wedding and getting caught at the border, etc.  Confusion is interpreted as \\"art\\" by critics, I've noticed, and there are certainly confusing parts in this movie...the ending is unclear, and not sure why the nanny couldn't explain her role at the border, and what happened to the kids.
B000O178BY|3.0|Yeow, what a disappointment! Don't believe the hype. This album is stereotypical Trent at his most uninteresting. Most of the songs draw a direct line back to songs from previous albums. One thing about his own description of the album is correct: it's certainly very dancable. Sure, Trent lays down some good, funky techno rhythms, mostly hearkening back to Broken's \\"Suck.\\" But beyond that, the lyrics, melodies and harmonies are weak. You could call this album a bunch of outtakes from With_Teeth. Or you could call it a bad Marilyn Manson album.<br /><br />There is little of lasting interest here. I enjoy \\"Survivalism,\\" \\"Vessel,\\" and \\"Capital G.\\" That last one is a cynical and juvenile swipe at Bush and conservatism, but I enjoy it as a guilty pleasure. Trent puts forth his message ineffectively. We're doomed by our greed, disregard for the planet, and religious sheepherding. You've got a typical NIN album when you combine it with Trent's innate inability to connect with other people (That happens when you have Asperger's Syndrome. Yes, he's an Aspie, though no one will tell him).<br /><br />Oh, well. Once again, maybe next time ....

It also gives a little bit of history as to how these individuals achieved their ultimate goal of becoming wealthy and successful...in a good way.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|When my friend and I were bored one night, we decided to watch The Good Shepherd on DVD.  My friend saw it in theaters and said it was a waste of money (4 months ago).  I knew it was boring, everyone said so, but still, I wanted to give it a chance.  He also wanted to give it another chance.  Well, that wasnt the case.  I had to leave in the first 20 minutes because it was that bad.  The only reason he wanted me to see it cause he wanted me to suffer through it like him.  HAH! Well I knew better.  I came back for the last 15 minutes of the movie (it was still on).  I didnt understand what happened, but had I watched it through, I still wouldntve understood.  Haha, my friend was so mad at me for not having to watch it.  <br /> <br />Watching this movie is like being shot with a tranquilizer.  You better escape before it gets to you.
B000NA77YO|5.0|Thunderous riffage and the roaring \\"TUR-R-R-N UP THE NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!\\" introduced me to Dio era of Black Sabbath.  This Sabbath had it all: superb musicians, a frontman with unbelievable technical ability and charismatic presence, an in-your-face \\"chemistry\\" that kicked your ass right from the first notes... They had the balls-to- the-wall approach that was lacking on last releases with Ozzy. Never before have I heard all the instruments including the bass and drums so clearly presented as on the Heaven and Hell and the Mob Rules. For the first time there were actual ballads on Sabbath records - with epic vibe and beautiful singing. While Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules were built from similar ingredients they are actually quite different. The first album of Dio-fronted Sabbath crashed on the fans like sharp and clear-cut explosion. Mob Rules was a heavier and gloomier attempt. When accomplished the Mob Rules tour documented in the Live Evil album, the band had split.<br />  The uniqueness of the Dio-Iommi-Butler-Appice combination inspired the recording of the Dehumanizer album. This one was the heaviest of Sabbath releases with Dio (if not in all Sabbath history). However, in the following tour the egos clashed once more and the band split again. Last of the official Sabbath albums arrived, (the Forbidden) after which the reunion with Ozzy ended the revolving line-up policy. Although the fans enthusiastically met this, the reunion did not renew the band but led to series of reunion tours with Greatest Hits set. Completely understandable are the repeated attempts of Tony Iommi to launch solo career (also with the former bandmate Glenn Hughes). An unexpected turn however was the arrival of Dio-era Best Of compilation and tour of reunited Mob Rules line-up to promote the release.<br />  The compilation aims to highlight the best in Dio-era Sabbath releases and while the list is slightly different for every fan, three aims are marked as achievements in my book:<br /><br />i). There are three new songs proving this line-up is able to produce new music;<br />ii) The band is actually touring (although I personally most likely won't see them);<br />iii) This hopefully will kick Ozzy and $haron's a$$e$.<br /><br />(...)here are three new songs proving this line-up is able to produce new music;  ii) The band is actually touring (although I personally most likely won't see them);  iii) This hopefully will kick Ozzy and $haron's a$$e$.

B000NA1OXY|5.0|I thought that The Best Damn Thing would actually be The Worst Damn Thing. It turns out I really like it. I thought this cd would be so bad but it turned out to be one of my favorites. I will admit that it's not the best damn thing from Avril but it comes pretty close. I only think that Avril picked the wrong song as her first single from the album. To me Girlfriend was the worst song on the cd. Avril Lavigne definately did not lose me as a BIG fan! This album is definately worth buying!!
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I liked RENT, But then again I only saw it once, except when I watch the beginning when they sing Seasons of change. Angel was so cute, you know the guy who played angel anyways. But in all it was a great movie that made me cry a whole lot.
0316172324|4.0|While it's not the same idea as The Tipping Point, it's a similarly interesting one, and leave it to Gladwell to pull together the most wide-ranging variety of examples to make his points come to life. <br /> <br />Whether it's art fraud, the Coke/Pepsi taste test or a $250 million war game exercise where a rogue Arab state (played by a retired general) sank our Persian Gulf fleet using fishing boats and Cessnas, it makes for some damn fine reading. <br /> <br />Of particular fascination was the opening segment about how researchers were able to observe couples interacting and based on watching just minutes of footage could tell you with amazing accuracy whether they would still be together seven years from now. <br /> <br />It's an excellent book that takes aim at overly-cautious, committeed-to-death, CYA decision making.  It's not advocating snap judgements (not the same thing)... you'll see if you read it. <br /> <br />Definitely a pass-around book once you've finished it, as The Tipping Point was.  Not too long, quick read... a few slower passages here and there but all in all it breezes by.
B00000099Y|5.0|It's all been said before, this is a classic and masterpiece as far as this genre of music is concerned. One of my top 10 albums of all time. Great production, excellent musicians who actually know how to play their instruments and get the most out of studio equipment. If you haven't heard this get it now.  <br /> <br />And to the 1 star guy complaining about \\"I get to hear the F word a zillion times\\" oh NO!! Check out The Wiggles they're probably more your speed.
B000O178BY|3.0|I've read many reviews and find it is rediculous to me that many people said that this album contains many new sounds.  Please if you are nin fan but never heard anything from 'Autechre' (try 'Confield'album which release 6 years ago !!), 'Aphex twin' or even 'Squarepusher' (I'd recommend 'Go plastic' album 5 years ago) then you will know how old of the sound of year zero are.  Believe me i love nin but i just don't understand why trent cannot go further than this ?! since he were an only extreme advance music creative during early 90's. You may also try 'Sigur ros' (try album ( )) if you want something really new,dark mood with bright future of music creative.
B000N3SS80|5.0|Firstly, I absolutely adore this CD!!! While I was nervous about J-Lo putting out a totally spanish CD as I've been a big fan of her English music, the melodies on this CD are so great that it doesn't matter that it's in Spanish at all! I think she's never sounded better and \\"Que Hiciste\\" is definitely one of her best songs ever (The video is even hotter!) and all the tracks continue in that fashion! <br /> <br />Get this CD asap!!
B000000W5N|4.0|\\"Sticky Fingers\\" isnt just a great Stones album, but a great classic rock album as well. The only thing that I have to debate about this album is that I dont think its the best Stones record. The honor would have to go to \\"Let it Bleed\\" Now, I am in no way comparing this to \\"Let it Bleed\\" because that just wouldn't be fair, since every song on \\"Let it Bleed\\" is excellent, which makes it an easy five star effort. The reason I give this only four  stars is that is falls just a bit short from perfect. I feel when you are reviewing Stones albums from this time frame, that you have to be a little more judgemental, since the late 60's/ all 70's time frame was the best for the band. They even had some early 80's solid albums, but no where near the musical effort as the earlier stuff. \\"Sticky Fingers\\" seems to fall a bit short with \\"You gotta move\\", and \\"Dead Flowers\\" which in my opinion seem to be blues songs that are forced, instead of the blues infused \\"Sister Morphine\\" , and \\"Moonlight Mile\\" which the band seems to flow more gracefully. I am sure there will be some that love those songs, but I feel that they are just a bit overdone, and they just arent very solid songs, if that makes any sense. Its still a great record from the Stones, but I feel that it just isn't pefect, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be in everyone's CD collection. ENJOY!
B00030DEQE|5.0|Intel Pro 1000 desktop adapters work with Linux straight out of the box.  You plug it in the PCI card slot inside the computer case and it will automatically be recognized by the Linux Kernel on boot, and configured as eth0.  On the downside, with Microsoft Windows XP you need to install drivers.  I wasn't surprised when I had to change my router (switch) to be gigabit compatible, and all the other machines needed gigabit cards, which they all had already, to get a gigabit network.  Gigabit is 1000 base T, or ten times the speed of 100 base T, the current world standard.  Intel makes great equipment, and most of it works with Linux.  I don't endorse any operating systems, as this is a personal preference.  I only think people should know the truth.
B000O176Q6|5.0|I recently purchased a Playstation 3 and an HD LCD TV, and this is the first Blu-Ray disc that i have bought. Ive seen this movie dozens of times on TV, VHS and DVD and i thought i knew every fight scene back to front. Since seeing it today, i discovered how much i was missing in those old video formats. There really is that much more detail and smoothness in the images. Its a great showing for a 30yo movie. There is also a great deal of documentaries and extras if you dig that kind of stuff.    As for the movie itself...its a classic action movie with fantastic fight scenes, a convincing bad guy, funny bits, armies of dumb henchmen, hot chicks and Bruce Lee in his prime! What more could an action film lover want?
0385333846|5.0|Sandwiched between two of the \\"boomer\\" generation's biggest hit movies, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" and \\"The Sting,\\" the director of those, George Roy Hill, found time to make the film version of \\"Slaughterhouse Five.\\" It became one of my favorite films over time.  Yet I had never read anything by Vonnegut. With the advent of his death, I figured it was finally time. I enjoyed the book but am happy I saw the movie first.   <br /> <br />The story revolves around a man who does not live his life in a normal aging sequence but instead, thanks in part to some strange extraterrestrials,  lives by being \\"unstuck in time;\\" he jumps randomly from time period to time period. So, like the movie \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" we get a current event and go into the past to undertstand how he got there or we see the past and eventually it ties into the present.        <br /> <br />I believe the film captures the spirit of the book very well yet there are enough differences between the two for me to be very satisfied with both. The parts that differ from the movie really added to my enjoyment. The novel also alerts you to the fact that some of the action may have been taken directly from Vonnegut's life and the message Vonnegut was trying to get across is maybe a bit clearer than the movie can make it.  <br /> <br />Funny, I am not sure I would have enjoyed the book without seeing the movie. Why? Well, I am not a big fantasy/sci-fi reader so it is quite possible the subject would have been difficult for me to embrace. I am not sure I would have \\"gotten it\\" without the film to provide the framework. I could also visualize the characters and their predicaments with the film to fall back on.  <br /> <br />So my overall point is that this is a book you should enjoy immensely if you have seen the movie.  Of course, I can't tell you otherwise.  <br /> <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|It's very rare that a CD nowadays gets me excited, but NIN has done the job with Year Zero. I've listened to it several times, and I still hear something different each time. It's got Quality and Quantity both musically and lyrically. Trent Reznor has a way of matching his words with his music, so you can really feel what the message is. I strongly recommend this CD and I guarantee it will spend a long time in your CD player before you even get the urge to find something else.
B00005JMUA|5.0|i tend to bounce back-and-forth in my mind as to which half of the \\"kill bill\\" story i like better. as of writing this review, i'm going to have to go with \\"vol. 2\\", perhaps just because it's the one i've seen more recently, but i'm thinking there's more to it than that, so i'll try to get to those points instead.     first off, this really is like splitting hairs, picking which volume is better. now, believe all of those who point out how incredibly different the movies are because they are absolute night and day, but equally good and, more importantly, equally enjoyable.     i guess the one and only edge that i'd have to give \\"volume 2\\" is that the character's you get to spend time watching in this half (alongside the Bride, who is just as awesome here as in \\"vol. 1\\") are just more in-tune with what i like to see. for example:    -i LOVE the character of Bill, and found the scenes between he and the Bride to be among my favorite ever \\"ex-lover\\" face-off's in all cinema. they're is certainly a nastiness to the scenes, but you can SEE the two of them still deeply caring for another, despite themselves, esp. upon the conclussion of their showdown. it is just excellent.    -Michael Madsen's Bud is quite possibly the most difficult character to not like in any movie ever. despite his actions toward the Bride (no more detail. don't want to ruin anything in case you haven't seen it.), you just can't help but kinda feel for the guy. i mean, a dude that has to take junk off his boss, clean up nasty toilet water at a [...]-hole strip bar, then go home to his El Paso trailer to sit alone and listen to Johnny Cash records just kinda screams \\"feel bad for me\\" even if we really don't wanna. Bud is awesome, and i like having more of him, so yet another nod to \\"vol. 2\\".       -Pei Mei is freakin' awesome, esp. if you love the old kung-fu movies that the \\"kill bill\\" series was so lovingly created to replicate. awesome!      -Elle Driver is my absolute favorite member of the divas,so her being more prominant in this half alone makes me love it, love it, love it! just EXACTLY what a \\"bad guy\\" bad girl should be, man. all this, and the revelations made during the throwdown between she and the Bride just makes that fight (and the conclussion of said fight) SO much cooler it's just insane!     there is one more character in this movie that i thought was a really neat addition, but to talk about this is to REALLY ruin the movie, so just in case, i'll let you guys decide who you think belongs in this fifth spot.     overall, \\"kill bill\\" start-to-finish is outstanding in everyway, but i wanted to yack about \\"volume 2\\" today, so that's that. thanks for reading and enjoy!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men is, in a way, a sci-fi movie. It takes place in the near future. The world is falling apart. War has become part of every day life. It is also a dystopian view of the one thing we take for granted; our future. But the thing Children Of Men does best is to take the convention of the sci-fi movie to humanize them in a way that is very original and affecting.  <br /> <br />Fifty years from now, the world as we know it is coming to an end. Women have been unable to have children. The world's youngest person is 18 years old. The world is self-destructing. Only England seems to be standing tall and strong (if you can call it that as the country is plagued with war and terrorism). <br /> <br />Theo is an ordinary man who used to be an activist at one point. Soon enough, he is thrown back into his old world in order to protect a young illegal imigrant who just happens to be pregnant. As different groups want to have the girl's baby, Theo has to protect the mother, protect the child and try to decide what to do next. If the baby falls into the wrong hands, then the world will be doomed forever. <br /> <br />Add to this many quirky characters (played by the likes of Michael Caine and Julianne Moore) and you end up with a very entertaining, very disorienting and very disappointing view of the future. Owen is incredible here as a man who is trapped between his past and his own devils. He cares for himself and himself alone. So when he has to try and take care of a girl he doesn't know, he quickly has to decided whether or not his life is more important than the baby's. <br /> <br />But the real reason to see this film is for its cinematography. Lushly photographed, this film is an example of cinematographic genius. It doesn't present the future as being the world of Star Wars or Star Trek. What we see is eerily similar to what we do see outside our window today. The future is grim and real.  There are also two amazing long shots in this film that will leave youbreathless and hungry for more.  <br /> <br />Children of Men is full of surprises. No one is safe in this film. And soon enough, the viewer starts feeling the very same way. A great sci-fi film that I'll want to watch time and time again.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|The Planet Earth series, which recently aired on the Doscovery Channel, is an outstanding look into the wild life and natural wonders of our beautiful planet. Each episode is centered around specific geographical features, ie: Fresh Water, Jungles, Mountains, etc. The high quality filming and editing (even without the HD or Blu-ray versions) is amazing. And more importantly than the quality is the learning experience. As I watched EVERY episode on television, I learned something new with every passing hour. I continuously found myself saying, \\"I didn't know that!\\" Bottom line is- this is a stellar look at wild life and our world that shouldn't be passed up.
B000NA2776|5.0|When I buy a cd, I always do it for a few songs. I always expect to hate a song or two and to feel indifferent about a few more on any given cd. But Mika's Life In Cartoon Motion is something so different that I find myself loving every single song on this cd! There isn't one song I skip, one song I feel indifferent about. I put the cd in and listen to it from beginning to end with a huge grin on my face. <br /> <br />Grace Kelly and Love Today are, of course, Mika's biggest hits. And you can easily understand why. They are fun, frivolous and they have that beat that makes you want to sing along out loud every time you hear the song (you can also add the song Lollipop to this lot). But there are many other gems on this cd as well. Two slower songs, Happy Endings and Any Other World are beautiful ballads that make use of a choir and hormonics to create melodies that are pure beauty. Big Girl and Billy Brown are fun and different, the kind of song that sticks with you long after you've listen to it. And Ring Ring is a strange mix of new and old, a combination that seems perfect for the artist. <br /> <br />In fact, that's exactly what Mika tries to do, mix the old with the new. He's not afraid of showcasing his idols (Beck, Bjork, Elton John, George Michael, Freddy Mercury) and inspiring himself all the while making these songs totally his. This is an original cd that will have you singing out loud. Pop music doesn't get much better than this.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|It may be named for an amateur wrestling move, but writer/director Ryan Fleck's \\"Half Nelson\\" drips with full-fledged cinematic sophistication from the first frame to the last. A story of two tormented lives inextricably intertwined by unlikely means, the tension it creates on screen is palpable and ever engrossing as it unfolds with increasing momentum.<br /><br />Best known for his role in the saccharine but well-received 2004 theatrical interpretation of Nicholas Sparks' novel \\"The Notebook,\\" Ryan Gosling lives his best day as an actor here. His portrayal of drug addict/history teacher Dan Dunn nabbed him his first Oscar nod, and his complete absorption of his character - everything from life-changing revelations to nervous ticks - justifies the accolades. With a fine script by Fleck and his collaborator Anna Boden in his hands, Gosling wrings it out for all its worth, seizing viewers in a way that only the best kind of actor can achieve.<br /><br />He quickly establishes Dunn as a good guy with a bad habit. An addict who spends many a night catching nary a wink of sleep, he still manages to be a consistent, scintillating presence for his junior high students in inner-city Brooklyn. Urging them to linger over history and consider it, not merely read and regurgitate, he provides an encouraging presence for the kids not just in the classroom but as a coach on the basketball court.<br /><br />He has a life full of important obligations, but his vices and dour circumstances - including an ex-girlfriend set to be married, played with understated verve by Tina Holmes, known for her work on \\"Six Feet Under\\" - keep steering him away from the right path. It nearly blows up in his face when tight-lipped student Drey, played endearingly by budding young actress Shareeka Epps, stumbles upon him stoned beyond mobility on the floor of the girls' bathroom. She is able to empathize with his unenviable situation, however, and grows particularly close to Dunn - especially considering their student/teacher relationship.<br /><br />With her mother, played brilliantly by frequent Fleck collaborator Karen Chilton, constantly at work to pay the bills, as well as an absent father, Drey is already grown up in many ways at her young age. Her brother is serving prison time for a botched drug deal, and Frank, played by Anthony Mackie, is to blame. Like a crafty car salesman, his charm is hard to resist yet hard, helping him succeeds in luring her back into his life despite the hardships he brought upon her family. His intentions seem innocent initially, as though he owes her a makeshift big brother after causing hers to vanish. Some things are too good to be true, however.<br /><br />The lives of Dunn and Drey soon overlap due to their intense, deep care for one another. Each has a host of problems, but both seem better equipped to fix each others' than their own. Frank drives a sharp wedge between the both of them, and sooner or later something has got to give.<br /><br />Everything falls into place in \\"Half Nelson\\" in a satisfying fashion. The script, the actors and the setting combine to make a whole different world for these characters to live and breathe in, even if it's one that looks familiar around the edges. A lot of films have promise, but this fulfills every one of them with magic to spare.onsidering their student/teacher relationship. <br /> <br />With her mother, played brilliantly by frequent Fleck collaborator Karen Chilton, constantly at work to pay the bills, as well as an absent father, Drey is already grown up in many ways at her young age.

B00005JM0B|3.0|As with the years that passed between the first and second films, the speculation as to wether or not a third film was going to happen at all was very high. We all heard the conflicting statements of both Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron. Finally Cameron said he would do it if 20th Century Fox would release it. Obviously that didn't happen and Arnold changed his mind after saying No.    The story of T3 is mediocre to average at best and I'll tell you why. To begin with, a lot of necessary exposition is missing. The writers essentially left out a major plot point with the former Cyberdyne Systems and Miles Dyson. Having a situation where Dyson designs Skynet's hardware and Brewster designs the software would have tied T3 a lot more strongly to the franchise. Another thing is what happens to Sarah Connor. This character has basically been the pennacle of the Terminator mythos. If the reigns have to pass from Sarah to John that's fine. But it would have worked better that we see her killed trying to escape after Skynet comes online.    Lastly the concept of The Terminatrix. Now just to be clear, I don't mind a woman being a Terminator. What I do have a problem with is the writers splitting hairs trying to differentiate the T-X from the T-1000. Now we could all see the difference between Arnold and the T-1000. But if the best they can do is showing the T-X endo during a copy, then that won't cut it. There are ways to come up with new concepts on something established. Maybe that's where Cameron could have worked some magic.    The only two things that worked for me were Arnold's description of what will happen in the future in terms of the war, and the ending surprised me though. It set up the fourth film pretty well. The missing elements Cameron's nightmarish vision and storytelling smoothness are what crippled this film. Not bad, but could have been better.
B000001DYD|5.0|This, along with one of the other reviewers that have written on here, is my first, and my favorite (along with 4 Track Demos). <br /> <br />On this album Harvey worked with the producer Steve Albini (who tends to have a very clubbish, echo-ish sound).  I read somewhere that they hooked the guitars up to amps, and then they shoved the mic down right infront of the amp to get a more live sound. <br /> <br />This album reminds me of a profile of a sex-crazed, crooked woman; however, despite these qualities, she's righteous.  She criticizes and patronizes men to be wee little beings, and feels big and above them, which allows there to be a sort of empowerment from the lyrics.  When I'm in some of my darkest moments, I always play this record, just to feel more empowered. <br /> <br />Her standout tracks are \\"Missed\\", which seems to be a story of a woman who lost her child (?), \\"Man-Sized Sextet\\" (which belongs to be on a soundtrack for a well done killer movie), \\"Hook\\", for it's amazing bluesy roots and great sound, \\"50 ft. Queenie\\" and \\"Yuri-G\\" because they're amazing rockers, the amazing, and empowering feminist \\"Man-Size\\" (guitar recording), and \\"Snake\\" for it's punk in-your-face style. <br /> <br />If you plan to buy this record, do yourself a favor, and save up a little more money to buy the 4 Track Demos album as well.  It's the perfect counterpart of Rid of Me - it's even MORE stripped down, and much more raw.
0385751060|5.0|There aren't many books that I will remember, but the story of Bruno is one of them. It is beautifully written, with hints of lovely humour. Bruno's calling his sister 'The Hopeless Case,' mimicing his parents, brought a smile to my face. It is a fable and written from Bruno's point of view. The view of a boy, whose life is changed when he moves from the luxury of Berlin to 'Outwith' during a time in our lives I think we all want to forget, but shouldn't. My twelve year old son read this, not really knowing anything about what happened in World War Two, and was amazed and saddened that although this was a story it was our history. A history that isn't being taught now, and he wanted to know how it could happen and what could we do to ensure it never happens again.   I'm so glad we read this book together We smiled and shed a tear and both will remember this haunting novel.
B0000501X5|5.0|PG&E, Pacific Gas And Electric company, unintentionally polluted ground water for the town of Hinkley, CA, but tried to cover it up rather than admitting they had caused a major health problem to the residents.  This cover up went on for a long time, until a barely-employable spitfire named Erin Brockovich, working for the lawyer Ed Masry, uncovers a strange file of real estate documents which include medical records.  Curious as to why a real estate file would contain medical documents, she begins to research the case.<br /><br />What follows is the true story of a woman named Erin Brockovich, who together with Ed Masry uncovered a major cover up of a health hazard resulting in one of the largest settlements in history.  This film is extremely well done, dividing its time between Erin the worker, Erin the single-mom trying her best to raise her three kids, and Erin the human being.  The movie skates over the fact that the real Erin got sick along with the rest of the town (although you can see some cut scenes of her illness in the \\"deleted scenes\\" feature).<br /><br />The movie is definitely a dramatized reproduction of the true story, though it still manages to hold very close to the truth.  A&E has done a special on the Erin Brockovich case which proves the movie stays true to form.  Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed Masry both give excellent performances.  The movie isn't necessarily fast-paced but the dialogue is intriguing, intense at times, and funny at times, keeping the entertainment level high.  The acting and dialogue alone are enough to carry this film.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the little guy taking on the giant, or a fan of Julia Roberts, either way you won't be disappointed.  Like Grisham's fictional 'The Rainmaker', you'll feel satisfied that sometimes the little guy can win ... in real life.  I recommend a 'buy'.  Enjoy!
B000N6TX22|3.0|I love the movie, and up until about half way through it, I was saying \\"Wow, I'm really glad we got this, it looks fantastic.\\"  <br />... <br />15 minutes later, I got the \\"408bc504\\" error (search for it) on my Toshiba HD-A2. We had to watch the rest of the movie in SD, which is ironic, because I'd guess that the reason there are errors with the media is because they attempted to press both formats on the same disc.  <br /> <br />Apparently Universal is replacing the discs for people with this error, which is nice, but it may be that you don't want to take the chance with this one quite yet? SO unfortunate, because it looked so nice when it was playing. :/ <br /> <br />Buyer beware? wait a few months, or just be prepared to watch the last 1/4 in SD... it's almost worth it.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|I went to the store and picked up a copy of this CD. I put it in my car and drove off. Song one starts out great, catchy and upbeat. Then I noticed on the phrase \\" I'm the mother fing princess\\" is edited. Before I purchased this CD I looked everywhere for a clean or edited label. I saw nothing. I can't believe 4 songs are edited. What gives? No option for the unedited CD? After noticing this after just the first 2 songs I turned it off. Very deceiving and disappointing. Of course I can't return it if they do release an unedited version. Why on earth would her label do this?  <br /> <br />As for Avril herself, I thought she was coming around to a more mature sound. Not here. Not that it's bad though. But the edit issue is just wrong!
B000O178BY|5.0|This is a very different Nine Inch Nails; musically far more experimental, and vocally more intense and passionate. Trent Reznor is an amazing vocalist, but I haven't seen any maturity rise in his lyrics. Yes, you'll hear some stuff here that's similar to what they've done before, but this time, it's more fun and addicting to listen to. I highly recommend this album. I think fans from the beginning will appreciate this. I think anyone will.
0618680004|5.0|Fantastic book.  Rather than review the contents as hundreds of others have, I'll explain why this book is important to me.  I live in the heart of our country, where being an atheist is suspect and despised.  The Christians here are so ethnocentric, they just assume that everyone is like them, everyone believes like them, and everyone feels the same way they do.  And I'm not just talking about the uneducated masses.  After I first realized that I was an atheist, and was ready to give up all the superstitions, I told two of my friends at a yearly retreat.  Both have their doctorates.  The next morning, for the first time, one of them initiated prayer over breakfast.  In a business setting, working with the public, advertising that I'm an atheist would be economic madness.  Every way that atheism is made to seem more reasonable and more acceptable is a step in the right direction, and makes it easier for me and those like me to `come out of the closet' with everyone, instead of just close friends and family. A friend of mine who is interested in politics is resigned to staying behind the scenes, because being an atheist is an unelectable characteristic.  It has just been a few years since Bush, Sr. said,  \\"I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.\\"   <br /> <br />Dawkins has done a public service writing this book.  It is thorough, well-done, thought- provoking, and interesting.
0790742780|4.0|William Foster is pretty much your average Joe with a nowhere job doing nothing much with life. \\"Falling Down\\" takes you into his world during the one day that he decides to fight back against life's trials. A traffic jam seems to be the trigger for what is a rollercoaster ride through the city, all the while Detective Prendergast is trying to track him down on his own last day before retirement.<br /><br />This is a seriously powerful look at life just wearing someone down, and their explosion against it. I saw it as a comment on the soul-destroying, monotonous lives that a lot of people have, and the yearning for a reality that could never be. Foster seemed to live in an idealised past that was no more.<br /><br />Michael Douglas is intense as William Foster, putting in a gritty and raw portrayal of a man fighting against the very world he lives in. While there are some humourous moments, mostly it is a shocking walk through the worst day of a man's life.<br /><br />Not a film to go \\"Wow! That was cool!\\" about, \\"Falling Down\\" is a fantastic movie with real depth. I would recommend it to anyone who just felt like choking the living **** out of some smarmy shop assistant. One might be surprised at how relatable Foster is.
B000NA28I4|4.0|Reading over a few of the reviews of this film I noticed one major difference between those who enjoyed the movie and those who, well, hated it.  Folks who read the book this film is based on generally seemed to regard this film as an atrocity.  Those people who didn't read the book (such as myself) either really enjoyed the movie or thought it was a mediocre film at best.  I happened to really enjoy the film.  It isn't the greatest fantasy flick to ever grace the silver screen but, then again, most fantasy flicks aren't out to be the greatest.  The bulk of them simply tell a generic story of a \\"chosen\\" one who sets out to fulfill their destiny or sacrifice their livelihood for the good of others.  To say that the film is cliche is cliche in and of itself.  Even those films and books considered to be some of the best fantasies involve a singular hero (Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, etc.) who, with a small band of friends, faces off against terrible odds and somehow manages to succeed.  Lesser fantasy films like \\"Krull,\\" \\"Willow,\\" \\"Dragonslayer,\\" and others all reflect the exact same story as do the great ones.<br /><br />\\"Eragon\\" falls into this \\"lesser\\" fantasy category.  It's a very fun, fast-paced film that tells the story of a young boy who becomes the \\"last dragonrider.\\"  He's expected to lead the war against the wicked King Galbatorix and his legion of evil.  Along the way he develops friendships with shady characters and honorable fellows.  It's a stock fantasy to say the least, but it's still fun to watch it unfold.<br /><br />I agree with others that say there are plenty of underdeveloped characters.  I also see where many would say that the film is too rushed.  However, with that said, I still found this film to be palatable.  The special effects are well done.  The dragon, Sephira (voiced by Rachel Weisz), is wonderful to look at.  The actors do a fine job with what they're given to work with although some, especially John Malkovich, lack sufficient screentime to really get a grasp on them.  The music fits the fantasy setting very well.  There's nothing that's overly terrible about the movie as a whole in my opinion.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy fantasy films along the same lines as \\"Krull\\" and \\"Willow,\\" \\"Eragon\\" should be right up your alley.  If you've read and enjoyed the book, I'm pretty sure you won't enjoy this movie based on the opinion of others reviewing this film.  I had no problem with it and also have no problem with adding this film to my personal collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fantasy film fans.

0452287588|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's latest book, A New Earth is thought provoking, encouraging, and incredibly inspirational.  Here is a man who definitely has his finger on the pulse of our emergence into a higher consciousness.  Throughout the book, I was completely enthralled by his deep insight, clear explainations, and timely wisdom.  The three points that stood out for me personally were the secrets to being at ease with life.  They include remaining in a state of non-resistance, non-judgment, and non-attachment.  True peace is found in the practice of complete surrender to whatever is going on around us.  Other profound insight that I took away from the reading of his book were the three states to real happiness: acceptance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm.  Tolle concludes his book with the most eloquent term for this new species, he calls us frequency holders.  May I be found faithful in doing my part in bringing about this much needed shift in human consciousness.
032147404X|1.0|While this book covered many interesting topics there wasn't much depth and I thought the author was glib and less than professional.  Of the many photography books I own this is one of the few I will probably pass on to others or trade in at a used book store.  Oh Well.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|This movie is JAM PACKED with adventure. The photography was advanced, the music was beautiful and rhythmic. There was violence, blood, adventure and the point of the movie was very intelligent! Trying to save our environment before something like tis happens. I think the movie needed a little moe profanity to add to the realism, but I loved it very much. I have no complaints with this movie. I could sit and watch it over and over again! (If I wasnt chasing my children... ).
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Of recent years Gomez, Muse, Mercury Rev, Elbow, Coldplay, Evermore, The Flaming Lips (from \\"Soft Bulletin\\" (1999) onwards) and Green Day's American Idiot and My Chemical Romance's \\"Black Parade\\" have really excited me the most. (Previous to these recent years Kings X and Dream Theater \\"did it for me\\" in the 90's together with Spock's Beard and the Flower Kings in the late 90's. Marillion were \\"my 80's\\" band together with Simple Minds, Big Country, Waterboys and U2. My 70's favorites were largely Genesis, Rush and Jethro Tull.     Joining the recent years of \\"music that really excites me\\" is this latest release from Neal Morse (ex Spock's Beard).     I have just finished my third complete listening (mainly in the car to and from work ovet the last 2 weeks) and this is an absolutely cracking classical / hard rock masterpiece.     Four tracks, 76 minutes. Track One (The Door) is 29 minutes and my favourite (for me it has all the combined elements of Dream Theater's \\"Scenes from a memory plus Spock's Beard \\"V\\" and it just rocks with power / emotion and melody in abundance). Mike Portnoy's (Dream Theater) drumming is the best I have ever heard it totally over the top, just breathtaking.    Second Track (The Conflict) clocks in at 25:00 minutes and is the heaviest Neal Morse has ever sounded, again with so much emotion nd melody and variety (check it out at the 3:54 mark, it goes into a folky rock piece, then seemlessy back into a rock out piece, stunning). Fantastic track.    Third Track (Heaven in my heart) is a nice ballady type track (at a mere 5:00 minutes. A bit of a break in proceedings before the big finish...    Track Four the 16 minute (The Conclusion), my second favourite track on the CD, totally stunning musicianship throughout. Again it all rocks, it's complex yet delivered with emotion and melody.    All 'n' all Neal is in top form with his keyboard, guitar work and vocals. He can sing, for he has a great voice, just so emotional.    Mike Portnoy delivers,for me his best ever performance on drums, hands down... sublime.    Randy George is superb and easily hear on this CD, he sounds great!    Paul Gilbert (guest guitarist) on guitar adds a \\"heavyness\\" not heard before on a Neal Morse album and it just rocks. (Think Spock's Beard \\"The Great Nothing\\" combined with Dream Theater's \\"Fatal Tradgedy\\" mixed together producing something new), that's where it sits with me... a classic.    As I write this review and think of my favorite \\"Classical Rock Masterpiece\\" tracks that instantly come to mind (in terms of variety / complexity / originality / highest caliber musicianship) are ...    - Caravan, \\"For Richard\\" (live Version from \\"New Symphonia\\" 1974) (original 1970).   - Emerson Lake and Palmer, \\"Tarkus\\" (title track from \\"Tarkus\\" 1971)   - Yes, \\"Close to the Edge\\" - (title track from \\"Close to the Edge\\" 1972).   - Jethro Tull, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" (Live version from \\"Bursting Out\\" 1978) (Original 1972).   - Genesis, \\"Suppers Ready\\" (Live version from \\"Seconds Out\\" 1977) (Original 1972).   - Gentle Giant \\"Octopus\\" (Live version from \\"Playing the fool\\" 1976) (Original 1972).   - Mike Oldfield, \\"Tubular Bells\\", (Live Version on \\"Exposed\\" 1979) (Original 1973).   - Pink Floyd, \\"Darkside of the moon\\" (1973)  - Elton John, \\"Funeral for a friend / Love lies bleeding\\" (from \\"Goodbye Yellow brick road\\" 1973)  - Lynyrd Skynrd, \\"Free Bird\\" (Live version from \\"One more from the Road\\" 1976).

If you enjoy any of the music listed above I hope you find time to give Sola Scriptura a listen and if you end up getting it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This film was a decent historical action piece in the theatrical release even though it didn't do well. I think this was probably because it was sort of sold in the trailers as a LOTR type film, which it certainly isn't. That said the extended director's cut is simply amazing. I don't understand why the movie was ever released in any other form. It makes my list of my favorite films of all time and is definately my favorite Ridley Scott flick, while originally it was my least favorite one.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something. <br />Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm?
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I work at a shelter. A resident brought this in to watch, after watching she relapsed. I kid you not. True story.

B000024D4R|4.0|Perhaps not as essential as Floyd's two biggest contributions to rock music (\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\"), but still very worth getting if for no other reason but to hear one of the most bitter and empassioned albums in rock history.  Roger Waters more or less rants about everything in this album, with a twisted sense of humor that makes you smile a little and nod despite the preachiness that he teeters on the edge of.  It was this period of Floyd's career that David Gilmour said that the emphasis was on the words, and not on the music; however, the music does not suffer too much.  I do think that this album could have done much better with a more \\"commercial\\" treatment, though it's understandable that that is what Roger Waters was fighting.  The three long songs in the middle of the album all have a basic format: a few verses and choruses, and then a long, drawn out, pretty unnecessary instrumental bridge that usually contains uninteresting meanderings by the band, and then finally another verse or two and another chorus or so.  I find myself constantly pressing the fast forward button because I really don't want to hear five minutes of dogs barking.  I must point out though that nothing is as spaced out on this album as \\"Echoes\\" was, with its long whale song section in the middle.  But I shouldn't complain too much--I mean, it's Pink Floyd, they liked long spacey bridges.<br /><br />So after all this complaining, why did I give the album 4 stars?  Well, for all those long bridges, there is just as much time when the band is playing some really interesting stuff.  The first few minutes of \\"Dogs\\" is fairly simple, but absolutely beautiful, in a melancholy way.  \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is about as groovy as Pink Floyd gets, and I'll admit that the long middle part isn't as boring as on the other two songs.  Listen to the bass part on Pigs (played by David Gilmour)--you can hear Gilmour's bend-crazy melodic lines in a perfect blend with Roger Waters' more rhythm based vocals and Nick Mason's rock solid drumming.  \\"Sheep\\" is the rocker of the album, with so much power and sheer frustration seeping through the vocals that you might very well want to stand and join with the sheep in their revolution against the dogs.  It is one of the highlights of Pink Floyd's canon.<br /><br />If anything, Roger Waters is a good story-teller, and the band's focus on creating moods and sound-scapes for the stories works very well.  It's not the most fast-paced album, nor the most catchy album, but it is easily one of the best rock albums made.  And did I mention the sound quality is amazing?<br /><br />Not the best album for those just getting into Pink Floyd, but a must-have for those who are ready to explore Pink Floyd's darker musings.' more rhythm based vocals and Nick Mason's rock solid drumming.  \\"Sheep\\" is the rocker of the album, with so much power and sheer frustration seeping through the vocals that you might very well want to stand and join with the sheep in their revolution against the dogs.

B000O178BY|5.0|When Trent came out with The Fragile I was very disappointed but this album makes up for it. I love the whole concept idea and the album flows very well. His exploration of sound effects puts him on a new level and I applaud him for it. The music out there now really sucks we need something refreshing. Thanks Trent.
B000002UAX|5.0|Of course, the album is great as you know.  Amazon has the cheapest price for this album (new).  Arrived very quickly with free super saver shipping.
B0002EXH54|5.0|I'm at work with nothing much to do so I'm writing reviews to kill time.  It's on my iPod at the moment, therefore, I'll write about these 8 tracks. <br /> <br />I love these tracks to Deth. Rust in Peace I would say is their pinnacle along with Countdown to Extinction.  I'm an easy listener, which means I listen to everything (Rock, Rap, Pop, ANYTHING).  I would recommend this music to people who like Megadeth obviously. If you're new to it, you may not like Mustaine's voice, right off the bat at least.  Give it time, i remember when I was even picky with music I still stuck with this album.  That says a lot right there. <br /> <br /> <br />
0800141601|5.0|I don't see why people are making so much noise against this movie. We all know this isn't a history class. We all know this isn't realistic in any way. It is NOT and it's NOT supposed to be!  I've never heard people say : \\"The musical version of The Three Musketeers with Gene Kelly isn't faithful to the book\\". Frankly, who cares? If you want the true story, the realistic story, get a book or a documentary. What we have here is a true \\"popcorn movie\\", the kind of film you put in your DVD player for a nice evening of \\"no thinking, just enjoying\\". This is a Hollywood family movie, with 3 great stars, fancy costumes, beautiful scenery and great music. To me, this is some of the best entertainment! The kind of entertainment that cinema was invented for and that was so succesful in the 40s and 50s.  It seems to me that people today just can't enjoy that kind of entertainment anymore. That's sad!  So, please, stop complaining and just enjoy for Pete's sake, lol!

1596912367|3.0|A secret service thriller with alternating sections. There is the story of Eva Delektorskaya, who had been recruited into the British Secret Service just before the outbreak of the Second World War.  She was very good  at her work;  but for much of the time the bigger picture is kept from her by her boss, and that picture includes the deadly rivalries within and between the various intelligence agencies.  When she realizes that as part of that game someone has tried to have her killed, she escapes from the outfit and adopts a new identity in England, of which the man who would become her husband and her daughter Ruth are kept in total ignorance.  But in 1976 she thinks she has reason to suspect that whoever wanted her dead in 1941 is still after her;  and she has to recruit Ruth to help her fend off the danger.  In order to do this, she has first to tell her story to Ruth, and she does this by sending her in instalments the story of her previous life.  I found it an unsatisfactory and unconvincing device: it reads like chapters in a novel that she had already written: it is a third-person narrative and there is far too much novelistic detail in the script for it to have been written for the purpose of putting Ruth into the picture.  On the other hand, if the account had already been written, why was it not handed over to Ruth all together, instead of being released to her in sections alternating with the first person narrative of Ruth's life after she is first told that her mother's life might be in danger?<br /><br />Ruth, divorced from a German husband, teaches foreign students in Oxford.  Prominent in her story are an Iranian student opposed to the Shah's regime, and her brother-in-law and his girl friend who suddenly turn up from Germany where they may have been involved with the Baader-Meinhof group.  At any rate, the police are interested in them.  One is led to suspect that there might be a connection between these strands and the situation in which her mother finds herself.  They play as big a part in Ruth's story as does her growing involvement in the task her mother has set her.<br /><br />I don't usually read spy-thrillers, and the intricacies of, say, John Le Carr&eacute;`s plots happen not to appeal to me very much.  The intricacies in this novel are of that kind;  and fans of Le Carr&eacute; will probably like this book, too.  It is of course very well written, as one would expect from the winner of many book prizes; but it is all plot, and the characters, except for Eva in her old age, are not really three- dimensional.  The climax, I think, is weaker than I expected it to be, though, in the few pages after that, the unravelling of motives in unexpected, and the suggested analysis of the political background in 1941 is one I have not come across before: I find it ingenious but historically not really convincing.<br /><br />The book did not really grip me;  but then I am not the best judge of this kind of novel.

0316010669|2.0|I am one of those that absolutely loved \\"The Tipping Point\\".

The cover \\"looks like Blink\\" but the text is a far different creature. Wish I would have spent the time rereading Blink....
B000002H70|3.0|I have to say it, after two months I still can't be convinced that this album is all the critics & fans claim it to be. Sure, it's thematically heavy, serious, existential, but for some reason it all seems a little contrived for me. I can allow myself to be moved by the opening track, despite its use of a cheap trick (it starts with some very low level chimes, forcing to turn up the volume, only to be hit by a thunderous opening to the album), and my mind does indeed turn to mortality as I listen to Smiths lyrics; and I can't deny the subtle work of lullaby, but in all it's a patchy album. The obvious highlight of the album is Same deep water as you, a mesmerizing echo back to the heydays of Faith. This song is a deep, slow, lush, dreamy sojourn into the parting of two lovers by the dark curtain that takes us all. Sounds depressing but it's quite a beautiful poetic piece. Could be a forgotten track off Faith. <br />It has some other decent songs like the airplay Pictures of you, but in all, it's just a darker version of their eclectic pop albums (which are actually more interesting) and doesn't come anywhere near their epic theme album Pornography or the delicately ethereal Faith. I'm afraid it's all hype. Of all the Cure albums I've so far listened to, this would have to be the biggest letdown. Maybe Smiths talents are indeed disintegrating. It does have one fine moment though; a poetic & obtuse lyric: \\"The shallow drowned lose less than we, you breathe\\". See? Smith still has it. It's just buried beneath his fame.  <br /> <br />
B000O178BY|4.0|While I miss the older, _HEAVIER_ NIN. This album really isn't too bad. Some music is very \\"watery\\" to me, like Linkin Park. That's how I'd describe \\"With Teeth\\" but this is a definate step up. The lyrics on \\"Year Zero\\" scream \\"anti-Fundamentalism, anti-Right Wing, anti-Moral Majority.\\" The vid for Survivalism has a military ''Task Force'' busting into the bedroom of a Homosexual couple and presumably killing them and dragging them away... pretty disturbing! Could that possibly be our America in the future? The song \\"Capital G\\" makes me wonder if Trent is talking about [G]od or [G]eorge W. Bush. Both are pretty big jerks. In a time when \\"EMO\\" dominates the airwaves, video channels, and Hot Topic (which USED TO BE a cool store) Trent dares to stand out from the sheep. Though \\"Year Zero\\" is good, it isn't GREAT. It doesn't hit nearly as hard as some of the OLDER albums, and \\"Heresy\\" will never be replaced AS my personal \\"F*** FUNDIES\\" anthem... \\"He made a virus, that would kill off all the swine!\\"  <br /> <br />(PS: I wish Trent and DIR EN GREY would team up, they could do some amazing stuff together)

A lucid, seemless album that stands above all that is contemporaries in 2007.   Listen to Trent's seven minute YouTube interview describing this album and it's origins and you may believe it's \\"not to sound preachy\\" but it's does via references to Iraq.   This is OK, Trent takes the soundscapes of Martin Gore and Robert Smith's wet dreams and lays them down over some awesome tracks.    \\"The Good Soldier\\" ,\\"The Begining of the End\\" and \\"God Given\\" are some effortless legendary NIN tunes.   Enjoy and turn it up LOUD!

0792833201|4.0|What makes this work of Mr. Spielberg's so great is not so much the ghosts and monsters, but the powerful theme that corruption and deception transcend life and death. We meet the Freelings. While Steve and Dianne have their faults (like smoking pot), they are reasonably good parents. Steve shows himself to be a good real estate agent. (He is effective without being obnoxious or pushy, and he is responsible for most of the sales in the area.) One great thing about this movie is that we have a fair amount of time to meet the family and get to know them before the horror begins. Soon afterwards, we start to see objects in the house moving. (Granted, it is strange that under the circumstances no one seems to have mentioned it before, but a movie only has so long to put together a plot.) While nothing really drastic has happened, we get the impression that these moving objects are just the start of something. Later, Caroline (the youngest of Steve and Dianne's 3 children) disappears. But they can still hear her voice. The skeptical (but desperate) Steve and Dianne go to supernatural experts for help. (Drastic situations will make non believers a bit more open minded!) Well, we see more and more ghosts. (Some of a monstrous nature.) And along with Steve, Dianne, Dana, and Robert, we may be asking: 'Why?' The psychic who comes in may be of some help, but her facts are far from straight. At one point she falsely claims that the house is 'clean.' Respecting those who have not seen the movie, I will not give away the ending. But I can safely say that Mr. Spielberg shows us that these horrors are the result of some real down to earth corruption and deception. (Poor Steve UNKNOWINGLY played a part in it.) It would seem that the genius Mr. Spielberg gives us monsters for show, but then reminds us that our own sins of dishonesty, ambition, and moral games are the true horrors in this world. Thank you Mr. Spielberg for raising this point so well. As the great Shakespeare said in his \\"Hamlet:\\" 'Foul deeds will rise, / though all the earth overwhelm them to men's eyes.' (\\"Hamlet\\" 1.2.281-282).his \\"Hamlet:\\" 'Foul deeds will rise, / though all the earth overwhelm them to men's eyes.' (\\"Hamlet\\" 1.2.281-282).
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I wasn't sure about getting a Bond movie but was impressed on this one.  <br />The plot kept thickening and twists kept your interest through the movie. <br /> <br />I think it is the best Bond movie and could interest non-Bond people that think they are just skin flicks as this one is not. Its a good \\"Spy\\" movie.
B000003ER4|5.0|I agree wholeheartedly with MartinP's excellent review, with some reservations.  Rene Kollo's contribution is seen as defective, as other reviewers have also pointed out.  The tenor indeed has a thin voice, shrill and metallic, and wobbly in places.  But he is perfectly suited for the role of Paul, a fragile, delusional soul.  He is no Walter von Stolzing (which he recorded, regretfully), but here he is well cast, and immensely believable. Luxon (Frank) and Wagemann (Brigitta), and especially Prey (Fritz/Pierrot), are superb, and Neblett is a perfect Marietta/Marie, one of the few roles she has recorded in a complete opera.  (Some may recall her Minnie in La Fanciulla del West.)  Leinsdorf provides a warm, sensuous, environment.  Korngold's music is perhaps too facile, not complicated enough for a 20th Century composer, but you are in for a mesmerizing experience, a few hours to lose yourself in a world of eerie fantasy.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Great collection of Blondie songs.<br /><br />She's got amazing versatility in her voice.<br /><br />Her charged spirit is so infectious...she just has no limit to her abilities to vocalize you straight onto the dance floor.<br /><br />A Great party CD.
B000O178BY|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in a long time. The musicianship on this disk is fantastic. The production is fantastic. I've spent hours listening to it with headphones, trying to figure out what he's doing and there are so many subtle layers that I just come away with more questions. Not only does it sound great, but the songs are great as well. <br /> <br />This is my favorite NIN album since The Downward Spiral. I've liked them all, but this one is special.
B000O178BY|4.0|Trent reznor is on the ball these last couple of years, releasing with teeth and now Year Zero, both solid works. It continues much of the same progression and style of music he has had recently, with some good change ups from a harder sound/rock driven music to a more toned down, lyrically driven music as well.  I am starting to warm up to his newer material, but Still find myself going back to the classics, Pretty hate machine, Broken, and the downward spiral.  Worth picking up, some solid material that really is a blend of all of his years work.
B00005JOLI|4.0|To tell you the truth i had never read the book before because the libary always has other holds on it but i went ahead and wacthed this movie with my sister and younger brother we were hoping we would enjoy it despit bad reveiws, so it turns out we liked it, my sister said it's seem's more of a remake of lord of the rings (as everyone else does ) the dragon was wonerfully done we liked the fact that it had a mind of it's own. Ed Spellers did better than i thought for a newcomer, i always enjoy Jeremy irons (exepct for the really bad D&D)the only miscast really was John Malvoich as the evil king i just think he didn't fit well, overall a pretty good fantasy not a classic but good enough for me.( it's my 3rd favariet dragon movie besides dragonheart and dragonslayer i highly recommend those)
B000003S0P|5.0|Original, Inspiring, Epic! A true masterpiece...................... <br /> <br />\\"Starless\\" Still sends shivers down the spine after all these years.
006112429X|3.0|Liked: <br />The idea and its general delivery, although confused over the nature vs nurture argument of most reviewers. My take on the book is that she clearly believes that the father was to blame for not appreciating what was happening and providing her any support (or at least the benefit of the doubt), whether or not she is prepared to admit this to herself/the reader of her letters. <br /> <br />Disliked: <br />Introduction of Kevin's each move through a series of hints - undermined the tension, although perhaps done intentionally to lessen the impact of the barbaric nature of each act. <br />Over-use of Shakespeare quotes. <br />Belaboring obvious sentiment. <br />The ending : cop-out that the husband is, in fact, dead, and the volte-face of Kevin's remorse is clumsy. Why give it a happy(ish) ending? Serving 5 of his 7 years, getting out, and doing it again would be far more credible.(Also, wasn't April 8th 2001 on a Sunday, not a Monday? and she misspells Veniero's. Shame on her!) <br /> <br />Generally dislike: <br />Reviewers who criticize books because they are 'filled with bad writing'. Maybe you should have paid closer attention; you might have learned something. <br />
B000002KKK|4.0|This is ZZ at their best. Forget Eliminator. This pounds it into oblivion.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe The Top aren't as good at blues as, say, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf or B.B. King. But it's still pure BLUES, y'know? Take A Fool for Your Stockings. Could've easily been an old blues standard. Great, great song too. Very good use of the hammer-on during the guitar solo, and those vocals are solid blues. I'd go out on a limb and say it's the best slow song The Top ever recorded. Meanwhile, the hits I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide and Cheap Sunglasses are essential Top: raw, raunchy, rockin' and bluesy. Them at their best.<br /><br />You also get a couple of fine covers for your money: I Thank You and Dust My Broom. Neither compare to the originals, but that's simply because the originals are COMPLETELY amazing, as opposed to simply amazing, as these two are. You also get some funny stuff, like the dirty Manic Mechanic (even if you don't think the immature lyrics are funny, gotta love that basso-profundo voice!) and She Loves My Automobile.<br /><br />Four stars because a couple of these songs are just average - Lowdown in the Streets has cool backup vocals and nothing else; Esther be the One and Hi-Fi Mama could've stayed or gone, and I wouldn't have been too sad either way. But there is not a SINGLE bad song, making this the best disc they ever did. They're not my favorite band, but I can see why people like them.<br /><br />Also check out Tres Hombres and Rio Grande Mud!
0743298020|5.0|No spoilers    Wow. What a story this is. First of all, I'll right off the bat admit that I do not have much experience in reading books like this. My favorite book genres have always been psychological thrillers and historical fiction, and that is, for the most part, what I read. Because my last eight or so books have been the installments in a psychological thriller series, I decided I wanted a break from that and sought out a book that relied more on the substance of the story and the characters instead of on surprises and edge of the seat plots. I found The Thirteenth Tale, and I couldn't have been happier.    Although I was nervous to pick up this book, not wanting a sappy, boring, querulous novel, after the first several pages, I was drawn into the story and the lives of these characters and I could not stop thinking about them and reading on. Although this is a debut, I can honestly say that this is superb character development, and if you don't feel for at least one of these characters, slide your hand over your wrist and check you pulse. From the very beginning I felt invested in these characters and and what happened to them, and it has been quite a while since I've felt as connected to characters as I did with those in The Thirteenth Tale.    Take it from me, a 19 year-old male who favors psychological thrillers and historical fiction, this is a GREAT novel whose style is executed perfectly (a story being told within a story, being told within another story, yet perfectly coherent) and whose characters a very real. I highly recommend this book, and am (already) unpatiently awaiting Setterfield's sophomore effort.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|It's been more than a decade--maybe more--since we've been treated to a real Bond story, matched with excellent directing and an intriguing portrayal of the world's #1 secret agent. Instead of cartoon villains and implausible action, we see in the first few moments that this Bond is different, this Bond is actually interesting. Based relatively loosely on an updated version of Ian Fleming's novel of the same name, we see how Bond becomes Bond, and we enjoy learning many of the secrets behind the enigmatic man. <br />One thing I have to add: Who resurrected the James Bond stunt team? For years, blue screen and CGI effects have completely washed away anything interesting about the James Bond fight-or-flight scenes. The initial chase scene through the construction site alone is worth the price of admission. Who do we have to bribe to see a repeat performance in the next 007 film?
0763627410|5.0|My 14-month-old has prefered this book over any other since he got it at 5 months.  We're on our second copy now since he turns the pages a little more enthusiastically than the paper can withstand.  He loves the pictures and the rhymes and he always kisses the Mom Fish at the end!
B000JLTRKE|3.0|I rented World Trade Center, and let me say this is a decent film.  But, it is not even close to the greatness of another film that year: United 93.<br /><br />I usually enjoy Oliver Stone movies, and I enjoyed World Trade Center, but it's superficial and boring.<br /><br />If you like Oliver Stone as much as I do, you will appreciate his other wilder films like Natural Born Killers, J.F.K., Any Given Sunday, The Doors, and Nixon.<br /><br />I should mention the upset about Oliver Stone doing a film based on the World Trade Center Firemen and Policemen: I can tell you there's not a shred of credibility to sustain any accusation like this against Director Oliver Stone.  The film is an accurate and faithful depiction of three men trapped in the rubble after the towers imploded.  Stone gives a very HONORABLE depiction.<br /><br />The problem here is how boring the film is.  There's very little life in this piece of cinema.  And, yet it is what people would have hoped in Stone's restraint to a non-political account, which is probably why the film is so damn boring.  But, I guess respect is what people want, and for Stone to talk about something other than social-political commentary of which this has none.<br /><br />Do me a favor: go out and rent United 93 instead, because not only does it have no politics, but it is the most suspenseful film production of 2006, and maybe even since the millenium began.
B000O178BY|5.0|I have loved Nine Inch Nails for years so take with that what you want as I suppose this review will be somewhat biased. However, of all of the cds and dvds that have been released from Nine Inch Nails, I feel like this is the only one without any low points at all. I have listened to it non-stop on a constant loop since I bought it and each go around it is still great. This cd does have some personal high points which to me are \\"The Good Soldier\\", \\"Capital G\\", and \\"The Great Destroyer.\\" I wouldn't be able to review this cd without also saying it is awesome what Trent is doing to promote this. I get countless cds per year and pop them in the player without giving a second glance at the case, but with this one I searched in and out of it to find clues to new websites or shards of imformation. <br /> <br />To me, this cd sounds a lot like \\"With Teeth,\\" the way it is mechanical and feels electric. However, the words are as biting as and thought out as Broken which to me of all of the NiN cds has some of the most cruel and bone-hitting lyrics. To read the lyrics it is exactly like reading a very concise book. With few words, this book delivers images of things that are going downhill. If the cd were $100, I'd still probably buy it and consider it the best purchase of my life. <br /> <br />I can't say enough good things about this.
078322933X|3.0|Neither Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, \\"CSI\\" star William Petersen nor \\"Fraser\\" girlfriend Amy Brenneman had hit their stride in TV and movies when this 1996 production was released, leaving only Hollywood bad girl Alyssa Milano as a name star in this teen version of \\"Fatal Attraction\\" that also mixes some affect from both the original and remake of \\"Cape Fear\\".<br /><br />Wahlberg, who until this time had been known as rapper Mark E. Mark and a pinup underwear model, plays a psycho that matches physical skill with mental aptitude to alternately charm and terrorize high schooler Witherspoon, dad Peterson, and stepmom Brenneman. His role is metaphoric to the role Glenn Close played in \\"Fatal Attraction\\" while dad Peterson figures out right away he's a bad guy and warns daughter and wife of his bad deeds to come.<br /><br />The film travels a predictable path to an apocalyptic closing scene where Wahlberg and his gang of four seek revenge on Peterson, who trashed their home. They come equipped with guns, other weapons and psychic terror to carry out their revenge...only to learn the family lives in an impregnable home. As you may guess, it turns out not to be impregnable after all. The movie closes with many scenes of ultraviolence where the ending is just as predicatable as the rest of the story.<br /><br />What characterizes this film is its incredible violence. In one scene, a child of about 10 or 12 runs over a bad guy with a car. In another scene, stepmom Brenneman drills a hole through a bad guy's hand with a handheld motorized drill. Another time teen Witherspoon stabs her former boyfriend with a jagged edged piece of wood, leaving a gaping hole in his back. If this isn't enough, there is an animal beheading in the flick.<br /><br />This is an exciting and involving film but its copycat story and level of violence work against its value as art. While there is a lot of shock value to keep you riveted to the screen, it become increasingly more over the top as it goes on. In that respect it reminded me of the 1979 opus \\"Fury\\", where scenes of incredible violence punctuated the final 30 minutes and essentially changed the value of the film.<br /><br />\\"Fear\\", too, is a throwback to 1970s slasher and hate filled movies and operates in the same horizontal plane. It pretends to be a teen version of \\"Fatal Attraction\\" with some of the tension of \\"Cape Fear\\" but is actually more akin to \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" with violent criminals taking the place of \\"The Hills'\\" flesh eating wackos. Meanwhile, Mark Wahlberg's psycho has none of the artistry that Robert Mitchum and Robert DeNiro displayed in the original and remade \\"Cape Fear\\".<br /><br />I think it a good idea to show some fear before buying this and bringing it home if you have children under age 17. If you are a teen and/or want a cheap thrill, excitement and violence, this is your cup of tea.eminded me of the 1979 opus \\"Fury\\", where scenes of incredible violence punctuated the final 30 minutes and essentially changed the value of the film.    \\"Fear\\", too, is a throwback to 1970s slasher and hate filled movies and operates in the same horizontal plane.

B000051NT1|5.0|Well, if you CAN'T find the 6-CD complete Matrix set described elsewhere, this is a fine taste indeed.  Great sound quality and great ambiance, and a focused, confident Doors with effortlessly \\"on\\" vocals from Jim.  Nice \\"Summertime\\" interlude in the middle of a \\"Light My Fire\\" jam.  Classic stand, only a scoop's worth, but the coins are still gold.
1582701709|3.0|On Tuesday evening one could have spotted me in the corner of my local Borders reading \\"The Secret.\\" (And yeah, I did so secretively as I'm not one to readily promote self-help books and proclaim to fellow shoppers, \\"I need help and maybe this book will be my salvation!\\") Anyway, The Secret can be summed up in four words and one generic phrase: \\"thinking makes it so.\\" I read this book with as much of an open mind as I could muster, and I'm glad I did. Still, I'll start with the things I disliked about the book: <br /> <br />--Any academic (or any person with an ounce of healthy skepticism) would be flipping the pages for references upon phrases along the lines of, \\"science proves positive thoughts are 60 times stronger than negative thoughts\\" or, \\"numerous studies show positive thoughts take effect faster than negative thoughts.\\" Uhhhmmm... may I see these studies? Yeah, thought not.    <br />--I couldn't help it. I snickered when they asked me to do the following: believe all my bills were checks and add a zero to the amount. Then, total my bills and say thank you several times for the money I've \\"received.\\" (Nope, I couldn't make this stuff up.) So really, when the author claims I'll \\"receive\\" copious amounts of wealth just by willing it, I may as well mail myself Monopoly money and jump for joy at my \\"wealth.\\" It's one thing to have gratitude for what you already possess and quite another to have gratitude for the imaginary. I'm all for being grateful for my super-cool family and awesome job... but I'm not going to thank my lucky stars for my hot Jaguar which, oh wait, doesn't exist (\\"yet,\\" as the book would reassure me). <br />--In the weightlo- I mean, 'health' section, I don't feel that I could ever eat a pound of chocolate in one sitting and pretend it won't be detrimental to my rumpus. I think the science of nutrition is going to outweigh the Law of Attraction on this one. <br />--Which brings me to the way she adds disclaimers throughout her book. She actually does write that the people who can eat what they want and not gain a pound can do so through the law of attraction. In the small print she advocates basic nutrition advice like chewing your food slowly and eating in the present. Similarly, she wants the reader to make believe they're wealthy now so it's practically irrelevant what your bank account says since \\"je pense danc je suis.\\" <br /> <br />The good? <br />--I truly believe if everyone adapted the positive thinking advocated in this book, the world would be a much better, happier place. <br />--Ok, I confess-- I've been trying for the past week to summon the \\"Law of Attraction\\" and it does work in strange ways. I've gotten better parking spots, found things in my purse I didn't know I had, I've gotten in touch with my creative side, and I love my body more than I did before. By applying a few concepts from this book I've been able to value what I do have and not sweat the small stuff. While I won't attribute this to \\"my inner magnetism drawing good things,\\" it's very true that life is overall much easier with a good attitude. I look at the \\"science\\" behind the Law of Attraction akin to my view of horoscope: it's fun to believe, but I definitely question the hard science. Then again, what spiritual belief isn't wrought with scientific holes? <br />--I fully support the way she wants women (or men) to have a positive attitude towards their own bodies, even if they want to change its shape. I wish more women looked at themselves in the mirror and think how gorgeous they look instead of focusing on their stomach.  <br />--I agree that contractions (don't, can't, won't, etc) make a person focus more on the very thing one tries to negate instead of the more positive alternative. For example, \\"I won't smoke today\\" will elicit the desire to smoke more than \\"I like running\\" (should that be the desired alternative to smoking).  <br />--\\"The Secret\\" brings a lot of generic aphorisms like \\"thinking makes it so\\" and \\"worry is a misuse of the imagination\\" into something a little more cohesive and tangible.  <br /> <br />This book promises the reader anything their heart desires with a simple change of attitude. That's quite a tall order. With everything to gain and nothing to lose, I don't think it hurts to adopt a new perspective and seeing what happens. I know I've been pleasantly surprised.
B0000A118M|5.0|This is a deeply spiritual album.  It never ceases to move me in some way everytime I hear it.  It feels so real and authentic that if you're not careful, you may shed a tear of joy or two.  It's just one long suite, made by Coltrane after he kicked his heroin habit and found his soul and God again.  It's not often one describes a jazz album as moving (Miles's Sketches of Spain is the only one who comes to mind), but there's really no other way to describe this wonderful, transcendent, beguiling album.<br /><br />Many have said this jazz album has changed their lives.  Sometimes I think that's hyperbole when someone says \\"it changed my life\\" (not just this album, all artistic works).  But then, art definitely enhances lives, makes them more meaningful, and maybe ultimately change them in some meaningful way, and this is a work of art, no doubt.  I think the change is gradual, but stuff like this can jumpstart many people.  It's really inspirational, even today, which makes it even greater than the day it was made.  It still speaks to many people.  The tones and emotions that Coltrane brings here are universal, and still speak to us all....
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I bought this DVD and immediately got on-line to find The Celtic Women touring information.  We were so fortunate to find them within 70 miles of our home in Peoria, Illinois, and only had to wait for 2 weeks to hear them in person! We got back from the concert last night, and all that I can say, is UNBELIEVABLE!  Each and every one of these beautiful women had voices like angels, and the fiddle player was amazing.  Every musician was so talented that as a whole, they came together to bring on one truly awesome show.  I can't remember ever being so entertained.  Buy this DVD and you will be hooked!
B00007LTIL|5.0|Many love to talk about the Grateful Dead and their marathon concerts.  Having seen them 12 times (including the last 2 shows Jerry Garcia did), I can attest to their great live prowess.  But they were just as good in the studio, and this album proves that beyond any doubt.  This is my favorite Dead album, a country pop masterpiece.  The songs here have surprising depth and substance.  Robert Hunter's lyrics are the best he ever wrote, and the tunes are absolutely beautiful.  This album sounds more countryish than anything (especially on the ballads), perhaps because the Dead were listening heavily to Merle Haggard and country radio at this time.  This has that \\"Bakersfield\\" sound (as an amazon friend told me), and that's why it resonates so deeply with me, because I love that sound.  This album has more depth than current country music.  It's a lovely album, arguably the Grateful Dead's best....
0316066524|5.0|Let's get a few things out of the way about Infinite Jest.  Is it an easy read?  No, it's not, but it's far from impenetrable and once you get into it, I.J.'s a hard book to put down.  Does the plot resolve itself in a satisfying narrative conclusion?  No, it doesn't, but if you read books simply for plot don't even bother trying to read Infinite Jest. Is it bloated and pretentious?  Perhaps (particularly the 100 pages of footnotes), but that's what makes it so fun.  So what's so good about it?  Let me put it to you this way - once I finished reading it two days ago, I honestly feel like I have just come off an intellectual acid trip that has made me look at the world,  addiction, our collective need to find contentment, what a novel can do, and tennis in a whole new, enlightened way.  As well, the novel's a roller coaster emotionally as it is alternately hilarious and harrowing, is astounding in it's endlessly creative narrative structure and multiple narrators, and to top it off D.F.W.'s prose and dialogue are a true pleasure to read, .  Infinite Jest is a commitment for the four to six weeks required to read it, but for anyone who enjoys a serious literary marathon it's well worth the challenge.

0465092756|4.0|Mr. Woit's central argument is that String Theory is not yet \\"the\\" truth, might not become fully so and therefore should not be treated as the \\"only game in town\\". <br /> <br />Anyone that makes a frank, open, honest attempt at seeking the truth and challenging prevailing assumptions deserves credit and recognition.  Mr. Woit's might not have gotten all the actual physics right (I cannot tell) but he has a case and presents it with competence, passion and respect. <br /> <br />Very readable, despite some repetiveness and technical language.
B00004VVS9|5.0|5 Stars for Phantasm !!! I saw this movie when I was a kid and I have to say The Tall Man, sacred the Hell out of me. It was the first movie to really give me nightmares. Then came Jason & Michael. I have'nt seen anything since the beginning of these 3 legasies to even come close. I highly recommend them.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|I consider myself fairly open when it comes to unique, or even delayed plot structure, except here. I must admit, the best parts of this movie were in the trailer. This movie made no sense, and the only possible reference to Babel was that you could understand no one. I fast forwarded through 1/2 of the 2.5 hour movie, and didn't miss a thing. If you must watch it, rent it and don't think it's worth keeping for an extra day based on the trailer, it won't be.
038533348X|5.0|\\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma! [lies]\\"    In \\"The Cat's Cradle,\\" Vonnegut provides an ironic and satiric look at religion, science, and ethics.  The storyline consists of John and his attempts at researching Felix Hoenikker, one of the fathers of the atomic bomb, as he attempts to write a book about Hiroshima.  Although Vonnegut's novel is intended as humorous, a powerful message lies beneath the surface.  Vonnegut explores the purpose and role of religion, and delves into the philosophical debate on science and ethics.    Bokononism, the religion of a tiny banana republic, San Lorenzo, is the central focus in Vonnegut's expose on religion.  Bokonon, its founder, was shipwrecked onto this tiny island and, with the help of McCabe, attempts to transform the backward and exploited island into a utopia.  When this proves impossible, Bokonon invents his religion.  Although admitting that Bokononism is \\"nothing but lies,\\" it provides a distraction to the San Lorenzoans and inspires meaning and fulfillment in their lives of misery.  Although the Books of Bokonon are predicated on blatant falsehoods, its devotion and practice provide the reason for existence for the impoverished San Lorenzoans,  even with the specter of capital punishment to those who practice it.  Even their dictator is an adamant follower.  The essence of Vonnegut's philosophy is best illustrated in the Bokononist tale of creation, in which a playful God tells man that his purpose in life is to figure out what that purpose is, for the implicit message is that there is no grand purpose or plan for life.    The symbolism of the \\"Cat's Cradle\\" further illustrates this point.  A game played with string by children, this was the game played by Felix Hoenikker on the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  This had such an impact on Newt, his youngest son, that he later creates an abstract painting of the cat's cradle, then laments how maddening this game is, for it nothing but a \\"bunch of X's\\":  \\"No d--n cat, no d--n cradle.\\"   This illusory game symbolizes that life has no true purpose, much like the X-shaped strings that form nothing tangible.    In John's pursuit of Felix, he discovers that, although he may have had a brilliant scientific mind, he failed to take responsibility or to see any danger in his work.  Although Felix had no malicious or odious intents when he worked on the bomb, he also exhibited no remorse at its implications.  He was far from innocent.  His lack of ill intent was not enough, as it was his responsibility to restrain what he unleashed on the world.  He viewed his work as pure research and nothing more.  Indeed, his very last invention, Ice-9, which has the frightening implications of destroying all earthly life, was worked on as a hobby.  He took no moral view of the implications of his work and selfishly failed to see beyond his own self-fulfillment.  Through Felix, Vonnegut sends a powerful message that it is the moral obligations of scientists and engineers to be accountable for the potentially destructive nature of their work.    Penned in the early 1960s, \\"The Cat's Cradle\\" does contain some campy sci-fi elements.  The scientific explanation of Ice-9 seems quite a stretch, even for a 1960s sci-fi novel parody. Furthermore, most of the characters are one-dimensional caricatures of an abstract group.  There is no real character development.  However, this was not Vonnegut's main purpose, which was to illustrate the inherent evil of irresponsible scientists and the fallacy of religion.  In these respects, Vonnegut delivers.    Overall, this is an easy read, but is entertaining and thought-provoking.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|This guy is a gifted actor and a hit-making vocalist for a hard rock/metal band. Not too many artists can pull off what he does.  <br />I picked up their debut when it came out, and I was blown away with the futuristic sound, the imaginative song-writing, and the top-notch, soaring vocals.  <br />These guys really pack an emotional wallop. I'm not going to say they are really heavy, but this stuff sounds really good on my stereo. For this, their sophomore album, they strip down their futuristic sound and focus on driving riffs and tight songwriting, tossing away some of the quirkiness of the debut. This is in no way a bad thing, because it is a very solid album. No filler on here. They should be around for years to come, because they actually scored some hits off this album like \\"From Yesterday\\" and \\"Attack\\". <br />4 1/2 stars. <br />
0743496728|5.0|This is by far one of the best and most important books I have read.  I went through so many emotions while reading it from wanting to keep my boys safe from being bullied to keeping them from being the one to bully others.  I think this is a book that all mothers should read and reflect on.  Every parent wants the same thing for their children that being safety and happiness.  Too often other kids have the power to steal this away from them while parents are unaware that this is even happening.  I know for myself, after reading this book, I am going to pay more attention to what is going on in school , on the bus and around the neighborhood.  When I finished this book , I went up to my sleeping boys room and prayed for their safety and the children they were to come in contact with in the future.  Great job Jodi!!  I have always been a fan and cannot wait until your next book!
B000MXPE7O|5.0|_The Good Shepherd_ is a paranoid's delight, detailing the rise of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as it initially developed following World War II.  Directed by Robert DeNiro (who also has a role in the film as a general who played a key part in creating the CIA), this film shows us a rare glimpse into the world of spies and counter-spies, paranoia, and secrecy that surrounds the cult of intelligence.  Much of the film is indeed an accurate portrayal of the history of said agency and its role in America's foreign policy decision making throughout much of the Twentieth Century.  The film follows the career of Edward Wilson (played by Matt Damon) from his early years as a poetry student at Yale University, periodically spying on his professors who allegedly were linked to Nazi-sympathetic organizations, to his role in the development of the Allied intelligence community during World War II, to the creation of the CIA and the birth of the Cold War and beyond.  The film is one of epic proportions (some have compared it to other classics such as _The Godfather_) and is essential viewing for all thinking people.  In the world of undercover operations, no one is to be trusted.  Whether or not a certain individual is in fact working for Allied intelligence, the Nazis, or later the Soviets simply cannot be determined, and we witness this world develop as the sense of trust breaks down and paranoia ensues.  The movie travels back and forth between the events that gave rise to the Bay of Pigs fiasco (also hinting at the later Kennedy assassination - believed by some conspiracy theorists to have been the work of the CIA) and the earlier career of Wilson.  At Yale University, Wilson joins up with the class of upper crust WASPs (the \\"Old Americans\\") and takes part in their adolescent rituals as part of the ultra-secretive Skull and Bones fraternity.  (Many of our political leaders have arisen from this fraternity and some have conjectured that they are responsible for wielding the true power in the world.  The movie even hints at the idea that they may have been responsible for \\"Soviet power\\" as well, as the true puppet masters behind world events.)  Wilson falls in love with a deaf girl (he has a certain \\"weakness\\" for deaf girls as we are to see later in the movie); however, a brief affair of his with an upper class girl leads to an unplanned pregnancy and thus forces him to marry.  (However, it should be pointed out that one gets the impression that the \\"elites\\" are manipulating the whole thing from behind the scenes anyway, because throughout the movie never once is definitive proof provided that the child is even his.  Furthermore, he is to go away for a long time to aid the Allied war effort and thus is not even there to see his newborn son.)  From his early days of spying on university professors (or are they really?), Wilson becomes more and more involved in the intelligence community.  This leads him to serve on the side of the Allies during World War II.  Following World War II, the Allied leaders make a trade of Nazi scientists for Jewish scientists, and thus begins the Cold War as the Soviet power and America and Britain contend for control of the world.  Eventually a series of events will force Wilson to make the ultimate sacrifice - one of many in his desire to further the aims of American imperialism and consolidate the power of the CIA.  The movie also shows and hints at such historical realities as the presence of homosexuals in the intelligence community (and the fact of their homosexuality being used to blackmail them - the rites of the Skull and Bones fraternity could also be described as vaguely homoerotic for that matter!) and the CIA's experiments with drugs (in particular LSD).  There are some rather chilling lines and uncanny prophecies in this movie which haunted me for days following my viewing of it.  At one point Robert DeNiro's character remarks that it was the \\"clerks and civil servants\\" who gave Hitlerhis power, and thus it will be necessary to somehow limit the CIA's power because otherwise it runs the risk of creating a totalitarian surveillance state.  Secondly, at one point in the movie Matt Damon's character (Wilson) is asked by Joe Pesci (playing an Italian mobster) what \\"his people\\" (presumably the upper crust WASPs) have, mentioning that the Italians have the church, Jews have their tradition, and blacks have their music.  To this, Damon replies that they have the United States of America and that the rest are just visitors here.  At another point, it is said that the people from the CIA never put a \\"the\\" in front of CIA.  When asked why, they reply that putting a \\"the\\" in front of CIA would be like putting a \\"the\\" in front of God.  (Angelina Jolie's character remarks on several occassions that during the dinners of the Skull and Bones fraternity they first account for all members of the Bonesmen and then invoke God.  As she puts it, \\"Agency first, God second.\\")  These are some of the chilling lines from the movie.  Ultimately the movie raises some very disturbing questions about the nature of government.  As America heads further and further towards a surveillance state (brought further in that direction with each impending war), it becomes necessary to examine where we have come from.  As is asked in the movie, do the elite controllers who make and break world events try to keep war to a minimum, or do they merely use war to further their own agendas and consolidate their power?  Certainly a scary question to ponder.  I feel that this movie offers much to think about (and ultimately is very frightening!), but so long as the tough questions remain unasked and people remain asleep at the wheel, it will be that much easier for those in power to slide us off into totalitarianism.  Finally, I should say that I find it odd that this movie (which not only offers much food for thought but is genuinely very well put together) has gathered such low reviews.  Perhaps it is just a further indication of the fact that the public does not like to think and ask questions and this is scary in and of itself.  <br />
B000N3T0DW|4.0|<br />Pedro Almodovar is Spain's greatest contemporary filmmaker.  His movies are marked by strong women characters and a rich visual style.  VOLVER (To return) has the dead comically coming back to life in a film set in La Mancha, which has a high suicide rate because of vast empty plains and strong winds.  I don't really understand the plot of VOLVER, which got Penelope Cruz a Best Actress Oscar nomination a few months ago.  We have an aunt who dies, is buried, then comes back to life.  She was never really dead, it was someone else.  And we have a teenage girl raped by a man who may or may not be her father; she murders the man after one attack too many.  Cruz plays the life-affirming Raimunda, who takes care of the body--by dragging it to a nearby empty restaurant meat freezer!  (Hitchcock and Chabrol would love this movie.)  But then a film crew shows up in town and has need of catering for a crew of thirty people.  So the restaurant reopens, and Raimunda goes to all her friends and the local open-air market for tons of food quickly.  And since she needs a real freezer, something needs to be done with the freezer with the dead body in it.  Meanwhile, auntie keeps showing up alive to people who helped bury her! <br /> <br />VOLVER is in Panavision, with yellow English subtitles below the letterboxed film image.  They are easy to read, but the film is talky so I missed maybe every other title.  Almodovar says, in a very good bonus interview, that he grew up in a family of women in La Mancha and is an agnostic who does not believe in reincarnation.  Hence, our one and only life is to be used to the fullest and death is not a sad occasion.  We see women cleaning grave markers and sweeping dust off tombs in a cemetery in the opening scene.  Anyway, I am not sure who is who here or who is really dead.  Almodovar fans should know that it is a wonderful, almost lighthearted dark comedy; and that Almodovar regular Carmen Maura is in it.  And Penelope Cruz deserved herOscar nomination. <br /> <br />Besides the Almodovar chat (in Spanish), DVD bonuses include two English-language interviews with Cruz and a Spanish-language one with Maura.  Viva, VOLVER! <br /> <br />
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The Nikon SB400 is light, well-constructed, fully-automatic, very easy to use, runs on a cheap pair of readily available AA batteries, takes bulls-eye flash exposures and affordable to boot! I bought this to have a little more punch to my flash photography and to lessen the load on the camera's battery. <br /> <br />At first I thought I would need a sophisticated speedlight, knowledge of manual flash calculations or whatever it is that other photographers seem to know that I don't to get great flash photos. I thought only the more expensive SB600 and SB800 can do this with current Nikon DSLRs as the builtin flash just doesn't cut it. Was I wrong! <br /> <br />When I saw Nikon the SB400 and read reviews about it I knew I found an effective alternative. It delivered the goods with the finesse and the elegance of simplicity. It works like magic! It doesn't compete with the camera for weight. I can slip it in and out easily. Most of all it does not require elaborate setup to give WOW! results.  With this speedlight I have shot portraits using bounce flash so natural my flattered friends thought it was only possible with ambient light. I have photographed small items up close without having a washed out image. I have used the excellent fill-in flash technique outdoors without worrying about over-expossure. I have easily used the SB400 as the main light at night without worrying of under-exposure. The results were just great! Unless you intentionally set out to mess it up it's hard to make a bad flash exposure with the SB400. Another feature I like is that, should I need more or less flash power than the default settings, I can easily adjust it on the camera. There are no other switches or buttons on the flash that I can possibly screw up. Perfect!   <br /> <br />When I need flash light I just slide in the SB400 on the hotshoe of my Nikon D40, switch the lock and switch it ON and I'm good to go! All I have to do is select my shooting mode and the SB400 takes care of the rest. The SB400 is sized and designed in such a way that I like having it around.  <br /> <br />Unless you are doing studio work or commercial location shooting (I am not), I couldn't think of any other situation that the SB400 will not fit nicely. But if you want more flash range, the facility to fine-tune the flash by hand or control flash remotely then you should consider the more expensive Nikon speedlights SB600 or SB800. <br /> <br />The Nikon SB400 fully covers my needs and it saved me money besides. An ideal pair for the D40. Highly Recommended!
0374105235|4.0|This is an amazing story about what so many kids have to endure but also about how much the human spirit can overcome. I found it a riveting book, although I thought the ending was a little abrubt and thought the writer sometimes skipped over details that I was really interested in knowing. For example, what was it like for him to be on an airplane for the first time? He describes what it was like to be on an elevator (which he had never seen or heard of before) but not the airplane. How did Mohammed end up living with his uncle & his family? How did he make it to NY? How did Mohammed end up in the US too? The book is really not long so I thought he could have easily added those details. <br /> <br />Still, I would highly recommend the book. It is an incredible story.

B00009MGGI|4.0|The wetworks get tedious but Sir Ian Richardson should get any and all voiceover work.  Sometimes I find English accents uncomfortable to listen to but his is just yummy.  He is also all voice in Alex Proyas' Dark City.<br /><br />Maddie's \\"Daddy\\" surprised and disgusted me and a lot of this series is intentionally unattractive.<br /><br />Despite the awesomeness of Ian Richardson's voice and line delivery, the character and the story itself is so hateful that like Mads Mikkelson's Hannibal Lecter, I became sick of the main character.
B000001E8P|5.0|Back in the mid 90's, I dismissed Pulp as just another BritPop band.  Come to find out, I was wrong.  A good friend gave this to me as a CD exchange and I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed. <br /> <br />The standout tracks are clearly (IMO) \\"Mis-Shapes\\", \\"Common People\\" and \\"I Spy\\".  The music is rather jangly and at times has a distinctly dance-able beat.  What won me over though were the lyrics.  Jarvis Cocker manages to create a fantastic mental image to go along with his lyrics, which are alternately humorous and serious, occassionally silly (\\"Sorted for E's and Wizz\\") and vaguely malevolent (\\"I Spy\\").  Cocker's delivery is very basic - he doesn't have a lot of range, but he makes good use of his voice and some of the spoken parts of the songs send chills up my spine. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great album.  I wish that I'd given it a chance back in 1995.

B0002XNT0I|5.0|If you are reading this review, you may have one of these 3 questions:<br /><br />1) Are the extras on this DVD worthwhile?  Yes, the documentaries not only remind us of the cultural mindsets that were dominant in the 1980s, but they also remind us of the sea change force this movie had on U.S. culture.  The two main documentaries are exceptional and Springstein's video reminds us why we listen intently to whatever Springstein has to say.<br /><br />2) Was Tom Hanks' performance worthy of the Oscar?  Watch the movie and decide for yourself.  Tom Hanks' understanding of pathos is lightning in a bottle.  It is uniquely gifted.  From the scenes talking to his mother on the phone, to defending his gay lover who's being threatened to be expelled from his hospital room, to his efforts to seek some basic human recognition (or call it justice) as his body is rapidly dying.<br /><br />3) Is the movie worth watching again or for the first time?  Yes, it is a well crafted movie.  Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, coming off his Best Director Oscar for Silence of the Lambs, he chose this project and he is in full form.  The movie moves quickly, with the pace of a thriller.  The story had universal morals that, before this film's release, had not been so well presented to such a mass audience.  Watching the acting performances gives a remarkable master class in understanding vocal demeanors, non-verbal cues, and concise word selection.<br /><br />The title of this review is a question asked to Tom Hanks' character as he is on the witness stand, defending himself while he knows he likely only has a few days left to live.  His response to the question is this:<br /><br />\\"I . . . many things . . . uh, what I love most about the law?  . . . Is that every now and again, not often . . . but occasionally you get to be a part of justice being done.  That really is quite a thrill when that happens.\\"<br /><br />This movie was also a part of justice being done.  It effectively helped change popular perceptions about AIDS & homosexuality.  It did more good than 100 winning court cases.  It disarmed so much stupid discrimination.<br /><br />Before this movie, as is quoted in the film, the following was true: \\"Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is protected as a handicap under the law, not only because of the physical limitations it imposes, but because the prejudice surrounding AIDS exacts a social death which precedes . . . which precedes the actual physical one.\\"<br /><br />After this movie, social perceptions about AIDS and the treatment of people with AIDS greatly improved, due in part to the artfulness and clarity of ideas beautifully expressed in this film.<br /><br />What do I love about the arts?  They have the ability to make practical, widespread cultural perceptual changes, changes that are more quickly and effectively enabled when the arts are allowed to be expressive and prominent.ality.

B000002IR7|4.0|This may not be worthy of 4 stars but its nearer that than 3 for me. These guys were the backing band in the sixties for the Stax/Volt labels. Most of the records you hear by Otis Redding, Sam & Dave etc had these guys playing, and theres a good reason for that, they are very good musicians.<br /><br />Everybody knows 'Green Onions', it remains a classic instrumental, apparently made-up in the studio. The cover of 'I Got A Woman' motors along, propelled by some infectious drumming from Al Jackson. A change of pace for track 6 gives the guys to show off their blues playing on 'Behave Yourself'. This is a lovely slow blues, which builds up a head of steam and gives Booker T a chance to show off his Hammond playing.<br /><br />Their are really only two reasons not to buy this album. Firstly the tracks are all instrumentals, so theres no point buying this if you like to listen to lyrics. Secondly the Hammond Organ sound Booker T uses a lot of the time does sound a little dated now (especially on 'Stranger on the Shore') and its used on most of the tracks. However contrary to the previous reviewers I found this to be an enjoyable album in its own right regardless of what the group did later in their career.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This nostalgic rendering of Rocky in his advancing years is a good ending to the series.  It is neither too fanciful nor too depressing.  Rocky is older and has grown in wisdom through the years.  This film does not try to recapture Rocky's youth.  It is a good film for aging baby boomers.  It is a must see for Rocky fans.  It is a little slow and sentimental for those who are not already Rocky fans.  If you like Rocky, watch the film.  If you are not a Rocky fan let it pass.

B000H7JD4K|5.0|The seminal NWOHM band returns to form unseen since at least the Seventh Son album with A Matter of Life and Death. This CD does what Maiden does best, what their die hard Metalhead fans expect; they are the hardest rocking \\"thinking man's metal\\" band of all time. Bruce's wailing over Steve and co.'s pounding rhythms simply cannot be duplicated. \\"For The Greater Good of God\\" shines as brightly as anything on Powerslave or Somewhere in Time. The five tracks with Dickinson/Harris/Smith credited as writers work particularly well, but I've always loved the contrast between Steve's songs and the Smith/Dickinson tracks. \\"Different World\\" kicks off the album ferociously, reminiscent of \\"Wicker Man\\" or \\"Aces High.\\"Unarguably, the tradition of complex material, masterful solos, and driving power carries on still.<br /><br />Building on Dance of Death's \\"Paschendale,\\" this weaves the themes of war, destruction, and religion- but it is not a concept album. I think this fits into the three album period Powerslave, Somewhere, and Seventh Son; this one may even be better through maturity. Their intelligence doesn't diminish how hard they still rock, no current band compares. I liked the last two studio albums, but this feels like an advancement, as well as a return to mid 80s form. Hopefully it will inspire new fans and bring back old ones. I've been an ardent loyalist since 1981, and my sons love them just as much.<br /><br />P.S. I like the cover better than Dance of Death's, but they've undeniably regressed.

I found the two other I attempted unreadable.<br />I would award \\"Kevin\\" five stars for a mockumentary--Shrivers' spitting in our faces, not just mildly pulling our legs, in so many and mysterious ways here that may or may not be obvious, but this is maybe the only way I can get a handle on her.<br />SHMMART, oh yes she is, I can't resist the cliche, too smart for her own good. Its like having one of those \\"X\\" Girls with super powers coming at you. She hasn't figured out whether to use her powers for good or ill, and in \\"Kevin\\" all she can do is do both.<br />I look at the different photos of her on her books, \\"Double Fault,\\" she looks like an innocent angel, don't believe it. My favorite was in the paperback of \\"Kevin\\" I read. She looks at you, waif like, head cocked to the side, she might just have escaped from the funny-farm, and she's either saying, \\"help me,\\" or, \\"you better watch it, buster.\\"<br />She's an inscrutable joy I love to behold. As a writer I wish her a long and happy, not so easy I think, life.
B000M4RG42|5.0|This, together with Letters from Iwo Jima, should be praised as a true history lesson in a compact format.<br /><br />I bought this movie just while waiting the release of Letters from Iwo Jima.<br /><br />Now, as I understand it, on May 22nd there will be a 5-disc special edition boxed set released, that will not only contain both movies, but tons of extras, including the making of both movies, led by Actor-Director Clint Eastwood himself, as well as a fifth special disc, which will include a History Channel Documentary on that Battle and a second documentary as well.<br /><br />So,  if you want to kill some time, as I usually do, buy \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" now. For its price it is well worth it, but comes with no extras whatsoever.<br /><br />Then, on May 22, you may really want to dig in, and get this 5-disc special edition of both movies.<br /><br />I think that for the true historian in all of us, seeing for the first time ever, a story of one of the bloodiest Battles in World War II from both perspectives is a unique experience to say the least.<br /><br />Maybe, if one day somebody could come up with an original idea of this type, concerning the Battle of Huertgen Forest, probably one of the bloodiest ones on the Western Front, except maybe for Stalingrad and Operation Bagration, but which saw U.S. Troops opposed by German Guns, then we would have a somewhat complete picture of what that bloody war was perceived even in Europe, from both perspectives (Germans were as scared as the U.S. troops, since they knew perfectly well that if they had lost this Battle, the doors to Germany would finally be wide open to the Allies).<br /><br />Anyway, back to \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\". It is made documentary style, a bit like \\"Band of Brothers\\", in which you have survivors talking about their experiences and reliving them through the movie itself.<br /><br />The photography is a bit crude, but I think that for a movie like this one, having it in soft tones, would have falsified the sense of harshness and hostility that pervaded that piece of rock.<br /><br />Also interesting is the sarcastic if not ironic part on who's who, in planting the Flag on top of that famous mound on Iwo Jima.<br /><br />As if from this depended the victory of the Allies over the Japanese Imperial Forces.<br /><br />Go figure the ridiculous logic behind otherwise so much serious and tragic facts. While people get their limbs blown off their bodies, there is a bureaucrat somewhere, trying to find out who the heck the guy was, who actually did plant that Flag...<br /><br />Perhaps, if we had sent those idiots into the war, especially as reconnaissance officers, we would have gotten rid of some useless people, whose specialty is to sharpen pencils all day long.<br /><br />This is a beautiful movie, well made, and despite the lack of Big Names a la Hollywood, it is very well acted in a very naturalistic way and this seems to be Clint Eastwood's personal touch.<br /><br />Don't forget that Clint was a relatively unknown actor himself when he suddenly became famous with the Dollar Trilogy and the Man with No Name. Although he appeared in various episodes of \\"Rawhide\\", he never truly made it as a major actor until then.<br /><br />This is probably also the way he pays his dues back, and let me say, he works with these actors in the most beautiful way. You can tell that these guys, if they have it within them, will one day become \\"somebodies\\", rather than just stay forever as \\"unknown\\" actors.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great history lesson told by a master in movie making.<br /><br />I can recommend it to anyone seriously interested in World War II.would have falsified the sense of harshness and hostility that pervaded that piece of rock. <br /> <br />Also interesting is the sarcastic if not ironic part on who's who, in planting the Flag on top of that famous mound on Iwo Jima. <br />As if from this depended the victory of the Allies over the Japanese Imperial Forces. <br /> <br />Go figure the ridiculous logic behind otherwise so much serious and tragic facts.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|This is a good movie with comments to make on many levels.  It shows the heartache that one couple has to overcome after losing a child.  There is a certain poetic justice about the stupidity of a nanny putting herself in jeopardy, a pleasant, caring woman who has been breaking the law for 16 years.  Then there is the story of two boys who play their rifle games oblivious to what harm they are doing to other people, completely innocent people.   Does their culture create people, even young ones, who are so irresponsible?  Today's newspapers confirm the film's answer . . a resounding yes.  And, attached to the film's plot by a very slender thread, the Japanese girl has pain that can be felt by everyone watching her, including the audience.    I wouldn't necessarily call this film enjoyable, but it is an enlightening and mesmerizing film.  It also has probably the best role that Brad Pitt has ever had or played.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|OK, it is not fully material filmed by Richard Donner himself. Some has been lost in the cutting room, but it is still far superior to the Richard Lester's version.<br /><br />We finally get Part II of \\"Superman - The Movie\\". This would mean that in reality, the Superman saga, is in three chapters, like a Trilogy.<br /><br />Superman III, becoming truly Superman II and The Quest for Peace, Superman III and not IV.<br /><br />I also found far more interesting the continuity in the Fortress of Solitude, which offers us further insights in Kal-El's education by his Father Jor-El (played by Marlon Brando), and initiated on his far journey from Krypton to Earth in part One.<br /><br />The bit with Susannah York, being suddenly his mentor and teacher, instead of Jor-El, was very strange and never fully explainable.<br /><br />The picture is far better outlined and the pace, at least for the first half of it, is far tighter, than Lester's version.<br /><br />I actually prefer Donner's vision and from now on I will only play Lester's as a comparison piece.<br /><br />The DVD picture transfer is as good as the \\"Superman -The Movie\\" Special Edition one, which makes it very enjoyable since they are both the very same movie.<br /><br />Some reviewer noticed that there were actual quality differences between the material shot by Donner and the one by Lester. I could not find any such differences, and if there may be some, they are totally unnoticeable while watching the movie.<br /><br />Naturally, this is the opinion of somebody who rather get involved with the plot, rather than with visual characteristics, but if I had noticed something obvious appearing on screen, I would have been the first one to get shocked, but no, nothing major appeared on my HD screen.<br /><br />Concerning sound we receive with both DVDs a decent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, compared to Lester's flat Dolby Digital Surround, which is equivalent to a Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround.<br /><br />Believe me, I don't usually like to be taken for a ride with special gimmicks like DeLuxe Editions and the like, but this version is worth every penny, and if don't already own the entire 8 to 14 DVD collection and you don't want the other movies, this is the additional one you ought to buy.<br /><br />It is up to you, but Marlon Brando reprising his role as Jor-El is well worth the extra effort.lieve me, I don't usually like to be taken for a ride with special gimmicks like DeLuxe Editions and the like, but this version is worth every penny, and if don't already own the entire 8 to 14 DVD collection and you don't want the other movies, this is the additional one you ought to buy. <br /> <br />It is up to you, but Marlon Brando reprising his role as Jor-El is well worth the extra effort.
0975991477|4.0|The biology of Belief: unleashing the power of consciousness, matter, and miracles<br /><br />By Bruce Lipton<br /><br />It's an odd book, hard to classify, even harder to grasp the big picture for which the author argues passionately and rather well. The genre is akin to such books as: The Tao of Physics, Dancing Wu-Li Masters, except the science being rewritten is biology rather than physics.The author uses the words: \\"new biology\\" consciously to refer to a new paradigm, a system that is more holistic, much less reductionist, more consciousness, less matter in motion. The author is best described, i think, as a teacher that learns his first and most important lessons from looking at himself, much of the book is prompted by inner turmoil, cognitive dissonance and his attempts to reconcile his experience and his scientific education. As such it makes the book not really about biology, although there is lots of it, but rather about how this man looks out from inside his head and sees the reflection of his consciousness in the world. And from there tries to explain what he has found in terms of modern molecular biochemistry but finds that this is just the beginning and so much more is left unexplored because modern science is blinded by a materialist paradigm that depreciates consciousness.<br /><br />I think that the book is best read like a detective novel, from the 1st page to the last, with an occasional glance at the end of the chapter to see who-dun-it. The personal nature of the writing makes it difficult just to take a chapter out of context and read it for informational content, although one might be tempted to because of the extensiveness of the science. This would be a mistake because the science is not self contained but rather is being used by the author as an explantory way to unify what often appear to be spiritual issues and questions and finding their potential answer in biology.<br /><br />For example, chapter 3: the magical membrane. The first paragraph is: \\"Now that we've looked at the protein assembly machinery of the cell, debunked the notion that the necleus is the brain of the cellular operation, and recognized that crucial role the environment plays in the operation of the cell, we're on to the good stuff-the stuff that can make sense of your life and give your insight into ways of changing it.\\" pg75 This is one of the major themes of the book, the cell is not controlled and run exclusively by the nucleus and it's DNA but rather is a complex interaction of the environment and the cell, mediated by receptors in the membrane. Which is a microcosm of the theme of the book, which appears in the last paragraph of this chapter: \\"which put the control of our lives not in the genetic roll of the dice at conception, but in our own hands\\" pg 94 This is consistent with the book's theme that the mind-body division is fundamentally wrong, reflected in the division of physics into Newtonian and Quantum, and biology as fixing machinery versus straightening out mental or even spiritual issues, this is where the idea that the quantum revolution in physics needs to be carried out in modern biology and seeing the importance of energy vs matter.<br /><br />I've stumbled trying to write this review for weeks. I finished the book the day after i checked it out of the library(it is a good read, the analogy to a mystery is true), but here it sits, the review unfinished weeks later. Why is it so hard to review? What makes it such an odd book?<br /><br />It is my difficulty in separating the garbage of the new age movement from it's treasure. My problem of differentiating what is good in the book, what is worth pursuing and learning more about, from the general spiritualist, god is in everything pantheism that the author is heading towards (apparently).<br /><br />I like the science he presents, i appreciate the goals of reducing the reductionism, dematerializing the gross materialism, and spiritualizing the sciences, but i am concerned that the content of his spirituality is very different and in competition with my orthodox conservative Christianity. It is this loggerheads that makes an analysis of the ideas in the book so hard. I am not a pan or a panentheist, God is not part of His creation but wholely other. And to deify creation, to find our consciousness, our imago dei in the physical universe is not the right way to go. But it is a useful thing to see how someone with this author's spiritual sensitivity walk us through his adventures and share with us his journey. This is a good thing and makes the book a high recommendation for me. I'm just afraid that anything i say about what the book is about will really be more about me and my reaction than that of the author, rats.<br /><br />Biology has missed the crucial contribution of the environment. This is chapter 2, \\"It's the environment, stupid\\". As no man is an island, no cell in an organism, no organism in it's lifetime, no community, is an island, separated from the rest of life. The next chapter,\\"the magical membrane\\" is his scientific analysis of why DNA is not the king of the cell controlling everything and responsible for all, but he looks at the membrane as the communication center from the cell to it's environment. Here he is probably not only right but a good antidote to the nucleus-centric thinking that dominates cell and molecular biology. The 4th chapter, \\"the new physics\\" is a quick analysis of energy and quantum mechanics as a new physics paradigm that basically says something like: energy is all, matter is but energy in a different form. This chapter is the one most like the Tao of Physics and that genre. The next chapter, \\"biology and belief\\" makes the analogy of energy to spirit and matter to physical world and tries to drawn a new biology akin to the new physics. IF you  can only read a few pages, pick this chapter, it is the key ideas of the book.<br /><br />Is it true, does our mind control the physics around us? is it true that god is energy and spirit and accessible to the mind of man? how much of the new biology is the old pagan spirituality, the worship of mother earth and the forces of nature? i don't know. but i'm interesting in reading more.i am concerned that the content of his spirituality is very different and in competition with my orthodox conservative Christianity.

B00005JPPI|3.0|\\"Primal Fear\\" director, Gregory Hoblit's legal cat and mouse game between veteran actor Anthony Hopkins and promising newcomer Ryan Gosling could have been a psychological thriller of Hitchcockian proportions, but to many fissures in either the editing phase or the overall concept make this \\"Fracture\\" borderline abysmal.<br /><br />Like a kaleidoscope, all the elements exist and combine to create a shimmering bent-ray look into the perfect crime.  From the onset, the audience comprehends fully that Crawford (Hopkins) killed his adulterous wife and somehow perhaps because in this role Hopkins perfects and tempers with a knowing sadness that familiar megalomaniacal ingeniousness spawned during his Academy Award winning enactment of Hannibal Lector we empathize with Pavlovian fascination, wishing with all of our might that Crawford beats the rap in spite of the wrongness of his transgression.<br /><br />If Hannibal Lector suggests the sophisticated power of a warped mind, the character of Crawford explores similar territory.  In Hopkins deft hands, Crawford smolders with nuance that begs to be investigated.  We know Crawford is riddled with fractures---fractures from his childhood, his adult past and his obviously failed marriage.  The incidentals need not be detailed; the beauty of Hopkin's performance makes disclosure unnecessary.<br /><br />Like Lector, Crawford simply is and he's got the high-dollar items to back up and accentuate his success on various mind and achievement levels.  As head of his own aerodynamics company, his organized mind can see and arrange the components of his life from the perspective of a higher vantage point--- his accoutrements illicit an affluent privacy: he lives in a gate-contained cushy California crib, drives a fantastic sports car, tinkers with magnificent Rube Goldberg contraptions (kudos to Dutch artist Mark Bischoff) and possesses an off-the-chart IQ for which any Mensa might, well, kill.  Unfortunately, one of his acquisitions isn't going along with the program; wife Jennifer has set up house with her police inspector boyfriend.  Within the first five minutes of the film, Crawford takes care of this blot on his brand of perfection with a quick bullet to her brain, rendering her comatose.<br /><br />Enter the perfect rub, public defender-protagonist, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling).  Young and hungry, Will is about to shun his inbred liberal/Democrat/socialistic values and embrace \\"the dark side\\"---accepting a position with a posh-y firm the type of which caused Will Shakespeare to utter in Henry VI, \\"Let's kill all the lawyers.\\"  Older and wiser Crawford immediately sizes up his competition as being distracted by his imminent career transition and the open and shut case that the DA expects disintegrates into an entertaining farce where Crawford maintains the upper hand with a most sadistic yet unassuming calmness that belies the partial deadness of the soul beneath. Gosling needs to regroup fast before he puts a permanent blot on his win-only record and blows his chances for his greed driven dreams.<br /><br />The script's overall concentration on Gosling's character unfortunately falls prey to many of Hollywood's formulaic pitfalls.  Hoblit should have emulated great suspense thrillers like \\"Deathtrap\\" or \\"Sleuth\\" and left out characters that do little to enhance the plot.  In this instance, ice blonde Rosamund Pike as Gosling's new boss becomes merely an ornament decorating Gosling's roguish manliness rather than a personality important to driving the plot.  Her family reiterates the socialist message while they sip expensive wine during Thanksgiving dinner that anyone with a mindset slightly akin to \\"Wall Street's\\" Gordon Gekko condones and enables Big Corporate Evil.  But none of that has anything to do with the intricate mind game that could have been played and relished by the two main characters.<br /><br />Likewise the plot's loose ends eventually tarnish the film's trite outcome.  Isuppose the concentration on the poorly constructed subplots distracts the audience from fully analyzing some of the hints, snafus and gaffs but do not create enough background noise to stop one from realizing that the lover's compromising of the evidence on the Crawford property and at the crime lab would have provided Crawford with yet another interesting gambit to play.<br /><br />Bottom line:  In true Hollywood fashion, the film's ultimate significance lies in some unwanted political message about big business versus social awareness rather than the ultimate mind game that it purports to be.  The film entertains and generates conversation, but its structural fractures downplay the interplay between minds that this reviewer would have found much more satisfying.<br /><br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br /><br />\\"reneofc\\"trite outcome.

B000003TA4|2.0|I want to say firstly that simply because an album is overrated does not neccessarily make it a bad album. I own plenty of overrated albums and I love them. They tend to be overrated for a reason. In this case I believe this album's impact is undeniable (for good or for bad) however it's content is almost ridiculously overrated, overhyped, and almost delusionally worshipped. I don't hate Nirvana or Kurt Kobain. I believe when they were recording this album they were just doing what they do. By the late 80's people were so freakin' sick of hair bands that the grunge movement was almost innevitable. But I still don't understand how the grunge movement could be seen as revolutionary. Rock n roll has alway been on a constant cycle. Rock n roll started out in the 1950's as simple three chord songs. In the 1960's rock became more sophisticated and actually became art. In the 1970's rock continued to progress but at times became overly ambitious and pretensious and that led to the retaliation of the punk movement in the late 70's and the new wave movement in the early 80's. By the late 1980's rock had been flooded by hair metal and then was killed by grunge. Yes Nevermind did put an end to the hair metal era. So what? The hair metal thing would have run it's course eventually and might have even morphed itself into something more interesting. Rock is continually on a roller coaster anyway. One minute it is okay to make ambitious complex rock and the next minute three chord songs are the only \\"honest\\" music. I have to say that these trends are generally opressive and have more to do with corporations than they do with the musicians. I personally believe rock can be sophisticated and accessible and honest all at the same time. By now we should have had another \\"revolution\\" one that makes it okay to do great ambitious rock. However, believe it or not the corporations who have a stranglehold on the music business are still reaping the benefits of Nevermind.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It saddens me to see people, especially Tool fans, not being able to see the beauty of this album. It is more melodic, darker, somber, but in turn more introspective than an externalization of problems/feelings. I am somewhat bias b/c I'm a huge fan of APC, and they represent what 10,000 Days seems to be expressing - not just the masculinity of feelings, such as angst and hostility, but also examining our feminine side (as anima/aenima refers to). I love the mysteriousness of this album, almost gypsy-like in some parts and native american in others - it feels very indigenous, pure, honest. I have to admit that my favorite song is Intentions b/c of it taking me to another level in mind and spirit. I think it's also important to remember that this is a band that has focused more on the music rather than the lyrics. yes, the lyrics are amazing and i love maynard's sound, but it's the music that gives you chills or makes the hair stand on the back of your neck. and to a point, it's more of the sound of his voice than what he says that is important for me. i love the lyrics for their political and social stances; however, i absolutely love where the music takes me - no need for drugs, just a natural high.  <br /> <br />Anyhow, I love this album, I think that this band continues to push the boundaries of what constitutes rock music, especially in a time when rock music is absolutely horrible. Keep thinking, exploring, and growing!
0783229372|3.0|Based on true historic events and some conjectured documents come to light in recent years, this may be one of the possible reasons of the catastrophy that befell the legendary \\"Hindenburg\\", pride and joy of the Third Reich at the time.<br /><br />The cast is stellar for its times, including George C. Scott, Anne Bancroft, Gig Young, Charles Durning and a young William Atherton and many others.<br /><br />But alas, George C. Scott, as a German intelligence Officer is a bit weak and compared with other roles he masterfully played, such as Patton (twice, in \\"Patton\\" and \\"The Last Days of Patton\\"), or even Mussolini, totally seems out of place. He seems bored with the part, rather than playing it to the hilt.<br /><br />Anne Bancroft as a Jewish German aristocrat, fleeing her home country, plays her role well, but you never get the sense that she truly has to fight for her life.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is professional, but lacks luster.<br /><br />Even the actors playing the Gestapo henchmen, seem totally miscast and weak.<br /><br />Except for a couple of very tense scenes towards the end of the movie, everything seems centered on the \\"flying\\" model of the Hindenburg.<br /><br />At the end, and thank Heaven's for that, the producers decided to include some vintage - cleaned up - material of the actual disaster, intertwining it with studio filmed recreations of the panic and mayhem it caused.<br /><br />In scope, the picture could have been a masterpiece, if only the characters had been recast and the story a bit more thrilling.<br /><br />Suppose they had cast Maximilian Schell as the Intelligence Officer and Derren Nesbitt (remember him as SS-Sturmbannf&uuml;hrer Von Hapen in \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" or as Colonel Hartmann in \\"The Naked Runner\\"), or even Karl-Otto Alberty (as Major von Diepel in \\"Battle of the Bulge\\", or the German Tiger Tank Commander in \\"Kelly's Heroes\\") as his Gestapo Nemesis, and you would have had a true and murderous Thriller in your hands.<br /><br />Also, although I admire William Atherton's work as an actor, he simply never takes a bite at his role, as the main saboteur suspect. I am sure that Andrew Robinson, Ian Bannen or Tom Courtney would have made a far more convincing suspect.<br /><br />All in all this is a watchable movie, although it takes a lot of liberties with historical facts, even if just down memory lane, to meet again some old glories at their peak of their respective careers.<br /><br />It would also have helped, if before transferring this movie to DVD, they had cleaned up the special effects, which remain untouched and it shows.<br /><br />The sound is mere Stereo, when we all know that the original presentation was in a Surround sound, which greatly enhanced the passages of the overflying Hindenburg and the sounds of its engines passing by.<br /><br />A very weak effort by Universal to present its own glories in their digitalized format.<br /><br />Like \\"Midway\\" and \\"MacArthur\\", Universal just slams their pictures on DVD as is.<br /><br />They don't care to clean up defects, streaks, jumps, or even to check color continuity. Their movies, especially those of the mid-seventies, which especially in their epic and monumental ones, were originally produced with a Sensurround process are simply transferred with a 2-channel mono process.<br /><br />While I can understand that reprocessing multi-channel Sensurround sound can be an expensive affair, especially when editing it with new digital 5.1 Dolby sound, and perhaps even in DTS process, I as a marketing consultant, would refrain them from releasing such movies in the state they are in nowadays, unless we had the money to restore them as they originally were shown.<br /><br />Also missing from this release, and which was included in the LaserDisc of many moons ago, is a Black & White 60 minutes documentary on the evolution of the Zeppelin and the full story of the historic Hindenburg flights.<br /><br />Why this is suddenly missing,is as much your guess as mine.<br /><br />But for the price, what could you ask more? It is just 9 dollars, and for this price anything is right, although I would have wished for something more, even if at a higher price.<br /><br />This choice is yours.

Eaten with kids one meal per day at the St Vincent de Paul's, sold plasma, lived on the streets. It was not a pleasant movie by any means, i left the room several times. I can admire his drive, often i wish i had that kind of ambition, or recently that my kids had it.<br /><br />But the movie was, for me, like that old joke: the pilot comes on the loudspeaker and says, i got good news and i got bad news. The good news is that we are making excellent time, the bad news is that we are completely lost.<br /><br />The movie presents the high side and the low side of economic life in this culture. The main character traverses this spectrum on his way down. Yet his salvation is his perseverance, his ability to sacrifice everything but his son for the task at hand---getting through the internship and grabbing the brass ring of money, and influence, and power and all good things that flow from this trinity.<br /><br />He doesn't seem to question the monetization of all relationships. He loses a friend over a $14 debt, his wife lives because she wants a provider not a dreamer. But most importantly he nevers seems to questions the structure, the way things are. Why is the internship unpaid, they make plenty of money for the business, it is little different that that rabbit at the dogtrack, a distant carrot to incite a herculean effort to achieve it. Why are so many smart, hard working, educated people racing with the rats? when they really must know that 5% is a high percentage of winners. And what do they really win? and what do they sacrifice? what does the society sacrifice when all relationships are monetized? When a ballgame is just another way to meet people to sell them things or services or whatever?<br /><br />The business of America is business. phewy, life is not about making money, and he ought to have realized that when his wife left and when he hugs his kid. Friendships are not about selling things, but about sharing. But we live in a society where tupperware parties happen in the church, where phone numbers and bank statements are interchangable, for people become commodities, to be bought and sold in the ever expanding marketplace.<br /><br />Sure it was a touching movie, i remember our rule #1: the family stays together. Certainly a large number of people are: one marital fight from the street, or one paycheck, or one commission sale. or 2 plasma sales this week. or a cart full of aluminum cans. The question is not how a single person can rise above such and make a multimillion sale, but why we created and sustain this stupid economy that grinds down not just the poor but everyone. That grinds up the things of this world to make unneccessary bone density machines and then sells them as a dream. Movies can tell us a lot about ourselves, the fact that a black man, a single father, living on the streets, can make it in the white monied world of stockbrokers and penthouse suites at the ballgame is a tribute to the way America has changed. But more importantly how it's dreams of a good life have infected all people here, not just those descented from the recent elites. But more importantly how you could have a movie showing this life, from a bright and talented man's viewpoint and yet not at all challenge the circumstances of his life and why things are the way they are.<br /><br />That is my big issue with the movie, so he gets ahead and makes lots of money. Doesn't he feel anything for those who didn't? Doesn't he have a real relationship with any of the bums in the shelter? or are they incapable of being leads and prospects. It's a good movie, worthwhile watching, but i really would like to have seen some thoughtful challenge of circumstances not just the perseverance to overcome them.wy, life is not about making money, and he ought to have realized that when his wife left and when he hugs his kid.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|This film begins promisingly, with two naive American guys and their Icelandic friend backpacking through Europe, searching for cheap drugs and hot chicks. Then they meet a Slavic sex hound (Alexis) who promises them hot, gorgeous, free women who are sex starved in Slovenia and just waiting for them. Of course, like most horny young guys, they follow this advice and go to the dead end town where they do indeed find absolutely gorgeous (and thankfully, often topless) Slovenian chickies who seem to drop their pants for any man who happens to be foreign. Cut to the chase, Iceland dude disappears and the Yanks start to become suspicious (but not enough to up and leave right away). This, of course, leads to them being kidnapped and sold into a sadistic torture fetish underground warehouse where only one of them comes out alive. I know that this sounds quite exciting (as it did to me when I had read the cover of the film) but the actual film is rather slow moving and leaves too many unanswered questions. The lighting is very dark so you actually see very little (sometimes thankfully) inside the torture chambers. Pretty pathetic horror film, in my opinion. However, the ending is very poetic and is a great payoff for those who had stuck out the entire 95 minutes.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|If you haven't seen this film yet,  do so - if for no other reason than to see one of the most beautifully photograhed films in years. Director/Producer Ridley Scott uses Provence, France, as the visually intoxicating backdrop for this smart, romantic comedy, while Director of Photography Philippe Le Sourd plants us in the middle of a beautiful painting as we watch the story unfold.  <br /> <br />\\"A Good Year\\" is perfectly cast, with Albert Finney, Freddie Highmore and Abbie Cornish in key roles. Russell Crowe, perhaps the industry's finest dramatic actor, proves without a doubt the former Gladiator does indeed have a softer, more gentle side to him; some viewers may be surprised at how well Crowe moves effortlessly from one scene to another, displaying a gift for the timing and flare that is so crucial to a successful comedy. Considering his body of work as a serious dramatic actor, this film is a nice change of pace for him - and an enjoyable one at that. <br /> <br />For those who have seen the film and found it a bit hard to follow, it is important to remember that intelligent, well thought out scripts, like this one by Marc Klein, require the viewer to pay a little more attention than usual in order to better grasp the thought process behind the film's direction. I found the inspirational conversations between Finney and Freddie Highmore ( who plays Crowe as a young boy) to be particularly thought-provoking and well-written.  <br /> <br />Like most DVDs these days, \\"A Good Year\\" includes a director's commentary. Some are good, while others simply put you to sleep. That said, I have to say that I have never enjoyed a commentary as much as I did this one (\\"Gladiator\\" comes in a close second). Ridley Scott provides us with a new commentary format that includes a \\"feature-length hybrid of video featurettes\\" that accompany his and screenwriter Klein's comments. I say 'new\\" because I had never experienced this form of commentary before. Nevertheless, I found it to bevery entertaining and much more informative than most.   <br /> <br />Bottom line: If you're a big Russell Crowe fan, and enjoy good comedy set in a beautiful, European backdrop, this one's for you. And, while you're at it, you might just learn a thing or two about the wine business, to boot.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I have to admit, I was worried that this could not be done...I thought it couldn't be believable...that Rocky was just too old...but I have to say, I was wrong.  This film was a wonderful tribute to Rocky's humble beginnings.  I loved the music, seeing all the old places again...it brought me back to when I first saw Rocky as a little girl.  Try this one, even if you have your doubts.  You won't be disappointed.  The only sad thing about the movie was that Adrian was gone, but even that added something special to the nostalgic look back at where Rocky began.
0974869449|5.0|This is the kind of product that makes me wish Max Hodges and Tomoko Okazaki had been in business 30 years ago, when I spent a university year in Tokyo.  I've been back to Japan a few times since, but never before have I felt better prepared as with the language products of White Rabbit Press.  It's hard to improve on what other reviewers have said, except to suggest a visit to the White Rabbit Press web page, which itself is a wonderful resource.  I'm also studying from Kanji Flashcards, Volume 2; Nihongo Journal; and a question and answer book based on the official Japanese Language Proficiency Tests.
B00005JO20|1.0|This movie was made to appeal to those with an intelligence level in the mid thirties.  The film itself is a take off on the original Kong film with Fay Wray.  The original was one of the greatest films ever made.  This one is nothing but an embarassment to Peter Jackson who has done better work.  Why anyone ever thought to make this piece of trash is beyond me.  This is one movie which I gave a lower rating to than Jeepers Creepers.  I never thought I would see a movie that would accomplish that feat.  This movie was so bad that I wouldn't sit through it if I had a gun to my head.  I would beg them to shoot me so as to put me out of my misery.
0316166685|5.0|The premise of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is that a Susie, a young 15-year-old girl (or is she 14...?) is brutally raped murdered in a field near her house. The book is narrated by this girl, who, after her death, looks down from heaven on her family and lovingly but sadly watches them change and grow and attempt to heal the hole she has left behind.<br /><br />As with any piece of fiction involving supernatural elements, it is necessary to suspend any disbelief you may have regarding the plot in order to enjoy this beautiful and intricate piece of literature. It is hard to believe that a book which begins its first chapter with brutal violence can be so well-written, but it is! Although the rape/murder jars you when the book begins, if you continue to read, you will find yourself coming to grips with the painful truth along with the rest of Susie's family, as well as healing from its harsh reality.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Alice Sebold's raw, honest, and haunting style of writing captures you from the first page, drawing you into an entirely believable American suburb and into Susie's personal version of heaven.<br /><br />I loved being able to watch Susie's family change after her death, as well as experiencing her frustration at loving them but continuing on apart from them (something which Sebold writes particularly well).<br /><br />This is a stunning first novel, and one that bears many resemblances to Sebold's memoir \\"Lucky\\", which details her personal experience with rape and its aftermath (and which I also highly recommend!!)
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I just got this CD, but when I listened to it I discovered in seconds that this edition is EDITED! Beware, donload this album from ITunes or get the DVD advance copy. There's nothing worse than listening to edited music. Do not get this edition unless you are a small child. I returned my copy ASAP.<br /><br />Other than that, I recommend the album, there are ballads as well as the usual rock songs and the subject matter rotates from love to how guys are just jerks.
1582701709|5.0|I can't remember a book in this lifetime that as affected so many people.  So simple yet so profound!  I heard the dvd is better than the book, I'll have to see for myself. My favorite chapter was \\"The Secret to Money\\" which I read over and over.  Jack Canfield said he was working with a teacher who told him to set a goal so big that if he achieved it, it would blow his mind.  So Jack said he wanted to make a $100,000 in a year.   He even took a fake $100,000 bill and planted it on his ceiling.   He ended up selling not $100,000 in books but $92,000 which was close enough!  I myself needed to raise $10,000 to finance a relocation, and new place.  I printed a fake $10,000 bill off the net and did the same.  And what do you know, Presto.  I had the cash before my birthday, which was my target moving date.  Before I read \\"The Secret\\" I was struggling with depression, getting in shape and promoting my online business.  I learn that when you give your mind a goal it finds the solution.  Remember that old trick in college?  If you have a question you can't answer, sleep on it and when you wake up you have the answer?  That worked everytime because what you were doing is programming your subconscious to find the answer.  I just started meditating on the questions.  I quickly found information sources that helped me.  The \\"Happiness Now\\" book by Robert Holden zapped my depression instantly.   [...]

0671027344|5.0|Even if you are not a teenager! If you have been or currently are a teenage you will relate to Charlie's story. This book was amazing. Charlie is such a complex character and so very relatable.  I loved him, and I wish the story continued on. Get this book!
B000002HPV|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out and I can listen to it today and feel like I am listening to it for the first time. The way they put the music together and her voice is just beautiful. I have never heard anything like before. I think this is her best album ever. I was little disappointed with her lastest cds but that was because I compared it to this one. This cd is a good release. Feel alittle down or stress pop this cd in and let the emotions come out. Let the music take over you. I think every Bjork fan should have this cd. It is a must have!!!!! Oh, I love the cover!!! I think that is the best album cover.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|I was told about this film by a friend so I thought I would give it a go and purchase it.....I was not disappointed.  <br />It slows down a bit halfway but thats only as it is so full on to begin with. <br />The opening scenes do not leave anything at all to the imagination...check this one out!!!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Mark's unique songs and soothing voice paired with Emmylou's never disappointing talent makes this album the best Comfort Music I've heard in years. I played it non-stop last week when I had to drive 450 miles in one day and never once thought about listening to anything else.  Each song is a treat, but \\"All the Roadrunning\\" and \\"Love and Happiness\\" truly shine.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|In my 1-3-2007 review of the Harry Potter DVD series, I said about Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's direction of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that \\"perhaps Cuar&oacute;n held back from doing his own thing\\" because Chris Columbus had directed the previous Harry Potter releases and had oversight to Azkaban. Well the notion that Cuar&oacute;n was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.<br /><br />Cuar&oacute;n can indeed make a great movie and could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness clearly shines through when Cuar&oacute;n is turned loose with \\"his own\\" film, and Children of Men is a good example.<br /><br />Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what Cuar&oacute;n does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar nominated Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n).<br /><br />In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth, and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28 Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I was reminded of throughout Children of Men.<br /><br />Cuar&oacute;n adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through.<br /><br />Clive Owen leads the cast, and this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in A-list performances.<br /><br />A fair amount of action. Suspense. A very well-told story....Everything that you need to keep you entertained. And, hey, did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for Children of Men? You don't get that too often anymore.
0062502174|3.0|At its beginning I thought this book was interesting and fast moving. Santiago, the protagonist, sells his sheep and sets out to find treasure hidden near the pyramids in Egypt. However,the story soon begins to take on an airy fairy quality. Had it not been a short book I would have dumpted it at this point. What with hawks, omens and the strange encounter with the horseman, who is the alchemist, the story becomes even more painful. Occasionally there are a few profound truths which I appreciated - e.g. if you give in to your fears you won't be able to talk to your heart (pg. 143) but then the story would immediately return to the unrealistic like Santiago turning himself into the wind, talking to the desert, the wind and the sun. Aouch!
0345440927|4.0|this isn't as good as the baby whisperer, or maybe it's just not as insightful, but that's likely due to the fact that i don't need as much guidance now as the parent of a toddler as i did when i had a newborn and read the baby whisperer. i like that she has a quiz in the beginning of this book, as she did in \\"baby.\\" it really helped me get in touch with some issues & forced me to concentrate- which can sometimes be difficult when you have a frazzled day parenting a toddler. as i did in the baby whisperer book, i'll take the quiz again later and see how my child has changed and what i need help with then. ms. hogg is very nurturing and calming. i'm so sad to hear that she died. i was heartbroken, because i was really looking forward to her help in a few years when my toddler becomes a teenager!
B000EQICIM|4.0|DEADWING is a winner. I read the sparse negative reviews too, but think they are way off base. As many have emphasized, this is an album that bears repeated listening to fully appreciate. It may not completely grab your the first few listens, but will be be hooked sooner than later. After listening to it for a while, it still does not quite grab me like other some other PT releases (hence the loss of a star) but it is still an amazing mucical effort.<br /><br />I bought my album from the PT website and it is a special dual disc deluxe edition with 70+ page booklet and 2nd DVD audio version of the album in 5.1. This IS the way to hear this album! Steve has worked his aural magic once again, even more so than his 5.1 remastering of In Absentia. It is truly audio bliss. Any self respecting fan with the right equipment NEEDS to own this version! I cannot say for sure if this Japanese edition is in 5.1 but would think it is not since it uses the 2 CDs for all the extra tracks (over the European and American releases).<br /><br />Since this album has been so well coverd by others, let me just say, if you are a fan, you probably already own this or should. If you are new to the group, get Lightbulb Sun first if you like the lighter stuff, or In Absentia if you like your music a little heavier. Being a long-time fan, it is hard to imagine starting out with Deadwing, but newcomers to PT could do a lot worse.<br /><br />All in all a worthy addition to the PT canon and 5 big stars for one of the best albums of 2005.  If you are a rabbid fan or collector, then this Japanese edition with its extra tracks should satiate you...for a while.  ;']
B000NA28A2|5.0|Por descuido de mi parte no hab&iacute;a podido zambullirme en este nuevo CD de Juan Luis Guerra. &iexcl;Cu&aacute;nto lo lamento!<br /><br />Tengo sentimientos mezclados al escucharlo, pero la mezcla de los mismos es un caldo de alegr&iacute;a, satisfacci&oacute;n... y l&aacute;grimas de felicidad. Creo que desde \\"Fogarat&eacute;\\" no me emocionaba tanto con un CD de Juan Luis. En esta ocasi&oacute;n, creo que la misi&oacute;n de Juan Luis ha sido la de volver a las letras rom&aacute;nticas, a cantarle al amor, a sensibilizarnos con sus rimas sencillas e ingeniosas. Juan Luis logra inyectarnos el ritmo y la poes&iacute;a de una manera muy parecida a los tiempos en que \\"La Bilirrubina\\" era un himno de alegr&iacute;a (a&uacute;n lo es, sin dudas).<br /><br />\\"Medicine for my soul\\" abre las puertas. Es la versi&oacute;n en ingl&eacute;s de \\"La Llave de mi coraz&oacute;n\\", y a mi juicio, hace m&aacute;s l&oacute;gica escucharla en ingl&eacute;s que en espa&ntilde;ol. Los versos \\"cuadran\\" mejor al ubicarse en un gringo de Lousiana enamorado de una \\"latin girl\\" de San Pedro de Macor&iacute;s que un chico de Ciudad nueva. :) La nota beisbol&iacute;stica queda igual para ambas versiones, pues menciona a Sammy Sosa, quien se esfuerza por regresar a las Grandes Ligas. Supongo que el otrora \\"Bambino del Caribe\\" debe sentirse m&aacute;s motivado con este detalle. Pero volviendo al tema, es tremendamente pegajoso, y como siempre nos ha acostumbrado Juan Luis, un malabarismo de tonadas y arreglos. Empieza como un mambo que de inmediato nos recuerda a P&eacute;rez Prado, pero sin dejar de enriquecer la canci&oacute;n con la caracter&iacute;stica percusi&oacute;n salsera y los sonidos bachateros. Definitivamente, es tremendamente contagiosa.<br /><br />\\"La Traves&iacute;a\\" es un merengue con profunda percusi&oacute;n y moderadamente r&aacute;pido (nada parecido a la agitaci&oacute;n de \\"La Cosquillita\\" o \\"El Farolito\\"). La base l&iacute;rica es sencilla: No hay nadie como t&uacute; en todo el mundo. Y es un tema did&aacute;ctico, pues quien lo escuche deber&iacute;a sentirse motivado a investigar los lugares de los cuales habla en la canci&oacute;n. Debe ser excelente para bailarlo en cualquier fiesta.<br /><br />\\"Te contar&aacute;n\\" llega a ritmo de salsa, con un tumbao que no se me parece a nadie. Una salsa muy correcta, sin el dramatismo vocal de Marc Anthony, m&aacute;s bien cercana al ritmo pedag&oacute;gico de Gilberto Santa Rosa. Pero Juan Luis es su propio imitador, y busca sus propias fronteras. \\"Te contar&aacute;n\\" es tambi&eacute;n un canto al amor &uacute;nico, al amor insuperable. Te contar&aacute;n que no hay un coraz&oacute;n que te ame igual que yo, es su premisa y s&iacute; que lo logra.<br /><br />\\"Que me des tu cari&ntilde;o\\" es la primera bachata de este CD, y dir&iacute;a que la m&aacute;s hermosa desde que nos encandil&oacute; con sus letras de \\"Bachata Rosa\\". \\"Que me des tu cari&ntilde;o\\" es una excusa para cantar bajito al o&iacute;do y enamorar a la enamorada. Suave tonada y delicado arreglo de met&aacute;foras.<br /><br />\\"Como yo\\" resuena a ritmo de merengue y me recuerda bastante al \\"Niagara en Bicicleta\\", pero por supuesto sin el toque de protesta social sustituido por el canto al amor y la contemplaci&oacute;n de la dicha.<br /><br />\\"Si t&uacute; no bailas conmigo\\" es un compendio de met&aacute;foras que asombra, una tras otra va maravillando m&aacute;s que la anterior, y girando todo alrededor de una sencilla idea: la noche se conjura para bailar, pero si no bailas conmigo, prefiero no bailar. Es un merengue lento, casi ac&uacute;stico, ideal para abrir cualquier boda (y darle descanso a \\"T&uacute;\\") o para que tu novia te ense&ntilde;e a (por fin) dominar el baile de nuestra m&uacute;sica. Esta es, por mucho, mi canci&oacute;n preferida de todo el CD.<br /><br />\\"S&oacute;lo tengo ojos para ti\\" es una suave balada rom&aacute;ntica. Demasiado rom&aacute;ntica, si se puede pensar en que la belleza puede ser demasiado bella alguna vez. Juan Luis canta a la fidelidad, canta a la entrega, canta al compromiso que se renueva con cada verso que sale, con cada acorde que suena de su guitarra. Sencillamente, es una de las canciones m&aacute;s hermosas que he escuchado en mi vida.<br /><br />\\"Amores\\" es un merengue como en los viejos tiempos, con una base r&iacute;tmica muy diversa (a veces suena como los vallenatos de Carlos Vives, a veces le escuchas acordes de latin jazz). La letra es quiz&aacute;s la menos bonita de todo el CD, en el sentido de que no es tan asombrosa como cualquiera de las dem&aacute;s piezas.<br /><br />\\"Cancioncita de amor\\" nos trae una salsa dividida en dos secciones, empieza lenta y suavemente, y se acelera un poco en el &uacute;ltimo minuto record&aacute;ndome por un momento los coros de \\"A pedir su mano\\". Tiene una estructura muy f&aacute;cil de seguir y muy bailable.<br /><br />\\"Sabia manera\\" es un bolero abachateado que podr&iacute;a ser balada tambi&eacute;n. La &uacute;nica cr&iacute;tica que podr&iacute;a decir de este tema es que suena demasiado triste, cuando la letra es, nueva vez, un canto al amor. Siento que tiene acordes de despecho pero letras de esperanzada dulzura.<br /><br />\\"La llave de mi coraz&oacute;n\\" es la canci&oacute;n que da t&iacute;tulo al CD completo, y tiene el mismo arreglo que \\"Medicine for my soul\\", que es la versi&oacute;n en ingl&eacute;s. Como expres&eacute; antes, es un mambo muy ch&eacute;vere, pero personalmente me gusta m&aacute;s el arreglo en ingl&eacute;s que en espa&ntilde;ol.<br /><br />\\"Something good\\" es una sorpresa. No me esperaba encontrar una pieza tan hermosa, en ingl&eacute;s, y a d&uacute;o con Chiara Civella, a quien confieso no conocer. La canci&oacute;n es en bachata y el saxo le da un toque de jazz tremendamente ex&oacute;tico. Y el ritmo... &iexcl;es maravilloso! Es mi segunda favorita de todo el &aacute;lbum.<br /><br />\\"A la vera\\" es una balada que termina siendo merengue lento, y por las letras hay que ubicarse en tierra adentro. Es un tema que me recuerda el sentimiento de esperanza de \\"Ojal&aacute; que llueva caf&eacute;\\".<br /><br />En mi opini&oacute;n, este es el mejor CD de Juan Luis Guerra desde \\"Fogarat&eacute;\\". S&oacute;lo me encuentro mejor a \\"Bachata Rosa\\", \\"Ojal&aacute; que llueva caf&eacute;\\" y \\"Fogarat&eacute;\\". Pero sin dudas, este CD ganar&aacute; muchos premios, es un producto tremendamente bien hecho, que le da de nuevo un aire positivo a la carrera de este artista del mundo.<br /><br />Estoy feliz de haberlo adquirido. &iexcl;FELIZ!letra es quizás la menos bonita de todo el CD, en el sentido de que no es tan asombrosa como cualquiera de las demás piezas.    \\"Cancioncita de amor\\" nos trae una salsa dividida en dos secciones, empieza lenta y suavemente, y se acelera un poco en el último minuto recordándome por un momento los coros de \\"A pedir su mano\\".

0743487486|5.0|I opened the Wall Street Journal today to find an article entitled \\"The Most-Praised Generation Goes to Work.\\" The article describes how some employers have to \\"dish out kudos to workers for little more than showing up.\\" One company has a staff \\"celebrations assistant\\" whose job is to throw confetti at employees and pass out helium ballons; another estimates that employees receive praise every 20 seconds.  The examples go on and on.  Perhaps parents and educators need to look at \\"rewards and praise\\" in a new light.  This book does just that and I wish I would have read it sooner!  I cannot recommend this book enough.  Instead of giving you a \\"blow-by-blow\\" of what to do in a specific situation, Kohn gives you strategies that can apply and be expanded to numerous situations.  Many new parents and teachers want to know what to do if the child does \\"this.\\"  Well, as we all experience by dealing with various people in our lives, we need to treat each person as an individual and may deal with the situation differently depending on the people involved.  One important point Kohn makes that I found extremely insightful was to think (and listen) to how we speak to our (and others') children.  If we would not want to be spoken to like that then perhaps we need to reflect on how we can handle the situation differently.  Good luck to all new parents and educators who are willing to take a deep look at their choices and make the necessary changes to help our children!
B000O178BY|4.0|Well, the new NIN album is finally out! Wait a second.... it's only been 2 years. I guess it's a lot easier to write/produce an album when your sans heroin. Having enjoyed the previous installment (With Teeth. Ya that's right, I loved that disc for what it was) I was quick to snag this one off the shelf at the release date. I have to say, there are some killer tracks on this album. I must have listened to \\"God Given\\" about 20 times already. That song is so f*ckin slick it will loosen your bowels with it's hypnotic fluttering bass line. The same kind of bass line appears on \\"My Violent Heart\\" and \\"Zero-Sum\\" as well. This can make for some repetition but it sounds so cool it's acceptable. \\"The Good Soldier\\" is a slow rolling groove with some heavy guitar riffs interlaced. It demonstrates a direction for Trent first felt on With Teeth. \\"The Beginning of the End\\" is a catchy little tune that will likely follow up \\"Survivalism\\" as the second single (if it hasn't already, I don't watch MTV). Speaking of \\"Survivalism\\", I'm sure you all heard that hypnotic pulse driver already. Perfect song for speeding around town in my BMW. \\"The Greater Good\\" is a trippy number that is sure to evoke marijuana use. \\"Me, I'm Not\\" creates an eerie atmosphere that draws you in the second it starts. Most of the tracks on here are enjoyable, although some may take time to grow (Like \\"Vessel\\" with it's distorted shock beat that can be hard to stomach at first). One track I can't handle is \\"Capital G\\". It's far too late for a Bush basher to hold it's ground. The beat reminds me of Michael Jackson's \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" (not a good thing for NIN) and Trent's singing is really corny and I can't stand this. More so, this song sums up the lyrical issues I have with the album. I hate to say it as a diehard NIN fan but Trent dishes out some really lame lyrics at several points. The first few lines of \\"Capital G\\" sum up my last two points perfectly and are sure to make some fans cringe.  For the most part the duds appear on this song which can easily be skipped over. Other then that, the rest of the tracks range from \\"nod your head\\" good to \\"grab you by the balls\\" awesome.  I give this 4.5/5 due to \\"Capital G\\" and some other minor lyrical drawbacks. Production is top-notch as always. Direction is ever changing, which is what I love about Trent's music.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I LOVE this cd.  Her Voice is amazing and so moving.  She takes your mind off to a better place.
0743298020|1.0|. . . Leprosy of the spirit, that is.<br /><br />This review is for people who still care about what they put into their minds and hearts; all others may skip it.<br /><br />I was intrigued by this book's story line.  In my innocence, I didn't realize that such shocking horror awaited me in the pages of what looked to be a very promising story.  It started out so beautifully, but abruptly altered.<br /><br />The author has turned her talent and lovely writing style to filth and depravity.  I could not read beyond the first seventy or so pages.  I returned the book to Amazon.<br /><br />I do not understand why anyone would write such awful things.  I also do not understand why anyone would publish it or want to read it.
B00005JP1A|2.0|Katherine (Hilary Swank), a former missionary, now travels the world investigating `miracles'; she doesn't believe in them anymore and she is always able to find a scientific explanation for the occurrence. A professor at LSU, she is approached by Doug (David Morrissey, BBC America's \\"Viva Blackpool\\") the science teacher in a small town called Haven, up in the Louisiana Bayou. Katherine and her assistant, Ben (Idris Elba), a former student now professor, arrive to find an idyllic little town. But when they arrive at the river, the site of a murder, they find the water has turned to blood. A strange, young girl, Loren (AnnaSophia Robb, \\"The Bridge to Terrabithia\\") has murdered her older brother and now the town fears it will be visited by the ten biblical plagues. As Katherine, Ben and Doug continue to poke around, it appears the townsfolk might be right; frogs, locusts, fire in the sky, and more all happen with increasing frequency. Katherine is desperate to prove this can all be proved by science before the townsfolk murder Loren, believing she is a messenger of Satan.<br /><br />\\"The Reaping\\", directed by Stephen Hopkins (TV's \\"24\\", \\"The Ghost and the Darkness\\"), starts out in a promising fashion, but quickly deteriorates.<br /><br />Since the ten plagues feature so heavily in the story, let's examine the seven different sins this film commits.<br /><br />1. The sin of Greed.<br /><br />On the one hand, it seems odd that Swank would follow her second Oscar winning performance (\\"Million Dollar Baby\\") with \\"Freedom Writers\\" and \\" The Reaping\\".<br /><br />On the other hand, it doesn't seem odd at all.<br /><br />These are big budget films, so she was likely offered a large paycheck for both and can't be blamed for trying to earn some real money for her craft. She clearly didn't make a lot of money for \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and didn't receive a lot for \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". Why shouldn't she try to capitalize on her fame and make some money?<br /><br />One reason: because she isn't paying respect to her craft. Swank is a very good actress and has created some memorable characters in her films. Both Oscar winning performances were also very different, providing further testament to her artistic abilities.<br /><br />It is sad that so many fine actors and actresses find it necessary to make inferior films simply to keep their name in the public's eye and to help sustain their career. The worst films Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep have made are the films that were their most commercial and offered the biggest paychecks. These are great actors who should wait for great roles. Their fans would appreciate them all the more as well.<br /><br />2. The sin of Sloth.<br /><br />\\"The Reaping\\" has a couple of plot twists which really test credibility, even in a film about the ten plagues visiting a small Louisiana bayou town. The filmmakers were lazy and throw in one last plot twist at the very end, to simply make the film seem shocking and, hopefully, memorable. But this plot twist is just stupid and telegraphed to the audience way in advance. Then they throw in a final plot twist, which is also stupid and telegraphed in advance, so it doesn't provide the necessary shock either.<br /><br />At this point, they apparently have used up their imagination and skill. Rather than to create something interesting, they take the easy way out and try to shock us. It doesn't work.<br /><br />3. The sin of Envy.<br /><br />The film begins promisingly. We watch as Katherine and Ben investigate a `miracle' in a small South American village. It sets a nice eerie tone for the film, which seems as though it might continue once the story shifts to Louisiana. As each plague happens, Katherine is left scrambling to try to figure out why it happened, and can't. So her faith is tested once again.<br /><br />Then, towards the end of the film, director Hopkins seems to realize this is a bid budget film and he hasn't had the opportunity to use a lot of special effects.\\"Let's use them all\\" he seems to say. \\"Other directors get to spend a lot of money on these, why can't I?\\"  And the climax is a barrage of light and sound, all created within a computer and looking just as fake as you could imagine.<br /><br />It doesn't help that this sequence is so clearly filmed on a set, and not even a realistic one at that. We are talking about a set that would've been commonplace in the 50s. In fact, I think the set was also used in Tim Burton's \\"Ed Wood\\", about the schlock meister who made some of the worst films in history. So, we have a fake set overwhelmed by loud, obnoxious special effects. This doesn't help to make the sequence more believable and completely eradicates any feeling of mood or suspense that may have been created through out the beginning of the film.<br /><br />4. The sin of Gluttony.<br /><br />One of the plagues, flies, is visited upon the group as they have a barbecue dinner. All of a sudden, their food is covered with flies and maggots. Yuck. But it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the story. It almost seems as though this scene is included to knock off one of the plagues, to make sure they get through all ten.<br /><br />5. The sin of Lust.<br /><br />There are a couple of lame attempts to create a romantic triangle, between Katherine, Doug and Ben, but they don't work. Nothing is ever developed in the relationship between Katherine and Ben, except for a few furtive glances. So when Doug becomes a glimmer in Katherine's eye, any attempts to build jealousy on Ben's part fall flat.<br /><br />One of these tacked-on surprise endings also concerns lust, in a way. But it is so silly it merely serves to make us laugh.<br /><br />As I watched \\"The Reaping\\", I initially thought I had lucked onto a fairly good film. But as the film progressed, I realized I had made a mistake. \\"The Reaping\\" would follow the course set by many, many horror/ terror/ supernatural films. The film would ultimately fall apart. As this became more and more apparent, I began to lust for a more substantial film, something made with more skill and thought.<br /><br />6. The sin of Pride.<br /><br />Or lack thereof.<br /><br />Hilary Swank should take more care with her career. As discussed, she seems to be taking roles to earn a paycheck. If she isn't careful, she will make one too many bad decisions and then won't enjoy the wealth of opportunity she now has. She should take more pride in the fact that she has earned two Academy Awards, for very memorable performances and stop subjecting us to these roles, the type of films more suitable for actresses like Jessica Biel, Ali Larter and Kate Mara.<br /><br />All of this leads to the final sin...<br /><br />7. The sin of Wrath/ Anger.<br /><br />\\"The Reaping\\" ultimately deteriorates, throwing special effects at the screen, ruining any characterizations the actors may have been able to establish, and throwing many plot twists at us. This led me to become angry at the amount of time I wasted watching this film.se a lot of special effects. \\"Let's use them all\\" he seems to say. \\"Other directors get to spend a lot of money on these, why can't I?\\"  And the climax is a barrage of light and sound, all created within a computer and looking just as fake as you could imagine. <br /> <br />It doesn't help that this sequence is so clearly filmed on a set, and not even a realistic one at that.

B000FQ4M58|1.0|This is not up to the standard of a Bat Out Of Hell album. Nothing stands out here and it's just a total failure. The absence of Steinmen is revealed as soon as you play track 1, plus the whole album sounds very similar from song to song and boring for an album with an epic title like Bat Out Of Hell.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film is not to ordinary people! It is a film to the same people capable of understanding films like \\"Blade Runner\\", La Dolce Vita, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and others masterpieces.<br /><br />It is a film to people capable of discerning between something good and bad, people that read truly good books and listen to truly good music. \\"It is not to people that like films with Chuck Norris, Jennifer Lopez, and Madonna, and consider both Sylvester Stallone and Madonna respectively the best actor and actress ever\\".<br /><br />When I saw this film for the very first time I recognized immediately his value, it is a portrait of a complete alienation of the modern life where the next step is just stay acting all the time as if the life was a \\"B film\\" with a very poor script indeed, and the worst thing is that you look at your side and see that everybody has been acting the same \\"B film\\" with the same poor script.<br /><br />What happens in this case is that the character of Kevin Spacey discovers one day this reality and tries to recover the meaning of his life, but he knows that this means to get away from this style of living, just getting rid of the life he has been living for years and this is not an easy thing to do. Watching it is like to be put in front of a big mirror. Soon people around him start to react against his sudden liberty and their final achievement is to eliminate him as a kind of a vengeance, because his real liberty was too aggressive to their hypocrisy. In the end he is assassinated for the same reason those \\"two bikers were assassinated in the film Easy Rider\\", because he is \\"Too Free\\" and has been showing to the others their futile and useless way of living. Is a very courageous film. Bravo, The script is terrific, \\"and some scenes are pure poetry\\".<br /><br />It is sad to read reviews of people saying that don't like this film because of some sexual scenes, in a country that is the major producer of pornography in the whole world, whatis the prove that this film is right, we have to change this society immediately.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Since I first saw Tron in the theaters, I thought it provided an interesting and plausible take on what in recent years has come to be called \\"intelligent design\\" theory.  Arent't we are all just programs, but with DNA as our (evolving) code?   <br /> <br />As for the identity of the programmer, well, reasonable people can differ.  I kind of like the Jeff Bridges paradigm.  <br /> <br />Philosophical stuff aside, Tron is a good sci-fi flick and an entertaining ride.  I'd suggest it laid the foundation for The Matrix, some 17 years earlier.  Even though it's a Disney movie, it probably won't (unlike Bambi) horrify your kids.  I have watched it several times over the years and am sure I will do so again.  <br />
0345440927|4.0|this isn't as good as the baby whisperer, or maybe it's just not as insightful, but that's likely due to the fact that i don't need as much guidance now as the parent of a toddler as i did when i had a newborn and read the baby whisperer. i like that she has a quiz in the beginning of this book, as she did in \\"baby.\\" it really helped me get in touch with some issues & forced me to concentrate- which can sometimes be difficult when you have a frazzled day parenting a toddler. as i did in the baby whisperer book, i'll take the quiz again later and see how my child has changed and what i need help with then. ms. hogg is very nurturing and calming. i'm so sad to hear that she died. i was heartbroken, because i was really looking forward to her help in a few years when my toddler becomes a teenager!
1581806574|5.0|I have never drawn a dragon before. I am a scientific illustrator and there is not much room for creativity in my daily work. This book is so great that after some trials I can't wait to draw another dragon and try a different face and a different body shape and so on....  <br />The step-by-step demos are very clear making the construction of those beautiful creatures much more fun than hard work! I wish the book had more 1000 pages!!!
B000003CUJ|2.0|Being a Wagnerite is sometimes a little difficult.  Wagner's music is demanding on practically all levels, and especially demanding to the casual listener.  The music can sometimes be too sugary, way overblown, or deceptively muted.  This can definitely present problems, and that is why there are those who can detest Wagner's works to the degree that others love it.  There is little middle room: Love or hate, Wagner's music is unique...and difficult. <br /> <br />This CD brings out another difficulty: The attempt to tone down Wagner and make his work more generally acceptable.  On the good side, this CD is a rather good compilation of some of the Ring's most important melodies.  Its symphonic structure allows good flow between the rather disjoint work, and the idea works to a significant degree. <br /> <br />But Maazel's approach is to create a uniformity of interpretation on a work that took more than 20 years to complete.  This uniformity saps the Ring of much of its musical strength.  The standard pieces are played almost the same as the other selections; little differentiation is evident and as a result only minor aspects of the drama in this incredible music drama are revealed. <br /> <br />While it is possible to play Wagner's music poorly, I always thought it was equally possible to at least grasp its passion.  Unfortunately, Maazel's approach proves me to be wrong. <br /> <br />Yes, being a Wagnerite can be very difficult.
1881273156|4.0|good book if you're having trouble communicating. if your problems are something more concrete such \\"i want my partner to stop smoking & he doesn't understand why\\" it won't help much.
B000000I0Q|4.0|Steve Hackett was a bit deceived by \\"The Lamb lies down on Broadway\\" <br />He wanted to prove that you can produce an excellent album without putting too much keyboards and vocals, well, he succeded. <br />Very good cd, I listen to it not very often, but each time I do, it is a pleasure.
B000F4MLZ8|4.0|I am perhaps a sucker for the melancholy, but this albumn is splendid.  I really do LOVE a number of songs on here and find the others very good.  It is straightforth and down to earth, with simply good songwriting, good playing and great vocals. The duets mesh in a beautiful way that makes me want to sing along, and I do when I am alone.  I am ranking it up there with Damien Rice and Sufjan Stevens.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|Peculiar, original, strange and bending towards the darker areas of the comedy genre, this art house film turned popular hit, is full of pleasant surprises with equally sad moments made hilarious.<br /><br />There are two aspects about this film that has made it a great film, and that is its talented cast and off beat soundtrack due to the combined contributions of Mychael Danna and DeVotchka. The music adds to the film's originality and certainly is the right \\"tone\\" to the many pitfalls and basic bad luck that this dysfunctional family experience while on the road to California to have the youngest, Olive Hoover, compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br /><br />What is extraordinary is that all the characters are so different in personality and sensibility, the strongest being the cocaine snorting grandpa, (Alan Arkin) and the most unusual, Dwayne, (Paul Dano) a disciplined boy who reads Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, has taken a vow of silence, (more to escape from having to engage with his strange family) and goal to be jet pilot. At the end of the film we see that he is not as strange as we first thought. Of course, Toni Collette as the mother manages to somehow keep her family together despite their ecentricities and the many mishaps that befall them: a wonderful and restrained performance.<br /><br />Although excellent performances by the entire cast, Olive, (Abigail Breslin) stole the show as Little Miss Sunshine, realistic and endearing, the end of the film, her dance number truly stole the show.<br /><br />Having heard so much positive talk about Little Miss Sunshine to finally see it, all expectations were met as it is original and very funny.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
1400049628|4.0|The world is swarming with the undead. Your possessions, your account balances mean nothing. The only thing of value is your survival. What do you do? You open your copy of \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" that's what. The Zombie Survival Guide is a very entertaining how to guide of battling and eluding the undead. It goes into detail of the safest places to hide out, find help, and take down the flesh eating bastards. It helps you pick the best weapons, understand zombie behavior and strategy. One of the coolest parts of the book is the \\"eye witness\\" account chapter which has urban legends of sopposed real encounters of zombies, the most famous being the legend of the St.Croy Zombie. If you like zombie flicks or horror flims this book is for you. I found myself reading it over and over just because it's so fun. Have fun but most importantly. PREPAIR YOURSELF!
B000O178BY|5.0|This album is great begining to end. Each song is nice and flows perfectly. I really enjoyed it. Its an album where you should listen to it shraight through.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|\\"I don't want to hear their voices as long as they vote with their wallets.\\"<br /><br />\\"Be\\" was a loaded album. It was musically diverse, containing styles as varied as heavy metal, progressive, classical, and gospel. Accompanying the music were some of the most intelligent, socially charged lyrics I've ever seen in an album. \\"Be\\" touched on everything- the effects of unrestricted capitalism, civilization vs. savagery, god and where god's place is in the world today, technological progress as man's greatest accomplishment and man's failure, the ecosystem, ethics, love, and loss. All these topics played a role in the album's sci-fi story of an apocalyptic earth in the near future.<br /><br />A few years have passed, and the follow up album \\"Scarsick\\" is out. \\"Be\\" was a tough album to live up to, and Pain of Salvation have done the right thing by not trying to match is musically. There is no string ensemble to be found on \\"Scarsick\\". In fact, the music is completely different then anything they've done before.<br /><br />The first two songs are heavy, rap based, and sound somewhat like the song \\"Used\\" on \\"the Perfect Element\\" album. I'm a little uncomfortable with that comparison, because I think both these songs are much stronger than that song, but in terms of style they are about the same. Gildenlow raps through the verses- mainly lyrics directed as an insult toward \\"MTV\\" culture in the United States.<br /><br />The next three songs are very satirical, poppy sounding, and very different than anything the band has done before. One song, \\"Crib Caged\\", seems to suggest its name comes from \\"MTV Cribs\\". The song is slow with a very positive message, but the middle section is very angry, as Gildenlow insults various symbols in popular culture much in the same way that Maynard James Keenan did in Tool's Aenima, i.e. f this, f that, f this, f that, f this, f that. Honestly, I think Crib Caged might drop more F-Bombs then Aenima.<br /><br />The next two songs are both very odd sounding. \\"America\\" is a satire on, you guessed it, America, in which the band plays some peppy music while Gildenlow sings about how the United States is doomed to join it's place besides the British, Roman, and Soviet empires soon. The song after \\"America\\" has something to do about Disco, and the subsequent song takes the album to a more mellow level, where it remains until the end.<br /><br /> Musically, the album is a success. Lyrically, some might be offended, because \\"Scarsick\\" does the one thing that \\"Be\\" did not do. Whereas \\"Be\\" showed us the consequences of problems that occur in the world today, \\"Scarsick\\" zooms in on real places in the real world, and shows how they are part of the problem that will lead to dire consequences.<br /><br />As an American, I know we live in a deeply flawed nation. Often times I wonder what the likes of Jefferson would think of the United States we live in today. Sometimes I wonder if the soldiers who shed their blood for us to have freedoms would appreciate the way we take those freedoms for granted today, how we let democracy take the back seat for our own personal laziness. It's true we live in a very apathetic nation, and I think Mr. Gildenlow would agree that that threatens us more than any terrorist organization overseas. When our nation was founded, the people governing did so for the sake of their ideals and beliefs. Now, what motivates people more than anything is the bottom line. Money is important, but what Gildenlow is saying is that in our society it seems like the bottom line has become the only line, and no one pays attention to anything else. It's true to a certain extent, but I won't dwell on this any longer lest my review of the album become something totally different.<br /><br />Most American listeners, like myself, will find plenty offensive in the album. Pain of Salvation look in at our nation from the outsiders point of view and unabashedly criticize. But I will say that they do a MUCH MUCH MUCH better job than most in the media who criticize from within (Micheal Moore, System of a Down, A Perfect Circle, Revolutionary Communist anything). Hopefully, those of us in the states motivated enough to call ourselves listeners of Pain of Salvation will see this album as \\"tough love\\". We are the only world power. We are the future. Unless we start thinking about the implications of our actions we will not have much of a future. It is time for myself and the new generation to get involved, end the wars of our fathers, and make the bed.<br /><br /> Let us not allow ourselves to hit the floor.MUCH MUCH MUCH better job than most in the media who criticize from within (Micheal Moore, System of a Down, A Perfect Circle, Revolutionary Communist anything).

B000OONTFU|3.0|As an early adopter of media platforms for years. I feel as a customer you get the highest value at the dawn of a new format. This along with Warner's own, 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and Universal's 'The Deer Hunter' are examples. I along with most, do not care for the second two films, but if i look at it like some long animatrix episodes them i guess 'The Matrix' sure costs alot! Look if you got the hardware to run these double-sided discs!!! (sick) run it! Were talkin 30GB on each side, 60 gigabyte discs! (take that bluray lol) x 5, this should be called 300! [Note to Buyers] *Buyers Beware* Animarix is in SD if anyone cares to begin a petition, i am at arms...
B000784WMW|5.0|I watched this because I had seen all the other versions of \\"Jane Eyre\\" and thought I should watch this one too. I wasn't expecting much. Was I surprised!  It is the most faithful to the book and beautifully acted.  Timothy Dalton is spectacular.  Yes, he is far too good looking to play Mr. Rochester, but he really gives his heart and soul to this performance and gives the definitive portrayal of Rochester.  Zelah Clarke is also very good and plays Jane as written in the novel.  I will watch this over and over.
B00004U0OQ|4.0|White Zombie was such an interesting band...they seemed like an anomaly among the mediocrity that abounded for so long in the mid to late 90s.  I loved la sexorcisto and this album was a solid follow-up.  The most intriguing thing about this band is the vast array of influences that combine to make their sound. <br /> <br />Astro Creep is more industrial and driving than la sexorcisto.  If you like groove metal pick up that record...because at times when I listen to this record it almost seems like you can hear the metronome pounding in the background.  The production and guitar sound on this is a vast improvement over la sexorcisto, but that record still eclipses astro creep. <br /> <br />The virtual absence of guitar solos was the main sticking point...Their guitar player, J yuenger, had some of the most frantic, meandoring solo work on la sexorcisto--but that is what made it interesting.  His playing on Astro Creep is almost minimalistic at times. <br /> <br />Blood, milk & sky is the opus on this album--that song has an amazing arrangement and probably best sums up their array of musical influences.  That would be the track that everyone should hear off this album...not more human than human, which is good, but suffered from overplay.
B00007ELJX|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I watched it two nights in the row. After the first viewing I knew I'd missed a lot - but also knew I wanted to see it again. \\"Whatever I understood was beautiful, whatever I did not understand was probably even more beautiful\\" and I wanted to find it. What helped me to figure it out (or at least I think I did) were two films I kept thinking about when watching LH both times: Bunuel's \\"That Obscure Object of Desire\\" and Lynch's Mulholland Drive. In Bunuel's film the main character's object of desire is played by two very different actresses. In LH the man who desires is played by two actors (Bill Pullman as Fred, the musician - in the amazing performance and Balthazar Getty as Pete, the mechanic). The object of their desire is Patricia Arquette, gorgeous Renee the Brunette, Fred's wife and seductive Alice the Blonde, the fire of Pete's loins. Is this the same woman? Are they twins? Is she a dream? That's for us, viewers to figure out. And we are on our own - Lynch knows but he would not help. I also think that in LH Lynch tells the same story (if he ever tells the stories) or paints the same painting like in MD: the story of gut-wrenching love, desire, obsession and jealousy. You can destroy the object of your desire but you will never be able to kill the love and longing for it. It will come back to you in your dreams; it will haunt you as long as you are able to feel. It will live in your soul and your head and torture you as long as you are alive. And you will never be able to have it.<br /><br />I think Lost Highway is Lynch's masterpiece, absolutely perfect film on all levels. It goes on the top of my list a little ahead of MD because the original idea belongs here. One thing I don't understand: why MD which is secondary to LH is so universally praised and well known while LH is considered lesser movie or even the failure. For me, LH is a masterpiece, a perfect film where everything works: visuals, sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever. I never thought I'd say this: I liked Marylyn Manson's version of I Put a Spell on You), acting - Patricia Arquette -there is some child like innocence in her that makes all men in the film completely mad about her.<br /><br />How does Lynch do it? What is his magic touch? How does he make his actors do what they do? Who dictates to him how to arrange perfectly every single frame so nothing is missing and everything is on its place? In the film so claustrophobic, there is a breathtaking aerial shot of the highway with two cars racing - it is beauty itself.<br /><br />That's what he had to say about his enigmatic underrated gem:<br /><br />\\"There's a human condition there - people in trouble, people led into situations that become increasingly dangerous. And it's also about mood and those kind of things that can only happen at night. You can just take that and run with it your own way.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is a key in the film as to its meaning. But keys are weird. There are surface keys, and there are deeper keys. Intellectual thinking leaves you high and dry sometimes. Intuitive thinking where you get a marriage of feelings and intellect lets you feel the answers where you may not be able to articulate them. Those kinds of things are used in life a lot, but we don't use them too much in cinema. There are films that stay more on the surface, and there's no problem interpreting their meaning.\\"<br /><br />\\"Death Valley is so beautiful. It just goes on forever. I like the idea of shooting in Death Valley - just the name. It made perfect sense for Lost Highway.\\"<br /><br />On the lighter note - You actually can learn something very important and useful from Lost Highway - please be polite to the other drivers on the road - you never know who the guy you just fingered turned out to be. :)sound (one of the most amazing soundtracks ever.

B00004VY01|5.0|In 1838 young Swiss governess Elisabeth Laurier enters into a private arrangement with an unnamed British gentleman, brokered by the matronly Mrs. Jago, possibly a midwife. She will bear him a child in return for a large sum of money. Unable to have children with his incapacitated wife, he (Charles) chooses the surrogate mother with the care of one practiced in animal husbandry. Miss Laurier is an intelligent, healthy young woman whose father is in debt, perhaps in debtor's prison. She chooses to raise the sum to free her father by bearing a child rather than to \\"sell myself for life\\" in a marriage of convenience to a rich man. Subtle and beautiful, this carefully choreographed film doesn't waste words or gestures. Seven years have passed when the story resumes, and Elizabeth has finally traced her child to this estate and been hired as the latest  governess. After minor setbacks, she quickly insinuates herself into a parental role with the misbehaving Louisa, despite Charles' unsuccessful attempt to see her off the property. Lord Clare, Charles' father, lives high in London, borrowing money against the estate and counseling Charles that living ones' life for pleasure is the only thing that matters. He polkas the property into the hands of the moneylenders (think \\"Scrooge and Marley\\" here!)  Frank and drastic choices must be made by all.<br /><br />It was unfortunate that the lion's share of published reviews were written by critics who clearly didn't understand the literary back story of British culture at the time this film is set. The trick to \\"getting it\\" is to be a reader of 19th century British novels. I recommend Bronte, Austen, Hardy, Dickens, and a smattering of the books by twentieth century British historian and Regency romance writer Georgette Heyer. This film isn't a bodice ripper, nor is it a knock-off of Jane Eyre; the presence of a comatose wife is not sufficient to hold up the comparison, unless Jane Eyre is allowed to meld with The French Lieutenant's Woman. The screenplay is, instead, reminiscent of a story that could come from the pen of Thomas Hardy. Much remains unsaid in this film, but falls in the realm of \\"understood\\" by those familiar with the literature of the period. An unmarried pregnant gentlewoman cannot work as a governess and must keep her pregnancy secret, possibly in the country or confined indoors, out of the public eye. She would have been supported by the father, possibly in the company of Mrs. Jago, the midwife, for the year of  pregnancy and recovery. Finding a chink to learn the identity of the father would not be impossible, and the story flows in a logical manner. I disagree with another viewer who doesn't like the child actor in the role of the daughter Louisa. She acts the role of a willful, spoiled child so well that I think the reviewer missed the fact that she was acting also. You're supposed to dislike this child in the beginning.<br /><br />The staging of this film is as remarkable as the story. Prior to this film, I didn't know who Stephen Dillane was. Since viewing this one, I have discovered other of his performances, and am amazed at his natural movement from one character to another. I hear he is fabulous on stage. Unlike many actors who play themselves in every film, Dillane makes every performance original and entirely natural. Likewise with Marceau; her manner, speech, and gestures are unique to each film she makes. The supporting cast were exemplary, and the attention to set details must be credited, I think, to the screenwriter and director, William Nicholson. One would think that his ability to create such a movie would propel him into more directorial endeavors, but though he loved the resulting film, it failed at the box office, and he hasn't pursued any more directing. Too bad!<br /><br />There are times in the film when British and French accents are slightly difficult to understand by this American ear. I found that viewing this film the first time with subtitles cleared up the problem. The only version of this film available to purchase today that will work in region 1 DVD players is a Hong Kong NTSC release that is formatted to TV. A recent wide-screen European Region 2 release is a hopeful sign of renewed interest--perhaps it will cross the pond and be available here again in its full theatrical format. Decryption software is available for download and purchase in order to watch this film on a computer's DVD player, masking the region code. It is an extra measure of work in order to view this film, but wide screen is definitely best. This sleeper deserves to be rescued and re-released.
B00005JNJV|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" (2005) directed by Christopher Nolan, takes us to the origins of Bruce Almighty aka Dark Night aka Batman. I have to admit that I have not seen any Batman's movies; so it made sense to explore the beginning of the legend, to find out how the billionaire Bruce Wayne ended up as a masked crusader who fought restlessly against the sinister forces that prey on the innocent and threaten to destroy Gotham City.<br /><br />Never been able to forget the murder of his parents before his eyes for which he felt guilty and responsible, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)  traveled the world fighting injustice with small-time criminals until one day mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) finds him and offers him the training with a mysterious and powerful League of Shadows, the organization presided over by Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). The League of Shadows is dedicated to restoring \\"balance\\" to a world in which \\"criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding.\\" Part of Ra's Al Ghul and Ducard plan was the total destruction of Gotham City. Bruce refuses to participate in it and returns to Gotham City where under the mask of Batman, he fights the corrupted city officials, the powerful mafia boss (Tom Wilkinson in yet another memorable performance), and the villainous Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, the show stealing performance from a young actor).<br /><br />By the end of the movie, we will know why Bruce chose Batman as his alter ago, we will see the original bat-mobile and will meet his friends and allies for the first time that include his trusted butler who has been always more than butler but a family member, Alfred (Michael Cane), the head of the science department in his corporation, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman plays a combination of God and Q) who can or have already invented anything, and honest police officer, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman is very believable in his rare good-guy role. He also has the best quote in the movie. When watching bat mobile in action, he exclaims, \\"I've got to get me one of these!\\"<br /><br />Directed by a very talented master of dark and atmospheric films with deep and interesting characters, Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" is gripping and emotional adventure which is equally interesting for the viewers of all ages and backgrounds.g bat mobile in action, he exclaims, \\"I've got to get me one of these!\\"  <br /> <br />Directed by a very talented master of dark and atmospheric films with deep and interesting characters, Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" is gripping and emotional adventure which is equally interesting for the viewers of all ages and backgrounds. <br />
0345479092|4.0|There is no *one* book out there that will give you all the answers you need on your specific baby situation, but in my baby care library, this is the resource I turn to the most.<br /><br />All of Hogg's suggestions are practical and compassionate, but what I like most about her book is her approach to sleep.  Babies are not left to cry it out, nor are they picked up and rocked when they cry at bedtime.<br /><br />First, it's all about the \\"window,\\" that brief period of time when baby is drowsy enough to fall asleep, but not over-tired and fussy.  It will take time to get good at noticing the window approaching, but you'll get there.  Second, it's about minimizing the distractions and potential wake-up alerts in the baby's sleeping environment.  Lastly, it's about coming in to baby when she cries, but instead of picking her up, being as comforting as possible with as little effort as possible.  Hogg frowns on \\"over-parenting.\\"  If baby is soothed with your hand on her chest, why pick her up and rock her?  The minimalist approach offers less opportunity for baby to develop undesirable sleep associations.  The idea is to let baby learn how to fall asleep on her own, but to let her know that if she has night-time needs, they will be met.<br /><br />My 5 month old daughter falls alseep on her own now, as long as I respect her \\"window\\" and if I miss it, I can get her to sleep in her crib after about 5 to 10 minutes of swaddling and holding her, but putting her down when her eyes are almost closed.  At first she would wake up during the transition from my arms to the crib, but after about a week, she got used to going to bed this way.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  This book can't take sole credit for all of my daughter's good behavior, but it is responsible for a large portion of it.  :)  Good luck to you, parents!  We have the most important job in the world, and remember, you are always doing better than you think you are.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly, starring Hercules' Kevin Sorbo as Captain Dylan Hunt and a supporting cast of talented actors, was one of the best science fiction shows on television in the past decade.  Maybe one of the best of all time!  Firefly is Captain Hunt's space ship - but, trust me, this is no ordinary space ship!  This ship's got personality, and I mean that in the literal sense.  Firefly is a sentient ship, played by Alexa Doig, who cares for her crew and her duty like a doting mother.  The crew of Firefly is absolutely delightful, from the mysterious preacher, Reverend Bem, to the ship's happy-go-lucky mechanic, Seamus Harper.  Firefly's storyline keeps viewers on the edge of their seat as it takes us through the story of restoring the intergalactic Commonwealth despite numerous challenges and obstacles.  Inspired both by Western cowboy-style themes and mythological undertones, Firefly is anything but typical - and is sure to delight even the most passionate sci-fi fan.
B000002UAC|5.0|This album is a big step up from PLEASE PLEASE ME  for a number reasons.  Firstly the cover is very memorable, nothing cheesy or light hearted about it and it is an artistic triumph.  Also is this the first album by any artist not to yield a single? Very revolutionary and it shows the abundance of ideas they were creating at this time.  It also grabbed the attention of The Times newspaper with its classical music critic, William Mann reviewing the album and The Beatles as if they were classical composers. (See below).    As for the songs, there are six covers and eight originals, icluding one Harrison composition.  George also sings on a few other numbers.  His first recorded composition, DON'T BOTHER ME is not a bad song by any means and is a praiseworthy first effort. His covers however, are not so sucsessful: ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN and DEVIL IN HER HEART show the limitations of his voice and he does not have the rock and roll voice that John and Paul posess.    All the Lennon-McCartney compositionsare of a high quality.  ALL MY LOVING, LITTLE CHILD, NOT A SECOND TIME, I WANNA BE YOUR MAN (sung by Ringo), IT WON\\"T BE LONG and ALL I GOTTA DO are teriffic.  The only so-so song is HOLD ME TIGHT. It is catchy but not very well sung by Paul.    They take other artists songs and put their unique interpretation on them.  PLEASE MR.POSTMAN, MONEY (both sung by John), YOU REALLY GOT A HOLD ON ME(John and George), TILL THERE WAS YOU (Paul) are all great renditions and the only two that are sub-par are the two covers sung by George mentioned above.    With this album The Beatles were really establishing themselves as a very differnt pop group from all other British acts.  It is worth buying for the amazing songs,but the truth is out. I bought the album for NOT A SECOND TIME, after reading Mr. Mann's review: \\"...so firmly are the major tonic sevenths and ninths built into thier tunes, and the flat submediant key switches, so natural is the Aeolian Cadence at the end of NOT A SECOND TIME (the chord progression which ends Gustav Mahler's SONG OF THE EARTH).\\"  Oh Yes, that is what The Beatles had in mind!!!!

B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head blew out of the gates in 1994 with their debut album, \\"Burn My Eyes\\", widely considered one of the best metal albums of the '90s. After several albums in which MH experimented with their style (with mixed results), many wondered if they could ever achieve the heights reached earlier in their career. As \\"The Blackening\\" proves, they can even surpass it.<br /><br />Perhaps the fans have been unfair to Machine Head....I thought that their follow-up to their initial album \\"The More Things Change...\\" was a very solid metal platter, and other subsequent releases, such as \\"Burning Red\\" and \\"Supercharger\\" were still decent, just flirting with other styles such as rap-metal and industrial, which didn't really gel with the bands' super-heavy, aggresssive neo-thrash metal. What makes \\"The Blackening\\" so special is the fact that the band have finally settled into playing what they want to play, and have begun pushing themselves musically into almost progressive metal directions- lengthy, complex and epic compositions, intense instrumental interludes and interplay between instruments and band members, and crazy, out-of-control shred soloing. They absolutely blow their previous work out of the water with this disc, and it is quite an exhilirating ride, at times.<br /><br />Lyrically, conceptually, and musically, this is miles above anything they have ever done. One listen to \\"The Aesthetics Of Hate\\" was enough for me...classic metal nihilism and agression, super heavy riffing, and a huge, intense crescendo of almost neo-classical-style guitar harmony combined with a modern \\"metalcore\\" sensibility building to a huge climax. Very, very cool. This is MH at their best, proving that they can hold their own against any other metal band out there. Awesome. Highest recommendation. I've been a fans since the beginning, and this is the Machine Head album I've always wanted.

0609610570|4.0|Execution is interesting in the context of numerous case studies that the authors have covered, but lacks a real, predictive model. There is some solid advice in the book, and a few lessons to be learned from the discussed examples, but many of the recommendations are either tautological, or simply motherhood and pie. At times, the authors contradict their own recommendations in the case studies and propose circular definitions that lead nowhere fast. This is not to say that this is a poor book, it's well written and offers some great insights - I just wouldn't place it at the top of my reading list.
B000O178BY|5.0|It's hard when an established artist releases a new album, as many of the reviews are compared to their previous albums.  I will avoid talking about this album in relation to the Fragile and With Teeth, and soley judge this album by itself.  This album, is a dark journey through of music, with a smart and layered sonic sound.  The nuances of this album are so subtle as to require mutliple listens to get them all.  This is not an album with the intent of a tons of hit singles, but one built on making one cohesive album (though I forsee a few hit singles).  The album really should be heard as a whole to get the whole picture.  The nihilistic landscape is painted by the grim voice of Trent Rezonr, acting as both star and storyteller.  The album is amazing.  I highly recomend a listen.
B00005JPCF|2.0|You'd think that a movie with adorable singing and dancing penguins would leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.  But \\"Happy Feet\\" left me cold.  It's not so much the political message I minded (admirable as it is), or the hamfisted way it's shoved down the viewer's throat in the last five minutes of the film; it's more the lapses in logical storytelling.  Any zoo with a tap-dancing penguin wouldn't let it out of its sight, let alone allow it to return to Antarctica.  And for a movie about finding one's \\"heartsong,\\" there's not one scrap of original music.  (Unless you count Prince's \\"Song of the Heart\\" that plays over the final credits.)  What a wasted opportunity to create an original score; who needs to hear Nicole Kidman and Brittany Murphy singing lousy 80s pop songs?  On the plus side, George Miller certainly knows what to do with his camera, and there are some wonderful visual effects and compositions, but it's not enough to make up for a lackluster story and script.  (By the way, parents whose kids have been weaned on \\"Finding Nemo\\" may find themselves having a lot of uncomfortable explaining to do about all those gobbled-up fish.) \\"Happy Feet\\" won the Oscar by riding on Al Gore's political (and commendable) coattails, not because it's in any way a classic.
0618680004|1.0|This book is full of misquotes and false facts.  First off, In chapter 1 of his book \\"The God Delusion', Dawkins explains how \\"religious conflicts\\" are mislabeled under group or ethnic strife. Dawkins seems to have forgotten his studies in psychology of human group dynamics. Groups of humans in power will oppress other groups, just based upon membership within each group. The membership could involve religion, language, or just geography. In fact, the demarcation could be as simple as labeling each group. Psychological studies of group behavior have shown that groups of people will become adversaries with others outside of their own group. Just watch your son's next soccer game. However, Richard Dawkins has only one daughter, so maybe he was never involved in sports. Even so, Philip Zimbardo's famous Stanford prison experiment showed that students assigned to the category of \\"guards\\" physically abused their fellow students just because they were labeled as \\"prisoners.\\"  In fact, the study went so much out-of-control that it had to be ended early.  Also, conveniently left out of his discussion is the fact that atheists (who are not religious) have killed far more people than all \\"religious\\" conflicts combined. Joseph Stalin killed 20 million Soviet citizens between 1929 and 1939. Mao Tse-tung killed 34 to 62 million Chinese during the Chinese civil war of the 1930s and 1940s.  Pol Pot, the leader of the Marxist regime in Cambodia, Kampuchea, in the 1970's killed 1.7 million of his own people. In fact, the Pol Pot regime specifically preached atheism and sought to exterminate all religious expression in Cambodia. And, since atheist-led states were largely unheard of before the 20th century, atheists have just begun to get in on the killing rampage.<br /><br />Dawkins complains about religions spreading through conquest and cites Christianity's spread by Roman conquest, followed by the Crusaders, conquistadors and other European invaders. What Dawkins doesn't mention is that Christianity originally spread from a small group in Judea to \\"conquer\\" the civilized world without firing a shot, hundred of years before Emperor Constantine declared it the official religion of Rome. It is apparent that Dawkins doesn't want to admit that Christianity originally spread by the application of reason and logic. In fact, Christianity spread throughout the Middle East, Asia, and Europe at a time when it was severely persecuted by the Roman Empire, which controlled the entire area.<br /><br />He then defines the god against which he is arguing:  \\"He not only created the universe; he is a personal God dwelling within it, or perhaps outside it (whatever that might mean), possessing the unpleasantly human qualities to which I have alluded.\\"  The disturbing thing about Dawkins' definition of God is that he doesn't seem to understand the nature of the universe. Dawkins doesn't seem to understand that space-time is in a state of continual expansion, and that the universe is neither infinite nor eternal. The cause of this expansion, whether it be natural or supernatural, exists outside the bounds of detectable space-time. So, yes, there is an \\"outside\\" the universe. The God of Judaism and Christianity does not just \\"perhaps\\" exist outside the universe, but quite explicitly cannot be contained by even the outer reaches of the universe.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins' second chapter is a rambling 43-page rant against theism. Instead of writing a real introduction about \\"the God hypothesis,\\" Dawkins immediately launches into a long list of the supposed faults of Yahweh, including, \\"jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.\\" And all that is just part of the first sentence! Of course, there are no attempts to substantiate any of the claims by giving examples. In fact, atheists love to point out examples where God judges those who do evil (as if we humans would never stoop so low to do such things by making laws, having police, judges and jails). How dare God judge evil! Dawkins won't tell you that the reason why God told the Israelites to wipe out entire populations was because they were burning their own children as sacrifices. Maybe Dawkins would have preferred that we still have those people around so that he could offer his own daughter as a burnt offering.<br /><br />Also, Richard Dawkins makes numerous assertions, nearly all of which he fails to support with either logic or data. Examples include the numerous names he gives to God, the claim that Paul founded Christianity, the claim that Christianity is the bloodiest religion ever, the claim that there are few strong atheists, and the claim that the founding fathers would be rolling over in their graves because religious people hold political office in the United States - all of which are shown to be false. As in chapter 1, Dawkins is caught quoting out-of-context, when the original intent of the author was exactly opposite of what he reported. I'm not sure how he thought he would get away with this kind of despicable lying. Dawkins' most egregious example of failing to supports his claims is the assertion that intelligences (including God) must be evolved. Dawkins doesn't seem to apply his claim to the universe itself, which displays considerable evidence that it is anything but average. In fact, an average universe would consist solely of thermal energy, and no matter at all. It is clear that Richard Dawkins dislikes the God of Christianity primarily because of His desire for moral accountability from people. Dawkins doesn't want to be morally accountable, and finds a God who demands such accountability to be evil, instead preferring the non-intervening god of deism. I agree with Dawkins that the NOMA concept is wrong - that the question of God's existence can be addressed by the sciences. Obviously, we view the probability of God's existence quite differently.<br /><br />Dawkins misquotes several founding fathers, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin, who made statement against the religion of their time. John Adams is quoted as saying, \\"This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.\\" However here is the complete quote in an April 19, 1817, letter to Thomas Jefferson:<br /><br />\\"Twenty times in the course of my late reading have I been on the point of breaking out, 'This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion at all!!!' But in this exclamation I would have been as fanatical as Bryant or Cleverly. Without religion, this world would be something not fit to be mentioned in polite company, I mean hell.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins finishes chapter 2 with a discussion of the possibility of extraterrestrial life. He maintains that we must remain agnostic on this issue, since there are many points of ignorance regarding values that can be assigned to the Drake equation. Although it is true that many of the values cannot be determined with much certainty, the results are coming in - and they don't support Dawkins assertion that the \\"principle of mediocrity\\" applies to our solar system/planet. Dawkins briefly mentions the anthropic principle, but dismisses it by saying, \\"if our solar system really were the only one in the universe, this is precisely where we, as beings who think about such matters, would have to be living.\\" Dawkins doesn't seem to understand that declaring our existence on this planet as the reason why our planet is special is a logical fallacy (converse accident).  Dawkins even accepts the possibility that our existence is just part of a computer simulation and says that \\"I cannot think how to disprove it.\\"<br /><br />Theres so much more I could write, but I believe Ive made my point.

B00005JPM0|5.0|Paul VerHoven has reflected on the Dutch resistance during World War II. In Soldier of Orange which was a powerful movie glamorizing the Dutch resistance with a protagonist who was more of an adventurer than a patriot, we are provided with a Jewish heroine who is a plucky survivor who does whatever is necessary to stay alive while helping the Resistance. VerHoven shows that the Resistance had in its midst persons who were closer to the German point of view on Jews than we had been led to believe in Soldier of Orange. There was good and bad in the resistance including rampant anti-semitism. Other than the heroine beautifully played by Caric van Houten, the most emphatic person is the German commander of the SS, who has an affair with Van Houten, and it is their plan to leave Holland at the end of the war together. At the end, you do not believe that many of the  Dutch were any better than the Germans. This is a movie that must be seen. After watching it, I watched Soldier of Orange (on my top list) and appreciated why this movie was made. VerHoven wanted to correct the image of the Dutch that he had created in Soldier of Orange. It is filled with action more than any other recent movie but has a powerful message to give to the viewer. Paul VerHoven had to return to Holland to make this thriller to cleanse his soul.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Most people, at least in the Western World, are aware of Triumph of the Will through the notoriety of its connection to the rise of Naziism. But I would bet that most of those same people have never seen it. If you are in that number, then here is your chance to be entranced by this mesmerizing exercise in what today is called \\"spin\\".<br /><br />Many things have been said and written about this film and almost anyone who praises it for its quality as art is almost immediately attacked as some sort of closet Nazi. Witness the recent imbroglio involving British pop singer Bryan Ferry when he did so. If you put politics aside, and it is admittedly hard to do, then you can see just how ingenious this film is. If you are not already a Nazi, it certainly won't make you one, but you will be able to see how millions were taken in by well-choreographed pomp, pageantry, and ceremony.<br /><br />You must remember that the politically speaking, the people of that day were not like the people of today. Socialism had a very strong hold on the political imagination of the majority of the people and the National Socialist strain was just one of the socialist ideologies vying for the people's support. Yes, director Leni Riefenstahl was a master filmmaker, but it was really ace Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels who masterminded the spectacle that was the 1934 Nazi Party Congress shown here.<br /><br />As one reviewer said, the film was made partly to build party morale as Hitler did not yet have a firm hold on power. But it also spoke to other groups. Watch and see how it appeals not just to nationalist sentiment by depicting German unity across regional and class divides, but also manifests this putative unity to the international community. Don't think that Triumph of the Will did not have some of Germany's rivals quaking in their boots. I think the film ultimately helped Hitler neutralize domestic and foreign opposition to some of his early adventures like the remilitarization of the Rheinland.<br /><br />Those who look to the film for anti-Semitic tirades and militaristic saber-rattling will be disappointed. This film was meant to show foreign and domestic opponents how reasonable the Nazis were. Despite what many think today, anti-Semitism was \\"red meat\\" only for a small group of core fanatics, it was not an election winning issue and could only really be acted on when a dictatorship was firmly in the saddle.<br /><br />I think that Triumph of the Will should be required viewing for all high school students to show them how easily people can be taken in by well-disguised evil and so that they can learn to see through political blather.<br /><br />I ordered this Special Edition from an amazon partner but was sent the other one instead. As there is little difference between the two, I kept it. Now that there is a price differential, be sure that if you order this edition, that this is the one you get.<br />Those who look to the film for anti-Semitic tirades and militaristic saber-rattling will be disappointed.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Of course, all of these reviews for the CD are bogus.  It's not even out yet.  Reviews of the single are certainly legitimate.  It's Rush, you either like them or you don't.  What I find incredible is how some people have never moved beyond 2112.  C'mon!  It's 30 years ago!  I bet those people still wear bell bottoms and have huge, bushy sideburns.  You probably still use Hai Karate cologne and vote republican.  Republican state of mind = change is bad.  Change is not bad, it is what it is.  Different.  So, I guess you should drive home in your Vega, with your Pet Rock in the passenger seat.  There you can fire up your Lava Lap, smoke out in your basement and listen to your 2112 8-track tape.  Have a fun time!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When I first heard that Daniel Craig was going to play the next James Bond I was a bit suspicious.....a blond Bond??? But the more I heard about it the more I wanted to see it. I actually waited until it was released on dvd to see it. I can say, hands down, Craig is the best and the coolest Bond since Connery and Moore. Pierce Brosnan and Dalton have nothing on this guy!! Daniel Craig is really the ultimate. Superb acting, the action scenes are fantastic - it's been a long time since I've seen such a great and entertaining movie. Craig just melted into the Bond role so easy, and I don't think there's ever been a sexier guy playing Bond. I think Pierce Brosnan, even if he was pretty good, was a bit too proper and seemed to think about the way he looked too much. Craig doesn't seem to think about the way he looks so much, or so it seems....that's what makes him so good also. He seems to take it as a bit of a joke. He's not full of himself. I hope he stays that way. There's a lot more action in this movie (better action scenes) than in the other Bond movies. In a way it is a bit difficult to compare this one with the older movies from 1960's and 70's of course. I really hope he makes a few more Bond movies - apparently he's filming the next one now! Gotta love him!
B000GFLAI0|2.0|I keep listening to this CD hoping to start liking it. I readily admit that I am in the minority, but I don't get this album. To my ear, it sounds like one long, monotonous song from start to finish. When I am playing it in my office, and people walk in and hear it playing, they usually ask \\"What the heck are you listening to? It stinks.\\" It sounds a little like Bob is about to keel over and die. As a fan of his from the 60s, I feel stupid for saying this, but maybe it is time to retire. I'll keep listening and keep trying to like it...
B00005JPCF|2.0|Remember when we only got a few animated films every couple years? That's back when the producers of an animated film would take their time in developing a story, characters, and well-presented theme. Now, you just throw together as many \\"name\\" actors as you can, hire a group of animators and force out a story.<br /><br />And from this new animation environment comes such dreadfully dull and pointless cartoons as Happy Feet. The first 30 minutes looks like an animated remake of March of the Penguins. While the imagery is beautiful, it looked better in real life. A bunch of 80s pop songs are thrown together to tie in the idea that every penguin has a \\"heartsong\\". Unfortunately, the covers of these songs are lackluster and really should have been replaced with original material.<br /><br />So, a new penguin is hatched after being dropped by has father onto the cold ice, which we all learned from March of the Penguins, means instant death for the egg. So, this baby doesn't die, he just can't sing and wants to dance all the time. For this he is banished from the land of the penguins, because it's just \\"un-penguinlike\\" to dance around.<br /><br />Around the 45 minute mark is where Robin Williams comes in and actually adds life to the slowly sinking ship that is Happy Feet. But one man can only do so much, even if he is voicing multiple characters.<br /><br />Some kind of grand theme clearly depicting the lead penguin as a kind of restrictive religious leader results. Mumbles, the dancing penguin I mentioned earlier who's the main character embarks on a journey to find the \\"aliens\\" who are \\"stealing their fish\\". By this he means human fishermen of course.<br /><br />The last five to ten minutes becomes almost nonsensical, even for environmentalists who agree with the message that is being pushed onto viewers.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is not worth viewing at all. It's worth avoiding. The voice talent, apart from Robin Williams, is dismal. Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy... hearing their voices come out of penguins is not interesting or creative. The music is incredibly poorly done. When one of the main themes of the movie is music and \\"heartsongs\\", you could at least expect some decent musical numbers or original tunes. Not here. The story is borderline senseless, and the environmentalist theme is slammed down much to forcefully and ineffectively.<br /><br />But you know what? The animation is actually awesome. I can see why it got released in IMAX theatres because there are some incredible visual effects. They're just too far apart to save the film. And the visual stimulation doesn't keep 95 minutes of boring plot from being boring., Brittany Murphy... hearing their voices come out of penguins is not interesting or creative.

0977326403|5.0|This is probably a bit over the top, but Jim Collins book Good to Great changed our entire business concept. We had been using Michael Gerbers E-Myth course to systemise our business model (in an industry that is notoriously 'ad hoc', ie housebuilding) and our E-Myth coach suggested we read Good to Great. All the Directors and staff immediately got the message. Since then we have remodelled ourselves to become 'The Ethical Homebuilders'. Jim Collins new book covers all the issues that we have encountered, particularly in regard to identifying what appear to be intangible metrics. As with Good to Great the new book is a really easy read but with lots of really great insights. I would say that all company directors should read this book because even if you don't think you are in the social sector, your customers probably think you should be!
B000MZHW40|5.0|Aside from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou's brilliant acting choices, duly rewarded with Oscar nominations, Blood Diamond offers action, adventure, drama, and a political message that is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Director Edward Zwick gives his film a clean, produced look without taking away the realism and humanistic punch the story delivers.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly's character leaves something to be desired, but she's still a superb actress and offers a good deal to the story, although her storyline feels a bit contrived towards the end.<br /><br />The story is too intense and multifaceted for me to attempt to describe it. You can read the actual film description for that. All I can say is that Blood Diamond presents its message in an effective and moving way, using great special effects, camera work, acting, and scenery. It's a great movie, and you won't want to miss it.

0743289684|5.0|The theme that repeats throughout \\"Infidel\\" is moral courage. As a girl in Kenya, she endured a fractured skull due to the rage of one of her Islamic teachers. Yet as a teenager she embraced her Islamic faith, even while being ridiculed by some of her peers for wearing an Arab-style hijab. But she also privately questioned the criticisms of the west, especially by the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood. After returning to her native Somalia, she watched as her country descended into chaos. In one incident, with a knife to her throat, she used her quick thinking and courage to persuade her attacker to let her go.<br /><br />Things get very interesting when she is married off by her father to a man from Canada whom she greatly dislikes. She decides to flee to the Netherlands and seek political asylum, admittedly using false pretenses. Despite strong curltural pressure, she abandons her Islamic traditions and embraces the progressive culture of her adopted country. And finally after the attacks of 9/11, she even abandons her belief in God. While some may argue this shows a lack of morality, to me it shows intense and admirable moral courage. She stood by her convictions despite pressure from family, society, and even her personal safety.<br /><br />Finally, Ayaan Hirsi Ali is elected to the Dutch parliament where she fights strongly for the rights of immigrants and women. She ignores the threats of violence from fundamentalist Muslims, and openly criticizes the faith she was born to. With Theo van Gogh she makes the short movie \\"Submission Part I\\", which leads to the brutal killing of van Gogh by a Muslim extremist. Her own life in peril, she refuses to stay quiet or back down, and to this day continues to push for major reforms within Islam.<br /><br />Ayaan Hirsi Ali has earned the right to speak her mind, whether you agree or disagree with her. Her example will hopefully encourage many others to stand up and speak their minds. We should all have the moral courage to speak openly, without bowing to the violent threats of those who somehow are unable to use words to defend themselves.speak openly, without bowing to the violent threats of those who somehow are unable to use words to defend themselves.

This dvd gives insight into the complicated person Elvis was in terms of his humor, gifts, generosity of spirit, faith, ambitions, and humanity in a person who was so talented and good looking as to be veritably worshipped by so many. Amazing he kept as self-effacing a perspective as he did.  So wish the lifestyle hadn't taken him down.
B000000XCA|5.0|Even though \\"Proud Mary\\" might be CCR's staple, \\"Bayou Country\\" contains some of CCR's best work, along with the other tracks on this album that are not in Classic Rock Radios regular rotation. \\"Bootleg\\" and \\"Graveyard Train\\" and \\"Keep on Chooglin\\" are three of my favorite CCR songs, and the others are are excellent themselves.

B000NA28IE|2.0|I liked this movie a lot better the first time I saw it... <br /> <br />...when it was called \\"Star Wars\\". <br /> <br />I really liked the scene where Eragon was looking off into the sunset.  Boy, how original.  I haven't read Eldest, but I'm assuming that the princess is Eragon's sister.  Is this correct? <br /> <br />I was wondering when Han Solo was going to show up, and then of course he did. <br /> <br />I also like the scene where Eragon had to take a detour to go to Cloud City to rescue the Princess.  And then she tells him its a trap.  I was expecting the villian to say, \\"The magic is strong with you, Eragon, but you're not a Dragon Rider yet.\\" <br /> <br />I hear that the writer was only 16 when he wrote this.  Big deal.  Lot's of aspiring novelists are writing stuff at 16.  It never gets published for a reason.  Their brains are not fully developed, and they don't have enough life experience to absorb their influences and reshape them into something original.  I think this is definately the case here.  Mozart wrote his first symphony at 5 years old.  We never hear that one, though, do we?  <br /> <br />By the way, Aragon is one of the main characters in the Lord of the Rings.  Its like this kid isn't even trying to be original.  Changing the first letter, but leaving the name phonetically identical is NOT being original.
0743455967|5.0|I do not generally like horror stories, so I'm not a big fan of Mr. King's fiction.  Just because of the topic - not because of any flaws in the work.  I've seen the movie adaptations of several of his works - I saw The Shining when it first came out and can still remember it vividly.  He certainly knows how to create a compelling scene that draws the reader in, so as an aspiring fiction writer I - like every one else - want to hear how the best do it.  The autobiographical part was interesting, and demonstrates how one might use one's experiences to create ideas to use in stories.  The second part on writing and technique very much resonated with me.  There are some very good thoughts - I particularly like the idea of just getting the first draft out, and then revising.  I've done a lot of technical writing and find the same principle works in that domain - just get it out, then polish.<br /><br />If you like Mr. King's works, you will almost certainly love this insight into how he creates the stories you adore.  If you don't, you can still appreciate this intimate view of the creative process of a master.
B00004SZWB|4.0|...and with a title like THAT, I'd better tread lightly.  OK; the old Playboy Magazine/ancient hippies' phrase, a \\"mixed bag\\" comes to mind when reviewing this album.  It is a \\"given\\" that Stevie is simply one of America's greatest national resources, musically, so very, very versitile.  And on \\"July,\\" he displays his natural prowess, creating a field of sound just by himself with keyboards, synths, and let not forget that he's a heckuva harmonica player and a drummer, too!  Three songs really bear mentioning, though: A) \\"Happy Birthday,\\" a tribute to Dr. King; B) \\"Master Blaster/Jammin'\\" - please forgive an old hippie for inquiring, but did Stevie or da Rasta Mon, Bob Marley, do this first?  Nevertheless, \\"jamming,\\" it IS, and if you're a musician, you know what I mean by THAT...  And MY fave track is C) \\"Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" - Stevie's doing Country here!  A MARVELOUS, simply incredible track!  A true Rastamon buddy of my guitar player and me played this for us one Saturday while we were...(ahem!) \\"doing other business,\\" or something, and dared us, \\"OK: Play THIS!\\"  After about 30 minutes, we HAD it, even to our Rasta buddy's scrutinization - and that evening, we had a gig at a COUNTRY place, and with only \\"minor alterations,\\" we, the band, and the crowd LOVED it.  And that's what GOOD MUSIC IS, folks:  not some tunnel-visioned excess that only inner-city gangstas or (on the other end of the spectrum...like Ian Hunter said, \\"or is it only a few blocks away?\\") whiny, syrupy goons wearing cowboy hats can dig:  it appealed(s!) to both crowds!  I was there that weekend, I know!  Here's to You, Stevie!
B000002UB3|5.0|I'll add my 5.  This page is already plenty heavy with the well-deserved praise for this classic album.  I'll just lend a couple more comments.  Abbey Road gave the world a confirming insight into a still not-so-acknowledged fact: that the real talent in the Beatles was George Harrison.  As a good friend of mine said after Harrison died, \\"Paul McCartney is now in a two-way tie for most talented living Beatle.\\"  (Thinking man's joke).  I am not trying to invite the wrath of a classic rock dj somewhere or some know it all college freshman (born 20 years after this record was cut), but Abbey Road always struck me as the first great comprehensive rock album, where each individual song connected to its neighbors on the songlist.  Nice flow.  Anyway, a great piece of work.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was so disappointed when Planet Earth made its american debut to find Sigorney Weaver narrating. I refused to watch the series with her dry monotone, unemotional narration. Do not rate this series by her version. <br />David Attenborough could read a phone book and you would enjoy it! This man has a passion and devotion for what he does and with every word he speaks you feel it. Yes, I am a devoted David Attenborough fan and I own virtually every series he has done. Anything David Attenborough does is worth watching and if you own the Sigourney Weaver version I beg you to return it and buy the original BBC version of this series. You will not be disappointed. I am eagerly awaiting the \\"real\\" series and know it will be elegantly narrated as this series surely deserves.
B000MGVCFO|5.0|This gem from 1971 includes some of the Moody Blues best works.  The stand-out cut for this hybrid SACD is the amazing, \\"Procession\\", in which the Moodies attempted to document the progression of music through the years.  In stereo, it was always a revelation, but in surround sound the original quadraphonic mix is reproduced with exquisite clarity and definition.  The song literally dances around the room.  The entire album exudes new life through this new mix - however, the center speaker does not emit sound; only the four individual speakers (left and right front and left and right rear), plus the subwoofer.  The unreleased bonus tracks are a welcome surprise, with the original version of, \\"The Story In Your Eyes\\" at an extra half minute added.  It's more of a `free' mix towards the end sounding more like a tight `jam'.  The Hayward/Thomas addition of \\"The Dreamer\\" is a pleasant song and this is the first time it has been available.  Note that the bonus tracks are in stereo only; an unexplained mystery on an album mixed for multi-channels.  Also note that the bonus song, \\"After you Came\\" listed on the booklet does not exist on the CD - a major faux-paus!<br /><br />Please note that all Moody Blues Hybrid SACD's do not reproduce the front central channel - a result of the original quadraphonic tape mixing

B000MGVCFY|5.0|Considered to be the Moody Blues last cohesive album, \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" contains the same high quality of songwriting and instrumental brilliance of any predecessor.  Remastered from the original quadraphonic tapes, this SACD 5.1 surround recording takes full advantage of the original recordings.  An added bonus is four extra tracks never before heard.  There is the original extended eight plus minute version of \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" by John Lodge that contains a wonderful central instrumental piece.  Recorded at Mike Pinder's `Beckthorns' recording studio, the instrumental, \\"You And Me\\" contains great mellotron work (or the Chamberlain) and also pushed the envelope for ethereal sound.  The instrumental bonus of \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" also gives a new spiritual meaning to the original song version.  The last bonus song, \\"Island\\" is heard here for the first time, having never made it to \\"Octave\\".  It is a brilliant Hayward ballad that should have been released years ago.<br /><br />Please note that all Moody Blues Hybrid SACD's do not reproduce the front central channel - a result of the original quadraphonic tape mixing.
0061148512|1.0|Sylvia Plath was a mentally sick person who was encouraged by one of her psychiatrists to write. I have seen photographs of her and Ted Hughes, and Sylvia is in an appaling state. I can't even relate what Sylvia is doing in one of the photographs. It's sad. I hope that she found some comfort in writing, but honestly, was this meant to be published? <br /> <br />It's not a surprise that many readers find this repulsive. English teachers/professors should not require students to read this; it goes against every basic human tendency to be happy and not to be anti-life. I don't know how else to put this but the best writers aren't suicides. Don't read them. Their opus is one long goodbye note.
0060922583|1.0|I wish I could return this book, as I have very rarely been so disappointed with a book purchase.  I find the holographic model of the universe to be very interesting but I just could not finish this book - even after repeated attempts - due to inconsistencies in the writing style and poor editorial organization / formatting. It seemed to have been written in a very haphazard way or patchwork style, and this approach detracts from the authors credibility when he uses his holographic theory as a Panacea for anything and everything remotely paranormal.  I feel compelled to find a (recently published) similar book on the same subject, but written by a better author.    In my opinion the author seemed to ramble at times but they also glossed over details and got sidetracked on a few occasions by details that could have been included in addenda or footnotes.           <br />The bottom line:  I felt like I was reading a menagerie of hamstrung \\"CliffsNotes\\" summaries from  Psychology, Physics, Philosophy, and Cosmology textbooks cobbled together by a hung-over cheerleader with ADHD who was tripping on acid and rushing to meet an editors deadline.
B000065VB0|4.0|\\"Peter Gabriel\\" (3, 1980) is a pretty fine introduction to Peter Gabriel's solo career, and there are some great tracks, with contributions by some fine musicians (Phil Collins on drums in \\"Intruder\\", Robert Fripp on guitar in \\"I Don't Remember\\", Tony Levin on bass, Kate Bush doing backup vocals on \\"No Self Control, etc). It's got a big sound, and it's worth a listen. It's not my favorite album though, there's just something about it that is a little offputting in the way some of the tracks go, though I can't quite say what it is. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks would have to be \\"Intruder\\" which is pretty creepy, \\"No Self Control\\" (especially the middle bit), the bittersweet instrumental \\"Start\\", the upbeat \\"I Don't Remember\\" and the tragic buildup of \\"Family Snapshot\\". Basically the first half of the album I really like. \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" isn't too bad either. <br /> <br />The booklet of the remaster contains full lyrics and images from the era of the album.

B0007TKNL0|2.0|This movie had a lot of potential.  I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production.  BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth!  The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack.  I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing.  If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie.  The acting definitely falls flat.
074356619X|4.0|This principle is easy to grasp and uses basic thought ideas to generate positive thinking.  Obviously the negative reviewers are not utilizing the principles in the book.  Yes, I found many comments a stretch but the basic overall premise, if adopted by the mass population, would be a great asset to society.  This book parallels biblical thoughts and practices in many respects.  Unfortunately, the direct relationship to biblical scriptures would label this book 'religious' and would not sell as many copies.  If you are a Christian, relate what is in the book to what is found in the bible.  I plan to study and practice this principle this summer and see what happens.  Bottom line - If you utilize one thought in this book and come away with one good idea, it is worth it.

B000NA1OXY|4.0|Avril Lavigne. Everyone has an opinion on Avril, some love her and some hate her and she knows that and she'll sing about it, she's not afraid of the public and I don't get the idea she's afraid of record sales...I think she really just wants to make a good record and a record she can be proud of. Avril is a genuine artist with so many appealing qualities it's hard to hate her but also hard to love her. Personally, I love her. <br />Now, Onto the review. Let's start at the begining: <br /> <br />\\"Girlfriend\\" - Everyone knows this song by now. When I first heard it I really did love it. Don't get me wrong, I love sullen, mellow, angry Avril as much as the next...But \\"Girlfriend\\" shows her, pardon my pun, but Spit In Your Face attitude that we associated with the younger Avril. It's a great up-beat song to dance and laugh to...as well as get really drunk and have an awesome time. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"I Can Do Better\\" - My personal favorite on the album right now. The chorus is probably one of the catchiest, un-forgettable, can't get out of your head for days that i've heard in a long time. I also know that Avril is partial to this track as well and who could blame her. It's pure bratty fun pouring out of the speakers and into the air. I love the bridge when she get's rowdy and screamish...it's adorable. She should probably think about realeasing this as a single. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Runaway\\" - This is another great song. What i've picked up from this song is that you can have this crappy day where nothing goes right but at the end of the day you still feel alive. I especially love the lyrics in this track, simple and well defined.  <br /> <br />\\"The Best Damn Thing\\" - Not one of my personal favorites. It reminds me of a Gwen Stefani track, which is NOT a bad thing...It's just something that I've heard before. Is it still a good song?! Absolutly...the chorus is great. Just not one of my favorites. 6/10 <br /> <br />\\"When You're Gone\\" - I LOVE THIS SONG. It's one of Avril's best ballads in my opinion. The lyrics can make anyone want to cry if they've been through a situation when they love someone and deep inside they want back and nothing makes sense other than the two being together. It's really beautiful. The opening line, how she sings it...I seriously got goosebumps, as simple as it is \\"I always needed time on my own\\" ...It's perfect. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Everything Back But You\\" - This is just a great track to jam out to. It's    got a punk-pop feel to it and the lyrics are, yet again, bratty and spiteful...but it's great. It's about a guy who's away and sends \\"Avril\\" a postcard that says \\"I Wish You Were Her\\" and he left out the \\"E\\"...It's really a clever song. 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Hot\\" - I didn't like this song when I first heard it, I found it rather forgetable...but the more I listen to it the more I like it. It took some warming up to...It has classic Avril voice in it. The lyrics are a bit predictable and immaturely written, but it's worth a listen. It's about puppy love and the great things that come along with it. 7/10 <br /> <br />\\"Innocence\\" - This is a beautiful ballad. Avrils voice on this track is truely breathtaking. I believe this song is about the innocence of your first true love and how you never want it to end. The lyrics are also some of Avril's best. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"I Don't Have To Try\\" - This is my least favorite track on the album. The chorus is really good but that's about all it has going for it. It's spunky and fun, of course...It's a little \\"Rap-ish\\" ... but whatever...It's fun...just not my favorite. 3/10 <br /> <br />\\"One Of Those Girls\\" - This track is forgetable for me. I never remember any words or melodies...It's about girls who only want a guy for his money. 3/10 <br /> <br />\\"Contagious\\" - This is a fun track, yet again, a great chorus and some fun lyrics. Nothing much to say about it, though. 5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Keep Holding On\\" - We all know this song. It's great...some of Avril's best lyrics. 9/10 <br /> <br />Is it really \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" ... Sure, for me it is. I love Avril, and she'll keep on releasing great music for a long time...she'll grow as a lyracist and an artist. I don't believe this is her \\"Best Damn Thing\\" as of yet...I expect amazing things from Avril in the future . This album isn't for Avril fans who want Angry Girl Rock close to her sophomore album \\"Under My Skin\\" ... but her fans will love it, I love it...It's great. Give it a listen.

B0000DBJ2B|3.0|I have always wanted to purchased this DVD but I was disappointed with the Collector's Edition Boxed Set. The film was digitally remastered both audio and Anamorphic video but picture quality was not restored. What a pity! <br /> <br />I guess there will be an Ultimate Edition coming, some time in the future. <br />The reason for saying this is, Orphanage Animation Studios is producing the sequel and the title is Power of the Dark Crystal which is scheduled to release in spring 2008. I am sure they will do something with picture quality of the current release of Dark Crystal DVD Editions as well as enhancing the CGIs and other special effects in the movie. <br /> <br />So for those who want to buy or add this movie into his or her DVD library, I suggest that you wait till the sequel release next year. You might get better picture and technical quality, or perhaps other extra features, if/when they re-release the film in the DVD market. <br /> <br />Cal
B00000JXVK|5.0|I grew up 4 miles from Saddleback Park and up the street from Escape Country motorcycle park (now an uppity housing tract). I saw this film as an 11 year old boy and just loved it. It's a little corny but it's very inspiring. I was only interested in Motocross and desert racing, but it gives a good look at all motorcycle racing. And those classic bikes that I could never afford when I was young! It blew me away how lightning fast Malcolm Smith was (and still is, I hear). I had already been hooked on dirt bikes for 2 years when this film came out so it just egged me on more. Ain't been the same since!
B00005KHJM|5.0|Firstly let me say that my Grandfather was a successful film director and I myself run a successful video production business. <br />In the history of my cinematic viewing experience, which is quite long, i have never seen a film which has as many memorable scenes and passages as 'The Wicker Man'.  <br />I believe that the strength of this film lies in its successful use of all the available facets of film. <br />MUSIC: The composer Paul Giovanni produced a suite of beautiful and haunting songs which I can not only remember well, but can recall the lyrics to. How much music can you remember from CITIZEN KANE? <br />PHOTOGRAPHY: The mask wearing, the maypole, Summerisle, the seaplane's arrival, The landlord's daughter dancing - all strikingly beautiful images - and there are many more... <br />SUSPENSE: The plot grips you almost immediately. The Kafka-esque sense of conspiracy holds you in its spell right up until the final frame. <br />PROPS: I can't give away the ending, but in my view the greatest prop in cinema is used in the denouemont. <br />ACTING: Woodward is the star of this film, underacting excellently - his final terror is entirely believable because (at the end of the film) it is real. Suffice to say that the first time YOU see it is the first time HE saw it - and he made sure of this. <br />EROTICA: There is a strange erotic undertow to the film which I am not sure was even intentional. In any case, Britt Ekland's charm provide an erotic charge all of its own <br />SCRIPTWRITING: The script was written specifically for the film (not a book, a short story or a play) by Anthony Shaffer, who had a serious point to prove. He had always wanted to emulate his brother Peter's success and he put his heart & soul into this screenplay. This is no second rate horror flick - Shaffer's story touches the very methods that the human race employs to survive, in both spiritual and physical terms. <br />RHYTHM: The most undervalued of all cinematic devices, the action ofthis film dances delightfully, never slowing too much or racing ahead confusingly. <br />CHARM: An almost indefinable quality, but I believe the massive charm of the film owes a lot to an excellent atmosphere on set created by the fact that there were no 'megastars' on the film (this includes the director!) making selfish demands on others. It is a real team effort and everyone contributes everything they have. <br />DEPTH: I have seen this film a dozen times, and always spot something new in either the music, the scenes or the photography. If it was on TV again tonight I would tune in again. <br />SCENERY: I could probably watch a film about the verdant scenery of the Scottish Highlands without any kind of plot, but the village(s), buildings and interiors are quite enchanting as well. <br />There are even dashes of HUMOUR around (it's hard to take Chris Lee seriously in a dress!). <br /> <br />To sum up, both Christopher Lee & Ed Woodward insist that this is the greatest film they have ever been a part of. They are both correct. <br /> <br />I believe that the consise version of the film is actually better than the director's cut. I can see why the Director & his stars may have been upset that they were not consulted about the cutting, but the shortened version is almost inexplicably tighter & more convincing. <br /> <br />ON NO account see the Nicholas Cage remake. The one thing that made me despair most about this terrible rehash was that some people may watch the remake and decline to watch the original. The only similarity between the two is a vague parallel between the plots. <br /> <br />I don't think that Robin Hardy is the best director of all time. I think he was very fortunate to have this script, budget & cast, and did very well not to make a mess of it (there is some indication that he would have liked to slow it down - which would have been a mistake). He allows the film to happen and it works out very well. <br /> <br />I think that the powers that be (Hollywood, for instance) would like us to believe that all great films are made by great directors, but I do not subscribe to this view. <br /> <br />There are so many various elements which have to reach conflux in the creation of a film that more often than not, they go wrong and fail. Direction is obviously important, but it only one of these elements. <br /> <br />Magically, all of the elements have combined uniquely well in the film THE WICKER MAN, and we should be grateful for such miracles.
B000NA1OXY|2.0|Well, the first single, \\"Girlfriend,\\" should give you a clue. For those of us who thought her last album, 'Under My Skin,' was a great step forward (from a decent debut album, 'Let Go') will lament this major step back. Apparently Avril really wants us to believe that she's punk; unfortunately this means immature cheerleading rants (think Gwen Stefani at her most annoying) with the opening track and repeated in nearly identical fashion in a couple other songs on the album, with obvious borrowings from Toni Basil's eighties hit, \\"Mickey\\" (\\"Hey, Mickey, you're so fine,...\\"). The rest of the album doesn't fair much better (with a few exceptions, like \\"Innocent\\"). Take the lyrics from \\"Hot\\" as a case in point:<br /><br />\\"You make me so hot<br /><br />Make me wanna drop<br /><br />It's so ridiculous<br /><br />I can barely stop<br /><br />I can hardly breathe<br /><br />You make me wanna scream<br /><br />You're so fabulous<br /><br />You're so good to me baby, baby\\"<br /><br />Sorry, this is crap. The music isn't much more creative. There's a general banality running throughout the album that simply wasn't found on her last album, 'Under My Skin.' And I think it's interesting to note that 'Under My Skin' was co-written with Chantal Kreviazuk, a legitimate singer-songwriter, and co-produced by Chantel's husband, Raine Maida (of the brilliant rock band, Our Lady Peace) among others. The new album, however, was co-produced by Luke Gottwald (aka Dr. Luke) with such credits as Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Lady Sovereign, Missy Elliott, Pink, Mos Def, The Backstreet Boys, Daughtry, and Paris Hilton. Uhhhh, no thanks.<br /><br />I know this has been a harsh review, but I do this in hopes that the next album will be much improved. Avril is still young with a long career ahead of her.

It doesent say this, but it also has a video on it, It looks like a transformers movie, very good.  Combine that with the fact that it is linkin park, how much better can you get?!
068987474X|5.0|When I first bought this book, I laughed at some of the things that Greg said.  I thought that surely there must be some reason why a guy doesn't call, or doesn't want to date you exclusively, or won't talk about marriage.  After making countless excuses for my guy, it turns out that Greg was right all along.  He just wasn't that into me!  I could have saved myself a year of trouble and walked away at the first warning sign.  Read this book.  It will help you recognize when a man is just not that into you so you can move on to something better.
0131103628|4.0|As somebody else said, this book is NOT for a programming beginner - its style of writing is quite terse with few or no actual illustrations (via drawings of flow-charts {or equivalent}, programming-structure, etc.) versus a lot of text to read through.  To make matters worse, C (and its derivatives like C++, C#, etc.) is a very LEAN (and truly MEAN!!) programming language 'per se' - with relatively few prewritten macros, subroutines and functions, one can get frustrated very quickly!  [Furthermore, C and its derivative compilers don't attempt any error-recovery of faulty compiles - the tiniest error can therefore upset matters in spite of a fundamentally worthy algorithm!] <br /> <br />Those who've already had previous programming experience will love this book (especially if they like 're-inventing the wheel', which lean & mean programming entails);  others would do better to invest either in another book, another computer-language (my favourites in spite of their being hard to get to - especially the former! - are PL/I and Ada) and ideally both!
B000031EGV|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was like 9 or 10.  I was so into it.  I went out and bought the game right after seeing it.  It all starts out with a little boy \\"Alen\\" is having a tough time.  He is poicked on at school, does not have any friends and his parents want him to go to a school in which he does not want to go.  Then one day he goes to a place where there is a company doing construction.  He hears drums playing.  He finds a game called Jumanji.  He runs home and hides it.  Then his parents leave to do something and him and a girl start playing.  Things start to happen as they do.  Bugs start flying around and bats start flying.  The game comes alive.  Then the boy rools something and the game bord tells him \\"in the jungle you must wait until the dice reads 5 or 8.  He is sucked into the game.  The girl gets so affraid that she runs out of the house with bats chasing her.  Like 20 years go by and a lady and her sisters 2 kids (I think it was her sister) move in.  The kids find the game and start playing.  One of them rolls a 5 or 8 and the man is set free.  He has aged as the time has gone by.  He ends up playing the game with them to finish it.  But he needs to get the girl whom played with him all those years ago to play as well because it is her turn.  She screams when he arrives to ask her and he tricks her into playing.  They all play the game and alot of crazy exciting things happen.  I can not tell you what happens because that would ruin it for you.  Buy this movie.  It is well written.  Has good acting from people such as Robin Willams, Kirsten Dunst, and Bradley Pierce.  It will make you laugh and suck you in just like the game did Alen.
B000O178BY|5.0|Fellow NIN fans . . . come on, this is a great album . . . but stop saying \\"best since 'The Downward Spiral'\\" . . . ok.  Just a request . . . cause honestly when i take a look at it \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was the least unique album trent was involved with.  I love NIN, have since the first time I have heard them . . . there are 2 sides to NIN, theres the more angry Techno-Pop style of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"The Fragile\\", and there is the more raw explosive style of \\"Broken\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\", this album sits more in the angry Techno-Pop style . . . hey, there my favorite group allright, but they are what they are lol.  Industrial = skinny puppy and front 242 and NIN doesnt quite fit in that genre IMHO.  Now, this album was a nice reminder of what made me plunge into the ranks of Reznorites everywhere.  It starts off with a few tracks that are pretty radio friendly, and then descends (to my favorite parts of the album lol) into a massively jumbled randomly scattered spectrum of apparently random noises that only Trent and co. could compile to make any sense at all . . . oh yeah, and the lyrics are heavily politically motivated . . . the main problem with the previous album \\"with teeth\\" was that it seemed to have no direction or motivation, kinda like they made the album cause they were bored . . . this album has more direction then a cruise missile wich makes it very interesting to interpret . . . probably the wrong way . . . and differently each time ive listened to it so far.  Oh yeah, one more thing, if you haven't bought this album yet . . . and you have questionable speakers, be sure to turn the volume down to about 30 percent before you reach track 7 and beyond . . . the bottom drops out of the bass spectrum bye that time and you could lose cheap speakers.  One more request to the comments before me . . . do the math, if you have 5 albums (1pretty hate machine, 2broken, 3the downward spiral, 4the fragile, 5with teeth) in 17 years . . . how could it be possible that each album has a 5 year break in between?  Just a thought . . .e possible that each album has a 5 year break in between?  Just a thought . . .
B000FILW86|5.0|I've always loved Cheap Trick, but was blase enough about it in the late 70s and 80s. I think I just took them for granted. I remember seeing them in about 1979 and being blown away but was just to immature to understand why ... exactly. <br />Now, all these years later, I'm on my way to work listening to the bob and tom show on the radio last May and their guests are Cheap Trick, promoting their latest record. I was momentarily swept away by nostalgia and wondered, \\"can these guys still play?\\" Then they basically melted the stereo with a fifteen minute set of their old and new. I remember \\"Sayonara Suicide\\" (hope that's correct) as being the hottest live performance I'd heard in years. The music was still everything it was before, enhanced by better broadcast sound, and Robin Zander's voice, well let's just say it does very interesting things to a woman's body chemistry ... lol <br />So I decided to go out and buy a few Cheap Trick cd's and the new one, Rockford. It's been so much fun catching back up with the hyper and slightly schizo musical world that is Cheap Trick. Musically, Rockford is a crowning achievement by anyone's standards and it sucks that the rock station in my town (El Paso Texas) just couldn't see fit to work in any of the tracks among the melancholy, self obsessed junk they like to play. <br />I'm hoping to travel somewhere to see Cheap Trick perform this year and I really hope they are inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame this next year. <br />BUY ROCKFORD AND CHEAP TRICK FOREVER!! <br />Allison in Texas
B000EWBKKI|5.0|it may not be the extended version with cut scenes. I will say i watched this movie on digital cable and compared it to the blu0ray version and trust me there is a big difference more colors no smearing of facial features like on the cable version and the sound is incredible. If your hdtv sucks then blu-ray version may suffer if the difference is not noticable its your tv <br />and not the blu-ray disc. This is a must have for terminator fans!
B000NQR7KM|5.0|I don't have a working SACD player, but the dvd, in dts, is incredible. I've heard this album a thousand times before, but I was constantly hearing instruments I never noticed before. Crystal clear sound, better than a lot of \\"new\\" releases. <br /> <br />I didn't look at all the extras, but the main one is a 40 minute concert from 1976. The picture and sound aren't all that great, but seeing Bill Bruford playing drums makes it all worthwhile. <br /> <br />Throw away all your other versions of this classic and replace it with this one. You won't be dissapointed.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Listening to this album was the first time I'd been let down by a Wilco record since my first time hearing 1999's Summerteeth.  That album has since grown on me significantly, and Sky Blue Sky has certainly earned its place in the ranks as well.  Listeners distressed by the heavy-handed, sometimes droning nature of its predecessor will be delighted to find that Wilco have revisited, not returned to, the loose, swaggering nature of the classic Being There.  Drummer Glenn Kotche once stated in an interview with Modern Drummer magazine that he has a stronger emotional connection to simple, effective beats, and this minimalist approach is no more apparent than on songs like \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Impossible Germany\\".  His playing is reserved yet flavorful, eventually becoming vital to the overall feel of the music.  The same applies to guitarist Nels Cline, though his outings are much more technically dazzling.  If a colloquial saying could be coined describing his playing, it would be Chet Atkins on meth.  I mean that with all due respect to both parties, naturally.  He soars through warmly textured and playfully emotive solos that, despite their virtuosity, never lose sight of a good tune.  Bassist John Stiratt is as beautifully understated as ever; his tone and profoundly solid playing have always been essential to the group's sound, this being no exception.   <br /> <br />    Being that Wilco is essentially lead singer/songwriter Jeff Tweedy's brainchild, the discussion and review of each Wilco release ultimately culminates around where he has taken the band both musically and lyrically.  It would seem as though the dark monsters that haunted him on A Ghost is Born could still be lingering, but Sky Blue Sky picks its chin up right from the first line: \\"Maybe the sun will shine today/the clouds will roll away/maybe I won't be so afraid\\".  The album as a whole harbors a feeling of deep yet undeclared happiness, the kind of melancholy that feels good.  Tweedy has brutally honest and candid things to say this time around, thankfully avoiding precious wordplay in favor of a more direct approach.  The best part is, this is only discovered upon repeated listens.  Songs like the breezy \\"You Are My Face\\" and the revelatory \\"Side With the Seeds\\" seem like mere filler at first, but are in fact brimming with a genuinely honest musical energy not felt since Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  After four or five thorough listens, this record has endeared itself to me much like Neil Young's On the Beach, Joni Mitchell's Blue, or Van Morrison's Astral Weeks.  It is easily Wilco's warmest album and, like those classic albums, is likely the purest, most honest document of a band that rightly deserves the title \\"relevant\\".
B000O178BY|5.0|First things first. You can't compare this album to any of the others that Trent has created because...its not those albums!! This album is amazing and for all the reasons that makes Trent an amazing performer and entertainer. One can never refer to Nine Inch Nails as being to polished and perfect because if you have been to any of their shows it is picture perfect and then some. This album is hypnotic and chaotic in the strain of what we love and yern for from such a person like Trent Reznor. As a musician I look at everything he has created and I have to say he never lets me down because he shall never release anything he is not happy with. Music is made from the deepest part of ones being not from depression. intensity may stem from depression but that is not all that there was when creating The Downward Spiral. A creative individual has created each of these masterpieces and Year Zero is no exception from the opening drum beats to the lyrics presented with each song. <br /> <br />Enjoy this CD like a fresh experience. There will never be another Pretty hate machine or Downward Spiral because that is a chapter past of a larger story. Its called growth.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Wow. I am surprised at folks saying they don't like this album as much as the previous. I would have to say that I think this one is the best out of all of them. Josh's voice has matured even more, and the songs fit his voice much more comfortably than some of the previous recordings, especially on his first album, that were a little out of his range (too low.) And who cares about what February Song is supposed to mean for a title. It leaves room for pondering. I'm sure when it was written it was intended to be titled that for some particular reason. That is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. There is plenty of emotion in this album. I think his emotion is much more mature than in his previous albums.
B000OCXF0Q|4.0|The way this record was made is rather interesting... I want to make things clear, I LOVE Avril and her music, and that I do like the songs on this album.. It's just that I think that she's taken a step back in terms of personal growth and maturity despite being married... <br />First, the look... Pink hair extensions?? So Christina Aguilera in 2002, though Christina's was dark red and black extentions... <br />Next we go into the making of the record. I can say, from what is documented, about a third of the recording was done when she was high from alcohol... Like I've mentioned, the process maybe rather interesting, like using the sound of blowing into a beer bottle at the end of Girlfriend, but it somehow just doesn't connect to the Avril we knew before and that it seems a little childish... <br />However, there are nice creative input from other famous artists, like her husband, Deryck Whibley (Sum 41) and Travis Barker (Blink 182).. <br />Overall, I think Avril is great! Though, she may need a little more time in the maturity department.. However, I think that the antics of her recording process haven't compromised the quality much and I can't wait to see what comes next!
B000O178BY|4.0|There's no point in repeating what so many others have said about the music on this CD: it's great, noisy, funky, experimental pop. It's wonderful. And as far as the marketing campaign (though Trent Reznor refuses to call it that) involving a web scavenger hunt that challenges and involves rock fans in a refreshingly new way, all I'll say is: kudos Trent. <br /> <br />What I would like to point out, however, is something I do not believe anyone else has drawn attention to: Trent Reznor's nightmare future America, at least as portrayed on the back cover of the CD, is shockingly similar to Mexico City in 2007!
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|65 years after it first it theaters, CASABLANCA remains a perfect film, a timeless masterpiece, and one of the most beloved American cinematic treasures. There are only a handful of films from the 'golden era' that can still captivate any audience, even those with no interest in classic film, no less black & white films.  <br /> <br />Warner Brothers gave this crown jewel the deluxe treatment on regular DVD about 3 years ago, and it was impossible to conceive that even the glories of 1080p HD DVD could really make it look THAT much better... <br /> <br />Well, it DOES. Several people I know use this CASABLANCA HD DVD as their 'demo disc' for their home theater. Despite B&W, monaural sound, and a square aspect ratio, the clarity is unreal, and it only heightens the enjoyment of one of the greatest films ever made. <br /> <br />Kudos to Warner for giving this to fans so early in the HD game. There is a terrible paucity of truly great films available in Hi Def right now, regardless of format. None of the other studios seem to recognize they have libraries, and relegate their releases to the recent flavor of the month (for the most part). Warner has been the top video label for years, and this is just another reason why. They really know what they're doing. <br /> <br />All the exceptional special features created for the regular DVD have been carried over, and although they are standard definition, the upconversion makes them look better than ever. <br /> <br />This is truly an ESSENTIAL part of any HD library.
B00004VVN9|1.0|Brainstorm is a great movie, but I wouldn't know that from the viewing I just had.  The quality of this DVD is absolutely terrible.  We spent the entire movie adjusting for extremes in brightness and contrast and still could not view some segments of the movie at all--the screen was completely black in some parts.  You'd be better off buying or renting a VHS copy.
B00005N9CV|5.0|When I hear people ask why \\"they\\" don't make good music anymore, my response is \\"They do!!  At least, Diana Krall does.\\"  This is a wonderful album.  Wonderful.  Don't let the nitpickers, trying to sound lofty, steer you wrong.
0788815490|4.0|There really is not much that I can add plotwise to the other excellent reviews here at Amazon.What I can say though is that Helena Bonham Carter has often been referred to as \\"the Queen of costume dramas\\" which has unfortunately pigeonholed her into being some kind of one dimensional charicature of herself in some eyes.Well....it is in Henry James' WINGS OF THE DOVE (one of the better James\\" novel adaptations to screen) under the very able direction of Iain Softley where \\"Mrs.Tim Burton\\" blossoms and shows that she has a pair of eyes that can express the complete range of emotions without saying a word.(Didn't Norma Desmond,the great silent screen star of SUNSET BOULEVARD say,\\"We didn't have words...we said it with our eyes!\\"?).Though WINGS OF THE DOVE is certainly a fairly engaging story in it's own right (it is a melodrama that certainly follows some formulas),it is Miss Bonham Carter's beyond-admirable performance that makes this beautifully filmed in the streets and canals of Venice tragic love triangle really worth the watching alone.Some actresses SO fit the bill as their characters (I am reminded of Meryl Streep in SOPHIE'S CHOICE and Fernanda Montenegro in CENTRAL STATION,and currently Helen Mirren in THE QUEEN)that to ever to consider a remake down the line by some director would mean having to outdo what is already perfection.Bonham Carter hit an absolute career defining moment in this film.Here she is not the ingenue of the 1983 ROOM WITH A VIEW,but a full come-of-age bonifide star who received both nominations from the Hollywood Foreign Press and The Academy.She deserved every bit of those accolades in the role of Kate,for WINGS OF THE DOVE really is Kate's story anyway. <br /> <br />As for the supporting cast,Linus Roach is more than suitable as Merton and plays well opposite Miss Carter.I,personally,have never found the parts of the Americans played by Alison Elliot and Elizabeth McGovern to be anything at all.I truly feel that Miss Elliot fails to capture the necessary fragility/emerging sexual woman role with any kind of true conviction as Millie Theale.As for Miss McGovern,the part is limited at best,but there is not much there in the delivery nor in the look.
B00031TXBI|2.0|\\"What I saw\\" written about the album was quite different form what I heard. Having listened to the album several times I can't figure out what it is that distinguishes JF's album from any talented school-rock-band. The harmonic surprises seem to be limited to a major-minor change and the all-to true statement \\"and then foresight comes / I've lost sense of it all\\" in what ought to be the album's title song \\"Emptiness\\".  <br />Please! No more Puff-the-magic-dragon lines \\"I see clouds laughing again\\" and more original ideas \\"accidents have come straight to you / and you've changed your point of view\\". <br />
1416914285|1.0|I was familiar with Cassandra Clare during her BNF days in the Harry Potter community. But I never read any of the fanfiction that she was so famed and maligned for -- frankly, the subject matter just didn't interest me. I understand there were leather pants. <br /> <br />But I did get a chance to see the first chapters of this book at the end of last year, and I've since flipped through a copy in the bookstore. And you know, it made me really glad that I didn't waste any time and eyestrain on her fanfic.  <br /> <br />The book is a clumsy attempt at being witty and literary, full of the purplest prose and dubious metaphors. The characters are two-dimensional and unoriginal, and the POV is incosistent and jerky, and the plot is derivative and cliched -- recycled from a half-dozen mainstream sci-fi and fantasy TV shows, films, and books, and cobbled together rather shamelessly. <br /> <br />The jokes are flat at best, and the author's grasp of the age group about which (and for whom) she is writing seems tenuous. The main characters are utterly unconvincing as adolescents, and their forced dialogue is predictable at best, painful at worst. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a ridiculous and uncompelling train wreck of a YA fantasy novel. And while I don't recall if leather pants were involved, there were parachute pants. <br /> <br />They were the best part, really.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am not usually interested in history but this is truly a gem.  It is so much more than a historical account of WWII.  It pulls you in and feels current because the drama of the storylines still apply today.  I have come to admire the men of Easy Company and feel blessed to have such a rich history.  Any person who isn't familiar with this part of history owes it to himself to watch this series.
B000JRYOPG|2.0|Two poor Jamaican youths decide to rob a vendor to get some money. The rest of the movie is a mindless repetition of Jamaicans stealing and killing each other, both in Jamaica and America. It never rises above a third-rate in plot, acting, characterizations, or special effects.
B000MV8AE0|2.0|This movie has tolerable acting by Harris and Kruger, but why mispronounce Beethoven's name? Van instead of von? At least the German born Kruger could have gotten them to correct that fluke. <br /> <br />If you took away the music this wouldn't be worth watching, and I for one would not recommend its purchase. Buy an album of the Concert Gebouw's recording instead.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I did not have time to read over the hundreds of comments about this movie, but I did feel the need to add my 2 cents. Yes the Holocaust was a terrible thing and no place for comedy. However, this film was not meant to make light of the horrors so many suffered. It was meant to show how two wonderful people put love before their own comfort. Without giving away the story, this movie really showed the extent a parent and spouse will go to protect their children from pain and suffering. Though it is true that many children did suffer horribly and die in the camps, there are stories here and there of those who did manage to hide and survive. This is a fictional story representing hope for all of us despite the worst possible scenario. I truly feel it is a must-see, and an inspiration for everyone. Learn the lesson meant - make the best out of the situation you find yourself in, and family is the most valuable possesion you have.
0375831002|5.0|Told from the point of view of Death, this novel chronicles the adolescence of a fascinating young girl in Nazi Germany. Zusak holds everything together with his poetic writing and quirky, non-linear storytelling, letting snippets sneak in at unexpected and often moving times. It is an intensely personal story, hung, oddly but poignantly, on the conceit that Death is as afraid of people as we are of Death. While a bit clunky and prosaic at times, for the most part, I found the writing to be efficient, the characters alive, the story moving. I tore through about 200 pages today to finish, pushed onward by the hints sprinkled generously into the pages, and swallowing back tears.
B000ANXLB2|5.0|The Abbado DVD cycle is worth every cent and more - its gorgeous <br />Same for Bernsteins  Ode to Freedom DVD <br />But <br />This cycle <br />Is AWESOME <br />I think Luigi would smile <br />Cheers

B0000074GK|5.0|Backstreet Symohony is a great release from a great band that simply flew under most people's radar because they were never able to get that hit single in the States. Thunder plays simple straightforward blues based rock with great hooks and melodies(they are NOT a \\"hair band\\" as they are sometimes lumped in with). Full of guitars, great vocals(I really like Don Bowes' voice) and lyrics with tounge in cheek humor this is just good FUN rock'n'roll. <br /> <br />Song Highlights include: Dirty Love, Backstreet Symphony, Love Walked In, An Englishman On Holiday(should be on every barroom jukebox), Gimme Some Lovin'(good cover) and Distant Thunder. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of guitar based rock, Thunder delivers it in spades and Backstreet Symphony is worthy of a place in your collection.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|As many have noted...be warned...this is an edited version. While you may like the language bleeped, it stills affects the musical flow... (I bought the full version \\"deluxe\\" with DVD insert.  There is nothing on this that matches the best songs from Avril's first two albums. There is some good, solid rock-on rock 'n' roll with waves of sound. It's worth a listen.  However, this CD is a step back, a small step, but nonetheless. It seems derivative of what went before, without doing anything special. Lavigne consolidates here rather than moves forward. Regarding the language issue on which many have commented....I'm not a prude, but you have to wonder at her stupidity in being this foul. It serves no purpose. It's \\"faux\\" cool. If she can't be cool and can't write lyrics without doing that, maybe she's in fact not very cool and not very good. Again, it's not a matter of prurience. It's more a question of \\"why?\\" When you drop so many verbal bombs, it serves no purpose other than shock value. It diverts attention from everything else. It's just pointless crudity. No upside. All pretension.

B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor is making leaps and bounds.  He's cleaned up his act, released an amazing concert DVD (\\"Beside You in Time\\"), and now he's delivered this concept album (only two years after 2005's \\"With Teeth\\" compared to the usual 5 plus between albums) which focuses on everything from politically charged conspiracies to the end of the world.  \\"Year Zero\\" is loud, noisy, obscene, powerful, and shockingly brilliant all at the same time.  From lead single \\"Survivalism\\" to superb tracks like \\"The Beginning of the End\\", \\"Me, I'm Not\\", \\"Capital G\\", \\"My Violent Heart\\", \\"God Given\\", \\"Meet Your Master\\", \\"The Greater Good\\", and the closing \\"Zero Sum\\" are incredibly intricate in their design and catchy and memorable to boot.  The industrial edge that Nine Inch Nails helped pioneer is more apparent with \\"Year Zero\\" here than it was with \\"With Teeth\\" or \\"The Fragile\\", and is undoubtedly the best album to come from Trent and co. in years.  With a bevy of hype surrounding it and a marketing campaign (including hidden URL's) that couldn't have been pulled off better, \\"Year Zero\\" is a sight to behold.  Indeed, the end of the world has never sounded better; \\"Year Zero\\" is the undisputed album of the year so far.
B000INAXGU|5.0|This review is written for the fans. You have all of the other songs on this album, but why buy the CD?  The two new songs are AWESOME!  I am especially a fan of \\"Radio\\" - it is the sexiest tour de force about a threesome ever made.  Granted, I am NOT into threesomes, but there is something about Jay singing, \\"Three's not a crowd, I'm a man, I'm a man\\".  This song totally turns me on.  Get yourself into the mindset before listening to it.  Then, \\"Runaway\\" is just a great song, nothing hidden, no secret messages - just a great song. I can't wait for what they (or just Jay) comes up with next. Yes, you can download the songs \\"elsewhere\\", but give Jay and the band the benefit of the doubt and fork out the bucks for this album - it's a winner - and while you're at it, get the video DVD too, it rocks and has some videos that are hard to find. ENJOY!
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Human emotions can be ugly things. This film explores them all. Anger, hatred, sexuality all are shown here in an animalistic raw, in your face ,way. Although this movie is hard to watch there is a feeling that for all of our horribleness we can be quite remarkable in our human range of emotions. There is no happy ending here,no win + win situation, just a  feeling that life is hard but, we move on and live the best way we can. Overall I thought this film was very beautiful and raw, an interconnected puzzle of human lives and decisions. Perhaps a call to treat our selves a bit more gentle.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|i hadnt seen this since its initial release 30 years back, and at the time i was among the many who expressed disappointment.  now, it has grown considerably in my estimation.  while the acting of ryan o'neal still leaves something toi be desired, everything else about the movie stands out: a subtle script, fine performances, and of course magnificent to look at.  the battle sequences are harrowing, but the infighting and backstabbing of the various court intrigues (not to mention the parallel intrigues among the rural set) are whats really harrowing.  kubrick made so many dark movies, and this one was so misunderstood.  it doesnt rank in my own list with his 4 great science fiction films (strangelove, 2001, clockwork, eyes), but thats more a matter of personal preference.  a masterpiece -- even if we are only recognizing it as such a generation later. <br />
B000FGGE68|4.0|Good action, visuals, special effects and futuristic technology. I'm not sure what all the whining is about. Take it for what it is - a sci-fi adventure that doesn't pretend to be anything else. I've seen much much worse.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|its a good tho overpraised movie.  i liked the cast most of all, especially greg kinnear who is as usual underrated.  paul dano is kinda hot as the teen slacker, and abigail breslin (almost as fat as big bro spencer, but vastly more talented) is quite good in a disarming way, tho i doubt theres more there than what we have already seen (ill be glad to be proven wrong, btw).  alan arkin, of course, is alan arkin: giving the quintessential supporting performance as the raunchy heroin-snorting family patriarch.  still, the writing is a trifle too obvious to me to bring this into the ranks of the really good. <br />
0743424425|5.0|Jack Torrance is an ordinary man in so many ways. He has a wife and child, he works, and he battles his addiction (his happens to be alcohol). His life could be any of millions told in America. He is a troubled man following his passion (his happens to be writing), and just `needs a break' for his career and life to really take off. What he gets is an offer to work as a caretaker at a ski resort that has to close during the winter because it simply snows \\"too much.\\" This represents, on the surface, not only a job, but a chance for solitude to write, a vast amount of space for his kid to explore (and thus leave him alone to finish his play), and hopefully something for his wife to occupy herself with. What writer wouldn't jump at the chance to have three months away from \\"reality\\" with no bills to pay, no commutes. Just 3 months in a winder paradise alone to write.    It has been often said that art imitates life, and that life initates art. Regardless of whether the chicken or egg came first (art vs. life) Surface impressions are hardly accurate in real life, and even more so in this story. Jack's slow, painful decent into alcohol withdrawal is paralleled by his son's budding psychic abilities. Of course it doesn't help the situation that the hotel they are caring for is haunted by more ghosts than one would expect to find at a Halloween party at The Addam's family household. Things disintegrate pretty badly from there. I avoid details as there is no sense spoiling the story. That is after all the beauty of reading horror stories, being surprised by what is hiding under the bed. Ultimately, this is Stephen King for the \\"non-Stephen King fan.\\" It is highly accessible and a very fast read, despite the 704 pages it boasts.

6305910340|5.0|SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is a wonderfully acted and produced film that should appeal to a wide audience.  It is particularly appropriate for tweenagers and early teens but anyone who appreciates good movies can enjoy this. I am totally ignorant about chess and I loved it but for chess fans I would think it is a must see.
0743496728|4.0|This is my second Jodi Picoult book, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first (Keeping Faith) up until the very end, which felt somewhat soap operish, and imo took away from the plot of the book. As other's have stated before me, Nineteen Minutes deals with the serious issue of school shootings. <br /> <br />The book did a good job of coming at this issue from all angles, from the victims, to the shooter, to the police, etc. While some characters were more interesting than others, I found all of them to have well rounded personalities and understandable reactions to the tragedy Picoult writes of.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately the ending soured so much of the book for me I doubt I will go back and read again. I would reccommend this book to friends, but be forewarned the \\"surprise twist\\" isn't all that great or interesting. In fact I found it cartoonish.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Drumline is the story of a Devon (Nick Cannon), cocky, young New York kid who gets the chance to attend a university in Atlanta on a percussion scholarship.  Devon has a great deal of talent but his self-centeredness causes him to lose sight of the goal of the band (\\"One Band! One Sound!\\") and to clash with his section leader, Sean aka Big Brother \\"Iron Man\\" (well played by Leonard Roberts), who disapproves of Devon's attitude and resents Devon's natural talent.  Sean finally gets through to Devon about his attitude (\\"So go on at be the man - without the line.  You're the best, Devon, but when you're on the field, nobody hears you.  They hear the band, one band.\\") and together they help put together a routine that helps win the big marching band tournament.  The main side plot involves the band director's clash with the university president.  The director Dr. Lee (fine performance by Orlando Jones) places a great deal of importance on musicianship but sometimes loses sight that music is about entertainment as well.  In the end, Devon, Sean, and Dr. Lee all gain a new and broader perspective.  In the other side plot, Devon meets a great girl (played by the extremely hot and talented Zoe Saldana) with looks and brains who has her own issues about pursuing her desires and what her parents want.<br /><br />Let me comment for a moment about the Editorial Reviews above.  First, I marched \\"corps\\" style in marching band and then military style in the Marine Corps and this style of marching is exactly opposite of \\"military precision of college football marching bands.\\"  It is high stepping and full of highly choreographed dance.  Second, Devon is not a \\"street drummer\\" as in the first scene he is playing with his high school band and you never see him playing on the street.  My two cents on the Editorial Reviews.<br /><br />I found \\"Drumline\\" to be a great film which I can watch again and again.  The bands are fantastic, the story is entertaining, and the music is \\"off the chain.\\"  It's the kind of film of which I wish I could be a part.  Aside from a few bad words and some sexy dancing, this film is suitable for families with older children and the PG-13 rating is apt.  I recommend it highly with five stars.the chain.\\"  It's the kind of film of which I wish I could be a part.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Let me first say that this is one of the best Bond films every made, really really good.  Danial Craig brings something new and different to the role and acts it out very well.  Where this movie falls short is that it's not really a Bond movie.   <br /> <br />Casino Royale doesn't have cheap gadgets or stupid humor.  It is a much more serious Bond film that focuses on action, and is sad in the end.  This type of emotion hasn't been shown since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  Some dire hard Bond fanatics may hate this movie because it has a plot, is very sad and compelling, and is an excellent action movie.  Almost all other Bond films aren't serious like this.  Also Casino Royale is based on the novel, but really doesn't follow it very closley.   <br /> <br />While Casino Royale is not very Bond like, it is an excellent movie.  And perhaps, it is a good thing that it doesn't continue with the cheap humor and stupid gadgets like the other Bond movie's.
0553584537|5.0|Bobby Dodge is a Massachusetts State Trooper and has been a member of the STOP team for six years. A position in which he is called to duty as a sniper/observer an average of three times a month. He has never had to fire a weapon in the line of duty and has become accustomed to hostage and standoff situations being resolved peacefully.<br /><br />Jimmy Gagnon has his wife Catherine and his four year old son Nathan held hostage at gunpoint. Bobby is observing from across the street with his sniper rifle at the ready. When he sees the look of murder on Jimmy's face he is forced to do what he has always hoped that he would never have to do. Take a life to save a life. Bobby does not know the identity of the people involved, but he takes a certain amount of comfort in the knowledge that he has done his duty.<br /><br />The shooting becomes a high profile case when it is revealed that Jimmy Gagnon was the son of a Superior Court Judge. An instantaneous act in the line of duty triggers a chain of events with many questions unanswered. Was it an act of domestic abuse that got out of hand, or was it something more sinister? Could it have been a brilliantly engineered act of murder? These questions and many more arise as the subsequent events destroy lives and reach to the level of the judge's office.<br /><br />I was introduced to the work of Lisa Gardner last month when I read Hide which is the sequel to Alone. These two stories each stand on their own but would be better if read in sequence. Alone is masterfully written and ties many of the events in Hide together. This one is equally spellbinding and in the end leaves just enough questions unanswered to let you draw some of your own conclusions without leaving you feeling empty.<br /><br />Reading this one confirmed what I suspected after reading Hide and that is that Lisa Gardner has the gift to tell stories that will captivate readers. I will be anxiously awaiting her next masterpiece.
0891416811|5.0|Still stands the test of time as a true World War 2 classic! No glamour, just gritty and truthful experiences from an 18 year old who jumped into Hell and lived to tell about it. <br />This book has been understandably used as source material for other World War 2 books. A must have for any library!
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I must say i am impressed.  I thought this Johnny Cash dude was some rebel, troublemake, and a man in black that has bad intentions.  To look within this movie is to look within a man that I would of never guess him to be.  How through all the trouble he went through he survived.  \\"You're saying I don't believe in God?\\"  Didn't even know he did Gospel tunes! Johnny story is a great story of survival.  I even bought Gospel Road by Johnny Cash.  I must say that this is a man that I wasn't expecting.  He has great character and inspiring intentions.  Joaquin Phoenix did a great job! Reese, also a great job!  This movie is awesome all around!!!  Hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for anyone, not just kids, although it is one of my daughter's favorites.  I know some reviews have recommended it for kids over 12, but she got it when she was 2 and has never been frightened by it.  She actually really likes the no-face monster! <br /> <br />This movie really brings you into this remarkably detailed spirit world and you are loathe to let go at the end--I'm here hoping for a sequel--not just because of the engrossing story, but because Miyazki always manages to make such strong, intelligent female leads in his movies, and it works as a perfect counterbalance to the \\"let the prince do it for you\\" brand of movie girls traditionally are stuck with. <br /> <br />Chihiro is a little sister doing it for herself, and telling a remarkable story at the same time.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|First of all, I thought it was kind of cheesy and how it was just not much as what I expected.  I will say at the end with all the masks. \\"cool part!\\"  Although, i will buy it in HD DVD format but I think it's a movie that will grow on you if watched more than once. . . or twice. . . for that reason I just think that it felt like Zorro meets Revolutionist meets Batman Gotham City.  It had its moment but I thought the Natalie Portman character was kind of stupid, and I like Natalie. . . but oh well......  Should Rent it and atleast give this movie a try.  I'm buying it lol with just 3 stars but thats because i'm builting an HD DVD Collections and think this movie would look great!!! But if i hated the movie lol . . . forget HD lol rather buy Muppet Show HD DVD than this, but it wasn't BAD!!!
B00004YA0T|4.0|The other complete set of Eugen Jochum conducting Bruckner's symphonies, of course, is the series he recorded for DG in stereo between 1958 and 1967 with the Bavarian RSO or (in Symphonies 1, 4, and 7-9) the Berlin Philharmonic, following a number of recordings of individual symphonies he made in the pre-LP days. Although Jochum's basic conceptions remained consistent over the years, that earlier set finds Jochum more consistently alert and a shade more vibrant than in this valedictory go-round with the canonical Bruckner symphonies, taped in the late 1970s. By comparison, the overall impression here is of slightly lower voltage, although the flip side is that this cycle is also just that much more serene, and aptly so (Bruckner's music has been described as \\"blazing calm\\").<br /><br />Even so, this boxed set has a lot to recommend it, whether or not in preference to the DG cycle. There is the burnished and responsive delivery of the great Dresden orchestra, perhaps the oldest in Europe. There is EMI's warm and atmospheric sound, which in this remastering is considerably better focused and more detailed than in the first CD incarnation of this cycle. This cycle's Seventh and Ninth Symphonies arguably make a deeper impression than their counterparts in the DG series--even if the DG cycle compensates with more successful readings of the Fourth and Eighth. Above all, there is Jochum's lifelong identification with Bruckner's music (but NOT, as another reviewer suggested, due to a personal relationship between the conductor and the composer, who had died six years before Jochum was born!). Personal preference will dictate whether you go for the DG or EMI cycle; either way, you will hear Bruckner via one of the last exponents of a more flexible, less \\"monumental\\" (and also less stolid) approach to this composer's music.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|When you looking at the barrel of a gun, what's the difference?  This movie was what I wasn't expecting.  I thought great, Donnie Brasco type of a movie where FBI goes undercover and blah blah blah.  Fuggittaboutitt!! Well, i can't forget about this movie!  Leo was great! Jack seems to always be great!  Mark W. was good as well as Matt Damon.  I thought for sure with all these good actors that the story script would get lost.  I kept thinking to myself, \\"This is a good good good movie!!\\"  In a way, everyone saw the barrel, and it was no difference between good or evil.  Cops or Robbers.  I recommend this movie just for the mere thought of entertainment with all these good actors.  I wasn't disappointed and I thought for sure i was going to be!
0385336691|4.0|After having read some really lame so called thrillers, i was beginning to wonder if anybody knew how to write them.  <br />So I went back to old faithful, and grabbed The Hard Way. I knew Lee Child would not let me down. He didn't. <br /> <br />I still feel One Shot is he best reacher book so far, but this one was worthy of the series.  <br />Reacher is never really in trouble, nor do you ever feel his life is on the line. Sometimes it can get bogged down in too much details, especially about the surroundings.  <br />But it was a hgood action read.
B000ICM5VW|4.0|This movie is good.... The people on the island were more interesting than anything.  King Kong did look cool and a little sense of sadness with his face expression and everything.  I bought the HD DVD because they said this movie was amazing on it!  Well, I must say that this HD DVD rocks!  The clarity and clearness of the picture. Uhm, wow! The color of the pictures so alive! Uhm, wow! Even lol Jack Black look pretty good on HD.  Uhm, another wow is the Actors.  If you love the movie KING KONG, but the HD, you won't be disappointed.  Can we be honest for a moment?  I dont even care for the movie, but HD is AWESOME when it comes to the Big Black Kong of this movie! BUY IT! Atleast just for the HD!  I give HIGH props for the picture of the Definition of this movie!
B000OY8NII|5.0|As someone stated earlier the Sci-Fi channel over the last few years have been trying to bolster its viewership with original shows. Well \\"Eureka\\" is arguably the best of the bunch. The show is definately an original and is a refreshing storyline compared to the same old Science Fiction story.<br /><br />First of all, the actors and actresses in this show are phenomenal. The leading character, Sheriff Jack Carter, is played by Colin Ferguson an outstanding actor. Another actor that I would like to mention by name is Joe Morton, who plays the resident genius / car garage owner by the name of Henry Deacon. Each week presents a different problem and Deacon is usually in the middle of it. Morton has to be one of the best and most underrated actors on prime time TV. He has played on every prime time show imaginable from CSI: NY and the original Law & Order to the X-Files (episode 1, 2000).<br /><br />Secondly, if you watch shows because of beautiful women, then this is the show for you. Eureka has three of the most beautiful women on primetime TV.<br /><br />  Allison Blake is a co-star played by Salli Richardson-Whitfield. Salli plays an agent of the federal govt. who acts as the liaison between the federal govt. and Eureka. She is smart, professional, and a goddess.<br /><br />  Then there is Beverly Barlowe played by Debrah Farentino. Beverly is the town therapist / Inn owner who is also some kind of secret agent. Her sex appeal seeps from the TV. Its unbelievable that she is not a bigger star than she is.<br /><br />  Last there is Deputy Jo Lupo played by actress Erica Cerra. Jo is Jack Carter's Gung Ho Deputy who thinks she is the next Dirty Harry. She is a little Tom Boy-ish, but even that can't hide her beauty.<br /><br />The layout and the setting of this show is great. It has just the right amount of fresh new ideas mixed with some traditional themes of TV. For instance there is a \\"thing\\"  between Carter and Blake that somewhat remind me of \\"Who's The Boss\\"<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best shows on night time TV, both cable and major networks. If you missed the first season, order it now watch it, and be prepared for season 2.nd me of \\"Who's The Boss\\" <br /> <br />Overall this is one of the best shows on night time TV, both cable and major networks. If you missed the first season, order it now watch it, and be prepared for season 2.
B000GTJT0W|3.0|This movie wasn't that bad even with 3 stars.  I like Matthew (especially in TIME TO KILL) and Penelope is ok, attractive but her acting wasn't the best (kinda like her in Gothika even though it was a short role), but then again overall it was a comedy action movie.  William H Macy, i like his funny parts in other movies as well.  I bought this on HD and can't wait to watch it!!  The bad guy wasn't convincing, and the storyline was not bad, but as for an overall movie, I would recommend it if say they like Indiana Jones, or some thrill ride. . . .  It's a good movie, and I'm glad to purchase it for my HD DVD COLLECTIONS!  Atleast RENT THIS for a relaxing night!

B00005JPGO|4.0|Leo, Leo, Leo!  Beside being the sign of my Month, this a name of a brilliant actor in this movie.  He did one of the best job in his career. (Whats eating Gilbert)  I couldn't believe the acting of Leo and Djimon Hounsou.  Outstanding!  How Leo wanted that Diamond and how Djimon wanted his diamond (kid).  Both at all cost were doing everything they could within themselve to get what they wanted.  At times, both needed each other in some way to help them achieve what goal they had.  That was finding Djimon's kid and Leo's diamond.  I will say I was naive and didn't know the great extent to what goes through searching for diamonds.  After seeing this film, I can't believe how many blood was spill for small rocks that are worth to many.  It was a sad movie, but it had a great message of the \\"truth\\" coming out of this whole entire business that many lives were lost at the cost of what?  Humans that really couldn't defend themselve. Recommend everyone to watch this!  Love this Movie!
B000JIHP88|5.0|As a new mom I was looking for something that would hold my daughter's interest.My 1 month old daughter loves this mobile. We put it on her crib & she slept there the entire night without a fuss. The night light is just right to soothe & the sound level is perfect. During the day, I get my work done with her totally occupied with the bright colours & \\"jungle\\" sounds. Easy to assemble & great price...couldn't ask for better. My only problem with it, are the batteries..it eats them up, solved that problem by using recharables. <br />All in all, one fantastic mobile.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I must say with the deepest warmth about this movie.  I thought it was going to be corny.  A real father and his son portraying in a movie about a father and son movie.  Above all, Will Smith.  Now, I remember him when Parents just didn't Understand.  But he won me over easily.  I felt his struggle.  Just when I think he would come out of it, something else happens.  It was like Keep kicking him when he's already down.  I thought Will Smith did a great and inspiring job.  His son was good, but Will Smith did an amazing job.  Hats off!! Great motivation piece of film with a message of never give up, by all means.
B0002SG1OY|5.0|If you are viewing this item right now you probably already know about the significance of this album. I have owned the old domestic Reprise edition for years now and just recently picked up this pressing. The sound quality is superior and the booklet is handsome and much more informative. You will not regret buying this import in lieu of the older, more common Reprise pressing.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I just had the opportunity to see Muse live, (touring with My Chemical Romance.)  Muse, can play!!!! Really impressive Live, and so is this CD.  I personally think it's their best, and... I just wanted to put my five stars in here for them.  They deserve 'em.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|Being a big Blind Guardian fan, I have to say any Blind Guardian fan owes it to the band to buy this dvd. If you've been to a Blind Guardian concert, the memories will come rushing back. If you haven't, you'll see how much the band touches the crowd. The dvd is put together well and the picture and audio quality is great. There is nothing to complain about the set-list. They cover pretty much what the audience wants to hear. I really really wish they included Born in a Mourning Hall though. That song is just amazing and that's about the only thing lacking from the list. They were generous enough to include four bonus tracks on the 2nd dvd, so that's a plus. The only complaint I have is that the extras seem a bit lacking. I think they could've done a better job of putting together a better extras disc. However, the dvd is worth buying for the concert alone. Do yourself a favor and buy this dvd and sing along with the Bard's song. <br /> <br />*sings* Now you all know... Bard's and their songs...
B000002INR|5.0|I saw them live last year and I loved it. Don't laugh at me, you know you still know all the words. Wear your music proudly. Laugh at those ninnies in line to see Taylor Hicks, but not at my love of Skid Row.
B000E1155E|5.0|Brilliant: Yes. Overhyped: Maybe. The debut from the latest british indie rockers to drop in the states, was hyped by the uk press so much that people nearly hated these guys before even taking a listen. I was one that was kind of put off by mags like NME that would not shut up about them even before their first album was close to being released. But I've got to say...I was proven oh so wrong. The lead single \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\" serves up a pretty generic, straight-forward approach at getting the scenesters involved. However, this album really shines with the smashing first track \\"The View From The Afternoon\\" and from there the album never lets up...delivering blow after blow. This album, top to bottom, is one of the best of 2006. Give them a chance...you don't know what you're missing. Tracks of interest include; \\"The View From The Afternoon\\", \\"Fake Tales Of San Francisco\\", \\"Mardy Bum\\", \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\", \\"A Certain Romance\\"
B00005JPPI|4.0|I love watching two people engaged in a mind game, with their subtle attempts at one-upping each other through carefully choreographed manipulation. The chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling in \\"Fracture\\" is tense, practically thick enough to cut with a knife; their characters play off of each other so well, both with personalities that are intense and restrained at the same time. How appropriate for a film about committing the perfect crime and trying like mad to catch the criminal. What makes this case especially interesting is that the criminal is, physically speaking, within reach. Legally speaking, well, that's another story; the crime was planned and executed with extreme precision, leaving virtually nothing for the legal system to work with.    This emphasis on craftiness and personal style made for quite an engrossing experience, made even better by a solid plot and decent performances. Hopkins plays engineer Ted Crawford, a man of considerable control with an eye for exactness (to understand what I mean, watch the scenes featuring his homemade marble contraption). Through discreet observation, he learns that his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), has been having an affair with Officer Rob Nunally (Billy Burke). As one might expect, this is far from acceptable in Crawford's eyes; what's not so expected is how far he'll go in expressing his anger. To show her who's actually in control, he meets her at home and shoots her in the head.    Thus begins a seemingly never-ending Cat and Mouse game. Unaware that the crime scene is his lover's home, Nunally arrives to negotiate with Crawford. To everyone's surprise, Crawford confesses, despite the fact that the spent shell casings were wiped clean and that he had already burned his clothing. After being arrested (and physically assaulted by Nunally), it's one legal snag after another: forensic testing concluded that Crawford's gun had never been fired; there were no fingerprints anywhere; Nunally's testimony is useless when his infidelity is made public; Crawford's confession is inadmissible because he was supposedly provoked into giving one. All the cards seem to be stacked in Crawford's favor, and because of that, he decides to represent himself during trial.    Here enters Willy Beachum (Gosling), a young Assistant DA assigned as the Prosecution Attorney. There's a quiet desperation about this character; he ambitiously aims for the private sector, which makes the pressure to succeed even greater. One gets the sense that his continuous facial ticks and hand movements are the direct result of his overachievement. He's more flawed than one might be led to believe, especially in his determination to win every case (having a ninety-seven percent success rate sure looks good on a resume). Crawford, being the sly devil he is, picks up on Beachum's personality quirks immediately. This paves the way for a series of conversations that are nothing more than puppetry; Crawford has complete control of both his situation and Beachum. This character is arrogant at a level that's both fascinating and deplorable; continuously being called \\"Old Sport\\" is enough to drive anyone over the edge.    As the film progresses, a series of legal technicalities bring Crawford closer to acquittal. How disappointing for Beachum, who knows--but cannot prove--that Crawford is as guilty as sin. Of course, Crawford knows that Beachum knows, which is why he takes so much pleasure in watching the young attorney fail. If Beachum hopes to get anywhere with the case, he has to produce some evidence, namely the gun that Crawford actually used. But every time the crime scene is searched, nothing is found. Desperate to see his lover's husband get convicted, Nunally tries to convince Beachum to enter false evidence. I won't say whether or not Beachum cracks (pardon the pun); I will say that the odds against him are staggeringly high, meaning he has next to no options left.    What I enjoyed most about thisfilm was it's careful attention to character. No one was flat or underdeveloped; just enough is given for the audience to feel emotionally invested. This is especially important for a subplot involving Beachum's relationship with his new boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike). They initially walk on eggshells around each other, the sexual tension overwhelming. When they finally sleep together, I never got the sense that it was an inappropriate inter-office fling. It felt more like a cry for release, each consumed by worlds that are crashing down around them. It's an effective counterpoint to Crawford's manipulative streak; it affects Beachum so strongly, and it seems that there's nothing that can be done.    Just as strong is the tightly wound nature of the film. \\"Fracture\\" is an above average thriller, toying with the audience with a maddening sense uncertainty. Is there a way for Crawford to be caught? Has he, in fact, committed the perfect crime? I leave it to you to find out.
B000055ZB8|5.0|This is a review for the special edition version. <br /> <br />In the world of horror movies, I always thought that vampires were more silly than scary:  Romantic people who like blood and who make corny remarks like \\"I want to suck your blood\\".  Entertaining? Maybe.  Scary? No. <br /> <br />Then I saw Nosferatu. <br /> <br />What a creepy vampire movie!  There are some scenes that could have come from my nightmares.  I'll admit that this movie technically didn't scare me (I'm a 23 years old, afterall) but it did get under my skin.  It features what has to be the most ruthless, inhuman version of the blood-sucker ever!  By the end of the movie I didn't think it was possible for the actor playing the undead creature to actually be human. <br /> <br />It's an awesome movie to watch every Halloween.  Get it before the clock strikes midnight!
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is perhaps one of the most recognizable anti-war novels. I had blushingly never read this one before. It's one of Megan's favorite books, and she's tried to get me to read it for years. And now I have, and I'm so glad that I have. <br /> <br />Slaughterhouse-Five is Kurt Vonnegut's satirical tale of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who is \\"unstuck in time.\\" What this means is that Pilgrim often disconnects from the present and picks up again at some other time in his life and usually at a different location. Pilgrim was in Dresden during the bombings, he was in Nazi concentration camps, he was at home with his wife, visiting with his recently married daughter, visiting with his son who was a green beret, being abducted by aliens and taken to the planet, Tralfamador, where he is put on display at a zoo. <br /> <br />I found this book to be quite powerful. It's a touching story at times, very light-hearted and almost humorous at times, and at other times just disturbing. It's a story that will always remain relevant in these days of war. It shows how powerful of a thing war is and the traumatic toll that it can have on the life of a soldier. <br /> <br />Vonnegut's writing style is amazing. I found myself asking \\"what makes a book a classic?\\" This book is the perfect example of a classic. It's a writing style that's totally in a league of it's own. The book flows so easily, yet there's so many complex connections made in it. Little tiny lines that stand out at first come back in a major way later in the book tying into the main plot. Vonnegut was a master of the American novel. <br />
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Never have I been so moved by a series to exclaim in wonder and actually shed tears of joy at the beauty that surrounds us on this wonderful planet.<br /><br />I have been watching it on Discovery HD Theater when it premiered in March. The first episode \\"Pole to Pole\\" set the tone by showing the range of life and species that exist on this planet. The subsequent episodes delve into the habitats one by one. Mountains, Fresh Water, Caves, Deserts, Ice Worlds, Great Plains, Jungles, Shallow Seas, Seasonal Forests and Deep Ocean are the subsequent episodes. This is one series that has to be seen to be believed of what the intrepid cameramen of BBC/Discovery Channel have been able to capture through their sheer perseverance in remote locations. The HD technology has captured some scenes and images never seen before and some seen before but never with this clarity and beauty. 5 years, 62 countries and 204 locations is what it took to make this series, and the result is a lifetime TV series.<br /><br />This is one series that fascinated my kid as much as it amazed me. She wanted to watch her cartoons but the moment the episode began she was captivated. Both of us  shared together the wonder that is our Planet and it was she who brought up the subject of what we might be doing to it by our actions. We cried when we saw how polar bears have begun to drown as ice melts faster every year. The image of one lone bear trying to walk on ice but falling into the slushy waters, and having to swim longer distances to capture food and finally dying with exhaustion was heart breaking. The series makes no references to the present conditions, just in passing as with the polar bear. I think the directors and producers of the series just wanted to show us the beauty of the natural world, the fight for survival of several animals even when there is no climactic change. And as we keep watching and are filled with awe and wonderment that we're lucky enough to live on this planet, we begin to appreciate quietly in our hearts how we need to change today to ensure that we save our planet.<br /><br />That is what my daughter felt on her own, she asked me why we were not doing more to save our natural world and I did not have any good answers. The last 3 episodes, Planet Earth: The Future delve deeper into these issues, which I haven't had a chance to see yet.<br /><br />I watched a clip of David Attenborough's version video on the web before I started watching the series with Sigourney Weaver's narration, and I was disappointed by her blandness and lack of depth. I bought this set like many others to listen to Sir David's narration. I was torn between the regular DVD set and the HD DVD though. This series is good enough to make me buy an HD DVD player just to be able to watch it in its true form! However, the regular set has the Future series and the Planet Earth diaries which the HD set does not have. I loved the Planet Earth Diaries (or behind the scenes) with cameramen, it made a fascinating documentary on it's own, and wished some were longer. If they had the extra material in the HD DVD set, it would have been my first choice.<br /><br />I had saved the Discovery HD Theatre epidodes on my HD Cable box and I was able to compare their image quality with this Standard DVD version playing on an upconverting DVD player. The Discovery Theater images were crystal clear, and you could literally see each grain of sand on the sea bed or each crevice on a rock face. The Standard DVD looked pretty good when upconverted to 720p and if I had not seen the HD version I would have been quite amazed with the image quality. Right now I've been spoilt by the Discovery Theater version. If you're considering the HD version  it's a great choice if you have an HD DVD/BluRay player. You'll probably not see a better HD disc. This series was shot completely in HD format. From my experience in the media industry I can tell you that this is a very, very expensive format to shootin especially given the 5 years that it took to make this series. Most television is shot in a regular digital format and then upconverted to the HD format later. That gives great images but they cannot compare to something shot totally in HD. That is the reason the image quality of this series is spectacular. In HD they were able to capture the action which when replayed in slow-motion also stays crystal clear. Therefore you have breathtaking images of a shark capturing its prey (and many others) in slo-mo.<br /><br />This really is the set to buy. It's like a living documentation of the beauty of our earth, some of which was starting to disappear right as the cameras were rolling. Perhaps, that is why BBC and Discovery spared no cost to produce this series and it is a masterpiece.t it took to make this series.

1572815108|5.0|This smaller Thoth deck is the only one I use for readings - and it's excellent.  The colours are great and the artwork is of course legendary.  You should put the extra Magus cards aside and only use the standard one, as the others are supposedly designs rejected by Crowley, so they are really just curiosities (according to expert Hajo Banzhaf).  I have the larger deck too but I would find it a bit too unwieldy for shuffling. <br /> <br />The best book to help with divinations for beginners is Banzhaf's \\"Keywords for the Crowley Tarot\\" which explains the symbolism of each card and shows what the cards mean in different situations - general, work, consciousness and love - plus it includes some great spreads.
B0000025DV|5.0|This is with out a doubt the crowning jewel in the career of E.L.O. !! The whole album is absolutly amazing!! Try listening from track eight to track 15, over and over again and see if you can see what Jeff Lynne and the band are doing there, just awesome, absolutly awesome!! It's too bad E.L.O. did not follow up on `Out of the Blue' in a similar fashion on the next collection of songs in this amazing concept of a rock'n roll/classical band! If you haven't heard it, I challenage everyone to try it!!!
B000LE1GVW|4.0|I'd heard the live performance of New Shoes and it blew me away. Of course, I Googled the song and his name and this 19 year old guy from Scotland popped up. Needless to say my jaw dropped. Listening to the live version of new shoes anyone would guess that he's a 60 year old Delta blues man. <br /> <br />Of course I ran out and bought the cd. However, on cd his voice is much smoother but great never the less. There are some great songs on this cd. Listening to them it really makes us remember that he is only 19 as his slow songs are so sweet without bitter and his upbeat songs are fun.  <br /> <br />This guy is a true musician. <br />
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Get this album simply because you're a fan of hip-hop, you're a fan of Dilla. Been a fan through the goods and the bads. I can't say much about it because it speaks for itself. It's a classic instrumental album. You don't get much of that anymore.
B00004TH6O|5.0|The music of Queens of the Stone Age is characterized by various labels:  stoner rock, alt metal, punk metal, or simply hard rock or heavy metal.  Of all these generally unhelpful labels I think \\"heavy metal\\" may be the least helpful.  It is hard to see anything these guys have in common with Motley Crue or Judas Priest.  Metallica isn't so far off, but the bands they most resemble would be some of the Pacific Northwest grunge bands like Screaming Trees or Soundgarden.  It is definitely hard rock, but I'm not sure that Queens of the Stone Age is served very well by labels.  I prefer to think of them as a hard rock band that has cross over appeal to a host of fans who would never dream of listening to metal, while still appealing to metal fans as well.  Certainly they have achieved a critical respect that no metal bands manage to garner.  Even the snootiest fan of Indie rock will listen to them along with Yo La Tenga and Big Star.  What is the secret of their abilities to cut across genres and appeal to an unusually wide range of music fans?  I think the key is their own strong sense of musicality coupled with an aversion to any kind of posing or theatricality that would code them as belonging to any particular subgroup.  Faith No More attempted to have some crossover appeal, but their deliberate poses limited how far this was going to take place.<br /><br />No matter how you label it, this is great music.  Hard rock though it may be, every song is brimming with great hooks and a number of splendid musical ideas.  The band is often so ironic that one can miss the irony, such as their semi-hit \\"The Feel Good Hit of the Summer,\\" which sounds like a Beach Boys title but has verses that merely repeat \\"Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, Marijuana, Ecstasy and Alcohol\\" over and over to a chorus that does the same to \\"Cocaine.\\"  The point is less to advocate the use of drugs than to make a cheap--but funny--score off the title.<br /><br />\\"The Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" could make it sound like the band focuses on gimmick songs, but that is hardly the case.  \\"Feel Good Hit\\" opens the disc, but all the rest of the songs are well-arranged, clever, and brimming with musical ideas.  Some have so many things going on at once that the genius lies in the fact that they neither overwhelm one another nor lessen the musical impact of the album as a whole.  Mark Lanegan and Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees appear on several tracks and in fact RATED R does sound like a Screaming Trees album with a denser guitar sound and less psychedelia.  There really are no weak cuts on the album or even many that are appreciably than anything else on the disc.  I've asked a few friends who know the album to name their three favorite cuts and I've been amazed to see everyone come back with different choices, sometimes not citing any of the songs others or I liked most.  For the record, my three faves are \\"Lost Art of Keeping a Secret,\\" \\"Auto Pilot,\\" and \\"Better Living Through Chemistry,\\" though on another day either \\"Monsters in the Parasol\\" or \\"Leg of Lamb.\\"  The omission of \\"The Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" doesn't mean I don't like the song; I do.  But I find the lyrics pretty dull and I think the song lacks the musical diversity found in almost any other song on the album.<br /><br />This could well be the hard rock album from the past decade with the closest thing you will find to near universal appeal.  Some people who listen to nothing but very light rock won't care for it, but it you have a good ear and enjoy great music regardless of what genre it is in, this is an album every serious lover of music should own.make it sound like the band focuses on gimmick songs, but that is hardly the case.  \\"Feel Good Hit\\" opens the disc, but all the rest of the songs are well-arranged, clever, and brimming with musical ideas.

B00000I8UK|5.0|This was the last great studio album Dolphy was to record before his early death months later in Berlin in June of 1964. Some of his best works on bass clarinet and flute are found on here, including \\"Hat and Beard\\" and \\"Gazzelloni\\". Dolphy's bass clarinet skills are typically in the middle range and his phrasing and tonality are just amazing. Freddie Hubbard (t), who played on Dolphy's 1960 \\"Outward Bound\\" album returns on here to add his expertise. Richard Davis (b), who played on the 1961 \\"At the Five Spot\\" and 1963's \\"Music Matador\\", is also present on this date. Bobby Hutcherson (vibes) and Anthony Williams (d) were both new to Blue Note, and their presence on this album assured their longevity with the label. Considered by many fans and critics as the highpoint of Dolphy's career, \\"Out to Lunch\\" is certain to bring more fans flocking to Dolphy's work for years to come.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a simple flash that just fills a need for somebody who wants better results than the built-in flash of a Nikon dSLR camera without extra complexity. It does what it does, and quite well. <br /> <br />The only controls on the unit itself is a on/off switch and a bounce angle. The camera's iTTL function does the work, and I have no complaints about the results. Just a perfect solution to get a softer, more diffused lighting for indoor photography by allowing you to bounce the light rather than direct illumination. The body is quite compact, and when mounted to my D80 body does not throw off the balance in my hands. It even is compact enough to fit inside of some camera cases while still attached to the body. <br /> <br />It is also versatile in that you can improvise a bounce-diffuser for low-cost. Just cut a piece of 4x6 inkjet photo print paper to the same width of the flash, fold it in a \\"L\\" shape and mount it to the flash with a rubber band above and just behind the strobe. When the flash is pointed up to bounce, some of the light gets reflected forward by the paper behind the light and fills the subject a little better. Does the same as $40+ aftermarket reflector/diffusers. <br /> <br />The SB-400 by no means will do the same job as a SB-800, because that flash is made to give more options for the professional in more demanding situations. But for somebody wanting a flash for simple indoor photography (perhaps not a large public hall) where there is a desire to bounce the flash for better photos, or shoot from a little bit longer range, this does the job for not a great deal of money. <br /> <br />It would be better if the light could swivel as well as be angled upward for more bounce options. If that's important to you, then the SB-600 or SB-800 might be the right choice.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I went into my viewing of 'The Departed' with more than a bit of cynicism.  Having seen the film 'The Departed' was based upon - the Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' - I was prepared to take a snobbish view that the original was far superior.  Adding to my skepticism was a neat little line I read in the press to the effect that Hollywood had just bestowed upon Martin Scorsese its Best Picture prize for what is, by most opinions, approximately Mr. Scorsese's sixth-best film.  [For instance, 'The Departed' could be the second-coming of the 'The Godfather' and in no way could it surpass the brilliance of Scorsese's 'Goodfellas.'  I hope there's more than a few voters now kicking themselves for casting their votes on 'Dances With Wolves' - a film that hasn't aged well at all, especially given Costner's post-Wolves car wreck of a career vs. Scorsese's decades-long brilliance.]<br /><br />Anyway, surprise, surprise:  'The Departed' is brilliant on its own merits.  It borrows from - but does not copy exactly - Alan Mak and Felix Chong's original conception.  The three things that make the 'The Departed' succeed are:<br /><br />1. Scorsese's uncompromising vision - 'Infernal Affairs' featured some some pulled punches: a fateful fall from a building ends with a bloodless, almost artful landing on a car roof; and the ending seems to have been crafted with a sequel in mind (and, indeed, 'Infernal Affairs' spawned a profitable trilogy).  No such pullback from Scorsese: the same fateful fall results in a shocking splatter of blood; and the film's brutal denouement - which ends quite differently from the original - lays waste to any possibility of a sequel.<br /><br />2. William Monahan's brilliant adaptation - His script mashes up the Mak/Chong 'Affairs' tale with elements of 'The Brothers Bulger.'  The result is a hand-in-glove fit for its Boston setting.  And, as a native Bostonian, I found most of the accents spot-on, led by locals Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon.<br /><br />3. The Damon/DiCaprio/Wahlberg triumvirate - These three guys are outstanding.  Damon continues to choose great roles and perform brilliantly in them.  He's the key to the film, having to sell the covert version himself both to his police superiors and the movie audience.  He goes for the full-out, Southie-bred Bostonian here.  It's an awesome portrayal.  For those who think that's not acting, compare him here vs. takes on Jason Bourne and Tom Ripley.  This guy is a force.  DiCaprio is his equal here, but the surprise here is Wahlberg.  His role simply didn't exist in 'Affairs.' It's a relatively small part, but Wahlberg completely steals every single second he's on the screen.  He deserved that Oscar nomination./> <br />3.

B000H305U0|4.0|This is a Cd that suprised me. I am not usually a Justin Timbelake fan. I wasn't greatly impressed with InSinc and wasn't greatly impressed by the work that Justin Timberlake produced after his Insinc Days, but I heard \\"what goes around\\" on the radio , didn't know who sang it and was suprised to learn that the artist was Justin. I had to have the CD. I never thought I would be writing a review praising Justin Timberlake, but I am. This is a nice CD. I greatly enjoy \\"what goes around\\", the words of \\"losing my way\\" make me think about my own way. There is a lot to like in this compilation. I also like the hip hop sound of \\"sexy ladies\\". \\"Loved Stone\\" has a really nice beat. If you have preconceptions about Justin Timberlake, do yourself a favor and listen to this CD. It might suprise you as well.
B00006L3S3|5.0|Wow!  Wait until you hear this remixed and remastered Mind Games CD.  You will not believe your ears.  Mind Games was always a favorite Lennon album for me, even on vinyl.  But I always felt some of the tracks sounded \\"muffled\\", especially \\"Mind Games\\" and the classic rocker, \\"Meat City\\". Well, crank up your stereos!! Now all these wonderful tracks sound crisp, clear and loud.  You hear instruments and vocals that were lost in the original mixes - they were there all along, we just could not distinquish or seperate.  Now the songs are full of wonderful sounds and harmonies - and in real stereo.  I went back to the orignal CD issue to compare, and indeed many of the tracks sound like they were recorded in mono the seperation was so poor and volume so low. <br /> <br />This is a great Lennon CD and Peter Cobbin (Re-mix Engineer) at Abbey Road Studios has worked his magic once again (he also re-mixed the Plastic Ono Band and Imagine CD's).  Just Fabulous!

As a result, people have lost hope and have turned violent.  Suddenly, a pregnant woman capable of producing life appears out of nowhere and the chase is on... <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing wonderful), the plot is quite interesting, while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.  <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here. <br />

B00E9PMMPI|3.0|OK, before anyone starts the attack, let me tell you the movie itself gets 5 stars from this old-time sci-fi fan.  I've been enjoying Fantastic Voyage since seeing it on \\"All Nite Movies\\" back in the 70's (back when we only got 3 channels and there were no VCR's yet).  I've bought the VHS tape, both DVD releases, and now the Blu-ray.  I'm a fan.  So this review is for folks who also like the movie, and are considering the upgrade to Blu-ray.  Also: I know there are some stubborn Blu-ray haters out there who refuse to see the value of the format.  I'm certainly not one of them.  I buy pretty much every classic science fiction film that gets the HD treatment.  And most of the time, the improvements are well worth the extra money.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to inform you that this isn't the case with Fantastic Voyage.  I've just done a back-to-back comparison with the [[ASIN:B000O78KWE Fantastic Voyage (Special Edition)]] DVD, and there isn't really much difference.  The overall look of the film isn't bad, but there are some areas that were in desperate need of restoration that have still not been corrected.  The most obvious example is a scene around the 1:07 mark where some of the characters are outside the ship attempting to make repairs.  The picture appears washed-out and very grainy.  I mean, we're talking VHS quality.  In fact, many of the scenes inside the human body, colorful though they are, have a similar affliction.  I'm no film restoration expert, but having seen what can be done with films like [[ASIN:B00AQ6J4XM The Blob (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]]--a film almost 10 years older and with probably 1/3 the budget of Fantastic Voyage--I can't help believe something more could be done here.<br /><br />Otherwise, the BD release repeats the extras from the previous DVD.  There's an entertaining and informative featurette, theatrical trailer and t.v. spots, plus two separate audio commentary tracks.  So if you already have the DVD, I honestly don't think it's worth upgrading.  However, if you like the film and don't already have it, you'll probably be very happy with the Blu-ray.  I think I probably would have passed on it, had I known there were no significant improvements.hink it's worth upgrading.

0385512058|4.0|For someone who hates networking this book makes you think about networking in a different way. You need to go out there and just let people know what you do, who you know, who you want to know, etc. Go out there and make a phone call, ask them to lunch and you never know how they can help you. I am still thinking about this book a year after a read the book. Worth reading
B00006CXSS|5.0|I saw bits and pieces of this when it originally aired on HBO and knew thatI had to see the whole series.  I have watched it completely 3 times now and I am sure that I will see it a dozen times more.  The cinematography (spell check), sound, music, acting, and special effects were of superior quality.  If you enjoyed the work that Spielberg and Hanks had done with Saving Private Ryan then you will not be disappointed at all with this series.  Any history buff would come to appreciate it and those that watch it will have a better understanding of the sacrafices these men took when duty called.
B00005ABKC|5.0|HARD PROMISES is yet another masterpiece by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, featuring such great FM standards as \\"The Waiting\\" and \\"A Woman In Love (And It's Not Me)\\", as well as such forgotten gems as \\"Letting You Go\\" and \\"King's Road.\\" This CD features great remastering, greatly emphasizing a style whose inflences run the gamut from the Allman Brothers And The Outlaws to the Eagles and the Steve Miller Band to Springsteen, Seger, and the Band. Petty's advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes HARD PROMISES an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you like Pink Floyd you HAVE to buy the DVD.  I couldn't get it fast enough when I first heard about it.  Got a great deal through Amazon.com.  I have to tell you, the second disk is Dark Side of the Moon, complete, with 4 songs in the encore.  When they played Uncomfortably Numb everyone in the room with me stood up and hollered and clapped hands.  It was that intense.  By far, the absolutely best rock, guitar, crescendo, I've ever seen/heard.  I only ever saw them live in 1975, in Washington DC.  I never did get to a modern show with all of the laser stuff.  We played the music through the stereo as the DVD played over the TV.  It was a blast.  I only wish I had a great surround sound system for my TV.  Now listen, don't go right to Uncomfortably Numb (Although I do now every time).  You must start from the beggining and go to the end in one sitting/standing.  Do the show and it will do you.  Enjoy.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Please. If you are one of the many who have seen this movie and thought, \\"this is simply a political tactic. Al Gore just wants to get re-elected. Besides, global warming doesn't exist!\\" Then THINK AGAIN. Please. Please! Please, American people! Do not be so blind! Is this not like any other time in history when people doubted something because they were afraid of it? We MUST act now. Think, fellow Americans. THINK! Is this the time to act? No. The time to act came decades ago. But should we act, even when it seems the process is irreversible!? Absolutely. We must. Oh, and ladies and gentleman? For those of you who say, \\"Well, but Al Gore probably uses more electricity than I do with his big house....\\" HE MAKES UP FOR IT 1,000,000,000 TIMES OVER! Don't you see this man is changing the world!  <br /> <br />Do not be blind, do not be foolish. See the movie. Buy it, rent it, borrow it, it DOES NOT MATTER! But we must change the world. And forgive me for the seeming cliche, but the naivete of the American people, and of the world, about global warming is absolutely unacceptable. We are \\"humans.\\" Are we not? Aren't we supposed to be the \\"smartest species?\\" News flash, America. We are not. Do you see baby quail and dolphins polluting our rivers, destroying our farms, turning our rain to acid?  <br /> <br />America! Now is the time to act! Educate yourselves! ALL SCIENTISTS AGREE that global warming exists. Don't believe me? Why is it that the very textbooks of our children say so? (\\"Biology,\\" by Pearson Education, for example). <br /> <br />Enough is enough. We MUST CHANGE THE WORLD.
B000P5K6BS|1.0|From the description, I see that this is simply the Best Buy version of the B'Day Deluxe Edition. It doesn't have \\"2 bonus tracks\\" as it claims, it only has one. \\"World Wide Woman\\" is a hidden track after \\"Listen\\" on all the regular versions of the album, so it is not a bonus. The only real bonus track is \\"First Time,\\" which is the same song as \\"My First Time\\" from the bonus disc of Beyonce's Live At Wembley DVD. It's a b-side from her debut album. It was produced by The Neptunes, but it's really nothing special. <br /> <br />The album is excellent. It is my favorite album of all time. But the point of this review is there really is no point in buying this if you already have B'Day Deluxe Edition. And it's absolutely pointless if you have the DVD I previously mentioned.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I liked this movie. I wanted to see it on a big screen, maybe Imax, but waited too long. It was playing at the dollar movies, but I don't like going there, people have crying babies and make so much noise they spoil it. When it came out on DVD I went to the DVD store a million times asking for it, but all the copies were checked out. Finally I saw it and it did live up to and exceeded my expectations. It was awesome.<br /><br />Natalie Portman was great (do you suppose that's where Britney got the idea to shave her head?), and Hugo Weaving really conveyed a lot of emotion, even though he wore a mask throughout the entire film. It was cool when he was listening to Getz/Gilberto The Girl From Ipanema while scrambling eggs for Natalie in his Bachelor Pad/Bunker.<br /><br />I heard that the author of the graphic novel upon which it was based disowned the project, but like Bladerunner, it might have been a different story than what the author had in mind, but was a compelling cinematic vision in its own right.<br /><br />This movie worked as an action thriller, with just the right dose of irony, and then on another level altogher, it was a thought provoking film about politics, freedom, and the lack thereof.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu took 4 interlocking stories, unfolding in Mexico, the US, Japan, and Morocco, to make this film, but there is a communication breakdown, not unlike what happened to the builders of the tower of Babel. Though it had multiple nominations, and won for best score, the sum of the parts somehow equals less than the whole.<br /><br />The stories don't really connect in any meaningful way, and three out of four don't even work as vignettes. The young goat herders who shoot Cate Blanchett are not believable. Actually, they do a good job, acting-wise, but I just didn't buy that they wouldn't realize that if they shot at a busful of tourists, they might actually hit one.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's character is a real jerk, and perhaps was meant as a metaphor for our foreign policy. He is understandably frustrated in his attempts to get his wife to a hospital, but tells the other passengers on the bus that he will kill them if they leave without him. If he is meant to learn a lesson, such as the importance of family, he doesn't ever seem to get it. He is just relieved that his wife and children don't die. Brad Pitt did a good job, acting-wise, but the writing didn't give him much to work with. I never understood what exactly he was doing out in the desert, and what was the trouble in his marriage about? Why was he such a jerk? Why should we care?<br /><br />The Japanese story is the only one that can stand on its own, but its connection to the other stories is the weakest of all. A young Japanese woman struggles to connect though she is deaf, and saddened by the recent death of her mother. Rinko Kikuchi was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress (along with Adriana Barraza), and she really deserved it. Tokyo looks like an amazing place.<br /><br />This film was really a good effort, with great cinematography, an Oscar winning score, and fabulous locations. Acting was first rate, but what was it trying to say? I can think of three examples where this kind of format worked to much better effect: Crash, Traffic, and Syriana. These covered the themes of Race, Drugs, and Middle East Politics, respectively, but the interlocking stories supported and intensified each other. And the scenes from Babel in Mexico were great, but if you want to see the vibrancy and energy of Mexico portrayed, I recommend Et Tu Mama, Tambien.nk of three examples where this kind of format worked to much better effect: Crash, Traffic, and Syriana.

B000003S09|4.0|This is a powerful debut by a powerful group. The brutal opening tears your head off and as you listen to the frenetic solos and distorted vocals on \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" you might think to yourself, \\"What year was this recorded?\\" Suddenly, the album shifts gears into \\"I Talk To The Wind,\\" a folky, wistful but cynical reminder that you are in late-sixties counter-culture London. \\"Epitaph\\" is well done but a bit H-E-A-V-Y for a man of my tastes (I prefer the Moody Blues when I seek mellotron melodrama), but \\"Moonchild\\" makes a nice transition into surreal flowery hippiedom (for those who tire of the extened improv at the end, the \\"Frame By Frame\\" box set has an abridged version that may be the one featured in the film \\"Buffalo 66\\"). The album's closer, \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King,\\" is pure artrock - daddy to Genesis. The audio production and musical arrangements are superb. Great album.
B000063COX|4.0|The future kings of metals debut has some amazing songs. \\"Sanctuary\\", \\"Running Free\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Transylvania\\", and \\"Strange World\\" are all great songs. The guitars are good, with Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton trading licks, and the bass is good as it will always be (bow to Steve Harris). Vocalist Paul Di'Anno does great on the album as well. <br /> <br />This is a great album, however there is one problem, and it is the reason I gave the album 4 instead of 5 stars: The production is very muddled. Steve Harris (bassist & leader) himself doesn't think the album is as good as it could have be because of the production. They would get the production on the next album, however... <br /> <br />
B000003S0D|3.0|King Crimson's third album has obviously generated strong opinions on both sides of the chart, but I've said it before and I'll say it again: King Crimson records are some of the most well-produced and well-arranged albums ever made. Let me first cite some if the album's strengths. The production is an audiophiles wet dream - very expansive, textured, and panoramic. This cd sounds GREAT on a great stereo! K.C. always had great, jazz-oriented drummers and they were very well recorded. Tom toms, kick drum, and bass guitar have an especially deep ambience on \\"Lizard,\\" and mellotrons, guitars, and horns cut through this ambience with piercing sonic talons. The overall sound of the album is dynamic and creepy. Gordon Haskell's vocals are somewhat grotesque and ghoulish (this may be part of the reason so many people dislike this record) but they work very well with most of this material. The acoustic guitar playing on \\"Cirkus\\" is very very good, and \\"Happy Family\\" has a great jazz-rock feel. Unfortunately, the \\"concept\\" the album pursues fails to hold my attention for very long. I briefly wonder about the \\"meaning\\" of all the recurring themes, but the hypnotic instrumental passages don't have me wondering too long, and as side two carries on and on, I begin to think about what cd I will put on next. The trouble with the \\"concept album\\" is that if it's not a very defined concept and there isn't enough strong lyrical material that is graspable within a reasonable amount of time, the listener's mind begins to wander. It's very difficult to just pull one or two of the best songs out of context and enjoy them for their full value, but at the same time it's difficult to sit through this entire album on a regular basis. This is more of a musician's record. If you \\"produce\\" or \\"arrange\\" music, you should definately check this one out. If you came upon King Crimson because you are into Bowie and Eno, you might think this album is a bit too Dungeons & Dragons.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Exit drummer Clive Burr (who did a fantastic job on the 1st 3 records), enter Nicko McBrain. Now all the stars have been aligned. The greatest metal lineup of the 80's is now ready for business. This is the 1st of 4 (5 including Live After Death) albums from the Dickinson/Harris/Murray/Smith/McBrain lineup, and my God is it a good one. <br /> <br />Once again, basically every song is a highlight, with singles \\"Flight of Icarus\\" and \\"The Trooper\\" leading the show, and with the epic album closer \\"To Tame a Land\\" (based on the Sci-Fi book Dune, and I believe is one of Maiden's most underrated songs) ending the album on an awesome note. This is also the 1st Maiden album where singer Bruce Dickinson writes something on his own. \\"Revelations\\", Dickinson's 1st masterpiece, is a fantastic heavy-to-soft song which greatly helps the flow of the album. <br /> <br />Maiden are in full gallop here. They would continue to gallop on through the rest of the 80's after this one. <br /> <br />Stick around, people, the next one is even better...
B00064WSN2|4.0|The common complaint about this album is that it is an almost song-for-song clone of the band's debut, \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King.\\" To make things worse, the band has already begun to fragment and lineup changes had already begun before the disk was completed. However, this is still a great album. \\"Pictures Of A City\\" may not have the collective group feel of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" but it's just as agressive and has some excellent guitar work. \\"Cadence And Cascade\\" is just as pretty as \\"I Talk To The Wind,\\" and \\"Cat Food\\" has a great jazz-rock feel with wild piano work by Keith Tippet. Some songs even do better on this album than the debut's counterparts they are modelled after: I much prefer the title track over 1969's \\"Epitaph,\\" and \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is a nicer look at the band's improvisational style than the free form ending of \\"Moonchild.\\" The mellotron work on this album is very nice. King Crimson records are some of the most well-produced albums ever made and I can certainly recommend this one.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Avril Lavigne's back and better then ever. One has to keep in mind that she has a very independent but distinct and original pop rock sound. Her lyrics are still based around a lot of relationship and dating issues, but she delivers her words like no other rock star out there. Teaming up with the guitarist and drummer from Sum 41 was the best thing Lavigne could have done to aide in her evolution. Their take on rock and pop made this record what it is; an in your face pop rocker album that gets one moving to the beat. Avril's musicality is still fairly simple in the means of progressions, harmonies, and melodies. But her delivery and simplicity is what makes the record so catchy. She knows how to use accidentals and dynamics masterfully for the style she has stuck with over the years, and this album shows it. All that's really missing are killer guitar solos and licks, but I'm sure Avril will get there someday. The record's first single \\"Keep Holding On\\" not only shows her potential in that regard, but it was also the soundtrack theme for the 2006 fantasy film: Eragon.

B00005JPAO|3.0|This is a film about what politicians and celebrities \\"owe\\" the public and the media. The message of the film is that it is the duty of a public figure to give \\"the people\\" what they want even if it doesn't necessarly reflect the actual emotions of the person in question. <br /> <br />The film begins with the death of Princess Diana. Her death initiates a media circus and she is treated as a great person though in life she accomplished little other than getting lots of press coverage for herself. The politicians immediately make the rounds of the media programs, say all the right things and express the manipulative \\"false\\" emotions that press/public want to hear. But the royals themselves and especially the queen are not in front of the press making the expected over the top dramatic false emotional displays of \\"grief\\". They also don't immediately move back to the media center of London. In the film's view of things, these are \\"bad\\" things. <br /> <br />The film, like many people today, assumes that there is \\"one\\" right way to show the emotion of grief and that such displays need to be made in front of the Cameras as quickly as possible. The idea that individuals have different ways of expressing emotion is lost in the self-help fed culture of amature experts. Phillip, for scheduling activities to take the children's mind off the tragedy is made out to be a \\"monster\\". But who is really the monster? Is it a man who attempts to keep children away from a media circus or is it the people who want to feed those children into the media circus? <br /> <br />The queen and company not returning to London starts to ignite events in London. The press, unhappy at not getting the story they wanted, starts to fuel public opinion against the Queen. The politicians then start to see the unpopularity of the Queen as a drag on the popularity of their party and start putting pressure on. The people (and really the media as well) are demanding a public show of grief for Diana. The queen must give the people what they expect. The life and death of modern politics: Poll Numbers are dragged out as a reason why the Queen must make an over the top false public display of grief that she doesnt want to make. But she resists. <br /> <br />Meanwhlie, the media has stirred up the crazies that follow on the edges of celebrity. The film tries hard to convince us that unbalanced people who express \\"grief\\" by putting \\"they (the royals) have your blood on their hands\\" are somehow normal people. Diana was a divorced woman who died in a traffic accident in Paris. What kind of person blames the ex-mother in law in \\"blood on your hands\\" terms? Thats crazy-talk. And yet the film treats it as a real expression of public opinion. <br /> <br />More pressure is brought and finally the queen attempts to make a public statement herself. But in the most surreal moment of the film, the political PR people demand that the statement be rewritten so that the words \\"sound human\\". Incredibly, the film's message here is that a real message by a real human being sounds less human than text written by a bunch of Public relations hack writers.  <br /> <br />We live in an age where public moments and public emotions are scripted. Where the words and feelings of real people don't sound human to many of us anymore and where we demand (as the film does) made-for-tv moments of false grief. And if we don't get them, the person responsible must be destroyed. <br /> <br />The Queen makes the statement. The media and press get what they want. The politicians get what they want. And \\"the people\\" seem to get what they want. But the question I was left with was why the statement was necessary. Why do public figures \\"owe\\" the media or \\"the people\\" anything?  And what especially do they owe the public emotional displays that are often false? <br /> <br />This film is a message film. It is blatently one-side and manipulative. It is all the worse because it uses real people who are still alive to make its points. Some people do extraordinarily well in the film as to their portrayal. Others are played almost as charactures. <br /> <br />The message the film wants to present is that the old \\"out of touch\\" royals need to modernize themselves. The message that the film unintentionally presents is that modern public life is entirely fake and driven by the stories the media decide to present. If you give the media the story they want, you are a good person and they will treat you well. If you don't give them what they want, they will fill the newsprint and airtime with attacks on you. <br /> <br />According to the film's thinking, the right reaction for a Queen on hearing of Diana's death would have been to rush off to consult public relations experts and get everyone in front of the TV cameras as quickly as possible. Regardless of real emotions, they should have acted out film or television movie \\"grief\\". Everything and every word would have been scripted and planned out with regard to media coverage day by day until the funeral. <br /> <br />The film might have been better if it had dealt with the broader implications of events and been less one-sided. But it didn't. The iconic moment of the movie is when the speechwriters come in to change the words of a real person to make them sound \\"more human\\". There is so much wrong with that, words fail. <br /> <br />

Marlo Morgan has a fine time making up all kinds of rediculous details about Aboriginal life and culture.  She even seems to frequently confuse Aboriginal culture with North American Native American practices. <br /> <br />In addition, her writing style is clunky and laughably bad in places.  She didn't even take the time to ensure that the \\"important message\\" that she was making up was cohesive or followed any internal logic.  She just rambles on about various New Age concepts, presneting a hackneyed and confusing message about the evils of Western Civilization. <br /> <br />The really funny part is that Morgan doesn't seem to be able to shake her ingrained ethnocentrism, as she makes rediculous claims about Aboriginee feet being \\"hoof like,\\" and claims with a straight face that up until the 1990's, Australians didn't have window screens. <br /> <br />It's just bad all around. <br />
B00005JPP6|4.0|Work hard, but not too hard.  If you show your co-workers up, you could end up eliminated--either transferred or fired.  That's what PC Nicholas Angel found out.  When he got 9 Commendations in one year, the London officials promoted him and sent him to a model village, Sandford, where there hadn't been a murder in years.   <br /> <br />Angel quickly discovered Sandford was too good to be true.  His predecessor probably found out the same thing--but he went loony.  Angel, with the help of his cop-movie loving partner, Danny, decides to clean up the town instead.   <br /> <br />I laughed so hard at points my sides hurt, but there were also a couple of places where I felt a little ill.  \\"Hot Fuzz\\" poked fun at just about every US police film notion.

0767805712|5.0|<br />This film takes place in a not to distant future, after a high-profile murder has been committed at an elite company named Gattacca.  The story's main character works for this elite company, and the film shows how this murder affects the events related to him. <br /> <br />The setting is amid a society that \\"creates\\" their children made to order through genetic enhancement.  This creates more capable humans, but also creates an underclass who are relegated to the menial tasks of society.  Anyone in this \\"class\\" wanting a better life must find creative (read illegal) ways of taking on the identity of someone genetically superior, but has fallen on hard times, so is willing to sell their identity.  The name given to a person taking on the new identity is considered an \\"In-valid\\" (if caught). <br /> <br />The story tells of our main character, an elite amongst the company's elite even though genetically his is an \\"in-valid\\", one with a purchased, superior identity to hide his own.  He does this because his dream is to explore space and the way to do this is to work for the company Gattacca (which would never hire him due to his genetic \\"inferiority\\".)  He must live with the actual person his identity was purchased from and the film contrasts their situations well - An underdog who overcomes, and a \\"superior\\" who acts and thinks anything but.  A love story is also intertwined with the main character and a woman investigating the murder, who also works with him. <br /> <br />*  The story is about the triumph of the human spirit against the most insurmountable of obstacles. <br />*  The story just happens to take place in the not-too-distant future, but is not \\"futuristic\\" or about space at all.  It is a drama that just happens to take place in a still familiar future. <br />*  The main character is an underdog by all accounts.. <br />*  This film was nominated for an academy award for Best Art Direction alongside Kundun, L.A. Confidential, Men In Black and Titanic.  In my opinion Gattacca should have won and I think you will agree when you watch it.  <br />*  The marketing was not well devised when this film originally opened, which explains why you may not be familiar with this title, but is definitely one of the best films out there. <br />*  FYI #1: The title \\"Gattacca\\" is the name of the company that the main character works for, but is also made up of the 4 letters used to describe the 4 building blocks that make up DNA (GTCA).  DNA and its genetic altering is a main theme this film incorporates. <br />*  FYI #2: many shots of the building the company Gattacca occupies are set in the actual Marin County Civic Center in California designed by the elite great architect Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1959, almost 40 years prior to the opening of the movie.  One of the wings of the real building is actually called the \\"Halls of Justice.\\"  It's ironic compared to the main character and his story.

This one stands on its own as an original mix of harsh political commentary, family drama, black comedy, and horror.  The metaphor for the hysteria over the asian SARS epidemic is thick and the accusatory tone towards America's interventionist ways and the alarmist media's sensationalism is thicker.  But don't think this is some heavy-handed self-serving political film that wallows in its own symbolism; this film is about the importance of family pulling together and taking care of each other when noone else will.  Oh yes, and there's a monster in there somewhere too.  I'm going to drop a few minor spoilers now so if you want to go in completely cold and experience the full thrill I received viewing this movie you might want to go watch the film now.  Alright, on with the content review.  Let me put it this way, I got my money's worth in the first 20 minutes of the film.  The sudden appearance of the beast breaks the most entrenched of monster movie standards: the slow reveal.  The almost complete lack of buildup shocked me as the monster came charging out of the background in its high-velocity and unsettlingly awkward gait with ferocious momentum sending humanity flying left and right.  What follows is one of the greatest rampage sequences ever seen by human eyes.  I was absolutely thrilled by it and only the most jaded of film fans could feel otherwise.  In fact, aside from a few gaping plot holes, my only real complaint about this movie is that it climaxes so soon.  That's not to say the rest of the film isn't good, but it never reaches that fever pitch again.  As the trigger-happy government declares quarantine and almost immediately begins asserting it's will on the victims -even as they still mourn their lost family members- the media spreads word of a deadly and highly contagious virus that the creature is carrying (hence, \\"the host\\").  But as the film progresses, we see no evidence of any abnormal sickness, just the paranoia of the people in reaction to the media's hysterics and government's jumping to conclusions.  As our protagonists, the Park family, search for their little girl (Hyun-seo, taken to the monster's den for later consumption) we come to see that when the government is incompetent and overbearing and the general populace is collectively terrified of the guy standing next to them the only things you can rely on are your own family and what you can see and do for yourself.  The ne'er-do-well Park family consists of Hyun-seo's father, a slow-witted narcoleptic, her aunt who's a professional archer with a penchant for choking under pressure, a college-educated uncle with a hot temper who can't hold a job, and a caring grandfather who holds them all together.  The dysfunction of the family is humorous to watch, but the devotion they all share in the search for the little girl is touching; and that's the real heart and soul of this film.  The monster is menacing, the government is corrupt, the Americans are comically over-the-top self-serving jerks, the populace at large are terrified for all the wrong reasons, and the only real disease is the paranoia spread by the media but the Park family's struggle is the real story here and it's a great one.nce, \\"the host\\").

B00005M91K|3.0|Not a single word is spoken throughout the entire movie; the images speak for themselves. There is lots of visuals to feast your eyes on. It will remind you how good one has it living in America in the 21st century. The movie doesn't preach or make extensive criticisms - just shows what was observed with a 77-mm lens. Often, the settings are confusing and refernces get lost on the general public, and one almost wishes that there was an explanatory audio track to along with this documentary (there might be on the DVD of this film, but I saw this movie in theaters).
0552998087|2.0|I love car trips and also have memories of childhood back seat adventures, so I looked forward to this read.  I made it about half way through and gave it up as a depressing waste of time.  For a much better look at regional quirks and differences I recommend another mid-westerner, Calvin Trillin.  In ALICE, LET'S EAT, for example, he visits places with people much different from himself...and writes with great wit about what he sees and does.  If he makes a bit of fun of his adventures it is infused with a fondness for the people he meets and a delightful self deprecating attitude.  Quite the opposite of Bryson's arrogant attitude.
1416914285|2.0|I liked the world that was portrayed in this book a lot, and I thought that it was done pretty well.  But I have to say that some parts of the book just didn't make sense to me, and bits and pieces of the plot and the characters seemed to morph unexpectedly.  People would remember certain parts of conversations, and not other, critical parts, which confused me to no end.  I wasn't sure if it was a mistake, or if the characters were supposed to actually have forgotten.  I also was disappointed by the lack of depth in the story overall - the setting was really rich, but the characters and the plot were pretty predictable and I saw every twist coming way ahead of time - so much so that I thought the author must be setting me up to be shocked, but the shock never came.  I did enjoy the book, and will read the next two, but I'm hoping that the following books will be more creative in terms of plot and that the characters will become more easy to relate to and like.
185984054X|3.0|You gotta love the title \\"The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice\\" it's irreverent, funny, sacrilegious, and not a little bit smug.  Unless you're a devout Catholic, it can't fail to amuse, and to provoke.  And that's the point.    In a thin little polemic, Hitchens blasts at the Catholic Icon in an attack that's high on rhetoric but unfortunately low on facts.  He can't be bothered to even mention Teresa's birth name (Agnes Bojaxhiu) until page 79 (of 98) and then he tells us remarkably little about her; he tells us that her organization, `Missionaries of Charity' numbers \\"some 4,000 nuns and 40,000 lay workers\\" (p. 14) but says almost nothing about how it is organized, how it operates and what it actually does.  Instead, he assaults her with labels: she's a \\"religious fundamentalist, a political operatives, a primitive sermonizer\\" (p. 11)  Her motives are \\"questionable\\" (p. 37). The point of her endeavors was to promote a \\"cult\\" of \\"death and suffering and subjugation\\" (p.41)    Hitchens has three lines of attack on Mother Teresa:  I'll list them in increasing order of credibility.  First, Hitchens argues that although Teresa claimed to be above (or \\"beyond\\") politics (p.86), she actually championed publicly numerous conservatives causes - primarily the opposition to the \\"unholy trinity\\" of abortion, divorce and contraception.  Second, Teresa associated with and lent credibility to various questionable characters, including the wife of Haitian dictators \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier, corrupt US businessmen, and Nancy Reagan.  Finally, Hitchens argues that Teresa's various enterprises sacrificed the wellbeing of her patients for various metaphysical, one might even say aesthetical, goals.    Attacking Mother Teresa for her conservative views is both silly and unfair.  The positions she took on abortion, contraception and divorce are mainstream Catholic views.  I admit that in my view those positions vary between absurdity and cruelty, yet they are commonplace Catholics opinions and it seems unreasonable to single out Teresa for holding them and for speaking out on them.  She was, after all, a Nun.  To expect her to spout Hitchens' Liberal views is ridiculous.    Hitchens makes a good case that Teresa might have chosen the people she associated with more carefully, and might have done better to tone down her rhetorical championing of them.  But everyone who sets out to make a difference in the world must deal with the people it is populated with; one is bound to be friendly with some less then perfect individuals, and the ones Hitchens come up with are not exceptionally unsavory.  One suspects that had Teresa actually associated with the true monstrous leaders of the twentieth century (and alas, there were many of those), Hitchens would have gladly informed us of it.  That he has to satisfy himself with such little fish - a Haitian dictator, a couple of American con men - surely speaks for something.    The most serious allegation is that Mother Teresa's help to the poor was seriously compromised by her metaphysical, aesthetical considerations: that the poor are suffering with Christ, and that their suffering plays a role in the grand scheme of things.  Thus Hitchens quotes a Doctor who visited one of her clinics and observed lack of elementary medical competence (p.38) a volunteer in Calcutta saw used needless washed under cold water and then reused, without the staff even bothering to sterilize them (p. 40).  The allegation is that Teresa cared about baptizing the dying more then saving them, about saving souls more then mending bodies.    It's a serious charge, and some of the evidence Hitchens presents is suggestive, but it's far from enough to condemn Teresa.  Heading a huge organization, Teresa cannot be responsible for details in every shelter for the poor and the dying.  And although Hitchens suggests that Teresa has huge resources at her disposal, he presents very little evidence about her organization financial means and expenditures.  It's likely that the organization has savings - it's simply too large to go without them.  But Hitchens does not come close to proving that Teresa could have done substantially more, or that she intentionally neglected the care of patients.    Furthermore, one must always remember that Teresa was a Nun, and that hers is a religious organization.  Spending considerable sums of money on religious artifacts, and choosing staff for their religious rather then medical qualifications would very reasonable from her perspective.  Her mandate must make her care for people's souls at least as much as for their bodies, and it is unfair to attack her if she did that.    Hitchens writes well, and scores some points against Mother Teresa.  Uncritical worship of her, as of anyone, is not advisable.  But as objectionable as Teresa's rhetoric might have been at times, as foreign as her philosophy was, Hitchens does not prove that she was not a dedicated crusader for the poor.  But although we find her not guilty, the seeds of doubt are there;  The case against Mother Teresa deserves better advocacy then Christopher Hitchens's.

B00005JPD0|4.0|Follow this fast-paced and hypnotic thriller through time and space (...okay, I didn't really mean to rhyme there...). Denzel Washington stars as Doug Carlin, an ATF agent called in to join a special forces unit that is tapped to discover the identity of a terrorist who recently killed over 500 innocent people in a ferry boat explosion. As Doug struggles to accept and understand the high tech methods utilized by this special unit to try to track this murderer, he unwittingly finds himself falling in love with a young woman who was killed in the explosion...or was she? Can Doug use the special unit's \\"surveillance\\" machine to transport himself back in time, and save the lives of so many innocents -- including the woman he's falling in love with? Or will his attempts to change the past forever negatively alter the future?<br /><br />Once the mechanics of the plot are understood, the average observor can theorize for themselves the natural course the storyline will take. In this respect, the big \\"shockers\\" of the film turn out to be not as shocking -- but in my opinion, that doesn't make them any less exciting. When they are initially explaining the way the unit's special surveillance machine works, it kind of throws you for a loop and you're left trying to digest this new information and understand it, while at the same time trying to keep up with the plot that has moved on without you. Afterwards though, it gets easier to understand, which is good.<br /><br />As always, Denzel Washington excells at this particular type of role (you know, the strong, in-charge detective, who will stop at nothing to save the day). Val Kilmer and Adam Goldberg embody solid supporting roles, providing some much needed nuggets of comedy and sarcasm amongst a sea of thrills, chills, and edge-of-your-seat drama. James Caviezel's character is in a very minimal portion of the film, but he is still important nonetheless. James seems to excell at being the really creepy guy in a lot of movies -- he is very good at it, regardless of the amount of screen time he receives.<br /><br />The film is a little choppy, with key elements appearing very early in the film, and are not elaborated on to the point where everything makes sense until much further in the movie. This sort of editing reminds me a little of the film [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]] in that respect, although \\"Memento\\" utilizes this out-of-sequence kind of editing far more than \\"Deja Vu\\" does. Either way, it's a lot of fun to try to piece everything together, and do a little vicarious sleuthing to try to figure things out before each twist is revealed.<br /><br />Special features on this DVD include deleted and extended scenes, and a few specially formatted \\"behind the scenes\\" type featurettes designed to tie into the theme of the movie, which is kind of cool. Overall, it's a good disc, and is probably worth owning, even if it's the kind of movie that can't be watched very often due to the fact that it loses some of it's excitement once you know whats going on.<br /><br />Bottom line, give it a try, and you won't be disappointed.

B00005JPPI|3.0|With legitimate time wasting movies like \\"Perfect Stranger\\" out there I feel almost bad about picking on this one, one that I actually liked. But I liked it despite the all too familiar taste on my tongue. Willy (Ryan Gosling) is ready to move on to fame and fortune and Lakers tickets, but first he needs to close just one more case. To make the situation even better for him the case is open and shut; murder weapon, signed confession, so on and so forth. And from there things go predictably downhill. The weapon is no good, the confession is no good, the arresting officer was fornicating with the victim, so on and so forth. The script works the same way a magic trick does where we the audience spend the first half of the film watching it write itself into an airtight box and sink itself to the bottom of the ocean just so that the second half can be spent watching it escape. It is all very tired, of course the writer is smarter than the characters, but there are bits of joy to be taken from this type of story. Really it is just a high gloss version of the slop James Patterson pumps out three times a year. And no I didn't believe any of it for a second, it is pure courtroom fantasy. But I did enjoy the dark sense of humor, its half attempt at an anti-careerist message, and obviously Ryan Gosling. There is nothing here to make you rush out and see it in theaters, and its forthcoming mediocre box office receipts will prove it, but a year from now when it shows up on HBO I say give it a chance.<br /><br />In the opening scene director Gregory Hoblit makes an interesting decision as he goes for a good vs. bad conflict as opposed to a did he vs. didn't he one. There is no doubt in anybody's mind whether or not Ted (Anthony Hopkins) did it because we watch as he shoots her right in the face. So from then on Hoblit is stuck painting Gosling (young) as the hero and Hopkins (Not young) as the murderous husband. That means that even though Ted is the better, more likeable character we have to spend the movie pretending to root for Willy. To make this happen the writers stack the deck in his favor, he won't cheat to win the case, he turns to a selfless public servant for help and he has some sexual tension going on with a decent looking blond. Never mind that the real Willy would never do any of these things. As far as his romantic interest goes it is interesting that it isn't developed further, just kind of hinted at and then abandoned. Because if \\"300\\" has taught us anything it is that girls will accompany their boyfriends to any movie, no matter how stupid, so long as the producers throw in a half-baked love story to pacify them. For a while it looked as though the film was going to have to choose between the morality of bringing down the wife's shooter and this \\"don't go corporate\\" message that they seemed to want to spread. Of course if you have ever seen a Hollywood movie I am giving nothing away by saying that have and eat their cake. Which is fine, I forgive them. I also forgive them for this weak third act that is dragged out to provide the cliffhangers and easy resolutions that keep the masses coming back for more. I forgive mainly because Gosling is so good here. A pay check movie this is indeed, but he has charisma to spare and isn't afraid to share it. If it weren't for his girly-man choices thus far in his career he would be a full blown movie right now. But alas, he doesn't really do movies that involve him shooting a gun and hence the fact that most Americans don't know him. But hopefully people will see him here and when they do they will enjoy themselves with this light weight yet engrossing film. ***1/4cter we have to spend the movie pretending to root for Willy.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Recently my husband, daughter and I went to NYC to see the Broadway version of the POTO. The show was outstanding and a pleasure to see on stage, but I have read many reviews that criticize this newest film adaptation. I strongly disagree! This special addition DVD delighted my entire family. I am very impressed with this movie version and highly reccommend it. Its depiction of the POTO story is evocatively romantic and the music is a \\"perfect\\" score. The special additions reveal just what lengths Andrew Lloyd Webber, director Joel Schumacher and their  collaborators went through to finally achieve this production. It also contains the evolution of the POTO stage show as well as the movie. Gerard Butler is the ultimate Phantom and I was enchanted with his singing.  If you love captivating music and romantic movies - buy this DVD.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|<br />What more can be said.........Keira's Elizabeth is a one-of-a-kind:  Lizzie is a glittering star beginning to end.  Ah, but it is Matthew's Darcy who grabs this viewer throughout.  It's he I hope to see, who I watch for to appear in every scene, background....foreground....where is he?  But, why he, you may ask?  Well, it's because of the \\"Darcy's fall\\" which we begin to see that he is giving us.  And we know, if we but think of it, that from that first sidewise glance he gives Lizzie in the film's beginning ball scene, he is lost and \\"Darcy's fall\\" has begun. <br />  <br />There are just two scenes that I can watch, watch, watch, re-watch, rewind and watch again.  In order of my passion for them, they are:  (1) The pouring rain, outdoor pavilion scene where \\"Darcy's fall\\" has neared its end and he declares his love to Lizzie (the intensity of that final moment, with their physical closeness and their seen and felt overpowering desire to kiss, is overwhelming for us).  (2)  That near-dawn, meadow scene in which each discovers the other walking, Lizzie because her fear of lost love keeps her from sleeping, Darcy because he must seek her out for one last try.  And when their approach one to the other is done, and we hear him--emotions on fire--stutter out to her:  \\"I love....love....I love you,\\" we know then.....at that very moment.....\\"Darcy's fall\\" into love is now complete. <br /> <br />**** <br />
B00005JJX8|5.0|This movie is pure entertainment.  Hitchcock loved Grace Kelly, Cary Grant, food and the south of France, and it all shows here.  They must have had a wonderful time making this terrific film and we are lucky to have this record of it.   <br /> <br />Grace Kelly must have been about 25, pristinely lovely as a white gardenia in full bloom.  She's more than just a beautiful blond though and brings something of charm and intelligence of the mature woman she is on the verge of becoming.  (Too bad she married that playboy prince and ruined it all...but that's another story.)  Cary Grant, ultra tan as was the fashion at that time, is still very handsome and, at 50, is almost mesmerizingly charming.   The chemistry between the two, despite the age difference, is terrific.  At first Grant holds back, being a gentleman, but Kelly pursues and at the end, she catches her thief.  <br /> <br />To me this is more of a love story than a mystery  and I didn't care in the least who the real cat burglar was...but maybe that's cuz I am a woman.   <br /> <br />The censorship of the 50's was much more strict than in our times, which, I think, heightened the charm of the romance.  Alone together in her hotel room, with Kelly looking like a goddess from the moon in her white chiffon dress, one wonders how Grant can keep his cool for as long as he does.  When they finally kiss (!) we are treated to shots of fireworks through the balcony window.  It may sound corny but it is tremendously effective and very sweet.  Bring back Romance!  <br /> <br />The visuals are splendid--there's plenty of beauty to fill up every screen, whether it's shots of the blue blue sea, French chefs in mile-high hats or a flower market filled with pink and red blooms.  The costumes are lavish.  In the opening credits, a travel poster brags, \\"If you love life, you'll love France!\\"  I think that pretty much sums up this picture.

B00000DR5D|5.0|This live album was released hot on the heels of their 1975 masterpiece Rubycon and has a similarly gothic and gloomy atmosphere.  In contrast with other live albums however, this sounds just like it was recorded in the studio - the sound quality is excellent and the audience can not be heard at all (apart from the beginning and end of the piece).  Ricochet was cobbled together from live performances recorded during the autumn of 1975 in both France and Britain.  If the recording was taken from a number of separate performances, there is no evidence of that in terms of sound quality - furthermore, I feel that the the performances were seamlessly and expertly \\"stitched together\\".<br /><br />The lineup on Ricochet is the classic incarnation of the band: Edgar Froese (electric guitar; bass guitar; mellophonium; mellotron; VCS3 Synthi); Chris Franke (double moog synthesizer; Synthi A; organ; piano; VCS3; drums); and Peter Baumann (Organ; Synthi A; Flute; electric piano; VCS3).  The guys put in a great performance and Edgar throws in some slightly distorted electric guitar work to spice things up a bit.<br /><br />The 38'14\\" Ricochet composition is split into two parts including Ricochet (Pt. 1 - 17'03\\") and Ricochet (Pt. 2 - 21'11\\").  The music is classic Tangerine Dream, with loads of brooding analog synthesizers, pulsating sequencers, and dreamy atmospheres.  There are small drum and electric guitar parts here and there, but for the most part this is a synth-dominated album with very quiet textures.  As can be imagined, there are elements of albums like Rubycon and Stratosphere (1976) on Ricochet.  A very nice combination in fact.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album from the classic mid-1970's period of the bands' output and is highly recommended along with Phaedra (1974); Rubycon; and Stratosphere.
B000FOQ1EA|3.0|I bought these Sibelius recordings from Blomstedt and the San Francisco SO when they came out ecasue Decca had started producing such excellent sonics form that source, as evidenced by a series of spectauclar Strauss recordings. I knew form experience that Blomstedt was a steady hand at conducting and that he had done wonders in building up the morale and execution in San Francisco. But one by one his Sibelius readings truck me as underpowered and cautious.<br /><br />I haven't changed my opinion hearing them gathered together at bargain price. The sound remains wonderful, and on that score I can see why reviewers rave. But this music inspires so much more passion from other conductors--Karajan and Bernstein lead my list--that Blomostedt's handling feels limited. He can build up beautifully balanced climaxes, as in the Seventh, one of the better readings here. ut the Third toptoes along without finding a real emotional high point, and the heroic Second and fifth go to sleep. In all, I can't see why this should be anyone's top choice in music recorded so spectacularly elsewhere.
0553588486|1.0|I've read all four books that have been published in this series. It has moments of brilliance, but mostly it plods.  It's heralded by many reviewers as somehow realistic in its engagement with sex and violence.  Not even close.  The sex scenes are bumbling, something a teenager might write who's seen to many porn films in an attempt at passion but there is nothing that remotely resembles real human sexuality here.  Someone touted strong woman characters but I thought they were all caricatures mostly they are whores (which seem to be the most common kind of women we meet making the world seem rather lopsided), burly inn-maids, or manly woman.  Early on there were some nice reversals with bad guys becoming good and visa-versa , but it's happened so often as to have become predictable.  The worse thing is I expect the series will never be finished.  I've followed the author on his website and he spends most of his time promoting his books, visiting conventions, writing little side books, promoting film and merchandise about the book and it appears he hasn't written on it in years.  Do yourself a favor and skip this serious until it's completed.  Even then this isn't great stuff.  Enough to keep you interested but nothing I would read if I could do it over, it started so compellingly I had high hopes and have managed to keep that hope alive for four books--it does dance on the edge of being something wonderous--but all in all its just not worth it.  I invested a lot of time reading these mammoth books in hope for something worthy.  It's just not there and apparently never will be finished so don't bother.
B000P6PVLC|4.0|I really liked this movie; to me the stark contrast of the Muslim way of live verses that of the west and the typical subtle prejudices that people have is what makes this movie interesting. Before the interlinking of the stories were revealed I noticed myself assuming things about characters that had yet to be revealed, and once they were is brought to life to me the phrase \\"there are always two sides to every story\\" if you don't like analyzing movies than this is probably not for you. However, if you are interested in learning how you may judge or how you may assume things about other people who are different to you than this is a movie for you.

B000GFLKF8|5.0|This movie has 3 uniqueness'es that make it rise above other films that would be similar.   <br /> <br />1.  A cast of this power usually indicates a weak script and, unfortunately far too often, a poor delivery; but the Lead Roles: Clive Owen of [[ASIN:B0002YLCG0 King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)]], Denzel Washington of [[ASIN:B00020X88Y The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)]], and Jodie Foster of [[ASIN:B000BYY11Y Flightplan (Widescreen Edition)]] deliver the most powerful three characters I've ever seen in one movie. <br /> <br />2.  A heist movie is often so entangled with \\"good clichés\\" and showy maneuvers that it is laughable to imagine putting its plot to work.  This movie makes me believe it would work 19 times out of 20, and movies such as: [[ASIN:B000062XHI Ocean's Eleven (Widescreen Edition)]] I would give 3 times out 20.   <br /> <br />3.  The movie has an enjoyable social context as it moves between the worlds of the cop, the criminal, and the civilian.  Here none of the parties are vilified but all victimized; it's truly fascinating and complex.
B000JU7NCE|5.0|Can Someone please give me some feedback as to why there is a \\"parental advisatory\\" labeled on the DVD ??? \\"I have heard someone refer's to Robert Smith as 'Robert Palmer' and a remark is made by someone, \\"F*** Robert Palmer, whether this is a fan or Smith(Which would be understandable as the two are not even on the same parallel. Not taking anything away from Robert Palmer, ROBERT SMITH is An artist well acomplished in every sense of the word!!! As the other members of the CURE are to. Unique in everything they do, the only thing repitious about THE CURE is everything they do is different and mind-boggeling.

I thought \\"Greatest Hit's\\" was the Finale. \\"Thank God for this album - Fantastic!!!!! All the new artists and releases in 2004 - \\"BANG\\" The End Of The World was the best video and song in 2004. The video's to all their songs have a way of catering to all the fans as everyone interpets them differently but as always they still hit the nail on the head with each. Parents be Advised !!! If your children hear this group and their music, their rap will be CRAP as they will find out MUSIC IS AN ART!!! Cursing, Profanity, Insults, derogratory comments towards women or race, won't be found here. This is what MUSIC was meant to be. LET THE LISTENER DECIDE.

B000BBOUU4|4.0|I'm a sucker for special editions on movies I really like, but there's not much more to offer on this dvd set than you'd get if you purchased the cheaper one. The cheaper one actually has inserts, while this one doesn't.<br /><br />But hey, I like having special editions with a few extras, so I'd purchase again. (changing out inserts.. :0 )
B000O178BY|4.0|This is the only NIN effort that I own. I anticipated picking this release up with reservations. I am not one for loud industrial music. I always perceived this Trent Reznor as a bit on the vulgar side. This album proves neither. It is an enjoyable listen. It is a \\"concept\\" album with a dark story and an awakening message. <br /> <br />What I found most enjoyable in Reznor's work is the subtle melodic phrases throughout. It is a beatiful subtlety that intertwines with the pumping sounds throughout. After the second listen this becomes more apparent. It works well with the lyrical content.  <br /> <br />Reznor's vocal range is amazing in \\"In This Twilight\\".  \\"The greater Good\\" shows just how good his melodic phrasing is. \\"The Beginning Of The End\\" should be playing on most radio stations soon. It is one of those songs that will have everyone moving.  <br /> <br />All in all, the album was refreshing and intriging. It is a great headphones experience. There are some truly strange sounds that keep the music fresh. But it is the melodic undertones, and especially the acoustic piano, that make this impressive.
B000O178BY|5.0|This album is the truth. One of the best NIN albums I've ever heard
B000JIHP88|4.0|My only complaint is that the remote is loud, so we never use it.  The music is great, although, some of the music is programmed under the wrong composer.  Oh well.  I guess the babies aren't reading the composers' names anyway!

0374530718|3.0|There are two ways that you can view Sophie's World. You can see it as a novel that teaches you about the history of philosophy, or you can see it as a book about the history of philosophy with a story attached. I prefer to think of it as the latter, because about halfway through the book, the story gets very, very, silly, very, very fast. This story starts off as a mystery involving a philosophy course that came out of nowhere, strange postcards, and a god like being only known as The Major. But around the halfway point of the story, the narrative loses all reason, and becomes absurd. Dogs start talking, mirrors start winking, and characters from fairy tales randomly show up. Even through this, the philosophy sections of the book stay strong. These sections start off with the early Greek philosophers, then advances on to more recent philosophers, like Freud and Marx. These sections are mainly shown as dialogs between the two main characters, and do a great job of teaching about philosophy. These sections are the highlights of the book. It's like taking a class on philosophy in book form. So if you can get through the annoying story, and appreciate the philosophy, you should like this book.
B000O174CM|4.0|I went to the movies with the thought that I probably would not like this mover and was pleasantly surprised. I love the freshness that all of the actors brought to their roles. I am not what you call a Beyonce fan, but I found myself enjoying her in this role. I have always loved musicals and can't wait to add this one to my collection. My grandchildren loved this movie as well and constantly sing all the songs.
0385340540|2.0|I felt cheated and ultimately disappointed after reading this book and having spent about 3 hours on it in total. Thank goodness it was a library rental and I had not invested any of my own funds for it. The beginning started out quite suspenseful and had my interest piqued, but the middle section about Bologna (bologne is more like it, if you ask me) dragged on and on with all that useless crap about learning Italian, Mr. Grisham even had the nerve to include all that Italian in there. Backman was not a sympathetic character at all (greedy scum) and I kept hoping that he will get killed so that the story would finally end. And after all, what are the chances that a lawyer will have the skills and smarts necesssary to escape from a hoarde of professional killers hired to do their job? Lame and a sorry waste of my time.
0385340540|1.0|I've read a lot of works from mr. Grisham and \\"The Broker\\" can hardly be classified as one of his best. To put it short, this book is a short story \\"pumped\\" into a novel.  The plot is fairly predictable and the \\"spy-vs-spy\\" part is really naive.   Honestly, the tricks \\"invented\\" to escape from Italy and from Europe, as the way the character comes back to the USA wouldn't work in a third-world, bribing-managed country.  What is worse is that the book go on and describing the main character living in Bologna (IT), learning Italian, enjoying the food and the monuments, waiting that something happens. A good hundred of pages (if not more) that could easily be saved, turning this novel into what really is: a short tale.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Neon Bible cements Arcade Fire as one of the best original music bands to appear on the scene in ages and not just original, but mind-blowing good. Not only are the lyrics some of the most radical you will hear (the whole album seems almost based on a theme of the loss of faith) they also grab you by the scruff and shake you around. There is so much truth in the lyrics and the music is POW and yes it's better than \\"Funeral\\". How that was possible? Well that's the revolution that is Arcade Fire!<br /><br />While it takes awhile to get into this album, so did Funeral, but stick with it and you will have something that you will keep going back to repeatedly... gosh this is just too good not to recommend with aces.<br /><br />Be overcome.
B00006HBUA|4.0|The Mystery Inc gang and Scooby Doo have gone their seperate ways, though a mystery by way of Spooky Island brings them back together. Something's happening to the holidaying college students there, something's changing them. Independently, then together, the gang works to solve the mystery, which turns out to be a little more real, and a little more mysterious, then they'd hoped... <br /> <br />It's pretty enjoyable and colourful, even if its not quite the same as the TV series. Scooby Doo is animated pretty nicely and Matthew Lilard is right on as Shaggy. The audio commentary with the cast of the Scooby gang is pretty entertaining too. Interesting stuff. Worth a look for Scooby Doo fans, I thought.
B00062RCBW|5.0|The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.<br /><br />Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.' Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the TOS series but is more of the same again (even remaking some TOS episodes), this time with more characters, more action and more special effects.<br /><br />SEASON 1<br />All of the main characters in the TNG series are in episode one, Captain Jean-Luc Picard,  Commander William T. Riker,  Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Tasha Yar, Lieutenant Worf, Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher, Lt. Commander/Commander Deanna Troi, Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher.  Only Natasha Yar quits before the first season is finished. Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher is replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski for Season two. Ensign Wesley Crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after Season four. The Enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing, playing an important function in many episodes. The use of computer generated images (a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987!) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences, planets, backdrops, an improved bridge main viewer and windows! Advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android. TNG Season One attempts to relate with TOS by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made TOS so interesting. The stories (also written by TOS's DC Fontana) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s, early 90s, when TNG first aired. Season One of TNG is mostly about deities, infections, alien cultures, galactic politics, time travel, alien forces, mind control, family matters, computer malfunctions and Starfleet Academy. There are also the unforgettable episodes `Encounter at Farpoint' which introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise and the mysterious Q,  `Where No One has Gone Before' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos, `Datalore' which features two Data characters, `Heart of Glory' with some in-depth revelations about Klingons , `Skin of Evil' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending, and the classic `Conspiracy' (this episode is uncut, which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious]) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of Starfleet. The bottom line for TNG: Season One is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out. Although we can debate about which is the better series, TNG or TOS, we still absolutely adore both. We might miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but hearing Picard saying `make it so' just makes our day.<br /><br />SEASON 2<br />Season Two, still carries on with repeating much of the stories in TOS, revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own, boosting Data's screen time, bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres, improved alien CGI and an enhancement in particle effects. They even attempt a type of morphing. Most of the main characters from Season One are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a beard), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow), Commander Deanna Troi (complete with low-cut red starfleet costume), Lt. Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher. However obviously Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar is gone but so is Dr. Beverly Crusher (who was not bad-looking), replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski (who looks like your granny!) for Season Two because Dr. Crusher has been reassigned to Starfleet Medical as explained in episode one of Season Three (in reality the TNG writers where having difficulties in developing Crusher's character, would later reinstate her for Season Three, dropping Pulaski because they felt her character was not working). Colm Meaney as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation from Season One gets more screentime, while the new Whoopi Goldberg chatacter, Guinan, is the wise El Aurian bartender in 10 Forward, the new bar room where the Enterprise crew get to relax. Except for this extra area the Enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more Enterprise based than Season One, or all of TOS, meaning Season Two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback, but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space' feel that would produce the `Deep Space Nine' series. Season Two of TNG is mostly about alien impregnation, mystery space, AI, the holodeck, interplanetary relations, rapid aging, justice, shape-shifting, time travel, family, the prime directive, kidnapping, cloning, war games and infections. The big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with Klingons and the first encounter with the BORG! The unforgettable episodes are, `Elementary, Dear Data' where Data takes on his Sherlock Holmes persona and we are introduced to the Moriarty character. `Loud as a Whisper' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator. `A Matter of Honor' is where Riker serves on a Klingon battleship. `Q Who?' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the Borg. The last episode of Season Two `Shades of Gray' may be one of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, which uses Riker's memories from Seasons One and Two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the Season One episode `Conspiracy' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious again]). The bottom line for TNG: Season Two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down, we get the Borg and lots and lots of Klingons. At this stage in the saga we might still miss Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume, but how will Picard defeat those assimilating half-man, half-machine entities that are heading his way? He better \\"make it so\\" with Season Three.<br /><br />SEASON 3<br />It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, \\"Evolution\\" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, \\"The Survivors\\" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, \\"Who Watches The Watchers?\\" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, \\"Offspring\\" sees Data creating another sentient android, \\"Sins of the Father\\" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defendhis family honour, \\"Hollow Pursuits\\" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, \\"Sarek\\" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh.<br /><br />SEASON 4<br />Not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" would deliver on at the end of Season III, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There was no time to lose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh... so here we are. With Season Three it was the dawn of the 90s and CGI had undergone some development and improvements (better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres, particle effects, lighting and subspace effects). With Season Three things started to have more of a movie budget look. Season Four tries to maintain that class. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip, adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic projection, survival,  loosing special abilities, renegade captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares, mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials, euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories, combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians, who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds, Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some great battle special effects, `Family' has Picard going home to see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact' sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption, Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three, and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" was, `Redemption, Part I' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say \\"I can live with a mystery\\" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we can...<br /><br />SEASON 5<br />Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of \\"Redemption, Part II\\" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: \\"Redemption part II\\" - this episode received as 12 age rating in the UK, because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9!<br /><br />SEASON 6<br />Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of \\"Time's Arrow\\" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression, android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty, love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves, command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith, doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are three very good episodes which really make the season worth. Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until the last second.<br /><br />SEASON 7<br />Star Trek: Season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion, making way for some Star Trek films, but in reality it is Deep Space Nine: Season 2 (DS9: Season 1 starts in star date chronological order with TNG: Season 6) that is the new trek. Fans of Star Trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional SF TV era. The conclusion of \\"Descent, Part II\\" has the finale of Lore. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for one episode. While Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran, was supposed to replace him, she only appears in one episode in Season 7, although the episode is a major one focused on her. Colm Meaney shows up again as Miles Edward O'Brien for the last episode. Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is gone without explanation (see the movie \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" on her). Alexander Rozhenko is back. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is not here either (after leaving for DS9). Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer, is back again. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about Lore, emotional studies, interfaces, mercenaries, nightmares, psychic trauma, Beverly and Picard, warp travel environmental damage, data's mother, alternate realities, the Pegasus, Worf's human brother, incubus, top secret missions, radiation sickness, deities, Troi and Worf, reverse evolution, Wesley and the Traveller, Klingon right of ascension, Picard's son, abiogenesis, Ro Laren and time travel. While there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one (\\"Masks\\" for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise) most are well above average and some are incredible. Memorable episodes include, Gambit, Forces of Nature, Inheritance, Lower Decks, Thine Own Self, Journey's end and Bloodlines. The Pegasus is probably the best episode of the Season, but the finale \\"All good things...\\" is really where it is at with some good aging effects, a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic Enterprise to die for. The series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek. In short there is nothing like ST:TNG. It evolved TV serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years. It set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars.Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip, adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic projection, survival,  loosing special abilities, renegade captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares, mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials, euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories, combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians, who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds, Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some great battle special effects, `Family' hasPicard going home to see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact' sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption, Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three, and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" was, `Redemption, Part I' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say \\"I can live with a mystery\\" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we can...    SEASON 5  Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger conclusion of \\"Redemption, Part II\\" is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character. Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans, communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters, addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis, eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression, time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an interesting episode about language, the introduction of the Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return, `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise, certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was, then we are there for it. As a note: \\"Redemption part II\\" - this episode received as 12 age rating in the UK, because it contains Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order. If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9!    SEASON 6  Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1 whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if you search the new forit. TNG has really good stories while DS9 gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of \\"Time's Arrow\\" is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a Bajoran.

B000ION23A|3.0|This was one I wasn't too interested in watching. My younger brother rented it off of netflix, but I chose to watch another movie instead of joining him and watching it.  <br /> <br />Then, several of the little kids in my church got copies, and ADORED it, so, I thought to myself. Why not just pick up a copy and see what all of the buzz is about?  <br /> <br />It was a very enjoyable film, and one I'm going to be buying once I finish saving for my computer. The animation was nice, but this is coming from somebody who didn't bother with the movie \\"ANTZ\\". The perspective is nothing new.  <br /> <br />It was a nice tale, decent-quailty animation and a cute story. Some gross-out humor (ANOTHER 'false teeth' joke? How many do we need?!) and minor language, but nothing too bad that I caught. (And I'm one of those people who looks at a movie twice, once watching it for my own enjoyment, and another watching it from a little kids point of view to see if it's okay to show babysitting.)  <br /> <br />Good for a watch, and I'm going to add this one to my video collection!  <br />
B00003CXI1|5.0|It's one thing to make a movie based on a popular book, but it is another to deliver the same effects from the book onto the screen. I am referring to the believability of the Wizarding world, which is the very heart of this movie. It is what Rowling was going for in her first novel and was beautifully conceived by Columbus and his Visual Effects wizards. <br />Even the cast was perfect, the trifecta playing Harry, Ron and Hermione was key through the whole movie. The movie virtually has no supporting cast because every actor on screen plays nicely into their roles. Especially the late Sir Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith who play their roles with such fervor that no one else could do it better (As Gambon is learning now playing Dumbledore) <br />Overall a fine movie with, given a few years, classic movie status.
B00005NB8K|4.0|It kind of reminded me of \\"Sid and Nancy\\" (Jim and Pam?), where a lot of liberties were taken to keep the story interesting, and mixed characters up, and the truth is in the music.  <br /> <br />Ray Manzarek said in an interview that the Miami incident cost his father a promotion, even though Doors money continues to roll in to a father he considered \\"dead\\". Jim's background before he became famous to me is more interesting, what led up to the Lizard King that started as a chubby Navy brat. You can also go on You Tube and see some of the projects like \\"Hwy\\" he worked on (should be on video, as should \\"Feast of Friends\\").  <br /> <br />\\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\" was where a lot of the story comes from but a lot is left out.  <br /> <br />As a movie, the music propels it, Morrison's poetry, and Val Kilmer really gets deep into it, definitely one of his most memorable roles, if not THE most. Irony that he was a Navy pilot in \\"Top Gun\\" and was the rebel son of a Navy Admiral in this?  <br /> <br />The members of The Doors all wrote books all worth checking out.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000OCXF0Q|2.0|There are many problems celebrities face when they become super-stars, and one of them is an enlarged ego. This is extremely apparent on Avril's new CD, seeing that it's so self-praising for really no reason. Lyrically, this album is garbage compared to Under My Skin, which is one of the best CDs released this decade in my opinion. Avril has no problem stealing your boyfriend, calling you a slut, or walking all over any guy who wishes to be in her presence, because after all, she is \\"the best damn thing\\" <br /> <br />I am also not a prude by any means of the imagination, but when you're target audience is 12 year old girls, isn't it a shame that you throw in meaningless curse words left and right that make it seem like Avril's trying to hard to grow up when really (as other reviewers have already said) this is her most immature record to date? <br /> <br />As far as the record goes musically, it's \\"Girlfriend\\" over and over again. She's 6 years too late for the pop-punk movement that Sum 41 and Blink 182 embraced, but no one has told her that. Remember, she's the \\"Best Damn Thing\\" so she can pretty much do what she wants even if it's meaningless and repetitive. Her ballads such as \\"Innocence\\" and \\"When You're Gone\\" are so bland that not only do they stick out like a sore thumb, they're monotonous at best. \\"Keep Holding On\\" would have been best shoved onto an extended version of Under My Skin, then I wouldn't have to deal with this CD. <br /> <br />
0151013047|5.0|This book offers the exact opposite of an \\"escape\\" into another world.  Instead, it holds up a mirror to the very world we live in, but we may not like everything we see.  Check that: We definitely won't like everything we see. <br /> <br />The parallels in the story between America/Erica and Christianity/Chris are never absolute, but offer a nuanced glimpse into the perspectives and approach that we think we relate to fully, until we realize that we don't relate to nearly as much as we thought. <br /> <br />The ambiguity throughout helps drive things forward -- there are no simple answers here.
B000NDIAWO|3.0|On the updated version of B'Day, Beyonce offers us six new songs. The song \\"Beautiful Liar\\" is interesting, but I don't consider it a great pop song. \\"Welcome To Hollywood\\" is a better song and I love Beyonce's vocals on it. She sings the song with such a rock edge, that I hope she considers doing a rock-soul album. \\"Flaws and All\\" has alot of opera influences in it which is odd when you consider todays' music market. \\"Still In Love (Kissing You)\\" is simply beautiful. Its songs like \\"Flaws and All\\" and \\"Still In Love (Kissing You)) that gives me hope about Beyonce. \\"Amor Gitano\\" is a wonderful song that will increase Beyonce's international appeal. \\"World Wide Woman\\" (a hidden track) is nice and is one of Beyonce's most pop records. Had she release these songs on the first version of B'Day, the cd would have been more successful and respected. However, I can't give this cd 5 stars. <br /> <br />I am a fan of Beyonce, but I have a SERIOUS problem with artists like her, Mariah Carey, and Usher. This business of re-releasing an album so you can get more profit is wrong. This doesn't sit well with fans like myself who can't help feeling that we are being taken advantage of. An artist should take the time to make sure their album is right BEFORE they release it. This is especially true when it comes to Beyonce, who has admitted that she recorded this album in only two weeks. The results speaks for itself. While, this version of B'Day is better I can only give it 3 1/2 stars. It also appears to me that Jay-Z's influences are starting to harm her music...alot of hard beats that are easily and quickly produced, but no real substance in her work. Its time for Beyonce to take a vacation and work on her craft. <br /> <br />There are additional tracks missing from this cd: \\"Lost Yo Mind\\", \\"Creole\\", \\"Back Up\\", \\"If\\" and at least three more I won't mention. They are worth a listen or two.
1400063515|5.0|Not since Gregory Bateson has a writer elucidated that how we look at the world can cause focus on the wrong things and thus be drawn to irrelevant, incomplete or incorrect conclusions that carry consequences both large and small.  For Bateson focus needed to be on 'relata' rather than things.  For Taleb, it is studying extremes rather than central tendencies.   <br /> <br />For me, both add immeasurably to the discussion as to how the world may actually work.  Thank you Mr. Taleb for taking the time and trouble to engage us in explanation and exposition.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I love this movie.  I've traveled to England several times and this comedy epitomizes British humor.  Bridget is such an easy character to relate to, a real woman with real problems.  We need more characters like her out there, women who have weight issues and can't speak in public.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fight scene between Mark and Daniel, it was something that you might see real men who are wimps really doing.  This movie is fantastic and I highly recommend it to all women.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The sound is spectacular, especially the audio DVD, which is all I've listened to.  The arrangements are interesting, and a refreshing adaptation of the music we've loved for decades.<br /><br />It is important to note that this was prepared for a Cirque de Soliel show.  So keeping that in mind, this is not 'George Martin gone wild' and messing with the music.  If anything, this makes me look forward to the upcoming remastering, as the original albums were great for the time, but they've got that stereo thing down now.<br /><br />So as someone who has played Beatle songs for about 40 years on anything from accordian to banjo, and has been to Liverpool, stood outside their houses, walked down Penny Lane, saw Strawberry Fields, and sang for the locals on the stage at The Cavern, this collection is nicely done, and sounds absoultely lovely in 5.1.  Dude, do the DVD!
B00005NTJM|4.0|I'm in the process of replacing some original (reel-to-reel) recordings from (LP) disk, greatest hits of the 70's. I was looking forward to hearing a clean rendition of my now-hissy and drop-outish Tull tape. <br /> <br />My issue is: the engineering/re-mastering is really terrible! I listened to this album (and Standup) while A-B'ing the sound difference between my old tape and the new clean CD remastering. I was really disappointed in the mixing and engineering, the worst of any albums I've ever once loved and now hear sounding much worse than they should.  <br /> <br />Speaking as audiophile, former recording/audio engineer, 70's DJ, and someone who saw Jethro Tull many times in concerts large and small, I think this CD is missing the guts of their dynamic range; it is \\"thin\\". <br />The flute is mixed way up front and the guitars are mostly pulled back into the woodwork, especially during hot, harmonic duets between the instruments. The midrange is wimpy too... OK, that's from a pure (audio) sound perspective. <br /> <br />Of course anyone who knows (and certainly anyone who loves) Tull and in particular this wonderfully quirky, jazz-oriented album would be happy having this if the cassette or LP record are shot or eaten by the dog. <br />Although I've been on a mission to trim down my huge old collection of tapes, and replace the worst of them with brand new CD's with remastering of the original tracks, in this case the original sounds better even with hiss, to my audiophile ears. Of course it's a great album, both musically and historically.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|It makes me sick to read the negative reviews stating Craig isn't Bond or that any true Bond fan wouldn't like this film because it's different from the rest of them. B.S. Everytime the actor changes Bond is different and not just in how the actor portrays the role. Lazanby was nothing like Connery. His Bond was very drab and laid back, lacking the intensity Connery had. Moore was more witty, sometimes to the point it could be more properly referred to as half-wit. He brought silliness to the Bond franchise that wasn't there before and hasn't been there since. Timothy Dalton was a major change of direction. His Bond was hard edged, much like craig is now, and ruthless. Consequently people that had been used to Moore's portrayal hated Dalton, many still do. Brosnan was like none of them and like all of them at the same time. He tried to hard sometimes to do it all and not be his own Bond at times. Craig is not as sophisticated as Bond of yore. But than again that's the point. this movie is about how he got to the point of sophistication he's at in the other films. To those who can't see beyond what's on screen the next Bond will help build that arch a little more. It's due November of '08.  <br />Every time a new actor took over this role a whole slew of people complain about the new actor not being Bond. Some people just can't get over change. I became a Bond fan when I saw GoldenEye. I had to go back and see the earlier films after seeing the Brosnan Bond. I saw Moonraker next and if any Bond film should be dissed on that one should. The sheer differences between those films didn't disuade me from viewing any other Moore Bond films nor of looking into Connery, Lazenby, and Dalton. I've enjoyed them all, some more than others (i.e. Moonraker) and I expect to continue enjoying these films no matter how much Craig is different from Brosnan.  <br />P.S. Anyone who writes that the movie is boring because it's not wall to wall action and explosions probably has ADD. Those scenes are not boring. At the most they are deliberately paced to establish suspense and intrigue. It's refreshing to see Bond have to figure things out instead of having things just fall into place right in front of him.
B00005JPGO|5.0|This surprisingly well done movie shows us a man with ambition in the wild continent of Africa. It makes us appreciate that we are living in a civilized society and leading a happy life. The great thing about this movie is that it contains some very beautiful, spectacular sceneries which match very well with the characters, who are also in some great pursuits. It makes our ordinary everyday conflicts seem so petty. Unlike many other cartoonish \\"adventure\\" type movies such as Indiana Jones which is fake and therefore only gives us short-term entertainment, this movie feels very realistic and therefore is very moving. <br />
B00005JMYI|1.0|Did not care for this movie at all--kept waiting for it to get better and it never did!  Don't waste your time.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|this movie is very good...it was a little hard to follow in places...the special effects were amazing and the story was great too...it lost points for me when the ending came around, though entertaining and a great 'oooooh' moment, it wasn't well explained, and for an ending like that not to be explained, it lost just an ounce of specialness...good but wierd
006056251X|5.0|It's rare to find a writer who can take you into a world and make you feel such powerful emotions over a story.  I couldn't wait to get this book.  From the moment it arrived in the mail, I consumed it in one night. This book was beyond your typical romance novel.  It was funny, exciting, suspenseful, heartwarming.  I actually had tears well up and that NEVER happens to me.  The scandalous St. Vincent finally meets his match the lovely Evie. And to see him slowly care for someone other than himself, really stirred something inside of me.  Buy the book, you won't be disappointed.   <br /> <br />Looking for other good books?

B000002UAI|5.0|John had the most growth on this album.. (that is of course in my opinion) <br />Songs like No Reply and I'm a Loser are wonderful. The lyrics are so powerful. Lennon's voice coupled with McCartney's harmonizing is great. Harrison's aggressive guitars on No Reply and Ringo's strong back beat make it a great song. John is really on target here. It's a tribute to John's early days with the Beatles.
1400034779|5.0|To read this book is to be transported to a fresh world, to an Africa brimming with a variety of life and customs, to a world rich in character and inner resources.  It is so much more than just a mystery story; it is a window into a different way of looking at life.  Alexander McCall Smith calls forth a country, a countryside, and a people that are unforgettable. <br /> <br />Precious Ramotswe is a woman of enormous common sense and willingness to feel the needs of both herself and other people.  She is a fully-rounded character with an inborn understanding of human nature and an ability to learn from her own mistakes. <br /> <br />This book is one of those little jewels that can move you into a character's soul and give you an understanding of the forces that mold a different way of life. <br /> <br />And it's a really good story, too, with little twists and turns that entertain and delight.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B00005JPP6|4.0|While I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz, it falls well short of Shaun of the Dead. To me, the humor in Hot Fuzz wasn't as funny as the previous film, but the action sure made up for it. This movie also boasts ample gore and a couple of inventive death sequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funny guys and I hope to see them team up many more times in the future.

0618680004|5.0|The arguments in the book are very convincing, and it is difficult to understand, why even educated people cannot (or rather do not want to!) understand them. This is also, why I am afraid, this book will not change the minds of many people: The fundamentalists of all persuasions simply will not open their minds to reason. This would all be well, if they did not try (as in the USA, and many more places) to mold the world according to their views.  <br />
1400063515|5.0|Taleb(T)has written an excellent book that should be required reading for every social scientist who bases his theoretical analysis, empirical work,and applied policy recommendations on the presumed use of the normal probability distribution.The use of the Normal distribution ,usually applied by social scientists,especially economists and psychologists, without any type of goodness of fit test, to their time series data,is the major reason for the predictive and forecast failures that occur with regularity in the social sciences.Taleb's message is that accurate and reliable prediction in the social sciences is not possible because of what Schumpeter called the \\" regular irregularity \\"problem of not being able to know,due to changing expectations,what  the process or mechanism generating the stochastic time series data is.The social data being generated by the interaction of the ever changing mix of relevant social  variables over time is not stable,uniform,and homogeneous over time due to constant financial, social,technological,political, and economic innovation and advance(or obsolescence and decay).Taleb's message is practically identical to the one that John Maynard Keynes delivered to Jan Tinbergen in 1939 and 1940 in their exchange in the Economic Journal over the logical(inductive and analogical) foundations of econometrics.Tinbergen sought to use the method of multiple correlation and regression based on least squares.Unfortunately,least squares is based on the assumption of normality( assume a normal probability distribution).Tinbergen,in his lifetime,never provided a goodness of fit test demonstrating that the time series data was, in fact,normally distributed.       At a much deeper philosophical and epistemological level,T explicitly shows how the social sciences ,over the last 130 years, have failed to grasp the limitations imposed on these fields by Hume's problem of induction.All social sciences have the severe problem that the interactions of human beings with each other in their physical environment constantly creates new combinations of possible outcomes that are not predictable or forseeable.T is correct that this problem is enormous and can't be dealt with by assuming some kind of probability distribution a priori,especially when the generating mechanism for the outcomes is constantly being changed by the very interactions of human decision makers with eachother brought about by reactions to previous forecasts or predictions that may have had some degree of reliability in the past.       I have one minor bone to pick with T.This is T's decision not to explicitly make use of the extremely powerful results presented by Keynes in 1921 in his A Treatise on Probability.Keynes spent all of Part III of this book on Hume's problem of induction and his partial solution in terms of an interval based approach to probability combined with his concept of the weight of the evidence,w.w measures the degree of the completeness of the relevant evidence upon which the probabilities are being calculated.Keynes always sought to differentiate between the highly improbable and the highly uncertain(or highly ambiguous a la Daniel Ellsberg).The highly improbable becomes a severe problem in all social sciences precisely because the weight of the evidence in these fields is relatively  low in general.w must have a weight of 1(w is defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,0<=w<=1) in order to support the claim that the probability distribution has a particular shape(i.e.,a bell shape)that will be applicable in the future.The presumption that the shape is bell shaped rules out BOTH the highly improbable(which Mandelbrot has shown for over 50 years occurs  much more often than would be predicted by a normal distribution)and the highly uncertain or ambiguous.The use of Keynes's TP would have added support to T's sound conclusions.Perhaps he is planning to write another book in this area which would explicitly take Keynes's work intoaccount.      T has demonstrated that the social sciences,particularly economics and psychology, are a mess.These fields assume continuity,independence,and stability,as well as the existence and uniqueness of supposed solutions without providing any empirical/experimental support for such claims.The entire foundation for social science must be rethought.The tool kit presently in use is not correctly measuring and/or describing what is actually occurring.Unfortunately,just as Keynes and Mandelbrot have been rejected,so will Taleb.This is because coming to grips with failure requires that the current practitioners realize that their methodology is not working and decide to change.This is precisely what the dominant academics in these fields refuse to do and will continue to refuse to do.They will simply continue to catalog an exploding number of anomalies that future researchers will supposedly have to deal with.
B00008IHN1|1.0|The storyline and acting in this movie are painful, to say the least. The main character, Devon, is too annoying for words.  <br />The band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melodramatic, and there is no plot line what-so-ever.  <br />I know we can expect these types of movies to stretch reality, but to show the main character begin school at one  <br />University, drop out and transfer to another University, and then return to the first university...all in one semester was absurd.  <br />Have the writers of this movie ever attended a University? Did they do any sort of research for this at all? <br />I would not recommend purchasing or renting this movie. It is not worth the money. If you feel you must see this monstrosity,  <br />I would borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to buy it, pull up the main menu, and go straight to the scenes with the band performances. <br />The whole movie is garbage and a waste of time. <br />
B00000DOYR|4.0|Whenever I'm in a down mood and I want to just blow that downer mood away, I turn to AC-DC's \\"Back In Black\\".  The simplest of song lyrics, with hard-driving beats and hard-driving guitar work and hard-driving drums, this is the thunderstorm of rock weather.  It separates itself from the usual hard-rock by having very catchy melodies and surprisingly crafted studio engineering quality.  Its purpose: to have some really loud, raucous fun.  What is ISN'T: if you're looking to have your nose really rubbed in some genuinely dirty twisted nastiness, you won't get that with this disc.  It also has no quiet nuance; no lilting, breathless, barely audible poetry; no gentle ethereal transcendental softness.  But It Really Rocks.  Women, Alcohol, Rock.  Great Simple Fun.

B0006957SA|5.0|I don't usually review classics- works of literature or music whose greatness is so self-evident and widely acknowledged as to render any acclaim of mine as superfluous, unnecessary and probably inadequate. I mean, what could I possibly say about \\"The Oresteia\\" or \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\" that hasn't been said before and that would do it justice or add to the general enlightenment? Anyway, I usually find that there are more than enough people on amazon.com who feel the need to tell the world that Shakespeare is \\"a great writer\\" or that Mozart's tunes are \\"awesome\\". Such is how I viewed \\"If I Should Fall From Grace of God\\" until I surfed onto the product overview at amazon and saw that only a measly 13 people had seen fit to praise this extraordinary album. So in the interest of promoting incredible music, let me just say that this album is one of the classics. I've seen it on more than one published list of \\"Greatest albums of the 80s\\" or \\"Desert Island albums\\". This is one of those albums which make you sit up and say \\"Wow- I've never heard anything like this before\\", which is what I said when I first heard it in the early 90s. Raucous, poetic, funny, head banging, joyful, beautiful- it is the Pogues' best album and one of the all-time greats.
0446577383|3.0|Mr. Baldacci has constructed another decent summertime read.  Just be prepared to have your suspension of disbelief stretched (believe it or not, compassionate terrorists!) and you'll get to muscle through some truly clunky, clumsy dialogue.  I could give you several examples, but as a general rule, Baldacci uses dialogue as his method of information delivery to the audience, rather than simple explanitory prose:<br /><br />  1)  You'll encounter secret service agents that evidently need to explain the mundane details of their protocols to each other.<br /><br />  2)  You'll hear a clerk at the Library of Congress explain the book viewing process in painstaking detail to a guy who goes there routinely.  The other guy doesn't ask him to hurry up.<br /><br />  3)  You'll meet a muslim woman who articulately explains at length the many wonderful virtues of Islam to a gum-smaking American woman who can barely form a coherent sentance and is distracted by the many infidelities she's about to commit...<br /><br />You may roll your eyes.  Probably more than once.  If eye-rolling isn't your thing, you might just sigh and beg Mr. Baldacci to \\"GET ON WITH IT!\\"<br /><br />There are a good number of interweaving plot lines, but the paper-thin characters can make it very easy to find onesself asking, \\"Who are we talking about again?  Is this the blond guy from the NSA or the brown-haired dude from the CIA or the red-head from the PTA?\\"<br /><br />Please don't expect a whole lot of action prior to Chapter 20.  Or for a few chapters after that.  At least the words are small and clip-clop along at a brisk pace.<br /><br />If all this sounds like your kind of book, then The Camel Club could be worth a guilty-pleasure read.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This CD is an audio remaster of what is already an all-time master. \\"Going for the One\\" is one of the three best LPs from Yes's relatively eclectic collection (I'm sure you know the other two).  That is really saying something if one considers the fact that Yes is arguably the greatest progressive/art rock band that ever existed during this particular incarnation of mankind--with apologies to Pink Floyd and Genesis.  The care put into this particular effort is exemplified by Rick Wakeman's organ parts having been played from a satellite location (a church in Vevay, Switzerland), with the tracks being laid down and recorded in Montreaux.  As for the album cover, I will assume that Yes was attempting to become more accessible to their female fans.
0452282152|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is well-written and researched, very poetic and really - more than anything - compelled me to learn more about the Dutch masters. That said it did not resonate much for me after the reading. While I loved the world and characters depicted by Chevalier, the social constraints borne upon the protagonist did not make for great literature. From my perspective, she was never able to speak her true mind or act on her true desires even to the very last sentence, largely because of her circumstances, her gender, and the era. While I'm sure there were many stretches and risks taken in this story that would require a 17th century Dutch person to suspend their disbelief, making Griet into a credable character of the day just limits too many interesting possibilities because of the way she has to make her choices. I know her constraints were part of the point - being captured in a painting and all - and really this is a small issue. I still would recommend it.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|\\"The Lake House\\" pairs up Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since \\"Speed\\" in what turns out to be a very watchable but unconventional romance.<br /><br />Bullock plays Doctor Kay Forster, who is departing a unique glass cottage on a lake to return to Chicago.  She leaves a note for the next tenant, architect and builder Alex Wyler, played by Reeves.  The two fall into an exchange of letters and it soon becomes apparent, with several humorous touches, that Alex is in the cottage in 2004, while somehow Kay is living in 2006.  The singularity of a time-traveling mailbox outside the cottage is never explained; viewers are advised to accept it as a necessary plot contrivance.  Alex and Kay discover the time difference in an hilarious scene in which the two stand in the same place two years apart, reading and writing a series of notes that are essentially being passed back and forth through the mailbox.<br /><br />The correspondence across time brings two lonely but compatible people together.  Their slowly blossoming romance is complicated in a interesting way by the time difference.  Alex actually has a couple of contacts with the 2004 Kay, who knows nothing yet of Alex or the Lake House and is involved with an obnoxious and disposable boyfriend.  A scene in which the 2006 Kay asks Alex to retrieve a book she lost in 2004 is nicely done; Alex's ultimately successful effort to return the book helps cement their relationship.<br /><br />The desire of the 2004 Alex and the 2006 Kay to meet face to face begins to drive the story.  A date with Kay arranged two years in advance by Alex fails, heartbreakingly, when Alex fails to appear.  At this point, a fatal accident that Kay witnessed at the start of her medical residency in 2004 begins to overshadow the story.  Kay must use her knowledge of the future to somehow change the past.  The dramatic ending of the movie makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />The Glass House on the lake is a fascinating structure in and of itself; unfortunately, we never get a really good look at it.  Christopher Plummer has an outstanding cameo as Alex's father, a famous architect who built the Glass House before essentially abandoning his family.  Shohreh Aghdashloo is outstanding as Kay's medical mentor, who in one of several loop-backs in the movie also treats Alex's dying father.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to viewers looking for a romantic movie featuring two leads with real onscreen chemistry; those who obsess over the time-traveling wrinkles of the plot are likely to miss the best of the story.ure in and of itself; unfortunately, we never get a really good look at it.

0634049011|5.0|This book has been great. It's not one of those \\"I have all the answers. You are bad at guitar, and this is how to play correctly.\\" It's a very friendly and simple book. It essentially makes you learn from VERY basic (yes, I admit, I flew by a good number of chapters at the first) to the little particular things that I had never really noticed before. This book makes you think. It makes you look at the fretboard differently, which is a GOOD thing. It makes you take all the knowledge of scales and intervals, chords and notes and it pounds it in your brain like no other. A GREAT buy for guitar students (listen up guitar teachers! this could really help a student!) and anyone who wants to explore the fretboard a little more. Thanks, Amazon!

B000N3ST9I|5.0|Nowadays, it seems like just about every modern-metal band is trying desperately to escape being tagged \\"metalcore\\" (a genre that is supposedly on its way out). Most haven't yet succeeded in doing so, but to some bands, \\"metalcore\\" is nothing more than a quickly fading object in their rear-view mirror.<br /><br />After releasing their debut, \\"Burn My Eyes\\" (which is groove/post-metal landmark), in 1994, Machine Head began experimenting with their sound by releasing a series of mediocre and uneven albums which were substantially softer, and even arguably nu-metal-ish. As a result, the band lost a large part of their fanbase. But then, in 2004, they stormed back onto the scene with a triumphant return to form, \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires.\\" Unfortunately, heavy metal (and the metalcore genre, in particular) was at the peak of its popularity that year, so some fans thought of \\"Ashes\\" as just a trend jump. But now, three years after that, the Oakland-based quartet have released their sixth studio effort, \\"The Blackening,\\" an album that leaves mere \\"metalcore\\" and \\"groove metal\\" in the dust. In fact, throw out all of the categories, because Machine Head are now in a class by themselves.<br /><br />\\"The Blackening\\" sounds like a mix of old and new. Frontman Rob Flynn (who was once in a Nineties thrash band called Vio-lence) draws a bit from his own past by filling these songs with intense tempos, excellent riffs, and killer solos which evoke the Bay Area's glory days. Plus, \\"The Blackening\\" recaptures much of the same raw energy, emotion, visceral impact, and iron-fisted aggression as 2004's \\"Through The Ashes Of Empires.\\" But in no way is this just a simple throwback album, because it expands a great deal on Machine Head's sound, musicianship, and songwriting skills. T hese songs are friggin' epics -- they range from just under five minutes to over ten and a half minutes long, and are, musically, a lot more complex, meticulous, and multi-faceted than anything MH have ever attempted. (Flynn plays a big part in the band's growth by frequently showing off his surprisingly strong singing voice and intelligent, inspiring, often politically-charged lyrics.)<br /><br />Every track on this record is a winner; it's darn near impossible to find a single dud or weak moment anywhere on here. Whether opting for brutal and straightforward or more restrained and slowly-building songs, Machine Head almost always make sure the music bristles with intensity and unpredictability. Opener \\"Clenching The Fists of Dissent\\" begins quietly and slowly, with mysterious acoustic guitar strums, but in not too long, a breakneck tempo change kicks in, launching the listener into a river of furious riffing. The guitarists (Phil Demmel and the above-mentioned Rob Flynn) toss in a pair of superbly ripping solos near the end, too. Then, an explosive barrage of thick, hefty, churning guitars and hard-hitting drums back Flynn while he bellows \\"F you all!\\" from his gut, thus signifying the made-for-moshing beginning of \\"Beautiful Morning.\\" The next track, \\"Aesthetics of Hate,\\" boasts a quick, bouncy drum beat, and a wealth of great guitar melodies and harmonies (including a fairly long solo section), before ending with a dark and spine-tingling spoken-word passage where Flynn repeats \\"May the hand of God strike them down\\" several times. \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\" is also of note for it lyrical content because it is a livid tirade against a journalist who wrote an insulting article about Pantera/Damageplan guitarist \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott only a week after his tragic murder in 2004.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\" and \\"A Farewell To Arms\\" both have quite a bit of clean, proper singing (in fact, the latter track even features some supple, even borderline-sweet crooning), thus making them probably the record's two most melodic and restrained cuts. \\"Slanderous\\" and \\"Halo\\" are also of note because they sport heavy, propulsive riffs, catchy, adherent grooves, and wailing solos. And, lastly, track seven, \\"Wolves,\\" takes the cake for being \\"The Blackening\\"'s biggest highlight. This song is over nine-minutes of sheer awesomeness! Most of it is super fast and heavy (with an absolutely blistering thrash guitar lead, deft, thumping drums, and four wild, careening solos); but somehow, the song also always manages to be super catchy, and it includes a very memorable and powerful chorus (\\"Unleash the wolves!\\") that ranks right up there in greatness with the chorus from \\"Davidian\\" (the world-renowned first track on 1994's \\"Burn Your Eyes\\").<br /><br />\\"The Blackening\\" is an opus that practically has \\"greatness\\" written all over it, and all metalheads should fall in love with it very quickly. In addition to being the best heavy music release of 2007 thus far, this album is doubtlessly MH's most godly, epic, masterful, brilliant, intricate, expansive, exhilarating, and realized work to date. It silences every doubt and answers every question skeptics have ever had about Machine Head. Yes, they are still relevant; yes, they are still inspired; yes, they can still shred almost anybody's musical pants off; and yes, they are still fully capable of making a killer album that is sure to go down in history as a classic.

055358202X|2.0|I absolutely loved books 1 through 3. In fact, at one point, I thought they were better than Jordan's Wheel of Time. But I can't finish this book IV; I'm ending the adventure on page 376. If I was to summarize what has happened so far I don't think there would be a spoiler in the lot. Whilst something may happen in the remaining ~300 pages the burden of reading through to it is too onerous.  <br /> <br />It has been a struggle to wade through the lengthy descriptions, the numerous characters and the lack of any real action. The appendix contains 65 pages of \\"who's who\\"; the book is a real alphabet soup of characters - many of whom add nothing to the plot. I simply could not keep up with the characters - those of you with a good memory may have a more enjoyable time with the book. <br /> <br />The book needs a proper editing to reduce the redundancy. There are repetitive references to Brienne being freakish and ugly, Cersei hating the Imp, etc. For redundancy I would have much preferred a little intro summarizing where book III left off (in fairness, there are some references to past intrigue peppered throughout Book IV). <br /> <br />Cersei's scheming is an enjoyable read but its disappointing that she and Tyrion (the Imp) will not be duking it out in this book. GRRM said he wants to \\"tell all the story for half the characters\\". If true, that implies we won't see Cersei and Tyrion together in the next book either. Pity. <br />
0066620996|1.0|This book is dangerous.  The principle of looking for the right people to put on the bus and to put the right people in the right seats is horrible.  This philosophy lends itself to homogenizing the workforce, and only looking for people who \\"look like us and think like us\\"  This does not allow for individual peersonalities which brings fresh approaces to problem.  This it the perfect formula for an autocratic control-freak of a CEO.  I know the book also says that people in companies can argue and heatedly exchange ideas, but with the \\"get on the bus\\" theory, there is no way that alternate ideas would be tolerated for very long.  This is the kind of thinking that has gotten us into iraq. <br /> <br />Buy as many of these books as you can afford and burn every one of them.

Don't expect to \\"get\\" this movie the first time,you'll need to watch it a few times. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job as the strange unadjusted Donnie Darko, a teenager who may be crazy or is just caught in some kind of time loop. The realization at the end that he was able to change the future is powerful indeed. Solid acting by all cast and a few nice cameos, make this a highly recomended film.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This was one of the most original and creative screenplays I have seen in a very long time, yet it is really just an updated Greek Tragedy.  Here we have Will Ferrell playing the generic everyman.  He has no life, no direction, and no goal.  This is a morality play where Ferrell shows character and integrity and eventually heroism.  Emma Thompson in a voice over performs as the Greek Chorus and then as the Author she plays the Goddess who uses Ferrell as a pawn.  Dustin Hoffman plays another God who reviews Ferrell's pleas for mercy and help but decides that Ferrell must die because his death would be glorious.  In the meantime the Goddess gives Ferrell the future and love that he desires but like in any Greek Tragedy the Gods raise up those whom they would destroy so Ferrell's fate is sealed.  However, like Hector he is given the choice to avoid his fate or to be the Hero and die a hero's death.  At the end we are told that the man (like Hector) who knows he is going to die but still does his duty is truly a hero.<br /><br />This is an excellent film.  It is unusual and has a few semi-funny scenes but it isn't a comedy but then is the death of a true hero a tragedy?  I think this was a very good film and I recommend it highly.  It would be a good teaching aid for anyone wanting to show how a Greek Play is constructed using modern techniques.
B000FILW86|5.0|...and, I should add, even occasionaly moving.  NPR's Ken Tucker raved about this last year.  He was absolutely right.  If you gave up on them after Heaven Tonight (um...guilty), now's the time to rediscover how good Cheap Trick can be.  Honestly, there's more fun and aural pyrotechnics here than all of their previous releases, and that includes Budokan.    They're CT, but somehow MORE than CT.  At one point in \\"If It Takes A Lifetime\\", Rick Neilson (who is my new guitar hero) sounds just as buried, fuzzed, and overwhelmingly mesmerizing as Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine.  Neilson, who wouldn't know a pretentious guitar solo if it leapt up and bit him, nevertheless plays shivery hooks underpinning each tune.  And Robin Zander's voice is miraculous.  They simply CAN'T have released Heaven Tonight 30 years ago.      They still have the humor and moxie to write a song about monogamy and play it loud, fast, and Old Cheap Trick (\\"Don't Give It Away\\").  Or to admit that the Life  wasn't all roses in the genuinely wistful \\"All Those Years\\" (\\"It's a lonely life, a lonely lonely life\\").  And it's a mystery to me why the cyclical 50's-influenced \\"Every Night and Every Day\\" wasn't the single, especially with Neilson's urgent, chopped guitar smashing through the pretty tune.  It's edgier than it first appears, and massively addictive.  But it's the chorus from \\"This Time We Got It\\"--all garage-band jangling and cocksure fun--that will make you thrilled you're alive and singing along.  The dirty, delightful truth is that, regardless of genre, this is the best thing I've bought this year.

I'm glad that I just checked for the hardcover and yippeee...the price is reduced. All in all, this is very much appreciated. Thank you Rhonda Byrne.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Unbelievable. Amazon really needs to update their rating possibilities from 5 stars to 10, because 5 doesnt do this album justice. I've followed PT for a long time now, constantly admiring their growth from album to album and the fantastic musicianship throughout. I've met Steven Wilson and the fellas from PT several times, and I knew this album was gona be fantastic, but I had no idea just how powerful it would be. Anesthetize in particular is probably the best song Porcupine Tree have ever written, alonside Arriving Somewhere But Not Here. In the times we live in, especially with the recent tragedy at Virginia Tech, this album's themes resonate even more. Every song is solid, the album flows beautifully and the writing is fantastic. Pick it up and experience one of the finest albums of our time.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I was never a huge fan of MCR.  Three Cheers had several catchy interesting songs, but other than maybe 4 or 5 good songs, was mostly filler.  However, \\"The Black Parade\\" is a much different story.  MCR has matured and evolved so much over the past several years.  The songs on the album flow so well together and there is no weak point on the album.  Perhaps it is because the entire album is focused around a single theme.  Whatever it is, this album will not dissapoint.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|\\"And the performances! It doesn't get any better than Hugo Weaving as V, in my opinion. He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor. There are not a great many other actors who can emote that much feeling even sans masks! And his voice! It sends chills through me every time I hear it. I truly fell in love with V.  <br /> <br />Natalie Portman is magnificent as well. She is so beautiful and a natural actress. Her accent could have been a bit better, but only a bit. Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.\\" <br /> <br />***Hugo Weaving is magnificent. And I must agree with the aforementioned poster. He wove you into his pain and the love he had for Evey. It is a love story in the same vein as Phantom of the Opera. You yearn for them to be able to share their feelings, but you know it to be impossible. Both are a most underestimated actors.
B000MVQ9P2|5.0|THE HOST (original Korean title GWOEMUL) is a sneakily good film which was a hit in Cannes. Be aware that it contains an environmental message that isn't exactly subliminal and that, also, it shows the U.S. in a very dim light. Nevertheless, I easily got past all that and was soon very immersed in the movie. I really don't know how this film got past my movie radar, but thank goodness it did. I went into this not knowing much about it other than it was ostensibly a creature feature. But it's so much more than that. THE HOST manages to integrate a strong family theme, an off the wall sense of fun, and an unpredictable, heartbreaking storyline which kept me on the edge of my seat. I truly did not know what would happen next, and that's a very good thing. As a bonus, this movie is also pretty funny.<br /><br />It starts out in a U.S. Army Base morgue in Korea when an American lab technician has his lackey dump formaldehyde down the laboratory drains even though he knows that the toxic stuff will eventually flow into the Han River. Some years later, frequenters on the banks of the Han River witness a grotesque monstrosity shockingly emerge from the river and begin an all out rampage. Survivors of the attack are summarily rounded up by the government which, fearing a creature-initiated virus, then institutes a quarantine and hastily begins conducting tests on the parties involved.<br /><br />One particularly contentious family is very much involved in the doings. Held under quarantine, they are grieving the death of a 13-year-old girl named Hyum-seo, who was seen being carried away by the monster. Her father, the dim-witted Gang-du, receives a call on a cell from someone claiming to be Hyum-seo and that she's alive but being held captive in a hole under a bridge. Gang-du and his kin break away from quarantine and flee into the sewer system and begin their search for Hyum-seo.<br /><br />Meanwhile, time is running out for the girl Hyum-seo. With lack of food and drink and imprisoned in a deep chasm, she glimpses no prospects for the future as she awaits her turn to become nourishment for the creature. A further burden is laid on her shoulders when another survivor, this time a little boy, appears. At last, with hope dwindling faster and faster, she seizes on one opportunity for escape.<br /><br />Yes, the star of the film is the beastie itself. But THE HOST focuses more on the quarrelling family members than on the monster, and this works to the film's advantage as we get the chance to know the characters and invest in what happens to them. The dysfunction in this family is never more strongly portrayed than in an early scene where they remain hilariously combative even as they mourn the supposed death of young Hyum-seo. This film goes on to underline the power of kinship and how familial loyalties can overcome personal differences.<br /><br />The monster is part squid, part tadpole, and part f*ck-all. It shows up sporadically, which serves to heighten the suspense and enhance its effectiveness. Its debut appearance is a freakin' doozy, done in broad daylight with its raging man attack taking place out in the open. The sequence carried a surreal note as I just wasn't used to these kinds of perfidy not occuring in the depths of night and in enclosed spaces. The monster, when it does have screen time, gallumps prodigiously, its pace denoting an intensity and a certain inevitability. There's a fluid grace and ease in the manner it transports itself across the various bridge undercarriages and the dexterity in which it scales sleek walls. It's darn impressive and mostly convincing. So, well done to the film's CG department.<br /><br />THE HOST sows a lot of seeds: it subverts the monster horror genre and remains mostly unpredictable. Every so often it'll unleash moments of wicked slapstick humor and, later on, sober us up with scenes of utter poignancy. Oh, yes, it also calls out the U.S. military (Agent Yellow? I could see it). The scenes with the monster are pretty darn spectacular. When watching THE HOST, be prepared to be unsettled and invigorated. You might even end up feeling sad. Be that as it may, THE HOST gets five formaldehyde-polluted stars from me.nes with the monster are pretty darn spectacular. When watching THE HOST, be prepared to be unsettled and invigorated.

1844137864|5.0|Today, Banksy has become one of the most prolific graffiti artists in the world, striking large sponsorship deals from companies and rich celebrities alike. His work is usually more on the simple side, yet its message can be puzzling, complicated or sometimes just hard to accept despite the truth behind it. He is a modern day genius using a media not recognized or admired by all yet applicable to all at the same time. The thing I love about this book though, is not just that it showcases his work-but it shows where he got his inspiration from. Following the few most influential snippets of his life from being expelled at 9 to making his first piece in his late teens, it shows how he came to use the mediums he is so successful with today and also shows how he has thought of the ideas and concepts he has about society demonstrated in his work. Though it doesn't show much, the captions, the small pieces of text give all of us an insight into the mind of a genius-and that is what makes this book a five star book, not that it shows the genius through the work, but where that genius has come from.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|As a university student that has spent some time looking at both sides of the envioronmental (global warming debate) I have to say that this is a VERY POOR documentary.  I cannot believe it got an Oscar.  The imagery may be convincing, and Al Gore is very passionate about this topic.. but disappointingly, he has used the very same tactics that the people on the opposite side of the argument have used...  misleading video footage coupled with alarmist statements.. and all to make a buck.  Don't forget for one instant that there is a LOT of money to be made on either side of this argument.  Non-biased scientific opinion is very hard to come by in relation to global warming, and believe me, many of the so-called 'facts' that Gore informs us of, are in fact questionable at best.   <br /> <br />By no means am I saying that our planet has been treated well by human beings, but I advise everyone to refrain from panic and jumping on the bandwagon.  Do your best to protect the environment in your own way... but think about this one fact that was conveniently left out of \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\".  At certain stages in the Earth's geological history, there was twice the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as there is today.. and the temperature was LOWER.  Ask Al to explain that one... I don't think he will though.. his alarmist global warming graphical examples wouldn't hold nearly as much convincing power as they do on first appearance..   <br /> <br />It is so disappointing that someone like Gore couldn't have given us the REAL story.. instead of making a fool out of himself trying to gain attention... The poor guy should have been President, then he wouldn't have had time to run around scare-mongering..
B00006HAZG|5.0|By enlarge, a refreshing aspect of this film is the quality of acting and the casting for the parts of Dickens characters. Daniel Radcliffe (of Harry Potter fame) does a good job of young David Copperfield, seeming to bring the innocence and mistrust to the boy who hopes for a better future. Maggie Smith does a superb job of playing David's aunt, Betsey Trotwood, capturing the dimensionality expected of a character who first rejects, then accepts David into her life.     The film exemplifies the mood of Dickens' work. David endures quite a troublesome and painful existence as a child, either being neglected or treated maliciously by his cold, callus stepfather, Mr. Murdstone. After David also has difficulties in school, and then is robbed and left penniless, he takes a chance on his aunt for help. There is a wonderful scene where Betsey has a confrontation with Murdstone, who is trying to gain custody of David, and ends up telling him to leave.     There are other characters who represent bright spots in David's life, such as Clara Peggotty (David's nanny), Mr. Peggotty, Mr. Micawber, and David's true love, Agnes Wickfield. Agnes represents a true soul for David's troubled life, as she listens to David's concerns and is always there for him in his times of desperation, even while he is married to the child-like Dora.     A prevalent aspect of Dickens-based works is the idea that those who have difficult stations in life can rise up to bigger and better things if they struggle along and find their way. We see this subject captured in David Copperfield, and the bitter aspects of his life are all a part of the journey to overcoming, and having hope for the future.     If there is one beef with this film, it is the pacing. As one reviewer mentioned, the second part of the film tends to wane a little, and doesn't quite have the same impact as the first half. Still, this doesn't take away from the over all impact of the film.     Dickens once said that, of all novels, David Copperfield was his \\"child,\\" because it was close to home, and nearest to his life. I think he would be satisfied with this film effort. I think you will too!
B000003H34|4.0|Anathema are an excellent band. I can't understand some of these nasty reviews. If you don't like the music fine, but damn relax. Anyway, this is a strong Doom album. The lyrics and the \\"Floydian\\" vibe make this very cohesive. If you really want to know about the Doom metal genre, \\"The Silent Enigma\\" is/was a very important statement. Take the time, appreciate what this is and you will be rewarded. If you have to force yourself, then you don't understand \\"early\\" Doom.
B00005NW02|5.0|I happened upon this album because I heard \\"Sugar\\" (or whatever that song is called) played on KROQ and my musical tastes changed forever. The album is a revolutionary breakthrough in musical expression, combining the experimentation of greats like Frank Zappa with the melodic ability of Nat King Cole. The mind-force that created this music (the collective apparatus that is the intellectual force behind System) is absolute genius. Every grunt, note, sound effect and scream is perfectly woven into the fabric that assaults the ears.<br /><br />I have friends who hate this album as they cannot get past the staccato resonance of some of the more popular songs, but in my humble opinion, these only add to the total experience that is Toxicity. This may well be System's masterpiece - although we can hope they find ways to outdo themselves in the future. The Bonus DVD was a nice surprise and at the time of my purchase it was available at the same price.

B000000OQF|5.0|\\"A candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long.\\" Such is the case of GnR. This is one of the most important debut albums of rock and roll. It came at a time when \\"Rock\\" (for lack of a better description of what was being crammed down our throats at the time) was \\"safe\\" (weak, over-produced...). It was around 1987 and someone let loose a piranha in the kiddie pool, and it proceeded to tear to shreds anything and everything in the process, including the pool. Hair bands like Poison and Ratt had ruled the day prior to the release of this album, with their melodic pretty-boy/breast envy vacuous songs about who-can-remember-what. Appetite changed that forever, and reminded us once again that Rock was meant to be dirty, ragged, and wild (as in untamed). This album has teeth - and it likes to bite.<br /><br />Appetite was too violent for most \\"Rock\\" stations, so it was relegated to off-beat locales such as \\"The Krusher\\" (KRSR), a short-lived AM station in Las Vegas, who would play almost every track from the album long before the \\"Rock\\" stations would ever play a sanitized version of Welcome to the Jungle or Sweet Child of Mine. This album created more than an epic band. It created a new way of seeing rock, opening doors for much later acts as System of a Down. The tragic end of GnR was mostly an internal thing that happened long after this magnificent album, and had to do with the emergence of the Seattle sound. But for a brief period of time we had an L.A. \\"rock band that actually rocked.
0743496728|5.0|At first I thought all the journal-like pages (all in the same font) were written by Peter.  But when I read the words that Josie seemed to write and then hid her notebook between the mattress and the bedspring when her mother was coming, and compared those words to the ones that preceeded that chapter, and they were exactly the same.......I began to think that Josie wrote the entries.  After going back and looking at all of them again, I concluded that at least that one was written by Josie, but most were written by Peter.<br /><br />I had to read a few pages and put the book down, then wait to pick it up again, because I thought it was so intense.  I do like this author's style, it's very readable. Looking forward to the next one!  Mary

B000O178BY|5.0|Although I hadn't followed the extremely elaborate and horrifyingly creative marketing behind this album, when I heard that Trent was going to put out a new album in such a short amount of time after the release of \\"With Teeth\\" (well, short by NIN standards), I immediately got excited.  I've been a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails for a long time and Reznor had never disappointed me.  Even though I didn't think \\"With Teeth\\" was his best effort, I had a feeling it was leading up to something even bigger than the fans and even Reznor could have ever imagined.  And that is this supreme entity that is \\"Year Zero.\\"  I cannot tell you how many times I've listened to this entire album, as I have lost count.  Trust me, I'm sure it's in the hundreds somewhere.<br /><br />\\"Year Zero\\" being a conceptual album tells the story of a very bleak and ultimately hopeless America in the future where power and greed has overtaken the country, the government is in control of everyone and everything, and not only that, a sort of \\"presence\\" from another world, another universe has given us a stern warning to change our ways or face our terrible annihilation.  While the album does tell a story, gives us different perspectives and such, it still works as a full length album that's enjoyable to listen to all the way through even if you don't pick up on all of that from the start.<br /><br />It's really hard to put in words what an impression this album has left on me, but I'll do my best.  After hearing this album, it now becomes clear and it seems like all the other past albums were leading up to this moment.  I think Trent knew all along he would make this album, it was just a question of time.  The music and the lyrics are hypnotically stunning and Reznor's still got it as far as vocals are concerned.  There are verses and choruses that will stay with you and refuse to get out of your head, especially the last haunting chorus in \\"zero-sum.\\"<br /><br />This is really an album that you want to listen to all the way through every single time.  Sure, there are songs that are my favorites, but the experience comes from listening to the entire thing.  It's rare when I want to do that, and also listen to it in the exact order that it's presented.  My favorites are \\"the beginning of the end,\\" \\"survivalism,\\" \\"the good soldier,\\" \\"capital g,\\" \\"the warning,\\" \\"in this twilight,\\" and \\"zero-sum.\\"  Again, I love the entire album, but those are my favorites.<br /><br />Just keep this in mind, if you're expecting another \\"Downward Spiral,\\" you will be disappointed.  Know why?  Because \\"Year Zero\\" sounds like \\"Year Zero.\\"  It's a different entity from the other past efforts.  Also, this is one that requires multiple listens as you'll pick up something new each time.  So, make sure you listen to it a bunch of times all the way through before you make your decision.  It's not meant to be an instant hit, although it was for me.  Instant hits get forgotten quickly.  \\"Year Zero\\" will go down as one of those classic albums that everybody talks about, and I truly believe in that.  Mellow, loud, noisy, quiet and shockingly deep, Reznor has put out a superb masterpiece, and after many listens I can safely say that \\"Year Zero\\" is by far my favorite Nine Inch Nails album.  -Michael Craneough every single time.

B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido is one of the few singer/song writers that always leaves you wanting more. Her songs are like poetry made especially for you. I have been a fan of hers since I heard Here with Me on Roswell. I wasn't a fan of her music videos and I waited soo long for the 2nd album. I loved it. Every emotion I have ever felt was written into the songs with perfection. I searched for when a third album would be released and I saw that this special edition dvd was coming out. As always I went to Best Buy before they opened to be sure to get a copy.<br /><br />The dvd showed what a real talent she is. Dressed modestly and ready to share her songs with London she takes the crowd's breath away. One of the best things about this dvd is that she gives a little bit of info on each song. Like for instance Don't Leave Home is not a love ballad. It's a song about addiction. She says that some people play this song at their wedding and she laughs about it. I would too, knowing that. And Mary's in India is about a real friend who traveled. And she experienced some trouble with the release on White Flag because it's about her relationship ending.<br /><br />Dido's voice is soothing and she just appears to be a real person with real problems and to cope with it all she writes songs and it just so happens that she's good at it. The camera angles are great cause they center on her and it's not a big production- it's like you have the front row to a great concert.<br /><br />I don't know a single person who says \\"I don't like Dido's music\\" after they listen to her albums. It's impossible. When someone close to me died I listened to See the Sun over and over. The words made me feel not alone.<br /><br />The dvd also comes with a live cd. This is great because the live performance of See You When You're 40 is played with a great intensity and it's much better live. This dvd is great and if you love Dido's music you must see her perform. It is a treat. She doesn't do a lot of touring here in the U.S. so this is as good as seeing her in person.re in the U.S. so this is as good as seeing her in person.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|Beyond Speechless.....(Thats Not A Good Thing). Ok this album is getting TRASHED!!!! And i totally understand why everyones frustrated. But its not as bad as everyone says it is. The 1st thing is Gwen Stefani hasnt been a solo artist for over 2 decades. So she really doesnt have the right to release an album like this. I can understand if you are Cher or Madonna & you have had many hits back to back & then you reach a point in your career where no one is interested in you anymore and you start to experiment with your sound and you create a couple of dud albums before making an album somewhere in between thats really creative & catchy that everyone likes which will get you back in the spotlight. For Madonna that was Ray of Light & for Cher that was Believe. This album is the album thats considered a DUD & falls right in that category where you've been singing for 2 decades & have nothing left. Gwen really does try different things on this album and most of the experimental stuff is an acquired taste which i have still yet to acquire after hearing this album a few times. The album is not as bad as everyone says it is. Its a COMMERCIAL album by a COMMERCIAL artist. So with an album like this you already know you can usually expect 4 or 5 good to decent songs out of a 12 track release. Just like Beyonce & Christina Aguilera or any other commercial artist you can pretty much expect only 40%-50% of the album to be good. Its very rare that every track on an album is GREAT. There are about 4 to 5 good songs on here. Nothing groundbreaking but the most STAND OUT track on the album is the 2nd single and the name of the album \\"The Sweet Escape\\". That really is the most catchy ADDICTIVE pop track that she has on the album. Gwen pretty much knows that THE SWEET ESCAPE is the only stand out song on here so i can see why she named the album after it. The song reminds of the summer time alot & falls under the IT SONG of the summer of 2007. The rest of the dud tracks are really an acquired taste. And she is working with the NEPTUNES on alot of the tracks for this album. Gwen sounds VANILLA she is not a CHOCOLATE girl so when shes singing on a Neptunes track it just seems half done. I like it when an artist can do alittle bit of everything from Rock, To Pop, to R&B. But she just doesnt quite deliver the goods on those tracks. Honestly every song she has produced by the NEPTUNES is TRASH. Like someone else said i really dont care 4 the 1st single. Its complete GARBAGE. If the 2nd single released had been the 1st single i am sure this album would of went PLATNIUM 5 times already. But it wasnt and you can probably blame the record label for that. The other good songs she has are the ones she writes with Tony Kanal her x boyfriend from No Doubt. Besides the amazing stand out 2nd single here are the other good tracks Early Winter, 4 In The Morning, Fluorscent, Dont Get It Twisted, and Wonderful Life. To be quite honest almost every dud track on this album sounds like songs that were cut from her 1st album & she decided to release it on this 2nd album because the studio forced her to. I can see after the success of the 1st album you would want 2 strike while the IRONS HOT. The 1st album wasnt even that GREAT. But Gwen had a baby & i am sure she really didnt have time to curn out another chart topper nor was she in the mood. You can almost feel that she didnt want to do this album when you hear her sing. This album really doesnt have any direction because Gwen tries so many different things & what she does with the NEPTUNES is just AWFUL. Thats all i have to say. Hopefully her 3rd album will be far superior then this mess of a mix up.cquired taste. And she is working with the NEPTUNES on alot of the tracks for this album.

B000O179FE|5.0|This movie is very slow, but if you have an attention span I think you will love it too. This is a fantastic film that I'm sure will look amazing in HD.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|This album is no Funeral. And, for that, I am glad. I enjoyed parts of Funeral immensely (Neighborhood #1 & 3, and Rebellion [Lies]) but others were too avant-garde for my tastes.  <br /> <br />I rarely watch SNL anymore, but a couple of weeks ago, I tuned in long enough to see the Arcade Fire's performance of \\"Intervention\\". I was blown away. I'd heard the single previously on Satellite radio and downlowaded it almost immediately. It is a powerful and soaring song full of conflicting emotion. I couldn't imagine that the sound of that song could be recreated live but, they pulled it off. I was so impressed that I- still somewhat reluctantly- plunked down the $13 and purchased the album. After the second listen, I decided that I would have paid twice that, just to rent it for a week. Neon Bible is a fantastic accomplishment that surpasses, if not ecplipses, Funeral. <br /> <br />Neon Bible is more melodic and more lyrically accessible than Funeral but no less adventurous musically. Neon Bible is a pulsing, throbbing album of momentous beauty, dark overtones, and spiritual undertones. The entire album is strong- there's no filler here. In the age of the iTunes single, it's getting harder to sink the money into the risky investment of a complete CD album. This album is paying off in spades.   <br /> <br />Win Butler is a good singer. At times his voice is remminiscent of Bruce Springsteen (Butler- unlike the Killers' Brandon Flowers- can pull it off) but it is distinct and appealing in its own right. On \\"Keep the Car Running\\", he even illicits comparisons to John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band's vocals from \\"On the Dark Side\\" (On the record, I believe I am the first person ever to make this comparison!) The periodic female backing vocals are pretty and only add to the composition. <br /> <br />Musically, the Arcade Fire employs an arsenal (go Gunners!) of instruments. The multi-hued, multilayered sound that the band produces is simply awe inspiring. It is rich, deep, and propulsive.  <br /> <br />Neon Bible made a believer out of me!
B00080ZG10|5.0|Wow.... just got done watch the Aviator, and that is one word I can absolutely describe the movie.  The picture/scenes, for a minute I thought I was watching HD, but it was only 420p.  I had to rub my eyes because I thought I was robbing HD :).  Anyways, this movie by far, on a scale of 1 to 10.  This movie is hmmm let me think a second, forget it, it breaks the SCALE! I couldn't believe my eyes through out the whole movie.  Leo playing Howard, and here I thought he did an amazing job (which he did) in Blood Diamonds, but WOW!! Leo did an unbelievable acting job.  At times, I was like, this is Howard Hughes!!  Wow!  The determination of Howard.  The passion of Howard.  The unwilling to give up on his Goal!  Leo definitely brought out in Howard! It was shear entertainment!  RENT ATLEAST!  Just get to know Howard through Leo!  But not be everything accurate of Howard, but you get the gist.  I bought it and it was well spent, for $4? Come on!  I just robbed someone!  It was a great bargain!!  I would give this movie 10 stars, 20 stars, no amount of stars would justify how great this movie was overall.  I am impressed with the man that is called \\"Mr. Howard.\\"  The rest of the cast was just as good.... but Leo, wow, I felt like it was a one man show and it was him trying to let me to get to know who Mr. Howard was.  And his eccentrics, felt so sorry for him especially at the end all naked with a bunch of tissue warzone.  It undoubtablely (if thats even a word) the movie one have to watch.  Great Job, Leo, might of not won an Oscar, but you definitely deserve an ovation of a great performance!  RENT THIS MOVIE! OR BUY IT!  Either way . . . you WIN!!!! :)

1582701709|5.0|This book showcases the Law of Attraction in a very interesting way.  This book should appeal to a broad base of people who are interested in finding a way to be more successful or more wealthy.  It goes no to talk about the haves and the have nots in this world.  An elemental book that is the talking point for a metaphysical shift in perspective. <br />
B00005J6UP|5.0|Great movie by Spielberg. He should be proud of his great career in directing and producing. How he's the main man at it!! Best I've seen and he shows it with this which is one of his best along with Jaws, ET, Shindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Indian Jones, Jurassic Park, and much much more of his best. I don't know. His movies of today are kind of becoming a little bit of a blunder, like War of the Worlds, and The Terminal. But they were great at some scenes, but still they're not his best. Steven might be going a little downhill with his movies, because probably he's running low on ideas and most of them have already been done. But, PLEASE!!! Everyone Do not attempt to remake any of his classics. They are meant to be done once and be the best forever. Like if Jaws is done again it will be a load of garbage. I know it!!! <br />Anyway this movie is great!! I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to relive the retro 80's and for anyone especially who grew up on this movie and hasn't seen it for such a long time. Watch it!! It will bring you back to the 80's. FLASHBACK!!!
0143038419|5.0|Many people never have the gumption to set out in search of themselves - not for any other reason than because they are afraid of what they might find.  I loved this book for her bravery, for her honesty about what was going on inside - not an easy thing to be in touch with much less express - and her light-heartedness.  I finished this book with a MAJOR \\"ah-hah\\" of my own - about myself - that I may not have discovered on my own for YEARS.  This is an excellent book about one person's journey and that journey is one we all at some point embark on - even if we don't do it until we're about to croak.    Those who didn't like the book so much that they needed to trash it are those people.  They're caught up so much in their so-called lives that they can't perceive that life does not have to be about the mundane Soccer Mom routine - unless that's the only way you know to live.    That wasn't my choice - and it wasn't Liz Gilbert's.  It's not that we are selfish, but wise enough to know what makes us happy and at peace as opposed to sloughing through a miserable life because that's what your family did and what your friends do and what the people we build statues of did, too.    Good luck with that.
B00005JPCF|5.0|I cannot say enough about this cute movie!!! What a great message for not only little kids but for everyone! The world needs our help. However, when that little penguin hatches from his egg or encounters the gulls...he makes me smile from the inside out! I watch those scenes at least five times a day. Buy this movie! You and your kids will love it!!
6305388458|4.0|On a friend's strong recommendation, I just got done viewing the Life of Brian.  I am glad I did.  He had raved about how funny the movie is, so I finally relented and gave it a try.  There are many laugh out loud moments in this film.  Very witty and smart dialogue, and satirical looks at the way people donduct themselves when in a large group of people.  From Brian's \\"mom\\" to the song that closes the movie, this film boasts some sheer hilarity.  I enjoy smart films, even when the smart is in the form of satire.  A movie like the Lif of Brian further illustrates how mediocre many of the new Hollywood comedies are (Talladega Nights, R.V., etc.).<br /><br />I recommend this movie.  Granted it can be described as an acquired taste, yet I found the taste fast to acquire.  Four stars.
0441009425|4.0|Alastair Reynolds' first novel is a delight for those who love their SF hard and their science realistic. This isn't a space fantasy filled with hyperdrives and sword-wielding space captains. <br /> <br />What's nice here is that we get a number of initially separate plot lines that gradually intertwine and intersect, coupled with a sizeable playground (technologies, worlds, cultures, etc.) that are both well-described and interesting.  <br /> <br />The character development is pretty good too. Some people have noted that many of the characters are not likeable, which is true, but they're neither boring nor stereotypical.  <br /> <br />What's not so good is that the novel is overly long. The Big Mystery at the core (the mysterious actions of the mysterious aliens) just doesn't make a lot of sense. Reynolds is trying to have a big, galaxy-spanning motivation and it just doesn't hold up to scrutiny very well.  <br /> <br />The other notable problem is that Reynolds has a tendency to use deus-ex-machina, especially towards the end. This detracts from the finish. <br /> <br />Still, this is an impressive debut and I've forgiven lesser books greater sins. If you like hard SF, try Revelation Space.
B000O174CM|5.0|Don't even consider the negative, senseless comments from detractors.  Spoken words are not the sole component of acting. The art of musical theater requires acting through song and here, in her first showcase, Hudson comes off as a veteran of the art form.  In her eyes, intonation, and every part of her body, the \\"acting\\" comes through. The result? A deserved Academy Award for one of the finest ACTING performances of the year. Hands down. And I've never seen anyone stand up and applaud in the theater (as they did for Hudson) for any \\"real\\" actor like Meryl Streep. Those who criticize Hudson are part of a predictable backlash from film elitists.  Her debut is part of film history. Don't miss it!
B000A0GYD2|5.0|...because I was sleeping and did not understand as a little girl, barely nine, what it meant to take a step off our lonely planet and on to the nearest star. <br /> <br />Some 40 years later, I am learning every shred about the Apollo space program.  Back then, my small mind only knew about them through abbreviated nightly news programs or during those annoying \\"Special Report\\" broadcasts detailing the flight path of the latest mission. <br /> <br />Every classroom in America should cover this body of work with our young minds, thirsty for examples of real leadership and what rewards can be had with hard work and the courage to take risks. <br /> <br />\\"From Earth to the Moon\\" is worth every penny.  Run to buy it now.  And make sure you watch it with a big box of tissues at your side.  You'll be left with a tear in your eye and a lump in your throat throughout.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Ferrell has had a string of duds...'Taladega Nights', 'Anchorman', and 'Blades of Glory'.  The arrogant, oblivious moron character works for about 10 minutes, but becomes annoying and boring in a feature length film.  Ferrell's comedic presence is brilliant for a few minutes, and that's why he was so good on SNL.<br /><br />In 'Stranger Than Fiction', Ferrell breaks out of his normal role and turns out a wonderful performance.  He is convincing in his role of an average Joe Nobody and genuinely becomes a character you want to root for.  The storyline is creative and original.  Overall a very good film.
0380715430|3.0|Bill Bryson's THE MOTHER TONGUE is not the type of book you pick up and read from cover to cover.  Instead, it's a great \\"dipping\\" book.  You dip in and learn a little bit about the English language's history, quirks about many words, their spellings, their etymologies, and so forth.  For added flavor, there's the occasional Bill Bryson joke (he's a clever lad, and it's a good thing, given the book's scholarly bent).<br /><br />Prepare to like some chapters better than others.  \\"The First Thousand Years\\" was a bit of a drag for me (going way back, you see) and \\"Wordplay\\" was more fun; there's the anecdote, for instance, about a British crossword puzzle maker who came up with the clue \\"an important city in Czechoslovakia\\" which has an answer of \\"Oslo.\\"  If you're thinking Norway, look carefully at the sixth through ninth letters of that former Eastern European country's name.  Also entertaining are the plentiful details of battles between the English and the Americans (and no, I don't mean Bunker Hill -- I mean colour vs. color and Samuel Johnson vs. Noah Webster, etc.).<br /><br />It appears that the linguists have poked some holes in Bryson's scholarly research here as well (see spotlight review, for instance).  That lowers the rating, too, because, as a layman reader, you have no clue WHAT is accurate and what is not.  Not good.  Still, much of it is valid, certainly, as I verified many facts in other sources, and some of it is entertaining as well.  The bottom line?  Worth a look if you're a word fan like me.  If not, you probably won't even enjoy it as a \\"browser\\" (I'll have to ask Bill if that's a word or not).
B000LC55F2|2.0|All-star, REALLY HOT, awesome cast; excellent acting, great costuming and beautiful cinematography. A+ shirtless Jackman scene. <br /> <br />However, a convoluted mess of a movie with a labyrinthine storyline that is made mind-numbingly clear by the repeated insertion of painfully obvious foreshadowing. The story circled back upon itself several times, which made the excruciatingly too-long dramatic scenes seem even longer in a deja-vu sort of way. Could have been half an hour shorter, takes an ETERNITY to get to the point. I would have enjoyed it more had I fast forwarded through most of it. I'm glad I watched it, but a second viewing might be the cure for insomnia.

0307165485|5.0|This was my daughter's favorite book.  I'm so glad that I was able to remember the author's name.  My baby is now 30 and expecting her first child.  I can hardly wait to read these stories to my grandchild.  I can still remember my daughter's baby voice calling the detective Coucous.  It's pure joy to read to a child, and the memories last a lifetime.  I'm misting up just writing this.
1932100660|5.0|After reading this book, I want to convey some simple guidelines that worked for me.  Make sure your body mass index is within your age group, and your blood pressure is no more than 120/80 for men (or 110/70 for women).  Minimize eating processed food and stay with natural food.  Minimize eating animal-based food and eat diverse, plant-based food (I avoid eating beef, pork, dairy products, and eggs; I now mostly eat chicken and seafood).  Avoid eating fatty foods.  For me, I eat avocado in place of fatty food and mushrooms in place of meat.  The most important lesson for me is staying with natural, diverse plant-based food.
0374105235|4.0|First off this is a fantastic book, and as other reviewers before me have said it is quite a difficult read. Apart from that, I found the 'Boy Soldiers' account of the atrocity's committed in Sierra Leone spellbinding. Why successive Governments can go to war in the name of Peace and Democracy, and let the atrocity's of this beleaguered land languish on the back-burner has me stumped. <br />I most certainly recommend.
0743298020|5.0|Margaret Lea has been an excellent companion for the past days. Ms. Setterfield has created a modern masterpiece with extremely likable and intelligent characters not to mentions a fantastic storyline full of dark turns and revelations. I am not sure why the one reviewer spoke of \\"filth.\\" Such darkness is possible within the human psyche and it is, after all, a tale of Gothic horror. Insanity, incest, murder... as difficult as it is to reconcile these with our notion of rational man, they were quite the mainstay in Victorian literature. Better to look at these aspects in a well constructed vitrine. A good \\"penny dreadful\\" did little else than to put some color into pale feminine cheeks and Ms. Setterfield has given all of us who like to breathe a little faster from within the safe confines of our virtual corsets a pound for each well spent penny. Bravo! When can we hope for the next one?
0393316041|5.0|I have had the pleasure to be smitten by people of Feynman's character type &  generally have left their presence drooling with admiration and a certain sort of blessed reassurance that there is sanity in this crazy world.  <br /> <br />This book is not one I would characterize as an \\"easy read\\" especially if you don't have a basic & general background in all of the sciences. I consider myself to have a basic background and while grasping most of the stories & quips involving Feynman's fascination with biological concepts, I pretty much got glassy eyed when stumbling through quantum theory, theroms and what have you.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, this book is very entertaining and gives insight into the workings of a man of enormous curiosity , intelligence and whit.   <br /> <br />It is written in short chapters , each one could be read as a separate  story all of which are rich with adventure, sound scientific thinking and humor.  <br /> <br />I think every student from 5th grade through college level should be encouraged to read this book as it is a great lesson in how science is a process of sound thinking, logical reasoning, debate and discussion, success and failure. <br /> <br />Pick this one up. It is an exceptional insight into a brilliant mind, an interesting character and some background on his & other's contribution to our own American history. The book is written in Feynman's voice and will leave you feeling as if you knew him and begging for the chance to go back in time and have a cup of tea with him. <br /> <br />M
0060934700|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. If it were possible to give more than 5 stars, I would. I was introduced to this book when a friend of mine had me read one of the stories in this book. It was a dark, and I must admit, very disturbing retelling of the fairy tale Snow White. After reading it, I was somewhat perturbed, but I was also hooked. I looked high and low for a copy of the book, and when I finally came across one, I was not disappointed. Gaiman's stories are both haunting and compelling, and always entertaining. This is a book I'll read over and over... and over again.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a more faithful, darker rendering of Roald Dahl's 1964 book than the 1971 film. In that, although Gene Wilder was his usual delightful self, the direction, writing, and all other performances were mediocre and date badly. The changes from the book gave it a bland tone and a cheap look. Burton's film is a completely different vision, more like Dahl in its sophisticated whimsy and nightmarish quality, accomplished in Burton's inimitable style. Depp is a dismissive, sardonic Wonka; Wilder was just loopy. Any notion that Depp's subtle, eccentric performance has anything to do with Michael Jackson is way off-base: Depp's Wonka actually despises children, revealing that he was trying to find a child who was \\"the least repulsive,\\" a far-cry from an adult who wants to recapture his own childhood. The Burton film is not unlike Nicholas Roeg's faithful adaptation of Dahl's THE WITCHES--really close to Dahl's curmudgeonly view of children and the world; but CHARLIE goes farther with an ingenious, stunning visual style. The performances and look are genuinely funny, surreal, or moving. Depp acts rings around Wilder (these days, around anyone: it seems his range and flexibility are limitless). There is an added subplot dealing with Wonka's background, presumably written so that Christopher Lee could be included, about which some have complained. I think it works beautifully, and Lee is always a joy to watch. Recall that Dahl *disowned* the 1971 film and even refused to permit the use of his original title. He had been asked to write a screenplay, which was then radically altered into the bland mash that became WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. The Burton film has no such problems. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend it for all American children, given its morbidity and nihilistic tone. Unlike Americans, the English have never been afraid to show their kids the world without candy-coating it--another reason that the Burton film is far more authentic than its pallid 1971 screen predecessor. I think Dahl would have approved of this one. The DVD presents a crisp, colorful transfer in widescreen (avoid the zoomed/cropped full-screen version).
0061120073|5.0|There is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that has the rabbit running afoul of some dogs in the New York City.  Trapped in an alley, Bugs grabs a book that is nearby for some meager protection; the dogs see the title, perk up joyously and run away.  The name of the book:  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.  I have to wonder if more people have watched the cartoon than read the book that provided its punch line.  Up until recently, I was only in that former group, but not anymore. <br /> <br />A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is Betty Smith's semi-autobiographical novel of life in a poor family in the early 1900s.  As the story opens, it is 1912 and Francie Nolan - the protagonist - is eleven years old.  She lives in a small apartment with her father, mother and brother.  Her father Johnny is an amiable enough fellow who nonetheless has sunk into alcoholism.  Rarely employed - and becoming less employable - he is unable to be the family breadwinner.  Katie, his wife, married him more out of lust than love and now is suffering the consequences:  although still young and beautiful, she is suffering from the burden of holding the family together.  Neely, Francie's younger-by-a-year brother, still clings to childhood. <br /> <br />This is the story of Francie's life, and like any life story, it is not driven by plot as much as character.  We see Francie's development from child to young adulthood, while coping with the many problems (and occasional joys) that accompany an impoverished life.  Attending bad schools, going to church, working to support the family at meager wages, even contending with a psychopath:  these are some of the events that occur in Francie's life. <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, well worth the \\"classic\\" designation often given to it.  Smith's strengths are with her strong characters and wonderful writing.  Francie, of course, is the centerpiece; a girl who is gifted but may not be able to exploit those gifts in her poor environment.  Yes, there are sad moments in thisbook, but it is not really downbeat; one can imagine an adult Francie looking back at many of these events with a bit of wistfulness. <br /> <br />Compared to other \\"great\\" novels of yesteryear - such as Gone With the Wind, To Kill a Mockingbird or the Grapes of Wrath, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn seems to not get the same attention anymore.  It is, however, a book that is a pleasure to read. <br />
B0009HLD0K|5.0|I just watched this movie for the first time in many years, and was just as captivated by it now as I was when I first saw it shortly after its release in theaters.  Those who have grown up in small town America will find elements in the film that will take them back in time!  I watched the film with my 12 year old, and both of us connected with the story, the characters, and the humor in it.  This is indeed a real charmer of a film.  I gotta have the DVD for my collection!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig = James Bond <br />This new Bond has the true sex appeal that the Bonds post-Connery lacked. I hated the Roger Moore era. Things got better with Dalton and Brosnan was suave, but never seemed to be athletic enough to pass the physical demands of a super spy. The films just seemed to start relying on gadjets first, sheer smarts and work second. <br />Daniel Craig, from the first opening chase sequence to my personal favorite scene, the chair, was irreverant, super smart, ultimately sexy in the role. Too bad he fell for the Bond girl, automatic death sentence for her. Bond can't be in love or get married. <br />Super, super Bond movie. I saw it twice in the theaters and half dozen times on the DVD, and I never go twice to see any movie at the theater.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie makes 'Bad Lieutenant' look like a kids movie. Well, not entirely...But this is one of the few movies that had me just sitting in the dark when it was over, numb and overwelmed. The final 3-4 minutes of this film are so intense it would be hard to believe anyone could turn away; Yet this beautifully acted, sharply put together drug-love-tragedy doesn't end well for anyone, and will likely have a profound effect on those who make it to the end. Burstyn, like Keitel in 'Bad Lieutenant', throws herself into her part, devoid of any vanity or worry about how she looks on film. It is a brave, heartbreaking performance that remains one of the most unforgettable ones in recent film history. Everyone shines in this movie, and while the editing was an annoyance for some, I found it appropriate for the film...Strap yourself in and get ready to be be floored and depressed...But in a good way.
B000MV9026|5.0|I had this movie in my possession for over week and just got around to watching it.  The animation, the songs, the actors, etc. were EXCELLENT!  It's a thought-provoking film in that it shows how divided people's way of thinking is.  How can anyone not have a heart and not care what happens to our Earth and see how unbalanced she is?  Money has always ruled over the planet and the animals ... look at the mess it's in now!  Mumble and his Emperor Penguins show that they, too, are unique and special in their own right, and they have a place on this Earth as well!  My hat off to the producers of this movie!  It is sure to be a classic!
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Finding out about Beirut was one of the best things to happen to me (musically) in 2007. When I first heard their EP \\"[[ASIN:B000KQF70M Lon Gisland]]\\", I quickly proceeded to dig back in the past works by this fascinating act.<br /><br />Beirut blends a lo-fi sound not unlike a group of East European gipsies with a folk feel like Sufjan Stevens with leader Zach Condon's voice coming across much like David Byrne. The result is an exquisite and upbeat album that makes your heart pound with excitement making you want to jump, clap and laugh, with \\"Postcards From Italy\\" being one of the highlights.<br /><br />Thinking that this was Beirut's debut album just blows me away. If you like it, by all means pick up \\"[[ASIN:B000KQF70M Lon Gisland]]\\".
0930289234|5.0|Some of the reviews on here are a little ridiculous. YES, it is a tedious read. YES, the plot is difficult to understand and follow. YES, some of the themes are dated. However, that does not negate the fact that this is, by far, the BEST.Graphic.Novel.Ever. The characters feel real, the plot is absolutely mind blowingly good once you fully grasp it, and the action is perfectly paced. I absolutely cannot wait for the movie!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Well, I still prefer Sean Connery as Bond. Nevertheless, I recognized that after Connery, there is no better Bond; and speaking of production, this is the best of all 007 series... starting with opening credits and first scene. And what an amazing way of include famous line \\"Bond, James Bond...\\"!!
B000O178BY|5.0|I loved Beside You In Time, as some of the songs off With Teeth are alot better when played live...but I have to say this album is a true return to form for Trent Reznor....deftly combines everything he has touched upon in the past (Hard industrial guitars a la Broken, the darkness of the downward spiral, and the soundscapes of the Fragile) and created a true masterpiece. The CD art and thermal layering on the CD itself are worthy of a NIN release(unlike the simple design of With Teeth). The themes are engaging and interesting and startlingly relevant in the world we live in today. I am anxiously awaiting the North American tour!
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Probably those who were lucky enough to experience the first performances of Williams'masterpiece in the flesh (with Jessica Tandy as Blanche, for instance) are the only ones able to have a superior parameter to measure the play. For the rest of us, it is Elia Kazan's film.<br /><br />We, viewers, are blessed that such an ensemble (Kazan, Brando, Leigh, Malden and Hunter) rescued forever one of the peaks of US literature.<br /><br />For me, among its many virtues, the first and major is the magnificent confluence of the raising talent of Marlon Brando and the evening star of Vivien Leigh.
B000NJLPYI|5.0|Steve McQueen is an album I've been hoping to be re-mastered for years, along with Prefab's other great album, Jordan: The Comeback.  Jordan was an incredible album packed with great songs diverse both musically and lyrically.  SM was, however, more ethereal in its production with a sound that really has not been duplicated, ever.  Most people who listened to their first record, Swoon, are aware that Thomas Dolby, the producer, had an enormous influence on the outcome of SM.  Not only is the production different but the structure of the songs is better crafted.  Having at first listened to SM as a record, I always felt that the CD version lacked depth.  It must be added that the CD version I am used to is the American version of SM (called Two Wheels Good because the estate objected to the title).  That version included a fantastic extended version of Faron Young, a great county cover of He'll Have To Go and one more track.  When Love Breaks Down is also in an inferior state on Two Wheels Good, being slightly edited and mixed  <br /> <br />Now, more than 20 years after its initial release the album has been re-released, re-mastered by Thomas Dolby himself.  The extra tracks from Two Wheels Good are nowhere to be found.  That is understandable since Dolby had nothing to do with that production and they were also not really part of the original Steve McQueen release.  On a brighter note, the better version of When Love Breaks Down is intact.   <br /> <br />Although some recent re-mastered versions have improved the sound quality significantly, often it is simply because the transfer to the CD was initially incredibly sloppy.  Despite not being satisfied with the sound quality of Two Wheels Good, I cannot say that it was bad.  Many CD releases in their early stages simply were substandard and TWG was actually above the average for that period sound quality wise.  This makes the difference even more astonishing.  It is as if the music was transferred into 3-D.  Not onlyis there (much) added depth, the clarity and yet softness is way beyond what I am used to.  I even suspect that Dolby may have done some subtle re-mixing to obtain this effect because this is better than most productions done even in today's standards.  The only re-release that I can think of having been re-mastered closely as well is Fleetwood Mac's recent 2-CD edition of Rumours, but that version was initially transferred in an atrocious manner.  This re-mastered version would be worth the price alone. <br /> <br />There is, however, an extra CD included in this release.  Paddy McAloon decided to re-record acoustically 8 of the 11 songs from SM, as opposed to the usual demo/different versions/live versions/omitted tracks route.  This is admirable both in regards of bothering to set so much effort in a re-release project (recording of the acoustic set took supposedly much longer than the initial one) and also taking the chance re-recording classics that probably are a hard act to follow.  What surprised me is how complex the arrangements are.  Instead of Paddy strumming through the tracks with a guitar in his hands, most of the songs are complex interactions of guitars woven together.  Many of them are also re-arranged in a fashion that they are almost like different songs.  This works well on most of the songs but it most be kept in mind that in general people listening to these tracks are biased, being used to the older versions, including me. <br /> <br />The standout track is, surprising, Desire As.  The acoustic version is almost unrecognizable from the original one and, dare I say, better than the original one.  Another track which falls into that category is When the Angels, a lovely version that brings the text more to life.  The two tracks that I feel are lacking are Bonny and Goodbye Lucille #1.  Bonny is my favorite Prefab Sprout track, period, so maybe that makes it simply almost impossible for me being unbiased, but the singing is way below Paddy's usual standards and the arrangement lacks cohesion.  Goodbye Lucille #1 needed actually more re-arranging because the vocal interaction makes the song special but with only one voice it does not work out.  Faron Young has a Western feel in this arrangement and becomes very addictive after a few listens.  When Love Breaks Down, however, has a sweet feel, approaching the performance with a gentle approach once again but from a different angle.  Trying to maintain an objective stance, I rate this version as a 4 star record. <br /> <br />This set, however, is a 5 star project, both sonically and musically and very worth purchasing, both for those who own it already and others who still lack one of the most ethereal and stunningly produced releases in the last few decades. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000DN5W4I|5.0|This should be the FIRST concert DVD in anyone's collection as far as I'm concerned. The audio and video work it the best of any concert I've collected on DVD...and there are many.  I do want to clarify one thing for people who may not be too familiar with Joe B's playing.....yes, he does play the blues BUT...calling him a blues guitarist is a bit misleading. He's more of a rock guy than people give him credit for...with his influences being Cream-era Clapton, Jimmy Page, Billy Gibbons etc. All these guys also delved into the blues realm but they're truly rock guitarists...just as Joe is. This ISN'T a Stevie Ray Vaughn type of concert...all blues shuffles and 12-bar ballads. What you get here are great rock tones on several different guitars with the solid backing of Kenny Kramme (drums) and Eric Czar(bass). <br /> <br />My favorite DVD in my collection by far.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Chris Gardner is barely making ends meet by selling bone density scanners when the bottom drops out and his son's mother leaves him.  He decides that he will take a gamble and go without a salary for 6 months in order to be an intern at Dean Whitter and compete for one job with 19 other interns.  Things go from bad to worse, but through it all Gardner is a faithful father to his son and he does the best he can to raise him and train to be a stock broker at the same time.  Real-life father and son Will and Jaden Smith are well-cast as the inspirational Chris and Christopher Gardner.  There is an extra feature in which Chris Gardner is interviewed and he is shown going through an emotional time of reliving the difficulties of his life during the early 80's, when this movie takes place.  It is an inspiration to see what can be accomplished when a man stays true to his family values and refuses to give up his dream.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I believe it has been observed, more than once and in a variety of ways, that all of life is like a gigantic mirror. We see ourselves, everywhere. And, if we are beautiful (on the inside, where true beauty lives), then we will see beauty everywhere we look.    Life Is Beautiful puts this idea to the test. It posits a carefree, happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances a well-to-do lady in Mussolini's Italy (the film starts just on the onset of WWII). As he weds her, and they rear a child, they are soon put into jeopardy due to his Jewish heritage. Ultimately, they are sent to a Concentration Camp where his carefree, imaginitive and unceasingly joyful attitude are the only things that keep him, and his son, from utter despair.    Humor? Romance? Carefree? In a Nazi Death Camp?    To some, this is blasphemous. But to the makers of this film, and our lead character, life is beautiful, and this vision is taken from their perspective. That the film manages to show that there is joy, love and beauty--even in the worst imaginable conditions--is a testament to the way in which the film succeeds, and also to the basic truth of the message. Yes, things may be awful (and more often then not, they are)... but yes, also: life is beautiful.    This film gets my highest recommendation. Five stars.
1932100660|5.0|The information in this book is without peer.  I would never have believed the results of these myriad studies if I hadn't seen the pictures, statistics, and conclusive evidence.  I can't even imagine what book the reviewer Asian 123 read, who said it recommended an Asian diet and that the health statistics weren't very good. ???  That really wasn't what the book said at all,and this is the largest study on nutrition and health ever done with much of the data presented for the reader! <br /> <br />Incredible information with incredible potential -- however, the results of the studies will be unpopular to Americans, and many will not even try.  As for me and my family, we are going to choose a long and healthy life using as much of this information as we can - though it will probably take a bit of time to migrate.  Thank you T.

0743454537|3.0|The premise is intriguing - parents of a dying child conceive a genetically matched sibling to be a cord blood donor.  The procedure puts the first child into remission, but when her leukemia rears its ugly head again, the parents \\"return to the well\\" and continue, time after time, to harvest cells and marrow and whatnot from their donor child.  The book begins when Anna, the donor, is thirteen and being asked to donate a kidney to older sister Kate, who is in the final stages of renal failure - her body is worn out after years of fighting her illness.  She retains a lawyer and sues her parents for medical emancipation. <br /> <br />The story unfolds from the points of view of Anna, her lawyer, her court-appointed advocate, and various members of her family.  It definitely raises some interesting moral questions which would spur some fascinating discussion (it's my book club's current selection).  But I did grow tired of Picoult's writing style.  As another reviewer mentioned, the dialogue simply does not ring true - every chapter break, every break within chapters, ends on some sort of melodramatic zinger of a line.  Every once in a while it would have been fine, but not all the time.  And not from a 13-year old character, either. People just don't talk like this. Eventually I found myself skimming those chapter breaks because I just couldn't stop rolling my eyes at how silly some of these characters sounded. <br /> <br />But, still three stars for the thought-provoking plot.  Definitely makes you wonder what you might do in the same situation.
B000000XBE|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival's \\"Chronicle\\" is one of the first CDs any music fan should buy.  It's a flawless collection of some of the greatest American music ever recorded.
B000000OQF|5.0|this is music for music listeners.  the album was written by those who could care less about making money off of their music.  listening to this glorious compilation, it's obvious that these people weren't interested in entering the mainstream.  actually, it seems quite clear that they were trying to avoid such things.  the result - pissed off, bluesy, gutteral brilliance.  unfortunately, they were never able to recapture the essence of this work, as they (like many others) became millionaires, and multi-platinum celebrities and seemed to have lost sight of what made them pioneering musical masterminds.  if all you know is welcome to the jungle and sweet child o' mine, BUY THIS ALBUM immmediately, and understand why people write and listen to music with this 'mud-covered gem' of american musical history!

0316743003|5.0|Pondering his retirement, Kelly Johnson, legendary head of Lockheed's Skunk Works selected Ben Rich to take over. Rich lacked Kelly's high profile and bombastic leadership, but not his vision and leadership. For 16 of his 40 years at Lockheed Rich lead the famed group. For the prior 24 years he learned the art and craft of building far beyond the state of the art vehicles in impossibly short time.   <br /> <br />Kelly's retirement was at the height of the public acclaim for the magnificent SR-71, the U-2 and countless others achievements. Rich had the vision and courage to lock onto stealth technology in its infancy, recognizing that the survival rate for manned bombers over the then primary threat, the USSR, was going to be low. The Russians had made an incredible investment in their strategic defenses.  <br /> <br />The US depended on the manned bomber as the third leg of the strategic triad - submarine launched missiles, land based missiles and strategic bombers. Rich believed the alternative was stealth. Much of the later portion of the book talks of the development of stealth technology, selling it to the Air Force and then building the airplane under the heavy hand of the Air Force.  <br /> <br />The early part of the book is a great \\"other look\\" at the Skunk Works under Johnson.  Ben Rich was there, playing a major role in the design of many of the aircraft. He captures the challenges, the victories and the defeats.  <br /> <br />He also brings to life the almost comical cover for the U-2 program as parts and supplies were delivered to a fictional company far from Lockheed and paid for with funds that flowed directly from the CIA to Kelly Johnson. Far from reckless, the U-2 investment was probably the wisest federal purchase since Alaska. Its success was a direct reflection of the lack of direct involvement by the government in the design and the lack of government supervision of the development and construction.  <br /> <br />Wrapped up in this book and Johnson's bio are priceless bits of wisdom regarding leadership in the technical and business world. The book is a good read for someone with no interest in airplanes but an interest in corporate or government leadership. <br /> <br />Rich also talks of the sad decline of Kelly Johnson in the later years after his struggles with the health problems and untimely deaths of his wives.  <br /> <br />One of the interesting stories is Rich's discussion of the design of the drone designed to be carried by the SR-71. The idea was to fly to the edge of the unfriendly territory , launch the disposable drone and recover the film it was to drop over waiting ships. The drones looked like miniature SR-71s in their stealth like shape and black paint. Unfortunately one of the SR-71s and the pilot were lost in an early attempt to launch the drone off the California coast and the program shifted the mothership role to the B-52.   <br /> <br />Co-author Loe Janos understands aviation and his talents are obvious. Somehow they managed to get the book together in the sadly short interval between Rich's 1991  retirement from Lockheed and his death in 1995.  The book is an outstanding tribute to a little known (outside of the industry and military) leader who ably filled impossibly large boots. A great read.
B000063DFN|5.0|By 1984, Iron Maiden already had already released 2 back-to-back classic albums and they showed no signs of slowing down. Nobody expected them to make a record better than 1982's The Number of the Beast.  <br /> <br />But they did. <br /> <br />For 1984 was the year that Iron Maiden forced the metal world to drop down to its knees and gaze in wonder as their 5th album, Powerslave, was dropped to the public. <br /> <br />There are absolutely no weak tracks on Powerslave. Classics \\"Aces High\\" and \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" start off the masterpiece, and is followed by the excellent instrumental \\"Losfer Words (Big `Orra)\\". \\"Flash of the Blade\\" features amazing vocals by Bruce Dickinson (as usual), and \\"The Duelists\\" has some great rhythm work. I love the \\"fight to the death\\" line at the end. Next is \\"Back in the Village\\", a continuance to \\"The Prisoner\\" from The Number of the Beast. With song 7 the album completely hits a new high and never returns. \\"Powerslave\\", written by Bruce Dickinson, is a masterpiece about a pharaoh struggling to come to grips that he cannot reign forever and must die. The album closes with Iron Maiden's biggest and most ambitious closer, \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". The song is based on the poem of the same name by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.  <br /> <br />Iron Maiden are at their peak here. The guitars have the best sound that Dave Murray and Adrian Smith have ever accomplished. Bruce Dickinson pushes his amazing vocals to the limit on every song (except the instrumental, mind you). Bass god and Iron Maiden leader Steve Harris plays every note with pinpoint precision. Nicko McBrain does a phenomenal job (as always) on the drums. <br /> <br />After Powerslave, Iron Maiden were arguably the most powerful metal band on the face of the earth. The massive World Slavery tour followed and by the end of it the world was bowing to Maiden. <br /> <br />So go buy this record, its Iron Maiden at their best. <br /> <br />They would, however, create another record that is just as good as Powerslave, but that wouldn't happen for a little while.
B000000OAL|5.0|This eponyous album is the most emotionally pure and personal ever produced by Queen.  Because it is closely related in style and substance to its successor, \\"Queen II,\\" the two are best considered together, somewhat in the fashion of a novel and its sequel.    Commenting on \\"Queen II\\" another reviewer states: \\"This is Queen at the height of their eccentricities. . . most of it is not classifiable in terms of genres of pop music.\\"  Though the phrasing is somewhat patronizing, the comment is true in its essence, and true of \\"Queen\\" as well.  The reviewer also remarks on the album's \\"obscure fantasy novel\\" feel and stylistic cohesion, including tracks that blend into each other.  The debut \\"Queen\\" is more conventional in having discrete tracks, but it too can be enjoyed as a single story that is suggestive rather than bluntly literal, allowing the listener considerable interpretive freedom.    \\"Queen\\" and \\"Queen II\\" possess qualities that set them apart from anything else, even within the band's own body of work.  Together, they are the greatest albums Queen ever created.  Both defy categorization and thus lack the megamarket appeal usually required for lasting pop fame.      Queen never quite fit into any standardized slot, even after their self directed pop transformation - a swan (phoenix?) among ducklings, they were always gloriously unique.  It is a tribute to their unshakeable determination and superb execution that these four visionaries achieved popular recognition against very great odds.      I wish they hadn't felt it necessary to head in an increasingly dumbed down direction, conceptually speaking, but it paid off and kept the band unified and undistracted by day jobs.  Their catchy pop offerings (\\"We Will Rock You,\\" \\"We Are the Champions\\" etc.) also afforded a toehold into mass culture sufficient to keep their early and more adventurous later work available to this day, so I don't question their judgement.  Certainly their popularization was always handled with assurance and intelligence.    If you adore Queen's pop anthems and similar hits of the period, it's possible \\"Queen\\" and \\"Queen II\\" will not be to your taste.  On the other hand, if you think you hate Queen but have never heard anything but the pop stuff, you owe it to yourself to give these albums a listen.    --------------  NOTE:  As with so many other album rereleases, there are bonus tracks on this CD.  These are nice to have, but almost always jar the listener since they were not part of the original album's design and rarely fit well where they are placed.  I'm looking forward to an accessible technology that will allow quick, easy auditory & historical analysis of such tracks so the user can assign them to their most appropriate & pleasing position within a body of work.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Anthology is the history of the Beatles as told by the Beatles.  It is the story of the Beatles from when they were young boys in Liverpool to when they recorded their last album, and everything in between.  It is not only told through their words and interviews, but by their music, their movies and live performances, including their first concert at Shea Stadium and their appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show, just to name a few.  Anthology also comes with a bonus disc of extras which includes the making of Anthology and the recording of the two latest Beatles singles, \\"Free as a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\".  Anthology is 10 hours of pure joy for anyone who likes the Beatles.  Just sit back, watch, listen and enjoy!

0446310786|5.0|I've reread this book twenty some years since I read it first and it was just as good, nay, better, this second time around.  Placing the story in a more mature context, (yes, my own - we provide context for the things we read) has given the story a historical depth and richness that it didn't have the first time.  If you haven't read this book in awhile, reread it.  Everything changes, even classics.

B000N6TX1I|4.0|<br />This movie takes place in a future England in which it is still trying to maintain a hold on civilization when much of the rest of the world has been seemingly turned chaotic or destroyed.  This is only the backdrop, though.  The main story centers around the theme that for approximately 18 years, not one woman in the world has been able to conceive due to some unknown mass infertility amongst humans.  One woman, however has become pregnant, and is taken into secretive care to be transported to a safe haven no one really is sure exists.  One man, (Clive Owen) has become a reluctant guide (even though he doesn't know what he is doing either) and the rest of the movie takes place around the extreme events to get this woman to the safe haven. <br /> <br />The events compare and contrast the evils people will do amongst a world like this and the good that still would remain.  The settings are bleak, but the goodness among the main characters contrasts this.  What I really like about this movie is it may appear to be the end of the world, but the movie gives a bit of hope in a mysterious way as to leave you satisfied, but vague enough to create your own conclusions. <br /> <br />A great movie in which you may take away some lessons, but it's mainly just an entertaining watch.
B00008EYA5|3.0|SWAT is a good, not a great action movie.  The opening scene is a take on a real life bank robbery, in which the robbers wore body armour and fired fully automatic assualt rifles.  This is probably the most intense scene in the film.  The rest of the film is pretty much Hollywood fare, with a predictable storyline and character profiles, examples: good cop(s) turn bad, evil drug lord, tough female cop etc. etc. etc. Samuel L. Jackson gives a credible performance as the leader of the SWAT team.  Colin Farrell as the hotshot member leaves no memorable screentime.  The film attempted to forge a middle ground between reality and super heroism, but remained as neither.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Despite many trifles and scandals that Whitney has experienced throughout most of the 2000s, it cannot be forgotten that at one point she was one of the most admired and successful singers ever, with perhaps one of the greatest singing voices ever recorded.  This is a perfect album to become acquainted with her magical gift. <br /> <br />\\"You Give Good Love\\" is a very beautiful song.  Her lush vocals and light backround singing make a very romantic song.  A <br /> <br />\\"Thinking About You\\" is perhaps the most dated song on this album, and my least favorite.  It's also not too catchy, but it's nice and upbeat. C+ <br /> <br />\\"Someone for Me\\" is also a bit dated for a twenty-year-old recording.  But it's pretty nice and Whitney's vocals save the song.  B- <br /> <br />\\"Saving All My Love For You\\" was one of her first big hits, and it's easy to see why.  A song that shows that Whitney knows when to embellish the notes and when to be more low key.  Incredibly romantic.  A <br /> <br />\\"Nobody Loves Me Like You Do\\" is a great duet with Jermaine Jackson.  The two have good chemistry, and the chorus can give you goosebumps.  It's a little hokey, but still really good.  B+ <br /> <br />\\"How Will I Know\\" is a fun song to listen to.  Definitely not meant to take seriously.  Certainly a bit cheesy, but it's incredibly catchy and uplifting.  A- <br /> <br />\\"All at Once\\" is a pretty ballad.  Very sweet and good vocals, though the lyrics are a bit trite and ordinary.  A- <br /> <br />\\"Take Good Care of My Heart\\" is another duet with Jermaine Jackson.  More uptempo than the first, and inferior in comparison.  Not too catchy and poor background music make an already mediocre song worse.  C <br /> <br />\\"Greatest Love of All\\" was her signature song for a while, and it's definitely catchy and beautiful.  Some of the lyrics can be sappy and preachy, but otherwise the song is very uplifting and sends a good message.  A- <br /> <br />\\"Hold Me\\" is a flawless track that is very sexy and beautiful.  As a duet with Teddy Pendergrass, the two have fantastic chemistry, and the chorus will send shivers up your spine.  A <br /> <br />If you are wondering what made Whitney Houston one of the most beloved singers of the 80s and 90s, this is a good place to be introduced.  These songs show a young woman with a great maturity.  With a new album hopefully coming out in the near future, Whitney may be able to show that this was not the only timeless album she had out of her.   <br /> <br />
B00005JPLW|5.0|This is one of the few perfect movies in existance. Zack Snyer completely redeemed himself and then some after his Dawn Of The Dead remake. This movie is simply amazing in every aspect. The directing is beautiful along with the visulas. The acting is great, the FX are great. And knowing what this battle did for us in reality just makes me love the movie even more. This movie is perfect. It is completely flawless. And it's a great guy movie. Action, violence, over the top gore that fits perfectly in the movie, a little sex and nudity and women get to see guys with rock hard abs. Go see this movie on the big scree, I don't know if it can possibly be as good as what it is on a small screen.
0446310786|5.0|When I first decided I was going to read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" for an English assignment, I got mixed reviews from my peers. My best friend told me she disliked it, but my English teacher and another friend in my class told me it was a great book and I would enjoy it. I didn't know what exactly to expect until I started reading it. <br /> <br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a wonderful story that greatly portrays childhood innocence and insight in a conflicted society that existed down South in the 1930's. Scout Finch, the young girl who narrates the story, is a truly convincing and lovable character. She takes you on a journey through Maycomb, Alabama, her home town, where her views of morality and good and evil are tested by what happens over the course of a year. The views and attitudes of the townsfolk and the other colorful characters that are encountered throughout the course of the novel are unique and completely believable. Maycomb could have been a real town that existed in America. <br /> <br />I would recommend \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" to anyone who hasn't read it, even my own peers. It is that moving of a book, and I will read it again when I get the chance to. <br /> <br />- Brittany Treichel, 17
B00005QDW5|5.0|If you're gonna side-step the actual albums and simply dip into a compilation of this seminal band, then this is a safe bet for a solid primer. This collection is substantive, richly entertaining and demonstrates the enduring appeal of one extraordinary band.
B000NA77YO|5.0|OK, so we all know that this version of the band has had it's ego differences and all... But at least we now have the chance (I said chance) of getting something new and positive out of this lineup. I don't know about you, but I have grown tired of this Ozzy era reunion crap that has put out NOTHING but the same old tired concert year after year at practicly every Ozzfest since 1999. The new tracks on this CD are very refreshing and it is great to hear some of the older material remastered. Hopefully they will give ALL the Dio era albums the same treatment as they did with the Black Box...
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Watching Yanni Live! is like Charlie winning the Golden Ticket. You are up close and personal to Yanni and his band. It's beautiful to watch because you can see that every single band member and Yanni are having the time of their lives. They're having fun with each other, entertaining the crowd, and it makes you feel like you're right there sitting in the front row. This DVD is beautifully done and it's a concert you'll want to see again and again, not just once and store it on a shelf.<br /><br />My mom used to hate Yanni. She sat down with my and watched this DVD concert and fell in love. Yanni truely is a master. This is so much fun to watch and the music is terrific.
B000009EOR|3.0|OK, so this album was once upon a time the collector's dream. But there are too many versions of this album. There is the original European vesion... Then there is the German version with alternate ZZ's, then there is the Japanese version which includes \\"Shandi\\" and \\"Escape From The Island\\" (which was unavailable in Japan at the time) and the Aussie vesion with \\"Talk To Me\\"... WHEW!! Anyway... the only reason this CD is worth getting is this:    1. This album is the only album you can find the song \\"Down On Your Knees\\".    2. This is the only album you can find the ORIGINAL mix of \\"Partners In Crime\\". All the singles featuring this song contained a remix version even though it does not state that it is a remix.    3. This is the only album you can find the single mix of \\"Shout It Out Loud\\".    4. This is the only album you can find the single mix of \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\".    So if you are a die hard then this is the CD for you. But be aware that you can find excellent remasterd versions of \\"I'm A Legend Tonight\\" and \\"Nowhere To Run\\" on the KISS GOLD compilation as well.    Also of note the KISS BOX SET features a remix version of \\"Nowhere To Run\\"!!    You may love KISS or you may hate KISS... But one thing's for sure and that is you have owned KISS in one shape or form...
0571202284|2.0|I bought this book as it was a required text for my Animation 101 course. While it's interesting because it was written (and drawn) by the creator of Roger Rabbit, it's quit boring if you are not enthusiastic about animation. It focuses on drawing techniques to help cel animation, but does not touch on any computer animation which is why I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />If you are a serious artist interested in cartoons, live drawings, and animations, this book is a great reference tool. (Especially for creating walking sequences.) For those of you like me who prefer creating things on the computer, you'll be disappointed.
B00006FDCD|1.0|Comparing to the great adaptations of other Steven King novels, such as Dolores Claiburne or Shining, this film is utterly bad. Most actors simply can not act, and the film suffers from a cheap, TV-like approach. If you expect more than cheap thrilling, then save your time and read the book. This movie is an offense.
B00005JPP6|5.0|Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a top cop in London's precinct, but because he's responsible for solving all the crimes, his colleagues have been made to all look bad. Forced to move to the Sanford precinct, Nick must also work with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the overeager constable and son of revered police chief Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is a hardcore action nut, and enjoys films such as \\"Bad Boys II\\" and \\"Point Break\\", so he believes Nick to be the real deal. Meanwhile, a series of bizarre accidents that lead to people's demises occur, but no one except believes Nick when he believes these accidents to be the work of some darker force, except for Danny, who could believe that this could be the chance to live out fantasy. So the two must work together and find out who the person behind the Grim Reaper cloak is. <br /> <br />Who could forget \\"Shaun of the Dead\\"? This wacky zombie film pretty much was an homage to horror comedies (\\"Dead Alive\\" - I bring it up because director Peter Jackson among others praised the film) and George A. Romero-directed zombie films. It put director Edgar Wright at the top of the heap, and Simon Pegg became a hot commodity (he had a brief, but major role in \\"Mission Impossible III\\", and appeared in the Grindhouse faux trailer Don't, directed by Wright). Well, Wright, Pegg, Pegg's co-star Nick Frost, and a host of famous British actors rally up for \\"Hot Fuzz\\". And I'm pleased to report that it's a blast. <br /> <br />With \\"Fuzz\\", Wright sinks his claws into the action film genre, but uses films of Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver lore as pie crust. That's right, \\"Bad Boys II\\" and \\"Lethal Weapon\\" are among the many films of \\"honorable\\" mention. From uttering infamous quotes (\\"**** just got real\\") to filming a fist fight during a rainstorm (that happened during the final battle between Mel Gibson and Gary Busey's individual characters in the Richard Donner classic), Wright lampoons these scenes and makes sure they gel withthe story effectively enough. Of course, there's other films that aren't safe: John Woo (gunslingers holding two guns), Clint Eastwood (Nick rides into town on a horse), and Tony Scott (flashbacks and suspects getting labeled have the sheen of a Nine Inch Nail video, just like in \\"Domino\\"). <br /> <br />The film also moves at a frenetic speed, yet there's plenty of time for characterization (wait until you hear what Nick Angel wanted to be before he chose the way of the shield). Of course, Wright doesn't pack on too much emotional weight on, since this is a spoof after all, but we enjoy the entertaining chemistry between Simon Pegg's straight-man sergeant and Nick Frost's oafish constable sidekick. And, like in \\"Bad Boys II\\", they have to put up with two jerk officers (\\"In America\\"'s Paddy Considine, Shaun of the Dead's Rafe Spall) who often make fun of them. Of course, unlike Jose Pablo Cantillo's meany cop from \\"Disturbia\\", the Andys are always a welcome presence, and play off well against our heroes. <br /> <br />Even the supporting characters get plenty of well-written parts. \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" vet Bill Nighy makes the most of his limited screen time as Nick's original boss, Jim Broadbent matches Nick Frost's character's oafish constable as the Sanford chief, Paul Freeman (who played Ivan Ooze in the first \\"Power Rangers\\" film) is deadpan best as a priest who is part of a lampoon of Robert Rodriguez's \\"Desperado\\" (he brandishes his guns from his shirt sleeves), \\"The Wicker Man\\"'s Edward Woodward has fun as the member of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance (I'll let you ponder on the abbreviation), and Timothy Dalton... I will be happy to say that one of the best actors to play James Bond (right up there with Daniel Craig) gives a bravura comedic performance as the smarmy supermarket owner (think of Cantillo's \\"Disturbia\\" performance, only intentionally funny and never overstaying its welcome). <br /> <br />Wright doesn't stop there. With 30 minutes left to go, thedirector films one of the longest, and most suspenseful, action scenes of the year. With Nick armed with almost every weapon from the storage, aforementioned side players pushed into the fray, plot twists about some of the Sanford citizens (which will rock your socks off), and David Arnold's adrenaline-charged compositions backing it up, \\"Fuzz\\" delivers high-speed action and laughs when our heroes fight the bad guys. I doubt anyone will sleep through it. <br /> <br />\\"Hot Fuzz\\" is irrepressible fun, and in a time when the only action comedies available are crap (\\"Code Name: The Cleaner\\"), it hardly pulls any punches. Even during the ending, which could've been melancholy, gets sucker punched with a scorching-hot one-liner (\\"Bring the Noise\\") and an enjoyable punk rock tune to cap it all off. For me, this is heaven. And I will await the days for Edgar Wright's next beast. Maybe we'll get some Americans in the cast?
B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead is the great tease of 90s music.  Beth Gibbons continues to record, but Portishead created such complex and lush soundscapes that their limited catalog is simultaneously disappointing and sacrosanct. <br /> <br />The beats and mix of instrumentation, the biting torch song lyrics and the haunting electronic synth bed are still sonically on the cutting edge of what artists are creating 10-12 years later. <br /> <br />This album is full of languid trip hop beats that contrast well with Beth's tortured vocals. <br /> <br />A must own for serious rock fans
B00005Y7NK|5.0|Sinceramente y sin rodeos creo que este es un álbum que ha sido ninguneado por muchos pero para mi está en el Top 5 de Black Sabbath: 1)Master of Reality; 2)Heaven And Hell; 3)Vol.4; 4)Headless Cross; 5)Paranoid.  Tal vez parezca aventurado pero para mi el colocarlo 4 en el Top 5 de Black Sabbath es comparable al ¿por qué Hugo Sánchez no está considerado dentro de los 5 mejores jugadores de fútbol soccer de todos los tiempos junto con Maradona y Pelé? porque sencillamente es mexicano y no argentino, brasileño o alemán; así mismo ¿porque Headless Cross de Tony Martin, Lawrence Cottle y Cozy Powel no está considerado dentro de los 5 mejores LPs de Black Sabbath junto con Master of Reality y Heaven And Hell? tan sencillo como que el vocalista no es Ozzy ni Dio ni en el bajo está Geezer.   Como se ha comentado, musicalmente es de lo mejor que el Sabbath lanzó y para mi los riffs de Paranoid, Children of the Grave, Heaven and Hell, Neon Knights y Devil And Daughter son los mejores no solo en el repertorio de Black Sabbath sino en la historia del rock (y perdón a los fans de Metallica, Guns And Roses y otros).  Desde el comienzo con The Gates of Hell se puede respirar la calidad de todo el disco y por supuesto que no defrauda, al seguir con Headless Cross se reafirma y con la obra maestra de Devil And Daughter es inevitable caer a los pies de este disco, lo anterior sin mencionar la excelsa colaboración de Brian May en When Death Calls y las excelentes pausas y efectos en Kill in The Spirit World y Nightwing.  Líricamente es también muy bueno y no le pide nada a los de las eras de Ozzy y Dio, solo que nuevamente es minimizado porque aquí las letras son en su mayoría de Tony Martin y no de Dio/Iommi/Butler o de Ousborne/Iommi/Butler/Ward.  En conclusión: Headless Cross es el mejor álbum de Black Sabbath en la era de Tony Martin y en cuarto mejor de todas las eras, llámese Ozzy, Dio o Gillan.  Que viva Black Sabbath y que viva el Rock!!!!!!!!!!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone should see this fantastic DVD. Maybe there is no such thing as global warming, maybe there is no such thing as a link between smoking and  cancer, maybe you can put on a blindfold and walk across a busy interstate without being struck by a vehicle. Even if you are willing to take these chances, are you willing to subject your children to them. The debate should be over. The time for action is now.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|I always thought the studio version of \\"Light My Fire\\" (my favorite song of all time) would sound a little bit better IF ONLY the speed was a little faster, like many of the great live versions (Live at the Hollywood Bowl CD, Alive She Cried CD, Live at the London Roundhouse, etc.).  I was totally unaware that the song actually WAS mixed slower on the original album.  This explains why I thought the song sounded even better when it was played back slightly faster, such as on a variable speed record player.    Fast forward to March, 2007.  I receive an e-mail from Amazon.com, telling me I can purchase The Doors separately from \\"Perception\\" (the box set).  I also found out that the CD was re-mixed at its proper speed, thanks to a university professor of music, who notified Bruck Botnick (long-time Doors' engineer and sound mixer) regarding the speed of the original recording.      Since I have almost all The Doors studio and live albums, my main interest was in listening to their debut album at the proper speed, as well as the new remastering (using new computer technology).    I am very, very impressed with the album's sound quality.  It sounds incredibly crisp and clear for a 1966 recording.  \\"Light My Fire\\" definitely sounds better at the proper speed, and Jim's vocal is very crisp and hypnotic. It sounds particularly clear and passionate on this version of Light My Fire, and throughout the album.  The CD sounds best when driving in your car at night, and having the sound turned up. I haven't even played it on my home sound system yet, but I am looking forward to it.     The rest of the CD sounds great, too.  I highly recommend this CD to all Doors fans, both old and new.  This new CD has only strengthened my appreciation of a band that I love so much.
0385338694|4.0|This is the first of her books I've read, so if the others are better, I can't wait.  Yes, the he plot is ridiculous and it has a prince charming ending, , and yes, you know how it will come out.  But that doesn't ruin the many laugh out loud moments and the sheer delight of getting to the end.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|After nearly 10 years, Loreena McKennitt returns to the studio. This is a lovely CD, but there is very little new music here . Yes, all of the songs are new, but she re-visits the same melodies that have served her well in the past . I have 4 of her earlier CD's, from Parallel Dreams to The Book Of Secrets and every time I listen to this CD, I keep hearing her previous songs in my head . All of the songs are well done and she has not lost her ability to present cohesive stories . It just would have been nice to hear some new melodies.
055358202X|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I was riveted by the first three books in this series.  I still can't wait for the next in this series.  However, by contrast, this book was disappointing.  I still felt it was worth reading, but it did not even closely equal the excellence of the first three books.  <br />
B00003CXIP|5.0|This is a movie based on a novel written by Stephen King. The powerful theme is the development of friendship during our formative years, those friendships that help form and shape our character. <br /> <br />The story is about a group of twelve to thirteen year old boys. The main character is played by Wil Wheaton who is Gordie, a young man who recently became invisible to his parents over the death of an older brother, the favorite, a strong athlete, foot-ball player. We see him at home, trying to talk to his mother, who does not hear or see him for she is totally overcome with grief. His father also ignores him, making him feel that he is nothing as compared to the brother that recently died. <br /> <br />River Phoenix, who plays Chris, is the young man that comes from a bad family, and as such, is expected to grow up to be nothing. In fact, he does not believe he can study, for who would want and support his efforts? At school, there is some money missing and everyone believes he took it, because, who else would do such a thing? <br /> <br />Corey Feldman plays Teddy, the son of a violent alcoholic, who was near killed by his father in a fit of rage that made him put his son's head over the fire that almost burnt his ear off. <br /> <br />The last character is played by Jerry O'Connell in the role of Vern, a kid who is scared of almost anything, but the one responsible for the adventure they are about to undertake, for he hears his older brothers tell the story of a body they found of a young man who has not been seen for days. <br /> <br />They set out to find and observe the dead body of this other kid, killed by a passing train. The reason for their desire to be the first to find this body is to gain recognition, fame, and an opportunity to be in the news, both on radio and TV. So, they are willing to walk 25 to 30 miles, through swamps and open fields in morbid fascination with a corpse that lays out there. <br /> <br />As they live through this adventure, they encounter danger, hunger, a ferocious dog with a fowled mouth, mean and vicious owner, a swamp where they encounter and get their bodies covered with leeches, and a near call as they try to cross a bridge... intended for trains... not people. <br /> <br />But as we live the adventure with the main characters, we find that this movie is about the friendship of these boys, as they help one another grow and confront their personal daemons.  <br /> <br />As the story opens we find Richard Dreyfuss narrating the story as the adult version of the character played by Wheaton, who was the story teller of the group and grew to become a writer. During the movie, we have the rare opportunity to see very young versions of great actors of today, namely... Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack. <br />  <br />
0553588486|5.0|I loved this book.  Rich characters, complex plot, full of twists and surprises, and well written.  Although not as dense as Tolkien, this is a considerable and interesting back story history to most of the characters.<br /><br />I find I can often predict where things are going in a book.  In most stories, there are characters that you know are expendable and those that you are sure will survive. NOTHING of the sort here.  Every character is really at risk and their futures are uncertain.<br /><br />The only problem is that the author is still writing the series.  I look forward to the future installments.  There was nothing of the sort here.  Even the major characters
B000062Y98|5.0|Reams of time and energy were expended on putting _A Night at the Opera_ toghether, more so than is common for anything in the class of power metal. For the most part, it certainly shows. Blind Guardian's writing is so sophisticated that few bands match their acumen, and the attention afforded this release is certainly to their benefit.<br /><br />At least for the most part. The production is perhaps the only nagging flaw in this otherwise pristine work of typical Blind Guardian awesomeness. I miss Flemming Rasmussen's unmatched production for _Imaginations from the Other Side_ and _Nightfall in Middle-Earth_. People like the rag the poor guy because he `butchered' Metallica's _...And Justice for All_ (allegedly), but Blind Guardian was never better served. Although there are vastly more vocals on display here, peaking with the 100+ vocal tracks on \\"And Then There Was Silence\\", Rasmussen's production still managed to give the massive choral onslaughts more `oomph.' When the choruses kick in on songs like \\"Into the Storm\\", \\"Script from My Requiem\\", or \\"Imaginations from the Other Side\\", it's like a punch in the gut -- there might as well be a hundred men singing those lines. Here on _A Night at the Opera_, the overall sound seems softer and choruses lack the same explosive effect.<br /><br />This should not be too emphasized, for there might be an element of relativity given the sheer amount of vocals on this album. Hansi's voice is rarely heard alone, usually backed by multitracked vocal armies, which hits the peak of intensity on \\"And Then There Was Silence\\", Blind Guardian's best song brimming with fifteen minutes of choral exclamations and orchestral guitar arrangements. The other songs are of the usual BG standard, with the ethic of not repeating anything unless it is rearranged or given different inflection repeated on a grander scale. In bringing their music an even greater degree of enormity, Blind Guardian cranks the amount of solemn drama which gives their music such addictive qualities. And since _Imaginations..._, Blind Guardian has been progressively mastering their inventive construction of song structures using various tempos, arrangements, and melodic twists. Also, where the biggest shining point of Blind Guardian songs is almost invariably the choruses, almost more exciting here is not the chorus themselves, but how the choruses are arrived at through sweeping vocals, weaving metal scales and distorted crunch.<br /><br />This is a masterful album, and judging by the subsequent release _A Twist in the Myth_, executed at a scale we might not see again.

B000I9B6VK|5.0|Good story, songs, acting, I don't understand why this is not released as a Region 1 DVD.  However, multi-region DVD players are now available for low cost. I bought one especially so my wife, a Streisand enthusiast, could see this movie.  We were not disappointed.
B000O178BY|4.0|Let's face facts, while \\"With Teeth\\" was a decent album, it was not a quality NIN album. After \\"The Fragile\\" I think we were all expecting another masterpeice of epic proportions. Is this CD the heir to that album? I'm not sure... but it's damn close.  <br />Worst songs: Capital G, Survivalism, The Great Destroyer. <br />Best songs: In This Twilight, My Violent Heart, Me I'm Not.
0440241030|4.0|I read through this in a few hours and it was entertaining. One thing I noticed is Child worships this character. <br /> <br />Reacher with a gun, in the dark. <br /> <br />Stuff like that makes the character a little too invincible and is what I call \\"posing\\".
0007205236|4.0|Angela's Ashes was interesting, realistic, and tragic all tied together. It's great for a report or for pleasure reading. I had to read this book for History and my thinking started out that I was going to have to continually shove a chapter at a time into my head and some how finish the 19 chapters in fourteen days. As I began reading I was satisfied to find that it not only held entertaining and personal stories but real historical facts/events. The book never got too dull but at times became repetitive. We also watched the movie to be able to compare it to the book, and honestly the movie came no where close to incorporating the detailed stories a smoothness of the book. It doesn't follow the typical Hero and the Quest pattern, although it is filled with love, illness, death, poverty, and dreams.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|The first word that comes to mind when I think of this album is escapism, pure unapologetic, commercial, overblown, super-sonic, rock n roll escapism. It's not cool or hip by any means and that's why I love it. If you listen to this album you are knowingly giving up all street cred which in turn makes you even more of a rebel.  <br /> <br />The purpose of this album is obviously to entertain the listener and to suck them into a rock fantasy world (not to mention sell a load of albums). The emphasis really is on fantasy (look at the cover). Today's bands should check out this album. Bands today are more concerned with appearing to be genuine, honest, artists who kinda hope their music is entertaining. Tom Scholz's number one goal was to entertain and he met that goal the same way Steven Spielberg directs a movie. If you ask me he is more \\"honest\\" than 99% of today's self-serious musicians who pretend to toss us their little nuggets of uncompromised \\"art\\" without really caring if we likes it or if it makes any money. <br /> <br />I must say that this album has the idealism and fantasy that is completely missing in rock music today. For some reason dark, sad, angry, music always gets instant credibility, even if there is no substance behind it, while bright, light-hearted, upbeat music is considered inherently dishonest and phony. What's that about? Is anger and depression real and happiness just a farce? Ignore that last sentence and the urge to write a \\"deep\\" song about it. Just put this album on and think of a time when rock n roll was actually about entertainment not about image, fashion, or \\"keepin it real\\". <br />
075640407X|5.0|I have been reading fantasy novels for over 20 years and this is one of the best fantasy books I have read period.  It will be a long year waiting for the next book.  If you are a lover of fantasy novels, then this is a must have. <br /> <br />Three cheers for Patrick Rothfuss and The Name of the Wind!!!!!!!
0385333846|5.0|I'd say, quite possibly, the pinnacle of his work; granted I've only read eight of his novels and most of his short stories.  For me, it doesn't get any better than this.  It's dramatic but not histrionic.  Some people do get confused when reading it (students) but for the trained eye it can be a real pleasure.  I've taught this book to both eleventh and twelth graders and each class, more or less, has loved it.  Also it picks on Trout just a smidge (a minor-major character throughout his work), which only heightens the novel for me.  Then there is Dresden.  Enough said.
006117758X|5.0|Man, Bukowski had some life. Growing up under an abusive psychotic father and a mother who was pretty worthless as a support, Bukowski had to fend for himself. He was sort of a bully at school, he develops a tough shell, a psychological as well as physical callousness that is demonstrated in his reactions to other people. This had me laughing out loud on the subway rides to and from work. The dark humor is enough to brighten your otherwise dull and uninspired day. His misery is bitter, how he deals with with it through the alter-ego Chinaski is hilarious. And sooner or later you begin to sympathize with a poetic and tragic anti-hero. You are reminded of the fact that ugliness is more of a mental thing than a physical thing.
B000O178BY|5.0|With teeth wasn't the best thing to come out of the NIN camp ever but it was the signal of a change of direction. Year Zero seems to be following the same style but with a sense of purpose. The tracks are minimal and heavy on the electro drum kits but at the same time there is that lush songwriting and unexpected hook bliss that we all love in a NIN album. The good soldier stood out to me as a rare NIN groove that doesn't explode and kill everyone for a 10 mile radius. Thats not to say that the album doesn't, in fact I think My Violent Heart has one of the best quiet to loud sections I've heard in a while. The album flows nicely (a change from With Teeth) and leaves you standing on a mountain top in some unnamed desert watching the sun set for the last time...
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I have seen every Bond film that was ever made and to this day, Sean Connery has been the only actor I have enjoyed playing Bond...until now.<br /><br />After all the controversy and comments on Daniel Craig's potential as an actor and doubts over him playing Bond...I'd say forget it and be enthralled by the new BOND! He's here to stay.<br /><br />Casino Royale has a strong plot for once and makes it even stronger by showing us where Bond came from and how he smoothed away some of the rough edges. And the edges are brutally rough here. The killings are nasty and the aftermath has to be dealt with in a way Bonds have never done before.  The real ace in the hand is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality, but he's easily the best actor to have played the part. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since OHMSS you get a sense of Bond changing throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to it. It's not just his delivery, it's also his body language. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts.  Physically he's the most in your face Bond and the action scenes look brutal for once.  Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed stuff. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back (it's almost as tastefully done as the old TV version) but that's probably fear of the censors.<br /><br />You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig IS James Bond, but that no-one has ever played him before.  And he does fill out those teeny-tiny blue swim trunks very, very well.  I need a cold shower now.
B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd has always been great \\"head music\\". A lot of time had passed by since their high water mark, 1973's Dark Side of the Moon and this album (1994). If it had been released 20 years earlier in 1974, it would have been hailed a masterpiece. I've listened to this album very closely and still found them to be the best purveyors of head music. I can't understand the cynical and disrespectful comments about this album, mostly from folks who weren't even alive when Dark Side came out. Bottom line: If you like Pink Floyd's weird sounds, and surreal soundscapes, you'll love this album. If you're hopping on the latest bandwagon, keep the negativity to yourself and stick to American Idol. Real Pink Floyd fans know \\"The Division Bell\\" is really a very good album even without Roger Waters.
0812550757|5.0|I loved this book. It is better than Ender's Game in my opinion. Ender's Game was awesome, but this novel is more mature.
0596007124|4.0|The guys at Head First division have done a great job in making reading and understanding easy again. With a confusing topic such as the Design Patterns, they came up with interesting situations where one could apply the patterns in the real world. The examples are a bit funny sometimes but it does drive the reader into thinking about applying OO principles using patterns. This book gets you hooked into reading and at the end you would be a better programmer/designer. The examples are clear, concise and get the point across. <br /> <br />One complain which prevented me from giving them the 5 stars is that they didn't cover all the 23 GoF design patterns in detail - only about 14 without including the MVC. The authors considered some of the patterns to be less widely used in the real world and hence didnt include them with a detailed explanation. A complete coverage would have made this book really really great.  <br /> <br />Having said that, you should probably get this book anyways...It is a fun read.
