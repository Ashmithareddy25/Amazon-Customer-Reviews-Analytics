B008133DO8|5.0|This episode left me on the edge of my seat. It was full of suspense and plot-twists. It was also interesting to see Holmes interacting with *gasp* a woman! The ending of this episode was sad, but with a little surprise. Overall, a must-see episode for any fan of the series. I am SHERLOCKED.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I found this a great time killer.  The rules are relatively easy to understand, but the puzzles are reasonably challenging.  Unfortunately, the game helps tries you by marking some things with cross-marks, but sometimes it makes a \\"mistake\\" and crosses out something that really shouldn't.  The game makes me wish I had a tablet, because it is a little bit cramped on a phone, but it is still great fun.
B007NUQJGO|5.0|Arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Package is easy to open and made a great father's day gift.<br />The album is dedicated to Native American Indians; includes some traditional tribal chanting and of course, the signature style of Santana as the lead guitar.  Love it!
034580404X|3.0|My expectations were way too high for this book..It was a complete letdown. I think that it was poorly written and all three books could have been combined into one with half of the sex scenes taken out because they tend to get repetitive. Something that really stood out to me and really began to get on my nerves was the fact that Christian Grey is a billionaire yet he and Anastasia wore the same clothes multiple times in all three books.  I have no idea why that stuck out to me but it became very aggravating. Also, the story line was very poor for all of the hype the trilogy received. It seemed that the sex scenes and uncommon words were the way to keep you from really catching on to the poor story line.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|After seeing previews for Prometheus, I decided I need to dig back in my childhood and rewatch the Alien set.  I watched all four of the Alien movies in 2 days once I received this blu-ray set, and I could not be happier!  The picture is stunning, and the sound in all of the installments are bar none!
B0072IVGRY|1.0|This is not a review of the music itself, but rather the sound quality.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this LP as well as the new Van Halen LP, so I pre-ordered the LPs as soon as they were available.  I should have waited.  I would have then found out the mastering of both albums removed essentially all dynamic range, and they used that same master to press on vinyl. For instance, listen to this album on a decent sound system, and then listen to Electric right after...night and day.  Choice of Weapon is muddled and compressed with no separation of the instruments and is very ear fatiguing.  The human ear gets fatigued when it hears the same sound at the same level for a period of time.  Electric on the other hand is engaging and tasty due to the peaks and valleys of the sound.  The quiet passages in the music are quiet, and the loud passages of the music are loud.  You can clearly hear and feel the drums, because it was mastered with the dynamic range needed to allow the listener to hear proper separation and full range of the instruments. This is the main reason the human ear finds music pleasing.  Sounds made at the same sound level over periods of time displease the human ear. Anyone remember a teacher who spoke with no inflection in their voice?  The same monotone level?  Not a very interesting class I bet, regardless of the quality of content.<br /><br />It is obvious that overall the market does not demand sound quality with full dynamic range. I am not suggesting this should change or will change. Technology, cost, and convenience will often trump the time and costs required to obtain quality. I am similar in almost all ways except for how I prefer to listen to music. If someone can hold thousands of free songs in a cool gadget in the palm of their hand, it is certainly going to change the way people listen to their music. Instead of spending $15 on an album and listening to the music in a room with their friends on a high quality system, they are going to pop in their earbuds or turn up their 2.1 computer speakers and listen to a song for free on Youtube.  As a result, the sound attributes of the music should then match the primary method of which it is listened. So it is understandable that today's music is mastered accordingly, resulting in very compressed sounding music which is arguably more appropriate for low fidelity playback, and how people now generally listen to music.<br /><br />But then why vinyl?<br /><br />Granted, the vinyl \\"resurgence\\" is not going to make record companies millions, nor is vinyl ever going to become the main playback medium again, and nor should it. However it is a medium that has a dedicated niche following (3+ million new LPs sold in 2011) who appreciate sound quality.  As a result, these folks are more than willing to pay $20-$30 for a vinyl LP instead of downloading the album for free. It would be great if record companies and artist would think more long term on the vinyl mini-resurgence.  They could promote people's willingness to actually pay for music, by creating a separate master with full dynamic range for the vinyl pressing and market it accordingly as the medium made for sound quality, justifying the higher price tag (examples:  White Stripes, Black Keys). Instead of taking the same no dynamic range master created for ear buds plugged into an I-Phone and slapping it on vinyl for $15-$20, charge $20-$30 for a vinyl pressing with a separate master made with full dynamic range.  Folks already into vinyl would gladly pay this price, and it would also lead to more people in the future discovering vinyl and sound quality, allowing for continued vinyl LP sales success and growth.<br /><br />For the purpose of context, I am not some disgruntled 50-60 year old who simply refuses to let go of his vinyl collection in favor an IPOD. I am from the CD and MP3 generation, and for about 10 years I was not all that into music. I then decided to see what the vinyl fuss was all about four years ago.  Because of vinyl, I discovered that my lack of interest in music was due to the fact that MP3s and compressed audio made the music less tangible and less engaging.  It could no longer keep my interest. So if the practice of putting lipstick on pig by taking masters made for low fidelity listening and pressing them on vinyl continues, the vinyl resurgence will surely fade. People who are into vinyl like myself will not buy any new music on vinyl, and the new listeners will never have a reason to pay for music, since it will still sound like garbage on vinyl and you can't play an LP on a Facebook. Then alas, the record companies will have destroyed a sure fire way of getting at least some consumers to actually purchase music.  Sounds like history repeating itself.bout four years ago.

B000G73UEU|5.0|....writing to say this is a great, great CD.<br /><br />Again, one learns the important of interpreting poetry. Reading poetry silently does not work; it must be read aloud, or in this case, sung.<br /><br />Two things:<br /><br />a) amazing how much country/western on this album<br />b) Nick Cave is incredible -- but then all the performers are<br /><br />I was bothered that in the last track, Bono/U2, was unable to blend all that well in the duet. One thing Willie Nelson has learned in duets: let the other one \\"front.\\" Willie Nelson does not fear being overshadowed.<br /><br />Having said that, it was still a great track and the entire album is incredible.

1468161660|5.0|When I started reading this book I was upset that I had purchase a teenage book, something that would be filled with drama and not really very interesting to me.  It only took a few pages for me to realize I was reading something special.<br /><br />1st - and not many people usually say anything about this, I love the way the book was laid out.  Unlike most books which can seem like 1 long run on sentence, this book was broken up nicely into paragraphs and spaces that let you mind think about what you were reading and ingest it before you moved on.  I especially liked the way it spaced out and highlighted the SLAM parts of the book so you could feel the poetry and really see the meaning behind it.<br /><br />The chartacters were real and vulnerable wihtout being overbearing or over dramatic.  Each of them had been through trama and yet chose to live life to the fullest and not let it get the best of them.  The main characters, Will and Lake, even though they were 18 and 21 were mature and made for good reading for adults as well as teens.  The sub plots of the young brothers made for good comic relief.<br /><br />This book took twists and turns that I would never have guessed.  Not sure I was even going like this book, I had order the 2nd before I was even half way through this one.<br /><br />My suggestion is to pick this book up and enjoy it and then pass it along to a friend or sell it back to Amazon, they have a great Trade-In program.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is the funest game I have ever played addictating so fun you have to download this it is just wow I liv it.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Its great for all ages and great for kindle fires!!!! Don't fall for all the other dumb drawing apps, this is the very best and u will LOVE IT!!!!
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|This is fantastic! You're front and center to your own live concert with Richard Marx!  This is a 10 star CD/DVD combo for a very reasonable price! Marx is singer, songwriter and musician with a great sense of humor. He sings his songs, acousticly and his hard rocking style that we all remember and the ones he's written for other artists, too(example Keith Urban). He also adds stories and commentary with each of the songs which is wonderful. A well balanced playlist. Very pleasing to the ears and eyes. The cameramen were geniuses thru-out this whole show. My hats off to them.<br />Marx's DVD goes 21 songs and 2 plus hours!! It's crazy good. I highly reccommend purchasing this for youself either you are a top/ultimate Richard Marx fan or just a casual fan who enjoys hearing him on the radio. YOU HAVE TO GET THIS! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED!<br />All of his music is wonderful and well thought out and arranged musically and vocally. I purchased a bunch of Marx music from Amazon to fill in my collection of missing gems.<br />By the Way, when you all get the DVD in your machines watch closely--You will spot Richard's wife Cynthia Rhodes-Marx (now retired singer/actress) and his mom Ruth in the audience.<br />I pre-ordered my album--the release date was Tuesday, June 19th AND it was on my doorstep 11am June 20th the NEXT day. WOW Great Service from Amazon. Thank you Richard Marx and Amazon for selling such high quality product!!
B005LAIGN2|2.0|I am stunned.  I kept hearing poor Lucas talk about how he had to spend $100 million of his own money to make this, I thought it was going to be bigger than Apocalypse Now or Close Encounters.  I was looking for an epic tale.  I got tail alright.  The bad funky version.<br /><br />The romance in it is downright STUPID.  Yes I've said that bad word.  Contrite as it can be.  Sure you take your black butt and fly over a white woman's house in Italy.  Find her residence somehow.  Don't speak her language not even one word and see if she and her mom fall in love with you then or now.  If this is historically how black troops were treated (and yes I know full well Europe sometimes treated black men and women better than the US) I need more convincing than this cartoonish version here provides.<br /><br />The best actor in it was bright faced young Tristan Wilds who lights up every scene he's been in since The Wire [[ASIN:B005NFJAWG The Wire: The Complete Series]] where he was amazing and if he were white his name would be as familiar as McCauley's was back in the day.  Talk about talent.  Unfortunately Lucas uses him in only about half the film leaving the standard list of black veteran male actors do act about like they have in every other film the same names have been in. Do they think we don't recall how they portray a character from one performance to another?<br /><br />Pretty Eyes Terence Howard, was just pretty.<br />Cuba lived up to expectation decently but never wow'd like he did as the first Black navy diver [[ASIN:B00003CXPP Men of Honor]].<br /><br />You have a team of pilots living at a time of extreme bigotry and the film does nothing to show you how on earth they even learned to fly.<br /><br />You have relatively high ranking black military men and there again the film does nothing to tell you how on earth they achieved the levels of power they possessed.<br /><br />You have white officials who are FOR not against Negroes (the term for that time) but the movie doesn't give a clue how those beings came to be the way they were.<br /><br />I heard Terence wax on glowingly exalting the cinematography.  Is he kidding?  Unless you do have theatre sized screens the planes, the Red Tails then the upgraded bomber vs German plains are way too undifferentiated in rapid motion for the eyes to even tell who's successfully shooting whom. I was lost especially in the opening scene.  Even if it meant the props had to be historically incorrect, the planes that belonged to the U.S. needed to be striking so that our eyes could accurately follow the action on screens less than 40\\" in size.<br /><br />Really?  100 million?<br /><br />If you just want to very lightly introduce the issues these men faced to a very young audience then this movie would have been appropriate but as the go to THE WHOLE UNTOLD STORY type of movie on the subject, which is, I thought this director was promising, its pales and fails drastically.<br /><br />DISAPPOINTED  The Dumbing Down of Amaerica Continues on....
B001O03NCW|4.0|I loved the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou. I especially loved the soundtrack because that's the music I grew up on as a little kid.  My only complaint is that the artists who perform on the soundtrack are not the same as in the movie.  I loved the old-time sound to \\"I'll Fly Away\\" in the movie when the Krossoy sisters are singing, but Alison Kraus covers the song on the soundtrack.  It just doesn't have the same feel to it.  Overall though it's a good disc and I've been loving it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is totally 5 star<br />you purchase coins to get stuff<br />for the game<br />who ever dont have this app<br />I tottally recomend it<br />don't listen to the people who hate it and gave it 1star
B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day is a Timely Classic whose amazing vocals<br />never cease to appeal to all generations.  This album<br />is full of heartfelt songs of love and romance and her<br />undying love for her son....Amazing!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Many people I know are reading or have read this book; curiosity led me to buy it, certainly not the reviews.  After the first two chapters, I wondered what I was getting myself into but not knowing is what kept the pages turning.<br /><br />You need to read this book with an open mind, It can take you on an erotic roller coaster ride certainly, but it isn't all about sex.  I found the characters quite shallow with improbable lives but the complexity of their circumstances made up for this.  There is a single thread of reality that held the story together for me, the common, everyday negotiations every new romance endures.  The fact that the author has made the stakes so much higher than imaginable is the attention grabber.<br /><br />Christian is quite sure what he wants out of a relationship and knows himself far better than Anastasia knows herself.  He tells her about his idiosyncrasies.  She eventually realizes he is struggling with the effects of abuse that began in early childhood, is undergoing psychotherapy and warns Anastasia to stay away from him, but she does not listen.  She wants to change him, to demand more from him than he capable of giving.  Every time he succeeds at making another compromise the more she seems to demand from him.<br /><br />OK, so she is young and inexperienced but I found her naivety a tiring excuse for her cruelty.  To lead a man on after he has bared his soul and torture him is unforgivable.  In the end, she gets mad at him for doing what she provoked him to do, understanding that she could have stopped him at any time and walks out on him when he needs her the most.  Who is the real monster here?<br /><br />I advise reading this book and deciding for yourself.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|ANJ  is a pure joy from start to finish. Their first concert at the Helix was good enough for people to want to hear more, but ANJ put the Celtic Cuties at a new level. From a rousing opening number to the inspirational finale- everything was executed with beauty and precision.  Mairead Nesbitt is a fairy-like wizard with a stringed instrument. Lisa Kelly's \\"Caledonia\\" is the song that made me fall in love with her. Chloe does not disappoint. Orla is sweet with her \\"Kerrickfergus\\".  Hayley Westenra simply blows the audience away with her two solos. And MY last but not least is the incomparable Meav Ni Mhaolchatha!  Her \\"Dulaman\\" is fun and flirty and beautiful. Her \\"Danny Boy\\" is the standard for all other attempts at this song. And Meav's duet with Hayley, \\"The Last Rose Of Summer\\"  is still the best CW duet to this day. And there have been plenty of great ones to follow. David Downes is the producer/director- a sensitive, quiet genius who knows how to make all those wonderful ingredients work well together. A must have for any Celtic music fan The only negative thing is relatively minor and that is that on my DVD, the \\"closed captioning\\" doesn't work.  Otherwise the DVD is of adequate quality production- wise.
B002F3BOS2|5.0|I have been hemming and hawing on this and finally read a review of someone I can trust, his exact closing words were, \\"you won't be disaapointed\\" and coincidentally enought on the same day I saw it for 4.99(lp) in the used rack.  Very very dusty but other than that no scratches or anything so I brought it home and put it through the vpi 3x and now here I am tryin to find the Rhino reissue on vinyl.  Get it almost half off at ElusiveDisc.  As has been said elsewhere there are excellent sonics and stereo imaging and of course the music it self is to my ears lights out, even with the ticks and pops. Thank you internet for allowing this music to continue to be (re)discovered and played again and to the musicians who came up with this in the first place.  I was 1 when this came out!! Now that I know this record is not hyped I am really excited to hear this without the distraction of 41 years of crud that seems to be baked into the grooves.  I am actually gonna get the cd/dvd-a version for my dad because as irony would have it he is more into his 5.1
0307719219|5.0|When it comes to explaining why some nations are rich and others poor, you can hear a lot of theories, some possible, others crackpot.  People love to point their fingers at geography or climate, at culture or religion (especially if it's not THEIR religion), or at pure ignorance.  Other, more thoughtful theorists have developed extensive arguments for `modernization' or at least the need to tinker with existing institutions or to tolerate dictatorships which may lead to eventual reforms.  The USA and other developed nations have spent untold billions since 1945 in trying to lift the nations of the so-called Third World out of poverty. Aid to countries where corrupt elites siphon it off or where organization is weak is mostly, if not completely, lost.<br /><br />If you undertake to read WHY NATIONS FAIL you will get a very coherent argument as to why aid is often useless and why some nations fail while others get rich.  Why did the Industrial Revolution take off in England first ?  Why did Russia stagnate after 1970 ?  What was the economic result of desegregation in the US South ?  Why has Somalia fallen apart ?  To follow the arguments you will have to remember a few (very few) terms that are used by the authors to put across their ideas.  Two are \\"inclusive economic and political institutions\\" and \\"extractive economic and political institutions\\".  That is, some political institutions include a large number of groups and a broad spectrum of people and some economic institutions work to raise the welfare of large numbers of people in a particular country.  Others are run by a small, elite group in their own interests and only a small number (the same people) benefit.  \\"Creative destruction\\" means that while technological progress may put some people out of business (think slide rule or carbon paper manufacturers), the new technology benefits an even wider section of the population, thus being `creative'.  \\"Critical juncture\\" is their most jargonistic term, meaning a moment in history when things change and could go in several, different ways.  Armed with these terms, you'll be able to read this most ably-written and interesting book.  What I liked most about the book is its incredibly wide number of historical portraits drawn from all parts of the world, from the USA, Mexico, and Guatemala to Russia, China, Ethiopia, Somalia, Botswana and Sierra Leone, not forgetting Australia.  This is only a partial listing of examples.  The maps are also very useful.  What I liked least about the book is that the authors hammer you with the same set of ideas over and over.  I felt like shouting, \\"OK, OK, I get it !\\"  The length could have been cut with that in mind.  Whether or not Acemoglu and Robinson are totally correct, I can't say, not being so widely-versed in such theories.  In some ways it feels a bit reductive.  However, I guarantee that if you finish this book, you'll never look at foreign aid in the same way.  You may wind up with a number of questions about US foreign policy too.  And that's not bad.a moment in history when things change and could go in several, different ways.  Armed with these terms, you'll be able to read this most ably-written and interesting book.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I read these out of curiosity and although I dont think it was the best written or most interesting I did finish the series. Unfortunately they became more and more predictable and seemed as soon as it was getting good that was it. It wouldn't go further with the interesting turn.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|The film opens by showing you some unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. It continues to do so throughout the entire length. It gives you flashbacks to a film that never existed and pretends that the first Ghost Rider is entirely different, or was just never made. Hence it being a \\"pseudo-sequel\\". It tries to recap a back-story that nobody is familiar with.<br /><br />Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance continues to add new characters and plot-lines while not giving you time to really care about any of it. It goes from plot to plot too rapidly to allow for time to make  sense of the story, not that it would be all that easy to do so with loads more time. It seems to care too much about the action to even try to build up any kind of depth to the characters, leaving them all very dull and lifeless. The directors of the film, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, seemed to throw all cares away and aim this film at a non-existent audience of mindless zombies who want nothing but mediocre action and second-rate 3D. They seem to think that audiences have forgotten that true cinema is made up of deep, coherent stories and characters.<br /><br />Many people, such as myself, went to see this film because of the entertainment that the first film brought. Many expected a sequel of some sort. We expected the film to continue the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage) and his quest to use the rider for the good of mankind. Instead we got a story about a man hiding out in Eastern Europe, feasting on the evil deeds of people, and trying not to go insane. While people wanted something that was even slightly reminiscent of the first film, they got a reboot that just used the same lead actor and confused the masses.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sparks is a favorite author.  In THE BEST OF ME, it was a  story that I never wanted it to end. It was easy reading and you could feel the emotions of the chacters. With Nicholas Sparks stories you don't need to know  anything about the book, just pick it up and start reading.  You will enjoy the escape and feel disappointed because it ended.

B000EENG9Y|5.0|I play a Jose Ramirez 2CWE (crossover; neck width is very close to traditional classical; the body is different). I'm one to lean on a good solid sound with lighter tension strings. I've tried LaBella Argento (solid silver) as they are low in tension and have a good bass presence.. I was somewhat skeptical to try out the Savarez Alliance set, as carbon tends to produce a brighter treble and the measured tension is higher than the LaBellas.. I was wrong to assume that a lower tension (normal tension for both sets) would also imply that the strings would be easier to fret as well.. The Alliance AR500 strings seem to have more flexibility and brightness.. The next test is to determine their longevity.. These strings sound wonderfully balanced on a cedar top, are a bit brighter in the bass, but very well balanced.. try them out.. you won't be disappointed. It's also noteworthy to mention that the smaller diameter E and B trebles improve upon the string distance between each string.. this benefit provides a little more room to play in-between the spacings with regard to the right hand techniques.. I also do not find that the smaller diameters feel strange.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm so addicted to this series, I had to order the Season 2 DVD in order to watch since I couldn't find it anywhere else.  Season 1 is carried by Redbox, but not Season 2.  All the characters continue to entertain.  There are some who don't make it, there are some interesting twists and turns, and a fantastic ending episode that I won't spoil for you.  I sat down and watched the entire Season 2 in ONE DAY!  That's how spellbinding this is.  I don't know how I'm going to last until next January when Season 3 starts!!  There's so much detail and phenomenal cinematography in each episode, it's as if you're watching a movie - not a TV show.  Kudos to PBS for putting this series together!!  I've never been a PBS watcher, now I totally am!!

B001CBBGM2|5.0|Stargate Atlantis was an amazing series!  I looked forward every week to watching it on tv.  I was so diappointed when the series was canceled.  The show was entertainment at it's best! The dialogue is clever and funny while being serious and exciting.  The characters cover the whole spectrum from the rebel concealing a heart of gold, to the annoying comic relief of the genius, to the natives with their unique perspectives on the war that is being waged, and the relationships between them all.  I have bought all the seasons and when the final season 5 came out, I knew I had to have it to complete my collection.  No sci-fi collection would be complete without this series.  Unless you have seen the first 4 seasons, it's hard to appreciate McKay's new budding romance, or the challenges Teyla faces as a mother and warrior.  And the build-up over the seasons of the Wraith and their evil deeds makes the tenuous alliance in Season 5 all the more exciting!  Seeing Woolsey's character in the earlier seasons makes you appreciate him and grow to love him as the leader of Atlantis in this final season.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!  It's a winner!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a great way to spend extra time. there is a benefit to having a ton of games so you do not get too bored with them.
0345803485|5.0|I was somewhat afraid to read the book due to the review it has been getting.  I talked to an 88 year old lady an she was reading it and loving it.  Then I heard that a 23 year old was reading it and loving it. The story line was great. There is some parts that are kinky but the story behind it is great.  It is an amazing love story.  Would it be as great of a love story without the sex parts?  I do not think so, because it is the sex parts that are vital for the unraveling of the story.  I loved it.  I am on the third book in the series and plan to read them again. I would recommend the book to people.  For those that say the grammer is bad, what book have you read that had perfect grammer?  If the grammer is perfect then the book has no story.  It is the grammer that makes us feel like we are in the setting in the book.<br /><br />I suggest that you read this book.  It is the best book I have read in a long time.

1400052181|1.0|I have to admit that I have not been able to get through this book although I am an avid reader and almost never leave a book half-way through.  I found the beginning of the book where the author details Henrietta's life rather interesting but I was really annoyed by the fact that she did not properly contextualize Henrietta's treatment.  It seemed as though the doctors at Johns Hopkins took tissue from all of their cancer patients.  Everyone experienced the same level of disclosure, basically nil.  I didn't get the impression that there was a racial component to this but rather a class component.  Poor people were treated like this.  I really wanted Skloot to deal with this and she didn't.  I think it would be hard not to tell this story without race being an element, but I felt she so emphasized that aspect that it distorted the story.  My big unanswered question: would Skloot have been as indignant if those cells had come from a poor white woman?

B0013F1D02|5.0|Very nice movie.  The tweens ( 9 yr old boy, 13 yr old girl, 15 yr old boy ) all really liked.  It has that nice mix of things that fit all the age groups - something that is actually quite hard to find .<br /><br />Would not recommend for the younger than 8 crowd.  Otherwise, I was pleasently surprised as we all had a nice sit in the living room and have a family night.<br /><br />Same level as :  Ella Enchanted
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I LOVE RDJ & Jude Law, and LOVED the first Sherlock Holmes movie - BUT - this movie is just plain BAD.  I actually bought this movie in pre-release thinking it would be great and my DH and I were very disappointed.  It's SLOW, dull, you don't care about the characters (even the 2 leads), and it's boring!!  Avoid this!
B0055XCFAK|5.0|The drama continues in season 2. This is my favorite tv show! I love everything about it. The show really keeps you wondering what will happen next. Once you start watching the show you will never want to stop. I love this show so much! It is filled with suspense, drama, and a little bit of romance. A is so cunning and you can never figure out what she will do next.
B005LAII08|5.0|Brave portrays the powerful story about the difficulties a young woman named Merida has between following tradition and family expectations versus following her heart. Merida is strongwilled like her mother and they come to a confrontation regarding her betrothal. Carving a path that both may agree to is the heart of Brave. Merida learns that actions have consequences and may require equally brave actions to mend the strong bond of family.<br />This movie contains stunning cinematography, perfect editing, quality acting, powerful music and a compelling story filled with adventure, surprise, mystique and laugh out loud humor however children less than 4 may find that the roaring bear is scary.<br />I would be very proud to be Scottish today! We absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it!!
B003QOCTOM|5.0|I had some free time one day and I had just finished all the books that were out so far. I decided to watch the first episode to see if the show was good. I loved it!!! I ended up watching 6 episodes that day!! I can now say that this is my favorite tv show!! It is definitely full of suspense and keeps you waiting for more episodes! Love it!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I had heard about Florence and the Machine before this album.  But I had recently seen a TV show that had featured one of her songs.  When her album was on sale, I thought why not get the whole album and not just the song?  I am happy to have done this because her music and voice is fantastic.  I truly love this album.  I don't always say this because I have found that not all the music the artist has on their album is always great.  But I can honestly say, this album is the best!  I look forward to purchasing her other music and listening to it for a long time.
B008B450G6|5.0|This is by far my favorite tv show! I have watched all the episodes and read all the books! It is just so amazing!!! I absoloutely LOVE this show! It has everything a good tv show should. I love the characters and cant wait for more episodes. Season 3 just started on ABC family and is on every tuesday night at 8. Best show ever!
0194313425|1.0|I was looking to brush up on some grammer skills to take a placement test to go back to school.<br />Being out of school for over ten years, I forget things like transitive verbs and stuff like that.<br />I was shopping on amazon looking for easy books to brush up on it. THIS book is not helpful at all.<br />This book is a jumbled mess of confusion.<br /><br />yes, it gives you stuff like nouns, verbs, adjectives and stuff, but it is soo disorganized.<br />just jumbled sentences, no practice and answer in back exercises.<br /><br />I bought two series of this book, and will probably sell on ebay to recoup some of my money.<br />Just beware of this book. I would have had a better experience reading out of my 5th graders<br />school textbook. sheesh.
B002NN5F7A|4.0|Good movie. Good acting. Entire moving takes place in an office setting, pulled off very well, I would recommend it.<br />I would be remiss if I did not mention that my wife was not a big fan. What does she know:)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|= worthless weather app. where did it go? weather needs radar to see what is coming towards you. especially where I live
0143119680|1.0|What a huge disappointment this book was! This is NOT a book you would want your daughters and nieces and granddaughters to read.  We spend our whole lives teaching them to be strong, independent and empowered women only to have stupid books as these come out and take that away! This is NOT a book about true love but a tale of an abusive marriage.<br /><br />The story is supposedly about a powerful witch who is incredibly intelligent, Yale tenured and driven who is conducting research and teaching at Oxford.  She meets a fellow professor who is a vampire.  It starts with the vampire, Matthew Clairmont stalking her, breaking into her apartment at the college and drugging her.  She doesn't seem to mind that any of this happens and falls deeper \\"in love\\". She cuts off all contact with her family (can we say cult), gives up her entire personality to be with him.  Now anyone that has been in a loving, committed relationship understands that they are about bringing out the very best in each other and making each other better people while they remain true to themselves!!!  You don't change who you are to be with them and they shouldn't ask you to.  Committed relationships are not about one parter commanding and ordering you around to carry out his wishes while expecting you to give up your core , the part that makes you who you are.  This book is about nothing but ABUSE!!!<br /><br />Diana Bishop, named after the huntress goddess, not only turns into a pathetic creature who can't breathe, walk or talk without his permission but she turns her back on her own witch family.  I many not be an expert on witches but my understanding is that witches don't let anyone come between them.  They stand together as family and support each other.  There are several powerful Bishops in this book that instead of remaining powerful in their own rights, defer to a megalomaniac vampire that cares nothing for Diana or anyone else.  This book is about honoring only his desires and wishes. He continually orders them about in their own home where they run around appeasing him.<br /><br />You learn about Diana's past where her mother and father were tortured to death by fellow witches of the Congregation.  Diana is threatened and tortured and the Bishop witches response: how could you defend yourself and let another witch who was doing this be killed?  IS THAT CRAZY! If someone attacks and kills your parents and is after you, you don't cry about the people that did it/are doing it.  Where are the powerful witches in this story, oh, where have they all gone!<br /><br />Matthew Clairemont dictates when she eats, drinks, sleeps, to whom she interacts with and how she lives.  Diana tells Matthew she loves him, he responds eventually in kind.  Later on, she discovers that because he responded with a \\"you are mine\\", he owns her and she is now married to him.  He does not ask her permission, does not explain to her what that declaration would mean in vampire world or ask if she would be his.  Instead, he tells her that she is his now, he controls her.  He further explains that he will decide when they consummate their marriage, not her.  She has no say in the matter of when they have sex, again another sign of a healthy relationship!!! The other vampire women tell Diana that in all things, she must defer to her vampire husband with no questions asked.  Where did the intelligent Yale professor go?  Was Diana ever an intelligent, determined woman?  One would not know, because you don't see this in this book!<br /><br />All Diana does in this book is dither, act pathetic, defer all decisions to her \\"husband\\" and eat.  How many chapters do we read about what she is eating.  You can see where this is going?  Women only good for childbirth...<br /><br />Matthew Clairemont also confides in his wife that his first marriage when he was human, mattered very much to him.  He can forget his wife but not their child that died. Again, do we see where this is going...does this author understand the importance of women besides childbearing, it seems not!<br /><br />At the end, Diana makes a promise to \\"the huntress goddess' that she will give the goddess anyone or anything to save her \\"husband\\".  This is not her right to make.  She does not have the right to offer up anyone other than herself as a gift to the goddess!  She has no thought what so ever of her aunts or family.  She does not try to protect them but mentions that only her husband is now relevant.<br /><br />She makes a will at the end and leaves \\"her witch family\\" out of it completely, even though they raised her and protected her while she grew up.  The witches are poor while the vampires are wealthy beyond all means, and yet she only leaves her money to the vampire family she now inherited.<br /><br />Diana is taken by her husband back to the 1500's to avoid detection.  He doesn't tell her where she is going but informs her that he \\"knows what is best for her\\" and he will make all the decisions.  He make the decisions of where they go and she is not included in any of the decisions or has input. She is left to sit with the other women in another room, while the men talk.<br /><br />In addition, through-out the entire book, Matthew Clairemont withholds many secrets from his wife and most of them are things that could help to protect her and those she loves from death.<br /><br />As an aside, this book doesn't ring true in many things. IF you have ever known runners or athletes you know they pick themselves up and try again, they are driven people.  Not so in this book, Diana cringes at her own self and others.  What a waste she is!<br /><br />Here is a tale of abuse, not love.  It is a tale of an abusive destructive relationship to them and to those around them.  It is just another story of a man (vampire) controlling the women around him.  This story has been done again and again.  It is time for a change.<br /><br />Don't show this to the women in your lives!!!  Clearly, the author does not understand what healthy relationships are.  The author doesn't seem to understand what love in a relationship means, no secrets, no control! Maybe she should research THAT for her next books.  The least she can do, is create characters that aren't an embarrassment to women.
0792163710|4.0|I have a large movie library and wanted to add this dvd to it. I have this movie in VHS format, and enjoy it so much that I wanted to get the DVD version.  Movies that are classics such as this one, and movies that I enjoy watching, I like to make permanent items in my library.  This is a great movie and once again depicts life as it was in early America.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book. Couldn't stop reading it. Loved it, will give as a gift. Christian is a guy that was neglected by his mother, but stilled loved her in his own way.

0345803507|5.0|this trilogy is great especially the 2nd and third books. Great love story but the last 2 have more action than the first which is mostly \\"erotic encounters\\". Definately for adults!
0345803507|5.0|Felt a little guilty reading this book. It got my attention and I could not put it down. Have read all three. Sure hope there are more to come.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|This app is excellent, except for the fact that once a month it completely erases all of your data. it's very annoying when you have to go through all of your finances over and over, somewhat defeats the purpose of this app.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book!!! A wonderful story! Everyone men and women should read it. My only complaint... I could not stop turning the page and finish each book in less that a week!!! Lol

0345803507|5.0|This series is addictive. You might as well order them all at once, because you're not going to be able to stop at the first.
1400067936|3.0|John Maynard  Keynes said all of this better 100 years ago, and it formed the basis for his explanation of why the economy goes wrong.  We form incorrect probabilities (with our animal spirits) that cause the problem -- house prices never fall.  Then we enter into a period where we cannot estimate even invalid probabilities so we do nothing -- and the recession goes on for years.  Read the original, he's better.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun I couldn't wait to get it on the kindle fire I don't understand why people are saying fake reviews its the same old temple run than on and I pod i phone or I pad althought<br />n its a bit has redraw Cuz the kindle has a bigger screen
B00881VLCE|5.0|This a great app! My niece plays it all the time. Once you finish the puzzles that come with it you can get more for free or pay only 99&cent; for larger bundles. It also has different levels of difficultly.
0446572993|5.0|Just when you think, David Baldacci has lost his touch, along comes The Innocent.<br /><br />Baldacci has created several series, most notably The Camel Club. After a while Oliver Stone and his strange crew of club members became cartoonish. Apparently he recognized this as well. The Innocent features two new characters who are undoubtedly headed for a series on their own- Will Robie and FBI \\"super agent\\" Nicole Vance. Robie is a professional assassin for the good guys at a federal agency known by its initials. After refusing to fulfill an ordered hit on a mother of two, he finds himself on a bus out of town. The bus explodes, but not before Robie and a fourteen year-old runaway are thrown off it. Robie to his astonishment is assigned to work with the FBI on two cases- the bus explosion and the hit which was carried out by a sniper after Robie balked.<br /><br />There seems to be a connection between all of these events. Naturally enough in any thriller set in Washington,  the course of history depends on solving the crime. Robie and Vance make a good team, peeling back the onion-like layers of the puzzle. The Innocent is one of those thrillers that is truly thrilling. To say anymore would deprive you of the pleasure of turning pages late into the evening. If you have one book to buy for the beach this summer, pick up The Innocent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. The more I play it the more addicted I become and the better I get.
1932907009|5.0|I bought this book based on the recommendation of a member of one the book writing groups I belong to. It tells how to write movie scripts, but the friend who told me about it said the same principles could be used to help make novels better. Since I was about halfway through my latest book, I decided to hold off on writing until I studied the techniques described in this book.<br /><br />Snyder, a successful screenwriter who died in 2009, describes how every good movie script is organized. It is an easy-to-understand description of 15 beats along with a description of each beat and how many pages one should have for each beat. Examples are included to make the material even easier to understand.<br /><br />I could see right away how to apply the techniques to novel writing. However, there are two follow-up books, Save the Cat Goes to the Movies and Save the Cat Strikes Back, that I think I better read before finishing the novel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoyable. A great little game to pass the time when waiting for appointments or traveling. Glad to have it on my Kindle.
0099579936|1.0|I was enthralled by the first book of the trilogy, although the writing is very poor.  By the time that I got to the third book, I found myself bored, and very irritated by the omission of the word 'of'...every time that it should have been in place.  All that I could think of is this...\\"Let's go out the house\\"
B005LAIHYU|5.0|The viewer gets a history and biography of the life of Abraham Lincoln, a compelling story of the battle between Vampires and humans, stunning scenery, and much more. The cast of unforgettable characters are Superb, and acting performance is excellent. A Brilliant, powerfully moving adaptation of the novel aimed to please in every aspect. High-speed action, combined with chills and thrills make this movie very entertaining from start to finish. Highly recommended to vampire lovers, thriller lovers, and all who enjoy a combination of both in a creative, action-packed presentation. Absolutely Stunning!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is so good when I get bored this is the first thing I go to:) you can do so much with this app:)
034580404X|1.0|I bought and read all three books, one after the other. The actual plot line of these is missing and it doesn't really go anywhere. Even the juicy bits begin to get repetitive to the point I had to skip most of them in the last book. If I were to say that between the three books there's maybe 50 pages of plot, I think I'd be shooting too high. Anastasia is silly and her thoughts and actions read like teen fiction. Christian is a character that isn't well developed. Just when you think or even hope there'll be a chilling story, that he might be a Ted Bundy type, what could have developed into a great story fall flat.<br /><br />I felt there was no romance let alone chemistry between the two characters. I give it 1 star for trying...
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I love this game but it wont work!!! I played it 1 and then it doesn't work anymore!!! I cant BELIEVE it wont work now!!!
B003KK65KG|3.0|Enjoyed this novel immensely... Sympathised with Peter all along - not due to his actions but his plight as a victim. The court case, however, could have been much better as it felt it didn't really wrap anything up. The end and Josie's story was very predictable. 3 1/2 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|man I couldn't wait for it to come out finally on Kindle Fire and now its here. totally awesome game. very addicting.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I downloaded this to my kindle on the basis that if the whole of the world was getting this het up the erotica must be good (literary porn as my friend says).<br /><br />Secondly a different friend said whilst it was really badly written Mr Grey was fab and the sex was excellent.<br /><br />I have realised I clearly have more interesting and exciting sex life than the world at large.<br /><br />This book was so disappointing. I got to the stage of not even bothering to read the inane storyline (porn has better pretend stories than this) and skipped to the sex scenes then did not even bother with these they were so dull.<br /><br />Honestly, it was as if the book were written by a 50 year old spinster virgin, as Ana coyly refers to 'down there' and worst of all 'my sex'. If you cant call a vagina a vagina then dont write erotica. And orgasming without any touching 'down there'. It's like a teenage boys wet dream.<br /><br />Had my husband it fits of laughter though. And querying how big Mr Grey's hands were if one of them spanned Ana from hip to hip
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Wow. I've always loved Fiona Apple, but this album is just incredible. I feel like she has taken her chaotic, whirling brain waves and turned them into music. The number of melodic lines criss-crossing each other just puts me in a whole different world when I'm listening. I haven't even listened to lyrics much yet because I'm so mesmerized by the sounds sliding through my ears. Holey crap! Buy this album already!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just loved this book, I could hardly put it down and am presently reading the second book and it is as good as the first. I am glad that I heard about this book by watching the \\"View\\" and they were right it was a great book to read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|you can put a parental control on your kindle so children cant buy extras it will prompt them for a password that you choose and u can also do the same for your amazon account it self.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey or Fifty Shades of Shame? I love naughty sex, even crazy sex; but this book takes away the great  experience of sex by making the female character a weak, confused, desperated woman. I will make this short, dom vs sub is not about controlling a person life, (Grey buys her a car, coach seat on plane, expensive rare books, computer, cell phone)! A child knows whether they like to get spank or punish but Anaistasia can't seem to know what she likes, and only knows when \\"Sir\\" (Grey) tell her how too feel.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have been a Rush fan forever. I have loved most of the stuff they have put out but always have found a few tracks to be duds on every recent release. Clockwork Angels has no duds. It is absolutely amazing beginning to end. It is the first RUSH album since Signals that I want to hear all of Live. I love everything thing about this album. I even like the muddy mix, flashy wiz kid studio production and the cover art. This is the album I have been waiting for! Thank you Neil, Alex and Geddy for making this fan a freaking happy one!!!
B0036T31YY|5.0|I'm not going to say much about the movie, because I'm not the type of person to give away such things.  I would however like to say that I started this movie thinking I'd end up turning it off in a few minutes. It looked like one of those typical \\"lost at sea, how are we going to survive?\\" type movies.  Wow, was I wrong.  From the very first scene I was sucked in wanting to know what was going to happen next and then it turned and twisted and shook everything up. It really surprised me just how good this movie ended up being and I couldn't stop thinking about it after it was over.  I've been recommending it over and over to anyone who'll listen and I even watched it again ...with my parents. They enjoyed it too.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Tried three different times to get the Hunger Games on my grandaughters Kindle.  Charged for all three of them but never did get it downloaded.<br /><br />Seems to me like somebody should have caught this and offered to help.
0345803507|3.0|If you've read the first two books of course you will want to read the third.  Although the books have been successful because they are very erotic, I thought the most interesting parts were when there was a real story with dramatic action.
B007XWFZSA|1.0|There's nothing special in this book - exactly what you'd expect i.e. practice. The author suggests using more of his tools which conveniently cost more $$$.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this game. its easy to use and wicked addictting! people need to shut up about pop ups. its pretty easy to click the little x idiots!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read all three books, I agree with meymoo0n, to much of the same sex scenes, a nice story though - meet wonderful rich man and live happily ever after, not worth the money, other than the sex , just another sunny day in paradise!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addictive... It gets you frustrated and angry which drives you to keep playing till you master the next objective... Get this one and play the day away!!
B005HQ5S3G|3.0|I really wanted to buy this album because I think many of the songs are fantastic...and I was about to pop it into my amazonfresh shopping cart until I made the mistake of looking at the reviews indicating your support of ron paul.  Damn.  Some things I just don't need to know.  While Ron Paul is better than many Republicans, he is still too close to the whack job of the vast majority of the other Republicans who are not bringing our country forward at all.  What a pity.  Grow up Kelly.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok. some of the games are set too hard for the expectations though. I would aorta recommend this game.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I think this is a terrific app. I've tried several different weather apps and this is my favorite.  Very user friendly and I think the display is quite pleasing.  Lots of information about weather conditions.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got it for free at the app store, but its still so good! I love it, and highly recommend it (:
B0052VUNHC|5.0|if you like classic love stories this book really isn't for you. but if you want a \\"new-age-twist\\" on a love story this book is perfect. Beautiful Disaster has the perfect balance of action, conflict, and love in this disastrous love story. i would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want a typical cinderella story.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome!! I cant stop playing it!! :0) I just unlocked another character and it just keeps getting better and better! cant wait until I reach a million points!

B005HSL626|5.0|awesome period. I mean this is like amazing I luv it!! y take it off its fun and addictive! !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the most awesome game ever!!!!!!!!!! I love this game but the only reason I am writing this is to get coins.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|this app is terrible! I just wasted a buck on this game andi already have to uninstall. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it.
B005RUV714|5.0|I absolutly love this series.  Great character roles and acting.  I like the way each character plays off the other.<br />The tensions are very real to me.  I was concerned about the second season being different but not after seeing the trailer and, of course, the continuance of this series.  Thank you for not disappointing.
B004XQO90O|4.0|What would I have wanted to know?<br /><br />That this isn't just some action movie; there are deeper veins than the average movie.<br /><br />What is one decision? Does it really matter what we do and who we influence?<br /><br />So yes, this movie made me think. So beware! if you are in a state where thought is dangerous and possible change a horrible end. You may not want to watch this movie.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This game will get you additive and its time consuming&bull; I give this game 4stars!!!!! Plus its a free game cant beat that
B003UYUQZW|4.0|(Side note ladies-- Mr. Gyllenhaal's slight half smile is to die for)<br /><br />Having said that most of you will probably tune out this review... oh well.<br />This movie, if you allow it, will remind you that sometimes there are greater things than our own petty self interest that we need to fight for; not usually in such a dramatic way, but all the same. It is worth watching.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|I know a girl who is like the character in this movie, and I felt a sort of perverse pleasure in knowing that she is probably headed in the same direction -- declining, losing her perfect beauty, and looking ridiculous in the cartoon character pajamas.  There may be a place for schadenfreude in this movie, and that may be what Cody intended when she wrote it, to show where those really cruel, thoughtless people go in their lives.  Either way, I found the movie very entertaining, and I love that there was no perfect Hollywood ending involved.  Cody stayed true to the character and wrote the appropriate ending.  If you are the sort of person who needs a sitcom ending with learning and hugging, you should probably look elsewhere.  But if you loved Seinfeld and watching imperfect people, you may like this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|He's Baaaaaack!<br /><br />The old King I loved is back, enveloping you in his world and shaking it up, creating a place you never want to visit yet don't ever want to leave. This is Stephen King The Master. If you loved him in the 70s and 80s you will devour this book. Though not a horror novel, this book is fun and suspenseful and impossible to put down.<br /><br />Buy it.<br />Read it.<br />Share it.<br /><br />Thanks you Mr. King, for giving us another gem from your little grey cells.
1451608659|3.0|I got caught up in this book, and tried to imagine not really ever having a childhood. Dominique Moceanu started gymnastics at the age of three. She began competing at such a young age and winning Olympic Gold Medals at the age of 13.<br />We explore her home life, and the moving and practicing. Finally ending up with the Karolyi's and their style of training!<br />Be prepared to wish you were able to help this young child, and then along comes another secret....the missing piece?<br />With the 2012 Olympics approaching, we are given an eye opening look into the inner sanctum of and Elite Gymnast.<br />While the book does seem to keep repeating facts, it does tell a good and true story.<br /><br />I received this book from Simon and Schuster and was not required to give a positive review.

0345803507|5.0|A very tender and sensible finale to the trilogy. It shows the sensitive and loving side of a child lost in the dark side of life who was nurtured with love and given the opportunity to love in return.<br /><br />Lucky Christian Grey, he has love and money and very lucky to find that \\"special someone\\" who is willing to understand him.<br /><br />One of the reasons, I love reading - most of the time it has a promising ending.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I wrote a well-received review about Lionel Shriver's book for GoodReads.com.  \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" was one of the best books I'd read in years, and was looking forward to seeing how it might be adapted to film.  My hopes were not high (I've seen too many made-for-film adaptations for optimism in this regard), but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  All of the elements that made the story work on paper translated well onto film (great character development, the complex relationships, the multi-faceted characters, Kevin's \\"other-ness\\", among others).  What surprised me was how compelling I found the film version of Kevin.  In the book, Kevin was far creepier, and strange in a more unattractive way; in the movie, he was smarter, more provocative, and (dare I say it?) alluring, even.  There were even subtle hints of it visible in the 6- to 8-year-old Kevin [paging Dr. Freud...].  In any event, there was something dangerously and menacingly attractive about teenage Kevin that I didn't catch in the book...but I did here.<br /><br />Tilda Swenton was perfect as fragile, disillusioned, and cosmically disappointed Eva, and John Reilly was the quintessential supportive husband/dad in denial.  Great job, all around.<br /><br />While not a movie for everyone (the book wasn't for everyone, either), it was right up MY alley, and I'll be thinking of this one for a long time to come.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book provides a fascinating insider perspective on the lives of women in our prison system.  It has deepened my understanding of this profoundly unfortunate and barbaric part of American culture.  The writer comes from the upper middle class, a group that does not have much presence inside the prison walls.  Even with \\"high end\\" counsel and strong family support, she is forced to endure a life-changing nightmare of prison brutality and bureaucracy. It brings out the advocate inside, compelling the reader to want to do something to change the system. The writer provides excellent resources for advocacy at the end.

B0081L37Z0|1.0|My husband and I never actually watched the series.  We were just looking for a fun movie.  While we did laugh some, most of the movie missed for us.  We just looked at each other during the movie, like, is this really supposed to be funny?  We were laughing more after the movie discussing how the writers seemed to think streaming a certain word was apparently funny and how obsessive they were about a body part.  A shame really, because I do think the premise was promising as a farcical comedy and it had it's moments.  The Johnny Depp appearance was good, and I think I will try the series for an interesting drama series, but imo, this wasn't much of a comedy.  I regret wasting money on it.
0345803485|5.0|To the people who gave this a book a bad review, what exactly were you expecting? I agree it isn't literary genius but it serves it's purpose. It's a quick fun read. It kept me entertained for a day and inspired a fun evening with my husband. On to book 2!!

It accurately describe this occasion whereby a young professional snapped in the course of a high-flying, stress inducing work environment.

Facing courtrooms, chasing ambulances and get in touch with the regular citizens living in the suburbs.<br /><br />The book climaxed at several points much to the delight of the reader, and has several twist of events which make this book a highly enjoyable one. It's like on a roller coaster on papers.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345536886 The Litigators: A Novel]]
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was not what I expected. So many twists and turns. I ended up loving it but in a sick way just because it was so not what I thought. It will keep you guessing for sure. I don't usually read suspense and thriller books but I m glad I read this. So hard to write about it and not give anything away! I thought it started out a little slow and didn't really get going until further in. This will not disappoint you! Would be a great book club or discussion book.

042524489X|5.0|This book didn't disappoint. Sure I could have done with less Lara & Walker but as a Hawke and Sienna fan that's been waiting a long time to read their story, I was very satisfied. From the moment I read their exchange in Slave to Sensation, these two stood out to me. Their chemistry is off the charts and they quickly became my favourite couple. Not only do I love them as characters but individually as well. I have a book crush on Hawke and Sienna is wonderful. A very welcome and compelling addition to the series.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|While it was fun to visit Pemberley, I was a bit disappointed with this story.<br /><br />This story was well-written, with a bit of wit, but I felt cheated on several levels. The most important level is that of the mystery. I felt that the mystery was not very well-played, especially considering that a venerate mystery writer wrote this story. Was it simply because her publisher wanted to jump on the Austen wagon to the stars, hoping to get readers from across the two very different genres? The second was the opening of the story and the piecemeal effect of the writing. The first six percent of the book was a complete rehash of Pride and Prejudice. There were other parts that it felt as if Ms James was trying to give the reader a load of information about Jane Austen works, without skillfully working it in to the story.<br /><br />What I did love about the book was the language. I had learned a great many new words reading this novel, and I do appreciate a writer that uses words that are uncommon. Ms James does write well - if not know how to spin a mystery well. This reader fell for many of the descriptions of the people in the story.<br /><br />I had expected more of a mystery, not a book about a trial of a man which I could care less if he hanged for a crime that he may have or may not have committed.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|I hesitated to buy this on its release date. My fear was that this would be some cash-in joke in support of their 50th anniversary. However, I was curious most assuredly. Then I had an epiphany, courtesy of \\"Little Steven's Underground Garage\\" radio show. When he played \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" as his \\"coolest song of the week\\", I immediately connected with it. Off I went.<br /><br />For me, the title track has now graduated into one of the coolest songs of the year and in the Beach Boys canon. Their harmonies still stick and it's melodic in the best sense. \\"Think About the Days\\" is as fabulous an introduction to this record as \\"Our Prayer\\" was to \\"Smile\\". Humor comes through in \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" - another Beach Boys trademark. The record gets more thought-provoking towards the end, peaking with the closing trifecta. \\"From There To Back Again\\" lets Al Jardine tackle the lead and he's never sounded more vibrant. This should go down in the annals of their career as another high-water mark. When need be, Brian Wilson still rises to the occasion. \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\" effectively update his \\"'Til I Die\\".<br /><br />Far from being a shamefaced recording, this succeeds in bringing back the fun I had when I intially heard \\"Endless Summer\\" and their great lost classic LP, \\"Sunflower\\". If this should be their testament, they do it with style. Carl and Dennis would give their thumbs up. I'm sure.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I have used SwiftKey for a while and it's a great keypad, but the newest update has a bug where autocorrect and word prediction don't work in the stock email app in my SG2. While the keypad works great for SMS, the very important autocorrect and word prediction features stopped working in the email app, which is a very big problem. I would rate this app 5 stars if it weren't for this problem.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|It's easy to learn, golf shots have been brought down to their basics which is really good. Makes the game fun to play yet challenging with all the different courses and hazards.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|If you were expecting the same type of album as \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" with the lush orchestration, you will be disappointed.  But this album presents a very different and more upbeat side of Melody in that it has more of a Latin-flavored bossa nova feeling to it.  Her voice, however, is still very smooth and sensuous.  Among the standout tracks are the fast-paced \\"Mira,\\" the pathos-filled \\"So We Meet Again My Heartache,\\" the sensuous \\"Impossible\\" and \\"Voce Me Ama,\\" the duet she performs with producer Heitor Pereira.<br /><br />There were two things that kept me from rating it 5 stars, however.  As mentioned by the other reviewers, the vinyl-sounding hisses and pops in Track 3 (\\"So Long\\") detracted from the piece, and you have to endure at least 11 minutes of silence before you get to the bonus \\"hidden track.\\"  That's fine if you're listening to it on the computer where you can drag your cursor toward the end of the piece, but if you're listening to it in the car, the 11-minute pause can be rather annoying.<br /><br />All that being said, it's still a very enjoyable album and one I would highly recommend.

B008D28HYS|5.0|Color adds complexity and the puzzles even more interesting.  The only down-side is the larger puzzles require a stylus to complete with precision, but there are plenty of finger-sized ones too.  Everyone I've shown these puzzles to have also become addicted.  I do suggest reading Wikipedia's explanation as the in-game tutorial isn't the best.  But this is by far the best Nonogram game on the market, bar none.

0385534639|2.0|While the idea for the book is intriguing, the novel reads like a third or fourth draft, and it really needs more rewrites and more editing--the plot needs to be streamlined and extraneous, unnecessary characters should be eliminated.  The plot device established in the beginning--the mystical battle--fails to build to anything interesting.  Overall, a very interesting failure.

One last thing, this movie is NOT intended for children!!!

0385341008|3.0|The Geurnsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a pleasant, enjoyable read. I don't think it's great literature, but it's not trash, either.  It may even be mostly fluff, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />Set shortly after the close of hostilities in WWII, the book is an epistolary novel, i.e., written as a series of letters. The bulk of the letters are between Juliet Ashton, author, and assorted residents of Guernsey, though other writers and recipients appear. Likewise, some exchanges are brief notes and even telegrams to and from other people in Juliet's life.<br /><br />The overall tone of the book is light, leading me to believe that a line that struck me was no accident.  John Booker writes, in his first letter to Juliet, that he has been reading the letters of Seneca, \\"a Roman philosopher who wrote letters to imaginary friends telling the how to behave for the rest of their lives.  Maybe that sounds dull, but the letters aren't--they're witty.  I think you learn more if you're laughing at the same time.\\"<br /><br />That struck me, maybe because that's why I like to--no, it's not that I like to be funny, but that I can't  help seeing the humor in just about everything (including times and events when it's not convenient).  But I had a strong feeling that Ms. Schaffer agrees with Booker, that whatever you want to say, you'll be heard more surely if you say it with laughter. or at least lightness. I don't think that the book has a  \\"message,\\" but it does seem to be saying that whatever you face, better to face it with whatever humor you can muster. And with friends and books, not necessarily in that order.<br /><br />The underlying story about how the Guernsey islanders endured the Nazi Occupation--and how at least some discovered that, whatever evil Nazism held, individual Germans were very apt to still be humans--is strong and appealing.  Juliet's discovery of the Island and Islanders and her growing affection is also appealing, if not 100% real.  For me, the love story doesn't measure up.  It felt predictable and unconvincing. The \\"negative love story,\\" Juliet's interactions with the man she is clearly not destined to marry, is pleasant and humorous, if not wholly believable.  It's part of the humor of the story and as such is worthwhile.<br /><br />The story of True Love is charming and I rooted for it, but I didn't really believe in it.  I could see it coming a mile away, and never felt either doubt that it would  happen or any real belief that it made sense.  It didn't make me hate the book, but it did knock some points off.<br /><br />Overall, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a grand read, taught me a bit I never knew about WWII, and feels like a book I might return to, as I do to many easy reads, when chocolate isn't enough. When other people might turn on the TV for reruns of The Wonder Years, I re-read books that are like mental comfort food. Ms. Staffer's book might well qualify for that list, and maybe that's high enough praise.  3 1/2 stars.0% real.  For me, the love story doesn't measure up.  It felt predictable and unconvincing.

0307730697|4.0|I was fortunate enough to read the book Fearless by Eric Blehm, a story about Adam Brown, officially known as a Chief Special Warfare Operator (SEAL), one of the most respected Special Ops warriors in the US Navy. He worked for the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG), aka DEVGRU. The story begins with anecdotes about Adam's life, his struggle with drug addiction and his life prior to joining the armed forces, all of which contributed to the larger picture of his life story. Blehm does an excellent job of conveying Adam's devotion to family, friends, and his faith. Toward the end of the story the reader understands how Adam's drive, love of country, and desire to serve others eclipsed his physical ailments, emotional struggles, and brought him to serve and die for his country. This story is inspiring, emotional, and a wonderful testament of God's providence. I was privileged to read this book and I will certainly be passing it on to others.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|On Writing is not just for the aspiring writer--but for anyone who loves books and reading. This book will help the aspiring writer spot key issues in his/her work and how to address them. For the reader, it will make you appreciate the craft and the work (good) writers go through from beginning to end. Not only that, but this book will also help you spot those stories that aren't quite up-to-par (lazy writing, repetitiveness, lack of character development, useless words, etc...). This is not a step-by-step guide for aspiring writers (King makes this clear), but what works for Stephen King himself.<br /><br />What I really liked about this book is that King not only discusses writing, but also key points of his life--which I found very interesting. He discusses his childhood and the beginning points of his writing, meeting his wife, the struggles of being an aspiring writer, selling his first novel (Carrie), drug abuse, and being hit by a van in 1999.<br /><br />I found myself not wanting to put this book down until I was done (although I eventually had to due to lack of sleep). I practically hung on every word. I can pretty much guarantee I will never be able to attend a King seminar, or be able to interview him in person, so this book was the next best thing. It's written in a way that makes you feel as if you are listening to him speak right in front of you. On Writing is amazing stuff!

They seem to be the only two white women who were colorblind and totally respectful to the black women (played by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer)...worth watching completely and repeatedly.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|When I first saw trailers for John Carter I more or less ignored them, certain that Hollywood would pillage another work of popular literature. Bored on a Sunday afternoon, I decided to stream John Carter after reading the reviews here. John Carter is based on the first two Barsoom books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, a wildly popular novelist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century who is best known for the Tarzan novels. His sci-fi fantasy/adventure series was less well known in its time, but like the Tarzan novels is still read.<br /><br />John Carter follows the plot and character development of A Princess of Mars and Gods of Mars far more faithfully than I expected. Granted, the source material isn't Milton, but many a popular novel has been stripped of what complexity it has by the Hollywood machine asumptions that American teens and adults cannot follow even the simplest plot. John Carter keeps the plot intact. The look of the movie is perfect as are the two leads: they look every inch the Barbarian Princess and the Civil War veteran respectively. The CGI effects helped the story rather than hindering it or overshadowing it.<br /><br />All in all a great popcorn movie or rental that is suitable for family viewing with children over the age of reason. There are skimpy costumes for both men and women, but no nudity and the violence is cartoon violence rather than a gore fest. Fun!

0765316994|4.0|Redshirts got me. I read it in a day, mostly in one evening. It's a page tapper.<br /><br />It reminded me of Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris -- also a fiction/fantasy past and future kind of mixup. It's a friends story, and a meta-story about making stories and where they come from, and the love good writers have for their people. Sometimes a wise General sends soldiers to die, but only to die for a cause. (One reason I have a problem with George RR Martin).<br /><br />It's also an unexpected romance. And there's something in there about screenwriting too. Also about mortality and living well.<br /><br />It's fun, it's goofy, it's mostly sweet.<br /><br />Sweet, except for the end of Chapter 23. That was not nice Scalzi, and I'm not sure Chapter 24 entirely compensates.<br /><br />Just go with it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|If you're into progressive metal, you may very well find Clockwork Angels to be the best thing Rush have done in thirty years.<br />(Don't have it yet?  Run!  You will NOT be disappointed.)<br /><br />On the other hand, if the Belushi/\\"Riddle Song\\" scene in Animal House offended you, you'll likely wet your panties and scamper away.  Throw in the remaster of Presto, grab a wine cooler and your newest Emily Griffin paperback, and tell yourself everything will be OK.<br /><br />Though not strictly in the metal sense of the word, Clockwork Angels is HEAVY.  A key element of this heaviness is the tonal palette Raskulinecz and the band chose to apply during engineering and mixing.  Another is Alex's sound--some of the fullest, gutsiest guitar presence I think I've ever heard from Rush.<br /><br />Apparently some object to the album's sound, calling it \\"cloudy,\\" \\"muddy,\\" etc.  I think I know why.  Many of us audiophiles, when presented with a new Rush work, are used to quickly boiling away the synth/Alex \\"broth\\" in order to get to the meat and bones, so to speak.  But with most of CA this isn't so easy (fast-forward to 2:50 in Carnies for one exception).<br /><br />The album's richness may present the casual listener (or his substandard sound system) a sonic canopy too intricate to efficiently parse.  Or, it could be that some fans can't tolerate the testosterone boost Lerxst gave his guitar before stepping into the studio this time around.<br /><br />NOW I'm done venting (and scrambling my metaphors like a pig in... uh... broth?).<br /><br />..!..<br /><br />P.S.  The 2112/clock thing?  If you just now think that's a revelation the rest of us need explained, you don't know Rush Fans.
B0086700CM|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! make a game just like it and make it even more fun!I think this is the best game ever!
B0077SGMXM|4.0|Overall, the game is really fun. The controls are all good and there are a ton of levels to pick from.<br /><br />One problem is that it freezes up after a course is completed sometimes and must be killed with task manager. It still saves game data though, so it's not that bad.

B007SGM084|2.0|I have to say this book was one of the most boring books I've ever read! I read this book almost every night because after a few pages i will fall asleep.  I read all types of books, from classic stories to more recent ones like the Hunger Games. I think the only reason this book had any hype was because of all the exotic sex written in it. Yes, every woman would love a charming rich man to sweep them off their feet. it's the happy ending any story book gives. Read this book if your really interested, but warning to those who love reading...this book isn't much.
B007URCTOG|1.0|I am glad I waited to rent this movie... No chemistry  between the leads, and they both were very mopey and unbelievable. Do not watch this expecting it to be like the Notebook, you will be disappointed.
B00526ZKYS|3.0|First, I'd like to agree with the other reviewers wholeheartedly in that the author writes INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL. If I were a writer, this is exactly how I'd like to sound. For me, though, that's were the beauty of this novel ends.  I'm not too intrigued with the 'dystopian' idea of it, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  The plot and characters suffer, where the writing is spectacular.  I think I only finished the book to search for quotes, since that's were the strength is.  And for me, if the different parts of the novel can't come together, then what could be great is only ok.  It's as though it's been written just to have those nice quotes.  There's a lot of fluff and not that much meat. I mean, I really really like fluff, but this novel just didn't fill me up.<br /><br />But I guess what bothers me so much about this novel is that I get annoyed with the main character. I know that Lena is supposed to be learning how to fight what she's known her whole life, but she just seems so weak.  The only times she questions is because of Alex. The only time that she stands up for herself is because of Alex. Everything is about Alex, who is a pretty clear cut character.  It's probably harsh of me to not like this novel so much because of that, because it's supposed to be about being able to love.  But Lena has me compare her so much to Bella of Twilight, both of whom seem (to me) to have no inner strength unless their beloved is around to make them feel better about themselves.  I actually like the character of Hana much better because it seems like she has that spunk that Lena misses.  Oh, and excuse me, I forgot the times when Lena feels better about herself when she thinks she one-ups Hana. I'm sorry, but that doesn't make me feel as though she's growing as a character.<br /><br />That being said, the end of the novel is exponentially better than the beginning and middle, but that means that you have to go through the first 300 or so pages.  But after reading the review for the next book in the trilogy and the review for her other book, I like her writing enough to try another one. And it seems as though the characters come off better (with Lena being a somewhat stronger character), so I'm going to give them a look. *Fingers crossed<br /><br />So, my summary of it:<br />Writing: Amazing, flows like poetry<br />Plot: Ok, a little different from other novels<br />Characters: Lacking
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is fun and entertaining.  you can spend hours earning for the next game . I would recommend this game for anyone who has time to kill.
1595141715|2.0|The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that it is thought provoking but to me it is in a negative manner.  I am sorry if what I am about to write comes across as insensitive, but . . .  I think it is terrible that Hannah is essentially placing blame on those around her, even if they in part \\"deserve it\\".  The problem is, there is no mention of mental illness.  Lots of people get picked on, have bad reputations that they don't deserve, and do things they regret and do not commit suicide only to bring down 13+ other people with them.  Hannah was sick but still, shame on her.

It has more of a story line than the 1st book which is good. As for those people complaining about the repetitive writing in the book, well it's normal for us to repeat our behavior, attitude, speech and that's what E. L James did with the characters in the book so stop whining! Great buy.

Does a fellow directioner want to help me out? Thanks darlings ;) Much love,<br />-E<br />xo
B003YUF0GC|2.0|I do not know if others have had a problem with this GPS Waterproof Receiver or not, but we did. It started out just fine and worked like our old yellow Delorme had for connecting to our laptop in the car and running our Delorme Topo 9 program. It updated quickly and had no problem with quickly finding our place when first turned on.<br /><br />The problem started when we traveled any distance or a long time use. It would cause our program to freeze up until we unplugged it from the computer. Our program would then start working just fine and we could then replug in the GPS and start it up once more.<br /><br />We tried rebooting the computer and then trying it again also, to no avail, as a few more miles along and it would then freeze up our computer once again. Later, it caused our laptop to go blue screen (better known as the blue screen of death). That was when we decided to return it. We sadly unplugged it from our computer and our laptop rebooted just fine and is running again with the old yellow Delorme GPS just fine.<br /><br />We contacted Amazon and got the OK to return the GPS Waterproof Receiver. We did and promptly received notice that we would get our refund and how. Thank you Amazon.com, we know we are covered when we buy from you.<br /><br />Shirley~<br />[[ASIN:B000SM1GF8 Compatible GPS Receiver for USGlobalSat BU-353]]
0446572993|4.0|Will Robie is a government assassin able to calculate, move, and execute his target without much remorse. Then he gets a case that isn't off in a remote country somewhere, but in his own. He is ordered to kill a US citizen. He's told she has ties to terrorism and stalks and prepares to kill his target. When faced with the reality of the situation, he knows something isn't right and decides to ignore his orders and spare the woman and the little boy who sleeps beside her. Unfortunately, a fail safe has been put in place and a sniper takes control out of his hands and kills the woman and then turns his long range sniper rifer on Robie himself. Thus begins a thriller where Robie comes upon a teenager also running for her life and an FBI agent who just can't leave well enough alone. No spoilers here - this is just how the story begins.<br /><br />Told mostly from Will Robie's point of view the story is about an unquestioning cold-hearted killer. He never gets involved with anyone, living a solitary existence. Even his apartment has no personality, very few personal effects, just a generic space as generic as he is. However, with good story telling, the hero begins to change and grow. That proved just as interesting as the threat that he investigates while running from it.<br /><br />At first I wasn't fond of Robie. The prose was as wooden as he was. As the story progressed, Baldacci was able to make me care about what happened to Will, while not making the mistake of changing a killer suddenly to a puppy dog. By the end of the story I found myself wishing for more Will Robie. I also became interested in reading more of Baldacci's work.
B000001FY5|5.0|EXODUS is an album that completely defines not only an artist/band but the generation in which it/they grew up in, the album was recorded and subsequently released. Bob Marley and The Wailers were truly a pop, mainstream phenomena unlike any other by the time this wonderful album was released in 1977 as has been stated and documented countless times. The world was not only fascinated by the Rastafarian beliefs but the revolutionary principals of Reggae. The 1960's & 1970's were truly times of revolution on a worldwide scale & NO band or group of artists signified this better than The Wailers.<br /><br />Time Magazine voted this album as the most important of the 20th century and for good reason, Bob Marley and The Wailers in both of it's incarnations during the 1960's and 1970's brought forth such powerful messages and themes that would do more than redefine music, which it did, but would also become, in many ways, the voice of revolutions on just about every continent under the sun. Reggae or \\"Island Music\\", as it was commonly referred, was more than a genre, it was a belief and lifestyle. The Wailers did for Island Music what Chuck Berry had done for Rock & Roll some 20 years earlier, they become a polarizing and solidifying force of a genre.<br /><br />This album was unparelled in it's effect on social consciousness and it's far reaching implications both musically and socially. No other album had the type of worldwide effect that this one did period, thus the awarding of it's number one position by Time Magazine. The Wailers and in particular Bob Marley became one of the most beloved and respected artists in music history for being not only great songwriters and performers but true poets and revolutionaries in every since of that word.<br /><br />EXODUS is Marley's crowning achievement, now I know many will point to some of his earlier material with the original Wailers line up including the grear Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer as better music and I agree that those recordings were splendid and set the foundation for both the band as a whole and all 3 individually and would be used as a platform for their future musically expressions. However, the greatness of this album cannot be overstated nor underestimated and I believe this line up doesn't get the full credit they deserve for the material they produced. Bob was the leader, songwriter and visionary but it takes a talented group of individuals to relay his message to the masses with the grace that they were able to pull off.<br /><br />This album shows Marley's incredible versatility as a songwriter, you have it all on full display, revolution, mystical themes based upon Rastafarian beliefs, songs of love and passion, songs of hope and happiness. I believe this album is best listened to all the way through as it has a natural flow that truly comes through with a full listen. The epic title track is one of the most incredible display's of musicianship ever recorded and was an out of this world experience live.<br /><br />The influence of this album, artist and band on a worldwide scale has been achieved by very few artists in the history of music and this is the greatest example of what made Bob Marley an artist for all seasons, times and ages. This is must listening for anyone who truly wants to grasp how music can change perceptions and beliefs on a worldwide scale. Time Magazine got it right on this album and when you consider all of the other monumental albums to be released in the 20th century, it shows just how much Bob Marley, The Wailers and their music meant to listeners as a whole.e recordings were splendid and set the foundation for both the band as a whole and all 3 individually and would be used as a platform for their future musically expressions.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|It's safe to say that no matter how good a band's later-era work is, it will never quite be as fresh and urgent as their \\"classic releases\\" earlier in their career.  There will always be that missing element of youthful self-discovery, or rapid evolution.  That being said, Rush's \\"Clockwork Angels\\" still ranks as a true return to form.  Having discovered Rush as a college freshman entering his second semester in early 1991, I missed out on hearing the band's \\"prime sequence\\" releases as they came out (with the possible exception of having seen the band's video for \\"Distant Early Warning\\" back in my youth).  In that sense, though, I was lucky to be able to judge the band's work to date all at the same time, and I was quite excited to discover this band that seemed to take all kinds of mainstream rock influences, and mix them all into a great, career-spanning sound that never felt contrived.  Sadly, it seems that none of the \\"new Rush album debuts\\" that I'd bear witness to as a fan could live up to my initial excitement in early 1991.  The nadir would have to be the midnight release of \\"Test For Echo\\", in the mid-1990s, where it seemed not one of the songs made any kind of impression on me in the slightest (although in retrospect, some of the songs did manage to stand the test of time).<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\", thankfully, brings with it at least a fair measure of that intangible \\"excitement\\" I was craving.  It's not just the hunger for Rush to return to prog-rock conceptualism, a la \\"2112\\" or the \\"Cygnus X-1\\" songs, that produces that sensation; it's that for the first time in a long time, Rush seems to not be holding back, and is really conveying a sense of their own passion through the structure and performance of these songs.  While prior studio release \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" had some pretty good cuts (such as \\"Far Cry\\", \\"Armor and Sword\\", and \\"The Main Monkey Business\\"), there was still some of that leftover \\"polite restraint\\" that was far too dominant in \\"Test For Echo\\", albeit with a decent measure of energy starting to kick back in.  Long story short, the album succeeds in large part because the band is utilizing one of their key strengths: writing really catchy songs that are complex, but still pay some respect to traditional song structures, and performing those songs like they mean every second of it, and then some.<br /><br />Don't approach this album expecting songs that are fully in the vein of their more complex work, even though there are still more shades of the kind of music on \\"A Farewell To Kings\\" or \\"Permanent Waves\\" than there have been in over 2 decades.  The title track exudes the sort of shimmery, ethereal spaciness of \\"Xanadu\\", but in a more straightforward manner, while Alex Lifeson's soloing in \\"Caravan\\" will remind the listener of his off-kilter breakdown in \\"La Villa Strangiato\\".  Yes, Alex's guitar solos are definitely more frequent here than they've been in quite a while, but just as important is a departure from the \\"sonic dogma\\" approach that would typify certain albums.  Instead of insisting on focusing on keyboards, leaving out keyboards entirely, having an ultra-light sound, or going for a dirty, gritty sound, the album is well-layered, with the different instruments and the vocals all contributing to a bigger picture.  And while the band can kick it out bigtime with the expected syncopated power-riffing in \\"Headlong Flight\\", the aforementioned \\"Caravan\\", or \\"BU2B\\", it's the surprisingly high quality of hidden gems such as the poorly-named, but awesome \\"Carnies\\" (which packs a lot of shifting dynamics into its run time) and the incredibly dark yet catchy and lush \\"The Wreckers\\" (which channels a bit of the spirit of \\"Afterimage\\") that seals the deal.<br /><br />While I'm still debating whether this is their best album since \\"Counterparts\\", since \\"Presto\\" or since \\"A Show of Hands\\" (my first CD!), I should note that the album isn't perfect.  While not a bad song, \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" rides the same riff far too often for an over 6 minute song (do love the cowbell though).  Similarly, \\"Wish Them Well\\" isn't poorly written or performed, but seems to be satisfied just being a vehicle for the lyrical content, as opposed to really grabbing the listener.  That being said, the fact that these are the weakest songs on \\"Clockwork Angels\\" speaks volumes of the overall quality of the experience.  I should also note that the lyrics deserve to be credited with managing to both succeed at providing exposition for the main character's story arc, and at succeeding in artfully exploring themes that are relevant to all of us: individuality, bitterness, earned pessimism, forgiveness, mortality, and much more.  It's to the band's credit that they've managed a difficult feat: creating a concept album with a defined story that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls of that type of work.  Then again, I'd expect nothing less from Rush....and long may they continue to meet those standards!

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have heard about George R.R. Martin for a number of years, but had not (and still have not) read his \\"Games of Thrones\\" series, or any of his other books for that matter. I had nothing against him and I rather like fantasy with K Gabriel Kay being one of my favourite authors. It is simply that I had too many other books to read and had never, up to now, taken the time and trouble to start with Games of Thrones. On Friday 14 June, I bought Season 1, at least. The next day, at 5 pm, I watched the first episode, and the next nine followed in quick succession, giving you an idea at when time I finished and to what extent I got hooked in. Since then, I have made up for my \\"error\\" and all of the books have just arrived...<br /><br />Since I am not yet part of the absolute fans, and haven't yet read the books, I cannot assess to what extent the series mirror the books. However, as you will have guessed, they are rather entertaining - it is very hard to stop in the middle of an episode and grab something to eat, for instance.<br /><br />Another strongpoint is that this is yet another series from HBO, which I have enjoyed just as much as the previous ones (the two Rome series, in particular). Arguably, HBO series tend to lean on the \\"realistic\\" side and may not be for the \\"faint hearted\\": the fights and stories tend to be gory and full of sex. This was not a problem for me and it is hardly surprising for a fantasy story set in a world that seems to have borrowed many of its features from the fourteenth century in Europe.<br /><br />A third element which I very much liked was some of the book's features, such as the huge Wall - loosely inspired by Hadrian's Wall and the Great Wall of China - that separate the continent inhabited by the humans from the far north where all sorts of creatures lurk, each one more deadly and horrible than the next. Another of these nice touches was the crows used to carry messages across the continent, allowing the contended great Houses to keep abreast of what may happening a couple of thousand of leagues away.<br /><br />Then, of course, there are the actors. My initial expectations here were rather low, with the exception of Sean Bean, who was just as good as I expected him to be in the role of Eddard Stark, Warden of the North. I was agreeably surprised by some of the other characters, especially the four main Lannisters (the father, his daughter the Queen, and his two sons) and King Robert Barratheon. I also liked the performance of the actor playing Lady Catelynn. I less liked some of the other performances, such as Daenerys for instance, but none were unbearable or absolute drivel.<br /><br />I am waiting with some trepidation for season 2 to come out in Europe. I wonder if it will be as good since some of my favourite actors will no longer be part of it. Meanwhile, I'll go through Martin's books and since the smallest of these is 500 pages and the average size is more like 750, this should keep me patient for a little while...<br /><br />Addendum on 4 July: I have just finished Game of Thrones (the book), which I found excellent. The series is remarkably faifhtful to the book itself, with only a few things left out, such as the two brothers of King Robert Barratheon. While Lord Stannis is only mentioned ans does not appear in the book, Lord Renly does, even if briefly. Reading the book after having seen the series has reinforced my initial impressions and assessment. Four additional actors which I did not mention initially and who seemed to correspond rather well to their characters in the book as those playing the roles of the devious Lord Barrish (Littlefinger) and of Varys the eunuch, of Prince (and then King) Joffrey, rather good in his role of a cruel, mean and spoilt little twerp, and of Sandor Clegane (the Hound).abreast of what may happening a couple of thousand of leagues away.<br /><br />Then, of course, there are the actors.

B008COII1Y|4.0|My wife and I love zombie movies so when we saw this we had to watch it. If you love zombie movies you will not be disappointed. The story was entertaining and the acting was actually quite good. Although many parts can be extremely depressing, more so than most zombie moves I've seen, the end result will not disappoint. They did a great job of taking a successful franchise (zombie movies) and putting a twist on it. Would definitely recommend it.

B005LAIGWS|1.0|I won't waste your time comparing this travesty to the even worse previous film. I'm just going to jump right into why this film isn't worth your time. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a total mess. The story is paper thin and poorly told. You won't know whats going on until well after the first hour, and even then whats happening isn't very interesting. Nicholas Cage is given a lot of crap for this performance and, while he is moderately terrible, it isn't entirely his fault. This movies dialogue is atrocious, sounding stiff and unnatural the entire way through. No one is given anything remotely interesting to say, so why is there so much talking?<br /><br />If all that wasn't bad enough the one reason anyone might want to see this film, the Rider itself, is terribly mishandled. Though the directors were clearly going for a darker, more brutal Rider, this one just comes off as spastic and goofy. Cheesy camera tricks, and the Riders laughable roaring kill any chance of the character actually being threatening. while the effects for the rider are greatly improved over the previous film, all it does is turn people to ash. While that may sound cool, it happens so quickly it loses any impact it might have had otherwise.<br /><br />Now for the few good parts: The fantastic Idris Elba is the only likeable character in the film, but unfortunately is not given nearly enough screen time. The main antagonist, not Roark but Carrigan, early on was very impressive as a villain. In the previous film, the antagonists were pasty emo nothings that put me to sleep, so I was very impressed to see the film give a plain old vanilla mortal the chance to show that he could take on the rider; and then half way through he is transformed into a pasty, emo villain.<br /><br />Nothing about this film works. The action is clunky and unsatisfying. The story is pitifully anemic and goes nowhere. Nick Cage hams it up for all he's worth, killing any chance at a mood, and the Rider is a twitchy,boring mess. Unless you are a die hard Ghost Rider fan, stay far away from this film. If you are a die hard Ghost Rider film, just read the comic, and stay far away from this film. Do not buy.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|\\"Sherlock\\" was the best series of its type on television in the 2011-2012 television year.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make a superb Holmes and Watson.  The creators of the series pay excellent homage to Sir Arthur Conon Doyle as they take his characters and stories into the 21st century.  Note: It really helps to view these with the subtitles enabled in order to understand the dialog that often is quite rapid, especially the extraordinary words from Holmes.
B007SSDBBM|4.0|I love the movie it one of best movies please bring on prime so I can see it always. Thank you
1595141715|5.0|I love this book! It is not easy to read, but I believe it has a very important message, one that every teenager needs to be aware of. I think it is a book that every teen needs to read, as well as parents and other adults, especially those who deal with kids. It is a book that will leave a mark long after it is finished and will get you thinking. It is the kind of book that will get people to change their behaviour and become more aware of how anything and everything they do affects other people. I love this book, it is in the top 3 best books I've ever read and since I've read a LOT!!!! (like thousands) that's saying something.<br />Lastly,<br />READ THIS!!!!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I finished all 3 books in less than 4 days..........of course, being laid up with a broken wrist, gave me plenty of time and I did not have to make up excuses why I did nothing all day and sometimes way into the night!!!<br /><br />These books are awesome as long as you have a very open mind......loved reading each one!!<br /><br />All I really would like to know is:  Why can't I loan this book out?  I paid for it and I think this is entirely unfair!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and it so much fun and I really cannot stop playing it so you should download it now
0393088774|5.0|All responsible citizens should read this book. It is written in a style accessible for anyone, even if you don't have an advanced degree in economics. And its explanation of what caused the train wreck that is our present economy, as well as ways to get it back on track, are founded on common sense. I hope people in the Administration and Congress read it. But if you're a registered voter in this country, you should.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|this game is awesome. I play it all the time and it is always fun and challenging. I cant wait to beat it.
B005LLX582|5.0|I must confess, at the outset, that I am a big fan of all of Terrence Malick's films. And this one just added to that bias. I think he takes the artform to another plane; they are not just movies, they are visual, epic poems. There is absolutely no question when you are watching \\"Tree of Life\\" you are watching a Malick film.<br /><br />But I must also confess that his films are demanding. They're like reading Melville or Joyce. Or listening to Mahler. You have to experience them more than once to appreciate all the subtlety and apparent meaning. And you have to be paying attention. \\"Tree of Life\\" is no exception. For instance, it is not clear, until the end, which son is the narrator, making the movie a mystery in the tradition of [[ASIN:B005MMY5RK Citizen Kane (70th Anniversary)]]or [[ASIN:B001H1SVO8 Fight Club]]. The narrative is non-linear, and the editing feels, at first, random and jarring, until you get into the unique time-space that marks a Malick universe. And the relationship of Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, as husband and wife, is also ambiguous and at times frighteningly tense, as a child's perception of his own parents' marriage often is. All of this requires getting used to. And more than one viewing.<br /><br />For any man with a father, \\"Tree of Life\\" is a strongly affecting movie. I found it hard to watch without choking up. While it was a very different style of movie, the theme of [[ASIN:B0001GOH6Q Big Fish]], Tim Burton's own monument to the complex relationship of father and son, was on my mind as I watched Tree of Life. They were, in one sense, the same film. At least they leave you with the same questions about yourself and your father.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|Loved Borat.... this movie was just terrible. There were about 4 semi funny parts and the rest was.... boring, soooo very boring. I am pretty sure the dialog between Sacha (The Dictator) and Aasif (The banished Dr) were ad libbed, but they all should have been cut, none of them were remotely funny. The \\"comedic hate then love story\\" part was forced, predictable and horrendously acted. I felt this was a complete waste of time and money. Apparently I am among the few looks like others reviewing this loved it. I was amazed, I came here just to read how much others hated this movie because I could not imagine anyone liking it... but opinions are like a$$holes, and I've got one just like everyone else.<br />Awful awful awful movie.

1451608659|5.0|I remember watching Dominique perform at the 1996 Olympic Games and I wanted to be her.  I had no idea how painful her life really was since all we were shown were smiles and great, big hugs from Bela Karolyi.  Off Balance details what it was really like training to become a champion at such a young age.<br /><br />I read the book in two days and enjoyed every minute of it.  I wish there was even more detail about training, especially during the 1998-2000 period.  The secret sister portion could have been limited to one or two chapters.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|Brilliant, insightful and original.  As a history teacher, I will use examples from this book in class for years to come.  As a reader, I was engrossed by the lucid writing and portrayals of the interactions between Presidents and former Presidents.  As a History buff, reading American History for over forty years, I was amazed by how much I didn't know!  Worth reading on every level.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good app all around I enjoy it anywhere and everywhere I go very very very very very good app
0345803485|5.0|I resisted reading this book initially...like movies, I expected all the hype to be just talk and I didn't expect to love the book as much as I did.  When I actually started to read it I planned to just read a couple chapters and go to bed.  150 pages later I still did not want to put it down.<br /><br />I love that the author writes this book in 1st person...typically I don't like 1st person because you don't know what is going on in the minds of the other characters.  In this book you have no business knowing what is going on in his mind...1st person is so appropriate.<br /><br />The dialog is real, it doesn't feel forced or silly.  Dialog is hard to write, but she has it down--you feel like you know these people.  Its nice to get lost in what is going on and I must say I am disappointed when I get to the end of one book.  Hopefully there will be more (Kate and Elliot?  Ethan and Mia?)  There is more story to tell.<br /><br />Its been a long time since I have been so captured by a story.  And I can honestly say I never cared so much about who is going to play Ana and Christian in the movie--hopefully the studio won't mess that up!<br /><br />If you haven't read this book and the 2 after it, I highly recommend them.  E.L. James--thank you so much for letting me into their world :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|relly great game I showed it to my mom and she likes it more than me.. now you know how good it is
B006E2VTG2|1.0|This film is unconvincing and unbelievable. If you like to watch a pretty girl, then go right ahead. Your heroine is presented as invincible, right out of the gate. There is no learning curve, no set of challenges for her to overcome...and thus no suspense whatsoever. Mostly she just wriggles around, getting in and out of places where she's not supposed to be. Action fans, take note: there isn't a real fight scene until the final 15 minutes, and it's nothing worth waiting around for. But Zoe always manages to look good, and that's the whole point of a vanity picture.<br /><br />Then there's the abysmal plot. Zoe plays a young woman who lost her family, when she was a girl. All grown up now - with some training from a family relation - she wants revenge. But while she's told to be a smart assassin, she \\"signs\\" every victim, which should make her easy to find. Could bad things happen to good people around her, because of this? Sure. Thus, through her own stupidity, Zoe's character creates another reason to exact revenge. But since every other character in the film is clueless, too, this takes some time - 20 bodies - yet it's as inevitable as every other predictable detail here. What's more, there was apparently no money left for casting. So we get Michael Vartan, completely miscast and unlikely as the artist/boyfriend. There's zero chemistry there. Perhaps the whole thing should be viewed as an absurdist take on the revenge picture. But don't take my word for it: check out the rottentomatoes website, and you'll see that only 27% of the pro reviewers liked it, and only 53% of audiences. The 4 and 5 star reviews I see on Amazon just don't line up with reality. There are some great female revenge flicks out there -- Hanna and Haywire are two. And don't forget Death Proof. Of course, serious action and fighting girl fans will go back to La Femme Nikita. Check all these great films out, and leave this unconvincing nonsense behind.<br /><br />Incidentally, there are other reviewers here who seem to love this film. Their main protest against more critical commentary is \\"This is just a movie! It's not a documentary.\\" This is flawed reasoning. I would challenge these reviewers to start thinking about what they're watching. Directors have roughly two hours to present a coherent, original piece of moviemaking - a clear time, place, perspective and cast which all function cohesively. Their success can be judged by how satisfied we are with the final product. Colombiana is neither original nor satisfying, on several levels. I think you will agree.
0345803485|5.0|This book was very good, I couldnt put it down. I read all 3 an I wish there was more to read. The storyline was creative and there was never a dull moment in this book. I fell in love with the character Christian Grey! I read all the negative reviews but im happy I ignored it and purchased the books anyway. I actually reread the books again because I didnt want it to end. Im hoping the writer will soon turn this into a movie!!!

B0086700CM|4.0|this game is so much fun...... the only reason I rated a 4 is because I wish that after you have all of your upgrades you still have more things you can do other then just the hoists at the beginning and the wings. I think you should add a objective where if you don't miss any coins for however many miles you will get the objective. this game though is my fab game!
B0054JELS4|5.0|I bought for myself as my own mother's day present, and it's way better without all the commercials. Abbie is my absolute hero. I cried my eyes out when the unthinkable happened to Kate. And I admit to having the biggest crush on Tim. Tony can be a bit much with his outlook that all women want him, and I wish I had Siva's nerves of steele. Ducky reminds me of my uncle with his habit of straying from the topic at hand and going into memories from the past, and well, who could not fall in love with Mark Harmon??? That crooked smile just makes my heart melt!!!!!
B00447G29S|4.0|I love this movie. Seeing it in 3D only makes it better. I was upset to find out not a month after buying it that Best Buy has it brand new for $20 (I paid $26). Great movie no matter the cost.

A grandmother of a very loving child who likes this kind of toy such as Thomas trains , star wars Legos and things that are related.The whole thing is a carry case too so it is not underfoot after he plays with it he usuall puts the cars back and closes it.
B006UKC566|1.0|This movie got to be the worst movie about Greek Mythology Heroes.  Wow, such a piece of trash.  I don't understand how people can give this movie more than two stars on the reviews. Nothing in this movie can compare to other movies like: 300 or Clash of the Titans.  Bad story, bad castings, bad lighting... I regret to rent this movie from the REDBOX.

B004132I20|5.0|A new very enjoyable contemporary version of the famous detective.  Now he's in the 21st century and using cell phones with Watson writing his blog on an Apple computer.<br />Highly recommended for people willing to let go of the more traditional view of Holmes.  We always loved the Jeremy Britt interpretation of Holmes and had the enormous pleasure of seeing him live onstage in London in a Sherlock Holmes two man play with Edward Hardwicke.  We had a chance to visit briefly with him after the play and he was very gracious and entertaining.  Sadly he died not long after meeting him.<br /><br />We do love the new version very much though.  The acting is superb and the adaptions are well done to bring Holmes into modern times.  Prefer this version to the current movie versions.  We have seen all the BBC episodes and look forward to the new season unfortunately not until 2013.

030758836X|2.0|Swept away by the fantastic reviews, I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into this book.  However, It was a real disappointment, a book that pretends to be cleverer than it is.  The story takes frustratingly long to unfold, the plot lingering and stagnating at various points throughout and the characters rambling made me just want to jump to the end.  I saw the \\"twist\\" coming long before it did and dragged myself through the book towards the ending hoping for something unpredictable but it just rambled till the end where it stopped like a boring person mumbling himself off to sleep. Don't waste your time.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Her voice is so sweet and fits the song perfectly.  This song has a good vibe and good beat. It is simple and fun.  No big voice screaming on top the lung, no depressing \\"my love dumps me and I can't live without you\\", no \\"I am sexy and slutty come party with me\\", no \\"some stupid rapper talking nonsense in the middle of a song\\" and making weird noise.  It is just a \\"sweet happy girl looking for love \\" type of song.  Come on we need a more positive outlook on life.  When you meet someone you like just make a move and take a chance, that simple.  Always hopeful, always see the bright side of life.  This song makes me feel young, feel happy, full of energy and wanting to love again.  On a side note, Carly Rae Jepsen is pretty and sweet.  Not exposing her body unnecessary, no attitude, not pretentious. Just so fresh like Taylor Swift.  We need more girl next door type of artists out there.  We have enough weirdo or trashy whores out there to poison our young generation in this country.

030771652X|5.0|SPOILERS AHEAD . . .<br />I doubt that I would have finished SISTER by Rosamund Lupton had I not promised a friend I would read it.  Up until the last 30 pages or so, it really depressed me---not the usual sort of book I read at all.<br />That said, I immediately liked the point of view of the narrator, the narrative style, and thought it was an unusual way to tell a story---first person narrative and as an epistle to her missing then murdered sister.  For me, the gloom was only relieved infinitesimally by glimpses into the force for good and free spirit her sister had been---and the interesting behavioral and genetic information that was part of the narrator's journey of discovery.  Too, the uptight narrator grew and unwound as her investigation progressed. My interest was piqued and I learned a good bit I hadn't known prior to reading SISTER, so I read on taking frequent breaks and keeping something light and airy either on the tube or music-wise.<br />I'm very glad I stuck with it because everything came together for me during the aforementioned final 30 pages or so, hence my high rating.  (The experience reminds me of sticking with 2 seasons of THE KILLING on AMC for a similar payoff in the final three episodes.)<br />SISTER will take you on a journey on which you may not want to go, but you will be a better informed, possibly richer person for having put forth the effort.
0345803485|3.0|For the first time writer, she is ok. The writing style maybe bad, but the story overall is good, in my opinion. Although, I was annoyed how she continue to repeat certain words, for example, \\"gasps\\" \\"whispers\\" and \\"murmur\\" in each page, and throw up random words from the dictionary.<br /><br />I was not a fan of Ana until the end of the book, when she started to actually think maturely (kind of). I think the book would be better without her annoying \\"inner goddess\\".<br /><br />Christian grew on me, first I thought he was a creepy controlling stalker that happens to be a multi-millionaire. Then throughout the book he becomes mysterious and I wanted to find out what is his dark secret. Gradually he starts to open up to Ana, and reveals a bit of his past.<br /><br />Some people are ashame to read the trilogy because of bad reviews/ratings and the BDSM (actually, there's a lack of BDSM). I also thought the book will be horrible, but it was not so bad. I have skipped the sex scenes since I got annoyed reading it three times per chapter.
1400069289|3.0|I went back and forth between three and four stars on this book because it is exciting reading but, as many readers have noted, it stays on generalities that are exciting but of very little use in promoting actual change. In my case, I would've loved to have learned some ideas on how to teach children to acquire effective habits and I would've also liked more specific instructions on how habits are changed. In this, I was somewhat disappointed. I would encourage anyone who is interested in behavioral changes to read this book because I think it's pointed in the right direction and gives you a sense of what can be accomplished with an increase in self awareness and the acquisition of healthy habits but it leaves you looking elsewhere for more practical solutions.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app. I have it on both my Kindle and my android phone. It has 3 difficulty levels more options I enjoy.
B005HSL626|3.0|ok...so people are complaining how the ads are a bit sketchy and gross....I get you and how you feel.  Here's a bit of advice,  there's also a .99 cent  version of the game so you should just by that one and unistall the free one.
0345803485|1.0|Sigh. What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I was skeptical about this book due to all the hype, and because I'm an avid romance reader.  This book completely lived up to all of my unexpectations.  The writing was horrible, too many phrases were too overused, a student in 2011 didn't have her own computer or even her own email address, Christian's abuse tendencies made him a completely despicable leading man, Ana was a boring and tepid leading lady, and worst of all, the sex scenes were also boring and tepid.  And the only thing humorous about this book was the writing style and the author's depictions about what she thinks a conversation between American adults sounds like.<br /><br />For all of the readers who used this book to break into the romance scene, please do not base all romance books on this one.  There are many romance/erotica authors who are way more deserving of being on best-seller lists that E L James:<br /><br />Nora Roberts, Lori Foster, Christina Dodd, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Christine Feehan, Kresley Cole, Anne Rice<br /><br />If you want to get your fill of good sex and great romance, put aside E L James and try one of the above authors. You can thank me later.

B00007GZR5|4.0|Whenever Robin Williams stars in a film that is out of the ordinary of his comedic roles, he shows what acting is about.  \\"What Dreams May Come\\" is one of the examples of Williams's diverse filmography that surpasses the humor he is so well know for.  The film focuses on how one handles grief and loss, but what is unique is how it is approached -- much like an artist's blank canvas.  As personal expressions are interpreted within the canvas in the form of colorful and emotional images, one realizes that the memories and the images can forever be embedded within the frame of a canvas.  For Williams's character Chris, that appears to be the case but not quite coincidental because his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) was an artist.  Chris and Annie's subject on the canvas is coming to terms with their children's death.<br /><br />Through present events and flashbacks before the loss, Director Vincent Ward shows that Chris and Annie lived an average life.  Their life changes after their children's accident and the quick turn of events that have Chris, especially Annie struggling to overcome their grief.  Certain parts of the film may pay reminders to other films that depict characters encountering or about to encounter life changing moments, \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" \\"City of Angels,\\" \\"Heaven Can Wait,\\" and \\"Meet Joe Black.\\"  Indeed, all of these films possess a metaphysical quality, but \\"What Dreams May Come\\" may stand out from all of the above.  Chris appears to be in limbo between heaven and hell, and it is where he first ends up that looks like paradise - his wife's paintings, beautiful and celestial.  However, he is not alone in his journey and is accompanied by the first doctor that he had interned with, Albert (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  And one wonders of the significance of each and every character or events that Chris experiences, which may make the viewer think beyond appearances.  Ward is very suggestive of the storyline that delves much deeper into the examination of natural order and choice and how it relates to how individuals deal with loss.<br /><br />\\"What Dreams May Come\\" is thought provoking and questions may arise throughout the film and after.  So many words can describe the story being told within the film, but one phrase comes to mind, life is like a painting.f natural order and choice and how it relates to how individuals deal with loss.<br /><br />\\"What Dreams May Come\\" is thought provoking and questions may arise throughout the film and after.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is certainly one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  The writing style was too simplistic for me and I felt the author would have done well to use a thesaurus so as not to continue using the same words over and over.  Frankly, any feelings of erotica that the book was supposed to evoke were lost on me because I was so irritated with the writing, the contrived plot, and the overly drawn out story.  This book should have been a short story (preferably written by someone else).  The fact that this book is one of a trilogy baffles me.  The author beat the story to death in this book and I found that to be irritating.  I imagine this book was published because the plot and subject matter are taboo and not usually found in literature.  However, a void in the market is no reason to throw all literary integrity out the window and that is what this author did.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|A biographical recounting and an inspirational adventure that is part scientific dissertation and mostly a meandering pub tale that's worth at least two drinks.<br /><br />The story starts with Christopher McDougall's desire to run without injuring himself, to the history of the Tarahumara tribe and how running has improved their quality of life, to outrageous experiences of long-distance runners that Christopher meets along the way and culminating in a race across some of the harshest evironment in the world.<br /><br />The only thing more epic than the race itself is the story of how it began.

I will purchase the last book in the series per my daughter's comment that it was her favorite.<br /><br />This book was good but it may have been the novelty of the first book allowing it to be more interesting. My daughter enjoyed the last book more than the previous two.

Once I finally gave in and started reading, I was hooked!!  I read this book in about 2 weeks - it is long.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and quickly started reading Book 2 when I finished this book.  I highly recommend reading this book no matter what your normal favorite type of book.  It is worth the read!

B005LZW8FO|5.0|Beautiful movie.  First read about it in a magazine and not only wanted to see it, I wanted to love it.  Had to wait a while but finally I had my chance.  Watched it and really, really liked it, but 'love' . . .? a slow and quiet movie.  Then, the end.  The last 20 seconds of this movie are as fine an example of the movie-making art as you will ever see.  Had to rewind it 12-15 times.  Just when I thought I had fully digested the last images, I noticed one other tiny detail.  Another 7-8 rewinds. Absolutely love this movie.
0393088774|5.0|End This Depression Now by Paul Krugman Nobel Laureate in Economics<br /><br /> Paul Krugman presents evidence that to end this fiscal recession--which he calls depression because of lack of jobs and that is going on on four years and an increase in income inequality--we need new fiscal policies.  A fiscal stimulus that helps the economy to add jobs--contrary to what some people will say, the first stimulus did not work because it was not strong enough--and that to reduce the deficit lowers growth, especially in the near term.<br /><br /> The Book specifically discusses two different and opposing points of view: the first, preached by John Maynard Keynes' 1936 work, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money<br /> \\"The outstanding faults of economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary an inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes.\\" John Maynard Keynes'  General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money<br /><br />Although income inequality is hard to solve, unemployment is not. Krugman cites the example of the US entry into WWII where a burst of federal spending cause a 7% rise in the total number of jobs in America.  The equivalent of adding more than 10 million jobs today.  Krugman supports his beliefs in this policy by the Paul Samuelson textbook, Economics first published in 1948 which brought Keynesian economics to American colleges.<br /><br /> The second opposing theory is championed by Milton Friedman.  Friedman's challenges to what he later called \\"naive Keynesian\\" (as opposed to New Keynesian) theory began with his 1950s reinterpretation of the consumption function, and he became the main advocate opposing activist Keynesian government policies. In the late 1960s he described his own approach (along with all of mainstream economics) as using \\"Keynesian language and apparatus\\" yet rejecting its \\"initial\\" conclusions. During the 1960s he promoted an alternative macroeconomic policy known as \\"monetarism\\". He theorized there existed a \\"natural\\" rate of unemployment, and argued that governments could increase employment above this rate (e.g., by increasing aggregate demand) only at the risk of causing inflation to accelerate. He argued that the Phillips curve was not stable and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation (high unemployment with high inflation). Friedman argued that, given the existence of the Federal Reserve, a constant small expansion of the money supply was the only wise policy.  This obviously was proven wrong at The Clinton Administration.<br /><br /> The mess we're in now--his great depression--was caused by several acts of Congress.  Carter aided to the problem in 1980 when he passed the Monetary Control Act, which ended regulations that prevented banks on many kinds of deposits.  Reagan gave the another blow with the Garn-St. Germain Act of 1982, which relaxed restrictions on the kinds of loans banks could make.  And finally, the dissolution of the Glass-Seagal Act of 1933 which was overturned by Congress in 1999 under President Clinton so that Citibank and Travelers could merge--which was illegal until then, because banks could not use depositors money to invest in the market.<br /><br /> The result was an increasingly unregulated system in which banks were free to give in fully to the overconfidence that the quiet period had created. Debt soared, risks multiplied, and then, the housing bubble burst and brought the system down.<br /><br />  Mr Krugman then walks us, in plain and easy language, to the way forward.  \\"Our priority must be to get ourselves back on the path to growth;  every day that we lag behind normal production levels only adds to the astronomical economic loss of this depression.\\"  What we need for rapid, powerful recovery is precisely what got us out of The Great Depression--a burst of government spending to jump-start the economy.  \\"...your spending is my income.\\"<br /><br /> Arguing both sides of the economic policies: Keynes' 1936 work, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money and Milton Friedman's ideas which are causing European economies to be austere and depressed growth (and we know how bad that is going), Friedman talks about inflation, the deficit, deregulation. Friedman addresses them head-on until he crushes his opponents and delivers the knockout blow.<br /><br /> I think this is a must read for everyone who wants to make a difference in the 2012 Presidential election.ic policies: Keynes' 1936 work, General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money and Milton Friedman's ideas which are causing European economies to be austere and depressed growth (and we know how bad that is going), Friedman talks about inflation, the deficit, deregulation.

0060557818|3.0|Although I never think of myself as someone who enjoys fantasy, everytime I read a book in the fantasy genre, I find that I just fall in love with it. Neverwhere was no exception. The main character of Neverwhere, Richard Mayhew, is struggling with the \\"is this all there is\\" feeling when, suddenly, he finds that this is not all there is and in fact there is a magical world, a London Below, underneath the London he is familiar with. I enjoyed the fact that like all good fantasy novels there was a quest that the main character had to achieve, but I also enjoyed that the purpose of the quest grew hazy at times and the motives of each character were ambiguous. I also enjoyed that there were certain sections of the book which led you to question whether Richard was in fact experiencing some magical alternate reality or was, in fact, merely experiencing an emotional break down and a life as a homeless person. I certainly know that now everytime I see a person panhandling or sleeping in a door way I will have to talk myself out of asking if they know the secrets of another world.

B004EJUMT2|4.0|Sweden's Ghost has been receiving a lot of hype and attention in the Metal community since they release their first album Opus Eponymous. Metal music magazines talk often about them and Metallica's James Hetfield is a fan of the band. You'd expect perhaps something heaver based on their image but Ghost's sound is awesomely retro Classic Rock/Metal and from the first listen of the Classic Rock-like \\"Ritual\\" I was converted to the band. After checking out just one more song I knew I had to own Opus Eponymous. There's a whole mystique about the band. A sort of who's behind the mask type of thing that KISS had for years and they are \\"nameless ghouls\\". They have a Satanic image (and are open about it in their music too with overtly Satanic lyrics and themes found throughout their songs) complete with the singer dressed as an evil version of a pope complete with makeup (said to be Tobias Forge) as he is accompanied by hooded figures as the backing musicians. Its stuff that would scare your mother, you know? That kind of stuff. It doesn't matter if it's a gimmick or not; the music stands on its own.<br /><br />\\"Deus Culpa\\" is a brief piece that sets the tone for what is to follow, nothing less nothing more. Doesn't really count as a \\"song\\" here in my opinion but as a creepy introduction the album/Con Clavi Con Dio it works rather well. \\"Con Clavi Con Dio\\" is where the album really begins and right away you know what you're in for, a little satanic lyrically, classic rock riffs etc. it sets the tone really well and enough good things have been said about this one. For me the 1-2-3 punch of \\"Ritual\\", \\"Elizabeth\\" and \\"Stand By Him\\" is amazing, one fantastic song after the other. \\"Ritual\\" is the song that got me into Ghost so obviously I love it. I couldn't believe that the picture of the band I was looking at was playing this kind of Classic Rock fueled music and the singer's high and very clear vocals were a surprise to me along with the Black Sabbath meets Blue Oyster Cult type of riff. Never has a song about human sacrifices, Satan and rituals sounded so... clear and happy? \\"Elizabeth\\" stands as my favorite track on Opus Eponymous. A song about countess Elizabeth Bathory's bloody and cruel yet fascinating story and Ghost's take on it is . The riffs and drums work complete each other so well and the way the vocals just lay perfectly on top of it, the breakdown, the creepy keyboard/organ makes this one the true gem of the album in my opinion. \\"Stand By Him\\" has an extremely catchy chorus mixed with superb guitar work the song just grabs you, probably the catchiest one. I bet everyone will be singing or humming the \\"it's the night of the witch, night of the witch tonight\\" part for some time after hearing. \\"Satan Prayer\\" has a cool creepy vibe going on and is another solid tune. \\"Death Knell\\" is the only song I didn't enjoy as much, it doesn't really kick in and is repetitive and a tad boring. \\"Genesis\\" is an instrumental piece that's epic and great, reminiscent of great instrumentals like \\"Transylvania\\" by Iron Maiden (and the guitar work on \\"Alexander The Great\\"). It's an actually good, enjoyable instrumental song. Overall the album runs short at little over 30 minutes and 9 songs reminiscent of old days of music.<br /><br />I can see how the singer's vocals would be a turn off to some, but I prefer this type of vocal style over growling Death Metal like ones that I expected upon seeing pictures of the band. I must give credit where credit is due, the guitar paying is nothing short of excellent; it's crunchy, heavy a la Black Sabbath and with the bass completes a cool groove. Oh! And the drums are quite good too, simple, direct, effective and to the point. The slight psychedelic feel, touches of organ here and there are welcomed as well. The albums sounds very 1970's and even the album cover reflects that. I think the most surprising thing is the music has melody and hooks and with the vintage 70's metal sound it stands out from today's bands. They have some Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Voivoid and Mercyful Fate influences going on and more (even 70's pop). On a side note the album cover is cool, it's a vintage looking album cover and very Metal.<br /><br />This will vary from one person to another but I can't say that I'm a fan of the satanic elements in Ghost's music, sometimes it dabbles on the silly (or is it? There's no winks, no indication of sarcasm, no tongue in cheek, this band seems to mean what they say) but the music is admittedly excellent and catchy. I bought purely based on the merits of \\"Ritual\\" and I was impressed overall, I'm a fan and can't wait for some more Ghost. It's cool to see a band today giving nods to those influential bands and music that I like and playing in a similar style but still being their own thing. The album is just over thirty minutes and could have used a cover song perhaps (they did a neat job of making The Beatles' \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", maybe on their next album?). Ghost has been receiving quite a bit of attention from Major Metal magazines and there's a lot of hype surrounding them. Some reviewers praise the band and some reviewers hate Ghost for certain reasons; ultimately you should check out the samples and decide for yourself. Opus Eponymous is not a 5 stars album for me but I will give it a close 4 ½ stars for I was pleasantly surprised and found myself a little surprised, I really enjoy the songs and some of them get stuck in my head often. One thing remains, Ghost's debut Opus Eponymous is probably the album I've gotten more enjoyment out of recently and out of new bands for some time. 4 ½ stars.s bands.

B007RE0SCW|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite of the Dead Tired Dolls or 2012. She comes as shown with her compact and was reasonably priced through Amazon. It is nearly impossible to find any Clawdeens where I live, so this was a great find!
0525478817|5.0|On the night I came upon The Fault in Our Stars, I was feeling rather down, and was looking for a book that would fit my mood, and possibly make me shed a few tears. I never expected to literally, Literally fall in love. I fell in love with every little detail of this book, and that is not something that I ever do. I read loads of books for fun, and have never come across anything that even comes within a mile of being as profound, witty, and touching as this book was. I had never read any of John Green's books, or even heard of him, so coming across his clever, intelligent, thought-provoking writing was basically a God-send. I don't know if words are able to describe how amazingly incredibly this book was, but this review, my first-ever, by the way, is my attempt to do just that. It doesn't matter if you don't like to read, because you will love this book. I mean, really, I honestly don't know anyone that couldn't. Anyways, if you are on the edge about reading this, don't be, because, quite frankly, you will be a better person for having read it. I don't know if I will ever be able to read another book again, because I know that this was one of those once-in-a-lifetime type of things, and I will never feel this way about a piece of literature again.
0061743526|5.0|The best way I can think of to describe \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is that Harper Lee has managed to take a period of time from the 1930's Deep South and transform that into a novel. From the reviews I've seen, the depth with which this novel is written is often understated. The setting and the characters are so well drawn, and done so subtly, that I couldn't help but be pulled in.<br /><br />I also find that reviews understate the scope of the story. Alot of the time people focus on the trial, and the theme of racism, but it's so much more than that. The story touches on issues of gender, class, and religion. It touches on compassion and empathy, and justice. But, as with all detailed, complex, and well-realised stories, there's a greater depth to things, despite how simple everything seems on the surface.<br /><br />There are two plots here. The first, introduced in the opening chapter, spans the whole novel. It's through this plot that the entire story moves. We get to see and experience life in Maycomb, as well as the children's quest to see Boo Radley. Basically, this plot is character-driven. This story is subtle; it's something you'll probably understand from the read, but will have to think about to articulate it.<br /><br />The second plot is the trial. While this is, essentially, the heart of the book, it couldn't be written this well without everything else. This is introduced subtly, and is built-up over the course of the story. This is really done quite well; Lee starts with small details, then the details and events get increasingly larger, more immediate, more important. More background is established, and everything is made clear. One event leads to another, and I was dragged along with it. Even when the narrative isn't focused on the trial, it has a purpose, albeit an indirect one. It's like easing into a warm bath.<br /><br />The writing is consistently tight. I don't recall seeing an unnecessary word, or a poorly written sentence, and I'm a pedant about these things. Everything on the page, every scene, has relevance; the amount of space given to it is, more or less, directly proportionate to the importance of what's happening. And even though long periods of time are often skipped or reduced into a paragraph or two, the shift in time is worked smoothly.<br /><br />The characterisation is also great. I found almost all the characters compelling in their own way. They're complex people, and almost all the character cast are sympathetic in one way or another. There's also alot of conflict, and moral dilemmas on top of that. All of the main characters are written excellently, with a resonating solidity. And when these characters are going through tough moments, and being torn apart inside, we're not beaten over the head with it. It's handled delicately, yet the narrative doesn't wallow in it, and Lee isn't concerned with emotional dramatics.<br /><br />And the social commentary is great. Some may complain about preaching to the choir, but I feel an ever-present reminder is appropriate given the frequency with which the message can be conveniently ignored. But again, we're not beaten over the head with the themes, they're just often present. Not to mention that the message is conveyed precisely, and with such an underlying strength to add to the book's power.<br /><br />Combine all these together, and you end up with a formidable book. I thoroughly enjoyed this, found the story engaging, and looking back my fondness of it only grows.<br /><br />5/5

B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar Animation Studios has always been known for their unique approach to filmmaking. They have always put the story first and foremost, something that so many other studios seem to take for granted. They also know the rest of the ingredients to add to make their films stand out from the rest: Great characters, lots of heart, and a goodly quantity of humor.<br /><br />While not continuing the 21st century tradition of turning the fairy-tale on its head, as in the case of \\"Shrek\\", \\"Brave\\", feels like a rediscovered story by Grimm's with an unmistakably Pixarian flavor. Legends and myths abound in Scots folklore, and the writers at Pixar didn't have far to go in order to come up with their own story, one that is at once relevant, quite original, and yet entirely congruous with one's expectations of the perfect fairy-tale. As fresh and surprising as any of the studio's previous successes, I enjoyed it immensely, and could watch it many times over without growing tired of it. It's hard to find a real family film that everyone can enjoy together, but this one comes pretty to close to that ideal.<br /><br />In the ultimate cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for, the film, set in 10th century Scotland, concerns Princess Merida, a feisty, strong-willed, adventure-seeking lass, skilled with both a sword and a bow and arrow, who would rather practice archery and ride through the woods with her horse, Angus, than follow the path desired for her by her parents; or more specifically, her mother. Determined to avoid her fate, she runs away, and manages to find a way to alter her destiny. To make a long story short, this ill-chosen wish sets off a chain of events that threaten to destroy everything Merida holds dear and the entire kingdom of DunBroch along with it.<br /><br />This fresh take on a typical princess character pleasantly surprised me, as well as the fact that the emotional core of the film, as well as most of the plot, stems not from a romantic relationship between prince and princess, but from the mother/daughter relationship between Merida and Queen Elinor. Anyone who is a daughter like I am will easily relate to how complicated the bond can be between a mother and her child, and this film portrays that unique bond beautifully. Without giving too much away, it is their love for each other and their clashing of personalities that ultimately moves the entire film forward, and the changes they both experience throughout the course of the film give them both a better understanding of each other, and emphasize the importance of empathy, bravery, courage, family, and love.<br /><br />Not content with just being an entertaining theatrical experience, the film goes into a level of moral and emotional depth that even fans of Pixar may be unfamiliar with. It takes a very special film to bring me to tears, and I was moved quite often. Not to say that \\"Brave\\" is strictly a tear-jerker, because it is not. I'd estimate that there is more action, adventure, and humor than in any other Pixar movie to date.<br /><br />There is no doubt that \\"Brave\\" is one of Pixar's most beautifully animated films. The amount of detail is simply brilliant, and computer technology being what it is today, there are times when the visuals on screen almost rival the real world. I've never been to Scotland, but the richness and beauty of the country expressed in the film makes me feel as if I had. The landscapes are simply breathtaking, and so photo-realistic you might feel as if you've just fallen into the wilds of the Highlands; I'm sure that more than one viewing would be needed to absorb it all. The rendering on the hair and fabric is especially lifelike, and certain scenes involving non-human characters might make you do a double-take, they appear so true-to-life!<br /><br />Composer Patrick Doyle's score is appropriately Scottish in flavor, combining the expected Gaelic melodies (jigs, reels, and such like), with more modern, atmospheric, incidental scoring. Sprightly where it needs to be and brooding where it doesn't, it perfectly enhances the movie to the point that it feels as organic as the moss on the trees. The gentle lullaby, \\"A Mhaighdean Bhan Uasal\\", sung by Emma Thompson, is one of the stand-out pieces, and serves as the kind of musical representation of the love between Merida and Elinor. I also quite enjoyed \\"Song of Mor'du\\", a sort of Scotch drinking song, heard mainly in the background, but reiterated often throughout the rest of the score. There are also three other songs: \\"Touch The Sky\\" and \\"Into The Open Air\\", performed by Scots songstress Julie Fowlis, and \\"Learn Me Right\\", sung by Birdy, with Mumford and Sons, which, while not written by Doyle, fit expertly into their places in the story and aptly enhance the film.<br /><br />Now, a good animated character needs a good voice to bring them to life, and the entire cast is all very well-chosen and very well-acted. Comprised mainly of Scottish and English actors, including Billy Connolly as King Fergus, Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor, Robbie Coltrane as Lord Dingwall, Julie Walters as the Witch, and the incomparable Kelly Macdonald as Merida herself, it would be hard to find another group of people so perfect in their roles. Macdonald is wonderful as the flame-haired heroine, and Thompson simply shines as the equally obstinate but caring mother. Billy Connolly is a great counterpoint to her more level-headed and dutiful Queen, but gets far less screen time than either of the two female protagonists.<br /><br />To sum it all up, \\"Brave\\" is a beautiful, touching, exciting, and refreshingly original film, one that is entertaining on so many levels and can stand proudly alongside any of Pixar's previous masterpieces. I would rank it as one of my favorite (if not my favorite) Pixar film, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

0307592731|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend whose taste is similar to mine so I expected to like it. It came through loud and clear. Throughout I wondered if I could ever do what she did. I have been doing yoga almost every day for 2.5 years and have experienced a very cathartic self-healing process and can imagine that experience would be even more daring. I kept thinking how my life's \\"struggles\\" are in the self-actualization camp; and Cheryl's description of being in the \\"survival mode\\" created more self-actualization than anything ever imagined. This is such a good read for those on inner journey's. I highly recommend
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Both my 15 year old daughter and I LOVED this book and we can't wait for the next one!  I thought it was clever how historical facts were incorporated into the storyline and I thought the characters were pretty well formed. Even as long as it was, I could not put the book down.  It was an easy read that pulled you along -- think the Harry Potter books.  And neither my daughter nor I have ever had the desire to read the Twilight books, so I don't know how this book compares to those.  A Discovery of Witches is a fun book, perfect for a little escapist reading!

0345803485|3.0|This book (and all three in the trilogy) is in desperate need of an editor.  The same words and phrases are so overused that it distracts from the plot (which, in this book, is a bit lacking).<br /><br />I actually enjoyed reading the book, but not for its literary quality.  The steamy parts were absolutely overdone, and I was sick of it by the end of the book.  I was glad that this was toned down by the time the 3rd book came around.
B003M5AXN4|2.0|Really, why bother to make a movie in the odd manner in which someone had the harebrained concept as to make this one? This movie had to have been produced almost entirely in front of a blue screen. There is practically nothing real. It is almost as if the joke is on the viewer who possibly expected to see an actual movie. It is that bad. An as for Susan Sarandon, John Goodman, and Christina Ricci, you can almost see the look on their faces that A. No one they know ever sees this dog, and B. The paycheck doesn't bounce. Frankly, if you like the old Speed Racer cartoon, then watch it, not this. The only reason I gave two stars is for the learning experience. I learned just how badly botched even a simple old cartoon like Speed Racer could turn out modernized in film length. Blech.
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|I loved it!  I thought it was going to be a `chick' book, but boy was I surprised! Fast paced, I couldn't put it down.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome mix of cool games to download! good for young kids and adults alike. easy for kids to use even without directions.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is HOT! Great book, have the last one yet to read. Can't wait to get started on it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good but constantly trying to get your money from you. don't get if you have a microtransaction problem and spend all your money.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I'm enjoying this game very much... I love hidden object games and this one is excellent! I would love to play more games like this.
B005FFW46S|4.0|I own the rest of the series in paper format, but bought this one in ebook format.  As another reviewer noted, my paper versions fall apart from re-reading.  As a book, it was a great return to the city watch and Sam Vimes in particular.  Loved that, but the kindle version, sort of makes it impossible to read those footnotes at the appropriate spots without a lot of jumping around screens, which is possible to do on the touch, --  I totally missed reading them when switching to the ipad kindle reader.  but I will stick to paper for this series and for [[ASIN:B000NY11NS The Spellman Files]] and all the Spellman files books from Lisa Lutz where a lot of the humor is in those side-splitting footnotes.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Transformers is a movie that was meant to be seen in 3d! It was awesome!!! Highly recommend this over the 2d version! Well worth the additional money!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This Is a Great Game but I know how to get temple run BRAVE go to 4shared.com and then search temple run brave after that click on the one that says temple run brave v1.0 apk and it has a android symbol next to it both of these games are good but temple run BRAVE was just a little better for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is a great read! E.L. James sets up the characters well to make you feel like  you know them. The love story throughout the series keeps you interested. I didnt want the series to end!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game for being free tons of fun all in one down load good for kids and adults . so if you want to have fun and for free download this.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best in its class of \\"Lady Porn\\"!  It's a perfect combination of sex and romance for women.  This is a great read for the summer and also to turn up the heat in your sex life.  Yes, there is some S&M but keep in mind it's consensual  and this is fiction!  I highly recommend  the trilogy. Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Mobility Ware has done an excellent job with their solitaire app... Fun and challenging to Play... A limited, (very few) minor glitches when it wants to go to the advertising mode but it's minor problem not bothersome... Easy enough to get back to playing the game!  :) Two Thumbs Up!
B004132HZS|5.0|I love this show.  I hope many more episodes are produced.  The new Holmes and Watson are great, modern-day counterparts to the originals.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I play it like once a weeek. I likebit but it can get boring it has some fun games Wich is good. I would recommend for kids. HAVE FUN!!!
0547258305|4.0|I can see why Graceling is so well-loved by so many people. The writing is fantastic, and the world-building exquisite. I love the idea of this fantasy world where certain people have what essentially amounts to mutant powers. The notion of the different-colored eyes marking the Graced is great, as is the exploration of how the inhabitants of the different kingdoms view the Graced. In one kingdom, the Graced are honored, where in another, they are shamed. It's a very subtle look at prejudices and stereotypes woven throughout the plot, and how those perceptions impact an individual's self-image, and I thought it was very well done.<br /><br />The plot was also lovely. I enjoyed the action, and although I've read several reviews that thought the pacing was slow and the length ponderous, I thought it moved rather quickly. Maybe that's because most of the fantasy I read is adult. This book was certainly longer than a lot of YA fare, but I thought the length was justified by the story.<br /><br />Po was a fantastic character. I liked him immediately. I loved that he was nuanced and flawed, and I was surprised along with Katsa when new facts were revealed about him. There are certain parts of the book where Po is not present, and while they are extremely exciting and tense, I was still slightly distracted wishing Po was there. It's always fun when a book makes me actually miss a character when he's not around.<br /><br />I also loved the character of Princess Bitterblue, who is the focal point of one of the companion novels. While she was a child, I admired her attitude and spunk, and I enjoyed reading about her.<br /><br />I did have a few issues with the book, and these were just matters of preference, not of the storytelling or the writing. I was not a huge fan of Katsa. I understood why she was the way she was, and I definitely acknowledge that she is a far cry from many of the helpless damsels in distress that are abundant in YA literature. However, her extremely guarded and untrusting nature didn't make her a character I really enjoyed reading about. Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the story that she was involved in, I just didn't really enjoy her. And although she does exhibit some growth during the course of the book, it wasn't enough to make me really like her by the end.<br /><br />I also was a bit let down by the climax of the book (which actually occurs several chapters before the ending). It seemed kind of lacking after so much build-up. Now, I'm not entirely sure how it could have been done better or differently; I just know that after I finished reading it, my thought was, \\"Oh, that was it?\\"<br /><br />However, as an overall story, Graceling excelled. And considering neither of the companion novels focus on Katsa, I'm extremely interested in reading more about this beautiful fantasy world and the amazing characters that populate it.rded and untrusting nature didn't make her a character I really enjoyed reading about.

B004T2QZL8|4.0|I like the game and its pretty intertwining. The thing I don't like is that it stops you from playing intill you buy the full version. That should be changed and you should be able to make the choice on when you buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a fun and great game.but i would like to know if anybody knows how to see the images that u can buy with the coins you collect while playing the game because i bought one but its not showing up in my gallery.i am using a kidle fire.
0142410705|4.0|There are two kinds of people in the world, dumpers and dumpees. Collin has been dumped by nineteen girls named Katherine and he's decided to find a way to keep it from happening ever again.  After his break-up with the final Katherine Collin and his best friend go on a road trip to get away from it all while Collin decides to create the one thing he thinks will help him matter to the world: a formula that predicts the outcome of a relationship.<br /><br />I'm glad this wasn't my first experience with John Green's writing because I came away from this book feeling disappointed.  While Collin stands out as a unique character it's hard to empathize with him and his struggles.  I tried to like him but couldn't.  The introduction of Lindsey Lee Wells helped to keep my interest, as she is a character I could feel for and take a real interest in, but overall the book fell flat for me.<br /><br />Green's writing is still excellent and the town of Gutshot comes across as real and vibrant.  The side characters Collin meets there seem to have more personality than he does, and the stories they tell are realistically portrayed.  The idea of mixing mathematical equations within the book is another interesting idea that is integrated very well with the rest of the story.  I enjoyed watching the formula take shape and the premise of creating a \\"relationship theorem\\" was refreshingly original.  Green also adds another layer to the book with his footnotes, and you should take the time to read them along with the regular text because without them you'll miss out on some elements of the story.<br /><br />The book is written excellently and I wanted to love it as much as I've enjoyed Green's other books, but something about Collin kept me from being able to connect.  That being said, with its original take on dealing with relationships and break-ups it's a book I'll still recommend to my students and one every YA fan should give a chance.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|me and my family play it 4 hours @ a time its so fun and addicting! needs updated, but still, a fabulous game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has a lot of differentchoices for games. helps pass by time quickly. some games have slow responses but overall a lot of fun
B006470HZ6|5.0|You can tell that this series has some fantastic writers and plenty of creative freedom. Love it. All the best shows are on cable: Homeland, Breaking Bad, True Blood, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Girls, Dexter, etc.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I have to say, is DO NOT stop at the first book! Read the entire trilogy....the first book merely sets the scene for the real story....and it's a nail biter!!
B0086700CM|5.0|don't listen to them, It does not pay you for writing good reviews! idk about the fake reviews but this IS REAL. this is one of my taborite games, I love it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app combined several apps that I used and now all of my info can easily be accessed across the board.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I'm so happy I can finally have my very favorite app on my kindle!!!!!!!!!! thank youuuuu. this was the very first app I looked for when I opened my kindle and was segregated that I couldn't get it on here.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I love this app even more than the weather channel app. I love having the earthquake reports and weather advisories and the interface is fine. I also like the geomagnetic storm report. Great app.
0439023513|5.0|The book was a gift for my granddaughter and she has read the first two. I would think that she would enjoy it very much. The only thing she didn't get was the message that was supposed to go with it. Thank you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've recently become a very big fan of his books. I really enjoyed this one. I finished pretty quickly because it was too good to put down. I've heard that a movie is being made based on this book. I can't wait to see it :)
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great app and you should get it because it is free plus if u like getting achievements there is plenty in temple run;Also it has evil demon monkeys that try to get u then there is also different chareters to unlock like football players and explores or a city cop so over all it is a great app
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|There are only a few really good \\"old fashioned\\" ghost story movies and this is the best one that's come out in a long time. Others on my list are: \\"A Ghost Story\\" (with Fred Astaire), \\"The Changling\\" (with George C. Scott), \\"The Lady in White\\", and of course, \\"The Others\\". If you like really good old-fashioned ghost stories (that aren't about blood, guts, and torture), this one is for you. I wish they would make more like this!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of these games are pretty stupid! its not really all that great of an app. well at least I don't think it is. but its not the worst app either.
B001NXDSLQ|3.0|it was as good a time capsule of an era as there ever was made, but i just could not handle the switching back and forth between academy standard and widescreen aspect ratios, it was a major distraction for me. what made it worse was that the 1:33 main parts occupied only an ittybitty part of the screen in the middle, why couldn't the DVD's producers have made the 1:33 parts fill more of the screen? a 1.75x magnification would've done the trick without lopping anything off anywhere! a muted paisley virtual \\"pleated theatre drapery\\" border display would've at least made it seem more like the curtains placed around movie screens in a theatre which would've been a vast improvement over the huge black bars.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very glad I got into this.  This story is amazing.  Everyone should read this book!  Everyone!  You'll be glad you did!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I needed the third installment to complete my Toy Story set. I laughed; I cried; What a beautiful movie! Thank-you, Pixar! You have another winner!!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I see what he's doing here.  I just wrapped up this book.  It's not the fastest in the series, but it's pretty necessary for the story.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, full of action, intrigue and keeps you guessing until the end.  It was much like the first one, with a little more edge to it.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book was great.  The story was very fast paced and easy to read.  It makes some interesting statements on the future of the world while maintaining a playful adventure inside.<br /><br />The writing was amazing by any means, but the storytelling entirely makes up for what the writing lacks.
B005XBA9Y8|5.0|This Mercury box set has much more interesting selections of the repertoire than the Decca and DG box sets IMHO.  Don't fret over the missing original liner notes.  Heck, I never read them anyway.  It's missing the Howard Hansen Nordic and Romantic Symphonies Cd and the Chabrier Cd unfortunately.  Still, an incredible bargain for fantastic sound, cool cover art and record history.<br /><br />Updated 7/7/12<br /><br />After reviewing the content of the Decca Box set, I have to revise my review and assert that the content of the Decca set is really a lot better and more interesting.  I got carried away in this review with all the American content included, especially with Independence Day.  Both are great deals.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is my favorite book in the ASOIAF Series.  This one really has the pacing on point.  I cannot believe everything that is crammed into this book and I am looking forward to the day that I read again!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I was trying to install different things that might work with epub format and highlight/add memos. Couldn't get this to pull up the epubs on my tablet, but for books you can buy from their store it works fine.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|What an incredible follow-up to the smash hit Game of Thrones.  I was addicted.  The story was great and you end up falling so much more in love with characters you already knew, but hadn't given enough thought to.
B00005N6KG|2.0|They had really nice sound quality and stayed put when running, but they broke after a couple of months unfortunately.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Wow, I have to say that Adam Lambert's 2nd album is well worth the wait.  Again a great mixture of ballad and up-tempo songs.  'Underneath' is quite beautiful and sends shivers down the spine. 'Trespassing' is a great opener that you can dance, workout to.  There really is a varied range of songs that Adam sings brilliantly.  Even if you aren't an Lambert fan this is well put together, story telling, uplifting, mega-fantastic, splendid album.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|So glad I got this before HBO edits the bush scene out lol but it really is an amazing sure,anyone who is a fan of great story telling and not afraid of a few gruesome scenes then you will enjoy this show.
B003YZU53A|5.0|This movie should be watched by every human being in the world and for everyone to get the message. \\"Whatever my name is, I'm not a terroris\\"........!
B0039NK208|5.0|this is an up-to-date version of american graffiti.  you will bust a gut with the first three movies in this group, and, then check out american reunion, cuz this is by far the best one they made yet.  i saw the first movie with my teenaged son, and, quite frankly, never had a more hilarious time.  kind of gives you an inside peek at life of a current-day teenager.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Been wanting to catch the first season that I missed. Then I found out about the \\"controversy\\" of this edition of the series.  I just had to get it.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I absolutely love this album!! I of course have my favorite songs (\\"Love, Love, Love\\", \\"Slow and Steady\\", \\"Your Bones\\", & \\"Yellow Light\\"), but every song on this album offers something special and unique.  I can hear such a wide range of artist inspiration which makes for a really interesting album.  Get it.  You will not regret it.
0345803485|5.0|loved it
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I wanted to wait to write this review until i had a chance to listen a number of times. I find that the music i enjoy the most is when i find myself wanting to listen repeatedly. That's why god made the radio fits the criteria for this. I will admit that my first few listens, i really liked this disc, but i know feel this may be very well right there with just about anything they've done, and to boot this is a group effort not a studio album merely produced by Brian, but adding nothing but Beach Boy vocals. I will say that i at first felt that there was a lot here to compare to recent Brian Wilson solo, but as i listened i came to conclusion that this a Beach Boys album, and there has been nothing to compare to this since \\"Sunflower\\". Very Highly Recommended!
B007SGM084|5.0|Naturally everyone wants to identify this book as 'porn' but it is far more than that. Once immersed in this trilogy you'll find yourself identifying with the characters and routing for Anna and Christian to get together. Every woman I know who has read this book has wished on some level that their husband, boyfriend, or future Mr. Right was Christian Grey. In order for people to fully invest in reading a trilogy you need this character attachment, and E.L. James does this perfectly. This is Twilight for adults. I immediately saw the parallels when reading the first installment. This theme continues throughout, so if you were a fan of the Twilight series, and an adult, I highly recommend reading the Fifty Shades trilogy.
0743497465|3.0|When a meteorite is discovered in the Arctic Circle, intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton is called in to verify NASA's claim that the rock contains proof of extra terrestrial life. Of course, the release of information, either true or false, causes some to be uneasy, leading to an enticing conspiracy thriller featuring some of Brown's best writing. Despite this, I felt the story wasn't anything earth shattering. This provides an entertaining read but little more.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The story line is typical- bad boy falls in love with the unattainable girl, but the twists are original an entertaining. I found myself not wanting this book to end. The character development and descriptions are wonderful. My only critique would be that the ending felt a little rushed.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Poorly written.  Yes the book was very \\"steamy\\" but it was not well written. It played to every young woman's fantasy; a wealthy, young, handsome man who adores you, comes into your life, provides real excitement and rescues you from a hum drum normal life!  I thought if I heard her say one more time, \\"He looked down through his thick lashes\\" or \\"I loved seeing his beautiful feet\\" one more time I would throw the book across the room!  Come on, let's get some originality here! The sex passages became redundent I actually skipped many of them because they were so much the same!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I would have happily paid full price for this game, so getting it for free is AWESOME! For anyone who likes hidden object games, you should DEFINATELY add this one to your library.
0345803485|1.0|This book is horrible for all the reasons the other 1 star reviews have said. My issue is, have we lowered our literary standards so low that a poorly written, atrocious novel like this is the #1 best seller on Amazon? There is no hope.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|it's hard for me to see things on this little screen. i hope it gets better as i go along. i will come back and amend my 3 stars
B004XGN8W4|2.0|Well when the screen would stay on. The viewing angle was horrible. You had to find a sweet spot in order to get a good picture to look at. Move a Hair to the right, left, Up or down view was horrible.<br /><br />Stereo Speakers was excellent quality.<br /><br />Mine had an issue it would turn off by itself. Tried 2 Xbox 360 and one PS3 with all the same issue. Even tried another HDMI cord.<br /><br />I will give this another look when the monitor is upgraded to something of better quality.<br /><br />Sending Back to amazon for Refund.<br /><br />Im 38 years old and need to save my eyes. Hope you guys are gonna upgrade the monitor..<br /><br />I waited for the $209 price before I took the plunge. I wont get a better deal on this probably.....
B002ZG993Q|4.0|As I mentioned in a review of \\"Michael Clayton\\", I don't always like everything George Clooney is in.  This is another exception.  I also don't give you the plot in my reviews because plenty of others do that in theirs and it is redundant.  I will way that I felt such angst and empathy of this character.  It is a wonderfully developed character and I didn't see the end coming.  Really a good movie and I would recommend it.  Enjoy!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best!! dont listen to the dumbasses putting 1star rating. I'he been waiting for a long time to get it on KindleFire and now I cant stop playing it :P I completely recommend this game for everyone :3 btw my highscore is 754,580 :p Haha, just wanted to say
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I had heard nothing about this movie when I saw it, and about half way through I felt like it was going to be better than I thought.  I was right.  It is lovely, and well acted and I was moved to tears.  Along the way the characters are allowed to develop in what seemed realistic ways.  While there certainly are comedic moments, this is basically a romance and a fine telling of it.  So happy to recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm hoping to use this app often since there is so much content. I'm wanting to check out the other translations this app offers. I find it easy to navigate and am looking forward to having major Bible study using this app.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great game to play when waiting for appt or traveling.  Can stop and restart as time permits without loosing your place.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. If I had a few minutes I was reading this book.The book opens your eyes and your curiosity.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this ap does everything I need for it to do. it is easy to use and intuitive for non math types.  I recommend using this ap on Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very extremely addicting. the only thing I don't like is when I try to play while laying down it doesn't&quot;t work well
030758836X|5.0|An incredible gathering of wit, intrigue and seriously good writing will keep you enthralled with this novel. Flynn outdoes herself with such lifelike characters, I half expected to find Nick Dunne on my doorstep, or worse, his wife, Amy. You won't guess the plot turns or see the ending coming, even the subplot is worth five stars! Just a great, great read!
1451683405|5.0|I came across this book from the Huffington post[...] I've never heard of this guy before nor ever have I been curious of something any news outlet covered. However, I'm studying both psychology and neuroscience, and I too do some speculation of things, free will and reality just to name a couple.<br /><br />Upon reading this book, I was dismissive of his claim first,\\"free will is an illusion\\", and while it is true is also false. As another reviewer said \\"Harris states there is no free will, that it is an illusion, but offers no proof for his assertion. In fact, on Pages 13, 38, 39, and 40, he states that the sources of our intentions, desires, actions, and wants are unknown, a mystery, inscrutable or obscure.\\" If you don't know where they came from, how do you have freedom to choose them? This is one of the points Harris makes.<br /><br />While I now agree with Harris(to an extent), I think he needs to further develop his idea. The essay just goes to shake the delusion of free will we have, but does not really go too deep to break it(for many). It's an easy read, which might be why he didn't go deeper. He pussyfoots around it, but the illusion is we have less free will than we believe we do. Maybe a later edition or even a follow up essay could build upon this.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend it to a friend, any person can pick it up,read and understand it. Probably not good for kids under 12, but surely a teen could read it quite well and understand. Minimal knowledge of the subject is needed to read also.
B0060AY85C|5.0|Classic Toni Morrison novel. Riveting story, beautifully told. And the ending does not disappoint. Everyone I have recommended this book to felt richer for the experience.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins has done it again. The second book has even more twists and turns than the first one did. You won't be able to even put the book down until you know what happens next. This book has even more heart beating action then the last one. You will be so nervous you will find yourself squeezing your hands so hard. It has even more jaw dropping events. I love this book~\\"And May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor Once Again\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this as my number one Bible app on all my electronic. devices, iPhone, Droid, PC, and Kindle Fire. Enjoy!
0439023521|5.0|After i had read the first few pages i was hooked.Suzanne Collins has made an awesome Trilogy:The Hunger Games! This is my favorite book of all time. I am in love. I love the Edge, the Adventure,the Spirit,the Excitement,the Entertainment. This book is so good words cannot describe it. If you haven't read it yet I hope you like it,  \\"And May The Odds Be Ever In You Favor!\\"
0345803507|5.0|I read all three books in a weeks time....... I live these books and plan to read them again !!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is crazily adicting and it will hag u playing it all day.All I can say is that it is GREAT!!!!
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Nobody can go wrong with a Neil Young CD, whether with Crosby, Stills & Nash, solo, or with Crazy Horse but I'm finding I'm liking him even more with time. This CD caught my attention b/c of its concept but I've found myself singing Oh Suzannah more than once! Neil takes what we think we know, turns it on its head and says whadd'ya think of that? LoL, this is a must-have CD imho ~ get it! ;)
030758836X|3.0|While reading this book, I kept thinking that it was the best book I've read in awhile. The author writes beautifully. She has created a fantastic story that is a real page turner. And then you get to the end. For fans of the Sopranos, I'm sure you remember how you felt after the series finale. Well that's how I feel about the ending of this book. Such a great story, only to have such a boring, non-thought-provoking, open-ended ending. You have no idea what happens. You're left hanging. Prior to finishing this book, I was certain I would read more from this author, but I no longer am interested in reading a book with a great beginning, great middle, and NO end.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is a great Urban Fantasy Read. The characters and descriptions flow from present time to past. Rebecca Hamilton's writing is clean and smooth. The twists are brilliant. The characters are strong, full of surprises, and well thought out.<br /><br />Sophia's life was complicated enough before she went to that party with her friend Ivory. Now it's a complete mess. Not only does she have to deal with the whispers floating through her head, she has to deal with her not so stable mother, her mothers unforgiving church, and now she has a huge secret she must keep.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Forever Girl for Urban Fantasy Lovers!
0307951529|3.0|\\"The $100 Startup\\" by Chris Guillebeau is a good title for anyone tired of the corporate grind and looking for ideas and inspiration on pursuing a new career. Among the topics covered include:<br /><br />1.  Analyzing your skills, passion, and what people are willing to pay you to do.<br />2.  Instead of getting customers to act in your own self-interest, act in their self-interest and you will be on your way to success.<br />3.  Working your new career while traveling around the world.<br />4.  Demographics of the new entrepreneurs.<br />5.  Developing a simple business plan.<br />6.  Promoting yourself and your business.<br />7.  Suggestions for starting your business.<br /><br />The book is readable, is around 270 pages, and may be completed in a few sittings.  While an entertaining and informative read, I agree with earlier reviewers that the content could have contained more meat on the examples the author includes in his book.  For example, how about more detail on the struggles and challenges they faced when starting their new business?  How did they develop their clientele?  What were their secrets of success?  Etc?<br /><br />While these and other questions were somewhat addressed, I believe the author could have done a better job by going into much more detail.<br /><br />Although the book could have included much more detail, the author does a good job of providing inspiration for those looking for a new direction in their career.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It has so much in it.  I has great direction, people love it, i love it.  a great book & great trilogy. read it a couple times already and have enjoyed it both times.
061891868X|5.0|This is really what the book ultimately is all about. It is a physicist who has invested his life into tackling the big problems out there, which is what I'm sure every freshman physics major plans on doing with his PhD in 8 years or so. Smolin comes down hard on String Theory, but rightly so it's become an overly fashionable and sensational topic that is dominating science currently. I agree with the authors' point that the physics departments out there at the University need to be more open minded with what they allow to have studied.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly because I felt it was one of the best books on science that I have read. You may not agree with Smolin, I had a few disagreements with some of his topics but over all I can see the point he is making needs to be taken more seriously so science can be done properly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed, so much.  I find that its compared to the twilight series, but it has its own run. It was a great book & series. I have already read it twice. Just nice to see love that is not shown any more.
0375836675|3.0|This book is really good!!! If it was by any other author, I would give it five stars. But it's not. It's by Marcus Zusak, and, for him, my standards are high. I was expecting something incredible. Something life changing. In short, something like The Book Theif, a book with an incredibly poignant tale that has followed me around since the day I first read it, on my ninth birthday. I've read it countless times since then. But this? It's a good book, it truly is. But that's just it. It's good. Not scarily brilliant. Not a work of genius. It's good. It's thrilling, it's funny, it has strange twists and keeps you guessing. It gives you optimism about humanity, makes you happy, and has beautiful moments, however, it is annoying to read this when you know it could be so much more.<br /><br />In summary, it's good but not brilliant. I think its rather half-hearted.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down. I recommend it anyone who asks about it. All the girls at work are passing the series around.
0312370849|3.0|The book was an easy read but not a must read. I expected more but still enjoyed it. Sarah's Key is less about WWII & more about the journalist's present day life.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Scorsese does a masterful job in documenting the life & times of George Harrison .., an 'everyman' who had the admiration and repsect of all who knew him. It could not have been easy being stifled as the '3rd bannana' in the incredibly talented Beatles... but he never lost sight of who he was, and he maintained his class & dignity throughout \\"Beatle-Mania\\" and his entire life !<br /><br />If you liked the \\" Beatles Anthology\\" DVD set, and are a fan of Harrison and the Beatles, you cannot skip this set. You will NOT be disappointed.

0307716511|1.0|This was a great book with exception to the ending which I HATED.  I kept looking for a missing last page. Will not pass this one on.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I got this controller in December and it still works well. It felt a lot more lightweight than the dualshock 3 controller, but it was just as durable, if not a close second. My only complaint was that the analog sticks and the d-pad were kind of...not so great. The d-pad  would often times mistake the direction you pressed for a different direction, and the analog sticks kind of...melted. The R1 and L1 buttons started sticking after a while as well. Overall, it was a good controller, but i might consider getting a dualshock 3 next time.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Looks great on my Kindle Fire.  I do like being able to choose to play in a relaxed mode. Great graphics.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Simple but entertaining. This game has plenty of courses, cool power-ups and a good mix of easy and tough achievements.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I downloaded this app thinking that my granddaughter might like to play it especially since there is a new Ice Age movie coming out that she wanted to see.  we have been playing it together and now I am playing to add up points so she can buy new animals....
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I absolutely enjoyed this film.  Viola Davis carries her main character with so much grace and dignity - it is magical to see her portray a housekeeper who is also a nanny.  Story is placed in the deep south, during 1960s when civil rights movement is taking its momentum.  But like every movement, it takes time for it to reach rural areas and small towns.<br /><br />Emma Stone plays Skeeter, a white girl from privileged family who is not looking for husband after her college graduation; she is looking to establish herself as a journalist and writer.  She is sensitive and caring person and she her physical appearance fits perfectly for her role.  Her curly hair expresses her inner rebellion of the world around her; her big eyes communicate a much deeper emotions which are hearbreaking once she starts meeting with maids who tell her their stories from their years of service to while affluent families in town.<br /><br />This is a fabulous movie for every generation and both genders.  It is a reminder of time passed and it is also a humble look at strength these ordinary women had in order to server families that often humiliated them and then go back to their husbands who often treated them no better.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a really great game! They need to stop all the truck break-downs and reduce the garbage amount so I doesn't pile up.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|It's the best 3rd-party keyboard application but they still don't support Japanese even with all these other options and there are many bugs that go unfixed and they instead add things like themes instead of fixing the issues with functionality. For example there is a bug where it sometimes deletes everything you typed if you hit backspace; like it gets stuck. This hasn't been fixed after multiple updates but it's been listed on their site for a loooong time. Stop fiddling with the look until it works correctly.
B0080R7Q70|5.0|Banks of Eden, to this reviewer, is probably one of the better Flower Kings releases I have heard in about the past decade. Keeping in mind that this is the only release in the last five years. But, I think the time off has really done them a lot of good. They seemed to have stepped back from the machine like rhythm they got themselves into. You could expect a new release every year. Getting apart from one another, working on independent projects, and tours seems to have really refreshed them.<br /><br />All of the numbers are enthusiastically played and where the Flower Kings can seldom be accused of \\"going through the motions\\" there seems to be something that just sounds fresh and renewed about their performance. Dare I say that some of their recent work was getting boring?<br />One of the best things to come about during their recording hiatus is their new drummer Felix Lehrmann. Definitely the best drummer they have had since  Jaime Salazar and may be the best they have ever had. While not as heavy handed as someone like Mike Portnoy, he has a similar style where drumming becomes much more than just keeping a beat. He fills in holes and adds runs and rhythm changes; making a significant and exciting change to their rhythm section. The strongest compliment I can give a drummer is that you notice them! You hear them doing something special and you concentrate on listening just to them. Felix is this type of drummer. When you add this to Jonas Reingold's superior bass work you now have one of the most exciting rhythm sections in progressive music. Missing is Hasse Bruniusson on percussion, but dare I say with Felix he is not missed. (Sorry) Even though Roine Stolt's guitar playing has always been impressive, his many solos on Banks of Eden are fresh, sharp, and often stunning. I don't realy hear Tomas Bodin's keyboards taking much of a front seat this time around. He is there, but I can't recall him standing out in any particular song. Roine and Hasse Froberg freely exchange guitar solos throught BOE especially on \\"Numbers\\". I would say it does sound like a \\"guitar driven\\" album.<br /><br />With the stellar first song \\"Numbers\\" (at 25:20) taking up the first half of the CD the remaining numbers are quite a bit shorter. The remaining 4 are just 6 or 7 minutes long. The shorter numbers keep the second half of the cd moving right along and as most Flower Kings CD's, it ends before you really want it to. Even the songs on the bonus disk are quite good. While these tracks tend to become throwaway these could all actually stand on their own on another release. These 4 are all short as well with the longest just over 6 minutes. Speaking of the bonus disk, the interview, especially the vintage instrument and equipment tour is priceless, not to mention pretty humorous!<br /><br />All in all, you will really get nothing different from \\"Banks of Eden\\" than any other FK release. They really do not go out on any limbs and experiment with anything new. They stay with their tried and true formula and sound. What they may lack in originality on this CD they make up for it with enthusiasm! But for all who like just a good ol' FK cd this will fit the bill, will not disappoint, and remind us why we like them so much! I have to give it 5 stars in comparison to their last several releases and give kudos to Felix. While having absolutely nothing to do with the music, the artwork is stellar. Definitley some of the nicest artwork I have seen in some time!
B004LWZW24|3.0|Insidious (2010). Rated PG-13. Widescreen. Running Time 1 hour, 42 mins.<br /> Brought to you by James Wan (director) and James Whannell (writer) of the SAW film series (2004-10, 2017).<br /><br />  The Lambert family have moved into a two-story house. The house has nice wood inside. Like all horror movies, their is something creepy in this house. It starts with making noise in the attic. Renai (Rose Byrne) can't find anything wrong in the attic, but it is eerie like a presence is there. Dalton (Ty Simpkins) goes up in the attic to play. Up on a ladder, he tries to reach the string to the light. The  presence is closer to him, but we can not see it. Suddenly, his parents downstairs in the living room hear him scream. He had quite a fall with a wound on his forehead. They put him to bed. The camera pans to the window.<br />  The next morning, Josh (Patrick Wilson) tries to wake Dalton up. He is still. He is not responding. They take him to the hospital. The doctor (Ruben Pla) tells them he is in a coma.<br /> At home, Renai is listening to the baby monitor. Strange sounds are in the baby room. It becomes the voice of a man. Suddenly, it yells &#34;I want it&#34;. Renai jumps up and runs to the baby's bedroom. The baby is upset, but no one is in the room. Dalton is in his own bed still in the coma. Foster (Andrew Astor) hears the house making noise and he says someone walking in the hallway is bothering him. He wants to change rooms.<br /><br /> Twenty-six minutes into this movie, I was getting the creeps and it reminded me of [[ASIN:B003Q6D25K Paranormal Activity 2]] (2010). I wanted to turn it off and go to bed, but I can't. I'm scared. Have to continue watching this.<br /><br /> Renai can't stand it in the house anymore. She wants to movie to a new house. And so they do.<br /> The new house has more sunlight and appears to be cheerful. Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) is Josh's mother. She is there to help them move in and give comfort.  When Renai is alone, the creepy stuff happens again. Now she sees the haunted people again. Later, Lorraine admits to seeing the Indian guy in the corner of Dalton's room.<br />  They decide to bring in some paranormal help. Specs (Leigh Whannel) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) can find the ghosts. They also bring in Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) who has the most experience.<br /><br /> Option of subtitles: English and Spanish.<br /><br /> Special Features: Horror 101: The Exclusive Seminar (10 mins.)<br />  On Set with Insidious (8 mins.), Insidious entities.<br /><br /> Patrick Wilson and Ty Simpkins have work together before in [[ASIN:B003OPYOR8 Little Children]] (2006).<br /><br /> Barbara Hershey has dealt with ghosts before. She played &#34;Carla Moran&#34; in the movie, [[ASIN:B007XF0W9E The Entity [Blu-ray]]] (1982).<br /> It was nice to see her in this movie.<br /><br /> J.

B007I1Q4W2|5.0|This excellent movie is an intellectual examination of a scourge where there is little hope of recovery especially as set in a time of postwar despair.  The unhurried pacing and exemplary editing of the movie lends time for the zombie survivors to fully develop their characters to realistically portray that death is nothing when compared to the loss of all those things that make one human.  The score is brilliant.  Most impressive are the diary entries that narrate particular incidents, which are blended with animated drawings of the events without excessive detail or explanation.  I felt this movie really allowed me to imagine what was happening in each situation rather than having it forced upon me.  I thoroughly enjoyed this moving tale of the dead simply walking around rather than continually springing out at the characters for the cheap scares that usually plague the higher budgeted films of this genre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun and u can get new games so you can never get tired. of 101 +23 it rocks and l love it so much

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and this app works just fine for me. For all those people out there complaining about this app on thier Kindle obviously don't know what the hell they are doing. On the Kindle Fire you just have to set the app settings so the alarm doesn't start off at a low volume. So I highly recomend this app for the Kindle Fire.
B00845PV16|1.0|I loved the first one, like comic books and Nicolas Cage.  But this movie was so horrible if I didn't know better I would think it is a spoof.  Only reason to watch this movie is to laugh at just how horrible it is.

0765316994|3.0|The premise of Redshirts appears to have been developed from a drunken bitch session about the bad science, poor logic and gratuitous deaths in serial TV sci-fi like Star Trek and Stargate SG-1. (Yeah John you should TOTALLY write a book about that! It would be AWESOME!)<br /><br />While I enjoyed the story and humor, Scalizi apparently got bored with the premise and lost his mojo at the end(hence his coda about writer's block). Rather than bringing the story home in one or two final chapters, he simply said f-it, The End.  What happened to the foreshadowed grand final episode?  I anticipated a Q type being announcing that all the former Dub-U episodes were a dream/simulation/practice run, that no one was harmed and that all beings were living [insert syrupy utopian vision here].  John (or his editor) apparently decided that the finished book wasn't long enough so he appended a few disjointed, loosely connected chapters from the perspective of minor characters.  This dross has all the feel of deleted scenes from a movie.  They should have stayed in John's PC.

0345803485|2.0|I was skeptical about reading these books to begin with but after needing a new read, I decided to give in and see what the hype was about.  Now granted, I was not expecting Shakespeare here, but wow, this book is bad.  The main character, Ana, is a twit and is so naive, it's not even real.  Grey is  a chauvinistic power hungry idiot.  I found myself getting annoyed and bored.  Not even finishing it.  In fact, I'm even trying to GIVE it away to someone who wants it. Disappointed in myself for buying it and hoping that I may be able to return it. A real waste of money.
B000JIHP88|4.0|My 4 month old boy loves this. It really helps to settle him and will watch it for an hour!<br /><br />I wish it played for longer than 15 minutes but there is a remote to restart it from the doorway.<br /><br />One downside is that I had to oil it! It squeaked SO loudly when turning I had to turn it off. Still, it's fine since I oiled it :).
B005JABN8Y|5.0|READ THIS CAREFULLY.<br />The boat looks awesome after assembling. I would give 4.9999/ 5.0000 rating. The reason is: the boat has two sails and both are different in dimensions. I got two sails of the same dimension. I had to use a glue to stick it. But, that was okay and a minor mistake on their part which is no big deal but want to mention it here.

B00008PX8P|5.0|My husband actually had this video, and I loved it so much that I bought a copy for my dad who is also a Zeppelin fan. As this is original footage from the 60's the sound is not of highest quality, nor is the video; however, the performances are so enthralling that you loose sight of the technical shortcomings and just fall into the music. I've been listening to Led Zeppelin all my life but have never actually seen them in action. I loved the way they all worked off of eachother. You could tell that they loved playing together and could anticipate what the other was going to do next. True masters!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game. it is fast paced which I like and I am glad you don't have to make in app purchases
B0001CNRB6|5.0|Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies are my favorites. I wish they had made more movies together.  Tony Randall just adds an extra spark  to the movie when he plays opposite them  .  The movie is worth purchasing. You will want to see it more than once if you are a fan of these three talented actors.

0439023521|5.0|It was a welcome escape from reality. Fast paced and easy to finish in a day or two. I'll definitely get the other books in the series.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot find anything redeeming in this book.  It was poorly written and the characters are completely unrealistic.  I didn't expect it to be very good, but I read it because I kept hearing people talk about it.  I wish I'd saved my time and money.  I won't make the same mistake with the other two books.
0345803493|5.0|Great book to follow up the first. Read it on my anniversary trip on an island. I think my husband appreciated it.

B003JIPJRE|5.0|I was inclined to watch this movie because I actually HAVE the comic book that told the full story of what happened on that fateful day Todd was beaten to a pulp. It was very disturbing but also gripping and inspiring to me as someone who wanted to be a storywriter- what the animated movie doesn't include is Todd's mother, and if I remember right she was allied with the Joker and Todd tried to help her,<br /><br />Anyway, this was a great movie. Got me chuckling several times too- the Joker is the kind of villain I have a difficult time hating despite being a homicidal maniac! The animation is very well done- has a nice nostalgic 1992 TAS feel to it, which is a nice relief after seeing several experiments with different styles that is okay but not really as fantastic.<br /><br />Only one thing irks me- I can't help but think of Deadpool when I see the Red Hood. But I understand it's impossible to design a character that doesn't somehow remind us of another one :) I won't hold that against them though.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love this game! It has a very interesting concept. There are also many levels so it takes a while to complete.

0061692042|5.0|I have so much gratitude for this writer. People have commented here on the first sentences of the book. When I read the first paragraph of \\"Independence Day,\\" Ford's Pulitzer-winning masterpiece, I was literally propelled to my writing desk and pounded out a novel fueled by the inspiration of his opening words.  Further reading just enhanced my sense of inspiration and determination to write at MY best.  \\"Canada\\" does not disappoint.  I wept copious tears at the ending, having just lost my beloved husband of twenty-three years.  So much of Mr. Ford's works are about loss, and rising above one's own fears and weaker tendencies to live a good life of compassion and service.  Long may he live, long may he write.

B001SN78JO|5.0|\\"Yes Man\\" (2008) - Directed by Peyton Reed.  Rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor, language, and Jim Carrey's backside as seen in an ICU robe (which is why they call it \\"I see you.\\")  Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel. Bradley Cooper, Fionnula Flanagan, Terrence Stamp, Vivian Bang, Sasha Alexander, Rhys Darby, Danny Masterson, Brent Briscoe, and others.<br />A guy challenges himself to say \\"yes\\" to everything for an entire year.  Loosely based on Danny Wallace's autobiographical book (he makes a cameo appearance in the film).<br />Jim Carrey doesn't exactly hit a home run out of the ballpark every movie he makes, but this time he got it right.  This film is a feel good flick that makes an excellent compromise for when wives and girlfriends insist on their guy watching a \\"chick flick\\" with them.  Both sides of that equation can thoroughly enjoy  \\"Yes Man.\\"  Seriously, say yes, to \\"Yes Man.\\"<br />Shortly after the end credits begin, there is a short scene in which Carl (Jim Carrey) and Allison (Zooey Deschanel) ride down a mountain road on body skates (31-wheel roller suits, the genuine article invented by Jean Yves Blondeau).  Looks like fun, if ever there would be a place where somebody could actually take on that level of experience and not run into some serious mountain pass traffic.<br />A single DVD that includes wide-screen and full-screen versions; languages and subtitles in English, François, and Espa&ntilde;ola.
1466401885|5.0|I loved this book. I couldnt put it down. I love the story and the characters and how everything unwound in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone. It truely is a great book one that im sure i can read more than once and still not be able to put the book down.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its fun so far.I have had a few problems with it starting and stopping, but it is fun! I wish there were more letter spaces for your ice village's name,though.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|Thank God for the two leading ladies in this film for without them it is just another Nicole Conn lesbian disaster film.<br /><br />The chemistry between Necar and Traci seemed genuine and the kiss was simply beautiful (and quite exciting) to watch----- and coming from a lesbian who has continually been disappointed by the campy, low budget stuff that is out there in this genre, that says a lot.  I went back four times over the last day just to rewatch that incredible kiss.....3 minutes and 24 seconds of beauty and bonafide sensuality.<br /><br />The film itself however, with its annoying and ridiculous 'soulemetry' premise, was obviously written by someone who thinks her audience is daft at best. Weird cut off memory scenes and montages just added to the aggravating quality of this film. Again,  thank goodness for the actresses and their seemingly genuine chemistry because without them I would have given this film only one tiny little star.<br /><br />Perhaps someday Nicole Conn will make a genuine romantic lesbian film that doesn't look like it was shot between someone's backyard and the local park. Get it together Nicole and please work on the storyline and your editing please before making another film.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|The product works great. The only thing that takes getting good at is the actual breaking of the bottle into two pieces. It suggest to ways. One is to do hot and then cold water and the other is to break the glass with a metal rod. I found that the hot and cold water work best but it takes some getting use to. After that sand down the edges just a little and then you have just made some cheap drinking glasses when you've emptied your bottle.
1402786360|5.0|I am so happy I got this cookbook. I don't buy many, but this one deserves a spot on my shelf! There are basic recipes for all of the things you might consider using for decorative baking, and then there are loads of pictoral instructions on decorating options way more interesting than fondant + frosting.  Heather Baird's notes on each cake and cookie type help avoid many of the problems first time bakers encounter with these recipes and are bits of golden common sense you usually have to learn from Grandma.  I am so very pleased. :)
B004M3H17Q|5.0|The first time I heard him, I HATED his voice. Then I saw a video of him playing \\"The Wilhelm Scream\\" on youtube and it finally clicked. I was hooked. He is the definition of unique... He is carving for himself a new genre all of its own. Some of the reviewers on her are getting mad cause people are comparing him to Bon Iver and/or dubstep, but that's just because there is no one like him. There is no way to label him as anything, cause there is nothing to compare him to.<br />With that said, this record is perfect. I love that he gives you tiny glimpses of his influences, like the more electronic sounds of \\"Unluck,\\" to the the gospel influence in the closing track, \\"Measurements.\\" Buy it. Now.

B003G4W49C|5.0|While I highly enjoy science-fiction movies, I'm not overly fond of their written counterparts. However, this book amazed me. The story is about Ender, a genetically enhanced child genius, who lives in a futuristic world where earth is under constant fear of invasion from an insectoid race of intelligent alien beings known as the &#34;buggers.&#34; Ender is one of thousands of children with minds genetically enhanced from birth. Part of a desperate attempt to find a commander for the human space fleet, these children have devices implanted in their bodies from birth that allow certain people to see through the child's eyes. These people evaluate the children throughout their early years, and decide which would make suitable saviors of the human race. The chosen few are taken to Battle School, where they are trained for space combat and leadership. Although Ender and his two siblings are all genetically enhanced, only he is selected, which angers his older brother, Peter.<br />At Battle School, Ender faces rigorous training exercises in zero gravity, as well as mock battles in the Battle Room, a giant room with no gravity whatsoever. Ender becomes excellent at these battles, and finds himself commanding his own squad before long. Meanwhile, Ender's older brother, Peter, sweettalks his sister Valentine into helping him hatch a plot to try and win over a world on the brink of civil war. Overall, the book was another of Orson Scott Card's many literary masterpieces. I can't wait to read books 2&3!
B004QOB8SO|1.0|Again,Season two contains only three episodes and I must say not as good as the first season ( not that you get much time to decide)just not worth the price!
B00005Q66T|2.0|Taken as singles, each of these songs are great.  But on a compilation of Madonna from the 1990's, it just feels plain weird.  Madge's songs evolved and changed in the Nineties compared to her 1980's output.  She became more of an album's artist compared to a singles artist during the Eighties.  So taken as a context, meshing these songs together for a one-disc compilation feels WEIRD and AWKWARD.<br /><br />The songs from \\"Ray Of Light\\" just sound awkward mushed next to \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Music\\".  And \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" shouldn't even be on here, since it was a movie soundtrack from an awful movie.  Madonna's version shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as Patty Lupone's original version.  If they had to take a song from \\"Evita\\", they should've gone with \\"You Must Love Me\\", an original song written for the movie that won an Oscar for Andrew Lloyd Weber.  But no, they had to go with a lame choice like \\"Don't Cry For Me....\\".  If they wanted to include songs from her movie soundtracks, where is her song from the Bond movie \\"Die Another Day\\"?<br /><br />So taken as a whole, the listening experience on \\"GHV2\\" falls far short of the pleasure found on \\"Immaculate Collection\\", which feels much more fulfilling and complete, and also offers many more tracks.  Producers on \\"GHV2\\" got stingy for offering far less tracks.<br /><br />Also, on a somewhat sad note too, if you look at the songs on \\"GHV2\\", many did not hit the #1 spot for Madonna whereas almost all the songs on \\"Immaculate\\" went to the top of Billboard's charts.  So, Madonna's music did not have the impact in the Nineties as her Eighties output.<br /><br />Stick with \\"Immaculate Collection\\" and get Madonna's \\"Celebration\\" 2-disc set instead, which aligns all her major hits from the first 25 years of her career.  Skip this \\"GHV2\\" CD.  It's a  rip-off and just plain lame.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|I loved this movie! Now, I know I am being a bit partial because I did extra work on the movie, so I was there to see scenes that didn't make it in and scenes that did but before they were edited. So, for me finally seeing the final product was great. I saw the movie in theaters multiple times and took different people to see it. Everyone that saw it with me enjoyed it as well. It is a silly comedy, with some messages underneath. I think the movie speaks highly to not letting things get to you and taking the time to appreciate the small things. I loved all the actors in the movie, they were all very nice and down to earth as well on set. I think it has plenty of laughs and the only thing I haven't seen in the bizarro cut, which I am interested to see because I'm sure some of the things I didn't see make it in, are in that.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie and a good time. :)

B006RUJST6|5.0|I saw this book while searching for something good to read.  I almost didn't purchase it when I read some of the negative reviews.  I'm glad those reviews didn't keep me from buying it.  How anyone can read this book and give it a negative review, I just can't understand.  I'm a 51 year old man and I cried reading this book.  What a great story.  Colleen Hoover, I can not believe you were able to write such a spellbinding book as your first foray, but thank you for writing it.  I look forward to reading more or your works and as soon as I finish this review I will be purchasing your next book in series.  If you read my review and are wavering on whether to purchase this, I urge you to take a chance on it, I don't believe you will be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is a real page-turner; you will not want to put it down.  The narrator's 14-year-old son is accused of murder and his father, a prosecuting attorney, is helpless as his son stands trial.  You will not know until the very end what happened in the park.
B007SGM084|4.0|This is a great, fast, fantastical read if you can suspend all reality about courtship, sex, love, children, maturation and any of a number of laws similar to gravity that we depend on to live and survive.  And perhaps that's the charm of Fifty - that it's antithetical to everything any wise woman ever told you about falling in love and being a chaste woman - and yet its a love story to which all women can relate.  Clever, ridiculously sensual and mutually naive all at once.  Good read.
B006JD48NM|5.0|This great documentary by director Asif Kapadia is the ultimate tribute to driving legend Ayrton Senna. During nearly two hours of astonishing archival footage, Senna's entire life unfolds before our eyes. Commentaries are kept to a minimal and there're done by the actors themselves. A good example of this is seen in the aftermath of Senna's fatal crash at Imola. We see the paramedics hopelessly trying to save the champion's life while in the background we hear the voice of doctor Sid Watkins, the first person to examine Ayrton after his horrific impact on the wall. If Senna would still be alive today, he would certainly be a major actor in the political life of his native Brazil. Charismatic figures like him came once in a century and I was blessed to see him win three times the German Grand Prix. Long lives Ayrton!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't waste your money or your time! I read books like a chain smoker smokes cigarettes, so I've read a few. It was terrible, the only thing she really had going was the characters.<br />I found myself grow bored of sex scene after sex scene and skipped pages at a time just to get back to the story! And dont get me wrong I'm not a prude and do love me a good roll in the hay while pulling out the crops, but this... ugh!<br />I'm the world's worst person at grammer, well at least I thought I was until I read this. It's a shame she's sold all these books and still hasn't paid a editor yet to fix it. It's really not hard to upload a new file on KDP!<br />I guess some people are just all about the money and not the book they wrote.

B007STXHTM|4.0|I'm new to GOPRO cameras, but I'm not new to diving. Anyone who has looked for an affordable solution to underwater video recording has most likely realized that the options are VERY slim! Needless to say this was my attraction to the Hero 2. The only problem.... the BLUR!<br /><br />There are a multitude of products to fix the blur, but this is the first product offered by GOPRO, and I must say it is an amazing product. The case functions just like the original, with an identical latching mechanism. The difference in the flat front lens. It gives amazing quality and allow the camera to give sharp focus above or below the water. Note: The new lens cuts off about half of the LCD display, but you can still see most of it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that GOPRO hasn't released any clip on filters; however, I doubt it will be long before they do. You can take off the lens cover with a 6 point screwdriver and drop your own gel filters in there if you'd like, but I'm not sure if this will compromise the waterproofing.<br /><br />Pro-tip: Put a little Rain-X on the lens so you get a smooth underwater to above water transition.<br /><br />As Soon as they release some filters then I'll up it to 5 Stars

0393088774|1.0|There's nothing new in Paul Krugman's new book. It's the same old prescription to print, borrow, tax, and spend more and more with no plan to stop. Krugman pretends to know all the answers to our economic problems. He admits a depression but fails to point out that our administration officially called the recession at an end in 2009. In a prior book, 'The Return of Depression Economics'  he equivocated by saying that the world is not in a depression, but he's not quite sure. Now, after three years of the Obama administration, he's sure. Krugman, like the politicians he supports, would like to do more and more when it is apparent that it can accomplish less and less.<br /><br />Immediately after repudiating money as the proper vehicle of measurement Krugman cites the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s. His economic amateurism shows as he treats his readership like idiots. He thinks that we believe Hitler came to power as a result of the German inflation of 1923. The German inflation ran from 1920 to 1923 when Hjalmar Schacht instituted monetary reforms of the kind that Krugman deplores. The German economy then did quite well until overcome by the world wide depression that brought Hitler into power. He does point out that the inflation wiped out middle class savings, a terrifying reminder of what is happening in the USA today, albeit currently slower than was the result of similar Wiemar social policy.<br /><br />Krugman claims to follow Keynes' legacy, but his understanding of Keynes is suspect. Keynes would be horrified to see his ideas used to cover for permanent deficits in good times and bad. Keynes would be the first to point out that his multiplier does not include pork and entitlement spending, nor welfare items like unemployment extensions. Keynes applied a metaphor of magneto trouble to the British economy of 1929. Krugman is unoriginal enough to apply Keynes's metaphor to the current American problem. It is doubtful that Keynes would see it the sameway. Our defects are built into our political structure.  The engine is broken; it's not just the 'magneto.' Krugman decries the current animus against Keynes. Keynes' ideas are not the problem.  The fault is in politicians who are cheered on by misinterpretations of spending advocates. QE stimulus is so full of well meaning social spending as well as pork and corruption that few jobs are created, while cutting existing military placement will result in a net subtraction.<br /><br />The worst of Krugman's blatant errors is his insistence of the utility of printing money. He cites the simplistic model of a babysitting coop that got out of a coupon savings glut by printing coupons.  Overly fascinated with the successful baby sitting co-op described by Joan and Richard Sweeney, Krugman uses it as a simplistic model for the current U.S. economy. He neglects to observe that co-op members cannot invest their holdings and are not subject to government regulation, taxation, subsidies or stimulus. By the end of the book he has parlayed the babysitting metaphor into a recommendation for central planning while claiming that there really will be a free lunch from new ideas. It's frightening to see a liberal economist, of the type now firmly in control of government, thinking of money as coupons. The substance or source of these ideas remains undefined. A major premise is that rolling the printing press is a simple solution. As H.L. Mencken said, \\"For every complex problem there is a solution that is easy, simple and wrong.\\"<br /><br />In attempting to whitewash the burgeoning national debt relative to GDP he claims it's due to declining GDP. But GDP varies by a much small percentage than debt has been rising annually. He shows the debt/GDP ratio in a figure, but omits to show a related GDP curve. About four times in the book he illustrates his case with rising employment due to government spending in time of war. He appears to hope for a disaster as an opportunity for more government control of our personal and private resources. He fails to analyze the results of the guns and butter spending of the Viet Nam war era. The national debt, mostly hidden, is unsustainable for much longer. Krugman points out that debt can be a good thing, as for infrastructure, or housing or transportation. It's disingenuous to imply that's how our government debt has been used.<br /><br />He also makes the error of saying that the national debt is something that we owe among ourselves. That may have been true when Lincoln said it but now the Chinese, Japanese and British are now financing half of our deficits through an ever worsening balance of trade. The recent ruling by Tim Geithner granting direct Treasury access, heretofore reserved for US citizens, to China makes it a foolish remark for 2012.  It's one of the structural problems that Krugman fails to notice. It's highly disturbing to see an influential economist as a proponent of unlimited debt with no intention of payback. It amounts to government thievery, rather than welfare altruism or economic necessity.<br /><br />After an explanation of bank runs, Krugman takes a wrong turn as a movie critic.<br />George (Jimmy Stewart) in 'It's a Wonderful Life' averted a run in a flash back sponsored by his guardian angel, not as the author says an anachronism of a bank run after WWII.<br /><br />Krugman  justifies spending because the government can currently borrow at a low rate of interest.  What happens when interest rates rise? Where was he while all that spending was going on in times of higher interest rates? When interest rates rise due to either an improved economy, inflation mitigation, or government freezing out the private sector will liberals advise reduced spending?  As Jeanne Sahadi, CNNMoney.com, says, \\"Interest rates on U.S. bonds may be ridiculously low, but that doesn't mean the country's future interest payments on the national debt will be.\\" True, borrowing costs are currently low. Debt service now about 9% of GDP will go 40% as rates rise as they must after all the printing. In citing an excess supply of savings does Krugman mean foreigners? He says that he \\"doesn't want to minimize debt problems\\" then proceeds to do just that. He says the burden on future generations is smaller than stated by deficit hawks. Indeed devaluing money is a huge problem for current generation of savers and retirees. Our progeny will carry our debt, until default with cheaper money. Never mind that their salaries will be cheapened also. He proposes strange arithmetic in saying that it's ok if debt grows more slowly than the sum of inflation plus growth. It's not happening. Inflation, by government calculation is about 2.5% with growth about the same. The national debt has increased by 300% in three years. Krugman makes a good argument against himself<br /><br />It's ridiculous to say that the market is shouting that there is no worry about the deficit. What is Krugman looking at?  He denigrates the position of Pimco's Bill Gross, who voices concern over the creditworthiness of USA  bonds due to burgeoning debt. Gross cares about bondholders, Krugman does not. He says actual investors are unconcerned about the national debt. Is Gross not an actual investor? In fact he speaks for many. Krugman ignores our negative current account balance and excessive payroll tax burden on American labor. His anti- business bias shows as he cites borrowers like Lehman using repos. For your information Paul, GE and IBM also use repos. He says the GOP favors a return to the unsuccessful gold standard. A hog manure standard would be an improvement over the current unlimited fiat money based on debt.<br /><br />Krugman asks if consumption is down and government spending is down who buys our bonds or where is the money coming from? It's coming from Chinese and other foreign investors who are financing our debt. He ignores the detrimental effect of our permanently negative current account balance.He asks is our problem is structural. Yes it is. He overuses what he calls a 'Minsky moment.'  He should consider the potential tipping point when increased government debt passes the point when there is no more confidence in US bonds. As Margarete Thatcher said \\"The trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other peoples money.\\" Krugman doesn't say how much is enough or when to stop. He does say that this is not the right time to slow down spending so his answer seems to be never, never , never.<br /><br />Citing the anatomy of an inadequate response, Krugman points out that there is currently a world wide depression. He ignores China and Germany. He says the \\"obvious answer\\" is fiscal stimulus. Obviously not! Germany is doing quite well while Obama and Hillary continue to inveigle Merkel for more stimulus. Merkel recognizes that most of the stimulus benefit of American spending is going offshore. QE1 and QE2 spending is not enough. Increasing spending in 2007-2010 was, by admission, to help poor and near poor, not for economic stimulation. Krugman courageously references Rienhard and Rogoff 'This Time It's Different'. That book is a good refutation of Krugman's ideas. (7)<br /><br />Inequality is not the cause of our current economic mess and inflation is understated by our government. For a PhD, Krugman is remarkably naive if he ignores monetary dilution to believe the moderate current inflation figure around 3%. CPI and PPI figures, used to measured \\"Core\\" inflation, are manipulated by excluding volatile components each month. The flood of money that holds interest rates low can't fail to create price inflation in the future.<br />Krugman calls inflation a phantom menace. Tell that to a retiree who needs his savings to support  his retirement. He will be a government dependent before his 20 year retirement is finished. But that conforms with Obama and Krugman's vision of equality. Krugman ignores the many retirees attempting to live off of lifetime savings in an increasingly futile attempt to avoid dependence on government largess. A recent CNN article points to one third of the middle class dropping into poverty since implementation of the social programs of the 1960s. The trend is accelerating for the rest of us.  (9)<br /><br />Krugman says the large European trade deficit needs plausible path back to being competetive. What about the USA? Why is Krugman's advice so different for the USA than for Europe? He spends much space justifying why the picture doesn't show what it seems. Spending won't solve problems for Europe or the USA.<br /><br />Asking what it will take to get out of the current malaise, Krugman suggests \\"spend now pay later,\\" \\"vote for hope\\" and \\"Rooseveltian resolve,\\" all  wishful thinking. True, the economy is not improving by itself. It's also evident that QE1 and QE2 have not helped. Krugman is critical of Fed Chairman Bernanke even though the Fed has tripled the monetary base since 2008. (12)<br /><br />One accurate statement that Krugman makes is that the time for austerity is in boom times, not recession. Did he advocate cutting back on the LBJ guns and butter approach that killed the boom in the 1960s? Did he attempt to slow the Clinton spending of surpluses in the 1990s? It's certainly true that if that money was available today we could spend our way out of a weak economic cycle. No one thinks that spending cutbacks will invoke prosperity, but there needs to be a recognition that government stimulus is not working. It can only lead to disaster for our progeny down the road. It's fair to say that intervention worked in the '30s, but hasn't worked since. In his concluding chapter, entitled 'End this Depression,' Krugman cites austerity mania. What austerity mania? The only agreement in effect is a 1.5 trillion cut over ten years. With a current 15 trillion debt, it won't even slow down spending. Krugman never says how much is enough or when to stop. It's a sad situation when austerity (savings) becomes a dirty word. Economics, in the author's words, has become a morality play. (13)<br /><br />Mostly we see an economist trying to morph into a social scientist. In spite of denial, Krugman mixes economics with politics, comparing Romney to Gordon Gecko in the movie 'Wall Street' and saying that Obama is most likely to do the right thing. His economics is often based on aphorisms like \\"ketchup economists\\" and \\"schlock economics\\".  The book is devoid of new ideas or logic. For a better view of the liberal position read Joseph Stiglitz or Robert Eisner instead.

B007OAAK0O|5.0|It's taken 29 years for day one to resurface in it's entirety. I was there in Central Park on both days. When the rains came Ms Ross stepped up and earned the right to be called a Diva, a Superstar and any other allocades you may want to heap upon her. As Judy Garland once joked about never forgetting  how that brave Jennette (McDonald) stood there  in the ruins of an earthquake and sang. so too anyone there day one never will forget how that brave Diana just stood there in the downpour and sang , and sang. She went above and beyond the call of duty staying on stage trying to keep the crowds calm as they left the park. Some of the shots gotten on day one were breathtaking.<br /><br />When we arrived at home after day one we called the station and mentioned that if it in fact went on again on day two it would be a shame not to include some of day one's footage as part of the program (the final full length program was scheduled for repeat broadcasts).On day two we were pleased to see they had done so. Being there both days one didn't quite know what was going out over the broadcast either day. I'm ecstatic to finally see day one as it aired.<br /><br />A historic concert, a star turn , highly recommended.

0345803485|1.0|This is literally one of the worst books I've ever read, and I'm appalled that people seem so into it.<br /><br />1) It glorifies violence against women at a time when women are under siege in the workplace, in the arena of access to health services, and culturally - (how thin do you have to be to be beautiful, for instance). I grew up in the 1950's and 60's and we fought hard for equal rights. This book is pathetic.<br /><br />2) The book describes a very young naive woman, (who must have been living in a cave instead of at a University, since she doesn't even have an email address), who has been to high school and college, yet hasn't managed to locate her parts and pieces - (she's never had an orgasm before), who comes under the sway of a self-made BILLIONAIRE, aged 26, who wants to humiliate and hurt her for his own enjoyment.<br /><br />3) The writing is absolutely painful.<br /><br />4) The characters are completely disingenuous, shallow, as if whoever wrote this was 14 years old.<br /><br />5) The sex is totally vanilla.<br /><br />6) The writing is painful to read. I literally couldn't finish it.<br /><br />I do have a suggestion for Mrs. James... that she consider taking some college level writing classes. And I would truly love to have Gilbert Godfreid narrate the audio version. Seriously, that would be a hoot.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found Wool purely by accident, and soon found myself immersed in a true page-turner, a \\"read till the end\\"-novel. If you liked Metro 2033, or the game Fallout 3, this Omnibus is for you.<br /><br />It's well written, well told and done so in a believable manner. The only thing I take issue with is the basic premise: Wanting to leave the Silo is a deep taboo among the inhabitants, and it's actually forbidden to even mention it under the penalty of death. But for some reason watching the outside is not only accepted, but encouraged and actually so important that the \\"Cleaning\\" of the sensors is part of the system. I would imagine anyone would be to afraid to see the outside, for fear of invoking dreams of leaving.<br /><br />This however doesn't really affect the telling of the story, I loved it from about 10 pages in until the end. Now I'm off to read the prequel.

It keeps you interested in it and wanting more and more! I recommend buy it and reading them all! I have read over other reviews on this site and also thought to myself \\"eh another twilight\\" but after you get through the first few chapters it gets better! Read at least halfway through the first book before judging it or giving up on it. I almost did but my friends were like \\"keep reading it, it gets better\\" so I did. Now I love it! I am on book two and almost done. I have book three waiting!

B000L212HC|5.0|Are you watching closely?  Well you should be because this is a movie that will keep you guessing!  Christopher Nolan has done it again, now telling the story of rival magicians at the end of the 19th century.  The cast is outstanding and draw you in almost immediately.  The special features are common for a standard edition but still manage to give some great extra time exploring this world and idea.  I've heard it said that Christopher Nolan doesn't make bad movies and this definitely helps add to that.  Fans of Memento and other slightly-bent mystery will certainly love this.  It's a fun, intriguing film that is simply magical in every way.

B001992NUQ|5.0|Fight Club is one of those movies where if you explain the plot to anyone before they've seen it, it will ruin some of the surprise.  So do avoid summaries and definitely avoid spoilers.  This is a movie that will keep you interested and invested from start to finish.  Tyler Durden will make you question your life and wonder what it is you really want to achieve before you quickly decompose.  Many cult films are followed for different reasons; cheesy dialogue, goofy dance routines, but Fight Club is famous because of how eye-opening and different it is.  Do not go in expecting anything you've seen before.  This is not a boxing movie.  This is not a comedy.  This is not a straight-forward drama.  This is a cocktail of it all and you're in for one hell of a hangover.

B0000640SA|4.0|Memento is a film that is undeniably original.  The fun of the movie is plugging the pieces together and arranging the plat in your head so it adds up.  It is mind-bending and thought-provoking and will keep you asking questions until the shocking final reveal.  It is a movie that will require multiple viewings and each time you watch you will still enjoy it.<br />The special features on this strange edition are not as enticing as the appear.  The idea is genius but the menus are not as difficult as you might think.  It definitely adds a whole new level with features like Chronological Viewing and the inclusion of the original story.  If you need a new idea, a movie that can change your perception of the industry, this is the film for you.  There is nothing else like this out there and I doubt anything will ever dare try and copy.
0521707803|5.0|thank you for a book... it is good. However, i found out that its so hard for me : ) I will study it later.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have finished all the puzzles but I am stuck on one. Does anyone know what the final picture is for level 8 puzzle 22? Awesome game. Has kept me busy for weeks. Wish there were more games like this.
0740797719|5.0|I debated buying this book for months, because the cover just didn't do anything for me. But after reading so many positive reviews (and the negative ones were being nit-picky),I decided to give it a try. Wow. Mr. Gurney truly sees the light in every thing. He sees direct light, and indirect light, how it reflects and bounces, all the little nuances, and the big displays. AND he knows how to explain and teach what he sees, helping the artist (neophyte or pro) to understand where the light is and how to put it into your own paintings. I have read the book twice, page by page, learning and absorbing, and it will be a well used reference book from now on. I give it a resounding five stars!
B0088TG252|2.0|The movie is relatively tired and formulaic, you can spot the 'traitor bad guy' fairly early on and it's just a standard spy/action movie. It's preachy as all hell about how terrible the intelligence community is, and involves a file that's very damaging to Western intelligence agencies. Basically, the movie is a fantasy about how awesome it would be if the wikileaks documents had made any actual impact in the world.<br /><br />Could have been a lot more interesting, there was ample opportunity for a more mental/psychological aspect to the movie with Denzel Washington's character; instead the movie takes a hard left turn and never comes back.
B00785P2QC|5.0|if you like strategy this is for you. it is very realistic, you need transport trucks, busses, houses,  buisnesses and, you can even get an airport.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The story line is always written well, and the actors fit the part.<br />You won't be disappointed in buying the 3rd season, I've got all the seasons<br />and will continue till they stop running.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It is awesome just like on my computer. One of the better games I have found on here. Love it and won't be deleting this game anytime soon! If u like spider solitaire on ur personal computer u will like this game!
B000XR4OC0|1.0|My daughter asked for tom's for her 12th birthday. We are on a tight budget so this was a major purchase for us. We purchased a pair in april and one month later her toe had worn thru. She can't wear them anymore. We bought these in a store and the sales clerk measured her for a true fit.  She wasn't even allowed to wear them out to play so that we could keep them looking nice.  Well,  this is an inferior product and i would never buy them again. What a waste of money.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|You will love this game it is so fun.So I hope all of you gyes like it.this game has levels.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|well I love this game I love the moviem m m m mmmmm m m<br />m m m mm m m m m m m m m m m
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is great!  I am stationed overseas and this allows me to listen to my radio stations from back home since the radio station selection overseas is limited.  It also allows me to listen to this at home without having an external tuner and antenna.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I want this app soo bad for my kindle fire! AMAZING GAME!!!!!!! its addicting! id play it all day if I didn't have to keep charging my kindle all the time!
B000JNN0SM|4.0|This was a very good scifi thriller and it held my attention. I'm glad I own it to watch whenever I need a good tingling on  my spine.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Excellent book.  Well written with a very good story.  It's fairly well edited (my contributions therein below).<br />Characterization was excellent.  We really got to know the main characters and his cohorts.  There was a lack of clarity on the import of some minor characters, which seemed to be extremely important at some point, and then had little or no impact on the book as a whole.<br />I liked the dual-writing style used, i.e., the historian recording a tale and the teller providing us details.  It kept things interesting and revealed the plot in multiple parallel layers.<br />I could easily see this series moving into my 'most memorable (in a good way) of all time' list.<br />Fixes by location will be posted in a comment.
B005PK553C|5.0|I can't wait for more episodes....I hope there is more to come.  Many hours of excellent entertainment for just a few dollars!
0345529057|3.0|It's a great deal for 4 large books from a bestselling author. However, there are some grammatical errors throughout the books. In one of the books, there was a black smudge, but luckily it only covered 3 words at the bottom of the page. Overall, you get what you pay for I guess..
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|like game play so far...only a few levels in but its a hidden object game that's pretty fun. don't know yet how long it is but will find out. get this as a free app. its worth it...
B007SGM084|4.0|Loved reading, but I know that it could have been condensed into one book!  Hard to put down and worth reading to the end. Definitely recommend.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|Gritty, believable plot, good acting/characters and leaves you with a lonely-triumphant, harsh western feel...I enjoyed it.  There, that's my review.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|this app is great i just wish there would be more support for cloud services. the adobe reader is also a bit slow
1466401885|5.0|Great story and characters! Read it twice, back-to-back! I immediately ordered McGuire's other books and they are on the way.
B00884GR0W|1.0|first off the game lags like you wouldn't believe. also the graphics of the characters are good but they have like 100 life and you can only hit like -1 damage. the landscape is horrible. and when you try to break a block you have to stand right in front of it or on top. and it takes like a minute to break the stupid thing.  and building stuff is impossible it wount put a block down where you want it.. maybe next to it ...just horrible
0345803485|5.0|I loved this trilogy.. I have passed my copy to many friends, family members and coworkers and everyone thought it was one of the best reads they have had.  I will read it again and again.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun game. great graphics. can be repetitive. My favorite part is sliding under things. I think the sound effects are poor and often play with the sounds muted
B006LSZECO|4.0|on her own path.  I found this book riveting and disturbing to read, given the sociopathic - psychopathic, in some cases - motivations of the players.  It's very believable in its darkness contained in ordinary events of life and how they impact a set of characters.  I read a lot of mysteries and thrillers and this still has me shivering imagining these people.  A very intelligent writer.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I've enjoyed all of Johns books up until this one. Any reviews of this over 2 stars utterly baffle me... I mean I'm going to give it one, but I could see pulling a two out of it, just because I like the author. I wasn't a huge fan of Zoes war or whatever, but it was a good read either way.. just not exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />BUT THIS BOOK, THIS BOOK RIGHT HERE.<br /><br />Man, what the hell? It was terrible. This is the first Scalzi book that didn't make me laugh aloud once, every 30 pages or so I had to put it down because the characters just annoyed the piss out of me. I think he re-watched ST:TNG on Netflix one to many times then smoked himself retarded on some dank and tried to write this book. Seriously bad. Sir, have you picked up a cocaine habit? Adderall?<br /><br />Anyway, I remain a fan, but from now on will await reviews and perhaps even read a few chapters in a (gasp) bookstore before making future purchases. Looking forward to your next story in hopes it's nothing like this. Different strokes for different folks, but wow, this one threw me off.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|love the graphics and story! If you like missing objects games this is a fun one to try. The story line involves ghosts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Lordy, Lordy, What a book! Bought this book knowing full well what it was about. Didn't think I would like it, but wanted to see what all the hype was about. Well....I was wrong! Couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to buy the next one and then the third one! Loved the story-line. (Not so much the over abundance of sex) A little would have been sufficient. I mean, come on, WE GET IT! LOL
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love hidden object games and am thrilled with this one.  I got the full version and can't put it down. Very cool!
B008COII1Y|5.0|Like the others, I was walking into this thinking, \\"Oh, zombies and Civil War era, okay, sounds like a fun, cheesy movie.\\"  I was more than pleasantly surprised by what this movie is - a well-crafted script, good acting, excellent narration by the wonderful Brian Cox.  The zombies are well done (and the filmmakers brilliantly used creepy animation to avoid casting hundreds of extras as zombies and having to do make up for so many people in various scenes - the animated vignettes are infrequent enough to add to the ambiance and not scuttle the overall effect), the costuming and sets and scenery are aces.<br /><br />If you don't like zombie movies, you probably still won't like this - it is still a zombie movie, but it is one that has an excellent backstory, there are levels to the story and most people should get some enjoyment out of it.  It is a small budget production, so the people complaining about the production values are just being asinine.  For what it is, this is a wonderfully crafted movie and I completely enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|3.0|it was really fun but its not for the kindle fire and when you get it you will know why
B007I2BZIE|2.0|So, I sprung for the new Rush Album, \\"Clockwork Angles.\\" I listened carefully to the entire CD. As pronounced in a Jewish stereo type voice while shrugging my shoulders and holding out my hands sideways; \\"Meh.\\"<br /><br />Be ready for some of the same-ole-same-ole. As much as Neil Peart is amazing as always, the songs are simply just mediocre at best. I'm not looking for another pop song, but Clockwork Angles provides nothing memorable, nothing radio friendly, nothing that will survive time. No Limelight or Test for Echos or Red Barchetta, just song after song of \\"meh\\" with some special moments in a few songs. Although it's a different concept album, it follows in the footsteps of every other song they have done since Presto. The diehards will likely eat it up as always, but the CD will probably collect dust in my over sized collection of music. Alex Lifeson sounds exactly the same on guitar as he has always done on every single song he has ever played since his inception. Don't look for anything inventive by him here. You would think with all the years of experience, he may change the sound of his guitar and style of playing on at least one song, but......NOPE. Oh, Getty Lee did discover using a volume horn while singing in certain parts of a song. He must have learned that from JD on Rock Star INXS.<br /><br />More importantly, the engineering of this CD is simply horrible. Clearly mixed for the iPod user. Nothing but over compressed mushy cymbals over screechy guitars and three note synth playing all in the same frequency range with absolutely no dynamics.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The CD has it's moments, but moments are far and few between. The band hasn't been relevant in over 15 years and this CD is nothing more but the same old recycle material, including expressions like, \\"machinery, spirit, synchronized, mystery, floating.......They seem to use these words like others use \\"the\\" and \\"it.\\"<br /><br />Now, where's my Porcupine Tree CD?
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|so far I really like this game.  I love hidden object games some of which are so hard you cant even locate the objects or navigate through the game.  some so easy you finish them in no time.  so far this one falls right in the middle.  good game for FREE!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a fun game- my son enjoys it as much as I do!  use parental controls to block any purchases you don't want tho.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|everything is facebook. its retarded that to continue you need to have a facebook. I cant have a facebook. I hays this game because of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for temple run to be in the appstore for months!!!I just visited the appetite and it was there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Had it not been for the multitude of 5-star ratings I may have skipped over this book.  Couldn't put this book down and just bought #6.  Lots of praises sung here so instead of trying to think of a uniquely glowing review I'll just say \\"Ditto\\".  Enjoy!
030758836X|5.0|It's rare (for me at least) to read a film noir book but this book was so reminiscent of old suspense movies; Dial M for Murder and Double Indemnity kept floating through my mind. Things are rarely as they seem in life and never has that cliche been more apt in a story. I've read Gillian Flynn's previous two books, I became thoroughly engrossed mainly because her characters are so real, they lie, they have ugly sides, they aren't especially nice people. I find that I can't stop reading on because while I'm busy trying to decide whose side I'm on, who deserves the comeuppance... the characters are evolving like people tend do. Gillian Flynn does not give us a protagonist and an antagonist, she gives us masterful stories and riveting reads.<br /><br />Now I'm back to where I was last week before I read Gone Girl; I can't wait for the next Gillian Flynn book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a fun game and fairly fast pace. doesn't take too long to make money. the energy takes a while to fill up though.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Even though bleakly bigoted treatment of blacks is represented, it is an ultimately uplifting story, filled with poignancy, humor, and hope.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|great on my kindle fire. I do not know why any one has given it less than 5 stars. love it!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Beautiful series. Love Whedon. Everything he does is golden. Seen this show too many times and the blu-ray is just so nice to watch.
B005FISC52|4.0|Great way to finish the series, blanket clinching and tear jerking. So sad it's over! It was great to see all the faces pop up for the last few episodes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|short games but a decent variety.  good for being a free game.  this is especially easy for younger kids and it will keep them interested for a long time trying to unlock all of the different levels.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome.  It has nice graphics and details.  It is very addictive.  I play it all the time.  I enjoy all the different obsticles.  I highly suggest getting<br />&quot;Temple Run&quot; as your app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. love the graphics sand the charecters. fun fin fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.
0547569653|5.0|Scott Jurek is an amazing runner, an excellent speaker and an incredible writer! This book is easy to read and impossible to put down. It speaks to anyone wanting to eat healthier and to runners - from 5k to ultra marathoners. It is inspirational and entertaining. Plus the recipes are amazing! I now make the chili recipe frequently and LOVE the pre workout drink. Definitely a must read!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed each and every book.  Kept me wanting to read to see what happened next.  If E.L. James was to write another book about Christian and Ana I would be one of the first to buy it.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It's got a ton of options! I think the red-eye edit could be improve upon. But other than that, I find myself using this often!
B007QXWV1U|1.0|It's got quite a few edits but a majority of them are the same and gets boring fast. Some of the edits are very inaccurate and will put the subjects face well off center making it useless. With perfectly good pictures it constantly gives me a \\"can't find face please try another picture\\" error. The finished/processed image many times is of very poor quality and useless for anything else but a good laugh. There are alot of edits in the pro version but as I said earlier a majority of them are the same or just plain stupid and look ridiculous after processing. Many \\"monster\\" edits, no matter the crop, are so zoomed in that the original picture is colorless or lack color while the added monster effect is sharp and highly colored making the end product look just plain dumb. The animation edits, although they work, are poorly executed and look ridiculous when processed as well. Seems as though the program was thrown together without any real thought to the end product as far as real quality is concerned. It may be a program for a few laughs but gets old and repetitive real fast and only a few of the many edits are worth anything. Should only cost about .99 as 2.99 for pro is wayyy to much.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This game is just okay - nothing special. I really was expecting more since they charge so much. Objects are easily found, you can zoom the screen and there are plenty of hints. After each level it keeps asking for me to log into Facebook. ANNOYING!!! The story is forgettable (I honestly forgot it since last night), the graphics are ok, there is too much dialogue. and the guy in the hat - I just want to smack that smirk right off his face!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I really enjoy the G5 games; wish they were not so expensive.  I have very limited income And wouldn't mind paying a dollar or so but $5 per game is too much for me.  The one downside to the game is the repeated notice to open Facebook which I have no interest in!  Other than that this game is great on my KF.  Thanks to Amazon and G5 for making PA the FAOTD!
B0015DYIH2|1.0|the first book was a meh to me. you could make fun of it and power through it because the only good romance novel IS pride and prejudice by jane austen. this book [breaking dawn] had no real plot no real characters no consistoncy. AT ALL, it had fake dumbos, fools and a bad role model for women good romance novels can actually have strong and smart women which i don't think stephenie meyer knows about. i wish i could give this book negative four stars because it was just a giant sex scene the only thing that would make this better she actually described the wedding instead of the birth scene scarring her fans for life! so there are GIANT plot holes and no action so avoid this lobotomy at ALL costs
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Downloaded this game for my kids, but I play as much as they do.  We loved the movie when we saw it, now we love the game.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I got the game today and have played it through a few levels so far. It is a lot of fun if you like finding hidden objects.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Roger O. Thornhill is a busy New York City advertising executive who loves his mother and loves his women. He's having an after-work drink with three buddies when he's abducted at gunpoint. They take him to a mansion in the country, and their boss, Lester Townsend, scrutinizes his captive: &quot;Not what I expected. A little taller. A little more polished than the others.&quot;<br /><br />Thornhill replies, &quot;Not that I mind a slight case of abduction now and then, but I have tickets to the theater this evening. To a show I was looking forward to!&quot;  And that sets the pace for the whole movie. Politely sinister. Classy humor. Thornhill is played with panache and great comic touch by Cary Grant. Townsend is played with sly menace by James Mason. The lovely Eva Marie Saint doesn't even appear in the 1st half of the movie, then her Eve Kendall takes over the screen and Thornhill's heart - but it costs her.<br /><br />&quot;North by Northwest&quot; has a couple of the most recognized and parodied scenes in films. The cropduster chasing Cary Grant in the middle of nowhere never loses its fear factor. And who can forget Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall climbing down Mt. Rushmore?<br /><br />I'm writing this review to let you know that the extras on the 50th Anniversary Edition, 2 DVD's, are simply excellent<br />[[ASIN:B002IKLZZY North by Northwest (Two-Disc 50th Anniversary Edition)]]:<br /><br />1.  &quot;Cary Grant: A Class Apart&quot;. First airing in 2004, this is an 87 minute episode of PBS's &quot;American Masters&quot; TV series. It is narrated by Helen Mirren and Jeremy Northam, with many movie clips and contributing commenters. Cary Grant was in 72 films, including 4 directed by Alfred Hitchcock. He ended his film career voluntarily, quitting while he was at the top. He passed away in 1986 of a stroke. Look at this list of interviewees for this special! I found this extra in-depth and interesting.<br />- Barbara Grant, his wife from 1981-1986<br />- Jeanine Basinger, film historian<br />- Roderick Mann, friend<br />- Nancy Nelson, author of &quot;Evenings with Cary Grant&quot;<br />- Betsy Drake, actor, his wife from 1949-1962 and an outspoken pistol!<br />- Elvis Mitchell, film critic for the &quot;New York Times&quot;<br />- Peter Bogdanovich, director (he knew Hitchcock and Grant personally, and he participates on the movie commentary track for the DVD Collector's Edition of &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;)<br />- Martin Landau, actor, who plays James Mason's secretary, Leonard, in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;<br />- James Harvey, film historian<br />- Ralph Bellamy, actor, from a 1988 interview (he's not in this film)<br />- Todd McCarthy, author &quot;Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood&quot;<br />- David Denby, film critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;<br />- Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., actor, from a 1988 interview<br />- Howard Hawks, director, from 1967 interview. He directed Grant in &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940) and &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938)<br />- Dina Merrill, actor<br />- Jill St. John, actor<br />- Sidney Sheldon, writer<br />- Ralph Laren, designer, friend<br />- Eva Marie Saint, actor<br />- Mel Shavelson, director, he directed Grant in &quot;Houseboat&quot; (1958)<br />- Deborah Kerr, actor, from 1988 interview<br />- Ernest Lehman, screenwriter for &quot;North by Northwest&quot;<br />- Alfred Hitchcock, director, from 1966 interview<br />- Stanley Donen, directed Grant in &quot;Charade&quot; (1963, with Audrey Hepburn)<br />- George Kennedy, actor, from 2003 interview<br />- Samantha Eggar, actor<br />- and, last but not least, Cary Grant, in that they read excerpts from a series of autobiographical essays that were published in 1963. Grant gave few interviews, but he did open up in these essays.<br /><br />2.  &quot;The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style&quot;. This is a 57 minute documentary from 2009. This was also fascinating to watch. It starts with Alfred himself saying, &quot;It may be that I was born with the sense of drama&quot;!<br />  A little bit of everything is covered in this extra, from costumes to music, to Hitchcock's preference for cool blonde leading ladies. Most of the comments, however, and not unexpectedly, have to do with his direction. How he made the angles, light, composition, point of view and camera tell the story and paint the mood. An impressive list of directors talk about Hitchcock's genius:<br />- Francis Lawrence, director of &quot;I Am Legend&quot; and &quot;Constantine&quot;<br />- William Friedkin, director of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot;<br />- Guillermo del Toro, director of &quot;Pan's Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Hellboy&quot;<br />- John Carpenter, director of &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Escape From New York&quot;<br />- Richard Loncraine, director of &quot;Firewall&quot;<br />- Martin Scorsese, director of &quot;Goodfellas&quot;<br />- Curtis Hanson, director of &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;<br />- Joe Carnahan, director of &quot;Smokin' Aces&quot;<br /><br />3.  &quot;The Making of North by Northwest&quot;, hosted by Eva Marie Saint. Interesting stories are told by several people, including Pat Hitchcock, the director's daughter, and Ernest Lehman, writer for &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. Lehman talks about the genesis of the plot, when Hitchcock tells him: &quot;I've always wanted to do a chase across the faces of Mount Rushmore.&quot;<br /><br />4.  &quot;North by Northwest: One for the Ages&quot;, a short. This looks like it is made up of unused material from extra #2, &quot;The Master's Touch&quot;. Also interesting.<br /><br />5.  Stills Gallery<br />6.

1594630844|5.0|I read this book before I purchased it and was so impressed with it that I bought copies for my three sons and their families.  I just wished I'd been wise enough to offer them the advice that was collected from hundreds of \\"wise Americans.\\"<br /><br />Since then, I've used it as as a jumping-off point for discussions with my 80-90 year old friends.
0099579936|1.0|Holy cow. I felt like I was reading a playboy magazine or a dirty jokes book. Def not buying the others.
0307951529|5.0|This is a very bad book to read... right before you go to bed.  It's impossible to go through this book and not have your imagination shift into overdrive, ideas start flowing on page 1 and don't let up till long after you've finished the last chapter.  The stories in the book are equally instructive and inspirational.  And, Chris' writing is so clean and clear that you truly believe not only that you too can free yourself from the 9-5 and start your own occupational adventure.  Plus, you feel like you have a really straightforward prescription for how to do so.  It's a great read for anyone who has struggled with a \\"real job\\" for longer than 30 minutes and is ready to take control of his/her (work) life so as to find greater fulfilment and satisfaction.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|very good movie we enjoyed it alot and would watch it over and over again thanks amazon for your good movie collection
B007NESBK2|5.0|After all those years whitout new material, Sade has blazed me with the new and old songs.<br /><br />It is amazing how she still can surprize me even playing the old material.<br /><br />The show is beautifully conceived to the pleasure of the viewer/listener and the Bluray captured this to your living room screen.<br /><br />You can put it side by side with Lovers Rock live in sound quality, but the new show has great new songs.<br />Sade still moves like a mix of a snake and a cat and can sing as the time has never pased.<br /><br />It is a must have
B0072GPQNG|5.0|wow what an action movie i loved it from start to finish even found myself crying at the end of the movie a+ thanks amazon
B007P3TMW2|5.0|This was a fabulous movie.  We rented the video from Amazon and watched it on a sunny afternoon in our living room.  When the movie was over we felt like we'd watched it in a dark theater with surround sound.  We don't have any fancy equipment.  The movie just drew you in so completely that you lost track of where you were.<br /><br />The reviews are oddly fragmented and I think there are a couple of reasons for that:  1) it deals with a very heavy subject, the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and 2) people were expecting to see a movie starring Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks.  Instead, the movie starred an incredible new youngster who was able to carry an entire feature length film.  His performance was beyond belief.  Amazing!  The big names only had supporting roles to young Thomas Horn, and Bullock and Hanks performed those roles with their normal excellence.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie, telling stories of loss, grief, and the warmth and strength of the human spirit.  It was an amazing movie, one that captivated us like nothing has in recent years.  Make sure you have a couple boxes of tissues on hand and prepare to be uplifted in the end.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|couldnt figure this one out maybe i didnt download it right so i deleted it thanks amazon free apps i will keep it up
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The action, intensity of the opening scenes, special effects, and back-stories were so amazing! Seeing the Enterprise with a Titanium-looking facade gave it a very WWII bomber feeling and set that tone for a classic \\"this is not a drill\\" do or die mission! Future Spock and Young Spock was a great twist! The casting was perfect. Whoever designed the Romulan Ship and their look made them look B-A-D in a good way! Highly recommend if you like excitement and gew up with the orignal Star Trek like I did.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use, accurate  information, I use it first thing each day, a must have for anyone who works outside.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. I enjoy playing it. Its a fun batch of games. Would recommend if you like arcade type games.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lep's world is reminiscent of the first Super Mario game to come out way back when. I grew up playing that game and I've been looking for a similar game to play on my kindle fire, this game is it. I got the free version and have been playing non-stop for two days with no end in sight to the number of levels (unlike the one available in the Apple store which ends after 5 levels).
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a grew pass time for when you have nothing else to do. Has never lagged on me yet bit of heard of it lagging after long use.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all the books in this series. the first book was good, a lot was left out why Christian did not like to be touched, this issue should have been raised and more information should have been spent on this as well. It would give us all an idea of what his issue was with regards to this. The second books to the last book was also ok. I read a lot of these books and can say they are all predictable. Good reads but need more depth. I do recommend you read them all and post your own decisions.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So exciting, very addictive, you can not be squeamish and read this book.  It was a look into a world tha I am unfamiliar with but am curious about.  It has brought a different sense of sexy into my marriage and I am excited to see more from these author.  O so sexy! You fall in and out of love with Christian but you do root for this couple to be successful the entire book os the ending is appropriate.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I had only heard \\"We Are Young\\" on the radio, but I sampled the rest of the songs and they also seemed interesting.  When the album went on sale for $5 and there was a $2 credit available, it seemed worth a shot.  I was incredibly surprised about how well this album is put together.  The songs flow nicely from one track to the next, and the music is much better than I expected.  I was honestly expecting a 1-hit wonder, but the tempo changes in \\"We Are Young\\" caught my attention enough to give these guys a shot.  If that sounds familiar to you too, try the album.  You won't be disappointed.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is the first game app that has given me a wonderful experience. The only problem I've had is with it needing to be forced closed. Even so it didn't take away thing away from actual game play.  Closing the game turns out to be fortunate as it will keep me on track for getting to an appointment on time!<br /><br />Thanks so very much for creating this fabulously fun game!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Oregon trail is a great game because you can learn about how people used to live. also how they worked hard.
B007SGM084|5.0|Too much fun.  I'm so glad I am finished so I can get back to reading something that will put me to sleep at night!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It's a great game and it doesn't require real money to advance I bought all the characters with hard work.<br />But I'm afraid that some people are real idiots, because they say it's a sham if it's a five star review I'm not being paid to review this.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I LOVE CD+DVD combos.  They're always an awesome value.  And this one's no different!<br /><br />Richard sounds -- and looks -- really great.  I would even argue he's at his best... even better than the original recordings.  All the hits are present including one's he's written for other artists like Keith Urban, 'N Sync... and wwwhhhhhaaattt???... Hugh Jackman singing the song Richard wrote for Josh Groban?!?!  Awesome!  Plus the DVD production just looks top notch.<br /><br />Get this now!  You'll love it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so fun its just like tjlhe wii game super Mario bros its a good game to pass the time and help stragity Great Game
B006X3VNJK|5.0|Many of the currently re-released and so called \\"remastered\\" classic albums from days of yore sound worse than the originals did, due, in large part, to large amounts of compression that the studios are now employing. This compression squishes the dynamics, robbing the listener of the 'high fidelity' sound that the original typically has, in many cases. Happily, this is not the case with Donald Fagen's The Nightfly, which was recorded, mixed, and mastered extremely well on its original release LP, providing an excellent base (in the original master tapes) from which to start. This remaster not only rivals the sonics of the original album, but the vinyl surface of the remaster is so quiet, it could ~almost~ pass for that of a CD. (In the spirit of full disclosure, I must include the fact that the original LP I ordered had a tremendous sonic glitch about 45 seconds into Track 1, Side 1, and had to be returned for exchange. The replacement, however, had all the wonderful characteristics of which I speak.) If you like this album and you like vinyl, buy this - it's great!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally this app has come out it is just like my iphone 4s thank you amazon appetite its aboiut time kindle fire RUUUUUUUUUULLLLEEESSSS
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesone and so much fun :) I hope there is more games like this later on and they should update this game so I can have more stuff :)
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|nice game my son enjoyed playing not required to buy anything so that's a plus.not too hard for younger kids
0143121006|4.0|This was a true to life tale of the sordid conditios of life in early China. It was surprising to me that there were so many Britains there. Also russians and Japan was also invading China. A well written book.<br />Note - i did purchase this from Amazon.
0553284347|5.0|I saw this book in a Barnes and Noble once, I joked about buying it. I thought that my parents weren't as bad as I was making them out to be. 3 years later I found myself constantly down and out and I had all of this anger stored inside. I remembered this book, and came to Amazon to purchase it. It has been 100% worthwhile. It is helping me realize the way my toxic shaped me and teaching me how to overcome these things. I definitely recommend this book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just another 5 star fan of Hugh Howey's Wool series. I don't know how anyone could dislike any of these books.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|works great on kindle fire. just wish items were a little clearer when you zoom in. other than that, very fun.
0345803485|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect.  My sister-in-law suggested the book to me, but before I could start reading it there was a big explosion on TV about it and the pros and cons of it being erotic.  Which made me very disappointed, since I really don't like romantic erotica.  Yet, I gave it a try and was immediately impressed by the first few pages.  This is no cheap novel.  E. L. James is a supurb writer.  The characterization is one of the best I've read in a long time.<br /><br />As far as the erotic goes, I would disagree that it is even erotic.  Yes, it's there, but it seems to be more a part of the conflict in the story than something there to turn the reader on.  The hero of the story is not even a hero, but a victim that needs saving.  The heroine, an unexpected leader that shows him the way.<br /><br />This book is very hard to put down, extremely well-written, and contains some the most interesting and well-written characters I've read.  I would recommend this book.
0385344228|4.0|I did like this story, but found the whole setup to be quite confusing, or perhaps it's me.  But there seem to be two stories going on at the same time, when we realize one happened first, and one is happening as we read.  However, in the end trough all the legal and psychobabble in the relationships and situation, I still<br />seem to be a bit dumbfounded with the ending.  I do love legal, court type stories, and this one is quite detailed with it's characters, etc., and I like the psychology of the matter as well.  Landay did manage to keep me confused through most of the story though which is OK as well.  I found it slow reading, and I did read it slowly and carefully because of the confusion in my mind.  But quick readers will like it as well.
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|I get this is sort of a send up of an 80's classic, but it gets a bit insulting to the fans of the original. Channing Tatum's performance is surprisingly good, but Jonah Hill sucks the life out of about every scene he's in. His one-trick pony approach to being funny just gets old after about 5 minutes. I wish that I had something more positive to say, but this movie is pretty awful if you ever appreciated anything about the source material. If you have no clue that this was based on something else, I hear it's mildly humorous! ;P
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|My wife and I have recently returned from our honeymoon in London and Paris. While in London, we were able to catch the actual musical at one of the opera houses. It was an amazing experience. From the costumes to the cast, everything was beautiful. After we watched the musical I told my wife that there was a 25th Anniversary blu-ray that I think we should buy since it was done at the Royal Albert Hall. This blu-ray of the 25th Annvierary did all that is Phantom of the Opera justice. The cast was, again, amazing! Especially the one who played the Phantom, Ramin Karimloo, his voice matched the character so well. The cast on the blu-ray was four to five times bigger than the one we watched it London so it was overwhelming to see all those people fit on one stage.<br /><br />You HAVE to watch the whole disc. Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber makes an appearence with the original cast from London. The 'concert' at the end is amazing because you will see how each cast member appreciates each other. Some of the cast members on the disc were actully the ones performing at the live show we went to in London.<br /><br />Overall, this is an amazing disc. If you're into musicals and you have surround sound, blast it! Hearing every note is wonderful!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was hard to put down loved it !<br />Without spoilers this book was amazing,<br />I  fell in love with the chactators at times even cried .<br />even bought the seconds book before I was done .<br />So there wouldn't be a laps in following this book story .<br />Even buying the trilogy all three books for my best friend .
0439023513|4.0|I liked the book but am unable to rate as high as the first two. I would have liked to learn more of their lives after the games. I felt the ending was rushed.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Really, this was one of the best books I've read in a while, and absolutely the best indie book I've ever read. Also, for people who hesitate to read a series thats not complete yet, it ends really well and doesn't leave a big nasty cliff hanger.
B00881VLCE|3.0|its ok you do have to get more pictures which I don't particularly like.  its a good thing it is free.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I've liked some other games more.  There is way too much dialog. I would rather have more game and less &quot;story&quot;.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. I love things that are smaller than the original. thing. And it is on my kindle so I can keep track of it.
0345803507|5.0|I've read all 3.  I highly recommend this trilogy especially if you like to read erotica.  I think it's equally erotic for men as it is for women.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I started reading the novels because of the HBO series.  I'm very glad that I did.  In many cases, there's a sense of disappointment in the differences between books and the television shows or movies made from them.  This isn't the case with the A Song of Ice and Fire series.<br /><br />In this second novel of the series, we find the land split with multiple kings fighting one another for the right to power.  I was excited to find my favorite characters from the first novel continue their journeys and face new troubles.  The main characters have a great deal of depth.  The author has continued his pattern of writing each chapter from the point of view of one of those main characters.  This is a must read for anyone who enjoyed the first novel.  I don't know if I can wait for the third season of the show to start before reading the third novel.  I look forward to seeing what's in store for everyone.
0345803493|5.0|This book was my favorite out of the three.  I can't wait for E.L.James to write more !!  It would be interesting froma psychological stand point if she wrote the story from his perspective.  This one I couldn't put down.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The most fun I have had in a while. I recommend this app to anyone that enjoys games where you need to find things.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a fantastic  book. It grabs your attention and keeps it. It is a book really...really...hard to put down.  I am anxious to begin book 2. I sure hope the author has another set of trilogy ready by the time I finish this one as good. Thumbs up to the author !
B003IKMR0U|4.0|A fun \\"push your luck\\" style game.  The cardboard cylinder didn't hold up long, but a shot of hot glue corrected that issue.  My kids also enjoyed (and groaned) the dice game.  Fun for beach or just pass time.<br /><br />6/3/13 update:  This game continues to be a hit for filling time between occasions.  Can't wait to add the expansion.  Cannister still holding up!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun. some may work better with stylus. I'm not sure Bc I don't have one. kids enjoy it though and me too.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Updated (7/3/2014)<br /><br />First let me say that I've tried numerous apps to stream music and video.  There was always an issue that made the apps less than stellar.  Plex gives me 99% of what I want!<br /><br />Positives<br />---------<br />- Stream movies and videos to iPhone, Android tablets (HP Touchpad running CyanogenMod 9, Kindle Fire HD, HP Slate) and HTC One phone (devices that I have)<br />- Integrates with iTunes so that my 120GB music database can be played anywhere<br />(I have moved to Subsonic for music streaming.  It does a much better job with music.  Perhaps one day Plex will be there as well.)<br />- iTunes playlists on home PC are seen with Plex client so I can easily stream music while driving (no more Pandora, Spotify, etc.)<br />(Yeah, still works, but it's not reliable.)<br />- Plex client login allows you to see all of your libraries automatically, no matter what device you are using<br />- Plex app for Roku so that I can stream home videos, movies, music to TVs.  You can take this little box with you on vacation, hook it to a TV, connect via integrated WiFi and have access to all of your multimedia just as if you were home as well as NetFlix and other apps.<br />(Just make sure that you are converting your files to something Roku likes.  I tried the Amazon Fire TV and the video files that stream flawlessly under Roku were choppy with Amazon Fire TV and Plex.)<br />- Integrated database populates the metadata for music and movies instantly.  No need to use a metadata manager.<br />- TV Show series look great and contain all of the info about each episode.<br />- The quality of the videos can be adjusted automatically or manually based on your connection speed so you can stream over 3G or slow WiFi connections.<br />- DLNA support in latest beta.<br />(This works but I see it as a last resort when you have a device (TV) that has apps but not Plex.)<br />- You can share your libraries with other Plex friends.<br />(I am using this more andmore.  You can have control over what your friends and kids can view.  There is also a Plex Notify app that will send you a text whenever someone starts watching a video.)<br /><br />Negatives<br />---------<br />- Kindle Fire performance is poor.  You can make some changes to the Plex settings to improve quality.  I got my son's to work pretty well. Search the Plex forum for \\"kindle fire\\" to get info on this.<br />(This is not an issue anymore, at least on the Fire HD and HDX.)<br />- No social network integration.<br />- You really need to be on a 192.168.x.x network for stuff to work correctly.  This was an issue for me but I bit the bullet and moved everything over.<br />(I don't think this is an issue anymore.)<br />- Unsupported devices (like my HP Touchpad) may sometimes have playback issues but clearing the cache usually gets around it.  Hey, it works so I am not really complaining.<br />- DLNA implementation is just OK.  DLNA is a PITA anyway in my opinion.<br /><br />This is all just off the top of my head.  I'm sure most of the 1-star reviews are for the Kindle Fire performance.  The Plex Windows Server is free.  All you pay for are the client apps.  You can have multiple Windows servers (I have 3 serving up different media types).  Also, just got back from the Outer Banks in NC.  Other than some dropouts along the coast (where cell service is questionable), there were no lost connections as I streamed music via Plex to my iPhone in the van with Bluetooth and that's a 6-hour drive.  No more downloading music or managing playlists on multiple devices.  Do it once on your PC and it is accessible with every Plex client.  Can't beat it.<br /><br />(I've now used Plex for over 2 years and it is awesome for movies and videos.  Just not so much for music.  No other app comes close.)<br /><br />Hope this review helps. :-)
B007I2BZIE|1.0|Long time Rush fan. Missed their last tour due to work piling up. I bought this album after listening to the band talk about returning to their early values. I guess you should be careful about what reference point you establish. I listened to the album 3 times looking for somethng memorable and just couldn't find it. It is technically well-played and has hints of Rush all over it. Other than the label, I can't find anything on the album that inspires me to play it again... ever. I just couldn't get attached to it like their early work. I gave it to my best friend, also a big fan, without saying a word. He called me the next day and said the same thing. Nothing grabbed him. My memory is such that I can remember every note of an album and re-play it in my head at will. I can't remember a single tune from this album. Technically well-palyed, content irrelevant, emotional snooze-fest. Sorry guys, I tried. I hope my money helped finance your retirement.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is truly a great book. The conception is vast and original, the writing is extremely good, entertaining, deep and credible. As a self-published first novel, it is amazing. It is part of a trilogy, so we can look forward to the next two items.<br />I bought this book because of its unusually and consistently good reviews, that were many and convincing. For once, the reviews were right. I strongly recommend this book. If you like very good phantasy, or simply very good fiction, you should read it.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|In ways, this was the best show I'd seen from HBO to date... yet, in ways, it felt stifled from being true entertainment.<br />I've read comments that people thought this show had parts that were too raunchy to be true to the books and I'll admit, though I haven't read the book, there were nude/sex scenes that simply didn't feel true to the overall presentation, let alone feel right anyway.<br />The story itself was very strong, not just in concept and presentation, but also in execution from all the points-of-view, especially that of Khaleesi and her husband. There plenty of shocking moments throughout the season to amp up the action and whatnot (honestly, the lack of Whitewalkers after the first episode was rather disappointing, but if that's how it is in the book, then I've just shownm my ignorance, haven't I? ;) as well as to provide extra character-based moments in later episodes. The cast theirselves were great, each holding true to who they were, even through each one's own overall progression.<br />I just hope they'll decide to make the next season more organically sound as a companion piece to the book rather than follow some raunchy quotas from HBO to make non-book fans of tv shows happy and have fans of the book be ecstatic.<br />(Hint, hint, HBO)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like the game but the reseting time is so ANNOYING!! I got used to it and played another game until finished.<br /><br />Get game: Only if you're good waiting<br /><br />Also in The Oregon Trail&trade; I liked it until the level when you only get money but they added new things like Prospecting New houses and more so get the game!!!
1781161097|4.0|This was a very well presented 'Art of' book for Ridley Scott's Prometheus. It has some wonderful shots of the pre-production designs as well as behind the scenes photos of the sets and filming. However, like many newer books of its ilk, it it flawed. It does not showcase the entire production from beginning to end, and by that I mean concepts that were dropped or alternate avenues of exploration considered, especially since much of the story was being rewritten at the time. It was like a PR person went to town on it. Instead, it only showcases the choice pieces, those that only made it into the film.<br /><br />One such design (Spoilers ahead!) was the Deacon, the final design for the chestburster alien. The book only has six photos or so of the sculpture and prop they used, and even then only a few of the actual concept designs. Where are the drawings? Surely the design team made more than six perfect designs. They go into great detail explaining the process, such as taking inspiration from the goblin shark, but do little in actually showing it. I had to Google most of the designs that never saw print. And let me tell you, they are far and away different than the ones in the book!<br /><br />When you consider the original Alien movie, as well as the original 'making of' and Giger's Alien books, they explored a lot of dropped designs. For me, an 'Art of' book should have the entire process from the failed to the successful. After all, it's the journey that's the most satisfying, not the destination.<br /><br />Having said my piece, don't let it dissuade you from purchasing this book. It made a fine addition to my collection as well as, I'm sure, your own. I do recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is repetitive.  its free and fun and its addicting to go farther and farther. I always played it on my bfs ipod and now I can play it on my kindle. definately worth it
B005HP2J66|3.0|Werner Herzog is given intimate access to the earliest instance of cave painting known to modern man, the Chauvet Cave in southern France. It's a mesmerizing topic, but after the third or fourth time the screen pans dramatically across the same six sketches, it's clear that elaboration just isn't in the cards. Rather than using these caves as a jumping-off point to discuss early man and his habit of cave painting in general, Herzog stands in place and explores the particulars of these specific illustrations. Which is his prerogative, granted, and fully excusable if he's able to find enough meat to justify the narrow perspective. Ultimately he doesn't, though, and his long, dull conversations with the local team of researchers only further belabor a struggling theme. Dry and emotionless as a textbook with just one or two moments of wonder, it's too much for a TV episode and too little for a feature-length documentary.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|When I played this game 6 time it stopped working. I like this game but I just cant get it to start. :'(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would have read it quicker if it wasnt for my two year old needing mommy time. This book pulls you in and doesnt let go. It is so hot! I found myself daydreaming about Christian Grey. I did not want it to end....I havent had a book pull me in like this since Twilight. I dont recommend it for teenagers though. It is too sexually explicit. Their hormones are already raging enough.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I have come to love the hidden object games. couldn't stop long enough to leave a review until I had to take a bathroom break! love the hint option although I &quot;try&quot; not to use it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I am a huge lover of hidden object games. I have played this one on ipad, the computer and now the kindle fire. it is excellent on the fire.
0345803485|5.0|I literally read the entire first book in one day. Once you start reading, you can't put it down! I just wish there were more than three books in the series...
B007OAAK0O|3.0|I was searching for a good live dvd of Diana Ross. She had a concert in the Netherlands in 2010. Unfortunately the concert was not registered on DVD as a result of the bancrupcy of the organisation. The dvd is good in sound and picture, but it is very nineties! No grand stageworks, but a simple concert. Nowadays the artists perform their songs at live concerts with the same punctuality as a studio recording. In the seventies and eighties during the live concerts, the songs would be pitched up, like as twice the speed. I still don't understand why. Also with this concert, that is the case...Upside down, twice as fast is not nice...So overall enjoyable to see a skinny Diana Ross singing, but no spectacular concert. I hope she will make one before she's too old!!
0345803493|5.0|Fifty shades darker was definitely my favorite of the three books. In it you see a different side to both of the main characters, Ana and Christian. Such a sweet love story :)
B005LAIGSM|5.0|The movie is excellent.  My only complaint is I thought that all DVD movies that you purchase now are for widescreen.  This movie isn't.  If you use zoom on the remote that came with the DVD player you lose part of the picture.
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't wait to see what was coming on the next page.  You meet Mrs. Robinson.  Christian falls apart.  He's a twisted mess.  Ana's not- or is she?  Why would anyone hope for Christian and Ana to have a future together?  Yet, you do. Fantasyland at is best. Started the next book immediately.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is absolutely amazing and easy to use. it gave me a new love for photography and helped me recreate my vacation pictures!
0345803507|5.0|More Mrs. Robinson, more twisted truths about Christian, more disobedient acts from Ana, more, more, more... The only disappointing thing about this book is that it was the last of the 50 Shades trilogy! Looking out for the next one!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|G5 entertainment once again has produced a game of moderate challenge and maximum entertainment.  Beautiful artwork, and looks even better on tablet.
0345529057|5.0|I purchased this set of books for my granddaughter after having it recommended by friends.  She can't put them down and will be looking for me to purchase book number five.  The books shipped faster than the promised date.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game to to much I'm like obsessed with it again love it too too too much how can you make it so good
B0063IH60K|5.0|good app I enjoy playing it and like the variety of play options. free apps are always appreciated!  love solitaire.
B0086700CM|5.0|Best Game I've ever played. It's exciting challenging and intense :) The gorillas dnt even look like gorillas why does it where a skull as a mask?
B0026S1XD2|3.0|So I bought this cd for my dad that really wanted that particular album however did not realize that was a remix and not the original!!!! My dad got disappointed since all he wanted was just an original cd album!
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|hmmmm I hare it it is so boring plz plz plz don't buy it buy temple run now that is the best game ever:)
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I am absolutely thrilled &amp; so very excited to see G5's Paranormal Agency as today's FAOTD! Amazon has just saved me $4.99!<br /><br />I'd been seriously intending to purchase this very same app but, was waiting to first, finish up with another HO game that I'd bought from G5 Entertainment, just this past weekend!<br /><br />I love how this one really forces me to look for the hidden objects and not peices of them scattered about. Although, I don't mind them, I do prefer it this way.<br /><br />I found the graphics for the characters to be surprisingly bland &amp; without animation. I'm accustomed to seeing at least some animation as the story unfolds between scenes. For the $5, as well as 6 other games I've purchased, I had actually expected much better from G5 Entertainment.<br /><br />I like that there are twomodes of play; Timed &amp; Casual. I prefer the Casual but if you like a challenge then the timed eould be perfect for you.<br /><br />Other than the lack of animated characters &amp; the repetition of the same hidden objects, I am truly enjoying the game. However, I feel I must deduct at least one star.<br />If this game was as good as some of their others, such as their Mahjong apps, then I most certainly could see myself paying $4.99 for Paranormal Agency! Otherwise, I would definitely buy this at .99&cent;. I  would consider it a $1.99 and maybe even 2.99..the most!<br /><br />But...for today's FAOTD? ? Grab this while it's free! It's very much a fun game &amp; worth the download! Check it out! :)
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Probably like most I went looking for these guys after the \\"We are young\\" single for the kids and after spending $4.99(thank you Amazon) I have found another great band with a great album. Will be buying some of their older stuff.<br /><br />Really great album all of the way through - a couple places the auto-tune gets a little much but otherwise a wonderful surprise and solid listen over and over.<br /><br />And BTW: Amazon has the best music prices, I have an iphone and an itunes account and still buy everything through Amazon it pops right into itunes seamlessly!
B000I8ES5C|5.0|this is a fun movie about a cataplier to butterfly story. how a small community comes together to rid themselves of the tyrant. the stunts, dance & special effects are fabulous. this is a great movie. a must see...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game I love it its very fun 124 games<br />some parts are boring but fun you should try it
B0024SQW2Q|5.0|this is the third installment of the underworld franchaise. which this part explains about how two brothers are turned into the very first vampire & lycan (werewolf). the make up , special effects, stunts & storyline are great. if you like the first two then you will love this installment. a must see...
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!! PEOPLE SHOULD GET THIS GAME AND PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE THIS GAME YOU BETTER LIKE IT
B006TXDOZ0|5.0|This was my first experience with Band of Skulls - and was blown away.<br /><br />As a fan of most music genres, with affection for Classic Rock, it seems to be harder and harder to find bands with catchy riffs but who also come off unique.  Without trying to sound like a brand, I found a fantastic meld of Wolfmother and The Black Keys with Band of Skulls.<br /><br />The diversity of each track made for a VERY satisfying listen.<br />From the title track and \\"The Devil Takes Care of His Own\\" to \\"You're Not Pretty But You Got It Goin' On\\" (GREAT song title by the way) and the haunting final track, \\"Close To Nowhere\\" - All good stuff.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wanted to read this book because I heard so many people talk about it. It's an easy read and keeps you interested I couldn't put it down.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Do not get this if you do not have a lot of time to waste! I play this more than I should.... I really like this game! I like to draw items or write a hint! fun stuff even for a 38 year old with 4 kids.......
B0050UEVU0|3.0|The movie starts out with some thugs breaking into a car. Jason Statham does some illegal high sticking as he subdues them. He is a vigilante cop molded after Dirty Harry. The newspapers are crucifying him in the headlines, and he is nearly out of a job in London. Soon a cop serial killer (Aidan Gillen) appears on the scene. We know he is the killer as does the police. One of his killings is done in broad day light, yet they have trouble arresting him, even after they search his flat. And what was with the fat chicks dancing pretending to be sexy?<br /><br />We have seen rogue cop movies before and generally like them. This one brings nothing new to the table. If you are a fan of Statham's deadpan approach you might enjoy this film. Personally I felt, been there, done that, got the t-shirt while watching this film. The movie was boring even as Jason was shooting the bad guys in the head.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.
B007MG360G|5.0|I'm getting it right now as we speak so how is it I think its awesome is it guys and gals
0345803485|1.0|This is one of the poorest excuses for a romance novel I have ever read, and I only finished because I dislike starting something and not seeing it through.<br /><br />The bad writing was no surprise to me, considering that the entire trilogy is really a Twilight fanfic with some names changed, but that doesn't mean an editor shouldn't have taken a look at this. There were some areas of the book where there was either too much or not enough punctuation, and it was jarring. E.L. James also must not know what the definition of \\"irony\\" is, because she used it incorrectly several times. She also uses the same words over and over, to the point where you almost want to throw your book/e-reader in frustration.<br /><br />As another reviewer has noted, the characters really do seem to come right out of a teenager's fantasy: the quiet main character who wears cheap clothes and has low self esteem, the rich, gorgeous man who sweeps her off her feet and somehow loves her for who she is, the best friend who's just better at EVERYTHING, and, of course, is much prettier...the characters, to me, are like high school stereotypes.<br /><br />The sex scenes were just hilarious. I actually found myself laughing through them, which probably isn't a good sign. For example, when Ana and Christian start kissing, prior to sex: \\"This is wrong, but holy hell is it erotic.\\" Later, when they progress further: \\"He's my very own Christian Grey flavor Popsicle.\\"<br /><br />Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" is BEYOND irritating. I don't CARE about what this supposed \\"inner goddess\\" thinks, and it made the book even more stupid and Ana's character harder to believe. Examples:<br />\\"My inner goddes has her sequins on and is warming up to dance the rumba.\\"<br />\\"My inner goddess looks like someone snatched her ice cream.\\"<br />\\"My inner goddess sits in the lotus position looking serene except for the sly, self-congratulatory smile on her face.\\"  Really? Just typing that made me laugh. Sounds like somebody stillhas an imaginary friend.<br /><br />I also don't find Christian and Ana's relationship to be romantic at all. If anything, it bordered on abuse. BDSM, from what I understand, is supposed to be something that occurs between two loving adults who trust each other immensely. With Ana's thought processes and mindset, she's really no older than 15, if that. Yes, they have a contract (that is later ignored), but is that really a sign of love and trust? Ana feels like she needs to \\"fix\\" Christian, she'll only believe compliments if they come from him, she lets him talk her into doing things she doesn't want to do, she's unsure about their relationship, and he STALKS her. That's not love at all. He wants to control her and have her all to himself, plain and simple. That's not romantic at all, and it bothers me that so many people are treating this book like it's the best romance novel ever and women are set on finding their \\"Christian\\". This is NOT the book to use as a standard for finding romance.<br /><br />Overall, this was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I couldn't take it seriously at all, particularly during the sex scenes, and I don't find Christian's bouncing between being domineering and \\"vulnerable\\" endearing. The characters were so childish, undeveloped, and unrealistic that I couldn't connect with them at all. If you need any further proof of the ridiculousness of this and the other two novels, check out the Fifty Shades of Suck Tumblr.
0345803485|3.0|It was a major page turner, no denying that.  It could have been more effective without the multitude of trash that is very sad.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|i dont know  all the albums of talking heads,but  all songs are good , i recomend the cd for a begginer of knowing the band
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I would highly recomend this tv show to anyone ever. It is hands down the best show on tv currently!
B000000WJK|5.0|i recomend  a lot these album ,in some songs verbe plays a kind a soft but  they emerge  with power and sounds very nice
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After having seen the movie, I couldn't wait to read the book. This book has characters that keep the reader interested and the writer does  a great job at setting the various scenes throughout the book that keep the reader desiring more and more. It was a captivating read from start to finish. It has a great balance of fear, suspense, drama, romance and so much more. All I have to do now is read the other books in the trilogy. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is an easy read that draws you in from the beginning. Not gory which makes it work as a children/Teen book even if the subject matter is a bit mature. It's not Bradbury or London (the authors I had to read in English class) but it is entertaining. The ease of the read reminds me of \\"Where the Red Furn Grows\\" and would be an excellent book to get a child interested in reading. The story is a bit predictable but the character development is so good that it doesn't matter. You care about the characters and want to know what happens to them. I was so drawn in that as soon as I finished the 1st book (at 1am)I bought the 2nd on my Kindle right there in bed.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I was hoping it was another great David Baldacci book and it was. Downloaded it on my Kindle for a three-day trip to Boston and read it every chance I got. He has become one of my favorite authors.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I decided to buy Wool based on the reviews and the price. The only negative is I finished series, it's the kind of book/books you don't want to end. On the plus side the author isn't done yet. I enjoyed the character development along with the endless twists and turns the storyline takes. The books are very well written and I feel it's better than The Hunger Games trilogy. The story would make a great movie and I thinks it's just a matter of time before it happens! On a side note the author says the books are so cheap \\"because I'm a big fat nobody, that's why!\\" Not for long my friend, keep up the good work and may you make the fortune your stories are worth.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|looks like a great app but i can't do anything without it force closing at the home page. - very disappointed.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Without a doubt, this is the worst book I've ever read. The story itself had so much promise, but the writing let it down completely. I felt like I was reading a child's essay (except for the graphic sex scenes). The two main characters were wholly unbelievable and unlikeable, and I've never wanted to be finished reading a book so much in my life. I've read some dire fiction, but this is by far the worst. I'm really shocked at how well it's doing. I gave it one star because you cant give a review no stars on here for some reason. Avoid at all costs.
0345803485|1.0|When I was a teenager and got hold of a book with erotica I \\"skimmed\\" through the pages looking for the \\"good\\" parts.  With this book, I quickly turn pages looking for the \\"non-erotica\\" parts.  Needless to say, I got through the book really quickly on my Kindle.  I would say, don't waste your time.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|If you have read all the (accurate) 5 star reviews but are still unsure about paying the ridiculously low price for this book, just read the sample, and you will be hooked. The book only gets better as it develops. Can't wait for the sequel.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is an really great movie. It shows that there is still humanity left in this hard world and people that do still love and care. It shows determination and strength and hope and love. A must watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Seriously I could not put the book down, and was incapable of any social interaction before I was finished. Its different, exciting, interesting, unreal and extremely entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|loving it! Its a blast!Fast paced and lots of fun. l wont get bored with this game! Even my husband likes it!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its fun and awesome but its also confusing hard and frustrating but u should get it if u like being challenged
B005OHSUQK|5.0|Love Sons of Anarchy had to this episode and comtniue on the saga just cant get enough of the drama
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I dont know what everyone is blabbing about, it has a lot of nice features and works flawlessly on my phone. On Droid RAZR running 4.0.4 non-root
B000000XB8|1.0|This seller (0ldies) was disappointing as the vinyl they provided was a bootleg copy. The \\"fantasy\\" logo on the record was not the correct one and it was a very poor quality recording. I rather listen to an mp3 than this vinyl. All the songs are also cut (not full songs)and the vinl was badly warped... All in all very disappointing. If you buy from this seller expect to be spammed with snail mail (their catalog) all the time. See the other one star ratings, make sure not to buy from Oldies.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|love these games and this one is a lot of fun so far. hoping it doesn't t make me log into FB to continue.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|This is a fun game but, it runs in the background even if I force close it will be listed as running a few seconds later which kills my battery.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|one of those games that you can get lost in...for hours, without realizing where the time went!  Truly love it :-)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I completeltly disagree with the previous review. Yes chris nolan changed many things about batman, but what he stayed true to was the fact that batman was more on the lines of the comicsbthe dark knight which were dark, and very little humor. He made the characters intense and truly gives the feeling that batman is over his head, dealing with a city literally about to crumble. He made batman dark, and more realistic. Putting these criminal masterminds as masters of different mobs or in charge of asylum thugs, is a brilliant way if infiltrating gothams legal systems and to truly take down a city.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best app.  You have to get it or you are missing out.  I have unlocked everything and they are all fun.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Highly overated books.  It isn't worthy of the hype it is getting.  I have read all three books and kept expecting the story line to get better.  It never did.  $30.00 I'll never see again.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|i purchased this book based on 3 reviews i read--was not disappointed. it is so engrossing and well written that i did not want it to end. if you are a fan of the english language and like novels with plots,please read this book. it is wonderful.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. it comes in handy when I'm doing my homework. and if I wanted an improvement,  it would be the fact that the calculator needs a bit more style. but hey. its a tool for Pete's sake. its not made for style. its made for use.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|This is not like everyone think it is, it is not Alien prequel.<br />It capitalize on Alien popularity to create a buzz for this movie.<br />Then create a bunch of holes in the movie to make people talk about it, don't matter its good or bad.  I guess \\"there is no bad publicity\\" apply, at least people would be talking about the movie.  Well I would talk about the holes in the movie, the supporter of the movie would talk about the possibility of the hole with \\"it will be explained in part 2\\".  Because the hole is so big, there is a bunch of possibilities not everyone can be right.<br />I seriously hope there would not be part 2 because this first one is not that special, but because of the director's reputation I have no doubt he would get funds to make Prometheus 2 if he wanted.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Got a question regarding successful rich and powerful person Weyland in the movie:<br />Let's see Weyland can spend trillions for personal reasons, who does he hire?<br />1. Archeologist who is so stupid that she says this is scientific expedition, you will not need your weapons. What's worse is the guy listened.<br />2. Other archeologist did not report worm like infection in his eye, pretend like its nothing and went back on ahead to expedition.<br />3. Geologist hired to map the facility gets lost trying to find his way back.<br />4. Biologist stupid enough to try and pet an alien creature.<br />5. Weyland's bodyguard fires at Engineer's body which could be bullet proof suit, and not put a bullet to the uncovered head.<br />6. David gets himself killed when he either trying to get his \\"father\\" killed or communicate for his father, either way not so effective.<br />Weyland for a rich and powerful guy sure surround himself with incompetent people. Or maybe the inflation rate is so high, the trillion dollar is like our present day million dollars? Only way to explain the \\"quality\\" of employees he hired to save his life.<br /><br />BTW I know I am going to get lots of \\"unhelpful\\" on my feedback, that is the risk of bad review on a \\"popular\\" movie to a group of fans to a series or director.  Just like giving a bad review on a bad StarTrek movie and what Trekkies would react to that review.<br />Look I wanted this movie to be good, the previews on youtube was awesome and I love most of the Alien series.  I even pre-ordered this 3D Blueray before the movie came out, that is how much I wanted this movie to be good.  Only reason I am not cancelling this order is because it was cheap to own, also to show how much I wanted this movie to be good.<br />For people who saw this movie, ask yourself this question.  If you judge this movie based only on the story line and not on the actors, director, special effects, link to Alien or the hype, do you think it was a good movie? Many people would agree the answer would be a no.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very good game a real time spender sort of like tiny tower but ice age I say get it its worth it
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great dialog. I enjoy playing this game. I play Hidden Chronicles on FB and I was excited to find a hidden object game for my tablet. Graphics are terrific.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I haven't written a review in a very long time on here, but I couldn't resist not writing one for this which is fast becoming one of my BEST album purchases in years! While I loved Adam's first album, I didn't think he could top that, but boy was I wrong! This album is definitely a HUGE step UP from his last effort both in terms of energy, diversity, musicality, and even his unbelievable vocals. I have been unable to stop listening to this album since I got it on the day it was released (almost a month or so ago now) and I fear I am going to be wearing this one out. Every song is a gem on here and I'm sure the masses will each find a song that speaks to them personally. The lyrics (although at times a bit offensive), are very honest and come from the heart. The groove and musical hooks coupled with inventive instrumentations and of course his amazingly high-soaring melodies and harmonies make this a thoroughly infectious, catchy, and listenable album. GO GET ONE! Adam, you are unbelievably good! I just hope you keep making music like this! :) Peace and Blessings...
B0079XPUOW|1.0|What a let down after waiting for its release.  It was an expensive disappointment.  I have liked his other books, but this was the exception.
B0086700CM|5.0|My friend showed me this and I thought it looked super dumb. Then my sister downloaded it on my kindle fire and I thought &quot;I will try it grrrrr.&quot; Once I did I was addicted. Super fun game!!!
B0086700CM|1.0|1. A bunch of the reviews are FAKE!!!<br />2. The game is STUPID!!!!<br />3. This game is so OLD!!<br />4.This game is so BORING!!!!<br /><br />DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS APP!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Is this book well written?  No.  Is it complex and full of clever twists and turns?  No.  Is it like crack:  no nutritional value, but you crave it once you have a little bit?  YES!  The intense sex is mind-blowing and ever present, but it's the characters that get you addicted, especially Christian Grey.  You will fall completely in love with him.<br /><br />The only negative that actually bothered me (because it's easy to let the other negatives slide) was that this is not really a series of three books;  rather, it's a very long book divided into three volumes at almost random places.  If you read all three right in a row without a break, then it's a terrific summer read, but if you think you can read each book as a stand alone, then you will be annoyed.<br /><br />That being said, I really, really enjoyed the Fifty Shades of Grey books, and I know everyone else who reads it will enjoy it, too.  Laters, baby!
1400064287|5.0|It is among the best books I have already read in my life! Chip/Dan Heath show invaluable tools for the ones who want to persuade others on a non-manipulative manner. A must-read for every communicator.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's very handy. I use it at the store at home even at work. I would recommend it to everyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I ordered this on my kindle, so naturally, the service was immediate and the book was very good. You can't really mess up a kindle order though haha.
0143119680|5.0|The only con I have is that it started a little slow.  I listened to the unabridged audio version on my iphone and I found myself wanting to fast forward a little, though I didn't.  By chapter 2, I was hooked like a fish, and I walked around with my headphones in my ears for days listening to this wonderful story.  It made me smile, and laugh, and had intriguing information about history.  This is a more mature version of Twilight.  I would recommend this book to any of my friends, and I will definitely be reading the second book when it is released.  Oh, and using my iphone, I downloaded this from the music store for $5.99, so it's a really good deal for an audiobook!!  One last bit, the woman that reads it does a spectacular job of changing voices for each character and giving them true substance and personality.  She's done a great job telling the story!
0812971825|5.0|Elizabeth Strout's \\"Abide with Me\\" is set in the 1950s in a tiny town on the coast of Maine where an enthusiastic new minister, Tyler Caskey, suffers a calamitous loss.<br /><br />After the event, his five-year-old daughter withdraws into silence, Caskey goes through the motions of ministering but retreats into social and spiritual isolation, and his parishioners - viewing his numbness through the lens of their own insecurities and sorrows - badly misinterpret his behavior. The resolution comes in a defeat that proves to be the means of grace both for Caskey and his church community.<br /><br />Strout has a gift for imagining the inner lives of people so ordinary that few writers would find them interesting, for revealing their characters through telling detail and for using language that makes the everyday luminous.

014017821X|5.0|Angela Carter is a genius!  These short stories are woven magically with dark dramaticism and enticing sensuality.  The last three stories (\\"The Werewolf\\", \\"The Company of Wolves\\", and \\"Wolf-Alice\\") were my favorites by far.  These stories are more than new spins on old fairy tales; rather, they are psychological horror shows that delve into the sexual id of the human psyche.  There is a lot between the lines concerning feminine coming-to-power, which as a feminist I loved!  All in all, fantastic read and fabulous writing!
B005OK722U|2.0|I slightly enjoyed Hostel and Hostel: Part 2, so I was somewhat excited to see Hostel: Part 3. It's basically the same story as the original two, but this one changes the environment to Las Vegas and adds betting into the equation of the Elite Hunting organization. Changing the formula seemed like a great idea, but it ultimately fails in every other department.<br /><br />What did I like? Some of the kills were original and innovative. The Vegas environment was also a somewhat welcomed change. It had some tense scenes.<br /><br />What didn't I like? Hostel: Part 3 has some very weak effects which hurt the overall tone of the film; for example, the roach scene looked promising but actually sucked due to the effects. Also, although I enjoyed the Vegas setting, I feel like it took away from the fear of backpacking across a foreign country and getting abducted while doing so. The acting was weak from some characters, and I didn't like the ending. It wasn't as scary or tense as I expected, either. Also, for an unrated, straight-to-DVD film, you'd expect it to push the boundaries or try something new, but it doesn't<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie? No, I was disappointed and I'm not even a big fan of the series. The movie fails more than it succeeds. If you must watch this, it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/25/12 and I recommend you check it out there instead of paying full price for it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Thank you so much for shipping it fast my husband was impressed with you guys! The movie was great too although some of the characters are weird... The movie is full of good moral lesson. I would recommend this to all the parents and teachers to watch this movie with their children.
B002JVWRAO|3.0|While I think the show boasts some of the most literate writing on TV, it does have some huge logical flaws.<br />One of the shows major premises involves the necessity of burning the bones of a \\"ghost\\" in order to facilitate its passing to \\"the next world.\\" This usually involves many scenes of Sam & Dean dousing corpses with gas & igniting them. There's only one problem with this, you can't burn up bones with gasoline. Gasoline doesn't burn hot enough or long enough. Even crematoriums, whose fires burn in excess of 2500 degrees, can't turn bones into ash. A final hammering is often necessary.<br /><br />The other flaw involves our fearless heroes and their buff actor bodies which they magically maintain while spending long hours on the road eating diner food. Ever see a truck driver? Ever see a buff truck driver? Now you see my point.<br /><br />Once you get past these design errors, the show can be entertaining. The 2 stars are quite good at conveying horror, but they are equally adept at physical comedy.<br /><br />Overall, you could spend your time in worse ways than hanging out with the Winchester brothers.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|El Cid is great entertainment, with talented acting, story and sets.  Very enjoyment and I highly recommend it.  Thank you very much for making it available.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a fine example of the hidden object genre. The game provides a bit of a back story that is pleasant . However the mechanics of clicking through the back story is rather annoying. It is this annoyance that keeps the game from getting a 5 star rating.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|So far its a lot of fun and hasn't asked me to pay more to get to higher levels like some games like this.
0345803485|1.0|I am a major bookworm that reads everything, but I feel like I had to choke down this trilogy. I never return a book, but I made sure these were returned with a refund. If you're into a book with a weak story line, but plenty of kinky sex, this is the book for you. Now, I love a trashy romance as well as any woman, but I found myself skipping pretty much every other page because of yet another sex scene. It feels like the author wanted to make a strong love story, but gave up and opted for lots of sex and rushing the relationships between the characters instead. I started out liking Ana and Christian, but by the end, I wanted to reach into the books and throttle them both, NOT what you want to do with the main characters. I think if the sex was more spaced out, and the 'love story' made a bit stronger, it would have been much palatable to me. Within a space of a couple weeks, a virgin girl who wears jeans and converse, and owns one skirt ends up being 'kept' by a wealthy man who has an interesting taste in sex, is wearing designer clothes and heels like she was born in them and actually pouts when he didnt buy her another Audi. whaaat? Alternate personalities, maybe? Most heroines in stories dont change quite so fast.
B000002J1U|4.0|In fairness, I am not writing this review about the remastered version (I have a tendency to avoid remasters due to the ongoing loudness war, so my review is based upon the original CD release). I don't really discuss the sonic attributes of the record in this review (more the aesthetic), but it's safe and fair (I think) to say that the overall fidelity isn't that great - not bad mind you, just limited by some of the technology available in those days. Havings aid that I should also mention that the review that follows was originally written (by me) and posted on my local library's website.<br /><br />Here's the review:<br /><br />Having unleashed Led Zeppelin I and II just months earlier (both being monster blues-rock releases that sold wildly), it was unavoidable that comparisons would be made between Led Zeppelin III and its predecessors. However, III is about as far from its predecessors as it is from Led Zeppelin IV, and yet, it stands on its own merits. Much of this record is folk-driven, but there are some great rockers (\\"Out On the Tiles\\" being one) as well as one blues-based ballad that, despite not being as well known as \\"Going To California\\" (from IV) is one of the best blues ballads Zeppelin (or any rock band for that matter) have recorded - that track is \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". Frankly, it's brilliant.<br /><br />There are other classics to be found here as well - \\"Immigrant Song\\" and \\"Celebration Day\\", bioth of which are solid rock numbers. By contrast, \\"That's the Way\\" found its way onto the soundtrack of Cameron Crowe's film \\"Almost Famous\\" - it's a gentle, melodic, and heartfelt piece. Here again we see one of the things that I found most appealing about Zeppelin - they could rock...and yes, it could escalate to full-on bombast, but unlike a great many other bands, they could also make the quieter tracks (both musically and in terms of volume) work. Page and Plant had a really good grasp of the concept that contrast allows tracks to be seen (heard really) with some context and a basis for comparison.<br /><br />I don't think I can honestly call this Zeppelin's finest work - there's plenty of material against which this record can be compared, and ultimately, when measured against can fall a bit short of some of their other high water marks. Still, it is a very listenable record start to finish, and it serves as a document to where Zeppelin had been (musically), and where they were (possibly) going.<br /><br />I will say this though...this is one record that is worth having if for no other reason than to be able to hear \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". Zeppelin played this track many time during their live shows (and really never played it the same way twice), and this version (studio) features some great guitar solos as only Page can play 'em (somewhat sloppy, but replete with feeling and passion).<br /><br />Buy this album. You won't be disappointed

B00000DOYH|5.0|OK, so I pretty much copied this review (which I wrote for my local library) and pasted it here as-is. Let me say now that I am not a Zeppelin 'expert', and much of what I have written about certain tracks on this record were informed by things I had read in books, blogs, or sanctioned cites. Having said that, here's my review of what I consider to be one of the finest rock releases of all time, and what I personally consider to be my favorite Led Zeppelin record (yes, I'm a fan...and have been since my early teen years). Here goes...<br /><br />This album is somewhat of an enigma. In many ways, this release is full-on Zeppelin, and yet, in other ways, it really is quite different than what had come before. There's a great Rolling Stone article about the making of this record, and it gives some great insight into the dynamics going on between the band members (for example, their bassist, John Paul Jones, was in-crisis and seriously contemplating quitting the band right around this time), but also, between them and the recording engineer(s) who worked on this project. I mention that only because it does help epxlain and inform the band's direction during these recording sessions.<br /><br />As for the sessions, it's important to remember that several of the tracks were actually recorded for other Zeppelin records, but for whatever reason were not included in those releases. This is why, for example you will find \\"Houses of the Holy\\" on this record and not on the record released under the same name. That's but one example as there are several 'left'overs' that ended up on this record. Eight tracks were recorded at Headley Grange (if you ever wondered how Zeppelin got that \\"fat\\" drum sound on \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" on Zeppelin IV, it was there, in the (huge) foyer of Headley Grange that Bonham's drum kit was situated to take advantage of the low echo but lengthy reverb present in the space (remember...these were the pre \\"Pro Tools\\" days)), but among the tracks that were from other sessions (and included in 'Graffiti) were classics like Bron-Yr-Aur (pronounced \\"Brahn-rahr\\"), which is a beautiful in-the-round type mix that features Page alone, playing in an alternate tuning (I think open C...maybe?), recorded back in 1970.<br /><br />Some of the other out-takes from previous sessions (included on 'Graffiti) were \\"Night Flight\\", \\"Boogie with Stu\\" (an homage to Richie Valens' \\"Ooh, My Head\\" and so named because it featured Ian Stewart on a rather out-of-tune piano), and \\"Down By the Seaside\\", all three of which were recorded during the sessions for Led Zeppelin IV (and you know that one...don't you?). There are still other out-takes that were included, but the thing about this record is that much like the Stone \\"Exile on Main Street\\" it works both on the merits of individual tracks, as well as complete release; the context borne of all tracks frames the others.<br /><br />Indeed, the record was not originally conceived as the double-LP that it was ultimately issed as - this stemmed from the fact that the original eight tracks would be too long for a single record...and yet, there wasn't enough material to warrant a double-LP...until they decided to go back to the vaults and find suitable tracks, previously recorded, that would fit the overall musical theme and stylings of the record. However, it all sort of worked out. I suppose you could criticize the effort by saying that not all of the tracks were played with the completed project in mind and therefore, its merely a happy accident that it turned out as well as it did. That may indeed be the case, but it doesn't in any way detract from my enjoyment of the record, and in fact, I'm forever grateful that Page Plant et al decided that including previously recorded tracks made the record 'work' and allowed all eight (original) tracks to be heard.<br /><br />There are some full-on rock anthems on this record (the record opens with \\"Custard Pie\\" ('talk about a great guitar solo...)), butalso, there are some beautiful, melodic, and often times bitterwseet tracks. A personal favorite of mine being the seldom heard \\"Ten Years Gone\\", which speaks to a critical moment in Robert Plant's life when faced with an ultimatum given by his then girlfriend (\\"it's music...or me...make a choice\\") he chose the former rather than the latter. It's a really great track, with nice dynamics (for rock music anyway), with some great riffs played by (Jimmy) Page - it's a rather unusual rock track in that it almost appears to be written in movements rather than the traditional rock / blues structure.<br /><br />You want \\"Full-Throttle\\"? OK then...queue-up \\"The Wanton Song\\" (Bonham's triplets on this are legendary - and check out the timbre that John Paul Jones managed to get from the bass on this track - I have no idea how it was done, but the bass sounds incredibly good), the previously mentioned \\"Custard Pie\\", \\"Trampled Under Foot\\", \\"The Rover\\"...<br /><br />Then there's \\"In My Time of Dying\\". Zeppelin were heavily influenced by American blues and gospel, and this influence (particularly) serves as the roots of this track. It's a tour-de-force in slide guitar, and Bonham's drumming on this is ...thunderous. Let's not forget \\"In the Light\\", which features John Paul Jones' work on synthesizer and Page's guitar, and is the PERFECT tune for dimming the lights, and simply listening; it's a somwhat spooky / haunting number that does wonders with dynamics and phrasing. Like \\"Ten Years Gone\\", this is another lengthy track, written in movements, and begins with a dark, somewhat haunting part comprising Page's bowing of an acoustic guitar, along with Jones' synthesizer; the track builds...releases...builds again...releases again. Brilliant.<br /><br />So much to say...and so hard to say it well...but in my opinion, this record is indeed a masterpiece. If you have not heard this CD, you really need to do so. Go ahead...add it to your request list. Now.

B000065LZE|5.0|As with my review of \\"Physical Graffiti\\" (my favorite Zeppelin release), pretty much all of what follows has been copied and pasted from my local library's website (where I wrote and submitted this review). So, having said that...here's my review.<br /><br />Although the word 'classic' is over-used these days, the word actually applies here. Much has been written about Led Zeppelin by many, but I do have to say that no rock music collection is complete without this record.<br /><br />For better or worse, this is the album that contains \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", a tune that just about every living person on the planet knows or has heard. However, that tune alone should not be a reason to try this record out, or to reject it either. The album is a very even release, that is, there are no tracks that were obviously added as 'filler' in order to have a sufficiently-long record.<br /><br />This record opens with \\"Black Dog\\", a brilliant rocker that has some real quirks to it (deliberately so). While I can't really describe this in accurate musical terms, all you need do is listen, and you will hear what I mean - there's 'jump' to the ryhtym that you first notice right around the 0:42 mark; rumor has it that this quirk was suggested by John Paul Jones (bass / keys) in order to render the tune one to which people could neither dance or 'groove'. He may have been right about the former, but make no mistake - this is one classic groove.<br /><br />Next up is \\"Rock and Roll\\", which apparently came to be as a consequence of a jam session in the studio when 'Zeppelin, working on a completely different track (\\"Four Sticks\\", also found on this release), were having issues working out that particular track...and as a tension-releaser, they started to jam on this 12-bar blues structure, and John Bonham (drums) started playing the intro to a Little Richard tune...with Page then coming up with the riff. Magic...and now it's truly a 'classic' tune...covered by scores of bands to this day.<br /><br />All of the tracks are 'hits' (not in the radio airplay sense per se) in the sense that none of them lack groove, emotion, or musicianship, and there are some great dynamics to this record. That's not to say the dynamic range on any of these tracks is great (it is after all, mostly rock music), but that the record moves from full-tilt rock (especially due to the first two tracks), and then throttles down the engines by going into \\"The Battle of Evermore\\", a mandolin-driven folk-meets-rock creation which also features a guest vocal by Sandy Denny (Fairport Convention).<br /><br />The placement of \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" works perfectly with the next track (\\"Stairway to Heaven\\") as 'Stairway starts in the same gentle manner in which 'Evermore moves; these are very complementary tunes. Say what you will about 'Stairway, but I still find it to be a great tune. Overplay, yes...way overplayed, but still, it's a great tune owing to its movement from what amounts to folk, and then slowly, but steadily progresses into a rock assault. Stairway really is an amalgam of styles, and one could argue that the first several minutes are anything but rock, but could far more aptly be described as \\"folk\\".<br /><br />Next up \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\". This one has a bit of a nod to the '60's and the various happenings that were taking place in major cities around the world. I find this tune to be a lot of fun and features some nice keys by John Paul Jones, but to be perfectly honest, I always felt this song needed to be played at a somewhat faster tempo than it is. Then again, my surname is neither Page or Plant...so I should probably just shut up about that.<br /><br />Then we have \\"Four Sticks\\". Wow...I have always loved John Bonham's drumming, and this track is but one example (in a long list) of why so many people (including myself) consider him to be the best rock drummer of all time. Like the segue between 'Evermore and 'Stairway, the segue between 'Hop and 'Sticks also works really well in terms of the record's 'pace'.<br /><br />Which brings us full circle to the quiet side of the band - \\"Going to California\\". This is a great number that, like many Zeppelin tracks, paints a picture for the listener of the things that the singer really wants (a full life, happiness, love, comfort, family) and how his willingnmess to 'make a new start' holds the promise of bringing these things to fruition. This is a very gentle ballad comprising only vocals (Plant) guitar, and mandolin (Page).<br /><br />And then ... the hammer drops. The record closes with \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". This track, like so many Zeppelin tracks, was recorded at Headley Grange. You have to love the natural reverb on the sound that Bonham gets from the drum kit (which was accomplished by situating the drum kit in the four-story foyer at headley Grange, with mics hung overhead, and Bonham playing the kit in that space - all natural reverb). As for the tune itself...this is classic Zeppelin in the sense that it's blues-driven (and features some great harmonica playing by Plant).<br /><br />Again...if you listen to rock music, chances are this is already in your collection...but if it's not...and if by chance you have not heard it (or are just new to Led Zeppelin) you really need to hear this record. Like I said at the start of this review, the word 'classic' is over-used, but in this case, it's an apt descriptor.<br /><br />Trust me - this one's a \\"Must Have\\".
B0001VULNE|1.0|Item arrived in box that is torn and damaged beyond reason, was poorly constructed, and a complete waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone for any reason.
B000002KP3|5.0|Where to start?<br /><br />I suppose that for many who have not heard of T.Rex, this album may take a bit of a listen to get used to - especially some of the less 'mainstream' tracks. Yes, it's on this release that you will find \\"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\\", but that's a track that one could consider as a bonus to the rest of the tracks, all of which are solid.<br /><br />Marc Bolan (frontman for said band) and David Bowie were friends and spent a fair amount of time hanging out; one could say that they were effectively cut from the same cloth (though Bolan's theatrical tastes were far bested by those of Bowie) and if you ever wondered where the genesis for Bowie's \\"The Rise and fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\\" you need look no further than this record (which predates TRAFOZSATSFM) by a year or so.<br /><br />I wouldn't in any way call this record a concept album (an assessment often made of Bowie's TRAFOZSATSFM) apart from the concept of Glam-rock having informed many of these tunes. Many of them are heavy on the mellotron (which was a short-lived but important keyboard instrument used on some other classics (the into to the Beatles \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" as but one...) and typical pseudo-stereo effects (also heavily used on TRAFOZSATSFM). Still, when you strip away the effects, the music is still solid.<br /><br />We open with \\"Mambo Sun\\", a driving bass and drum-led rocker that has a sort of laid back yet always moving rhythm; it remains one of my favorite rock tunes from this era. Some really nice guitar work here with at least one part (lead) being played through a distortion pedal - but played well...a really nice use of effects...<br /><br />This brings us to \\"Cosmic Dancer\\". Again, a very melodic tune / structure from which Bowie 'borrowed' heavily for TRAFOZSATSFM (on more than one tune) with some utterly bizarre lyrics - just look 'em up sometime and you'll see what I mean. Yet, there's a really nice string arrangement that seems to workreally well in this track...which takes us right up to...<br /><br />\\"Jeepster\\". From the soft, melodic structure of \\" 'Dancer\\" we jump right back into a simple (about as simple as you can get) 12-bar blues-based tune, with (yet again) bizarre lyrics...and yet once again, some great guitar work; Bolan does a nice job of syncopating parts of this track via anotehr distorted guitar riff; the use of slap-back echo also seems to suit this piece. All in all, an enjoyable and yet amusing (though I doubt deliberately so) tune. Also, Bolan's vocals are double-tracked on this and do well to help fatten the vocals out nicely.<br /><br />\\"Monolith\\" has much in common with \\" 'Dancer\\", especially musically...right down to the backing vocals and pseudo-stereo effects. Musically though, it's a nice slowly rocking piece...and yes...again...some obtuse lyrics.<br /><br />This brings us to \\"Lean Woman Blues\\", which is probably my favorite track on the record. Yes, \\"Get It On\\" is every bit the classic, but I just love the slow, sloppy feel to this - right on down to the guitar parts.<br /><br />Next up \\"Bang A Gong (Get It On)\\". I really, really love how this track begins - just a sparse bit of bass and guitar...maybe two bars' worth, and then the main riff starts. the mellotron featurtes heavily on this track as well (starting right around the 0:38 mark). I see this as the classic, quintessential glam rock track - and due to it's massive airplay world-wide, one of the more influential songs that pushed glam to the fore (albeit briefly).<br /><br />\\"Planet Queen\\" is very much like \\"Mambo Sun\\", though played in a slightly slower meter...and yes...Bolan's bizarre lyrics abound.<br /><br />Then we have \\"Girl\\". This is probably the most 'sparse' track on the record (the reverb on Bolan's vocals notwithstanding). This is pretty much driven by acoustic guitar, a distorted lead / fill guitar, and what sounds like a french horn. There are no drums or bass on this track, and given Bolan's sensibilities, this tune becomes a bizarre but very listenable track.<br /><br />\\"The Motivator\\". Great tune. This one bounces and features some great backing vocals (primarily Bolan's) and complements \\"Girl\\" in terms of its sparseness. It is not as orchestrated / produced as some of the other tracks on this record, but I think (for me anyway) it is what makes this tune 'work'. I also like how the congas carry the rhythm of this track.<br /><br />\\"I could have loved you girl, like a planet\\" ... yes...those are the introductory lyrics to the next track (\\"Life's a Gas\\")...again...congas are featured on this (as they were on \\"The Motivator\\", albeit not as forward in the mix). Like most tracks, the vocals fill nicely here due to them being double-tracked. There's also a cool, but brief guitar solo here... I felt like I had to quote at least some of the more unusual lyrics (though these songs are replete with such lyrics).<br /><br />The record closes with \\"Rip Off\\". In some ways, this almost seems to pre-date rap. When I say that I am referring only to the vocal phrasing, but this tune turns on the glam with its saxophone fills and orchestrated sound.<br /><br />All in all, this still remains one of my favorite rock records, but I think you have to categorize this one as glam (primarily) that has been informed by blues and rock as well. As I have mentioned before, the lyrics are, in some ways, laughable...but at the same time, they fit the songs. Indeed, I find this album to be the quintessential 'period piece'of that short-lived but very influential period when glam held sway.

I must admit, The Forever Girl is not my usual read, but I was given the chance to check it out. Through her remarkable writing style, Rebecca Hamilton ease the readers through the chapters, and navigates them through an unfolding  storyline filled with rich characters, adventure, romance, humor, and not to mention a kick-ass heroine.<br /><br />As a reader who is not that familiar with urban fantasy/paranormal territory, I found Hamilton's writing to be a great guide to the world of Wiccan, witches, and vampires. I was so intrigued by the character Sophia's background that I find myself wanting to do more reading and research about the Salem witch trials. And to me, that is what great writing does - open one's mind to explore more knowledge and other possibilities.

B005LAIHYU|1.0|There are many instances in literature and film where a famous person is placed into a fictitious setting and one of the key componants to the entertainment value of such a proceeding is the audience's anticipated ability to imagine alternative or hidden histories related to whatever historical characters are being utilized.  A recent cinematic example is THE RAVEN where the historically mysterious last weeks in Poe's life are the springboard for the speculative.  Many years ago there was a very fine film called TIME AFTER TIME that raised the question \\"What if H.G. Wells had not only written of the Time Machine, but had invented one as well?\\" The film then built upon this notion and the resultant movie - which also included Jack the Ripper being transported to the future, our present - was extremely well done, exciting, entertaining and even thought-provoking. There was also a Sherlock Holmes movie - THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION - wherein Sigmund Freud is called in by Dr. Watson to help with Holmes' cocaine addiction.  There are many, many examples wherein historical figures are intertwined and interjected into fictional settings - and very often the results are fun, exciting, interesting, thought-provoking.  The truly crucial element in all cases where this artistic hybrid proves successful to one degree or another is winning the audience's ability to at least be able to say \\"It could have happened.\\"  So, in the examples above, had Holmes been a historical figure, Freud could have crossed paths with him.  Poe, in his last unknown weeks, could have - no matter how absurd and unlikely - been involved in a serial murder case as shown in THE RAVEN.  And even though it is logically absurd, imaginatively the thought of H.G. Wells and a real Time Machine is truly delightful to contemplate.<br /><br />But with ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER, what would have worked better as a five minute Saturday Night Live sketch, comes at us like this same flick's Lincoln's silver-tipped axe - cutting, chopping, killing everything in its path.  For starters, it cuts and chops and kills any entertainment value it ever might have had by sheer and simple overkill. And not just the overkill of the vampires and their victims: I mean yawn-inducing horse stampedes and ridiculous runaway trains that just never know when to quit!  And isn't it enough to take arguably the most famous figure in American history and make him into a vampire hunter?  Do the makers of this undisciplined train-wreck of a movie have to make him into a cartoon superhero too?  No man on the planet ever did or ever could leap and fly around in the silly horse stampede sequence or survive one one-hundreth of the physical extremes of the never ending train-wreck episode.  Only cartoon super heroes are capable of such gravity-defying, injury-immune acrobatics. Or should be. Superman or Spiderman - but not Honest Abe! (If Lincoln is able to leap tall buildings with a single bound, what is left for the Man from Krypton?) To watch and endure such sequences as mentioned above does a vast injustice to the heroic abilities of the truly human - and are an insult to the intelligence unless one is immune to or addicted to or financially enslaved to the Monster that is undisciplined, indiscreet, infantile CGI. This true Movie Monster has been stomping around for a long time now, crushing otherwise great and good actors in its path, stealing most things subtle and replacing it with the senseless spectacular - and the sounds and musical soundtracks that accompany these domineering digital depravities have mostly obliterated script literacy entirely.  Where is a silver axe to destroy this true Monster of the Movies?<br /><br />But there is a larger issue at work here other than the misuse of CGI.  Does this allegedly \\"fun\\" film give early hint of a dangerous proclivity?  History is or should be important.  In a country where very few school kids (or even college kids!)(or even anybody!) even know whoAbraham Lincoln is or, worse, even cares about why he is so historically great and enduring, along comes a movie that with its pandering to the current spike in the never-ending fascination with the undead and its catering to every conceivable cliche in the book when it comes to CGI-driven  and bloated actioneers, along comes a movie that takes the most painful pages from American history and spatters them not with the blood of men but with the blood of vampires.  So we see on screen an Abraham Lincoln who becomes President - not to keep the States United or end the much more insidious evil of slavery - no, this Lincoln's agenda is to defeat the vampire hordes who come to populate much of the South and by proxy the Confederate Army.  And the tide is turned at Gettysburg not by the sheer belief and bravery of the Union Army, but by plundered Southern silver being fired by rifle and cannon into the undead Rebels peopling Robert E. Lee's army.  And Lincoln's son Willie dies not of the truly tragic Potomac fever, but from a vampire's bite.  The point is that history is overwhelmingly trivialized in this silly, simplistic film.  It is one thing to speculate about hidden histories or might-have-beens in an artisic undertaking.  But when the history - as with Lincoln and the Civil War and Slavery - is virtually impossible to ever have been hidden and the might-have-beens have not the slightest semblance of sanity to back them, then the speculative work will suffer from a severe and deadly artistic anemia that has naught to do with the attack of a vampire.  The true vampires in this entire instance are the makers of this movie who suck blood and brain and bucks from the unsuspecting masses glutting on bread and circuses as Rome burns and Nero fiddles.<br /><br />I can envision an ever darker, bleaker, scarier by-far future in film when some irresponsible and twisted film makers who just so happen to have an unlearned, unread, uncaring fan-based mandate might cook up a film wherein Hitler is also a vampire hunter and the Holocaust is nothing less than a purging of Europe's living dead hordes.<br /><br />In short, to trivialize history is to trivialize humanity - and once that is acceptable by mass consensus...then anything, anything at all, could happen.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|What a nice surprise this album is. I had not planned to buy this until I read an article in Rolling Stone about the BB reunion. I have loved Brian Wilson's work since I heard my first BB song in the mid 60's. Pet Sounds is one of my top 3 albums ever and I consider \\"Good Vibrations\\" a rock masterpiece. This is not \\"Pet Sounds\\" or \\"Good Vibrations\\" but it is a damn good album. From the sweet opening chords of \\"Think about the Days\\" to the closing, melancholy strands of \\"Summers Gone\\" this album produces solid song after solid song. Brian Wilson is one of the true musical genuises of the last 50 years and when he is writing for Mike Love's voice something special happens. This is an outstanding recording!!

0545265355|5.0|I wasn't sure about this series because it was so popular I thought it may be lacking in content, but I was wrong, it was amazing, well written, and had a good plot line along with the love story. Now I just need to find something else that will capture my attention span like it.

B005LAIHQS|4.0|I grew up with Men in Black, the first one was pretty original and just a fun time overall before Will Smith got old and predictable, while the second one also helped me grow up with learning about bitter disappointment, so almost ten years later another Men in Black would be interesting, and while I think most people forgot about this series until the third one was announced, the time did it well to give the writers time to make another one. Well here it is, Men in Black 3, and I'd say it's as good as the first one but it doesn't have the advantage of being the first one so it doesn't feel as fresh and original as the first one, oh well.<br /><br />In this one a convict that Agent K put away has gotten a hold of a time machine (more of a device actually) and goes back in time to kill K before he stops the guy, and J (Will Smith) goes back to the shagadelic 60's to stop him from killing K. When I first heard about this it seemed like a ploy so Tommy Lee Jones wouldn't have to get his old cranky ass onto the movie set every day, but he's still in the movie enough for it to work and game enough to do an action scene, go Tommy. So while the plot's a pretty cool new way to show MIB the back in time thing kind of reminded me of the 2nd one where they had to take stuff from the past for the plot, this one fully devotes to the past.<br /><br />So what's good about MIB taking place in the past, well there's an abundance of alien jokes to make about the 60's and they hit a few good ones but not enough to make it a flat out comedy (like they did with the 2nd), the villain in the 60's had a Dustin Hoffman Easy Rider-era vibe to him, the racism card was played in perfect doses, and the Andy Warhol bit was a golden oppurtunity they hit perfectly. Other great moments were seeing the gadgets the MIB used in the 60's, especially the giant neurolizer tube got a chuckle out of me.<br /><br />If there was a disappointing aspect about MIB 3 though I'd say it was the action, it felt kinda forced at times and I didn't really feel any tension or anything, even when they're like 100ft in the air the tension was just gone, and in the opening at the Asian restuarant it felt like they had to show J shoot a few bad aliens, maybe as a little reminder to the audience that yes, this is in fact a MIB film. But in true MIB style they kept the action light with jokes peppered in, so really it was no big thing chicken wing.<br /><br />Josh Brolin was great as a young K, he brought a whole new aspect to the character, showing him a little (very little) less serious and enjoyed his job with a rat-pack vibe to him. He was entertaining enough to carry the movie but not enough to outshine Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />Probably my favorite aspect about MIB 3 though was the new villain, he was x1000 times better than 'tentacle rape woman' or whatever from the second one, and just about as creepy as the cockroach in human skin in the first one. In the opening scene (before the Asian restuarant shoot out) he breaks out of prison, all the while delivering gloriously cheesy and over the top one-liners, and his name was Boris! He was straight out of the 60's batman show, they could've had him more in the movie but that might've taken away his charm.<br /><br />Anyways what else is there really to say about MIB 3? It was a fun time at the movies, delivered the goods and the aliens were unique and interesting, the story was good and had a small emotional punch at the end, and it was a hell of a lot better than the 2nd one.  So in the decade of randomly revived movie series Men in Black 3 was refreshingly well done and back to the formula which made it work well in the first place.da forced at times and I didn't really feel any tension or anything, even when they're like 100ft in the air the tension was just gone, and in the opening at the Asian restuarant it felt like they had to show J shoot a few bad aliens, maybe as a little reminder to the audience that yes, this is in fact a MIB film.

B004T2QZL8|3.0|really fun but really frustrating it takes forever to get all the elements believe me I got them all in a month and that was from constant playing.its kindof in inipropate but u can turn that off.otherwise its an ok game :)
B005LAIGN2|5.0|The movie was great and George Lucas is to be commended for taking the risk on his own. It was personal to me because I know a lot of the remaining Tuskegee Airmen and one (Lt. Col. Alexander Jefferson) was one of our (me, my sisters and brothers) teachers in elementary school. He was credited as a consultant and featured in the extras on the DVD. Mr. Jefferson invited as many of his elementary school students as he could locate to his 90th birthday party last November. It was fantastic. The DVD was high quality and although a little heavy on the silly humor at times, it gives a different and daring viewpoint than other movies on the TA's.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like the game helps to pass time. the only thing I wish was you never ran out of energy.
0307946711|4.0|Not quite the instant classic that some people think. Nevertheless, a funny and deeply moving love story charting the lives of two friends over twenty years. The central concept of revisiting them on St Swithian's day is clever, the characterisation is great. There are also plenty of funny lines to keep you laughing and literary references so your brain gets a work out! (SPOLIER ALERT) I found the ending so shocking / surprising that I had to read it half a dozen times before it fully sunk in. I still haven't forgiven Mr Nicholls for ending it that way!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it took me forever to unlock games put once I did it was worth it. I love this app. it is pretty cool.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|It's wrong to review just one season of this show when it's the previous build-up that makes this season so great. Every nerve-wracking scenario you can think of (and not) comes to a head in these episodes. Secondary characters begin to play a major part and, in light of Walt's increasing loss of control, they almost outshine the main character's genius. I won't repeat what others have rightly said about the complexity of the plot and character development - every compliment is deserved.<br /><br />I would, however, like to add that the soundtrack is incredible. Not only the music provided by Dave Porter is eerie and unnerving (particularly at the end of \\"Crawl Space\\"), but also the \\"random\\" mix of old and newer hits give Breaking Bad that cherry on top. In truth, nothing is random about the songs - I downloaded a lot of them (lists of songs used in respective episodes are available online, as the official soundtrack only contains some songs from seasons 1 & 2). I was astounded how well the lyrics often fit to the story unfolding; you'd think they were written specifically for BB, the way \\"Negro Y Azul\\" was. Examples include \\"Who's Gonna Save My Soul\\" by Gnarls Barkley or \\"Catch Yer Own Train\\" by The Silver Seas, though Ana Tijoux, Holy F*** and the many reggae greats make it such an all-rounder that I watch for the plot as much as for the new musical inspiration. (the songs I refer to are not just from season 4)<br />An absolute A+++ show! And totally re-watchable - I've gotten several people hooked and watch along with them whenever possible. It has yet to be dull!
1451648537|5.0|This is a powerful book that highlights the remarkable achievements of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />It is a joy to read; it is both entertaining and informative.<br /><br />Anyone interested in building brands should read this book. Apple is one of the world's great brands and its success is largely due to the efforts of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />Importantly, the book doesn't shy away from covering Steve's strange habits and his bizarre approach to management. He was a great brand builder and an obsessed fanatic. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that he was a great brand builder in part because he was an obsessed fanatic.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love thrillers but find my \\"go to\\" authors like James Patterson concentrating on quantity vs. quality.  Gone Girl is SO well written.  Flynn has an amazing way of weaving this thriller between the narrative of both main characters.  If you like to stay guessing, this is the book for you. I became a bit obsessed and stayed up until 5am to finish it.  I didn't love the ending so I only give it four stars but it is an enthusiastic four stars!  I plan on reading more from Gillian Flynn.
B0059WTMLW|2.0|Interface not the best I've seen and used in other games. It's easy to write over your entry.  sorry, I rate this only two stars.
1932735410|5.0|We are using this book as part of preparation for the PMP exam for a program management division in SAAB. We do this as a study group on a weekly basis. The book is easy to read with lots of good advice for project managers and goes way beyond just exam prep. It stimulates  a lot of good discussion in the group. It is a brilliant resource for increasing the skill base of all involved. I highly recommend this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thus game is so fun on the kindle fire and its the best game ever, you will love it so you should at least try it
B0086700CM|4.0|simple, yet fun...I like it. seems like some of the updates have actually caused issues so 4 stars for now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I know many people have questioned the writing level of the Fifty Shades series but for me, I wanted to be able to escape into the romance of Christian and Ana, not worry if I needed to have a thesaurus close by!  I utterly loved the books - read the whole series in 1-1/2 wks which is record time for me.  They were totally engrossing.  I couldn't stop reading them.  Many nights I stayed up WAY past my usual bed time b/c I literally could not put them down.  I even got my husband to read them and have started book 1 again.  They were exactly what I wanted them to be - great escapism thru the written word.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book had some interesting ideas, but I wish more of them were flushed out.  It was a quick, easy read that was enjoyable.  I plan to read the other two and I hope the author continues developing the social and political tension started in this book.
140053271X|5.0|The Nook simple touch had made me a fan of reading. I used to be on and off before but never consistent. The fact that it comes with a 2G hard drive and then a micro SD slot makes it easy to start a large library. The weight of it is real light and very easy to use and navigate through. Nothing fancy it just read books and if you got Wifi you can go to the store and look at the endless collection B&N has.
B0081L391C|5.0|OMG this money was so funny. Their faces and reactions to things and their bosses was to much. I couldn't stop laughing. Anytime a movie can make you keep laughing that's a good thing. I love seeing Johnny Depp and Holly Robinson make appearances because as we all know they were the main actors on TV 21 Jump Street. Overall this movie was funny, good acting and a good mood movie. I Love it! I hope there is a second one where they go uncover in College. Would love to see a remake TV show of 21 Jump Street.

B0086700CM|5.0|I am addicted, this game is awesome on Kindle Fire. Works flawlessly for me,  can't put it down. And I am not usually a fan of this type of game.  :-)
0345803493|5.0|It's darker Grey because you are learning more about the characters lives. This book isn't as steamy as the first because it is focusing more on the characters, their backgrounds, their futures. It's still steamy for those that want that.  It's just nice to know that there is an actual plot to the story and that it has a purpose beyond fantasy. I threw out the family and finished the book in a day.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this on Android devices finally, so glad it's finally on the Amazon Appstore now. runs super on tablet and Kindle Fire
B007OWG3LM|4.0|As a fan of Sigur Ros since the late '90s, it's amazing to see the band's musical evolution over these 12+ years. It was no surprise to see that the band called \\"musical time-out\\" after their 2008 album and tour. Now 4 years later, an eternity in today's cultural landscape, finally comes the band's 6 th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Valtari\\" (8 tracks; 545 min.) starts off gently with \\"Eg Anda\\", and it isn't only until several inutes into the song that we get Jonsi's \\"hopelandic\\" vocals. The best track on here for me is track 3, a monumental \\"Varuo\\", which builds up and builds up until you feel it's going to explode but then doesn't and simp[ly fades out with piano. The first hald concludes with an interesting \\"Rembinutur\\". The second half of the album is even more abstract, and also restrained. Interestingly, after \\"Dauoalogn\\" it is entirely instrumental at this point, without singing from Jonsi, which in the ends marks a significant difference from earlier albums. When the album is over, you have the feeling that it's not quite over yet, that the exclamation point on the album is missing, but that's just me.<br /><br />While this is certainly not a bad album, it also is not on par with their best work (that would be \\"( )\\" for me). The first time I saw Sigur Ros in concert was in 2001, and I've had the good fortune of seeing them again fairly regularly since then until they went on hiatus in 2008. I hope I'll get a chance to see these guys in concert again, as their live performances almost invariably are better than their studio output.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I got the trilogy for my Kindle.  Read all the reviews before hand, so had some idea what was to be expected.  It was an enjoyable, quick, easy read.  There was so much hype about it being provocative...IMHO, not so much.  I fully enjoyed the read and finished the complete trilogy over the weekend.  It was completely entertaining.  Well written...not really, but then again I wasn't looking for something technical.
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|I am just not getting Fiona Apple these days. I remember when the AMC Theatre opened in Pineville in '96, I was walking across the parking lot and heard a voice (AMC plays music in the lobby and outside the theater) I have never heard before. Luckily, the artists' names are always announced. The song was Shadowboxer and I had never heard anything like it. I bought the CD that day and immediately loved it. 6 great singles were released and she won a Grammy for one of them (Criminal). It's still probably one of my ten favorite albums or all time by a female artist. The following two were nowhere nearly as good as the first.<br /><br />I bought the new CD last week and it's, to me, pretty \\"unlistenable\\" after about 7 listens.  I don't know what she's thinking. Her voice screeches and wavers like she's lost control. I do not like her vocals at all on this! The Jazz-ish back-up band sounds most the time like they are playing something else, somewhere else. I'm sure critics probably love it since it's so \\"Yoko Ono out there\\". Stylistically, I'd call it free jazz or impromptu jazz, if there is such a thing. Each of her CD's has sold fewer copies than it's predecessor and I'm feeling that the trend will continue with this release. I fully realize she is not drawn into pop trends and stardom, but she needs to do something to keep her longtime fans ...and her recording contract.<br /><br />I bought the deluxe version with her artwork and lyrics and a bonus DVD. I like her art fine. It's the only thing that doesn't make this 13 bucks a waste of my money.<br /><br />Fiona Apple's The Idler Wheel... (Yes, another pretentiously long album title from her): The Deluxe CD/DVD packaging with great art and interesting lyrics...I'd give it an A-, the music and vocals...I'd give it a D. I don't really hate the music, I'm just disappointed in it. I don't get it. I don't see myself ever singing along with any of the tracks...and I've tried.<br /><br />More importantly, Fiona comes out ofmy truck tomorrow and the new Garbage, Not Your Kind of People, goes back in!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Great movie and a love affair to Burrough's Source material. After reading some of the Mars series, read a few Tarzans,<br />his stories are sometimes very dark and violent with lots of killing; not the lovable characters from Disney and other movies!<br />Great stuff!
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Take a top notch director, several Academy Award winning actors, a script from the discard bin at the SyFy channel and a couple hundred million dollars - and this is what you get.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!<br /><br />There is no logical motivation for the basis of the storyline.  It's all a bunch of nonsense that provides no purpose.<br /><br />The previews of this film with its horrifying soundtrack made this film look like the must-see film of the year! Too bad the previews were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />Oh I can see where the money was spent - it's a big involved production and they've got some really great talent wondering what the heck they're doing in this lousy film.  I'm sure the producers had to pay the actors more when the actors realized what a horrible film this was.<br /><br />Why is Charlize Theron - arguably one of the most beautiful women in the world - and an incredible actress - ....why is she only delivering a flat \\"angry\\" performance? No range. Terrible.<br /><br />Guy Pearce - why bother hiring this fine actor if you're going to cover him up in some of the poorest old age make-up I've seen this side of a high school play?  He's completely wasted - but then so is the whole storyline involving him.<br /><br />Is there any reason that \\"humanoid\\" beings populated the Earth and finding them so Pearce's character can find immortality?<br /><br />The plot line is paper thin and very juvenile compared to the original Alien and its first sequel Aliens. The characters are so poorly drawn that you really don't care whether anyone lives or dies.  When they do start dying, I began rooting for the aliens because the humans were all so pathetic and uninteresting.<br /><br />If we don't know who these humanoid beings are, then why in the \\"universe\\" would we assume that they can grant immortality?  Where's the logic?<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />And what the heck is that humanoid drinking at the beginning of the film, whyis he doing it and why is he alone and what in the world does it have to do with anything?<br /><br />This film would have been ever so much better if they'd just maintained the original premise of the film and allowed the crashed ship to have been another alien race that had succumbed to the Aliens.<br /><br />WOW - what a stinker!
B00881VLCE|4.0|all of the fun of doing jigsaw puzzles without all the mess and missing pieces. wish they had more free puzzles but the prices are reasonable.
B004LWZW4W|2.0|I'm not sure what was more of a disappointment in this film -- the people, or the apes. On the one hand, the people behaved nonsensically, with James Franco demanding that his drug be rushed into human testing on the basis of success in one test animal, to his boss ordering all the test animals killed when one acts aggressively, to the manager in their business responsible for the chimps who never notices that one of them is pregnant and gives birth and has a baby in her cage until after she dies. Are you kidding me? Then, later in the film, James Franco and his boss change views, with the boss insisting on immediate expansion of testing and Franco saying no, for no reason the audience will even know.<br /><br />Then there are the chimps, who are animated at a level only modestly better than 1981 video game \\"donkey kong\\". At no time do we feel any tension over their fate; they are too clearly fake. When a group of them become super-smart thanks to the application of James Franco's wonder-drug, and escape a bizarre government sanctuary for chimps, they multiply at least 20x on their way to free other chimps at Franco's lab and the zoo (the chimps from which become magically super-smart themselves, though they never were even exposed to the wonder-drug).<br /><br />Twice in the film, one of the wonder-chimps speaks in English. Presumably the brain-enhancing drug also makes his vocal cords more human in their structure. This goes undiscussed on screen.<br /><br />There is one excellent, Speilberg-esque scene of suburbanites marveling as leaves rain down on their cars, shaken loose by the horde of apes traveling through the treetops above. We get various cute callouts to the original films (the launch and loss of the spacecraft from which the returning astronauts will come, Charlton Heston on TV, \\"get your hands off me, your d*mn dirty apes,\\" etc.) This is sort of cute but can't address the structural problems with the film.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Although I'm still reading it, I find the story told in this book quite amusing. After each chapter I'm eager to get to the next one. Great title for this small price!<br /><br />-- EDIT --<br />July 7, 2012<br /><br />After reading the book in its entirety I'm confident to say it's worth more than $2.99, that's for sure.<br /><br />Kindle Edition has it's flaws, like more than obvious spelling mistakes at the beginning which were fading away as the story progressed, and there's no way I'd give it a 5-star review based only on that fact. However, the story is amazing and unique and characters are well-developed. Reading chapters one after another gives a feeling of actually knowing main characters in person and being next to them in the story.<br /><br />So in the end that's 4 stars for Kindle Edition and 5 stars for a great story. Overall it's still a 5-star rating.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Great season and it leaves you excited for the seventh season but the ending of the last disk. Bloopers are very funny.

6305268177|5.0|After the passing of Robin Gibbs, I remembered seeing and admiring a concert I saw on TV years back. Little did I know that it had been made into a DVD, but I knew that, if such thing existed, I could find it on Amazon.com and I did. I love the style of the Bee Gees and I love Robin's demeanor while performing...so cool!<br />I love the group, especially the Saturday Nigh Fever soundtrack! I ordered this DVD and have enjoyed ALL of the songs listed. It arrived in half the time I thought it would take, which impressed me even the more! Shirley

B007MNV5WU|5.0|very fun game. all new way to play angry birds. the only thing I don't like about it is it's way to short and it needs an update. but sooner or later it will come and this is the only reason I gave it a 5 star rating and not a 3 or 4 star rating
B00000099Y|5.0|Because of the worthless skits/filler tracks.  Yes I would give it six stars if that were allowed and there were no silly skits and filler.  This, to me, is one of the greatest albums ever made, by the greatest band ever...to me.  I don't like Tool because they are \\"smart\\", \\"witty\\" or \\"pretentious\\" or whatever the people who don't like them want to label the band.  I just like them because the music is candy for my ears.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I like games like these. I could do without the mini game. Dialogue drags alittle but overall a very good game
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|One Direction is nothing but an average boy band covered up with crappy processed music along with vocals that aren't anything new. This album may appeal to 13 year old girls who think they have a chance to marry one of these kids, but no one else. Their music isn't anything spectacular. In fact, it's basically what our cousin's were listening to in the early 2000's with NSync and Backstreet Boys. Give or take another album or two and everyone will forget about these kids.

B000N3T0DW|5.0|This film is, to say the least, a little weird. Almod&oacute;var is know for strange films, from what I understand, this is my first viewing of one of his films, but I've read as much.  In any case, though Penelope Cruz is clothed throughout, she's still stunning.  I can see why Tom Cruise fell for her (but he doesn't do it for me).  That aside, it was a little hard to follow, at first, but I soon got into it. She hides a body, thinks her mother died, and is part of a trio of sisters who are very close.  She kills the guy for something creepy, but I won't say what it is [you have to watch the film].  They are a very affectionate lot, i.e., the women, always kissing each other when they meet (it must be \\"Spanish\\" thing).  Anyway, it is in Spanish (which I've forgotten a lot of, since school, so it's a good thing it has subtitles).  One problem, my disc did a little \\"skip\\", but it wasn't too big a thing, a minor bit at the beginning (no media is perfect).  She's really good (Cruz is) and the rest are too.  A nice film.
0071373586|5.0|In this book, the authors point out many of the flaws in the way that businesses approach the marketing of their products and services. They highlight the need for businesses to start with how consumers see their products and services and build from there, rather than assuming consumers will see things the way the company sees them. The authors also point out the importance of being first-to-market and that companies that are attempting to enter a market with an established leader should try to fill the needs of a niche market, rather than taking the market leader on head-to-head. This book was originally published in the 1980's, but it is still very relevant today.

Well , at least I did start to read this book.<br />The problem was it kept putting me to sleep.<br />I did enjoy Martin's first three books but its been a fast train wreck getting through book 4 and now 5.<br />The author is suffering from attention span deficit. And rambles on and on about the stupidest crap. Considering his deterioration and age this series will never be finished/rectified. I won't be indulging in his works any longer.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Fun game to play in rainy weather.graphics are great.thank you amazon for giving this app for free today.fighting with the kids for my kindle fire..this app good for all ages!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is so good I love it I went to gallery and got a pic and I made it look weird hahah buy this app
B0059WTMLW|3.0|It's a well laid out and well executed version of sudoku, but it has required an update 4 times in the span of a week which is somewhat annoying and hard to understand why it would need such constant updating.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could keep reading.  Hugh,  you will have more followers soon.  I am having our book club read Wool Omnibus for my pick.  Looking forward to more!  Great books.  You have some Indy fans.  Seriously could be made into an incredible movie if done right.  To everyone else,  very simple... Read these!  You won't be sorry.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book for me was well written. I could hardly wait to see what happened next.<br />I am so glad I bought it for my Kindle. I love how it was erotic, sexy and yet<br />romantic too.  Definately for your dreams, cause there is no way it could be like this for real...:) I read somewhere that it would be something you would never forget and whoever said that was right... I didn't want to finish it, but wanted to see what happened.  Will definately read it again in the future...
B002B79BVO|4.0|Well worth the purchase!  We would buy more seasons of this or any other show we are currently following.  Very handy while on the road; we watched on the lap top at night when travelling.  Good quality picture and streaming.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I enjoy this game. I have the free version too. It's a bit easy though.<br />I don't like the dialogues so I skip them all which is easy to do.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I am an avid reader and love it when a book and author that I haven't heard of end up becoming a favorite.  I read this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down.  The chemistry between the characters made it wonderful, I couldn't wait to see what would happen next...
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Entertaining wondering what is going to happen will they survive 2 games<br />And what will their life be like after another games will the nightmares be worse
B0063GORYU|5.0|awesome cool great gnarly freak out say it again play that funky game today or tomorrow it is up to you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thank that the fish game is good.it has alot of color. it may be the only game my kids would play
B002SSUQFG|5.0|got to me in perfect condition no problems at all.the trap when well with the watch the look is clean good for casual or dress up
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is challenging and addicting. The most fun you can have, playing a game by yourself. Adding different suits makes the challenge. Have fun.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I won't say that I'm a serious photographer - it is a camera on phone after all - but of all the apps for editing pics on the go (that I've tried - 5 so far), this is great. Combines all of the preset favorites of instagram with the ability to tweak and &quot;fix&quot; as I see fit. My kids love the sticker feature, too.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This isn't your ordinary \\"Hollywood\\" war movie. There's no celebrity actor dodging explosions and saving the day. This is the real deal. This movie will have you at the edge of your seat until the end. The first-person camera view is amazing. It makes you feel like you are there. Of course, the Blu Ray picture and sounds are excellent. This movie is worth every penny and should definitely be in your movie collection!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|It's an ok game.  I was a bit frustrated at first.  I played the first series 3 times before I figured out where to click to go on to the next series of puzzles.  It would be good to have someone explain to the developer the difference between a 'flute' and a 'clarinet'.  I felt the puzzles were pretty easy.
B00377V6J2|5.0|A minimum of 15 stars. 5 each for Albert and Stevie Ray and at least another 5 for the chemistry between the two. This video is a gift for anyone who loves the Blues, Stevie Ray and Albert. The informal setting is perfect, letting the two really loosen up and enjoy each other. We get to be the fly on the wall soaking it all up. We all owe major thanks to the genius who booked the TV date and recorded it so well. Thank you so much. Buy it and enjoy. As others have emphatically said, a bargain and a treasure at any price.
0345803485|5.0|Book came right on time, within 2 days. Once I open this book, it has been difficult to put it down! I was expecting the beginning to drag a little, but within a couple of pages, Ana is already introduced to the infamous Christian Grey. Finished this book in two days and now I have to wait another grueling 2 days to get Fifty Shades Darker, the second book! Can't wait!!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so good I had to rate it. I hope they make another version of temple run with more powerups to buy and upgrade.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|this game was really really bad. I felt like I was in one of thoughs hide and seek book for 3year olds!!!!!
0553582038|2.0|Bran isn't mentioned once. What happened to Tyrion? Cerscei is boring and so is Sansa. Catelyn is brought back from the dead--Why?! Jaime is bad. Jaime is good. Danys sits on her teak bench and does nothing but listen to complaints. Too many characters not integral to the plot. George must be bored as well with his mainstay characters to have abandoned them so callously. And the Others? Four books and thousands of pages in and STILL we know hardly anything about them. {Ahem} George, you're rambling now.<br /><br />This book is boring. And WAY too long. Don't say you weren't warned.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie was no the terrible movie that critics portrayed in their reviews. It was entertaining and my kids loved it. The kids were bummed when the movie ended and I told them there would not be a sequel!
B001TH16DI|5.0|most movies i have to watch with my glasses,but with this series of star trek,who need em'.impressed by this collection went on to get stng.also so impressed gave away my dvd collection of star trek.a most enjoyable collection and highly recommended by me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it takes way too many time of each game to get the points required to nonce on. I believe the points should either be given out more generously or it should be less points to move on
B005LY4B0A|5.0|fun to play and easy to understand, but with enough challenge to keep it interesting.  I enjoy it and my kids do, too.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|[PROLOGUE:  This film features visual depictions of &#34;mindfulness&#34; and &#34;reflective thinking,&#34; subjects which are currently receiving much academic and popular attention, as in, e.g., the practice of meditation.  Mindfulness emphasizes the &#34;awareness&#34; of the &#34;present moment,&#34; as seen in this film.]<br /><br />The accolades accorded to the two leading male actors in this movie are well deserved.<br /><br />What only slowly grew in my consciousness is the outstandingly nuanced performance by the actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, in her role as Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene.  I did not immediately recognize the varied dimensions of this finely nuanced performance, a hidden treasure which I only gradually realized through repeated, extended exposure, coupled with my increasing understanding of the underlying psychological dynamics which this actress's film character may have been experiencing, and which this actress's performance sought to convey - which she does with aplomb.<br /><br />Sidse Babett Knudsen's acting is remarkable for another reason: she is playing more than just one role, she is playing three: (tycoon's) wife, mother, and former lover.  Each of these roles requires very distinct character acting, each of which this actress plays distinctively, convincingly, and with powerful feminine magnetism.<br /><br />Some of the most compelling and effective acting by Sidse Babette Knudsen, as Helene Hansson, is principally conveyed by this actress's wide range of captivating facial expressions, many of which were so subtle and discreet as to be barely perceptible (see her tete-a-tete with Mads Mikkelsen, conducted over a side table at her manor house) - this caliber and range of acting is terrific stuff.<br /><br />I am not bothered, like some, by numerous close-up shots of the film's four principal characters.  Aren't we talking frontal cortex here? I feel these close-up shots are valid and effective, sometime capturing a film character'sprivate, interior moments, and sometimes a film character's behavioral sine qua non - as with the pivotal realization by Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene, to remarks by the grandmother re her son Jorgen's chauffeur, etc. (followed by a close-up shot of a chandelier's dangling glass chimes).<br /><br />Intimate, &#34;non-invasive&#34; close-up shots, taken from the side, enable the tender capture of  &#34;getting to know you&#34; or &#34;catching up&#34; moments, when a young girl touchingly examins the facial expressions of her newly-discovered biological father, to see whether he is genuinely interested in viewing the pictures in her childhood photo album.<br /><br />Considering the magnitude and nature of the information which this film's principal characters have to process, and when and in what contexts they have to process it, close-up shots of eyes may be considered to be part of this film's &#34;action&#34; - as, in fact, it is.<br /><br />I doubt that this film's type of intimate psychological action could be conveyed effectively to an audience in stage acting, where an audience is relatively distant from actors, as it can be conveyed in a film's intimate, and sometimes mandatory, close-up shots, as we see in this film.<br /><br />It's unfortunate for those of us who do not watch or are not saturated or jaded by soap opera, etc., to be burdened and distracted by some commentators' cheapening, maudlin comparisons of this refreshing, high quality film to, e.g., soap opera.
B005HSL626|5.0|I absolutly &lt;3 this game. I am totally addicted to it. Don't listen to all the other people who hats this app,  it is really awesome. trust me,  you'll love it.
0345803485|1.0|I am completely baffled at how everyone seems to be in love with this book. I do not understand the praise and all the positive reviews, especially I do not understand how this horrible written piece of drivel is the #1 NY Times Bestseller. This is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read.<br /><br />This book started off as a Twilight fanfiction, and it definitely shows, with the \\"cliffhanger\\" chapter endings to the horrible Mary Sues, and it reads just as badly as Twilight did. The author obviously cannot write, nor can she edit her work because there were tons of grammatical errors, and she used the same phrasing multiple times (she gasps, she flushes/blushes, she peeks at him, etc). It reads so juvenile, as if I am reading a teenage girl's diary, not the musings of a college graduate (who, by the way, has never used a computer/laptop nor has an email address, in this day and age!)<br /><br />If I were to describe the plot, I would be at a loss, because there is no plot! There is nothing going on, no conflict, etc. Basically, the two main characters fall for each other at first sight. Christian (aka Edward from Twilight) is drawn to Ana (Bella) and manages to charm her with his creepy stalker tendencies that she seems to gloss over. Christian is into BDSM, but Ana is a virgin, not aware of anything, so he tries to introduce her to his world. Basically, they end up having lots of sex, and the only \\"conflict\\" (and I use that word very lightly) is whether or not Ana will stay with Christian given everything about him.<br /><br />The sex is just as poorly written as the rest of the book, and it did not do anything for me at all. In fact, I have actually read some fanfiction that has had well-written sex scenes. But here, it's pretty much laughable. Ana cannot even bring herself to name her own body parts, calling it her \\"down there\\". I don't get how women around the US/world are getting off on this, as there are definitely better written books/etc out there.<br /><br />After forcing myself to finish this book, I will definitely not be reading the next two, and I have no interest in their abusive (and I don't mean the BDSM is abusive, but Christian's controlling \\"all about him\\" persona as abusive) relationship. I lose respect for anyone that actually enjoyed this book/series.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I really love my pink folio cover by Marware!  It is just what I wanted, lightweight, but firm on the back side which stabilizes it when packed. Additionally, the hot pink cover readily distinguishes my Kindle Fire<br />from those of the rest of the family's at our cottage gatherings.
1932100660|5.0|Thought provoking. Well documented research. Life changing.Excellent nutrition and wellness information. Well written Research discussed in a manner anyone can comprehend.
030758836X|5.0|It's hard to review this book w/o giving away spoilers so let me stick to some background basics.  Gillian Flynn's first book Sharp Objects was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Steeped in Southern gothic, creepy, and suspenseful w/a seriously surprise ending.  Dark Objects was in a similar vein but came nowhere close to the first book.  Her third book Gone Girl is back in form with the same mind-twisting plot and wonderful character rendition as Sharp Objects.  As other reviewers have commented, Nick the main character is not that likable. But that's essential to the book actually.  And Amy is just an interesting interesting character.  Nick and Amy are a Manhattan 30-something couple who move back to Nick's hometown in Missouri after losing their jobs and to take care of Nick's ailing mother.  Two years later, Nick and Amy are happily married, or aren't they? This puzzle comprises the first half of the book.  Amy goes missing and the marriage is slowly revealed through alternating perspectives. Pick up this book and prepare to lose at least 2 days of your life.  It was impossible to put down.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Best photo app yet that works on my kindle fire, I love it! Even my kids love editing pics with it and love sharing them on facebook. Great program
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It is a cool game and worth 5 stars if it didn't keep asking me to log into FB. Cute story line nice pictures. It is pretty accurate with where I am touching in the screen in relation to the item I want. I do not think my facebook friends need to know or be spammed about the progress I am making.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think that this game is much more fun than I thought it's pretty weird looking at the pica they have but I got it anyway and its really fun on my kindle
0307279189|5.0|I'm a 230lb 47 y/o male who loved to run short distances but couldn't go too far without my knees killing me. The methodology of this book changed that forever. Granted--it's told in story fashion--but the message it delievers is powerful. Not fully believing the hype,I did research and found there's truth to the technique. I consulted with a professional phyisical therapist as to the pain I was feeling with the change in stride...and he confirmed that it was a complete phyisical reformation of my lower body...and it took 3 months of truly adjusting my stride and not without pain. The net result is that after changing shoes (need to go neutral!) I'm running 5 to 10 mile shots without any pain and feel like I can run much further. I now run 20 miles a week...and still have no desire to run a marathon--but my blood pressure is in great shape and I've dropped 15 pounds.<br /><br />I've recommended this book to at least 9 others who have all had a similar experience.<br /><br />This is not a sales pitch--and I NEVER write book reviews--but I believe in what this book provided me as a life style change and that's why I'm taking the time.<br /><br />Let this book be the door that opens to you the casual runner who would like to go further and/or more. It's a great place to start.
B004QL7K6Q|2.0|Horrible movie, it appears to be made by a bunch of teen boys that have never been with a girl. It really sucks and would never show this movie to anyone that is under age. Would have expected more from this cast.Not good.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Works great! Doesnt freeze phone (using moto photon), runs smooth! I def would recommend app! Does what it says! Great!
B00013M6NK|5.0|It's a must to have a backup battery.  Just went to Russia and in the middle of a day of photo shots, the other battery expired and I was able to quickly continue with this one on hand.  Nikon said I had to use their batteries or the warranty was void.  This battery came from Samy's Photo through Amazon and arrived early so I had it for the trip.  Thanks Samy's for the prompt mailing time.
B0078X2LKY|3.0|I got excited when I saw this book was available for Kindle.  It's a favorite for both my wife and me.  But I was disappointed to discover, after I bought it, that it doesn't work on any of our Kindles.  It will only work on the Kindle Fire (color).  I had to set up a cloud reader to access my purchase.  Still love the book, though.  I was hoping my children would have better access to it.
B004VQK9XW|5.0|Sixx: A.M.'s second album,'This Is Gonna Hurt' is one of the best albums out there. After sampling all the songs on their website I knew buying this would not be a mistake. It proves that if the best in the music buisness come together it can sound just that,the best in the buisness. 'This Is Gonna Hurt',another soundtrack to Nikki Sixx's autobiography,isn't like the first one,'The Heroin Diaries'.And that's a good thing because let's face it,it was pretty dark,as it should have been. This one is more kick-a** than dark,with some very well-written lyrics. 'Are You With Me' is the best one on here which has an up-beat rock rythm to it. 'This Is Gonna Hurt' is original,in a VERY good way. Tracks like 'Sure Feels Right','Smile' & 'Skin' are slower with alot of heart behind them. 'Oh My God' is my favorite song as it says what everyone knows,this world can get better. It packs so much emotion in it you can't help but feel it yourself while listening.<br /><br />I can't ignore 'Live Forever',a clever love song. 'Dealihood',a clever revenge/breakup song.<br />'Help Is On The Way' dips into Nikki's past.The same can be said about 'Goodbye My Friends'.<br />And of course,the wildly popular 'Lies Of The Beautiful People.'<br />All in All,VERY good,regardless if you liked or dislike 'The Heroin Diaries'.Do yourself a big favor<br />and get this album,I gaurantee it won't disappoint.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game it keeps me busy when I'm bored. Not bad for a free game. no I'm not getting money for this review I don't know where in the hell they're getting that crap from. try the game out and judge for yourself.
0345803507|4.0|still a good read. It won't disappoint. You'll have to read the first two in order to understand this last one. The author does a great job in wrapping up the loose ends.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Nice relaxing game.  Only wish you could save and exit- maybe it will after this feedback.  I sure hope so.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this app for my kindle fire and its probably my FAVORITE app to play on there! you should TOTALLY buy this app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy! It opened so many doors for me, showing that this book is more than just two people have sex all the time, but about two people falling in love and what it took for them to open up to each other and get inside. I have never read a book that was so detailed in how love can feel, emotionally and physically. I read all three of the books in 5 days, and a week later decided to reread them all again, and I took my time the second time around. I recommend this to anyone who wants adventure and love all at once.
B005HSL626|5.0|this app gives you hours of enjoyment trying to finish quests to earn new blades and backrounds. best of all this app is FREE! you should totally buy it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Found this book to be quite enjoyable and a real page turner. Good character development and very interesting story line. Found the main character \\"Katniss\\" compelling with conflict written in, both internally and externally. Think it's quite appropriate for young adults despite the overall violent nature of the plot. Be for-warned, this is a trilogy, if you like the first book you will be compelled to obtain the next two book in the series !!
B0085776BG|5.0|recieved on time and in good shape. this is a good movie about our past and a part of history that is some times overlooked.
B005HSL626|1.0|to make thing short and simple the graphics suck the fruit looks fake and you have to unlock stuff I TOTALLY recamend fruit slices the graphics are better the fruit looks real and you don't have to unlock the slice color
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. fast action. I just play it over and over. Simple instructions, doesn't take long to load and it is great while watching a ball game on TV.
B001U0HAYS|3.0|Not bad.  Transfer to Blu Ray is ok - say 7/10 - but not a stand-out.  I could SEE the Blu Ray difference but it was subtle & playing a collectors edition (not Blu Ray) on ordinary DVD on a Blu Ray player, I found little difference.  Probably not worth the purchase JUST for the Blu Ray experience.  The movie, of course is great.
030758836X|4.0|Don't pick up this book if you have an important project at work, or children to care for at home, because the kids will run feral and the project will slip by the wayside as you sneak into the bathroom and closets to finish this page-turner. I'm not sure the book would hold up as well as a second reading due to the surprise element inherent to and necessary for the evolution of the plot -- I could see how on a re-read, it might come across as thinner, less juicy. But this is a terrific roller-coaster of a read, more clever than most beach blanket fare but also much more fun.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is so much more than a dictionary. It is a learning device and an educational MUST HAVE! A new word to learn to pronounce and the definition, daily quotes and facts with links, hangman game, horoscope, and MORE! Not to mention it is a speech friendly dictionary! A Must Have! :-)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book as far as content goes... The reading level is a little off for the audience it is aimed at, but a very steamy book. Already purchased the second and almost finished. Hard to put down....
0811806405|5.0|You can make a guitar from this book, for sure.  This is the book I got when I first started.  It is very specific.  I still refer to this book after making 15 guitars.

0345803485|5.0|I received the books within days and started reading it right away. I love a book that keeps me wanting to read more. And it does. It takes a few chapters to start really getting good, but you don't want to put it down. Its that good :)

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a great game! It is the full appt. Just what I've been looking for. This version you don't have to upgrade to get play. Its really neat looking for the Paranormal. Get it while its free and you get all the full fun. Thanks GS Entertainment, Inc...Hope you put more free stuff just like this is.
0316017930|2.0|Outliers is somewhat of a bait and switch. Rather than being a simple book about the inner workings of the super-successful, it's mostly a tome about society.<br /><br />Of course, Gladwell's thesis is one I'm sympathetic toward. Namely, Gladwell argues that a large part of success is rooted in both social circumstances and luck. One prominent example given is Bill Gates who, according to Gladwell, wouldn't be where he is today if his preparatory school hadn't purchased a computer. And while I agree with this to an extent, surely it cannot be the whole story.  What made Gates different from all the other children in his prep school who had the same opportunity with computers? What was it about Gates which drew him to computing and made him stick with it for so many years when others gave it up? Gladwell doesn't delve into this, preferring to leave it mostly at `luck.'<br /><br />Overall, Gladwell fails to make a cogent argument for this thesis. Almost every bit of evidence provided by Gladwell is anecdotal, and much if it dubious at that. Take, for example, his profile of Chris Langan, a man with a very large IQ who turned out to be somewhat of a failure in life. Gladwell uses this anecdote, which spans two chapters, to show that IQ doesn't matter as much as familial support. Yet Langan comes across as nothing more than an egomaniac who happens to be extremely good at the puzzles on IQ tests (and reading his cooky ideas and watching his game show performance only solidifies that opinion). But rather than questioning the validity of IQ tests, Gladwell is completely taken in by this story.<br /><br />Of the few statistical studies used in Outliers, they tend to be small sets of data which Gladwell uses to draw grandiose conclusions. Near the end of the book Gladwell refers to a study which has failed to be published in an academic journal because \\"it's just a bit too weird.\\" Anybody who has ever read an academic journal will realize that this excuse rings tremendously false, whereas the odds of it simply being a poor study are much higher (and, incidentally, the study isn't all that weird anyway).<br /><br />More than anything, Outliers comes across as an exercise in confirmation bias. Gladwell is rightly skeptical of stories of the \\"self made man,\\" yet is uncritical of any story which happens to support his thesis. In addition Gladwell downplays the importance of genetics, a discussion which is sorely lacking in this book. There's no doubt that Gladwell knows how to relate stories in a fun an interesting way. However, it's unfortunate that he's not more careful with his research and arguments.false, whereas the odds of it simply being a poor study are much higher (and, incidentally, the study isn't all that weird anyway).<br /><br />More than anything, Outliers comes across as an exercise in confirmation bias.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The style of this author seems juvenile and repetitive. Every now and then she uses a \\"big word\\" but then she repeats it several times over.  Like the biting lip bit and rolling eyes. Surely she could have used better descriptives.  I have not read installment 2 or 3 but I have to wonder if they were afterthoughts to number 1.  This first book in the trilogy could have and probably should have ended the story, with a few modications.  The only thing I am anxious to find out is what was the catalyst that molded Christian into the person he is.  That's the story line here, so I'm hoping to find a deeper moral as I read the other books. I found the sex to be (yawn) nothing special and the punishment scenes to be lacking, except for the last one.  Any piece of media that implies that it is okay to stay with someone when he/she physically or emotionally hurts you, is not a message that should be celebrated.  I hope the pace picks up with the subsequent installments.  If the author's intent was to shock, she may have done that to some readers.  But this reader is too mature to be giggling in a closet about dirty sex scenes.
0385535139|5.0|I am one of those who thought Grisham lost his way after his five first fantastic books. He started to lack passion and to go for easy and uninteresting endings. His books got on the best-sellers lists by inertia, because of Grisham's name. This is my opinion, anyway. \\"The Litigators\\" is not back to par with \\"The Firm\\" or his other early work, but it is getting close. Entertaining page-turner with interesting characters and a great original story. I was inclined to give it only 4 stars because I expect more from Grisham than from the others, but the book by itself deserves a five. And all should be equal in front of the law, shouldn't they?
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Flawless packaging, doc, and install.  Paired with Gigabyte MB, 32 GB of memory, 4 3TB HDD's, and dual-boot CentOS 6.2/Windows 7 Pro.<br /><br />Will buy again but might move up to the 8150 for future nodes.  Very pleased with AMD.<br /><br />Note - the fan on this CPU hits up to 8,000 rpm and sounds like a jet taking off when I run my Hadoop benchmarks on it.  Not suited for a quiet environment or needs to be water-cooled.
B0072IVGRY|5.0|The first track has a great beat and rush of guitars in the beginning, and has a punk rock feel. The album would be a favorite for any Cult fan. The songs could fit on any of the old albums spanning all of the different styles. I bought it on cd and vinyl and was really pleased with the effort. CFFC!!!
B007ZMD14I|5.0|Amazing album dripping with melody and filled with terrific guitar work.<br />The only thing better than the choruses are the verses!
B005PK1G76|5.0|I have a bumbleride Indie and this organizer works great! I got it a couple months ago and it still looks like new!

0765316994|5.0|The theme of 'Redshirts' is familiar to anyone connected with the genre since 1967.  The guys in the red shirts are going to die and die in a most horrific manner leaving one of the senior officers to gasp, \\"My God he/she's dead Captain.<br /><br />Andrew Dahl is a young ensign fresh out of the Academy assigned to the Universal Union Flagship \\"Intrepid\\".  he and his fellow noobs soon notice that everyone on board meticulously avoids the Captain, the Doctor, the Cheif Engineer, the Science Officer and Lt. Kerensky whenever the ship gets a new Mission.  They soon discover that while the senior staff returns from each mission unscathed except for Lt. Kerensky who seems to be a rapid healer, all the ensigns and warrant officers die horribly.<br /><br />A crewman named Jenkins who has hidden in the Jeffries tubes of the Intrepid or their equivelant warns them that being assigned to the bridge is a death sentance.  Furthermore his research shows that the Intrepid has a higher per capital staff to crew casualty rate than any other ship in History save one: The fictional USS Enterprise of the United Federation of Planets.  His bizarre explanation of their predicament causes Ensign Dahl to make a decision that might be construed as mutiny to save himself and his fellow 'Redshirts'.<br /><br />I couldn't help but laugh thru the whole book.  There are many many winks at Star Trek, Dune, Star Wars, LOST, and many many other sci fi Movies and TV shows.<br /><br />The weak point for me were the Codas.  Only the last of the 3 really worked.  I can see this being easily made into a film as fun as Galaxy Quest and can't wait.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Wish they had of went just alittle further in development.  The center could've been made from aluminum (I believe this has been said before, but true).  I am not an expert glass or bottle cutter so take it for what it is worth, this one is probably better than the rest.  I read alot of reviews before buying one and this one does work, just gotta work at it.

B003VANOFY|5.0|The G930 is a versatile headset that fits all my gaming needs.<br /><br />These are used to supplement to my computer speakers for when I am gaming at night or want to listen to music while my girlfriend is sleeping.<br /><br />This is great for when I am in Ventrilo for voice chat / gaming in League of Legends.  The wireless feature is very convenient!  Between matches I can grab a snack or run to another room and will know when the match is beginning.  The USB dongle is inside my computer desk and still works well anywhere in my house.<br /><br />I also listen to music while I am cleaning house, doing laundry etc.  The G930 allows me to listen to my music with clarity.  I love the built in volume and programmable buttons on the side.  By default they are play/pause, play next track, play previous track.  I replaced one of the buttons to be my speak-to-chat in Ventrilo.<br /><br />Lastly, the headset is great with comfort.  I game in 2-5 hour sessions and I always forget I have them on.<br /><br />If you need a wireless headset with a lot of extra features and just works the way you need it to, this headset is for you!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I had this and Point of Retreat on my Kindle for months and always chose something else to read instead. These seemed a little too young adult for me. I finally decided to read them as a break from an especially \\"angsty\\" book series. And wow, they were so so good!<br /><br />Slammed was sweet and \\"feel good\\" and also surprisingly heart wrenching. I can add this to my very short list of books that made me cry! I just love Will and Lake. I loved the poetry! I LOVED the book and can't recommend it enough!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|...I expected more psychological thriller.<br /><br />But Denzel's acting skills are at their peak. Ryan Reynolds positively surprised me. There are a couple of small surprises and they play out well.<br /><br />And while this was an action movie, there was respect for Denzel's age. He's still moving but HIS action hero is using more brains than brawn...as well as some reading glasses when necessary.  I'm glad my hero is not trying to pretend to be other than who he is....other than some hair dye here and there.<br /><br />The story line was well put together but something is a little bit lacking AFTER the end, in the wrap up sequences. I'm thinking they were saving a little something in case they want to make a sequel. That usually takes a little steam out and it did here too.
B007VGXS8M|3.0|Def a fun game to play but not really worth the $.99. I enjoyed playing the few levels that are available but if we are being charged, there should be more. For some reason this app is a total drain on my kindle fire battery (just beat the game and plan on uninstalling in just a min) and if you are like me and tend to pause the screen and not clear out app.....change your ways!!! the pause page was burnt into my screen. it went away tho, had to power down for a while. Still, I enjoyed playing and if you do decide to purchase **** remember the color books you have found, it will be a big help on the harder levels knowing exactly what your looking for!!!!
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|In general I enjoyed the movie. However what ruined it was the continual use of stop action slow motion. While the director was trying to show Holmes thought processes it just ruined the flow of the movie. It would have been much better if done at regular speed and treated more like a flashback.<br /><br />This whole stop action slow motion thing seems to be taking over a number of movies. Much like autotune being used on almost every pop song it's over use ruins as opposed to enhances the final product.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game! Its just like Super Mario. I'm sure everyone who played it loves it and if you haven't tried it then download it now!

B005HSL626|4.0|well, I do like this game on the fire a lot, and frankly the ads don't bother me. but it does crash a lot. I would buy it but I'm worried that will crash too. otherwise, lots of fun. cant complain too much about something that's free.
1401937268|3.0|The \\"Angel Tarot Cards\\" by Doreen Virtue is a hefty deck of cards that will make quite an impression on your \\"client\\" depending upon your knowledge of tarot while reading them and your dexterity in facilitating such a large format without the aid of plasticized or gold leaf edges that help keep the cards from sticking.<br /><br />The images on the cards possess the same air-brushed/dreamy quality as the other Doreen Virtue oracle decks ([[ASIN:1401922732 Archangel Michael Oracle Cards: A 44-Card Deck and Guidebook]], [[ASIN:1401924743 Archangel Raphael Healing Oracle Cards: A 44-Card Deck and Guidebook]], or [[ASIN:140190808X Ascended Masters Oracle Cards: 44-Card Deck and guidebook]]--I believe this to be her first venture into tarot and as Virtue wisdom (and business) is centered around angel communication this tarot deck seems a fitting addition to an already widely arrayed offering.<br /><br />However as someone who is by no means an expert, but who has become accustomed to the aspects of tarot, some of which may be deemed frightening to some--Virtue claims that this tarot is \\"gentle, safe and trustworthy,\\" I find the floaty images on the minor Arcana to be insignificant.  Yes, like the Marseilles Deck, this minor arcana depicts the suit as a number, leaving it up to  the reader to interpret through their experience and wisdom the appearance of the card in the reading.  Of course, much of this must occur anyway, but in this case, I expected Virtue to really work on each of the minor arcana and give each card a \\"flavor\\" that speaks to the reader and the seeker of angelic realms.  Instead, she renames the suits to reflect the traditional relationship between the suits and the elements.  Wands become fire. Swords becomes Air, Cups becomes Water and Pentacles/Coins becomes Earth.  All this makes sense, however using mythical creatures like the unicorn to represent air, while pretty has no meaning for me.  For example a group of five milling unicorns within a leafy forest grove adorn the Five of Air card.  Traditionally, the Five of Swords represents a situation that depending upon the next action may result in loss.  By no means a negative card, it urges the Seeker to take a closer look at both sides of the situation and although we may be using our intellect to overwhelm others, it may just come back to bite us.  Swords represent our intellectual side.  Unicorns grazing, no matter how haphazardly, in a copse of wood has little to do with the feel of the card.  if anything I get a feeling of confusion from this card especially after reading Virtue's word indicators at the card's bottom.  The text and image does not gel.  Instead, as this is an angel deck, why not have an angelic figure pointing out the perils of too much intellect?  Angels are messengers of God, and sometimes God must resonate within us a bit of the cautionary tale.<br /><br />I also question the use of specific archangels/angels to represent the signposts of life as depicted by the twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana.  I do not think  much thought was expended on choosing Metatron as  \\"the Fool\\" or, for that matter, Michael as the \\"Emperor.\\"  Choosing Raphael as the card for \\"the Lovers\\" also is traditional, but the reason given by virtue is not.  The card itself just doesn't represent lovers in the literal sense, it suggests a choice and the angel represented in the traditional card is the Angel Raphael--he is depicted because access to some Divine Energy is necessary to make a sound decision using the absolute of truth as a guide.  Raphael as one of the four angels of magical tradition reminds us that we must be honest with ourselves when such a decision must be made.  Virtue just whitewashes the true meaning of the card by talking about soulmates.  Another card usually called \\"the Devil\\" in the traditional deck, here is called 'Ego\\" (why the whitewashing?) and is signified by the appearance of the Archangel Jophiel in the traditional position of the \\"Devil\\" standing behind a man trapped by his own avarice and camouflaged with a deceitful mask.  Jophiel, for me, is representative of the creative force, of imagination of creativity, of creating something out of nothing.  I would call on him when I had writer's block not because I had made decisions that ended up creating a prison of which I was the incarcerated.  Again, this selection makes little sense to me.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Ultimately, \\"Angel Tarot Cards\\" by Doreen Virtue will disappoint avid lovers of the Tarot. From a practical level, the deck is too large to manipulate and sticks together when shuffling and attempting a reading.  From a more esoteric perspective, the deck tries to hard to be lovely and magical, using mythical creatures like dragons, unicorns, mermaids and faeries to depict the minor arcana and specific angels and archangels to represent the Major Arcana that are meant to signify major milestones in one's life journey.  Instead of depicting the creatures in any display of significance to the meaning of the card, Virtue relies on printing the words below the image instead of installing the image within your mind's eye.  Likewise, the selection of specific archangels to depict the Major Arcana seems limiting; I would have rather seen the angel engage in some action that suggested the card's meaning--or the meaning that Virtue intuited while she designed the deck.  Otherwise, the deck is beautiful, different colored backgrounds allow for an immediate categorization of suit.  As in other Virtue decks, the images are floaty relaxing icons that are easy on the eye and obviously, in VIrtue's opinion more palatable than those of traditional tarot.  Nonetheless, the imagery of the tarot is complex and cannot be whitewashed.  Recommended for all those who love Virtue's oracle cards, but not for those true lovers of tarot.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"l\\" standing behind a man trapped by his own avarice and camouflaged with a deceitful mask.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is a real eye opener.  Wonderful read.  I would advise someone of a mature audience.  However it was indeed a eye opener. Kept me waiting to see how the next event would turn out.  WELL DONE.
B002KS1IJC|2.0|I had expected a lot more from this movie, but it let me down. It was boring after the first 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />But then, that's me. I expected a lot more from Prometheus too, but it was too much like Alien(s). Cyborg. Pop out of your gut monsters.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Fiona's since the beginning and I am always first in line to buy her newest release.<br /><br />I purchased the deluxe edition not expecting much. ...When I opened the envelope and pulled out this great 'diary-type' book I was stunned !  flipping through the pages I couldn't stop thinking how cool it was and how (for the price I paid) that there is no-way her record company could be making any money because of the 'extras' given with the tunes. the book is amazing and it reminds me of the good old days when you would listen to a record and gaze at the album cover the entire time the album played... reading lyrics along with the songs if they were included.  ....in this case YES they are included, and better yet you are basically reading them hand-written from Fiona's Journal !!!  Excellence.<br />The First thing I did was watch the DVD of her performing at SXSW and spilling her guts out for the audience... awesome songs both new and old... ..  I was wishing it would have lasted much longer !<br />Next I listened to her new CD... . Immediately it got right to her feelings.... mostly about her Ex-boyfriends... some of her current boyfriend(s)...her exclaiming that it is too good sometimes and that she feels she isn't worthy or that she is more comfortable being alone.  .... good times yes, but her anger spills out so heavily that at one point she is basically scream-singing her anger as to get her point across.<br />You can't compare this to anybody, she is a force all-her-own and with your purchase you get to read her diary, see notes of the production and get a first-class tour deep inside her pretty little head !!!<br /><br />I LOVE HER !  I LOVE THIS EFFORT !!!  ... You can not criticise her true feelings.  If you criticise this go back to your Katy Perry drivvel.<br /><br />I wish Bjork would listen to this and get back to singing about HER feelings instead of getting so cosmic and singing about the elements on other planets.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game<br />excellent graphics and inventiveness of the fun stuff is amazing and entertaining.  I have never been one to play games and I am finding myself playing this off and on all day long.

1594744769|4.0|A fun creative change of pace to YA literature. The pictures are such an intriguing touch to the book.  I know they say not to judge a picture by its cover, but that is exactly what got me.  I wasn't disappointed.  This is such a nice change of pace to the repetitive themes so prevalent in YA today.

0821221841|5.0|I am not a fan of Ansel Adams' photography, but I am a big fan of his instructive books on photography. This is the best book that I have come across for a basic explanation of cameras and how they work (e.g., aperture, shutter speed, hyperfocal distance, different types of cameras). I purchased and read this book about 4-5 years ago when I was really getting into photography, but now, with time, I can really see how I have benefited from it.

0393088774|5.0|This is an extremely important book for understanding the current crisis, and is very well written with good background material supporting his arguments.<br />Krugman sees the major problem as too little consumer demand. There is too much saving even at a zero interest rate. Worldwide, people are buying less than they are capable of producing. We are living in a world that Keynes described, he says.<br />On income and wealth inequality, Krugman notes that raising the issue is to enter a political war zone. Anyone who raises the issue will encounter fierce attacks from those hired to protect the interests of the wealthy. Although Krugman sees inequality as an important issue, he does not see it as the cause of the crisis. Rising inequality preceding the Great Depression and the Great Recession could be a coincidence, he says. But he points out other negative effects of inequality<br />Krugman argues that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act stimulus was too small and a much greater one is needed. And, the Federal Reserve Bank should increase the money supply enough to generate a higher inflation rate, suggesting 4% per year. A higher inflation rate would reduce the burden on debtors, he points out.<br />He gives a convincing argument that those advocating austerity sound wise but are utterly wrong in their view. He talks about the belief in the \\"confidence fairy\\" by those who believe cuts in government spending will stimulate the economy by increasing business confidence.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Fiona Apple's \\"The Idler Wheel...\\" is quite a stunning album. While it may not be immediately digestible, the record is worth the extra attention and focused listening, demonstrating meticulous song construction. The nuances, especially in its instrumentation, allow the album's lyrics to shine. \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is lyrically dark and serves as an outlet of catharsis for Fiona Apple. It is well-crafted so that its message is neither cheesy nor over dramatic. The metaphors are poignant, making the songs especially striking. Combined with Fiona's top notch vocals, \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is a must own album. So far it is one of my favorite ones to come out this year, maybe even in the past few years. I had my doubts, but it was dispelled after seeing her fabulous performance with The Roots and diving into the lyrical content. Don't miss out on this gem!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written. Sucked me in within the first few pages and never let go.  Reading the second book now... so far, just as good.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|The first Ghost Rider film and Drive Angry were bookends of redneck fun for fans of mindless action and Nick Cage. I liked them both. But this film feels like a foreign attempt to recreate American drive-in style entertainment and it comes off as odd in all the worst ways. The special affects are great, but the acting and directing are off kilter. Even Cage comes off as a parody of himself.
B0086700CM|1.0|the only reason In don't. like this ..... app is because. it wouldn't. download for like 72 hours. boo bye peace
B004UMVW7E|3.0|Many people follow Siddhartha's journey in their quest for enlightenment.  But as Siddhartha tells Govinda in the end the book how he found his, I feel kind of the same way when it comes to our own personal journey.  I don't really feel that the story is that great, it does have all of the elements of the hero's journey, but from the beginning of the story I just found Siddhartha completely pompous and annoying.  I can see why so many people enjoy the book, I do but it just wasn't for me I suppose.
1741797802|5.0|Just like all Lonely Planet guides, the India edition is very informative and a great jumping off point.  However, once you get some bearings I hope you look beyond it's pages.

B00846TTDG|5.0|This is one of the best movies i have ever seen.  highly recommended if you enjoy action and war movies.
0307730697|5.0|I don't need to elaborate or reiterate what has already been said.  I just want to add my 5 stars as this is a most excellent book depicting the life of a true American Hero Adam Brown.  I laughed, I cried, and most of all I felt deep respect for this man and all those around him.  God truly worked around and through this man and is still doing so.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I came late to this rodeo and bought the trilogy for Kindle because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. This book has all of the nuance of \\"Pat the Bunny.\\" Ana is awkward and innocent. Look at how awkward Ana trips walking innocently into the room. Ana is so innocent, she only dunks her teabag once into the hot water, lest it be too bold for her delicate sensibilities. Christian is enigmatic. Listen to the enigmatic things Christian says. See him enigmatically smile, then frown. See how Christian Grey's grey eyes are all enigmatic and indecipherable. Oh, look! Ana just called him enigmatic! And her irritatingly twee \\"inner goddess\\" agrees that Christian is, indeed, an enigmatic enigma.<br /><br />I'm only halfway through book one, but had to tell someone how really bad this book is. You know, I can't escape the feeling that these books were actually written for teens, a la \\"Twilight,\\" which is really an awful thought, considering the graphic sex scenes. While graphic, there is nothing remotely erotic about this book. I find it really odd that the auther can't even own the book's claim to erotica by putting actual names to the body parts. It's like she's using Ana's innocence and first-person narrative to cover for her own unwillingness to commit fully to the genre. Furthermore, she clearly is urging her audience to fill in the gaps of what she is unwilling to put in print by having Christian encourage Ana to \\"do research\\" and to \\"begin with Wikipedia\\" if she doesn't understand any of the terms he's used in their sex contract. Clearly, like \\"Twilight,\\" this book was written in an adolescent formula that would sell to a mass audience. While it makes me so very sad that this book is considered so good by so many, it also gives me great hope that I can whip out a bestseller by week's end.
1455502626|4.0|Two scientists that work at Plum Island, an animal disease research facility, turn up dead outside of their house.  While this could have been a simple case of a burglary gone wrong, the fact that they worked at Plum Island, with highly communicable diseases, has everyone on edge.  Convalescing NYPD Homicide Detective, John Corey, is asked to help out on the investigation.  To complicate matters more, John was a friend of the murdered scientists.<br /><br />This was a good story and had a very clever plot.  John Corey is an interesting character, but I think his snarkiness was sometimes pushed too much, to the point of becoming annoying, not only to the other characters, but to the reader as well.  The remainder of the characters were well-drawn.  The story did become tedious and bogged down in sections, which made the book seem a little longer than it needed to be.<br /><br />I was a little surprised by where John ends up at the end of the story, but I will be reading the next in the series.  Overall, it was a good story and a good mystery.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game! I love how there are so many different types of games. The games challenge you so much which is a great way for you to learn more skills and have fun!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! As you might have gathered from other reviews, this is NOT a trail guide, or a book solely about details of hiking - this is a book about growth, awareness, acceptance, soul-searching and soul-finding. I was hooked from the first word - and when I was done reading it, I downloaded the audio version.<br /><br />The book would not be what it is without Cheryl Strayed's vulnerability, honesty, and willingness to tell her story, all of it: the good, the bad, and the ugly, as well as the beautiful. Parts of it were heart-wrenching and difficult to read, parts were funny and touching, all of it added up to a very moving book.<br /><br />I enjoyed having Oprah's notes through the book. I liked seeing which passages she highlighted and why, and how the same paragraph might strike us both very differently, though each of us got something meaningful from it. I didn't find it distracting at all, though others might.<br /><br />I have read some reviews that are critical for Ms. Strayed's lack of explanation for HOW she grew and changed, how she made the changes she made, but I think most of us don't have that knowledge about ourselves, at least not in a way that can be prettily summarized in a chapter. It is enough to know that this hike changed her. I don't need to know how she incorporated those changes; the story of the hike is enough.<br /><br />Just as: It is enough to know this book has profoundly affected me, I don't need to be able to articulate the details, loving this book is enough.<br /><br />If you are judgmental, close-minded, don't like sex or people who like sex, and have never made a bad decision in your life, this book probably isn't for you. (read some of the one-star reviews for details) If you live your life fully human, open to possibility, if you sometimes make poor choices in order to keep moving forward, you may very well love it.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|They spent $200 mil. making and promoting this stinker? Wow, a hundred mils don't get you much, does it? If you're older than 5, you'll quickly realize how stupid this movie is. Stupid plot, stupid acting, stupid not-too-special effects. If you've seen Star Wars (and who haven't), you'll quickly see the scenes and creatures as the rejects from SW movies.  Any plausible storyline and characters are sacrificed in an attempt to appease the widest audience possible and ultimately satisfying no one (whoever thought of that stupid dog creature should be banished forever from movie making). As for the main character, where did they find this actor, a wooden statue in front of a sports store? I haven't bothered to look up his name as it's unlikely I'll see him in anything again.  Lucky I only spent a dollar renting this Turkey.<br />UPDATE: Just when you thought the main actor couldn't be in anything worse, he's in a WORSE MOVIE - Battleship! One more strike and he's totally out - maybe he's already! This movie AND Battleship is on almost every critic's list of worse 10 movies of 2012! Oops, just saw \\"Savages\\", the new Oliver Stone movie not realizing he's in it. Well,  strike three!
0061537969|5.0|I happen to love dogs, but don't give a hoot about racing.  You don't really need either to find yourself captivated by the story of a race car driver's family, joy, love, loss and grief told through the voice of his beloved and most intelligent dog, Enzo.  This book is about consciousness, living in the moment, savoring sensory experiences and offering unconditional love.  Anyone with a heart will be reaching for tissues at the end of the story.  Garth Stein has written a classic novel suitable for a wide audience that will capture your heart.

B000055ZB8|5.0|Sorry to say, this is not very scary.  I love vampire movies and while I admire the abilities of the actors to tell a story without speaking I have seen many vampire movies that are a lot scarier.  The appearance of the vampire was interesting, and nothing like other Dracula movies.  The musical score was also very good.  But some of the scenes verged on the \\"You've got to be kidding, right!\\"  The scene of Dracula carrying his coffin were actually kind of funny, or maybe I should say, quite odd.  And his bug-eating servant was also interesting.  And what's up with Dracula walking around in the daytime?  The level of a willing suspension of disbelief is quite high!  But it is an interesting film and the cinematography is lovely.  I had of course heard of this film.  It is legendary, but it was just not very scary.  I would say I was only mildly creeped out, and never actually got to scared.  And I like my vampires sexy, like Frank Langella.  That's my favorite Dracula.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel but it did take a bit to get beyond the idea of the narrator being a comatose mother.  Despite that, I did become engrossed in the mystery as Rosamund Lupton is a great story weaver.
B003X897D2|2.0|I bought this via my Kindle Fire because it was being promoted, was a great deal, and I wanted the album.  I didn't realize until after I purchased it that this MP3 collection is missing 5, of the original 12, tracks on the album.<br /><br />Still a good value for 7/12 of an album, I guess?
B000H5TVKI|4.0|At the time this movie came out I was blown away. To rewatch it years later didn't feel blown away anymore but do feel it still holds up.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Chris's style is clear and easy to read as well as entertaining.  The book has stories and real life examples that support the concepts and will help get you in the mindset of bootstrapping and dong it as cheap as possible. Well worth the read and purchase...
006097625X|5.0|I really don't want to write a lengthy review about this book (Well...I tried), for there aren't as many things to complain as to clarify.<br /><br />This book is exactly what it promises. I'm not used to black-&-white comic art, but some pages into the book I forgot that totally; the conceptual diversity and exploitation of visuals for their representation hooked me right away. And, when you reflect on the ideas, their developments and conclusions that Scott McCloud keeps stating, you can easily imagine this as an academic essay or a formal conference: really solid thinking.<br /><br />There is, perhaps, a situation which didn't much disliked me as surprised me and changed my experience with this book (not for worse, but truly different). Let me just call it (for the fun of it)  \\"Yea, it's goo...WHOA, TOO GOOD, TOO GOOD.\\" Hehe. Or \\"Is it good? Mmm. It seems goo..WHAM![IN YO FACE] GOOD IDEED!\\"<br />It's just the tone. I wasn't expecting a book this in-thought, conceptually rich/solid, rigorously studied... it just surprised me. I found myself laughing at some part in which he synthesizes, wonderfully in one or two comics' pages, concepts from McLuhan thoughts about media and thinking to myself \\"you... magnificent bastard!\\" (because it was something I was wishing without looking for it). Can you get the idea now? More than I was looking for, which makes it part of my permanent collection of valuable materials; but nobody warned me! Why did I got the impression that this book was lighter and softer than it actually is? It could be just me... right?<br />I bought with the intent of reading it quickly, I ended up, at weekends, reading Chapter 2 & beginning of 3 (the most dense ones?) at a pace of two pages each 3 or 4 hours and going back to mentally rephrase and make better connections between concepts. That didn't felt bad, actually; that felt refreshing and a healthy challenge. I got used to that.<br /><br />So, sorry for making it this long; hope was worth it. Justremember, you, \\"nameless-ageless-neutral-gender potential\\" reader... adjust your expectations and prepare for the ride. (From slacking in the beach to motorcycling in Cornell? Heheh)

0141024534|2.0|While I agree with Klein that the economics of the last decades has been disastrous for the majority, I believe she is, at bottom, diseminating disinformation.<br /><br />Naomi Klein asserts that instead of creating disasters, our government officials sit around watching and literally - praying - for them to simply happen. This is where she is WRONG.<br /><br />I appreciate her effort, her research and the points she is trying to make, but her premise is obviously false.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can not say enough about these books.  They revived my husband's and my love life.  I know there is bad reports on these books saying they are pornographic and one person that I read said, \\"they were worried about what does it say about our society wanting to be hurt during sexual intercourse with our partners.\\"  I like to say to this person, take a pill! Haven't you ever had a sexual fantasy?  The books are just entertainment and in my opinion, extremely, extremely, extremely wonderful entertainment. Have fun reading the books and then have fun in the bedroom!
B004GHBQCE|5.0|To all Johnny  Cash fans,<br />this, has got to be the most tear jerking Cash album I have ever owned, and heard. I will never forget the day I went to buy this beautiful, emotional album in 2003. I played it over and over, and even bought it for another blind friend and took it to the blind school in Canada in my last year of high school. I never did graduate, and this album helped me through some very emotional, tough times in my life from that period. I am 27 and this CD, is the most beautiful, touching album I have ever heard in my life. Like with so many other reviewers, I cannot listen to Hurt, without shedding tears. Heartwarming! I have all of Johnny's albums now and listen to him frequently. I will never stop listening to this beautiful singer. He had to go through some rotten times also, and as gravley and shaky his vocals are, he still puts so much feeling in these wonderful songs. Johnny, you shall always be my hero.<br />hemantha.maheen@gmail.com<br />Would love to hear from other Cash and music fans!

B005HEU5DG|5.0|::MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD::<br /><br />This is a fantastic episode! Could have easily been a two parter. The most exciting battle scene so far in the series up to this point. Even young Wesley Crusher who is a full ensign here does an awesome job at the helm. I can't get enough of Geordi yelling \\"Coolant leak! Coolant Leak! Anti-matter containment critical, warp core breach imminent!\\" The supporting guest stars from the other enterprise did a spectacular job, the other captain in particular, her actions were indeed honorable. But most importantly this episode is the one that gives Tasha Yar an honorable farewell, instead of being killed off senselessly by an evil garbage bag monster earlier in the series. Memorable quotes from this episode include the title of this review and when picard shouts \\"not good enough dammit! not good enough!\\" I remember watching as a kid and that line has always stuck with me, Patrick Steward's acting chops are very impressive indeed. I highly recommend this episode, it is one of my top ten.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|My wife and I are seniors and of Scottish descent. We thought it was a ripping good yarn! The children in the theatre had almost no problem with the accent, since it was toned down significantly from the Brogue for English speaking audiences, as was \\"Braveheart\\".<br /><br />It was a delightful tale. Much better than the mediocre Disney animated films of the last 10-15 years. I enjoy most of the Pixar films though. I thought the script was well written and the choice of voices for the film was excellent. Have long been a fan of Billy Connolly for other things.<br /><br />The animation was absolutely wonderful. The characters were purely animated but the background scenery seemed almost real.<br /><br />I go to movies for an escape, which is why I hate \\"reality\\" anything. This is certainly my idea of a great way to put the world on hold and float away for a short time. It revives the spirit.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Shortbus is a film about sexual relationships that takes both a humorous and very direct almost documentary approach with none of the falseness of commercial porn. There are several sets characters who attempt to negotiate relationships and struggle to find satisfaction. The different plot strands come together at a club called Shortbus.  There is sex therapist who is unable to experience orgasm.  And frustration, disappointment and awkwardness is very much part of the film's subject.  Nothing is prettied up with overly emphatic lighting design and the character's desire and longing is portrayed in a straightforward and subtle style.  The film neither pathologizes unconventional sex, as mainstream productions frequently do nor does it present some \\"no consequences\\" sexual utopia.  There are times when the pace seems to drag and when the diffuse plot lines meander and lose tension and drive but on the whole and an impressive suggestion at what a mature and frank future cinema could look like.  it represents, at least in part, an example of what I'd like to do in my own future productions.<br />---- Rob Same, author of [[ASIN:B008AZQ87Q Madonna 666]]<br /><br />At times a very melancholy but always thoughtful film.

B0083GR6Y6|3.0|This movie was a semi dud in my opinion. The acting was not all that great, the special effects were amateur and the premise were somewhat far fetched.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|I am a life long Crowes and CR - New Earth Mud fan.  I have both previous CR cds-- both studio and several live recordings.  This new CRB cd has grown on me since first listen. At first I was a little disappointed with 7 songs, but this could be jam band of the year.  Way more psychedelic, trippier and has that Cali mellow goove.  I do like his first 2 solo efforts better than the new one, however CR is still my favorite singer and these new, insightful lyrics, are heart-felt and REAL ( check out 100 Days of Rain).  The new guitarist (Cassal) has a \\"jamband sound\\" with noodly solos. The organ (Crowes player) has an old school 70's sound and the rest of the band is tight per usual.<br />Def buy this to support CRB and go see them live in your town. I have seen the Crowes 25+ times and NEM several times as well, but NOT the new lineup of CRB.<br />My fav song is from his original '03 tour \\"Reflections on a Broken Mirror....\\"  Also love - \\"Tulsa Tomorrow\\" \\"STAR or STONE\\" \\"Rosalee\\" - you sweet country thang ...Sho Nuff know how to make me smile...classic Georgia gooves.
B004QSQML8|3.0|After debuting with \\"Duellists,\\" and following it with the legendary SF classics \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner,\\" Ridley Scott's fourth feature film was the curiosity known as \\"Legend.\\" In the US, it kinda flopped; in Europe, it got vaguely noticed, maybe even popular. The movie had a curious afterlife for the rest of the century on premium, then regular cable, though it's hard to gauge whether it gained any fans. I remember running into this movie often while channel-surfing; I only ever saw portions of it for a long time.<br /><br />Three years before \\"Willow\\" and other movies moved the CGI revolution's first phase into high gear, \\"Legend\\" is therefore one of the last fantasy films with traditional non-CGI effects, some of which are actually quite good. Some nice visuals, decent sound design.<br /><br />As for the quality of the story and the characters, that's debatable. Tis standard-issue good vs evil fairy-tale stuff, though leaning towards the dark. After or before (?) the infamous dream sequence of certain versions of \\"Blade Runner\\", Scott brings unicorns to the forefront of this film, the driving plot point and MacGuffin. (But whale song? What- really!?!)<br /><br />Although in some respects it doesn't quite gel, \\"Legend\\" has its moments and its nice ideas, and it is here presented to its full potential. The Blu-Ray has two versions: the truncated US version scored by Tangerine Dream, and the longer European version with a traditional and old-fashioned (for him) Jerry Goldsmith score. (There are nice soundtrack albums for both, by the way.)<br /><br />Extras are fairly plentiful: galleries, a commentary, a few interesting deleted/alternate/planned scenes, a set of trailers (oddly using snippets of \\"Alien\\" score), and a really nice and fairly thorough behind-the-scenes documentary (although Tom Cruise is absent.... was he too busy or what?). With a movie like this, that seemed not to have lived up to its full potential, it's really nice to have two versions of it to watch and listen to.to watch and listen to.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome!!!! i never thought temple run would ever come!!! Especially for free!!! Awesome. It is wonderful on Kindle Fire. Awesome

B007MAETA8|5.0|Very folky and mellow cd. Reminds me of some Tom Petty, Van Morrison and Crosby, Stills  Nash at times. Love it!!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The Hunger Games is not only the perfect movie for fans of the book, but is also a most wonderful movie for those who haven't read the book.  Sometimes a movie based on a book leaves giant plot holes and it's difficult to follow if you haven't read the book.  Other times a movie will try to stay true to a book but lose all creativity and excitement when translated onto film.  This movie doesn't fit either of these categories.  It is a complete story and beautifully crafted.<br /><br />Katniss is such a strong and unique heroine.  It's not often we get a strong female, who is portrayed full of flaws and strengths that are not lovable.  But you find yourself rooting for her.  She is the glue of the whole story.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the way the Games are portrayed.  The sickening fascination and joy the Capital takes in having teenagers kill each other is portrayed in a way that is relatable to our own society.  The pain of many of the contestants is palpable and I was very moved when some of the contestants die.<br /><br />Another awesome part of the movie: the cast.  Jennifer Lawrence brings life to Katniss in a way that no one else could.  I wasn't sure I would like Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (because of my own ideas from the book) but he brought sensitivity and class to the part.  Liam Hemsworth is a sexy and strong Gale.  And the rest of the cast is absolutely spot on for each of their various roles: Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, etc. You couldn't ask for a better group of actors!<br /><br />Overall:  If you haven't seen this movie, do it.  Now.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I purchased this book in addition to the first in the series because the movie had become so popular. Wasn't sure if I'd like it because it sounded kinda grim, but figured if it was a series and they'd made a movie already, maybe it would be good enough. A series is usually nice because you have the next book to look forward to trying in the same story line. Catching Fire is a great follow-up! I like an \\"easy read\\" before bed. I was hooked in the first chapter! I consumed the 1st book in the series in 4 days of before-bed reading. I paced myself a little better with the 2nd book so as to savour it it a little more. Very easy read. Not taxing to follow. Almost finished with the 3rd book...
B007MG360G|5.0|Much more user friendly than the other games in its series, with helpful hint giving borders. Great way to pass time away. Gamers have to be patient and need to use their memory if they want to proceed in the game at a steady pace but it can truly be played and completed by all ages. I definitely think it's worth the download. Enjoy!
0345803485|1.0|After all the hype and reviews thought this would be a fun easy read, oh I was so terribyl wrong!  I can't believe they talked about this book on Good Morning America and it's a Best Seller.  Horrible writing - could she be anymore repetitious?  They murmur and mutter through the entire book - just about every page.  Holy crap, Holy *$)!, eye rolling, growling, lip biting, blushing, chatter about her inner goddess and subconcious,referring to her vagina as \\"my sex\\" or \\"down there\\", condoms were \\"foil packets\\" ugh!  The entire premise was a complete turn off - yeah, I want to be trained like a dog to please a man and sign a contract, what?  There is nothing romantic or erotic about this story.  I am not a prude, I can appreciate people doing whatever they want to enjoy their sex life, but it should be with trust, love and intimacy not signing contracts being ordered around.  The horrible writing didn't help - the sex scenes were boring and down right laughable.<br /><br />It was torture trying to finish the book but finally made it through.  I will not be reading the trilogy.<br /><br />I am sure the movie will be a bazillion times better, unless they murmur and mutter the entire movie, then we won't be able to understand what they are saying.<br /><br />Save your money and skip this one.  My inner goddess is totally rolling her eyes!

0345803485|3.0|I, unfortunately, am on the third and final book of this trilogy.  I must say that after reading the first book, I was quite ambivalent as to proceed on.  I felt compelled to read the second book because I have the darn trilogy and needless to say it dragged on and on with repetitious acts of the same verbiage.  She climaxes with the sound of her name and the talks of the scent of that is oh so Christian Grey.  And, yes, I had to wonder how the this male character came to light in the writer's mind as he seems to be too perfect and every girl/woman's fantasy.  Then, the female character....good Lord...talk about weird, immature, inexperienced and seem to have some psychological issues of her own as she is constantly talking to her subconscious and her \\"inner goddess.\\"  Again, weird!  He (the male character) is just as weird!  He falls in love with her over a VERY VERY  short period of time, which is just creepy and makes him undesirable when you think about it  I mean he goes gaga over this female character who, as I stated, is straight-up weird and actually the both of them are pretty unstable emotionally so they belong together, I guess.  Despite it all, I forced myself to finish the darn second book and, yes, I am reading the third.  Yada...Yada...Yada!  Now, I yawn at ever page that I turn and even skim to get the to some point in the book that just gives me an idea of getting to the end.  Not good!<br /><br />Despite my disappointment, you have to give props to the writer for having such an erotic imagination.  I really thought this book was targeted towards the middle aged woman who needed a little bit of \\"spice\\" in her life.  But, I quickly realized that this book was targeted for the young, inexperienced woman.  Read the first book if you must but getting the whole trilogy is not worth it.  Better yet, just wait for the movie :-).
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I got the g2 Bottle Cutter to cut old wine and beer bottles for tumblers and candles. I'm pretty cheap, so I had considered making my own rig, but when the price on this dropped to ~$25, I had to give it a shot.<br /><br />This product is awesome! I lay the scored bottle on the bottom of the sink (to avoid extra cracks from gravity stress) and alternate pouring boiling and cold water on the bottle instead of using hot and cold baths. I get a nice clean cut most of the time (if it cracks wrong, it's my fault for being lazy and not oiling the blade/making a jumpy cut). I started making candles instead of just glasses, and my friends and family LOVE them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cutter.  Go green, AND make unique gifts for super cheap! (hint: You don't need to buy/drink all the wine and beer--recruit your friends to do so, and just take their empties.  Lots will oblige for just one candle or glass in return...)

B007SGM084|5.0|50 Shades of Grey is a great book! Love, danger, and it is sexy too! Loved this Trilogy!!! I am reading it again for the second time!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is not the type of book that I normally read.  It was ok- I read it all but wouldn't read it again.
0062197258|5.0|Normally, I'm not a big fan of non-linear story-telling - I find that the use of flashbacks and the like can wind up feeling like it disrupts the flow of a story and ultimately detracts from the plot.  In this case, though, it is used to great effect; in fact, it's probably one of the best uses of this particular tool that I've ever come across.  By simultaneously telling readers about Cathy's past and present, the contrast between the person she used to be and who she is presently is stunning and terrible and sad, and really amps up your interest to see what exactly transpired that radically changed her in every aspect.<br /><br />The contrasts also extend to the men in her life.  As mentioned in the book summary, the quotes included on its cover, and in other reviews, her past centers around what begins in a whirlwind of attraction and passion, and devolves into a horrific downward spiral of violence, controlling behavior, fear, and desperation.  Ms. Haynes delves into domestic violence in such a way as to make it brutally real, from start to finish.  We read along as the first man's initial mystery and intensity gradually become rage and obsession.  The agony (mental and physical) are fully described; it is truly an unflinching portrayal of abuse that is disturbing, scary, and not exactly easy to read, but is the catalyst for Cathy's OCD and other changes - physical, emotional, and social - so it did not in any way feel gratuitous or unnecessary.<br /><br />At the same time, the man in her present seems to be the total opposite - sweet, compassionate, and dealing with some emotional baggage of his own - and perhaps just the thing she needs so that she can begin to heal from her unimaginable trauma(s).  Present-day Cathy is a shell of her former self; where she once used to love the night life and socializing (yes, that is partially euphemistic), she is now much more reclusive, and her life is utterly controlled by her OCD.  As far as the disorder is concerned, again, Ms. Haynes does not shy away from describing Cathy's complex, time-consuming rituals and how her attempts to feel safe and in control make her feel so much despair and frustration.  She is a normal, authentic person, which makes the horrors that befall her that much more tragic, frightening, and heart-breaking.  Everything she thinks, feels, and does is so real that one can't help but root for her to recover.<br /><br />I confess that I was a little leery about reading this one, because in my experience, when a book receives a massive amount of praise and glowing reviews, it all too often turns out to be less than superlative, to put it mildly.  In this case, every bit of praise is richly deserved.  This book is, by turns, suspenseful, sad, frustrating, eye-opening, and even sometimes uplifting and inspiring.  Perhaps the best compliment I can give it, though, is that I just couldn't put it down - I had to find out what happened to Cathy - and when it was all said and done, and I had turned the final page, the book - its characters, its horrors, and its conclusion - stayed with me.  The bottom line is that this normally might not be the type of book to which I would gravitate, but now I can honestly say that it's one of the best books I've read in a long time.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|$100 Startup is the most pragmatic and action-oriented start-up book I have read, and I have read many.  I especially love Chris's ultra simplified concept rating system to choose which new business venture idea to work on next.  The system I had invented for the same purpose was much more complex and time consuming but yielded the same results.<br />  I recommend this book to every person I meet who tells me they want to start a new business like mine.  This book lays out the blueprint for the most important part of any new business venture- just starting!<br />  I refer back to the book often as I am in the process of beta testing my new business and I continue to be inspired by the stories in the book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it!! just another Facebook type game but very addicting. they definitely chose a great game to make better I used to play the original in school ha ha
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing work out video's on and off since i was a teenager....some video's are too long....too hard....get old fast.....etc....  this video has enough variety in the 20 minute workouts that you don't get bored..and no matter how difficult it is...you know it doesn't last long.  YOu feel like you had a great workout when you are done...and you dont' DREAD doing it when it's time to workout.  I strongly recommend this video.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I play this game almost nonstop. it is  very addicting and easy to learn. add me as a neighbor! twizzler0823
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|At first I thought that this would be a good app for drawing. Sadly I was mistaking, I wanted to be like the one on the IPAD commercial, but it turns out this was a waste of 2 dollars. So if you want a serious drawing app DO NOT buy this one.
0374275637|3.0|A truly fascinating topic delivered in a very readable style.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the depth of details was completely lost on me, to the point that I found boring.  As a result I came away with the feeling that \\"the more you know, the less you know\\".  Clearly, understanding how we interpret the world around us is fraught with all sorts of influences seemingly minute and not-quite-so unimportant as one might think.<br /><br />It's incredibly hard to be intuitive about such stuff!  (referential pun intended)<br /><br />I could only wade through the first 1/3 of the book before crying 'uncle'.  A statistician friend got 3/4 through before putting it down.<br /><br />I'll probably pick it up again sometime, but I really do wish he got less into the weeds on this one.<br /><br />Obviously, his story is about the weeds.
B006DHASYM|5.0|I loved it! The moment it arrived I watch it and it was awesome... the extra scenes, the extended content... everything... highly recommended.. plus I looove the movie!
B007SGM084|5.0|Great quality, few/no typos, delivered quickly to my kindle!! Love the books.  It could have been a little cheaper, but for getting all three books in one it was a decent price.  Definitely less than buying all three separate or buying them in stores.  Laters, Baby :)
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am a life long fan of Music. This is another great album. I am so happy they keep giving us new music.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun to use when you don't have anything to do even though you just run away from freaky monkeys and try to take the idol sometimes you get addicted and cant stop<br /><br />tip. you should try to get all of the power ups
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finished the trilogy in 3 days. These are great books! I can't wait for the movie! I missed the characters so much, I re read the books in a week!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Well done hidden object game. Would have expected a little better dialogue and some character animation for the price. But considering its the free app of the day, well worth the download
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I waited over 8 months to see Snow White and the Huntsman and now I have seen it a total of 5 time at the movie theater. This movie is so perfect and epic. I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. For a first time director Rupert Sanders did a fantastic job. The way he retold this story and made it new again. Snow White has always been my favorite princess as a child and to see it be remade I can honestly say I prefer this movie to the Disney cartoon version. Kristen Stewart really lived up to the character Snow White and her made her a bad-a**. Charlize Theron made for an incredible evil queen. I really believe both Kristen and Charlize made this movie. I was so amazed by how incredible the visual effects were. I think everyone will enjoy this movie as I did. It's beautiful and epic. Now there is talks about a second film in the making and I couldn't be more excited.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|A stunningly remarkable journey, replete with<br />lingering astonishments and pulchritudinous<br />environments, splendidly captured in their natural<br />effulgent glory. Narrated with punctilious timing,<br />a notable perspicacity though mildly magniloquent,<br />and soothing inflections despite occasional moments<br />of malevolent territorial disputes and tense encounters<br />for natural resources. Planet's \\"Diaries\\"' is wholly<br />meritorious in its laborious achievements and impressive<br />contrivances,  providing us with exceptional experiences<br />of our confounding, nurturing, and ever-changing Mother.<br /><br />It's simply awesome.<br /><br />A one star deduction for hints of Darwinism and<br />Global Warming.
B007MG360G|4.0|it is fun but to short. it is not really worth the money. g h g g f d e r dvf g y h h h h b Bc g
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a totally awesome game. completely addictive and a good way do kill time. I just totally love it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|real kid pleased...catches me sometimes too. the games are simple but that is half the fun.  easy to play and my five year old is entertained for hours
B0063IH60K|5.0|App works great. Fun for when you have some time to kill. Love the app it is really great for just a random time waster.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The update is fantastic! If you're having problems with punctuation you may need to update the language pack by going to languages and hitting your menu key and then update language pack.
B0081L391C|4.0|I ordered this in the middle of the night while working on the laptop while my wife slept next to me.<br />I woke her up laughing.<br /><br />We then watched it on Friday night - and she was laughing.<br /><br />While not a kid friendly / family movie -  It is a great movie for anyone who remembers the original show - and wants to laugh at how high school was, is today ... and how the shows from yesterday are still awesome.<br /><br />Great Movie - Great Date Night at home -  get a babysitter and stay in :-)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it everyday. I travel often and just add my standard locations into the app. It works great. Way better than other apps I have tried.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This whole album puts me in a good mood and I can listen to it start to finish.  The title track is my favorite, but they are all good.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|The menu buttons were not very responsive, but that was a minor issue compared to the frustration caused by item duplication in the levels. Several times I found the right item except in a very slightly different position, so it was wrong. I lost time due to uncertainty if it was the unresponsive controls, or if there was a duplicate item elsewhere that was the real solution.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I tried to reinstall the app to update facebook pic and it wont install again! it just says open and when I click open it does NOTHING!:(
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This DVD was absolutely brilliant and then some...if you love the irish sound, then this DVD is a must for your collection...can't wait until Celtic Woman tours Australia...S.E.N.S.A.T.I.O.N.A.L !!
B0035V35P8|5.0|This isn't ground-breaking and it certainly has it's cheesy moments, but it's a fun slash-fest with lots of action and an attractive main actor. I'm biased as a Rain fan, I'll admit, but I'm a fan of some actors and can't stand some of their movies. This one I can watch over and over and still have fun.<br /><br />One complaint is that this US version of the dvd is lacking the making-of features included in the Korean release.
B0000041XX|4.0|Carreras · Domingo · Pavarotti: The Three Tenors in Concert / Mehta is the first recording with the \\"Three tenors\\" and it was a concert in Italy conducted by Zubin Mehta. Here one gets to hear Carreras, Domingo and Pavorotti sing solo and together. The solo parts are amazing. The medley on the other hand is quite kitsch and sounds like opera for  the rabble. Still a quite enjoyable recording. Recommended. 4/5.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|Corgan insist that this record is nothing like Gish or Siamese Dream, but listening to it, how can you think that? Corgan tried to embrace his inner electronica for Adore rather than hiring a drummer, then he tossed a bunch of b-sides together and called them Machina,a record that went so nowhere the studio would only release one of two disk. Since then his solo and other band work has been banal and depressing with the last SP record being only mildly okay.<br /><br />Oceania is the middle child of Teargarden By Kaleidoscope (okay,I may have gotten that wrong but the title is something to that effect) and may be the result of impatience. What ever happened to 44 songs released as free downloads and 4 song ep's culminating in a massive box set? Oceania puts the tally at 21 songs, so about 1/2 way there.<br /><br />As for the music, well let's just say that we're never getting a follow-up to Melancholy. This is strictly mid tempo prog, it's a homage to the 70's rock that Corgan obviously loves so much. What is sorely missing and seems beyond Corgan's grasp the past decade is hooks. The songs are okay, but there's a lack of passion and fire in them. SP's future may not lie in trying to recapture the past, but it sorely needs a firm root in the hear and now. Corgan's become the Stephen King of the music world, he's prolific as all hell but his work is completely hit-or miss and sometimes it seems like he's just putting out his shopping-list because he can.<br /><br />There's a reason why people connected with songs like Disarm and Zero, the introspective nature, the raw emotion, the intensity. This is songwriting by the numbers, not from the deeper place those first three records came from. It's not even that this is a bad album, it's that it could have been so much better.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect but what a great book! I enjoyed the 2nd book the best but the setup was amazing. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Worth readi g!!
0955153077|5.0|I went to the Art Institute of Phoenix where there was many classes that covered Photoshop, several years later i decided to pick up the program to learn how to digitally paint, love the concept and wanted to know more.  I saw all the positive reviews for this book and i bought it. What most classes fail to cover is how to setup your photoshop workspace, like cache and scratch disk because the computers are already calibrated.  Right out of the box i was please with the quality of the book and the case that it came in.  The first chapter had me reconfiguring my system and had me pointed in the right direction vs. just opening the program up and mindlessly playing around with the options.  I am really looking forward to finishing this book, along with the other books in the entire 3D Total library, i feel they will help me take my artwork to a new level.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|wow this is really scary.i was trying this during thunder storm and was shaking. gonna have nightmares for months now. not recommended for the feint of heart. dont know if im ever gonna sleep again.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|i cant stop playing this game!! i dont have any problem with it. i dont see why it has so many bad reviews. I LOVE IT!!
B005LAIGRS|1.0|THIS ONE OF THE MOST BORING MOVIES, I'VE WATCHED IN A LONG TIME. IT STARTED AWFUL! IT'S BORING ME TO TEARS! I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING. I'M DISAPPOINTED.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I found the story to be interesting enough when I got past almost silly concept of the \\"rabbit-hole,\\" but this book was just SOOOOO LOOOOOOONG. I am not a book reviewer or critic; I just enjoy reading. I read on a Kindle and it was disheartening that I'd only make 1 or 2 % progress at each sitting. I think the story could have been told just as well in a more compressed fashion, but there is no doubt that Stephen King is a gifted author. I did think that the story dragged and dragged and then felt a bit rushed at the end. I was glad to finally be done with this book, but I also don't feel like it's time of my life that I'll never get back. I rate this book as just okay, and recommend it to readers who can dedicate a large amount of time to getting through it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw the movie and decided to read the books.  It was great. I did not want to put it down.  Could hardly wait to get to the next chapter.
