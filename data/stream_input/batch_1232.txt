1407109367|4.0|Catching Fire is the second book of the Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Set some six months after the end of the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are required to take part in the Victory Tour through each of the Districts to keep the power of the Capitol and the consequences of rebellion uppermost in the minds of the people. Relations between Katniss and Gale Hawthorne are strained. There are some rumours of uprisings in the other districts. The repulsive President Snow gives Katniss an ultimatum. Once again, fast-paced and filled with action, Collins leaves the reader wanting more. Can't wait for Mockingjay
B005EHNEDO|5.0|The more I listen to The Whole Love, the more it grows on me.  Somehow, the music manages to sound simultaneously catchy pop and hard-edged rock.  There's some sweet acoustic guitar picking, and some well-placed electric guitar freak-outs.  The lyrics are interesting, weird, poetic and thoughtful.  Can hear the Beatles influence on several tracks, but really this is unique and boundary-pushing music.<br /><br />Well done, Wilco.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is a wonderful story. It is truthful to the anxiety young people often feel about their sexuality. Brad Rowe, Trevor Wright, and Tina Holmes are totally AWESOME. The entire cast is excellent top to bottom (no pun intended). I loved this story and identified with all the characters. I am very happy I purchased this from AMAZON.COM. Thank you for the quality.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|needs a move to SD option, if soundhound can do it, you can too. other than that the app seems more complete
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie represent so much people, the struggle and the drive that Will Smith's character went through was so real. This movie is sad and inspirational at the same time. I wanted to cry but I can't (Joke). I highly recommend this movie, it's very touching.
B003XWEQ1G|1.0|Ridley Scott comes from a commercials background and hils films show this. He is the master of period detail, moody cinematography and precise art direction. His character development though is increasingly two dimensional and Cate Blanchett amongst others is wasted here. The plot is predictable and so simplified that you feel they should be wearing black and white hats. So to rent on Blu Ray and watch on lcd whilst using the computer, a good bet. To view anywhere with lesser picture quality or try and hold your attention, not really.

B000OSC3GM|5.0|This movie sends a powerful statement about what can happen when a country gets too powerful. A military overthrow is very possible in any country, any time. This is a movie that should be remembered. Nationalism or patriotism is very dangerous and when combined with fear and the control of the media, the masses can be made to believe anything.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The only complaint I have for the DVD I got was that the case was severely damaged. I will not buy from the particular user I bought this from again.  Other than that, the DVD works great. I'm a big Miyazaki fan, and this movie is amazing. <3
B000002L1L|5.0|Foolishly I listened to the critics hammer this album and decided it was a waste of time so it remained the only Deep Purple album I never bought.  I am now listening to it in 2011, 18 years after it came out and it's blooming amazing! I feel robbed of 18 years of this brightening up my listening. The title track is stunning, as are Anya, Ramshackle Man, A Twist is the Tail, Nasty Piece of Work and Solitaire. Absolute classic Deep Purple and they sound like they were recorded yesterday. Even though RB and IG fought like cat and dog and couldn't even be in the studio at the same time they sound like they're on fire on some of the tracks (middle section of Twist in the Tail is as good as anything they've ever done).  I'm going to see Deep Purple next month and will listen yet again to all the old classics while solid gold like this will be completely ignored. What a shame.  If this was a new album I'm convinced it would be a huge hit, it's far better than anything they've done since, even Purpendicular (and I love that album).
B004WPYNY8|5.0|From star to finish, all 12 songs are really good. I think this is their best album to date, it is a must have.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|\\"The Tree Of Life\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The impressionistic story of a Midwestern family in the 1950's following the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father. Jack finds himself a lost soul in the modern world, seeking answers to the origins and meaning of life while questioning the existence of faith. Through Terrence Malick''s signature imagery, we see how both brute nature and spiritual grace shape not only our lives as individuals and families, but all life.  The cast led by Brad Pitt (as Mr. O'Brien, who also produced the film), Brad Pitt (as Jack) & Jessica Chastain (as Mrs. O'Brien) is brilliant. The directing, story & screenplay by Terrence Malick is brilliant.  The music by Alexandre Desplat is brilliant. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is brilliant. The film editing by Hank Corwin, Jay Rabinowitz, Daniel Rezende, Billy Weber & Mark Yoshikawa is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler & Vicky Boone is brilliant. The production design by Jack Fisk is brilliant. The art direction by David Crank is brilliant. The set decoration by Jeanette Scott is brilliant. The costume design by Jacqueline West is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Dan Glass is brilliant. The special photographic effects supervised by Douglas Trumbull is brilliant.  This is a remarkably well-made film that is thought-provoking and brilliantly well-crafted. This is a stunning and intelligent achievement for director / writer Terrence Malick, who has directed and written one of his best films, if not, his best film of his career. Brad Pitt, Sean Penn & Jessica Chastain give terrific and well-crafted performances. This is the best film of this year and hopefully (I hope), it will be remembered during the awards season, as well. This is definitely a visually beautiful film.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|A film based on surrealistic absurdities of the type that seemed to be fairly common in the early part of Woody Allen's career (Zelig, The Purple Rose of Cairo and Play It Again Sam, to name only a few) allow an idealistic screenwriter to travel back in time to hang out with the Lost Generation in Paris. And while it's fun to hang out with Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Stein (Kathy Bates does a great Gertrude Stein, and Carey Stoll is outstanding in his capture of the cliched Hemingway delivery) as well as the surrealists Dali, Ray and Brunuel, it does get a bit tiring once again hearing that standard Woody Allen ironic and intellectual New York humour coming from the mouth of a young artist from Marseilles. This also makes the second \\"henpecked boyfriend finally figures out that his girlfriend is a bitch\\" type of film I've seen in a row, the other being The Hangover. Oh well.  At least Carla Bruni, the singer/songwriter supermodel and first lady of France, gets a nice cameo as a tour guide. Magnifique!
B005H5H3LW|4.0|In 1980 i use to run home from the bus stop, to make it in the door before 3 o'clock, so i could watch Starblazers. I LOVED that show, and thankfuly, it wasn't until i was an adult, that i saw all the flaws, but it doesn't matter. Thats the way i felt about the live action movie, it had flaws, but they didn't matter. The special effects were great, the design changes to some of the ships like the Cosmo Tigers fighter craft were subtle (Didn't like the big change to the Cosmo Zero though), the cast was good (even the sex changes), though i didn't know any of the actors, and i liked how they made Yuki (Nova) a pilot (plus she's hot). The main things i didn't like were how they changed the Gamilons, and that they made it to Iscandar and back, they could've ended the movie with them still on the mission and the movie wouldn't have felt so rushed. I didn't not like the ending, but the feeling of them rushing through the movie, like it was going too fast did bother me. Seeing that the original cartoon was so huge in Japan & america, i would've like to seen a mix of Japanese & american actors (it was the entire earth being destroyed after all). They could've had the characters bilingual. I've seen comments that the creators took alot from Battlestar Galactica (re-imagined), and they did, but it's only fair since the creators of BSG took things from Yamato/Starblazers. Look, in short there's a big difference in culture between America and Japan (obviously), so the Japanese actors mite not apeal to an american audience, or the subtitles, but it is a very good movie, and even though i was slightly disapointed with somethings, i'm glad i bought it, i'm glad i saw it, and i'm glad they made it..........Disney would have done alot worse.
B000002GBD|5.0|Opening track \\"Hair of the Dog\\" is the well-known \\"now you're messing with a son of a bitch\\" rocker, with its wicked riffs and gorgeous vocorder solo. Crafty! The madness continues with \\"Miss Misery\\" that is all rough guitar and abrasive, scratchy rock vocals, not to mention a groovy chorus. This song is as good as \\"Hair of the Dog\\"! The next track, \\"Love Hurts\\", has probably been heard by everyone, either in the original Everly Brothers version, if not the Gram Parsons version. Somehow this isn't the Nazareth I know, being a sweet ballad, but it's nice enough (too bad that, for so many, this is the only Nazareth song that they know). \\"Changin' Times\\" is a hooky rocker that alternates voice with guitar the same way \\"Razamanaz\\" does. It could be louder, but it's got guts. Nice take-out too. \\"Beggars Day\\" is also a gorgeous rocker with cool riffs and awesome Brian Johnson-like howling - is this a 1975 proto-AC/DC? \\"Rose in the Heather\\" is a short, mellow-ish instrumental that has some cool low-ebb guitar at the start to make you feel groovy. \\"Whiskey Drinking Woman\\" is a mid-tempo blues boogie, while \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\" is a long, bluesy glommer with psychedelic tinges, zooming on and on and on...

B004LWZW42|4.0|Not a bad little film that once again re-invents the complex relationship between Professor X and Magneto. The story digs up heroes and villains that I'm not familiar with, such as the one-dimensional baddie Azazel from a hyper dimension, but does its best to push the metaphor of the treatment of those who are \\"different\\" by mainstream society. James McAvoy is good as a young non-bald Professor X who is not yet wheelchair-bound, finding his way in the world, as is Michael Fassbender as Magneto, tormented by Nazi horrors. The plot is interesting - the Hellfire Club seeking to antagonise the US and the USSR into taking up war positions against each other orchestrates what would become the Cuban Missile Crisis. Some unexpected twists and turns, and some heroic speeches later, the world is safe from nuclear war... but are mutants safe from non-mutants and vice versa? Tune in next week for... X-Men: Second Class!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I sincerely hope this is the first in a very long series of books about the peculiar children. I couldn't put this book down, and now I can't stop thinking about the world created by the author, wondering what will happen to the children next. Please write more of these, Mr. Riggs!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I've always liked Colin Firth, ever since I saw him in Apartment Zero, but did get a bit impatient with him for making so many weird rom-coms. Now he's in fine form in the King's Speech where he plays stuttering regent Bertie, who eventually became George VI, which allows him to flex those acting chops and deliver an emotional role that covers events of great historical importance. The matter of speaking in a steady voice, taken for granted by so many of us, is given the full treatment here, as is his various family agonies, and the tumult of the times leading up to World War II. Of interest as well is that the film, despite being set in the 1930s, includes figures who are still a part of our modern lives, such as Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (also known as the Queen Mother, and played without her characteristic goofiness by a pleasantly restrained Helena Bonham Carter), and his daughter Elizabeth (also known as Queen Elizabeth II). Geoffrey Rush is, of course, Geoffrey Rush, and brilliant as Lionel Logue, an eccentric Australian speech therapist whose methods (nor even his very existence) are not at all trusted by the snooty upper crust that surround George VI; but he's a trooper and he carries on regardless, showing them their place as much as he possible can. The story of watching a stutterer overcome his handicap and give a speech that is important for the cause of freedom ultimately does make you want to jump up and cheer; the story of social inequality and intense family drama, along with national intrigue, is also there as a bonus if you want it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Ok, so I have now read all five of the \\"Ice and Fire\\" series and can say that I will not be picking up the sixth when/if it ever comes out. The first three books are some of my favorite titles of all time. A Clash of Kings is just all around a great story with great character. And the next was good, but you could tell it was beginning to fall off. And then you get to A Feast for Crows where the whole series falls apart. You read about a bunch of character you don't care about and wonder \\"Where the hell is Jon and Tyrion!\\" Well you finally get them back in this book, but you will be very disappointed with these characters. The book in whole just never catches steam. You read about people walking, and thinking about doing something, and sitting in rooms with each other talking about doing something and then by the end, none of it happens.<br />I know no review will make someone who has read all the books stop them from reading this one  I read a ton saying do not read this and look at me) but i figured I'd spare you the 15 bucks and tell you you are not missing anything.
031603441X|3.0|I thought I'd like this more than I did. The great Stone writes his life story, with the first 300 pages describing Keith's pre-heroin days, when he was growing up, becoming a choirboy, his introduction to guitar through grandfather Ernie, then growing disillusioned with the system and rebelling in art school and in music. He meets the Stones, first Mick Jagger, then Ian Stewart, then Brian Jones and the others. Many pages dwell on the type of music the band was listening to, a bit of bohemian poverty and then the early fame that they had and the madness that it brought with it, which included being nearly strangled and murdered by fans, and a wave of screaming from the ladies in the audience as Stones mania rivalled Beatlemania (the Stones, after all, were signed quickly by Decca executives still living down their decision to not sign the Beatles).<br /><br />Around page 300, Richards well and truly discovers heroin and the book goes into his drug use, as well as the escalating insanity of drug busts, interaction with Brian Jones, the birth-and-life-and-death of his relationship with Anita Pallenberg. There's rehabilitation and lots of cold turkey, and there's the death of people close to him such as Brian Jones, Gram Parsons, and his own young son Tara. There's also more about his life in Jamaica, where he fell in love with the local music scene, meeting Patti Hanson and re-starting his family with her, and the time in the 1980s when Mick Jagger's solo albums nearly broke up the Stones (and then there's a bit about Richards' own solo albums). Oh yeah, there are also plenty of descriptions of street fighting and guns, of which there never seems to be a lack of in Richards' life, the old pirate.<br /><br />As a book, it is told in a weird Keith-voice that is at once wise and rambling. Given that a true re-telling of everything Keith has lived through could easily fill 20 Lifes, there is going to be plenty that is left out, but I do feel that the book deals very little with his band-mates, with perhaps the exception of Charlie Watts and Ronnie Woods, who we can assume he's still very close to. Bill Wyman is hardly mentioned, and Brian Jones is also mentioned little, generally in disparagement (over his loss in interest in the Stones, his wastedness, and his treatment of Anita Pallenberg). Mick Jagger is mentioned somewhat, but probably not enough, and Mick Taylor isn't mentioned much either. Ian Stewart and saxophonist Bobby Keys (who was born on the same day in 1943, but on different continents) are in the book plenty. He does describe quite thoroughly his various busts and his relationship with the law, even going into the support he got from the White House in the aftermath of the 1977 heroin bust in Toronto, as well as some help from the Pineapple King of Hawaii during one customs incident there. The Exile on Main Street sessions are described relatively well, at least, probably because of the unique way that it was recorded in the house that Keith rented in the south of France, plus the fact that it was their first written in tax exile (and also widely considered their best album). The recording of most other albums is mentioned in an almost cursory way. Being Keith, he doesn't go about telling his story in a very straight forward way either, and often lets others tell the story - Marlon, Bobby, Jimmy - quoting long anecdotes from others, or reproducing from books that others have written.<br /><br />Another area that's treated in greater fullness is Richards' apprenticeship to music, covering his first music lessons with his grandfather, getting into Richards' discovery of American blues, to his adventures in black nightclubs in the US south on their first tour there, to his discovery of alternate tunings, five-string guitars, and the messianic vibes of Jamaica. While Richards has probably collaborated with too many great musicians to mention, he does write a bit about his work with Chuck Berry.<br /><br />The book also has two sections of photos, showing the Stones more regularly than they appear in writing, plus also great pics of Keith in the sixties and seventies, as well as pics of Keith and Paul McCartney, with Tom Waits, and with Johnny Depp on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean 3, and assorted family pictures. The book also has an excellent index.tones more regularly than they appear in writing, plus also great pics of Keith in the sixties and seventies, as well as pics of Keith and Paul McCartney, with Tom Waits, and with Johnny Depp on the set of Pirates of the Caribbean 3, and assorted family pictures.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|The game runs fine until Amazon app store opens in the background. The game freezes and I have to reset it. I have been able to play 2 levels in a row at the most.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I only saw half of this film, but I was very happy to take it in for its portrayal of the very strange Mark Zuckerberg, the weird moral dilemmas that the development of Facebook created for a court of law, and of a handful of slimy Ivy League snobs. All of this makes it totally appropriate that it's a film by dark director David Fincher, with a soundtrack by the equally-sinister Trent Reznor. When I first heard that Fincher, known for making violent films like Alien 3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and Zodiac (okay, maybe Benjamin Buttons doesn't fit that bill entirely), I thought it was pretty strange departure from his oeuvre, and that his adaptation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo would be a return to form; now I wonder if The Social Network is actually the film that returned him to form.

B000LB7G00|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone that needs a basic 3d mouse for 3d software. Not a lot of whistles and bells, but more than enough to help aid in the design process.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I wasn't sure about buying this product because of the design in the back, but finally after reviewing a bunch of other choices on clear cases I decided to purchase this case for a white iPhone 4S. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  The case is clear and sturdy enough to protect your device. Some people might not like the circle shapes on the back, but although it looks nice in black iPhone 4S (my husband purchased one for his black iPhone 4S) in my opinion looks better if your iPhone is white. The slots and openings allow you to have easy access to the buttons. The tan Amazon logo on the lower part of the case is minimally invasive and you will not notice it much. The only minor issue I had was when trying to connect my iPhone to the speakers of my car through an audio cable, the thickness of the material might prevent a good insertion of it, so you just need to make sure the plug is inserted or you will hear an annoying static coming out of the speakers.  The case comes with a nice screen protector that proved to be the easiest one I have ever installed. Starting with my first iPhone 3GS and both generations of iPads, every single screen protector I have come accross have been nightmarish to install. This one will just easily cling to the screen and the squeegee provided helps you get any bubbles out. Two words of advice: 1) clean the surface you will use with a damp cloth prior to installation to avoid dust getting between the screen and the screen protector; 2) Install the shield before installing the case (obvious, but needs to be mentioned just in case).   The installation of the case is not that easy because the material used is not a soft silicon. The good thing is that it protects your gadget and once installed the edges on the screen will not peel off the corners of your screen protector as other products. Also, please consider that you will not be able to dock your device with this case, but the charging cable will connect without issues.   Bottom line: I would recommend this product to iPhone 4S users, specially if the device is white. Good quality for the price and in addition to protecting your new gadget, you can show it off too ;)

1586487981|5.0|I think this is a very important book for anyone who is interested in improving the life of the very poor around the world.  It recounts the results of a series of double-blind experiments in several different environments in which people with an idea of how to help improve life tried two or more variations in different, randomly chosen ways or villages.  The results have taught those who read the book some very useful lessons about what works and what does not.  Along the way, the reader learns some useful lessons about how human decision-making really works.  I recommend this book highly, and have been giving copies to many friends who are interested int he subject.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I don't know why I didn't go and see this while it was playing in theater's! I LOVED the movie. It was funny, and had a pretty fair message in there as well.

B002C6A6FY|5.0|So much has already been written about this movie I won't bore you with a long diatribe.  This movie is required viewing.  It is a part of pop culture reference.  If you haven't seen it you won't catch references in hundreds of other movies and even in standard conversation (depending on the age group).  So many phrases and tropes came out of this very creative original film.  Just watch it.  You will be glad for the time you invested.  Totally enjoyable.

B00008WT5C|5.0|Although it didn't sell much when released in 1977, Let There Be Rock is the first of several classic albums from AC/DC. This is raw, dirty, sweaty, no nonsense rock n' roll performed with vigor and zeal. This is also one of the few discs in that the first two songs are the least memorable ones on the album. And that's not to say that \\"Go Down\\" and \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" aren't great because they are. However, the album's strong rep comes on the next track. Featuring a blistering riff from Malcolm Young, a great story lyric from Bon Scott, and wicked guitar solos from Angus Young, the title song is one of the all-time great anthems. Not to be outdone is the ode to big women called \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", another enduring track with a memorable riff that the band still plays live. \\"Problem Child\\" is another great anthem while \\"Overdose\\" is a slow burner that may have been the closest the band ever came to a ballad. \\"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\\" and \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\" are two more great tracks with riffs galore that still appear in their live shows. Certainly one of their best five albums (I have it at #3 behind Back in Black and Highway to Hell), Let There Be Rock is a must own for any fan of great `70s hard rock.

B000002KIT|5.0|In the era of the live album, Thin Lizzy's Live and Dangerous stands out as one of the best. Recorded when the band were at their peak, Phil Lynott's soulful voice and charisma are on full display while the band plays like a well oiled machine. The track listing is pretty balanced although there is a large emphasis on their classic Jailbreak album which makes sense. The crowd is very much involved with this recording as well, at times sounding like a fifth band member. Most of the band's best tracks up to this point are here with \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\" and maybe \\"Bad Reputation\\" being the lone exceptions. Melodic rockers like \\"Rosalie\\" and \\"Southbound\\" sound much livelier in this setting while \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" and \\"Baby Drives Me Crazy\\" explores the band's underrated R&B side. Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson's dual guitar lines are great throughout and bring even more bite to the heavy metal tracks such as \\"Sacrifice\\", \\"Warrior\\", \\"Emerald\\", and \\"Suicide\\". \\"Jailbreak\\" is a hard driving opener while an emotional \\"The Cowboy Song\\" runs right into an explosive version of their timeless hit single \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\". Other highlights include \\"Sha La La\\" (complete with a Brian Downey drum solo), \\"Johnny the Fox Meets Jimmy the Weed\\", a long bluesy \\"Still in Love with You\\", and a scorching version of \\"The Rocker\\" that closes the album. One of the great hard rock live albums, Live and Dangerous is an excellent document of the greatness that was Thin Lizzy. Highly recommended.

B0000630BT|4.0|Judas Priest made a strong comeback with Painkiller. They tried to go pop/metal on Turbo and it didn't fly while the slightly harder Ram It Down had a lot of mediocre songs and may have been their worst album. Painkiller finds the Priest rejuvenated. New drummer Scott Travis would be a shot in the arm as his powerful drumming made Priest go back to being a heavy band. All of the songs here are all solid and the performances do bring a lot of them up a notch. \\"One Shot at Glory\\" and \\"All Guns Blazing\\" are strong anthems while \\"A Touch of Evil\\" and \\"Night Crawler\\" are more cerebral and work very well.  \\"Metal Meltdown\\", \\"Leather Rebel\\", and the title track find the band going speed metal and they do a great job as \\"Painkiller\\" finds Rob Halford giving one of his finest vocal performances.  While there isn't a classic tune here ala \\"Living after Midnight\\" or \\"Victim of Changes\\", Painkiller is a strong album from Priest that still sounds great and they haven't made anything this good since.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Many have blasted this boxed set - well, the way some of the movies were not changed to suit them.  Get over it!<br /><br />These are still some of the best movies ever done - period.  They have a story.  They have heroes and bad guys.  They have fast vehicles.  Dangerous situations.  Crashes.  And there is a moral to the tale.<br /><br />So there are shortcomings - big deal.  Take the series in its entirety - not as six different movies.<br /><br />I enjoy sitting down and slipping one of the dvd's in and relaxing - you should too.  Stop worrying about what Lucas is doing or not doing - see the movies for what they are.  Remember the glass is half full!  : )

Sandra Bullock is brillant in the role of an idealistic, activist lawyer who goes to work for him as part of a bargain to save a community center. Their romantic chemistry is good, and their comedic chemistry, amazing. It's a lighthearted, clever, feel good movie that never gets stale.

Bluray won, Apple won, deal with it and give us uniform formats.  I hope WB doesn't do this to Deathly Hollows Part 2.
B005MSD75U|5.0|This movie will make you laugh. And, to all you wannbe movie critics, that are writing entire books and spoling the movie, remember what you are watching, a clean comedy. This is a great movie to watch with your wife and children. It is clean, no cursing, nudity or drug use. Just clean and funny, which is very hard to find in todays media market. Also, the synopsis is misleading, the animals show him nothing about mating it was more about how they would win the girl.
B003DZX44I|5.0|You read that right.  Classic Disney movies age very well.  My roommates made fun of me at first for picking this up, as well as The Lion King, but they sat and watched the movie with me last Saturday night so bully to them.  It also contains a never before seen musical number that made me do a double take.  I had no idea there were deleted scenes in Beauty and the Beast!
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|not only is it difficult to tell the pieces apart, I don't any money for passing Go and it does not announce when I sink a battleship.<br /><br />I have no idea what game the single star thinks they are playing, but for checkers this is a decent app.

0446585025|1.0|First, I am a HUGE fan of Ellen.  I've loved all her sitcoms, I watch her show all the time, and even saw her in person, and next to Kathy Griffin, was my absolute favorite stand up act ever.  That being said, this book comes off as something she threw together real quick, knowing everyone would buy it up, and she could make a bunch of money.  It's really the same type of humor she does on her show, 'So, I was driving to work, thinking about writing this book, with the top down, and my convertible top up.'  That kinda stuff is great for her show, but in a book?  No thanks. I was hoping for some funny stories about some guests on her show.  Maybe some information about her, that we didn't know.  Maybe even some heartfelt stuff about the stuff she does with animals.  Nope.  And tons of chapters in this book are just pointless.  One is for the people listening to the audio book, so she decides to give them funny sounds to enjoy, and then just types those sounds for those reading.  One chapter goes on and on and on about how it's the longest chapter in the book, so be prepared, and maybe come back to it later, if you're busy.  Seriously, 5 pages warning you it's long.  Then makes a one sentence point, and says, \\"Wow, I guess it wasn't that long after all.\\"  I couldn't wait to read it, but quit 2/3 of the way through.  And I never quit reading a book.

B004W48QFG|5.0|I have been using this app for a corporate server environment as well as personal use and it is hands down the best RDP app out there.    You do NOT need a client app on the target machine (like many others out there, ie. Teamviewer) but you may need some configuration on your router, PC or firewall to connect to clients.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read this book when I was in 5th grade or so, and found the story captivating. Perfect society, perfect world, everyone is fair, everyone is equal. Discuss our feelings, speak concisely and nicely about others. Fear, poverty, violence, and the bitter realities of the real world don't exist. Except for Jonas. Jonas is given the burden of holding these memories, so that he can help the council formulate educated decisions for how they should properly moderate their perfect society.<br /><br />This book evokes so many emotions, and is hands down one of my favorite books still to this day. I read it countless times when I was younger, lent it to friends and family members. I went through two physical copies of the book, and when I started reading on a Kindle I figured it'd be an excellent way to get myself back into the spirit of reading. I couldn't have been more pleased with my decision to pick this one up first.<br /><br />It's a fairly simple read, but the concept, depth, story, and feelings inside the book are very complex. My girlfriend is in the process of reading it now, upon my recommendation. You should do the same :)
B0006L0LOS|2.0|It was awful, I really wanted to see how it all ended so I put up with the smooth, light jazz/soft porn Muzak intertwined with some bad grrl tunes, the horrid acting and the cheesy lines and goofy computer FX to see the payoff and now I feel so ashamed, ripped off and dirty.<br /><br />Halle did look gorgeous, for sure she's one of the loveliest women in H-Wood, but B. Bratt is absolutely awful. I don't like him anyhow. Sharon Stone is Sharon Stone & there's nothing to be done about that.<br /><br />I'm gonna go fester in my guilt now.

B0055D3EOG|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time today.  This is by far the creepiest movie I've seen in a LONG time.  Just like with many scary movies, I didn't have much hope for this one when I first turned it on, but I figured $3.99 was ok to rent it if I didn't like it.  However, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the story line and how it grabbed at you from the first moment.  I would have liked a slower lead in to the \\"ghost\\" part of the story, but still, they did a pretty decent job.  Overall, I'd recommend it :)
B002Q4GIKE|5.0|Had to watch this movie for a music appreciation college class.  Before watching it I was not looking forward to it and thought a 1984 movie about a composer could not be that great. Wow was I wrong. The movie has a great story line, (lots of liberty taken by writers and director here - not an actual true historical rendering of Mozart's end of life), and the music is just awesome!  The work of Mozart runs throughout the story and is interjected into scenes just beautifully. Not to give too much away - I actually   had a few tears in a couple of places. Unfortunately my copy of the dvd had a defect which allowed me to watch the movie and hear the music score but I could not hear the actors speaking and had to watch it with subtitles. I am getting this copy exchanged and plan to watch it again.  I would definitely recommend this movie.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|I should have read the one star reviews before renting this movie. What was Brad Pitt thinking when he played a role in this move??? When you think \\"Brad Pitt,\\" this kind of movie does not come to most people's minds (certainly not mine). Talk about plotless, confusing and boring. I had to fast forward and the only scene that caused me to pause for a moment were the dinosaurs - I was hoping that the movie got better. I just gave up and not bothered watching the rest of the movie. $3.99 down the drain.

B005QYKE2Y|1.0|Tried Amazon's video streaming for the first time for Transformers via the TV, but sadly it did not work.

B0051QIGP4|4.0|Personally, I couldn't wait until Lady Gaga released this album. Hearing the song \\"Born this way\\" got me really pumped for the album itself. And I have to say, Gaga didn't fail to deliver. She includes a wide variety of musical styles, such as opera, mariachi, pop, rock-n-roll, and even delivers a country infused \\"You and I\\", which is one of the album's strongest points. With killer hooks and catchy rhythms, it's impossible to dislike every song on the album, there's something in it for everybody. She even uses different languages including spanish, french, and some german(it's more like german gibberish, but it still works). Now, the tracks themselves are good, but the way they are ordered could have been done better. A perfect example would be placing \\"Electric Chapel\\" after \\"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\", the album tends to be repetitve and kind of redundant. But don't let this distract you from the high quality of this album, and I'm not just saying this because I'm a Gaga fan, it's my unbiased opinion. When people say this album is all hype, don't believe them, or else you will miss out on a truly great piece of work.

B000002ITM|3.0|Testament are one of the best and most loved Bay Area Thrash Metal bands, bands from around San Francisco that started making music in the 1980s and have influenced countless artists with their thrashing riffs, twin guitar solos and memorable vocals.<br /><br />While their first four albums were all straight up classic Thrash Metal albums, all varying in their levels of melody, speedy, complexity and heaviness; their fifth album, 1992's The Ritual found the band making their one and only attempt to streamline their sound and make a more commercial record, in the same way that launched a few Thrash bands into megastar status and which killed a great deal more bands almost for good.<br /><br />The Ritual was the last album to feature the classic line-up of Chuck Billy on Vocals, Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson on guitar, Greg Christian on Bass and Louie Clemente on Drums; it was initially rather successful for the band, and may indeed have introduced a lot of people to Testament in the 1990s, but now isn't often seen as a highlight of the band's catalogue in the same way that their thrashier material is.<br /><br />A fair few Testament fans out and out hate this record, so be warned of this fact before listening so that you don't go in blind, expecting another New Order or The Legacy. When listened to with an open mind however, there is still a lot of worthy and interesting material present on The Ritual, and it isn't altogether deserving of all the hate it can sometimes get.<br /><br />No one could accuse the album of not being varied enough. `Electric Crown' and `Let Go Of My World' are Testament's attempt to follow Metallica and Megadeth's simplified, melodic, Thrash-meets-hard-Rock efforts of the time. `So Many Lies' is a six minute long, repetitive mid tempo number. The Title-Track is a seven minute progressive number and `Return To Serenity' is another track in the spirit of the previous album's semi-ballad `The Legacy,' while `Deadline' is a very melodic and commercial number with an almost hair metal feel at times.<br /><br />Throughout the whole album, there are lots of interesting riffs and impressive guitar solos as always from Testament, only this time the record is both a lot more multi-faceted than before, while still remaining musically stimulating.<br /><br />If you want to listen to Testament to hear Thrash Metal, as is only natural, then this isn't really a record you should pick up. If however, you like Chuck Billy's cleaner voice, lots of guitar solos and don't mind if the tempo dips more often than usual then pick up a copy of The Ritual and enjoy this one unusual moment in the band's career.l feel at times.

B003QSOE0U|4.0|This movie gets a bad rap, but it's really pretty good! There's plenty of great action, including the bombing sequence which is very well-done. And there's a decent romance, though the acting by Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck leaves much to be desired...
B005IY3CMQ|2.0|I've listened to this c.d. over and over with good intentions... and I can't figure out what direction they were headed, and what market they intending it for, (it's somewhat self-indulgent).<br />  If possible I will have to listen quite a few more times so if it can \\"grow on me\\".

B005C7SXMS|4.0|The movie takes place in Wales. After missing the first joke, I added the English subtitles. The story is told in first person by school boy Oliver Tate who spends time daydreaming. His vivid imagination is humorous. Oliver has fantasies about Jordana, another semi-outcast. She uses Oliver to make her former boyfriend jealous. Jordana has eczema and likes to set fires. Oliver's mother is a paranoid who believes her tongue is too big for her mouth. Dad is a boring marine biologist who gives Oliver love advice, claiming that if you rip your vest open in front of a woman, you can get a positive response. Oliver believes his mom is having an affair with the neighbor Graham, her former boyfriend, who is a &#34;ninja psychic.&#34;<br /><br />Like too many indies, after they create wonderful quirky characters, the film moves to a less than spectacular climax scene and equally sub-par ending with lame music to make you feel good. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />F-bomb, sex talk. No Nudity.

B005ZKYXZI|4.0|**Contains unintended plot spoilers by making comparisons to movies they stole from hence my title \\"Reel Steal\\".**<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is a robot fighter and doesn't win much. He owes a lot of money as he doesn't pay up on his losing bets. When his ex dies, she leaves behind, Max his 11 year old estranged son. He sells the \\"rights\\" of parenthood over to his ex's sister...but here's the catch. The new parents are going to Italy and they need Hugh to take care of his son for the summer until they get back. Got the plot figured out yet? Yawn.<br /><br />While this sounds similar to \\"Paper Moon\\", Dakota Goyo is no Tatum O'Neill. Jackman comes across as Clint Eastwwood light. Jackman and Goyo were unconvincing in their roles, doing little more than reading lines. On the other hand, Evangeline Lilly as Hugh's girlfriend, gives us a good performance, what little we see of her. At times the movie was more like \\"Short Circuit\\" than \\"Rocky\\" demonstrating its appeal to children. Electronic money transfers apparently have disappeared in this age and everything is done in cash, making it easier to get beat up and robbed.<br /><br />In the stadium runway, Goyo gets tossed a t-shirt aka \\"Mean\\" Joe Greene commercial style. The robot special effects were fantastic. But what really made the movie unbelievable was that the 11 year old hates hamburgers. There is an underground amateur boxing circuit where robots box. I liked this aspect of the movie as it has quirky characters and that \\"Thunder Dome Mad Max\\" aspect to it. Unfortunately there wasn't enough of it. They could of made all kind of odd bots with weird owners, but opted to have Jackman recite dull cliche lines instead. The climax not only reminds you of a \\"Rocky\\" rope-a-dope episode, they also stole lines from the film. While the special effects were great, the script was pure plagiarism, an \\"F\\" for originality.<br /><br />Good big screen production. No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. 5 stars for preteens, 4 stars for teens, 3 stars for mature adults.tars for mature adults.

0545259088|3.0|I really, really hated to have to review this one. I quickly learned that this final book did not seem to follow the same captivating and suspenseful read that I had experienced in the previous books. The story of Sam and Grace continues and seems to find its closure, but it was not the closure that allows a reader to feel satisfied with the resolutions. Being that I absolutely love Maggie Stiefvater; I must conclude with saying that this was not her best work and does not truly show the depth of her talented abilities.
B004ULNJIU|3.0|\\"Blitz\\" is a UK crime thriller starring Jason Statham (\\"The Transporter\\") as Detective Sergeant Tom Brant, a tough cop with a vigilante streak. With recently-transferred Sergeant Porter Nash (Paddy Considine), Brant hunts down a serial cop killer who calls himself \\"Blitz.\\"   As far as the story goes, \\"Blitz\\" adds nothing to the \\"rogue cop\\" genre. The film looks like a belated answer to Clint Eastwood movies, with none of the latter's skills necessary to get the viewer involved with the characters. The narrative is often flat, and the pace is not so much as \\"fast\\" as \\"rushed.\\"  \\"Blitz\\" attempts to include so many things in its short running time that few of them are really interesting. Issues such as media responsibility and moral ambiguity are barely touched upon, while the film's content clearly raises questions about them. As a suspense film, the identity of the killer is revealed to viewers early on, which in itself is not a bad thing at all, but the process of the police investigation is rather sketchy and dull.   \\"Blitz\\" could have made for a more compelling thriller. The London locations serve well as a backdrop against which the thin story is told. Paddy Considine turns in a fine performance as a by-the-book officer with a past. And, well, Jason Statham is always good at being Jason Statham. The two leads are very effective.  But those episodes involving a newspaper reporter Harold Dunlop (David Morrissey), who is approached by the killer, are underdeveloped. Also, the subplot about a former undercover police officer Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton) goes nowhere. Almost no attempts are made to make them interesting.  \\"Blitz\\" is a nice throwback to the classic movies like \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"French Connection,\\" but lacks the charisma and energy of Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman and their movies.
B001HNE3NO|1.0|I really wanted to like this book.  It had good reviews and it was made into a movie.  However, I thought the author's writing style was so annoying that occasionally I found myself laughing out loud. Because this book dealt with some of the horrors and consequences of Nazi concentration camps, you can only magine how poorly I found the writing to end up laughing.  The worst part of her style was the persistent use of questions.  On every page there was some character asking questions to herself - usually an adult but sometimes a child.  And the questions were fairly simplistic such as \\"Where is the train going? Who is driving the train? Where will we put our luggage? Who will take our ticket? Is there a place to get a snack?\\" These are slight exaggerations - but only slight!  There were a couple of twists in the plot but not many.    This is the first review I've done for Amazon - that's how strongly I felt about this book.  I cannot recommend it.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Marvel movies rarely get better than Captain America: The First Avenger.  The last stand-alone film from Marvel Studios to set up next year's mega-super hero opus The Avengers, Captain America stars Chris Evans (who funny enough played The Human Torch in the two forgettable Fantastic Four films) as the titular star-spangled hero, who takes on the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) during World War II in an effort to stop his nefarious scheme and his evil Hydra organization.  What makes Captain America so enjoyable is the fact that director Joe Johnston (The Wolfman, The Rocketeer) injects so much heart and soul into the otherwise pedestrian script, and the fact that Evans himself is surprisingly enjoyable in the title role without falling into the kind of cockiness/self-referential performance that often accompanies his roles.  Hugo Weaving is great, and Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as well, but in the end we all know what this really is meant for: The Avengers.  And by the time the end credits roll, you'll be salivating for it like never before.  All in all, Captain America: The First Avenger is a supremely enjoyable and just plain awesome superhero film that is more than worth your time and attention, and it does a fantastic job at making us all forget about that early 90s schlock-fest with the rubber-earred suit.
B004LWZW42|2.0|Fassbender was great as Magneto - as was the plot line that he had.  It made me wish they had stuck with only making the Magneto Origins movie.  Every time he was off the screen, the movie stopped short.  All the other actors didn't nearly measure up - McAvoy might have if Xavier was better written.  Magneto was the only truly fleshed out character in the entire movie and Xavier's development fell short.  You were just supposed to buy into the fact that he's a goodie goodie and doing right just \\"because\\".    Aside from the acting complaints from the X Babies (the actor that played Beast was the best of the worst) and the fact that the Hellfire Club was so poorly done (January Jones was completely and utterly useless, I've never seen a woman run around in so much lingerie and yet be so completely un-sexy at the same time).  They should have opted to switch out the Hellfire Club plotline with a Mr. Sinsiter/Nathaniel Essex plotline.  For those that aren't familiar with X-Men characters outside the movies - Mr. Sinister is a human geneticist hell bent on gene manipulation and mutants.  He's from the late 19th century but due to experiments done on himself, he's manipulated his own DNA and is pretty much immortal and impervious to pain.  He also looks just like Kevin Bacon.  Which is what Bacon should have been.  It would've fit into the whole concept of the torturing obsessive geneticist Nazi doctor that they turned Sebastian Shaw into.  Shaw, in the comics, is pretty much Lex Luthor but with mutant powers.  He can absorb energy and then direct it back in brute physical force - he can't BLOW up things with it or use energy blasts.  Why the movies didn't think it was enough to stick to the physical nature of his powers, is beyond me.  Alas, back to Mr. Sinister - he is also obsessed with Cyclops and Jean Grey - which would've tied in GREAT to the future plot line where Professor X starts recruiting mutants for his school.  It also would have worked for the film for Magneto's revenge plot line as well.  Why on earth people get paid MILLIONS of dollars to execute and perform such a craptacular plotline with unbelievably horrible dialogue at times, is baffling to me.  Oh yeah and did I mention that the black guy dies first?  Yeah, that's right. The only black mutant in the movie...dies first. Cliche.  I'd recommend seeing this film ONLY so you can understand how bad it is at times.  It's disappointing because a GOOD movie is in there - but it got completely buried alive under the horrible writing and plot. Also, continuity flaws abound, because while it's a reboot - it isn't - and while it is not a sequel/prequel - it apparently is.  If the film was at least a stand alone complete 100% reboot, then I could perhaps forgive some of it.  But that's not the case.  And while the older X-Men movies do have flaws - some are very glaring - it at least didn't have a precedent to compete against.  That's what's so bad about this film in the end.  It could have been AMAZING and it could have truly been \\"The Dark Knight\\" of X-Men films, yet all it becomes is a movie about a bunch of sort of angsty teens that really aren't that angsty and about two guys that are pretty much trying to do the same thing - one of which has clear reasons for his motives, the other is just apparently a blind optimist.  So with that said - can they please just do a TRUE X-Men film...... one with the REAL first class of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Angel, Beast, and Ice Man?  Is that at ALL on the freaking scope of anyone out there?

Or pick it up on the marketplace for free and deal with the ads (which aren't that bad, really).
B004JK61K0|4.0|I mostly was looking for a mail ap that would allow me to select multiple messages to mark as read. The stock ap only lets you select and delete multiple messages. K9's ability to do this wasn't immediately obvious to me, but after poking around (literally!) a bit I discovered that if you tap the small tab to the left of a message it will select it and pop up a menu allowing you to \\"mark as read/unread\\", \\"delete\\", \\"star\\", or deselect (in that order) the selected message(s). (Oh! Just discovered you can set it to always show the \\"multiselect checkboxes\\", though I like the hidden tabs more, now that I know they are there!)<br /><br />I do wish that there were a way to create folders for imap accounts. I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the protocol or the program, however. Having the ability to set up filters on incoming mail would be nice, too.<br /><br />Oh, and it would be lovely if the \\"dark\\" theme carried over into the message view. For me the account, folder, and message list view are all lovely and dark, but the actual message view is light with dark text. Maybe it would be nice if we could set our own text and background colors!<br /><br />Overall, I like what is being done and look forward to seeing where this project goes!

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE Em fan and I have been his entire career. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with \\"The Re-up\\". It wasn't him and it didn't sound like him. Then a few years later he came out with \\"Relapse\\" which was OKAY at best. I only really cared for \\"3 a.m.\\" and \\"My Mom\\" on the album although a few other songs were okay. Well then I heard that he was coming out of retirement and creating a new album, so, naturally I went and bought it and all I could say was \\"WOW\\". He's off drugs, he's clean, he's sober, AND HE'S BACK! I don't like song #4 on the CD and that is about it. The album is arguably his best yet. My favorite song and in my opinion the best is track #14-Almost Famous\\". I mean Jesus he uses the word \\"antidisestablishmintariansim\\" AND IT WORKS! I wanted to go out and fight someone after I listened to it. There are very few artists that I follow through-out their whole career because they tend to decline or become \\"bleh\\" over a period of time but not this man. He has turned back into that lyrical genius that fans love and haters despise. In song #2 he admits that he screwed up and he says he's sorry to all his fans and wants to thank them for standing by him and that he's past all his mistakes and he says that his last 2 CD's were (expletives that I can't say on Amazon). You rarely, if ever see his \\"Slim shady\\" personality this is almost all Eminem. I'm glad I remained a fan of him through his difficulties and suicide contemplations. This is Eminem is his rawest form. HE'S BACK!
B005J0VPNC|2.0|Had the app on my iphone and had to get it for my new Android phone. Read the other reviews for how cool the app is!  However...  Two things that really bug me about this app and made me give it two stars:  1. You can't set the resolution of the photo. I have an 8 megapixel camera on my phone and the largest image file this app saves is 1024x768. I thought maybe you can open a file take with the standard camera app and then apply the effects to it and save the full res sketch photo. Nope, it still down saves it to 1024x768.  2. You can't tell it to save pictures taken in the app to an SD card on the phone. I always goes to internal memory.
0446547654|5.0|for a guy to write a romance novel nicholas does very well and I look forward to the next novel. i like stories of young lovers that reunite 10-20 years later and fall back in love such as this story did. however i did not like the ending cuz  i  was not prepared for it. as i was reading it i made a loud gasp and my son was wondering what happened to me!! i like romance novels cuz there's always happy endings but not this one. the beginning of the story was good amanda and dawson were called back home to attend the funeral of their friend tuck. by coincidence she is having trouble with her marriage,her husband is  an alchoholic and causes her son to be seriously injured in a car crash, that was traumatic enough but, oh no,he had to make it worse!!!  i don't want to spoil the result but  i'm sure you can figure it out. and i just found out it's being made into a movie. i didn't see the notebook or last song but i'll definitely watch the best of me and i'll just bring along a heavy duty handkerchief with me!!

B0056BU3I2|5.0|really enjoyed the movie. hands down the best of the franchise so far. over the top and action packed! what more can you ask for? cannot wait for the next one!
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|I never heard about [REC] until early last year when someone on a message board for 28 Days Later suggested it. I watched it a few days later, and recommended it to all of my friends who, like me, were getting bored of horror movies doing the same things these days. That's not to make [REC] sound like it's something completely original, but it certainly was a breath of fresh air in this era of torture movies like Saw, Hostel and many others. This movie does everything right, and really is one of the best 'found footage' movies I've ever seen. If you're one of the people who were disappointed with The Blair Witch Project for not showing you much to be afraid of, [REC] might be more up your alley, because it sure as heck doesn't hold back. Just keep in mind that this movie is originally in Spanish, something that a lot of reviewers apparently take personally. Reading a movie?! Preposterous! Oh the memories of working in a movie store are coming back to me...  Angela is the hostess for a show called While You're Asleep, which covers various jobs and events that take place while the people of Barcelona are sleeping. She, with her cameraman Pablo, are covering a local fire station, and things aren't very exciting. They trudge around showing the firemen doing incredible things like eating dinner, sleeping and showing off their suits. Suddenly they get an emergency call for a woman trapped in her apartment and they take off. Angela and Pablo go along with them to the building, and the few residents that live there are all waiting in the hallway. It's in the early AM hours, so tension is a bit high, especially when police have the area surrounded for some odd reason. Angela and Pablo follow a few men to the trapped woman's room, and it's obvious that something's wrong. She attacks and bites one of them, and everyone else rushes out. Things take a huge turn for the worse when the building is sealed and no one's letting the residents know what's going on. Even the special agent who's supposed to give orders is left in the dark for the most part. A virus is spreading, and in such a confined area, with limited lights and no way out...things don't look very good for our reporter.  A lot happens as soon as Angela and Pablo enter the apartment, and the movie moves at such a fast pace that you can't believe it's over when it is. There were no boring parts, all of the actors were genuine in their delivery and expressions, and the infection plot, while definitely overused now, is at least a little more interesting than every other zombie movie or game that comes out on a monthly basis. Since the movie's all filmed on Pablo's camera, you're put right into the situation, stuck with him and Angela as they try to find safety in the slim apartment building. None of his shots are pointless, and there's always something happening that he's capturing on film, moving the story along at the perfect pace. It also helps to have Manuela Velasco, who's very easy on the eyes, in nearly every shot. The characters never really make any stupid moves and react realistically, and I had a lot of sympathy for everyone here, which is rare. There's no self-centered jerk who you want to get killed off, no annoying would-be leader who makes poor decisions, none of the usual stereotypes in horror movies. Kills are relatively quick but still gruesome to see with little CG work. In fact, nearly everything here looks to be done with good ol' makeup. There's nothing bad I can say about the movie except for that I didn't care for the ending. Granted, [REC]2 came out not too long ago, but I would've liked a little more substance to how this one ended.  Yeah, there's still no US blu-ray of this movie, so I'm stuck reviewing the dvd, which isn't bad. In fact, since the movie's shot on small video cameras, it won't look much better on blu-ray anyway. The picture quality is great for what it is, but still hard to say anything bad about given the style. You get some 'errors' in thepicture here and there, but they're obviously intentional. The audio's done in an effective 5.1 Surround mix, with screams and howls going on all over the place and audio 'errors' exactly where they should be when something happens to the camera or microphone. The dvd that I watched only had audio in Spanish with optional English subtitles. If you want an English dub, you'll have to wait, or just go with Quarantine (oh come on, it's the SAME MOVIE).  The special features are a bit lacking, but what's here is still nice. You get a great Making Of featurette that covers a lot of ground and answers a lot of questions regarding the story and what was happening with the virus. I loved hearing that the actors didn't get to see a lot of things until the filming began, in order to get real reactions to things. It reminded me of how no one got to see LeatherFace in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre until it came to the actor's death scenes. What better way to get a scared reaction?  [REC] is one of my favorite horror movies by far. I can see why people who loved 28 Days Later love this one as well, and am ashamed of myself for not seeing the sequel yet. If 'reading a movie' bothers you, then you can watch Quarantine and essentially get the same thing out of it. And if you're sick of movies that do nothing but try to show off cool ways of killing people, you will more than likely like this little beauty here.
B0009P42S2|3.0|Having previously found Katsuhiro Otomo's [[ASIN:B00012QLQ4 Akira]] and \\"Cannon Fodder\\" from [[ASIN:B00014X8KO Memories]] to be gorgeous, incomprehensible messes, I cannot claim I had high hopes his Steamboy would make a lot of sense, but I did harbor SOME hopes.  Alas, no such luck.  I'm forced to agree with the several reviewers who wrote that the story alluded to in the drawings over which the End Credits ran (called \\"The Adventure Continues\\") looked like a much better (and potentially more entertaining) story than the one Mr. Otomo insisted on telling us.<br /><br />Steamboy is certainly chock full of ideas, but they are all ideas that have been repeatedly expressed before.  Among these are many that nobody would dispute and thus hardly needs reminding of:<br /><br />War is terrible.<br />Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br />Technological advances (like EVERYTHING ELSE) can be misused.<br />The conduct of the Great European Powers in the generation prior to World War I was suicidally stupid, almost as suicidally stupid as was the conduct of Japanese militarists prior to World War II.<br /><br />In addition to these Mr. Otomo tosses out a couple other ideas more easily disputed:<br /><br />Capitalism is bad.  As compared to what?  There is a reason capitalist countries have to build walls to keep people out, communist countries have to build walls to keep people in, and socialist countries have to tear down their walls in order to deal with the fact that their socialized-into-uselessness citizens have lost, along with all other ambitions, the ambition to breed a new generation capable of funding their continued uselessness.<br /><br />Designing, manufacturing, and selling arms is wrong.  That rather obviously depends on who you are selling them to and what they will be used for.  People who see no difference between arming dictators for conquest and arming democracies for self-defense and liberation of the conquered and enslaved are probably delusional about lots of other things as well.  Of course arms manufacturers selling advanced weapons indiscriminately to the highest bidder is arguably a bad idea, but since outside of fiction (where it has become a clich&eacute;) this doesn't actually happen, it's a moot point.  Strong governments, without which advanced arm manufacturers cannot exist, will not tolerate this sort of thing; anytime something like this is alleged to have happened in real life, you will invariably find that the controlling government at least tacitly approved,...<br /><br />or somebody's going to be executed.<br /><br />Why have I ignored the plot in my review thus far?  Well, Mr. Otomo doesn't deem it very important, so I don't see why I should.  Briefly, Ray Steam's (Yeesh, what a name!) father and grandfather have a disagreement over the proper use of a great scientific advancement, the steampunk equivalent of nuclear power, and though they never truly resolve it, they do manage to trash a large part of London debating it.  In the process Ray Steam manages to save the rest of London (Yay!) and the thoroughly obnoxious Scarlett O'Hara (a considerably less obviously good result).<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />IMHO Katsuhiro Otomo's brilliant artistic vision deserved a lot better than Katsuhiro Otomo's thoroughly inept plotting.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is an excellent book written by a business man who obviously knows business and marketing. As a professional business man myself for more than 40 years, I know how much time and thought John Locke spent on developing and perfecting his marketing system (which obviously works since he's selling lots of books!).<br /><br />I was dismayed by some of the negative reviews; did these reviewers read the same book I did? The book contains some very valuable information for authors which I've seen nowhere else. I particularly like the marketing plan, which the author explains in great detail. Some reviewers complained about the author's writing, but I found it to be clear and concise which makes the book a very easy read.<br /><br />In my opinion, this ebook is worth hundreds of times more than I paid for it.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|This is a great country album! There are obvious key issues that come with being a freshman but overall very good.  Other than I Love You This Big (which is incredible)there are plenty other good songs. The title track is a 100% tear jerker. Don't listen to without tissues :) Dirty Dishes is a really sweet song. The Trouble With Girls makes my heart melt.  Overall, there were a few songs I didn't really like so I couldn't give it a 5 star but I will advise- ALWAYS listen to the song at least twice before saying you don't like it.   Totally worth the money :)

People need to know that evanescence will change their style in music. this album is excellent, BUY THIS

It is way too early in the season to trash the entire series because the story line doesn't follow your expectations.<br /><br />Besides.

1932100385|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me and it changed not only the way I eat but also my life. I decided to avoid animal foods and switch to a plant based diet mostly for health reasons. My total cholesterol level was close to 300 and it was time to do something drastic. What did I have to lose? After just four weeks on the diet, I decidied to have my cholesterol checked. I wasn't very far into the diet change at that time but I wanted to see if my hard work had paid off any. My cholesterol level had dropped from 283 down to 220. My goal is to get it below 150.  I still have a way to go but if I can do it, anyone can!

Vin Diesel wins!?!?  -Extremely long and pointless chase scene at the end where the director is just throwing away money crashing a lot of ford explorers in south america because it's cheap  -The only good part of this movie watching jordana brewster onscreen, but by the end im sick of everything on the screen.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|While the movie itself was so-so, the biggest disappointment you will experience from buying this version of the film is the digital copy that is included with it. This digital copy will not work in iTunes and requires you to register accounts with TWO different services (Flixster and Ultraviolet) and install a new application on your computer before you can download a Flash-based digital copy (that will only play in the application you had to download). Forget being able to download it to your iPad or playing it on your Apple TV. If you are accustomed to keeping your digital collection in iTunes and using that collection across devices and platforms, avoid this new Ultraviolet digital stuff!

B005I547ZG|4.0|I'd dare say that this October could be named Michael Connelly, or rather Harry Bosch month, since during it no less than three books starring the legendary cop will see the light of day. Never mind that two of them, this one and Angle of Investigation are just short story collections (both out already in England and Ireland) and can only be acquired as eBooks. (There are three short stories in each of them.) The third one, The Drop, is of course a novel, and it will come out on the 27th of October in Europe and a month later in the US.<br />  But let's now take a look at the eBook at hand. Suicide Run is the title of the first story in this collection, in which we find Bosch and his partner Jerry Edgar working the night shift at the Hollywood Division. During it they are being called at the scene of a suicide. The suicide victim is a young wannabe actress and at the beginning things look clear as day. However Harry thinks there's more to this case than that which at first meets the eye, so with the precious help of one of his favorite colleagues, Kismin Rider, he decides to take a better look at the facts surrounding it.<br />  In Cielo Azul, we meet the good detective while he's on his way to the San Quentin prison. He's going there to meet a psychotic killer, a few days before he's executed for the brutal murder of a fifteen year old girl ten years before. Bosch, who arrested the perp, only wants to meet him in order to find out what's the real name of the victim; the girl he came to call and remember as Cielo Azul.<br />  One-Dollar Jackpot is the title of the final story in which Bosch is called upon to investigate the murder of, a minor celebrity and full-time poker player, Tracey Blitzstein. The woman was shot dead while in her car outside her house. Being in the kind of business that she was, and having earned a big sum of money at the casino, not long before, it's obvious that more than one people would want to harm her. The perp could be one of her competitors, or a thief, or even that mysterious man that followed her out of the casino. But, as it's often the case, things are much simpler than they seem.<br />  In this short collection we have three well-written stories which will undoubtedly bring enough joy to the fans of the good author and his most likeable hero.hief, or even that mysterious man that followed her out of the casino.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|I've always struggled with Nick Hornby.  I found High Fidelity by accident in my mid-twenties and connect with it on so many levels.  I was frustrated throughout the years because I couldn't \\"get into\\" his other work.  Juliet, Naked is different.  It was the perfect book for me and for this stage in my life.  I understand that many people are upset with the ending but I'm not.  I loved it.  Life is never wrapped up in a pretty package and finished (until you're dead).  Would I enjoy a sequel?  Yes, but maybe that is being selfish.  Also, it might be my desire for things to be wrapped up in a pretty package.

0553801473|2.0|I, like many of the other reviewers of this book, read the first three volumes with reckless abandon, excited by the prospect of reading some fantasy with more developed characters and plots, intrigues, mayhem and less of a reliance on magic and magicians as a panacea for the mortality of main characters. At first, I was impressed, but even at the early stages I felt some annoyance at Martin's choice of language, and especially the repetitiveness with which it was employed. Say it with me folks: &#34;Break his/her fast&#34;. Like most readers, this was not enough of a reason to condemn the book or the story. Fast forward to A Feast For Crows. The plot has become completely bogged down, and new characters are coming out of the woodwork. I was so naive as to think that A feast for Crows would be the last book since it was originally supposed to be a trilogy. At the conclusion of the book, the author tells us not to worry, that there is much more to say in the next book. This gave me pause.  And this brings me to my review of A Dance with Dragons, the last but five of the Song of Ice and Fire &#34;Trilogy&#34;. Fear not true fans, there is absolutely no end in sight.<br /><br />My first and biggest complaint about this book is the chronology. I have not read all the negative reviews, but I am certain I am not the first to mention this fact. This failure, this bitter and unnecessary incumbrance, really destroys the continuity of the story and basically casts the reader adrift for the first 500 pages. It is not enough for Martin to point this out in a short preface at the beginning of the novel as a means to rectify such an avoidable mistake. If he had all this material written, as he says at the end of A Feast for Crows, but decided that it was too much for one volume, then why on earth would he split the story in this fashion? This decision by the author, or more likely his editor, basically destroyed the cohesion of an already messy plot. Now, depending on how long ago the reader read the last book, and in my case it was about nine months,  the burden is placed entirely on the reader to remember everything that was happening previously with all the different characters and then to try to assimilate the information they are reading now into the aforementioned timeline.  What kind of author foists this on his reader? In this context, there is really only 400 pages of plot progression which means that there was no chance for a resolution, and there is little chance that there will be an end to the story anytime soon.<br /><br />Like most readers of this series, I had expectations that something dramatic would happen in this book, that the final push to Westeros by Dany and her newly assembled army would happen somewhere in the middle, and that by the end she would have taken the Iron throne, defeated the pretenders and united the Seven Kingdoms bringing the series to its natural close. I am now convinced that this will probably never happen, that the author has lost his way and fell in love with his own bloated prose and his penchant for long meaningless lists (especially with foods), a never ending parade of pointlessly extravagant family relations that detract from the main plot, and an even more disturbing milking of his audience which brings up a sickening comparison to Robert Jordan.  I am no longer invested in this story. I no longer care about the characters that once so enthralled me. I no longer care if, when or how the Lannisters will get their comeuppance. I do not want to see whether the realm can be held against the Others, whether Winterfell is returned to the Starks, whether Bran becomes a Greenseer (and if that even makes some difference in the plot), or if Jaimie or Tyrion can be rehabilitated; whether or not  Dany can master her dragons; at this point I am too exhausted and too negatively inclined to believe that the author will draw the story out even more than he has so that he might sell a few extra books.<br /><br />I was disappointed to find the first 600 pages were evenly split between Dany being completely indecisive and not advancing the plot anywhere; Tryion  needlessly spinning his wheels in a lame attempt to reach Dany in Mereen, but never quite getting there and asking himself a million times &#34;where do whores go?&#34;, thus not advancing the plot; Jon vacillating between indecisiveness regarding the new role of the wildlings and going in endless circles about his feelings concerning Stannis, Winterfell and his role as the Lord Commander of the wall-- basically, not advancing the plot. All in all, there was too much &#34;nothing&#34; happening, but it was taking overly long for it to happen. No resolution for Cersei, this storyline will have to drone on with her conniving and conspiring for no apparent purpose. No resolution for Jaimie, as he has reunited with the previously dead Brienne of Tarth to find the missing but totally unmissed Sansa Stark who was last seen with the now completely irrelevant Little Finger. No resolution for the Iron Born, but it is just as well because at the slow rate that their ships sail, they will have missed everything by the time they arrive. No resolution for the Onion Knight, a character that at this point should no longer even have a role. No resolution for the Dorne, but nobody took them serious anyway since the Red Viper perished at the hands of Gregor Clegane. No way in hell that Samwell Tarly will possibly be making a meaningful addition to the plot in the near future (unless he studies at the speed of light). The same goes for my favorite character in the whole series, Arya Stark. If I was Martin, I would give up on the massive unnavigable mess he has created with A Song of Ice and Fire and write a smaller novel about the adventures of Arya as one of the faceless men.<br /><br />I could write more, but unlike George R R Martin, I know when I have said enough.

Every since I finished graduate school, I have little interest in technical reading.  This book was a perfect mix of the science that rules our life, and the story of the woman who provided us with most of science's medical break through.  It is an endearing story of a forgotten human being known as HeLa.  I still cannot forget this book, and the memory of Elisa Lacks and Henrietta, will stay in my heart and mind for a long time.

The production is basically not there, just film the concert, leave.<br /><br />It's a decent show, mostly covers and bleach songs with some Nevermind sprinkled in.<br /><br />All in all okay, decent picture (upgraded to 16:9 but avail in 3:4 as well) and sound even without the 24/96 -- though there's no noticeable difference between the pcm and dts.<br /><br />A good buy for those who like Nirvana.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of the strongest album that I have heard in many years. Every song in the album is exceptionally good and every song has the real possibility of being a #1 pop hit if not just in the top 10. The whole album is well worth the money you spent purchasing it.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|A must have accessory for shooting indoors, in car, and not taking camera out when connecting it to USB. We were able to use the setup to record in-car video with driver and passenger talking to the camera.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Lets you keep the camera in the case - no opportunity for fingerprints on lens<br />-Quick connect of cables and popping out SD card<br />-Mic is open so is much more sensitive to audio around the camera.<br />-Good fit and works as a replacement even if display back is attached.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Not water proof - Duh!<br /><br />80% of the time the GoPro sits in this case. The other 20 its in the water proof one.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Man, I wanted to like this movie. I'm a big sci-fi fan. I do not think revenge of the fallen was as bad as people say it was, I even enjoyed the first transformers, but this. Oh-my-gosh. What a piece of garbage. I rate this down there with Avatar (the movie version of the nickelodeon cartoon, also a fan, huge let down).  I am very forgiving of sci fi movies as I do not expect much in the way of plot/story line. I am a big fan of cool special effects, but this was so corny, cliche and chock full of redone and rewritten old jokes and plagarized scenes, that even I could not take this. I am becoming angry even now, while writing this.  20$ for this piece of copro-cinematic  excrement is $19.50 too much!!!!
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Can't tell what pieces are what? It's Checkers you idiots, not Chess! The pieces ARE all the same!  Good game overall. Online multiplayer would be great, or even LAN play; 2-player on same device is just too awkward.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|This movie is lengthly but it is great story telling about the crew of this U-Boat. You feel that you are one of the member as the camera moves from one section to another. The Director does a very good job to keep the story moving forward without any stand still moment. The picture on the Blue Ray format is good for a movie that old. This movie was in VHS, LD, DVD and Blue Ray, it has passed the test of time. It is the best WW2 movie about German U Boat crew.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I have seen pretty much all the Jane Eyre movies and I didn't get the thing I get in my soul when I watched this version.  She didn't move me or bring me into the movie like the 2005 version did, her name is Charlotte Gainsbourg, now she was amazing.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|Good price, I looked around and this was the best price for the DVD's. The DVD's worked great and we had a clear picture. We were really into it, so we ordered it shipped fast, what a bummer though the ending was totally lame.
B004ZN9RWK|3.0|This remaster is nothing but another money grab.Years ago I was lucky enough to buy on E-Bay \\"The Dark Side\\" transferred into DTS by somebody.There is no words to express this version of the recording.The latest remaster of \\"The Dark Side\\" sounds like mono comparing to DTS.I wish all of them were released in DTS,than you can have your best Pink Floyd to listen to.If you have already a copy of \\"The Dark Side\\",do not bother and don't buy new one.
0553266306|5.0|I read \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" when it first came out, and thought it Fantastic! The plot is so intricate, with such great details, as the assassin known as The Jackal makes his way to France to assassinate De Gaulle. The French police get wind of the assassination attempt and assign their best man to find The Jackal and stop him. It's a testament to Forsyth's writing skills that there are points in the book where a reader doesn't know who to root for: The Jackal, or the Cop.<br /><br />About twenty years after I first read this novel, I read it again, just to see if it was as good as I remembered it. I enjoyed it every bit as much the second time around. This novel could very well be the best-written thriller ever -- and it certainly set the standard to emulate. Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|needs the new updates but lots of fun when the new updates come out this game will be complete be careful this is very addicting
B004GJNFHG|2.0|This film is certainly a strong piece of cinema but for me it was ultimately unsatisfactory.  I had expected a deeper exploration into the questions around the basis for the hunger strikes but this film presents such an extreme vision that it's hard to respond beyond a simple visceral reaction.  Perhaps it's because it's a subject I'm more familiar with than most (I had relatives living in NI during this time) that I expected more.  There's not much in the way of nuance here.  The hunger strikers were clearly not political prisoners (in that they were locked up for terrorist acts not for holding or espousing controversial political views - which is normally what we mean by a political prisoner) but this isn't really explored in depth by the film.  The potentially interesting issue is that they clearly saw themselves as being politically motivated and that drove them to wish to see themselves as much more than simple terrorists.  But again very little of that is explored.  It's more like watching a street brawl.  So for me I can't recommend this.
0316066524|1.0|Based on hype, especially that of Amazon.com, I purchased this novel. This probably should be a warning to me and others, that Amazon.com hype is just that, hype. A humorous book? - no. Absurd - Yes.<br />I suppose that some might consider Wallace a great writer, but was he popular? He probably sold more books on hype than on talent. At the same time as I bought \\"jest\\" I bought \\"Consider the Lobster\\" a collection of essays. In my opinion, he strikes out on both. Footnotes like there is no tomorrow and not much of a beginning, middle and end to his stories/essays.<br />All in all, I suppose Wallace will just become a footnote.
B003UESJHO|5.0|\\"The Fighter\\" is very much in the mode of American sports movies, where the hero must overcome a tragic character flaw in order to achieve fame, glory, and victory.  In this case, the tragic character flaw is also the best part of the movie:  Christian Bale delivers an Oscar-winning performance as a crack cocaine addict who is pulling down his younger brother from boxing glory.    Christian Bale is one of the best actors, if not the best actor of his generation.  He was mesmerizing in \\"American Psycho,\\" and in \\"The Machinist\\" he demonstrates his devotion to his craft by losing enough weight to become skeletal.  But \\"The Fighter\\" is definitely Bale's best performance to date, and it's his performance which sustains and ultimately propels the movie.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Needs the ability to: change the board and piece colors, sneak pieces on/off the board when the opponent/computer isn't looking (use the front camera), and shake the phone to accidentally knock the board and tie the match.   Custom rules when you get tired of plain checkers would add to the longevity, like eating vertically or horizontally, changing board dimensions, and power-ups like lasers.
B004EPZ084|4.0|\\"Horrible Bosses\\" falls into a category of irreverent and ironic humor that is all the rage in American cinemas and television.  Three hapless guys with horrible bosses come to the realization one day that their bosses are indeed horrible, and thus starts a chain of nonsensical events that basically become the plot of this movie.  The best part of this movie is Jennifer Aniston, who in the best role of her career is an utterly sexy and convincing as a sex-crazed dentist.  This movie is witty at times, but it can also be too lazy and convenient in other places.  Nevertheless, it's still an entertaining ride.
B0052YAKS6|3.0|Half the songs are great, and the other half are average and I had already heard them on the radio.  There are some good songs on there, but it's not his best work.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|This supposedly funny movie about a bad teacher who supposedly redeems herself doesn't do anything but bore and stupefy.  How was this movie made?
B005G5PPGS|4.0|This is the most unlikely of books to be made into a movie. As it turns out, I really loved the movie, and I enjoyed the book.  The question that author Michael Lewis sets out to answer is how is it that the Oakland A's could rack up wins like the Yankees with a payroll less than half the size.  What he found is that the people who manage baseball teams are not penalized nearly so much for failure as for flouting convention.  Worse, they are burdened with quite a few erroneous notions about what makes teams win.  Although most of the book focuses on Billy Beane's tenure as GM of Oakland, the bigger story is the baseball establishment's outrage at Beane for daring to question tradition and conventional wisdom.
B004P7CN7W|4.0|This is such a great movie. We all have thought that are teachers are aliens anyways so why not have a movie that proves it.
0930289528|5.0|I don't know why I had expected a glossy paper printing. This is printed on standard 'newsprint' comic book paper with a glued binding. Which is fine.<br /><br />This is much more involved than the movie (to be expected) and more than a little dark. The artwork is well done and only adds to the story rather than detracting from it.
0307450570|5.0|Fnally, I was able to purchase this book.  It will help me to create projects that I have been wanting to begin for quite some time.  I am delighted!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|In saying Morgenstern's style reminded me of a less-intellectual Rushdie, I mean no disrespect.  Morgenstern exhibits the same evident love of descriptive prose, and surreal setting.  Unlike in any of Rushdie's works, there was no carefully contrived deeper meaning in The Night Circus. It was simply a lovely gem of a book.  I loved the slow pacing, and the vivid sensuality of Morgenstern's prose--colours, tastes, smells, textures and sounds were beautifully rendered.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|Let me just start off by saying I love collector edition box sets for my movies. I recently purchased the Lord of the Rings Trilogy box set and let me just say that box set is beautiful! They really put a lot of effort into it. It's a very sturdy box set with beautiful artwork, embossed lettering, etc. Go look for yourself to see what I mean: http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Fellowship-Extended-Editions/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1318790981&sr=8-4   So those are the types of collector editions I look for, so when they come out with a flimsy cardboard box like this one for Harry Potter, it just baffles my mind that they put so little effort into it. However, if you do not care at all about the box and are only in it for the movies themselves, then by all means get this! This is for you if you are only buying it for the movies! But if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful movie collection on your shelf, then it's not worth it if you already own all of the films.   So that's just my opinion, but in the end it is really up to you. If a flimsy cardboard box set is perfectly okay to you so long as you have all the films, go for it! Otherwise, avoid this and maybe they'll come up with something better at some point.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I,also, read the book Another Man's War.  Sam Childers didn't pull punches or try to sugar coat his previous actions. He saw the horrible atrocities that were happening and decided to help the children with God's help. I have waited as so many others have to see the movie, Machine Gun Preacher. After waiting months, much to my dismay (& anger) I am unable to see it because I would have to drive 150 miles to see it. Relativity Media who supposedly was distributing it, released it in a few movie theaters skipping some states all together!! It's a shame since Gerard Butler appeared on many, many TV, radio, press interviews to let people know about the film and Sam Childers.  Well we know about them but we can't see them so I will wait for the DVD unless Relativity Media prevents that also!! I don't know whose making the decisions in that company but they are wrong decisions.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|I am a fan so not going to repeat all the good things already said or you already know but I will comment on the girlfriend. She is annoying. I believe she is British. The accent and those lips ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FIT this All American movie. She is useless and I did learn to ignore her. No chemistry between her and anything in the movie. It just does not fit. They should have found some American girl that is tough, rough, and All American.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I bought the digital version via iTunes, and preordered the CD via Amazon. All I can say is that this work grows on you... you have to let the songs PLAY and LISTEN then let them work their magic. Sometimes Bjork gets dry on melody, and honestly I don't know if it's by feel, design or random... but that's the feeling i get a sort of random dialogue and the sounds and music accent her intended mood and expressions within her conception of the songs.   Biophilia, yes this is a very inward, organic yet cosmic collection. I hadn't heard the single Nattura and it does stand out quite separate in kinetic energy to the rest of the actual collection, which makes sense.

0446547603|5.0|Nicholas Sparks wrote an amazing story & it is definitely one of my favorites, not only by him but by anyone. =]
0439023491|5.0|This series was so great and interesting. I bought all 3 books at once afterreading some of the reviews and I was really happy I did. Once you begin reading these books, you won't be able to stop!
0446547654|3.0|I really do love Nicolas Sparks and I am always waiting for the next book to hit the market. About midway it was getting a little interesting and I knew that someone was going to get murdered by Dawson's cousins. I was a little confused by how predictable the book became, right away I was like the running shadow he keeps seeing is the only dead runner in the story. Also, right when the Dr said that Jared (Amanda's son), was going to need heart surgery, I automatically knew that the heart would come from Dawson. The next thing I have to say is that to me it was a little creepy that the heart that was once beating hard for Amanda, was now in her son-but like i said, maybe I'm the only one who thought that. Also I was left a bit confused on some things because normally Sparks throws daggers at the end of his books, meaning that he links everything together making you say OMG he is an amazing writer at least 5 times in the climax. This ending though, I was left confused, saying, \\"Wait I thought the car Dawson worked on was going to be linked, like whoever owned it was important. Who owned that car anyway?\\" or \\"When is Amanda going to confess to her husband she cheated?\\" I guess what I'm trying to say is that there was no \\"OMG\\" moments. And it also sort of sickened me that Amanda stayed married to her husband and also had the nerve to say something along the lines of, \\"Maybe my ashes will find Dawson's when I die.\\" She was sort of just some confused girl and I really didn't know what she truly wanted.<br /><br />Now that I have blabbered on about the things I didn't like;<br />I must say that it was a good read and most of it I did like, It is worth buying and reading and it did make me smile a lot.

B004XGN8W4|4.0|I had 3 options to play my Xbox at work...<br /><br />Option 1: Capture Device/Laptop Screen-<br />This was desirable to me because it removed the need to buy an additional screen and haul around extra gear.  So I looked to things like Easy Cap, Dazzle, and Hauppauge capture devices to play Xbox on my laptop screen.  Unfortunately, using a capture card and viewing the game on a laptop screen experiences lag, and in the case of the Easy Cap and Dazzle, a 480p resolution.  The clincher for me was the lag.<br /><br />Option 2: Small 15 Inch HDTV-<br />This option seemed like the next best choice.  I would need to buy a larger bag to take both the laptop, the Xbox, the HDTV and whatnot's to work.  This option is definitely viable, but after the price of the bag and television I would end up paying close to what the G155 already costs, albeit less.  Additionally, the Xbox wouldn't have felt as safe and setup and takedown of everything would have been more cumbersome.<br /><br />Option 3: The Gaems G155 Mobile System-<br />This appeared like the best of the three options for me.  In essence it was an HDTV within a container that seemed both organized and sturdy, so I ended up buying the G155.<br /><br />**************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />After purchasing and using the G155 here are a few areas of improvement for the device...<br /><br />Dead Pixels-<br />As with many new screens there are a few dead pixels, but generally I don't notice them, although it's not ideal.<br /><br />Loose Seam-<br />Sometimes the case comes loose at the middle, near the handle while I carry it.  I feel that this would be solved if there was a latch mechanism installed there, like in a briefcase.<br /><br />Carry Strap-<br />I wish I had a backpack or messenger bag that was large enough for the G155 unit to fit into.  I'd like the actual case to be hidden from view and be more protectedfrom scratches and scuffs.  Also, a backpack's or messenger bag's carrying straps would be very nice as opposed to carrying a heavy load with just the current handle.  I'm aware that Gaems has stated that you can attach your own strap to it and they might be making one of their own for the unit, however carrying the unit completely immersed in a bag would be ideal for me, although I haven't found a bag large enough for the unit to fit into.<br /><br />Price-<br />I bought the G155 off Amazon at $270.  If this unit sold for $200 or even $250 it would have been an easier purchase.  I understand that they have to consider the bottom line and profits but a $200-250 unit would be more convincing for me as a consumer.<br /><br />[Those are my only beefs with the G155 as of this writing.  Unlike some owners, mine will be used extensively in the future, so we'll see how well it holds up for me over time.  Hopefully it won't break down easily with a lot of use.]<br /><br />**************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Now on to the things I love about the G155...<br /><br />Xbox Stays Cool-<br />After hours of continuous gameplay my Xbox does not overheat at all within the G155.<br /><br />Protective-<br />My Xbox feels much safer in the hard plastic case compared to carrying it around in a normal bag.<br /><br />Compact/Organized-<br />All of my cords, controllers, and pretty much everything I need easily packs into one gaming environment. [Note: I bought a small CD sleeve to carry my game discs within the G155.]<br /><br />Mobility-<br />I can leave my Xbox in the case and hook it up to my large TV at home without removing it, then just close it and take it to work when needed.<br /><br />Screen-<br />The HD 720p screen is clear and gorgeous to look at and there is no lag whatsoever.<br /><br />**************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />In summary of my 3 mobile console gaming options...<br /><br />Option 1: Capture Device/Laptop Screen-<br />I do not recommend this as a sole way to play consoles on the go.  The lower resolution and lag times are not cool.<br /><br />Option 2: Small 15 Inch HDTV-<br />Having done something similar to this in the past, it is definitely a viable option, based on if you're looking for something less expensive and your personal tastes.<br /><br />Option 3: The Gaems G155 Mobile System-<br />This, I believe, is the best all-around option for mobile console gaming, or if you want an extra small television in your home where you can play Xbox or PlayStation.  I'm very glad I purchased it and would recommend the Gaems G155.<br /><br />Hope this helps perspective buyers.<br /><br />[Update: I've now used the Gaems G155 for six months, and on a regular basis.  It's held up great, and I've had no additional problems with it.]
0393317552|4.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel is a great read, with provocative ideas that pose a grand unifying framework (I would not describe this as a \\"theory\\" for reasons explained below) for how to think about cultures, civilizations, and development.  However, the argument is actually much more limited in scope than what the readers are liable to get out of the book--and I could not escape the feeling that Diamond was subtly encouraging in his prose the somewhat more extreme interpretation that is not necessarily warranted by his argument alone.  Make no mistake:  the core of the book is the comparison between whey civilizations that arose in Eurasia went farther than its counterparts in Africa, Austronesia, or the Americas, not necessarily what parameters guided the paths of development the civilizations that appeared within these mega units.  The larger geographic scope and greater biological diversity within the larger mega units provided greater external limits on possible growth and development for the societies that emerged therein.  So, it came to that some civilization from Eurasia would have been much more likely to conquer the Americas, rather than the other way around.  But what about the different civilizations within these mega units?  I don't think the framework offered by Diamond can be meaningfully used to compare, say, why the Spanish, rather than the Chinese or the Persians, came to conquer the Incas and the Aztecs.  In the mega-unit framework, after all, Spanish, Chinese, and Persian civilizations are equivalent--they are all Eurasian civilizations that had access to similar natural endowments and remained in constant contact with each other, either directly or indirectly, that facilitated transfers of technology amongst them.  I don't think this book can contribute much to the question of what differentiates among these civilizations (which, I'd expect, would be of much greater interest to the present day readers since, like or it not, very little of the New World civilizations survive as major forces shaping today's world.).  That should belong to the realm of social sciences--as some reviewers suggest, David Landes' book might be a useful contributor.  Yet, Diamond tries to superimpose his framework onto analyzing inter-civilizational differences within mega units, and that seems rather ineffectual.  In the original edition of the book, the chapter on China seemed rather naive and underinformed on the topic--specifically, he seems to buy too much into the notion that a homogeneous \\"China\\" exists, both historically and at present, as opposed to a diverse \\"West.\\"  The new edition (which I had not read) is supposed to contain a chapter on Japan, built on the premise of explaining the alleged uniqueness of Japan's civilization--and that'd seem even more problematic not only because of the potential inapplicability of his framework to the case as well as the disputable premise itself.  Diamond's article in the June, 1998, issue of the Discover magazine sparked a storm of controversy especially for the latter reason).    All in all, then, Diamond's work provides an excellent insight into why the modern world is dominated by Eurasian civilizations, but no more.  Eurasia is complex enough that there is much variation to be explained within--and this book really cannot explain intra-Eurasian variation.  Readers should constantly remind themselves of the limits of its applicability.
1597801585|2.0|Often literary conceit is beguiling to those who confer accolades. In the case of \\"The Windup Girl,\\" the tastemakers have mistaken poor writing for stylistic license. Paolo Baciagalupi's plot is occasionally inventive and in the hands of a mediocre editor could have been a decent or even a great novel. As it stands, the book should only appeal to those who give themselves into hype.<br /><br />\\"The Windup Girl\\" is written entirely in present tense, which I guess is meant to create a sense of cinematic excitement. When combined with the book's excruciatingly short sentences, the present tense writing assumes the stammering air of telegrams written by ESL students as yet uninitiated to the mysteries of past tense and storytelling. Some call this Hemingway. I call it poor. Hemingway knew how to maintain flow amidst his terseness. Punctuation mistakes abound on every page - even in places where correct comma usage would have made no impact upon the narrative's content. Breaking such rules is fine when such rules are honored in the breach. In the case of this book, I doubt the author or editor knew any better.<br /><br />More importantly, the moralizing element of the story gets lost in such a present tense manner. It works against what I assume is the author's objective. Three hundred and fifty pages of this is hard to ask of any reader.

B002MT3CIY|4.0|There are no DVD extras, as this is just a repackaging of the VHS video, but if you bought the VHS when it came out then it's probably worn out. Buy this so you can watch it, in it's original quality.  While the quality of the audio is not great, it's better than my VHS.  I had to turn my subwoofer level up to get it to sound better.  With that said, this is a great concert, Rachel Fury, Durga McBroom, Margaret Taylor did a great performance throughout the concert as they seemed to reflect the emotions of the songs as they sang them, especially in Great Gig in the Sky.  That's one thing I didn't like about the Pulse tour, is the girls just seemed like they were having fun just being there, and I bet they never listened to the Floyd before they got hired to do the job.<br /><br />There was a lot of editing put into this, lots of transitions, that seem to be overwhelming at times.<br /><br />So pour yourself a drink, relax, and enjoy this performance.

B00559B9N8|5.0|I am one of those who loves the movie version of the story, but often I've thought there were several pieces of the story missing in the movie.  Therefore I decided to read the book and all of those pieces fell into place.  I am a huge fan of many Juvinile Literature books and this one is very, very good.  The writing is tight and suspenseful, without being scary, and the characters are fun with minor flaws.  After completing the book, I much prefer it to the movie.    I purchased the Kindle version and there are some mistakes, missing quotation marks and indentations that are too far over, but otherwise it was a very good publication.
0375842209|5.0|I bought this book because our son had to read it for Honors English.  My wife and I both read it and I found it to be one of the best books I've ever read.  This book was added, nearly immediately, into my \\"must keep\\"  collection.    The book is written unlike any other book, in as much as death is the narrator, and the little snippets of information all throughout the book showcases a writing style that is believable, highly readable and a very interesting (as far a I know) creation by Zusak.    My wife and I are very interested in Germany during WWII anyway, and this being a novel set during that time, but telling the story of an unpersecuted little girl made it very interesting.    I look forward to reading Zusak's other books, but I don't know that they could ever match this masterpiece.     I guarantee you will laugh a little while reading it and I guarantee you'll cry.  Excellent.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|After \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" and now this book, Stephanie Perkins has become one of my favorite authors. If only she can write books fast enough, since I'm itching to read more of her wonderful creations. (Write, write, Stephanie!!)  Lola Nolan is a lovely, eccentric, unique and flawed young lady. She has an unconventional family setup and a very difficult and testy relationship with her birth mom. She has a rocker \\"bad boy\\" boyfriend whom her parents disapprove of. And she harbors some painful memories of Cricket Bell, the boy who used to live next door who broke her heart. Cricket and his family moved away and his and Lola's farewell was - to put it mildly - not a good one. Lola learns to adjust and move on - Max loves her and she loves him, even though her parents keep things complicated. But this serenity doesn't last long. After being gone for 2 years, Cricket, his beautiful but not-so-nice twin sister Calliope and their parents are back, and Lola's life is turned upside down. What is it about Cricket that makes her nervous and confused? She has a boyfriend, so why does he haunt her thoughts?  It doesn't help matters that he's grown even better looking since she last saw him and he seems as sweet, charming and genuinely \\"nice\\" as ever.  What makes it worse is that Max becomes jealous and suspicious, and that Cricket seems to be oblivious to the effect he has on her.  What I loved about this book - which is also what I loved about \\"Anna\\" - is Stephanie's knack for creating such unique, sympathetic, relate-able yet flawed characters. Max's character leaves you guessing.  Cricket isn't a Prince Charming without faults. And sometimes I did want to knock Lola in the head for making not-so-right decisions, but I empathized with her and had faith that - as she goes through her path of self-discovery - she would eventually figure it all out. The characters in this book - major and minor - are all fully realized with personalities of their own.  Lola is uniquely different from Anna, as is Cricket and Max are far removed from Toph and Etienne (although Toph and Max are both musicians). After reading both books, you don't get the sense that any of the plot points or characters are recycled, and both stories stand on their own (although there is a nice link to the first book - which I just love, love, love and hope she continues to do in future books). And a good romantic story always has to have some complications, of course, so the story kept me guessing and I (and Lola) wasn't quite sure how things would turn out.  I also loved the setting of San Francisco. After Venice and Paris (the setting of \\"Anna\\"), San Fran is one of my favorite cities and it has a unique personality that works well for this book (Lola and her family themselves are unique).  The general story also alludes to one of my favorite classic novels by Jane Austen - namely, \\"Persuasion\\" - which is a story of a young woman whose \\"old flame\\" comes back into her life, looking back at some of the decisions and misunderstandings from the past and the complications that arise from the return of this lost love. I don't know if this was an inspiration for Stephanie, but I enjoyed the similarity all the same.    This was such a charming and enjoyable read, and I was partly sad/partly happy when I finished it. Happy at the ending. Sad that I finished the book (perhaps too quickly) and that there were no more adventures of Lola, Cricket, et al to read.  I'm looking forward to the third book - I read that it would be called \\"Isla and the Happily Ever After\\" (perhaps Isla from book 1?). After such fantastic creations as Anna and Lola, I can't wait to re-visit Stephanie's \\"world\\" once again.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|Unbroken, Demi Lovato's third studio album, is far different from anything her sophomore record pointed toward. If rehab had never happened, we may have seen a barely-pop, mostly-rock album, much in the vein of John Mayer during it's quiet moments while exploding like an especially exuberant Paramore single during it's uptempo cuts. Instead, Demi's world spiraled to its lowest point, and she was taken out of the spotlight for majority of the time between albums, exiting rehab a different person around the spring of 2011. So what do we make of the first album from a new woman?  If you're hoping Skyscraper was a taste of what this album as whole would sound like, it's not. There are some beautiful moments, but you won't reach them until track five, the beautiful Lightweight. It's the sort of song that could have opened the album, but then that album would have been a beautiful artistic statement, something Demi doesn't seem ready for. Instead, the whole affair begins with thumping Timbaland beats and a Missy Elliot feature; hardly the sort of thing that a girl that has stared self-destruction in the face would be expected to record. It's a brilliant track, no doubt, being one of the best club songs recorded by an artist under legal drinking age this year. However, it is a catalyst to a slew of far inferior club songs, the nadir being the Dev-assisted Who's That Boy. It's completely unnecessary and nearly inappropriate, offensive at its worst. Why record a song like this when you have been through so much in your life, Demi? Why bother trying to get the club hits with an artist that is just beginning their career as it is? No strong argument comes to mind. You're My Only Shorty, with commercially-flailing Iyaz, marks another low point. Fortunately Demi pairs up with Jason DeRulo for the best song he's ever put his name on, and we begin to see a glimmer of hope.  The previously mentioned Lightweight begins the real album, perfectly performed and masterfully stripped, building slowly the feature a sparse array of instrumentation. It's one of the best moments on the album by a country mile, and what follows feels like the sort of record Demi should have kept herself to. Some beat-heavy up-tempo numbers such as the title track and Give Your Heart a Break feel genuine, though it's all eclipsed by the phenomenal Fix a Heart and tragic For the Love of a Daughter. The latter 2/3 of the album is a truly strong affair nonetheless, balancing well-penned dance songs with autobiographical heartache.  Bottom Line: Unbroken is a strong third album. It's just too bad that some poorly-crafted club tracks precede the truly great music.  Recommended Tracks: All Night Long, Lightweight, Fix a Heart, Give Your Heart a Break, For the Love of a Daughter  Skip: Who's That Boy, You're My Only Shorty, Skyscraper (Wizz Dumb Remix)
0783225849|5.0|First let me state that I am most certainly not a film student.  I like old movies, that is true, but I am not one of those people who go all gushy over every old black and white movie ever made.  Some of them were actually quite terrible by the standards of the day and are still terrible even now if we want to be real honest with ourselves an admit it.  I am not a person who particularly likes \\"art house movies,\\" many of which I find horribly pretentious and with further honesty on my part, I must admit go flying right over my head as I am not all that sophisticated.  The same could be said of many of the foreign films I have seen.  No, my level of sophistication as to films has a pretty low bar setting.  I either like a film or I do not like a film and my likes and dislikes boil down to a large number of variables. It all depends upon my mood at the time.  No, I am just an ordinary old man who hates T.V. but loves movies.<br /><br />Anyway, that being said....<br /><br />My wife and I watched this film in a rather creepy little theater in a small S. Missouri town before we were married.  This was shortly after it was first released.  I have to tell you that this is one of those movies that was instantly etched into my mind; as well as my wife I must say. (After seeing this film she developed a great dislike for showers and to this day prefers baths...go figure).  The impressions of this movie have stayed with me over the years and each time I watch it, it is like seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />I cannot think of a movie that was more perfectly casted.  Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, et al.  Perkins was truly creepy.  He had his part absolutely nailed.  Janet Leigh (One of my favorite actresses) played the role of an extremely sensual lady (which in my opinion she was) but at the same time displayed a sort of girl next door innocence.<br /><br />The script, again - in my opinion was very near perfect and if you combine that with the black and white film and the wonderfully suspenseful shots...well, it most certainly had a horrifying effect. I can remember almost literally setting on the edge of my seat during the entire film.<br /><br />Now I cannot classify in my own mind as a \\"horror\\" movie; a mistake I feel a lot of people make.  Yes, it shared some of the aspects of this genre but I have always thought of this film as a suspense movie.  After all, when you really think about it that is what the entire movie is built upon...suspense!<br /><br />Good acting, good cinematography, a wonderful script and of course direction by one of the best.  This is a combination that cannot loose. Yes, this was a low budget film and no, there were no special effects which have become almost necessary in this day and age to hold the public's attention and cover up some really bad acting and poor scripts, but this is a film that really did not and does not need all those whistles and bells to make it watchable.  I understand that there has been a remake of this movie.  I have not seen it so I cannot do a comparison.  For the life of me though, I cannot figure out why anyone would want to remake a film like this one.  That is sort of like setting around thinking \\"Hey, I think I will repaint the Mona Lisa...bet I can improve on it!\\"<br /><br />And that is all I have to say about that!<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks<br /><br />NOTE:  Amazon, in its wisdom, lumps reviews all movies of the same title together.  This is a pity.  My review was taken from an old VHS tape I have stashed.  It is a copy of the movie which I recorded a number of years ago off of late night T.V.  I do not own a DvD Player, have no clue at to what a Blue Ray thingy is, my T.V. was 15 years old...I say was because it sort of blew-up two nights ago...sigh, and my VHS player is not much newer than the old T.V.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Been wanting to see this movie ever since it was produced.  This is one of the finest.  It is a very realistic movie.  Loved it!!
B005F6NA56|4.0|I can't say for sure, but I'm fairly sure that Leslie Feist was sad when she made this album.<br /><br />There's always been a hint of the bittersweet in Feist's folk-jazzy-pop music, even though her last album was a sparkling, colorful affair. But her fourth solo album \\"Metals\\" is a far more bittersweet, raw affair, like listening to someone's heart breaking under a moonlit sky in the country.<br /><br />She sets off with the percussive, country-flavored \\"The Bad in Each Other,\\" an uneasy bleak song that makes you think of dark rooms and destructive passion. \\"We held the same feelings/at opposite times/A good man, a good woman/can't find the good in each other,\\" she murmurs.<br /><br />After that, she slips into a string of soft, slightly sad songs -- the murky drift of \\"Graveyard,\\" the starlit ballad \\"Caught a Long Wind,\\" the jazzy \\"How Come You Never Go There?\\", the string-soaked meditative \\"Anti-Pioneer\\" and its string-soaked crescendo, the heartrendingly lovely \\"Undiscovered First,\\" and the more hopeful, haunting finale \\"Get It Wrong, Get It Right\\" (\\"We'll go, can hope/have to hope...\\")/<br /><br />But she also explores some more.... off-kilter music. \\"A Commotion\\" eases us in with the sound of someone repeatedly clamping down on piano keys, only to be swept into a surreal rock of strange voices, bizarre noises and gleeful darkness. And \\"Cicadas and Gulls\\" is a proggy bulk that slowly rolls through your ears. It's strangely hypnotic, but it's also uncomfortably out-of-step with the other songs.<br /><br />I adored \\"The Resident,\\" and all the different pop styles that Feist was trying on for size. But honestly, it feels like \\"Metals\\" is almost the polar opposite -- while some of the musical stylings are similar to Feist's previous works, this one is far softer, sadder and more contemplative.<br /><br />She sticks mostly to the jazzy-folky-pop sound of her previous albums, but cloaks the acoustic guitars in a sheen of nimble swirling pianos, keyboard, toy piano and great silken masses of strings. And her slightly husky voice floats over the whole thing... except when she yowls, drones or soars. It sounds like it should be lulling -- and sometimes it is, such as in \\"Graveyard\\" -- but often Feist throws in something twisted or unnerving when you don't expect it.<br /><br />There's a sadness and darkness in Feist's \\"Metals,\\" but it doesn't make the album any less beautiful in execution. I don't think we'll hear any of these songs in iPod commercials, though.oice floats over the whole thing... except when she yowls, drones or soars.

0891419063|4.0|Never spent much time reading books, but this was a exception.  I usually wait until the movie comes out to watch.  Very good, enjoyed it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found this book randomly and had no idea what a big deal it was until I saw it on the NYT best sellers list. I have never read nor imagined nor seen the imagery in this book. It is like a visual orgasm! The plot needs some resurfacing but is hardly noticeble. Recommend to anyone that loves cross genre work.
B000068TPN|5.0|Saw this movie not long after it was produced. There was great leadership, and he had the perfect role.  Wanted a copy.  Now I got it.  Great movie!!
B004RKXN44|4.0|I really enjoy the world created by Nalini Singh and has been waiting for Hawke story since the first book.  To be honest, i would have prefer somebody other than Sienna but i still enjoy the story. Lara and Walker side story was just an added bonus and i so wish we've seen the last of Henry Scott.
0805091742|2.0|I read Better and was looking forward to reading Checklist Manifesto. Better had stories that kept me interested have stayed with me till today. I have had Checklist for 2 months now and I am still struggling to finish it. It is VERY redundant. There are some \\"ah ah\\" moments but overall it is very boring. I admire Gawande and hope I can be just as resourceful as he is when I become a physician but this book is one of his lesser accomplishments.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|This is a beautiful and high quality toy, my son will enjoy it dearly!!! (and me too!)  I love all the little details in it and also the painting
0807014273|5.0|This book gives great insight into what it was like to be a prisoner in a concentration camp during WWII. Frankl's descriptions are graphic, but help to understand why and how some people survived in those camps and so many people did not. The book gives us ways to look at our own lives and how to find meaning in our day and time and in the difficulties we all face. For those of us who are privileged, it helps to put our lives in perspective in terms of what we possess and how we view our own lives.
B005LJITS0|5.0|I missed the chance to see this in theaters and finally got the chance to see it, and as a person not usually interested in Superhero movies, I find myself astonishingly blown away. This movie was a lot of things that I, as a writer, find highly effective in the portrayal of storylines within cinematic productions. Aspects such as the portrayal of characters, development of the storyline and overall lessons drawn from that storyline which just about anyone can relate to instances within their own lives are played out in such a manner that truly seems to fit the mold of what DC comics laid out so many years ago.  As a die-hard Ryan Reynolds fan, I found his portrayal of Hal Jordan to be so well fine-tuned so that it was a refreshed version of the character portrayed in the comics, and above all else was the kind of character every person can relate to in one way or another. In seeing Reynolds' previous works from dramatic comedies like 'School of Life' and 'Chaos Theory' alongside action thrillers such as 'Blade Trinity' and 'Buried', he seems to have intermingled those past experiences together for a nice blend of humor and seriousness which is extremely hard for any actor to pull off. His character as a test pilot so high on life, mostly as a result of his father's tragic death, that he's almost been on the edge of death himself more times than the average person and hardly makes any notice of facing his own death, packs such a suckerpunch in the beginning of the movie. As the story unfolds, this arrogance that is so deeply instilled within his personality is revealed as being none other than the one personality trait he's nearly gotten himself killed over trying to avoid, that being fear itself. Once learning the meaning of the presence of such fear in his life, he comes to find a form of courage within himself much like the one his father possessed, which in turn changes his entire outlook on facing his enemies as the Green Lantern. One powerful aspect of Hal's character is how he manages the prospect of facing his own death, and that transition in facing death as an escape from fear to facing death for the sake of saving the lives of others.   \\"Don't risk anymore lives. Just mine.\\"  Similar to his portrayal of Paul Conroy in 'Buried', Reynolds nails this perception of death and its reasons right on the money, as it not only draws out the true capabilities of a single individual, but also conveys the value of life, whether it being your own or someone else's. I also liked how Reynolds was able to use his sharp wit and wisecracking sense of humor in a manner which seemed to do justice to the role of Hal Jordan. I also liked his chemistry with Blake Lively, and how she portrays the role of the love interest and the best friend at the same time. Despite Hal Jordan's unique qualities, his character is portrayed as being a person with whom anyone can relate to.  Also, from my experience as a writer, I fully understand the reasons for the film being written and produced in the manner which it was done. The key element of writing a story is perspectives, and the two main perspectives in this story was to create a storyline based on the comic books in a more refreshed manner and at the same time convey all that into a storyline which is not so complex that nobody understands it. Overcomplexity within a cinematic production can have disastrous consequences, and there is no other film genre more susceptible to such failure than science fiction. It's a writing style which I greatly admore, and if they get a chance to make a sequel for this movie, I'll be first in line to see it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee child really got this book right. While you can guess who did what, why and how, you still cannot stop reading it. The main character is well, a character he is a men's man. It is every cliche in the book but fan to read. I am still using some quotes from it and metaphors.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This movie is lame and that's all I can say about it. Not entertaining at all. The only good thing was Jennifer Anniston's haircut.
B005NXD6PA|5.0|I've been addicted to the songs \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans\\" for quite some time. I'm also addicted to the song \\"Kinda Out Of Luck\\" which is not even out yet. I love her voice. The lyrics are amazing. I am a fan of the early Tori Amos and Kate Bush; and it's refreshing to hear such a smooth retro style with a voice that's to die for and with lyrics that bring a smile to my face.

B004EPZ07K|4.0|Generally I don't write reviews for movies. I tend to let people critique it themselves, because everybody has their different take on certain movies. First let me say I'm a comics fan, I've always loved Superman, Green Lantern, and Flash, probably my 3 favorite characters of DC, anyways, I was reading that people did not like the movie because the story line was inaccurate, which; may be true, if can I recall Green Lantern found the lamp at a railroad crash and crafted the ring himself out of the lamp. I can't really remember but anyway, The reason why they (the writers/producers) don't give the indebt story anymore, or go the distance to really give you the background, you know kinda like they did to The Last Airbender, is because critics complained about not enough action in movies, or movies dragging before they get to see some action, blame the critics. Personally me, I love a good story line in a movie as long as it makes sense, but if you notice in movies lately, they give you a quick feed story line, then bang; jump in your face with non stop action, that's what it's about, thats what everybody wants to see. Bottem line, I liked Green Lantern. It could've gave you more, but overall, because I'm a big comics fan, and a fan of Green Lantern. I gotta give it four stars. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either, I've seen worse. (The Last Superman Movie, Dare Devil, The First Incredible Hulk)

B005OUDDK0|5.0|James Blake picked up where his self-titled album left off.  This album is patient with many repetitions and subtle surprises.  It takes a few listens to realize he is still experimenting and that this album goes even further than his last towards a new musical direction.  His singing and the production of his vocals are even better than his last.  There are no real pop tracks on this album, but it's subtle innovation keep it interesting for multiple listens.  Again, his lyrics don't really stand out- most of the time I'm not sure what he's saying, but they are adequate enough to capture a mood.  He also covers a female vocalist again and seems to excel at it-this time with joni mitchell's 'A Case of You'.
B003Y5H542|1.0|First, let's get the obvious out of the way: This movie was made to attract children. It's entirely in CGI, the modern replacement for ink and paint cartoons. Its cast consists almost entirely of talking animals. It was even made by Nickelodeon. Hide behind that PG rating all you want, people, the target market from the outset is clearly kids under 13.  And as you may have heard from a few of the moms and dads unlucky enough to have fallen for the sugar coating this bomb had heaped onto it in the previews, it is not something Spongebob would star in anytime soon. Loaded with dirty jokes, innuendos, gruesome visuals, and some words even the old 1950's cartoons that smoked and drank would be shy to say, this movie alienates the family audience fairly quickly.  But hey, the most positive review here on Amazon boasts that as a feature. \\"A lot of the references and humor are sure to go over a child's head,\\" as I recall. The fact that this is a completely ignorant move by the filmmakers aside, said \\"humor\\" can barely be called that by any mature, unbiased adult, leading me to believe that the reviewer must be missing one of those qualities. The majority of the \\"jokes\\" come from the protagonist's incompetence, and not in the Inspector Closeau \\"hilarious but ultimately positive\\" way, but the Daphne from Scooby Doo \\"thrown in to advance the plot and create conflict\\" way. Whether it's drinking the town's remaining water supply under the pretense of teaching a lesson or mistaking obvious outlaws for prospectors despite their stated intentions of robbing the bank, the jokes in this movie fall well short of being funny to most sane people. Interestingly, as I type this summary, I can imagine how these situations COULD be funny, if the characters and animation were completely different. I'll elaborate.  This movie doesn't have, as many people have put it, flawless animation. It has increasingly realistic animation. This is good if you're making a video game, but not so much for CGI movies, as such movies tend to fall into the uncanny valley and subconsciously repulse most humans (e. g. The Polar Express). In addition, the serious tone the animation sets doesn't match the lighthearted attitude the movie was obviously intending to capture. Had the theme been darker and centered exclusively on gunplay, conflict, riches, and survival, as most westerns are, the animation would have complimented it quite nicely. But seeing what is essentially a green, scaly version of RJ from Over the Hedge leading a Gritty Reboot of the rodent posse from the same movie to the bank robbers' lair, then put on a dress to fool them into lowering their guards is like seeing John McClane put on a tutu and dance to distract the terrorists. It didn't work for Hulk Hogan and it didn't work for this movie either.  So, inappropriate, unfunny, and ugly are all proper descriptors for this stinker. The last possible aspect they could botch is the story, and botch it they did. They could have been generic (let's find the gold), they could have been cheesy (let's find friendship), and they could have been outlandish (let's find the aliens). They chose inscrutable. The main conflict is the town's inexplicable drought, but many other aspects are completely unexplained. The random water dumped in the desert is never explained, the Big Bad's partnership with the hired gun is barely explained, and even though the Big Bad is ultimately disposed of in a Disney-death style, his evil plans are never fully stopped and remain unresolved. Top that all off with some plot convenient weakness by the \\"hero\\" (he is literally holding the villain at gunpoint and chooses not to kill him because he feels bad that he lied, and afterwards leaves the town to be ravaged because the villain asks him to), and you have a story so flimsy \\"The Room\\" seems worthy of an Oscar by comparison.  To recap, this movie is bad in every possible way. The story, the animation, the jokes, the target market, everything about this movie is absolutely awful. Move along, folks, there's literally nothing to see here.
B005EHNPRO|4.0|I started listening to Wilco in 1997, when the epic 'Being There' hit the stores.  I was amazed there was a band out there who spoke to me, because I didn't get the whole grunge thing.  As much as Ive tried liking Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana, while they had their moments, their music never rang true to me.  I was relieved there was still hope for music, a new young band who was creating something unique and heartfelt.  I never imagined I would still be following this band some 14 years later.  Here it is 2011, and Wilco are still playing amazing shows and putting out great records.  Not unlike Radiohead, they have pretty much called their own shots, and produced an impressive body of work on their own terms, slowly building a loyal following.  \\"The Whole Love\\" is a wonderful record in every way.  Great songwriting is at the forefront of this collection of pop/ folk gems.  The production (as always) is topnotch.  Wilco knows it's way around a studio, and they push the boundaries a little more on this record, with a bold opening statement \\"Art Of Almost\\".  The pacing and sequencing of this record is near perfect, making it one of the most listenable (from start to finish) Wilco albums.  Wilco are shooting for pop perfection with the ultra catchy \\"Dawned On Me\\" and the taut, rocking \\"I Might\\".  \\"Sunloathe\\" and \\"Capitol City\\" are almost Beatlesque, but thoroughly Wilco.  All in all, it's a very feelgood album. Even the brooding but soothing sweet acoustic tracks like the gorgeous \\"Black Moon\\" emit a very warm vibe.  I think Wilco realised, since this was the first album on their own label, it had to be special.  It sounds like a lot of love and care went into the making of this record.  The way I see it, Wilco are a band for the ages.  They are one of the few bands Ive been able to stay interested in for more than a few albums.  Let me also say, this is a superb vinyl pressing.  The platters are gorgeous & flawless, the way new vinyl should be, and the sound isincredible, with no obvious surface noise, and great warm, vibrant dynamics throughout.  The inclusion of a CD is very nice also.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Game works as stated graphics are great. I feel sorry for the one star dude so I hope he was just joking and not that ignorant.
0670022950|5.0|When reviewing a bottle of wine, the old Monty Python joke is that the wine isn't so much good for drinking as for home defense. It's tempting to make the same joke with this hefty tome but if there's one thing it does well, it's to convince me that home defense might be a lot less important than I think. In admirably exhaustive detail and with his characteristic light humor and solid prose, Pinker covers the history and the present state of violence in humans, first making the case that it has declined steadily (if jerkily) throughout our history and especially in the last century, and then covers many possible contributing factors. Despite covering so much material, it rarely ever feels like work. He remains conversational and engaging, adding in anecdotes, first-person accounts from history and plenty of light jokes to keep us engaged. And in spite of its length, the writing is tight and concise with little extra verbiage; it is simply a very complex subject and Pinker tackles the diverse factors well.<br /><br />Every one of these factors takes several chapters, with each chapter broken into many topical sections, and each one of these feels thorough and extensively footnoted. Like a good scientist, he spends much of his time looking at the best counter-arguments and, where applicable, even concedes their strengths. What emerges is a very complex but uplifting and thought-provoking discussion and gives us several ideas for how we might continue to build a safer world.<br /><br />To explore but one of many examples, Pinker addresses the subject of torture today and through history. If you're like me, you were probably a little shocked, upset or depressed by the news that torture is still practiced today, even in the West. Hadn't we grown out of that? Doesn't this show that things haven't changed? Pinker looks first at how torture was used in the past. It has been a public spectacle, a form of entertainment, a means of punishment for comparatively trivial crimes, and a means of forcing confessions. It was done openly and often. Today it is done in secret, to extract specific information (and not intentionally to coerce confessions), and requires a lot of subterfuge and denials when it is revealed. It isn't merely that the absolute and relative numbers have declined (and they have), but the rationale and the public reaction has changed immensely.<br /><br />It serves as a welcome illustration that the stories of a better, more wholesome past (whether that is 20 years ago, 50, 100 or 1000) are a myth. We are living in the safest, most peaceful time in history. Pinker gives us the data and the perspective to let us really understand that this is happening and walks us through several factors which are contributing and which we can continue to push us even further.<br /><br />An important, engaging work.ng confessions.

B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural was from the beggining a hit tv show, so its not weird at all that has reached a sixth (and now a seventh) season, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki add the extra something in a very succesful plot and also Misha Collin's appearences add more suspence in this season.I suggest you to buy all seasons because Supernatural is a must-have.
B004EPZ084|4.0|This movie falls into the genre of over-the-top R-rated drunk/stoner/slacker buddy movies like [[ASIN:B001AEF6HC Harold & Kumar]], [[ASIN:B001UV4XEW The Hangover]], and [[ASIN:B002ZG97XS Hot Tub Time Machine]]. If you enjoy this kind of humor, you'll enjoy Horrible Bosses. The premise that these three seemingly-ordinary guys are fed up enough with their bosses to hatch a plan to murder them is ridiculous, but if you'll suspend your disbelief for the film, you'll have a good time. Mild-mannered, straight-laced social climber Nick (Jason Bateman) works for a world-class corporate a-hole (Kevin Spacey), getting to work at 6am each morning only to be berated for being 2 minutes late. Meanwhile recently-engaged and convicted sex-offender Dale is constantly sexually harassed by his nymphomaniac dentist boss and Kurt endures the crazed ravings of a cocaine-addicted sleazebag (Colin Farrell) who inherited the company reins. Why don't they just quit? It's the terrible job market, don't-cha know? The movie uses the rationale of a bad economy, so they can't just quit. They'd have to kill their bosses.<br /><br />The humor is decidedly raunchy and low-brow, so don't expect the Mrs. to join you on the couch. There's a lot of explicit sexual humor in here and references to sexual acts, though oddly, the movie is completely devoid of any nudity. We see Jennifer Aniston in lingerie under a lab coat and then later pleasuring herself in a hot tub, but that's about it. Early in the movie, she sprays Dale's crotch with water and says some funny and nasty things. It's fun to see her in such a different role, saying and doing so many dirty things. This alone might be worth the price of admission for many guys.<br /><br />If it weren't for Kevin Spacey and Jason Bateman, I probably would not have enjoyed this movie as much. They really make this work. Jamie Foxx also has a smaller, but funny role. I also got a kick out of seeing cameos by Donald Sutherland and Ioan Gruffudd (in a humorous exchange as the \\"wet works man\\"). Inappropriate, lewd, and crass, this film has it all for guy's movie night, except maybe the beer and pizza.\\"wet works man\\"). Inappropriate, lewd, and crass, this film has it all for guy's movie night, except maybe the beer and pizza.
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|Maybee the worst movie I ever watched. Trailer looked great but the movie was shameful. I will never take a shot on another Cage or Kidman movie.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|This is a movie that I just can't help glowing about. It's so much fun and uplifting that it's nearly impossible not to get swept up in the excitement and charm of the film. At one point in the story, the audience actually started clapping and cheering loudly. Now if you can wow a crowd as tough to please as NYC moviegoers, that's a huge credit to your film. I left the theater with a smile, knowing that it was $13.50 and 2 hrs well spent.<br /><br />Real Steel is a classic underdog story. It's about an irresponsible absentee father and his estranged son whose lives are transformed through their love of robot boxing. No one expected him to win, and no one expected his robot to last, but like all underdog stories, they surprise you and defy the odds. It's got good looking leads, cool animatronics/CG robots, humor, a hot Russian adversary babe, and lots of exciting fight choreography (Sugar Ray Leonard provided boxing consultation). Set about 10 years in the future, the science fiction elements are woven perfectly into the setting, which is modern and familiar, like present day America. The look of the film in certain scenes is a throwback to simpler times like the 40's and 50's instead of the shiny futuristic stuff you'd see in hard science fiction films. There's a great sense of nostalgia and innocence to the visual feel of Real Steel. We get some great vistas of rural America and \\"classic\\" small town life -- the kind of imagery that you'd perhaps see in a Norman Rockwell painting.<br /><br />This is a great looking film that's entertaining and makes you feel good at the end. There's a lot of product placement for HP, Dr Pepper and Microsoft, but they are not overly obnoxious. You can catch an \\"XBOX 720\\" gag in the boxing venue. Catch it in theaters if you can. Looking forward to the Blu-ray release. Highly recommended.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|LIKE IT VERY MUCH. THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE GOOD BUT IT IS AWESOME. A BOARD GAME WHICH IS THE BEST.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|I only regret is that it is only on once a week. I think that the Vampire Diaries Series has the potential to run for many seasons to come. There is a fantastic set of characters that can travel back and forward in time to revel the secrets of the past and how they interplay with the present and the future. the historic perspectives are so interesting. Europe, Romania, Chicago .Mystic Fall, The plots and settings are endless can't get enough off it. Did I mention the love story and sexual tension between so many of the characters, not only the stars of the series Damien, Elena and Stefan. Want more could we possibly ask for than more,more,more!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend introduced me to this series and even though I'm generally not a SciFi fan I was hooked! Just the right mix of interesting characters - kind of like lost in space meets cowboys and aliens but somehow oh-so-much better! It really is a shame this show got cancelled but I'm REALLY glad they were able to bring some closure for fans with a full length movie. I bought this set to watch with my kids who were 15 and 18 at the time and they enjoyed it too.
0439023521|3.0|It's not the most amazing literature in the world -- but man, this is addictive.  Read the whole thing in about two days, barely looking up to eat or sleep.  Such an engrossing world, and there are moments that are heartwrenching. Definitely worth picking up.
0060872675|1.0|This is a sad day for me - I feel let down and ripped off by Sir Terry. This is not the \\"where is my cow\\" book Vimes reads to his son in \\"Thud!\\".  WARNING: This is not a children's book. This is not even a separate book - it does not stand alone. It is only (rather lazy) EXCEPTS from the novel \\"Thud!\\" with child friendly pictures by M. Grant; half \\"where's my cow\\" and half \\"where's my daddy?\\". To appreciate this book, you should first read a Pratchett book with Vimes in it, but preferably \\"Thud!\\".  MISREPRESENTATION ALERT: The page shown in the Amazon \\"look inside!\\" feature is not an introduction. This is what you can expect from the whole book. Also, the reviews on the back and the \\"ook!\\" book award as \\"children's winner \\" are funny and fictitious, but also grossly MISLEADING. No child could enjoy this book - the paper is too thin and light for little fingers to even touch, and most importantly...  < SPOILER ALERT > ...you never find the cow...!  This book is not for kids.  This book is not interesting.  This is a fancy brochure.  This is not my book.
B005M68S4W|5.0|Tony is outstanding as usual. It's amazing how great this man is  In every way as an artist.  We have truly been blessed with  Continued wonderful music by Tony Bennett.  This CD makes you want to see Tony record another one as soon as possible.  All the artists on this CD compliment the talent of Tony Bennett.  Great CD and a must have for anyone who appreciates good music.  Thanks Tony
B003CN4R74|5.0|Fantastic record, full of emotion, power and excellent lyrics. Evanescence have developed perfectly, walking new paths whilst sticking to their routes. \\"Lost in Paradise\\" , \\"The Other Side\\" , \\"Swimming Home\\" and \\"My Heart Is Broken\\" are all fantastic tracks, outdoing past efforts such as Bring Me To Life, Going Under and way up there with My Immortal and Lithuim. The album somehow manages to improve from their past efforts, The open door and Fallen, and is in my opinion already the album of 2011

1451629184|5.0|This book will stay with me for a very long time. Jaycee tells the horrific story of her kidnap and captivity with amazing grace and courage. The narrative alternates from present tense to her current reflections which show how she has remarkably processed what has happened to her (in such a very short time since her release!) Incredibly, she never \\"plays the victim\\" even though she very much was a victim in the worst possible sense of the word.<br /><br />I am so profoundly moved by this story and I wish Jaycee and her children a peaceful and happy life.

1594744769|5.0|What a peculiar little book! I was definitely drawn in from the very beginning. The characters were vivid and likable, and quite odd in a fun sort of way.<br /><br />I loved the photos throughout the book, though wish I had read a hard copy version rather than an eBook because some of the photos of letters were very difficult to read without being able to zoom.

B005LJITS0|4.0|All I can say is that this movie was really groovy. If you are a Green Lantern fan from the Sixties as was I you will not be disappointed. If you are only just discovering this far out dude - I envy you. GL rocks and so does this movie!
B005OYKI1I|1.0|On a serious note I wonder how many viewers caught the irony of the immaculate Christ the Redeemer statue over looking one of the world's largest and worst slums.   Anyway, the removing of cars from a train scene was entertaining even if not believable whether it was the quick plasma cutting or the 60mph speeding on a dirt trail with holes that would tear a suspension apart even at 5mph while not being torqued in a variety of directions. Yeah, right.   Also, falling into water from that height (jumping from the car makes zero difference - same velocity) into water is like falling on to concrete. They also forgot the air bubbles, debris and oil bubbling up from the car.   Also, the towing a massive several ton safe around at high speed was entertaining but about as believable as large headed green aliens.   The rest of the storyline and wooden stereotypic acting was a rehashed rerun of the genre. Very sleepy-boring.   For well acted creative storyline I recommend watching KickAss, Sucker Punch or Hanna again, instead.
B005R32L66|2.0|Every version of Skype is broken in one way or another.  This latest one adds front and rear camera support but breaks bluetooth support.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Found it entertaining.  You could tell they were having a blast making the movie. Good chemistry between the three guys and some good bits.  Shocker of all for me was Colin Farrell.  I would not have guessed that was him in a million years.  Not worth movie theater prices but for a home rental and a light laugh I'd recommend.
0066620996|3.0|Good to Great is an interesting read but the title and cover promise a lot that is not delivered. There is a lot of time spent telling us why certain companies made it and why others did not.<br /><br />There is a great deal of space dedicated to giving us ideas like get the right people on the bus and in the right seats. This concept is repeated, perhaps ad nauseum. There is also time spent telling us that good to great companies didn't just happen overnight. All this is great information.<br /><br />About 2/3 of the way into the book the previous book, Built to Last, is compared to this book and from that point it becomes more of a review of Built to Last.<br /><br />The concepts behind the book are good. The ideas and principles are sound. The book isn't loaded with a bunch of jargon or \\"Geek Speak\\". It is an interesting read and worth taking the time to read it.<br /><br />Good to Great is considered to be one of the important works in business. Whereas I agree that any business student should read it I don't agree that it is up to par with the previous work of Built to Last. However this book, Built to Last and In Search of Excellence are \\"Must Reads\\" for any serious business student.  The concepts presented are sound and bear repeating. I rate this work a three because it simply isn't as great as its title implies.
0785153322|2.0|As an \\"early adopter,\\" I'm disappointed that Marvel has chosen to re-release these 4 art books as a set because I purchased [[ASIN:0785151303 Thor: The Art of Thor the Movie]] and [[ASIN:0785155090 Captain America: The Art of Captain America - The First Avenger]] earlier this year and already owned the paperback version of [[ASIN:B005B1A2OW Iron Man: The Art of Iron Man the Movie]] (and paid collectively more for the 3 than for this set). All three of these are currently still in print and, clearly, a re-release is not necessary. However, I do need [[ASIN:0785143203 Iron Man: The Art of Iron Man 2]], which seems to have had a much more limited release than the other 3 books. Instead of this compilation, fans would be best served by paperback versions of the Iron Man 2 book, and eventually, of those on Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I've read hundreds of paranormal romance and urban fantasy novels in the last few years, and this is one of the best. I am constantly searching for the next great series -- like those of Kresley Cole, Karen Marie Moning, and J.R. Ward -- and Thea Harrison does not disappoint. The writing is smart and funny, the world-building excellent, the plot believable, the characters fresh and likable. This is one of those books that kept me up way past my bedtime because I just couldn't put it down. While I was reading, I was transported out of my life and into the book, and that's exactly what I look for in PNR/UF books. Highly recommended!
B004ZNACA6|5.0|I'm very disappointed at all of the negative reviews this box is getting. These remasters are grade-A, top notch! What were these people expecting? Some sort of Jesus?   This boxset and the remasters inside are awesome. I pre-ordered this boxset one month before it was released, and have listened to every album since on full volume countless times. Piper, Saucerful, Atom Heart, Meddle, Animals, Momentary Lapse... etc. They're all GODLY! SENSATIONAL! ASTRAL! No humming, buzzing, awkward or annoying volume jumps... The sound volume amongst all of the albums are equal. Pink Floyd's catalog has been CLEANSED with these remasters. I like to compare these remasters with the epic 2009 Beatles Remasters, packaging wise; yet of course more importantly, the insanely well-done quality.  I think that the negative reviewers don't know what they're talking about (they probably have these ripped at 128kbps for their iPods or have terrible speakers; both of which would definitely affect the sound quality). This box set must be listened to on top notch speakers, or ripped at the highest quality for all of the iPod users.  A must upgrade for Floyd fans. This box is fantastic.
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|Well, as a sci-fi junkie, I can get into just about anything, and this was no different. Once you plonk yourself in front of 6 episodes in a row, it's quite engaging and the acting is okay and it's shot and produced well. It's probably the most mature stargate in the series and that's probably why the fans deserted it. Because it wasn't MacGyver in space anymore, but it also wasn't as good at Battle Star Galactica, which it was clearly [ahem] 'influenced' by.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I disagree with the one star review. Chess, real chess, is played by two people who know what they are doing. This version simply weeds out the people who cannot handle chess.
B0036OS3I8|3.0|I love crocs and have been wearing them for five years but I have had nothing but trouble in ordering crocs online.  Everyone says to order a size up or down but if you are truly in between sizes like I am it doesn't always help because you don't know what would work for you.  These shoes are incorrectly sized, I am a 10, 10 and a half and I can't fit into the size 11 boots - another inch all around and it would fit like a glove but as it is I can't walk halfway down a block without suffering in pain.  If you are a true size 10 you might fit in the size 11's boots but I wouldn't risk it.  For those of you whose feet are smaller I would still definitely order these boots, they look like they would make it through the winter with no problem :)
B0051CSI0G|5.0|Great, fun film with real nasty bloodsuckers!  I'm sick and tired of glittery, weepy eyed girly boys.  Vampires are reanimated corpses drinking the blood of the living to maintain their \\"un\\"existance.  The story here is a bit like your average apocalypse film.  Something, presumably a virus, is unleashed causing people to become vampires.  The disease is spread through bites infecting any who survive an attack.  Two survivors head north to a place supposedly free of vamps fighting and killing the living dead as well as raiders and a pseudo religious group that believes the vamps are a test from God.  The actors do a fine job and the director/crew use every dollar in their small budget to bring us a good time vampire film.  I hope we get a follow up to this one.
B0000004V2|5.0|OK I only want to make one key point: When this album was made, Elephant Stone was never on it, neither was Fools Gold. Elephant Stone was a previous single recorded entirely separaely a year beforehand, by a different producer. Fools Gold was recorded over 6 months later in a completely different vein, and whilst Fools Gold is a track that truely shook the world, it must be considered separately. So boys and girls please BUY THE ORIGINAL 46 minute album with the original 11 tracks on it, as the band originally intended. Why ? Well all the rave reviews and plaudits are from that original format. If ever there was a record that was made as one, as a complete journey using various styles cleverly joined together and immaculately paced, this, is it.  I'll leave all the plaudits to the thousands of others online - this is a unique record that speaks for itself.  Download the original 11 track album and let it enrich the rest of your life.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The epicness of this movie has never changed! It was the first movie I saw in theaters (ever) and last night 9 of my 20 something year old friends crammed into my apartment to enjoy this amazing classic! The documentary at the end is also fantastic as well

Next time I'll check the reviews FIRST!
0553801473|1.0|I'm pretty sure I'm finished with GRRM. This book was painful to read, after the interminable wait and the disappointment of AFFC. Now there is a Martin renaissance involved with the HBO series, and the inability to escape his public profile is quite annoying.<br /><br />The thing that made the first three books so good is Martin's skill as a shameless, master thief. His plots and characters came straight out of Celtic/Anglo/Eastern myth, legend, history and folklore. The greatest single element of the series, a certain wall, was of course inspired by the most famous historical structure in Scotland, and in the beginning, this was clever. A certain English war among multiple families for the reign of England was easily recognizable as well, and the way he tweaked this history to fit his fantasy narrative was interesting.<br /><br />But it seems after the initial appropriation of existing source material, his well has run dry. I just don't think he himself knows what he's doing and where he's going anymore. Maybe he has to re-read his Joseph Campbell or his Latin and Greek master historians for more to pilfer, but whether that will make for a satisfying denouement and ending, (he's suppose to tie up all the loose ends he so needlessly unraveled in two or three more books?), is truly doubtful.

0385344325|2.0|In my opinion, this book was written without the talent usually exhibited by Mr. Child.  It is boring, the plot is complex in a stupid way, and I'm sorry that I paid the Kindle price for it.  I wish I could get a refund.
B004SBQAL0|5.0|I had seen the movie before and purchasing the blu-ray to watch on my hd television made it even better.  The movie is action packed which I enjoy and leaves plenty of room for a part II.  It would have been cool if the main character was a little stronger but he stepped up when he truly needed to.
B004LWZW42|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed X-Men First Class.  This was a funny and serious well-formed movie and the best of the series in our opinion.  The actors were charismatic and not lacking in dimension.  We received our dvd in a very timely manner and have watched it several times already.
0385534639|1.0|This is my first book review on Amazon as I felt compelled to after the horrible book I just read, also known as The Night Circus. I admit, I fell to the hype surrounding the book, and thought it had potential after downloading an excerpt. I could not have been more wrong.  The book is excruciatingly painful to read. As other reviewers have noted, the characters are not likable (save for Widget and Poppet), I felt no interest in the main characters Celia and Marco, there were too many superfluous details, and the plot of having a \\"fierce competition\\" between magicians does not make sense as there is no competition that takes place. Unless you call dueling where carousels and ice gardens and mazes are created.  First of all, the nature of the game and why it is even occurring in the first place is not clearly stated. I was confused from the start as to why A.H. and Prospero were creating a competition. Boredom? Nothing else to do? Ego boost? Then, when the circus actually begins, I was not aware that Celia and Marco were \\"competing\\" by creating various tents. Even when Celia and Marco question their respective mentors about the competition itself (as they do not understand it itself either), they are answered by vague responses or no responses leaving the reader wondering what the point of it all is. I was waiting for something, ANYTHING, resembling a duel, but I was left feeling greatly unsatisfied.   Second, the characters - and there are plenty - are so underdeveloped that I could not find sympathy nor support for any of them, especially for Celia and Marco. I found their romance almost forced, almost out of convenience, and their love resulting from the simple fact that they are aroused whenever they are near or touch each other. The competition ends when one dies, and I found myself hoping that death would take them both.   Third, there were too many unnecessary details. True, the author's diction was very descriptive and there is certainly not a dearth of imagery. However, I found the descriptions to be excessive and adding little to the already tenuous plot. On the other hand, if readers enjoy overt descriptions about clothing, teacups, dinners, and clocks, then this is the perfect book for you.  I am frustrated that I wasted my time on what I expected to be a wonderful story. Next time,  I will not be so quick to succumb to a book so highly publicized.

0553801473|2.0|The novels in this series have always been rather slow.  I still remember plodding through The Game of Thrones wondering if it would ever get going.  Luckily, after I got through the first 100 or so pages, it did get moving and soon I was completely engrossed.  That same formula seemed to work for the other novels as well.  Some setup but eventually the story moved well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not this book.  It was all setup and it had no climax!  Nothing. Sure he through in a few quick surprises at the end to try to justify the reader's time but after waiting 5 years and reading 959 pages all I can say is \\"that's it?\\".  I thought at least we would have had a big battle for Winterfell at the end.  Nope.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin has clearly become addicted to character POV's so much so that I dont think any of the main characters had more than maybe 150 pages focused on them.  Given that each had their own subplot none of them was able to get any sort of momentum for their stories.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed aspects of the book.  I like quite a few of the characters and even Dany, who I loathed early on, has become more interesting for me.  But I have to say, another book like this and I won't be reading any more in this series until it is officially over.
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|I have read one other autobiographical book about eating disorders (Wasted) and I found both of them to be fascinating. Portia was able to capture the mental and physical disorder that she lived through with great honesty. Although I have no direct experience with eating disorders, she was able to draw me into her story so that I was still able to say \\"this is insane\\" while still understanding what she was thinking and experiencing within the disorder. She created a world where food and body image were so consuming that it made sense to me that she couldn't find her own way out until she hit bottom.   For those hoping to know something about her relationship with Ellen - you will be mostly disappointed. This all happened prior to meeting Ellen. But the epilogue did paint a lovely picture of what love and acceptance look like in their relationship.   Once I started, I literally couldn't put the book down. I can't imagine how difficult it was to write this book. She did so in a completely engaging way. You could tell she was an A student in school because this wasn't a celebrity book. If she writes again, I will read it.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|Loved the series but the DVD set came and 3 of the dvd holders were broken and I had some trouble with 2 dvds. Part way through they seemed to skip and/or pause. I have not had this issue with any other dvd's so it is not the player.
B004RCUJ9E|1.0|I  downloaded  and decided to try the 10th difficulty first being the good player that I am. We got down to 5 pieces each on the board then I made a move that would make the CPU Jump forward one of my pieces and land right in the back of my king and my king would jump 3 of its pieces including its king but the CPU refused to jump my piece when I played infront of it. It made a different move ignoring the jump. That totally against the rules of checkers. It is mandatory that you jump your opponent piece if he place it infront of you and there is a diagonal space to jump.  I have the game save just incase the developer needs proof.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|I got this cd last week, and absolutely love it. The melodies are rich and intimate. The violins add so much depth to the songs.  I especially love In My Dreams and I Won't Let You Go.  James Morrison doesn't disappoint on this album.  Highly recommend it!

B004L07KWQ|5.0|awesome app! great to have on large screen phones and tablets! I am 26 and love this app, so give it a try!
B005F82X48|5.0|Saw them live last weekend with RED, and I liked them so much had to get their album. High energy, good lyrics, and original. Hard to find good Christan rock music, now-a-days Stop wasting your time and buy this album!
1932907009|5.0|This is really good information. Author gets straight to the point. I have to have the printed version of it because as I read I have in mind the script I am presently doing. I jot all sorts of notes on the side and underline what is relevant to my story.<br />I just cannot do all that with an e-book.
0385528752|5.0|While I didn't read \\"Made to Stick\\", I saw this book at the store a couple of weeks ago prior to a trip to London.  Decided to give it a read.  I really like the Heath brothers identification of what really makes change hard, and that there is much that leaders and would-be leaders can do to make change less hard.  It is about intention, and about motivating and shepherding, versus directing and dictating.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who may be trying to make changes in their organization, or even in their personal lives, since as we all know, sometimes the hardest organization to change is Me Corp.
0307888681|1.0|Stopped reading WWZ about a quarter of the way into it.  It's probably just me but I have to follow characters.  The interviewing of random people didn't work for me. Also being a former journalist I hated interviewing people, so my review is probably biased in that sense. I'm sure most readers judging by all the 4-5 star reviews can get over that, I couldn't. I'll see the movie when it comes out.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is fine on my stock TBolt. I just wish I was smarter so I could do more with it!
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Aa I said in the title this is a must have for any fan of TOS. Even if you only wear it as a tie tack once a year it's well worth the price. Only problem I have with it is that it seems on the small side. But that may just be perception as I am quite large.
0385534639|5.0|A delicious, sugar-spun tale with timeless elements which ring so true that it has the feel of a classic. It made a reveur of me, and I will wear my red scarf with pride. Although its magical qualities reminded me of Like Water For Chocolate and The House of Spirits, it deserves an enchanted circus tent all to itself. For beauty alone, this is my top pick of 2011.
0515149489|4.0|As is the usual case, this is a fast and fun read in which Nora Roberts places her characters in a new setting; one that is fascinating for the reader and gives us yet another refreshing change from what is the norm for most of us.  The pace is fast but slows down enough for the reader to enjoy the sensual joys of the outdoors, of beautiful craftsmanship and genuine friendship.  Ms. Roberts must be a good observer and listener as she gets and describes the emotions of her characters very accurately. Anyone who has ever been threatened by violence will find this book resonates with their feelings and need to redraw many aspects of their lives.  I found the characters well developed, consistent and believable.  In fact, so believable that I'm a bit concerned that readers will take away information on care and training of dogs from this book which concerns me as I was a former dog breeder and trainer. In this case, I would wish that there had been a bit more varied research done on the care, feeding and training of dogs as the main character is convincingly \\"knowledgeable\\" as an \\"expert\\" on these topics. I have not done search and rescue work; perhaps Ms. Roberts focused most of her research on that area and not on the basics of canine care, feeding and training. The search and rescue field seems well described, but I would need a reference book to know how well.  I doubt that many of us would turn to Ms. Roberts' books which involve a plant nursery to plan our garden, yet there is so much \\"expert\\" detail in \\"Search\\" regarding dogs that I find myself a little troubled that it will be takeaway advice for dog owners.   It would be very easy to take the romance of search and rescue and all of the details in this book as a package; I would hope that the reader will remember that this is fiction and while some research was done, the author's aim was to write a good story-not to tell you how to care for and train dogs. Yet at least one reviewer found \\"tips\\" on how to train and care for her dog in this book and this concerns me. This book is highly detailed regarding canine care, feeding and training. So, while I would not normally go far afield \\"off topic\\" in a book review, I find it important to note a few places in which a reader could get into trouble making fact from fiction.  If the reader does keep in mind that this is fiction, and, as such, not a manual for the keeping and training of dogs, then it is simply another extremely well written and wonderfully enjoyable book. I admit that I didn't put it down for long and finished it way too fast.  I liked that the ending was not completely predictable and that the author did not feel compelled to add so much horror that it detracted from the book.  I don't know about others, but these days I am not looking to be maximally horrified.  For those who are interested in taking away and furthering an interest in dogs, however, there are many ways of training them and no one fits all dogs.  As well, when her lead character, a dog trainer says \\"people food isn't good for his diet\\", I have to disagree.  What isn't good for dogs is a high fat or high sugar diet, chocolate (toxic, especially bittersweet baking chocolate which can kill a small dog fast), onions and garlic (depending on quantity-dogs love the spices and a smidge usually does not hurt them) and chewing rawhide which can get wrapped around their intestines, but I don't want to write too much about that here as invariable in making a list one leaves out something important. Suffice it to say that there are great reference books out there on these topics. This is not one of them.  The best advice about feeding dogs (whether you cook for them or give them dog food) is to learn about what ingredients are good and bad for dogs, much as you would for feeding your own child.  And, it is silly to think that the public can learn to feed a human child but not a dog.  The raw diets ARE dangerous; just as buying old dog food which has sat on ashelf after having fat (for taste) sprayed on it generating a high bacterial load. Dogs can manage more bacterial than can humans, but an overload can and will lead to serious problems whether or not it is from home cooked food or dog food.  I used to cook for my dogs and they never looked better.  I used, as one primer, this text:  Home-Prepared Dog & Cat Diets: the Healthful Alternative (Paperback)   by Donald R. Strombeck    These days there are other good books, but the second edition of Strombeck's book (written by another person) may have a critical mistake.  Or so say those who have read it; I have not yet.  I also spent time reading many other books and developed a cooked diet which could be made ahead of time, frozen in portion sizes and defrosted at will. There is a raging debate in the dog world about raw vs cooked food and I won't divert more from this book to go into it, but suffice it to say that one can learn to cook for dogs.  If not, second best is buying natural FRESH (like Flint River or one of the foods from the \\"Whole dog Journal's\\" list of \\"best in bags\\") from a distributor who gets it from the factory and refrigerating it.  Just like the feeding of dogs, the training part disturbs me.  Using a head collar is fine for many purposes; but it is not the only or best way to train. Each dog requires different methods and there are almost none that are \\"wrong\\" given a particular issue. For the average dog owner, \\"clicker training\\" is one of the fastest and best ways to train a dog.  It also has the advantage that the dog thinks that it is training you to feed on command. ;-  However, in any system of dog training \\"cues\\" like \\"sit\\", \\"stay\\" and others are not given until the behavior is set.  Otherwise, an obedient dog will learn to sit in the position it first understood the cue. (In the case of one of my early dogs, that meant always sitting with one paw raised).    For advice on training your dog, go to : [...] and/or read one of Brian Kilcommons'books. He is one of the better behaviorists of our era, believing that each dog requires different methods. As well, anyone interested in the positive only reinforcement school (with which I trained my therapy dog) you should consider trying clicker training: [...]    Whatever you chose, find a good trainer. If you go to a dog show and watch your breed show, you can ask about trainers in your area; most trainers who work with show dogs also have obedience, puppy kindergarten and Canine Good Citizen classes; and the main character in \\"Search\\" is right about dogs and owners (and others!) being much happier when a pet is well trained.    My therapy dog knew more than 100 commands before she died. Although she was not as pretty as were our champions, she was beloved of everyone who entered our house including those who were initially afraid of dogs.  As well, and most troubling is that many of the dogs in this book run free without leashes.  If you consider that the most highly trained obedience dog will respond to your commands about eighty percent of the time, this leaves a good margin for error if the dog is attracted to something interesting....across the street. I have known obedience champions whose trainer got lulled into believing that her dogs would never refuse a command and at least one got killed in traffic.  Dogs need leashing or, better, good fencing.  The kind of fencing that keeps other animals out as well as your dog safely inside. (This leaves out the \\"electric fence\\" which does not impress me for several reasons).    Sadly, the dog I gave to a family member some years ago was hit by a car due to the fact that the owner was convinced that a dog should be \\"free\\" to wander. Many breeders will not sell a pet to an owner who refuses to fence or, at minimum, promise to keep the pet on lead when outside.  This is just common sense.  No dog has more intelligence than a three or four year old child (though many of us are inclined to consider that they might <vbg>) and none of us would let our toddlers play in traffic.    My advice is to enjoy this book for what it is about; the love of dogs and people and take any real questions about care and feeding to a good trainer. Notice that I did not say to your vet: even your vet will agree that nutrition is a very slim part of their education, though it is getting better.  Some of the worst dog foods I've seen are sold by vets to sick dogs).  Now I will get down off of my soapbox and congratulate Ms. Roberts on writing about a fascinating area of the dog world and one in which so many people do so much good.  The love story is also a winner. (In this case, I am talking about both the love story between the human characters and also between the characters and their dogs).  I'm giving this four stars only because with a bit more research, Ms. Roberts might have learned some of the larger debates about food and training in the dog world and might have explained how her character arrived at her methods which are very outdated and do not reflect current behavioral, nutritional or training methods. Normally, I would not be concerned with that, but her character is so believable and there are so many specifics that the reader may forget that this is fiction.
B005VMVUAQ|1.0|Not very good, extremnly predictable.  This type of movie has been done to death.  Let's steal from the rich people story.  i wish i could get my money back.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|The role of George S. Patton in Patton, like the roles of Lt. Col. Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman and Willie Stark in All the King's Men, is the kind of role to leave aspiring over-actors chomping at the bit.  And George C. Scott chews up every scene in which he appears.  But such is as it should be.  Patton was an outsized figure in American history.<br /><br />Patton follows the career of American general and tank commander Patton from taking a command during the North African campaign of WWII through the conclusion of the war in Europe.  This gives the movie an appropriate dramatic arc as it follows the Patton's career from an untested general to being sidelined for intemperate remarks (the Germans, unable to comprehend a free press and civilian control of the military, are suitably confused) to his triumphant return to the war on the mainland to a bittersweet d&eacute;nouement.  In between, Patton's brutally honest and unfiltered mouth and intermittent tank battles keep the level of entertainment high.<br /><br />Patton is completely Patton-centric (the first hint was the title).  When Patton is off-screen, characters have little to talk about but Patton.  A German intelligence officer serves as a sort of Greek chorus, telling the audience what to think in impotent attempts to inform his superiors.  I could have figured it out for myself.  The input of other commentators, historical figures such as American general Bradley and English general Montgomery, is better taken, as the viewer is forced to filter it through the speaker's own biases.<br /><br />Patton is certainly sympathetic to the general, but it also presents him as a tragic figure.  He can never live up to his own expectations.  He is openly rueful he is not living in a different time (as if the era of WWII wasn't warlike enough for anyone).  His mouth continues to get him in trouble despite his best efforts, a particularly harsh way to fail for someone with his personality.  And in the end he is left a warrior without a war to fight.<br /><br />Little, outside of Patton speaking fluent French, is seen of Patton's intellectual side.<br /><br />The DVD extras include theatrical trailers for Patton, Tora! Tora! Tora!, and The Longest Day; cast credits; and, in lieu of a traditional audio commentary, an audio essay on the historical (I suppose to say \\"real\\" would have made them feel silly) Patton overlaid on the movie.  The audio essay is pretty divorced from the movie itself, but I found it informative and fascinating nonetheless.<br /><br />Note: this review is for the regular edition, not the two-disc collector's edition.rrior without a war to fight.<br /><br />Little, outside of Patton speaking fluent French, is seen of Patton's intellectual side.<br /><br />The DVD extras include theatrical trailers for Patton, Tora!

B004MNO0BQ|2.0|Sadly, the only interesting thing about this whole game is the neon color scheme.  The controls are very laggy (on both a Droid 1 and Bionic) and that makes the experience a bit frustrating.
B004YF6MHW|3.0|this app replaced the default camera for my g2x. has many good features however there are two things that need to be fixed. one is they need to add an option for manual exposure control... even the default camera app has that. secondly they need to fix the load up time. it takes a good 5 seconds with a dual 1.3 ghz processor phone to open up this app
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I was already a bit of a shutter bug with my phone but this app really makes me want to take pictures all over the place.  I love seeing the different effects and some are quite stunning and cool.  One tip, it works on pre-existing pictures too so if you want a 'normal' picture, just take one normally and then later go back into the app to create a new stylized copy.
B003L77G06|5.0|This really is the best comedy since Friends!And it gives a current view of our families today with some funny twists that make you laugh so hard you will cry.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|We waited a long time, but the wait was well worth it. Great picture quality and terrific sound make the Star Wars saga a must-own. Lucas takes us on a trip across the universe that excites the senses. If the dialog gets a little hokey, marvel at the background images. See a whole new world while watching Star Wars on Blu-Ray. You'll be glad you did!!
0802473156|5.0|This book is short and simple but will have a profound impact on your relationship.  We add this to all of the wedding presents we buy and feel it is the best gift we can give.
B000066C6Z|5.0|One of the unspoken GEMS in \\"Airplane!\\" style films, this one is a sendup of WW2 action/spy pieces.  The references are not as period as, say, the mentions of President Reagan in Airplane, so it ages nicer as a film, the jokes are understandable more for the next generation.  References to \\"Blue Lagoon\\" will probably pass, but are not needed to laugh at the jokes themselves.  Speaking of which, this one is more for young adults on up.  There's several sexual references, although funny, will definitely have parents scrambling to explain to their kids what's going on, or more likely, have them covering their eyes to spare explanation.  No nudity like Airplane!, but just be aware going into the film.  It's my personal favorite out of the spoof line, and yes, there's puns and some gross humor, but a more polished than the \\"Hot Shots\\" line of films (which I like, but there's more groans in that line up).  Watch for the classic, \\"Let me know of any change in his condition,\\" line!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Starting out with the concern over English subtitles, I would not worry. The movie is intriguing enough to override the concerns. I would recommend watching the movie with them. I found the English dubbing a bit weak. But the theme of the movie was excellent. I had to try it following comparisons with the Twilight series. They were right this movie is better.
0307269752|4.0|Decided to read this after seeing the movie trailer, starts slow but eventually picks up interesting characters good mystery! I will read the rest of the trilogy!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've really enjoyed this addictive casual game. I looks great, plays great, and took me a more than a week of occasional play to beat. It's worth the $1.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My favorite game on my phone. It has a perfect mix of quick play, puzzle, and action. Now I am adding more words to satisfy amazon's minimum words requirement. The fame is good though.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love this series. An age old love triangle, with a twist of supernatural. The series is going in different directions but always keeps you watching to see what comes next.
B003L77G38|5.0|Fox Broadcasting Co. presents \\"FRINGE: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON\\" [Blu-ray] (2010) - (1012 min/Color) -- Starring: Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, Lance Reddick, Blair Brown, Jasika Nicole, John Noble<br /><br />Created by J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci<br /><br />Have Fringe seasons one and two on DVD, but this is the first season I purchased on Blu-ray. And it's outstanding!<br /><br />Seasons are getting better (if you can believe that), because it was great from the first get-go.  Love the supernatural incidents, and our cast as the special task force are the one and only people who can deal with it. Also the high tech, supernatural and experimenting is a draw for the sci-fi and mystery fans.<br /><br />Each episode brings you closer to what the mystery of alternate worlds is about, but don't think you've found the answer - you haven't.  That's what keeps you coming back, week after week.  The cast grows every week, with one or the other taking the lead, and our alternate beings from the other side, are like us but not quite, there is that slight difference, that's the beauty of it - tense and downright chilling at times.<br /><br />Our lead characters handle their alternates in a meticulous way with strong acting in every step of the way.  Watching the special features on the Discs gives you the challenges the cast, special effects and stunt people deal with in each episode every week- great stuff, they keep pushing the envelope.<br /><br />As one reviewer has requested and encouraged as many folks to start viewing 'Fringe' live on Fridays.

B000007T1M|5.0|This debut from SYSTEM OF A DOWN, in my opinion is BY FAR THE BEST SOAD album, and a true masterpiece from the METAL WORLD!!!! SYSTEM is one of the most UNIQUE and POWERFUL bands that emerge from the late 90´s, opening shows for SLAYER... All the songs in this debut are full of irony, anger, HEAVY RIFFS, roars and UNBELIAVABLE drums...yes, i think SYSTEM´s debut is better than their classic TOXICITY...They never really recriated the brilliance and fury of this one on future records.....this is ABSURD CRAZY ORIGINAL HEAVY METAL!!!!! REALLY GREAT!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!! WELL DONE, SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!!!!ONE OF THE BEST DEBUTS EVER!!!!!!!!!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I love playing this game. Gives new abilities and new foes. Just got it five days ago and its so much fun! Incredible Froyo
B000021YQV|5.0|While i think SYSTEM´s debut is their best and a TRUE MASTERPIECE, TOXICITY is the REAL CLASSIC album from this great unique band!!!!! Their debut and TOXICITY are 2 REAL MASTERPIECES from the metal scene from the late 90´s and early 2000´s...TOXICITY got only powerful songs, full of irony and anger...Really, ALL the songs rocks!!!! if you like HEAVY METAL i TOTALLY RECOMMEND SYSTEM´s debut and TOXICITY!!!!!! THIS IS CLASSIC STUFF!!!!! WELL DONE!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|The book is funny, entertaining and has some very cunning insight on feminism. She gets the job done! The book is smart and fast just like her wit. The books is funny but never running to the obvious stand up comedy jokes.
0393330435|4.0|iProducts came way after Woz, so I don't understand the title, but the book is a good read.  I really enjoyed the straightforward manner he told his story.  And shame on Steve Jobs for lying to his partner.  The Woz would never do that!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I must say, I am and forever will be, a Nicholas Sparks fan. This book did leave you with questions that Sparks usually is very careful to tie up. It is a little predictable, too. But all in all, it was still a good read, and I ended up crying at the end...even though I knew that the heart was going to belong to Dawson.
1451629184|5.0|This book was a great, albeit harrowing read and I recommend it highly. What Jaycee survived was difficult to read but her inspiration shines through and through all the way. She is an amazingly positive person who lives for the moment and her story has given me an insight into how to deal with adversity.   For anyone who wants to know Jaycee Dugards story, buy this book - reading it at times made me feel so helpless yet her story of survival is one of individual bravery and courage ... I recommend this book highly to anyone looking for a story of inspiration and love.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in WINTER'S BONE, a drama about her fight to protect her family while clearing the name of her father (among meth cookers). Stark and chilling, WB takes us deep into a rural labyrinth of drugs, murder, and twisted loyalties. Filled w/ tension, terror, and sorrow, this film is strong throughout, w/ a supporting cast of realistic folks and unpredictable characters. Highly recommended...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Harmy's Despecialized Edition have rescued these films for me. Look them up. I promise you will not be disappointed.  Cheers.
B00338QENI|5.0|I was so touched by this book, the story, the fact that Henrietta should be a house-hold name ... yet wasn't.  This story is engaging and the author does a thorough job of connecting all the dots.  I was a bit hesitant at first to read this, thinking that it might be dull or one of those that you can put down half way through and never return but it was in fact the opposite.  I agree with another reviewer that this should be required reading for all students of science.  What this woman has contributed to the world of science needs to be recognized.
030788743X|5.0|I downloaded this book on a friend's recommendation and read the book in a week. Best fiction book I have read in a year! After the first chapter you will be hooked!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved this book. I finished it in two days. no lie. I read it in school, even while eating! I lovee the new characters, especially Reyna. Great book!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I used to read Thor comics when I was a kid in the 60's and 70's and so I came into this with certain expectations for what this movie should be.  Thor at its heart is part soap opera and part epic end of the world drama with alot of sensational action thrown in.  Well, Branaugh and company got it.  This movie contains all the complicated and still affectionate interplay of the characters, the warriors three, Sif, Odin, Loki, etc. and the stakes are high in the impending destruction of the frost giants.  They also got the complicated relationship between Odin and Thor right and the even more complicated relationship between Thor and Loki was picture perfect.  Probably most importantly, the Thor of the comics was a tortured soul, always searching for the right thing to do, and making plenty of mistakes in the process.  Same here.  The Thor I remember was a rash and reckless warrior, but a gentle soul in his romantic moments and is a deeply thoughtful character overall.  Again, the movie gets all that.  The action sequences were better than I imagined incorporating all of the signature moves from the comics, i.e. lightning, twirling the hammer to make a vortex, flying, etc.  I don't think they missed a trick.  The cast is perfect for their roles.  I initially had some questions about Captain Kirk's father playing Thor but Chris Hemsworth does a great job.  And only Anthony Hopkins could play Odin.  And like the comics there is plenty of humor thrown in, some tongue in cheek and some playful banter in just the right amounts.  So, whether you're a Thor fan or coming at this for the first time, take a couple hours to relish the towering elegance of Asgard and the power and heart of the mighty Thor.  you won't be dissapointed.
0439023491|5.0|All I can say is, thank GOD I didn't hear about these books until all three of them were already released, because there is no way in h*ll I would have been able to wait for a year or whatever it was between the release of each of the books.  I am a really slow reader, but I devoured all three of these books like a crack fiend in a week or two (which is really fast for me because I'm usually ridiculously busy with work too).<br /><br />Catching Fire was a bit slow for the first half, but once it picked up, it didn't let up until the end (and the end left me scrambling to grab the third book as fast as humanly possible).  I would say that out of the three books, this was the one that gave me the most moments where I found myself actually shouting, \\"YESS!!\\"  or, \\"OHH NO SHE DIDN'T!!\\" (in a good way).  :  I won't say why, to avoid spoilers.  I also thought that this book had a great cliffhanger at the end.  I would say definitely the most exciting ending out of all three books.<br /><br />Anyway, I know these are technically YA books, but I am in my 30's and am not embarrassed to say that I loved them!!  Can't WAIT for the movie(s)!!  They'd better not screw them up!!  :)
B000V5SIFS|5.0|Easily one of the best episodes of the entire series.  You don't be able to predict the climax, but when it hits you, you can't help to be emotionally moved that may even cause you to reflect on human nature as a whole.  This wouldn't have been possible, though without the excellent acting by guest star Harris Yulin as the Cardasian.  I have played the climactic scene multiple times and have remained speechless...well other than this review :-p  As much as I would agree that this episode would be a good introduction to DS9, yet I think it's more impactful when you know the background of the Bajoran-Cardassian conflict (which mirrors Germany, the Holocaust, and the Jews).  This would make the episode that more real as the viewer is more immersed in DS9's universe.  Furthermore, you'd better recognize how much of a character development this episode was for Kira.
0062011847|5.0|Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch and his wife Sybil take Young Sam and go on vacation to Sybil's ancestral lands in the country. Fortunately for the Commander, crime soon rears its ugly head and he soon finds himself ensnared in a web of lies, smuggling, and murder! Can Vimes get to the bottom of things before he finds himself at the bottom of the river known as Old Treachery?<br /><br />I always forget how good Terry Pratchett is during the year or years between new books. To the outsider, it would be easy to dismiss the Discworld books as silly fantasy novels. While they are silly, the Discworld books always deal with real issues as well. In this case, slavery and drugs. Snuff raises questions of what it means to be sentient, human rights, and the evils of looking the other way when something bad happens.<br /><br />Pratchett's writing reminds me of P.G. Wodehouse's more with each passing book. I lost count of the clever lines. I even noticed reference to Tombstone (\\"I don't think I'm going to let you arrest me today.\\"), Deadwood, and Jane Austen.<br /><br />The characters are what drive the Discworld stories. Good thing, because they could easily degenerate into mindless silliness otherwise. Sam Vimes and his relationships with his family and the people of Ramkim were what made the story. Vimes' pep-talks with Feenie about what it means to be a copper, his caring tolerance for his son's fascination with poo, and his feelings toward the goblins showed why Pratchett is more than just a fantasy writer.<br /><br />The plot itself was pretty good. A goblin is murdered while Sam Vimes is on vacation and he starts pulling at threads to find out why, leading him to discover smuggling and corruption. The disgusting religion of the goblins is explored and, by the end, society is changed. Goblins haven't been touched upon very much in the Discworld series so far and I'd say Pratchett did a great job developing them in Snuff.<br /><br />I can't pretend this book was perfect, though. The last fifty pages dragged a bit. That's about the only gripe I have, actually. It's the best Discworld book in years and if Pratchett doesn't manage to write another City Watch book, it'll be a good way to end things.ragged a bit. That's about the only gripe I have, actually.

B003L77G8I|5.0|- Dr. Brennan reciting the scientist's credo with Professor Bunsen Jude the Science Dude: \\"We get the facts and say what's true, because that is what scientists do.\\"<br /><br />BONES supports the contention that a guy and a girl, especially if they're both hotties, cannot be friends without eventually becoming more than friends. And, yes, this applies even to someone as detached and clinical as the world's foremost forensic anthropologist, Dr. Temperance Brennan. It's BONES' sixth season and, as ever, the sparks fly between our two leads. How cool is that?<br /><br />As we saw in the Season 5 closer, our crime-solving squints have scattered to the winds. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth has been recalled to active military duty. Dr. Brennan is traipsing thru Indonesia in search of man's true origins. Hodgins and Angela are in France. And the heart-broken Sweets had gone on sabbatical and become a goateed piano player in some bar. It would take seven months and Dr. Cam Saroyan's dire straits at the Jeffersonian Institute to reunite the old gang. The Season Six opener (\\"The Mastodon in the Room\\") reminds us that Bones can still deliver a smackdown as she wipes the jungle floor with a crew of armed guerrilas.<br /><br />Six seasons into it, BONES is still my favorite show on television. I'm still savoring that blend of police procedural, slightly futuristic forensics, terrific humor, and addictive relationship drama. I don't know how the showmakers keep coming up with interesting ways to present the icky corpse. Agent Booth and the squints from the Jeffersonian Institute take on challenging cases, whether it's a homicide victim found in a giant chocolate bar (\\"The Babe in the Bar\\") or one mauled by the mythical chupacabra (\\"The Truth in the Myth\\") or one grounded up in the pin setting machine of a bowling alley (\\"The Change in the Game\\") or melted into the dashboard of an exploded truck (\\"The Twisted Bones in the Melted Truck\\").<br /><br />There are several pivotal episodes. In \\"The Mastodon in the Room,\\" Booth confesses to Brennan he's in love with a lovely investigative reporter he met during his recent Army tour. This new relationship dynamics would have Brennan reassessing her own feelings for Booth. In \\"The Doctor in the Photo,\\" Brennan is strangely affected by a murdered cardiac surgeon who resembles Brennan in uncanny ways. This episode would also give us the half-Latin, half-gibberish phrase \\"Ipso facto Columbo Oreo,\\" which I love. \\"The Bullet in the Brain\\" features the return of the Gravedigger and introduces this season's recurring big bad, a vigilante sniper from Booth's military past. In the bottle episode \\"The Blackout in the Blizzard\\" a blizzard cuts off power city-wide and confines Booth and Brennan in an elevator and the squints at the lab while still having to investigate a case involving a potential viral outbreak. \\"The Hole in the Heart\\" offers the resolution (for now) of Booth's pursuit of the vigilante sniper. \\"The Change in the Game\\" is the season finale and drops one of those awesome reveals that makes you go \\"What the what?!!\\" Meanwhile, \\"The Signs in the Silence\\" may be the most emotional, tearjerky episode of this season as the squints attempt to dig into the past of an abused deaf/mute teenaged girl who may have committed a fatal stabbing.<br /><br />Less pivotal but very fun are \\"The Shallow in the Deep,\\" which has Booth, Bones, and Sweets ending up on a cougar cruise while following leads to a murder, and \\"The Body in the Bounty\\" guest-stars David Alan Grier as the \\"amazing\\" Professor Bunsen Jude \\"The Science Dude\\" who asks Bones to go on his kid's television science show if he acquits himself well as the intern in her current case. Speaking of which, the oddball cast of rotating \\"squinterns\\" is back, and it's neat that the show's writers have given them even more back story. I also appreciated that Booth's new girlfriend, Hannah, is treated as a believable character instead of, say, being stereotyped as the predictable witch. I like that Hannah and Bones - and, for that matter, Hannah and Booth's young son - are good friends.<br /><br />In Emily Deschanel's hands, Dr. Temperance Brennan continues to be a wonderful character. Bones is still socially awkward, still unfailingly blunt, is at all times literal. But she's still trying. And she's progressed far enough that she's even trying to crack jokes (bad jokes, excruciatingly unfunny jokes, but that's not the point). Deschanel allows you to see the painful vulnerability in Bones and the heart beneath the icy, abrasive surface. Deschanel and Boreanaz's chemistry continues to be unbeatable. For those who've been keening for progress in the \\"Will they, won't they?\\" department, several episodes address this concern.<br /><br />Six discs to this complete Season 6 Collection containing all 23 episodes. Bonus stuff as follows:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary on 2 episodes: \\"The Doctor in the Photo\\" (with Hart Hanson, Stephen Nathan and Jan Toynton) and \\"The Blackout in the Blizzard\\" (with David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel)<br />- Two Extended Episodes (\\"The Daredevil in the Mold\\" & \\"The Bikini in the Soup\\")<br />- \\"Breaking Down: The Blackout in the Blizzard,\\" an episode directed by David Boreanaz (00:08:12 minutes long)<br />- The Visual Effects of BONES (00:11:39 minutes)<br />- Gag Reel (00:04:23 minutes)<br />- THE KILLING pilot episodes the predictable witch.

Eager to learn more about my mother-country and its prophet, I picked up Mandela's famous autobiography.  Having never read an autobiography before, I did not really know what to expect.  All I can say is wow, this book is nothing short of amazing.  The amount of detail is perfect, not too much - not too little.  The pace is excellent, I didn't want it to end.  But above all is Madiba's story: Truly inspiring and incredible.  His combination of selflessness, dedication, and intellect are qualities that are mixed so perfectly that we are lucky as people to have him as one of our own.

1861085257|5.0|Once again, Angie Scarr has given excellent instructions for making dollhouse foods the way she does.  She shows how to make even the tiniest detail.  An example would be a head of cabbage with ribbing and veining so that it looks very real.  Many of her items need a second look to notice that they are not the actual food.<br />This book is for the more advanced polymer clay miniaturist.  While Ms. Scarr gives amazing direction, she doesn't tell how to make all the colors.  She suggests the reader look to the actual food for variances in coloring.  She encourages observation on the part of the miniature food maker so they can utilize the skills taught herein to apply to whatever other items they may want to make.<br />The majority of the book is on caning.  There is also much use of the Skinner technique, which she explains how to do.<br />I highly recommend this book to those who want to make high quality foods for their dollhouse, display or to sell.

Then Rovio got greedy and pretty much ruined the game with the most disrupting ads ever seen in an Android app.  Now they finally (a year or two late) release the paid version everyone has been asking for from the start, most likely because ad revenue has started to decline, and I'm supposed to reward them by handing over my 99 cents?

B005G4TJI4|5.0|I agree with a previous poster on the special features for this disc: nada. This film is one in which I'll make an exception about not having special features with it, though. There's no way I can penalize this movie for leaving out the special features because it delivers, no, over delivers on being what it states, and that is an action movie, a VERY BIG action movie. The little kid in me doesn't want to know how they did it. That's how much I enjoyed this film, as the review on its cover says \\"the greatest action movie ever made,\\" after the movie ended and even as I write this, I can't think of one greater, not even Avatar, which boasted being the most technically complex film made, after seeing this film, I don't know.<br /><br />But I will say that I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. There were a few lags, some throw-in comedy relief provided by Sam's parents and a couple of small ugly robots, a subplot about Sam trying to land a job, love interest, jealousy, etc. I did get a kick out of John Malkovich as one of Sam's employers, very funny.<br /><br />The plot was simple and for those who haven't seen it I won't give much away by telling you that the axis of this film involves the Deceptacons' ongoing attempt to take over earth, this time with the help of Sentinel Prime, former leader of the autobots. The difference between the prior films and this one are the scales on which these battles are waged. This one's outsized in comparison, everything's gargantuan. In fact, out of all three films, this one's my favorite and delivers all I ask of this type of film: action, giant robots, and unbelievable effects.<br /><br />What I really respect about this movie that it is what it is. It's not trying to save the rain forests, it's not out to change the world or revolutionize the way I see movies. All it's trying to do, did, and will do again tonight, is entertain the hell out of me for a couple of mindless hours. I can appreciate this. It's pricey, though, at 29 bucks.

B00511ONPG|5.0|FB is not new to me, but I needed some expert advice on how to promote and market a business. There are online courses that are available at a cost many times more than this book. An online course is like reading a book with quizzes. This was my first Kindle purchase and I researched other books available on this topic. After reading Likeable Social Media and getting some valuable information, I was satisfied with my purchase.  What really impressed me most is when I had a question. I sent Dave (the author) an email on a Sunday morning, and got an answer in less than 5 minutes. He also gave me his cell phone and work #s and said to call anytime.

1439170916|5.0|This is an amazingly well-written and enthralling book that details the evolution of cancer and the methods for treating and preventing it. The battles fought by researchers and those stricken with the disease are monuments to fortitude and perseverance. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is technical, but easily understood. Most importantly, it is not morbid, but rather uplifting. The successes are cause for celebration and the failures are motivation for further efforts. With increased scientific abilities in the field of gene-mapping, we may see some accelerated success in the treatment and prevention of cancer.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I recently decided to reread The Moonstone, a classic of Victorian fiction by Wilkie Collins. One of my online reading groups chose to read it because it is available free as an ebook these days, so it seemed to them like a good \\"recession buster.\\" That got me to thinking maybe I'd join them with this particular book (though, much as I love my Kindle, I read my aged, yellowed paperback priced originally $1.45). I could only dimly remember the plot since I last read it as a teenager. T.S. Eliot called it \\"the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels.\\" That seemed like a good recommendation, and I am in the midst of laying out the plot to my own mystery, so studying a master would be good inspiration, and he certainly was.<br /><br />What fun to reread this book! I'm afraid I neglected my own writing for a day or two. I certainly learned some good tricks. For example, Collins invents multiple ways for critical information to be kept from the necessary characters for unconscionably long tracks of time. No quick resolutions here. Sometimes you need to hold off letting the cat out of the bag, and I got plenty of ideas in that regard. He plants clues masterfully, sometimes letting them hide in plain sight, sometimes carefully drawing attention to them but cloaking their true significance behind layers of false assumptions.<br /><br />But the greatest enjoyment for me about this venerable book lay in the personality of the narrators. Collins uses the conceit that one of the main characters has requested reports from each of the key witnesses to the various stages of the remarkable episode of the Moonstone, an exotic diamond originally stolen from India. In this way, Collins creates interest in his long book by changing who tells us the action, but it's more than variety that intrigues. Each narrator is built into a richly developed character. Their ways of understanding the people and events contribute to the engaging quality of the novel. After a brief Prologue \\"extracted from a family paper\\" that gives the Indian background, we hear from Gabriel Betteredge, the aged and delightful house-steward of the grand country home where the main strand of the mystery begins. He's impossible not to like, even while we chuckle at his set notions. Did you know Robinson Crusoe is an eternal fount of wisdom for all of life's difficulties, a true prophetic document? We'll hear from the spinster aunt Miss Clack, Mr. Bruff, a clever and worldly solicitor, Franklin Blake, the romantic hero of the book, Ezra Jennings, an outcast physician with Gypsy bloodlines, and Sergeant Cuff, an early example of the brilliant and eccentric detective (but there's a twist with his brilliant conclusions). Collins has fun with his story-tellers. Their blindnesses, prejudices, and humanity are all on display. We are invited to assume a superior stance to their limitations, but that, of course, is only part of the ploy. Dear reader, you will discover your own limitations as you read! But you'll also laugh at the foibles and idiosyncrasies of each narrator in turn. This is a winding, complex tale with a heart and a conscious.<br /><br />Collins is remarkably forward thinking for a Victorian. The do-gooder Miss Clack, who is always out to save another Christian soul, is portrayed as remarkably small-minded. Her version of religion, a parody of what we sometimes imagine of the Victorian era, does not shine as a beacon of love and charity. Nor do those characters who immediately suspect evil of all dark skinned \\"Orientals.\\" Nonetheless, Collins's portrayal of India is decidedly un-PC, as much as his view is enlightened for his day. You'll have to accept the historical moment from which he wrote. I found it interesting in light of our current East-West dichotomy that so often underlies the way we approach issues without our being fully conscious of it. The Victorians were, after all, only carrying on a tradition of bigotry against the East started by the Athenians in the 5th Century B.C.E. History has its uses on the road to enlightenment.<br /><br />And, it turns out, Victorian mysteries have their pleasures. Sometimes the best things in life are indeed free.

Especially a ring that can reproduce any man made object on the planet?<br />This film wasn't as action packed as the review on the back cover indicates. However, it was entertaining. If you can suspend your belief in reality for 114 minutes, you might enjoy this film.<br /><br />The way Lantern's origin was presented had a lot of holes in it's logic. In the original origin of Green Lantern (the 60's version); he gets his powers from an alien who has crash landed. In the modern movie version a ball of green light swoops up Hal Jordan out of nowhere, with no explanation, to the crash site.<br /><br />It's a confusing story. The Green Lantern Corps aspect of the story was too much for the uninitiated.  While it presented some exciting looking visuals, it was a too disjointed for me. The alien threat to planet earth unfolded a too predictably.  Watching Tim Robbins (as the Senator) and Angela Basset  the scientist) just made me cringe. They deserved a lot better than the secondary roles in this film. The dialogue they had to speak was very clich&eacute; ridden material fans have heard in hundreds of movies.  If you can ignore the silliness of the script, it's still a fun little movie.<br /><br />The climax of the film makes it worth your wait.  The monster was a shapeless mass that I've never seen before; unless he's part of the new comics.  The creature looks like a giant.....well, you'll come to that conclusion when you see it.  When you see the end, you'll be just as confused as I am. The DVD should have came with a guide to the leaders in the Green Lantern Corps.  If you follow the comics, you won't have to wonder who all the players are.<br /><br />If you bother with DVD extras; The Cartoon Network has a preview of The Green Lantern CGI cartoon series.  Had the producers gone with a cartoon instead, it might have been more successful.  The snippets in the preview show much better characters and scenes than the live action movie. I anticipate the animated series much more than Green Lantern 2.s than the live action movie. I anticipate the animated series much more than Green Lantern 2.

B005K8QIS0|2.0|After viewing the first of three two-hour episodes of \\"Case Histories\\" on PBS tonight, I am left feeling incredibly frustrated, angry and disappointed.  Tonight's episode was adapted from Kate Atkinson's first novel featuring private detective Jackson Brodie, entitled \\"Case Histories\\". I had looked forward to it for months, believing that book to be the best of the three being televised by PBS.   As an avid reader, I've grown used to my favorite books being carelessly retold and poorly cast in order to fit a budget, employ a popular actor, or conform to a time frame.  I expect plots to be abbreviated and characters to be excised.  But why on earth was it necessary to change such essentials of plot and character motivation so that one murder is actually committed by someone completely different?  Was it deliberate that terribly important facts were left so murky that if you hadn't read the book before viewing the program, you'd have no bloody inkling as to what had just happened?    And was it just carelessness to have the actors speak their lines with their mouths full of food?  Their lines are tricky enough to catch when spoken with a Scottish accent, under and through ambient noises such as traffic and cutlery clattering.  But please-- have some pity on viewers, painfully straining to catch plot points while Mr. Isaacs chews and spews his pizza!    Beautiful shots of Edinburgh abound, but can't make up for the confused story-telling here.  Such a waste!  Needless to say, I plan to skip the rest of this series and reread the novels instead.    I would be interested in knowing how much Ms. Atkinson was consulted in the making of this sorry program.  It's obvious that showcasing her ability to create an affecting and satisfying narrative was a low priority.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ok, first off... yes, I'm a fanboy, but I'm gonna try to be as objective as I can about this. Like many other folks here have said before, this is a review about the PRODUCT...not the MOVIES. I've been a Star Wars fan since I can remember, and like many people out there, I disagree with many of the changes done to these movies over the years, particularly Greedo shooting first (with now is pretty much Han and Greedo shooting at the same time) and the Jedi Rocks scene in ROTJ. Anyway, may people here seem to have rated this box set because  of the new changes (and of course because it does not include the unaltered movies). Honestly, none of the new changes bothers me to the point of ruining the movie experience. Sure, Vader yelling NOOO at the end of ROTJ feels a little weird now, but trust me, you'll get used to it over time. Same as we all did to Luke screaming as he falls down in TESB after losing his hand.... that scream that seemed to be the exact same scream used for the emperor in ROTJ...of course it was eventually removed, but yo know what I mean  That's not justifying the added NOOO to the scene. Personally I think it was better with no scream, but it's not that bad. Really. You gotta focus on both the positive things in this set as well as the negative. The PQ is absolutely amazing. TPM looks as if it was filmed this year. All movies look beautiful!!. There's plenty of bonus material. The artwork is really great. I remember many people complaining that the artwork in the dvd versions was just a crappy photoshop work (and I agree). But now we get this beautiful painting of both Anakin and Luke on Tatooine. I just love it....no to mention that the box itself is A LOT better than the thin box of the 2004 dvds. The menus were more fun on the dvds, but now they are more straightforward...no animation every time you click anything. The SQ is also amazing. I'm sorry I'm not very technical on this review but I can only give a regular consumer's point of view for this.  So, bottomline... I recommend this set to anyone who loves star wars. You won't regret it!... There are A LOT of great things in this set, and the \\"bad\\" things are jut minor stuff that won't ruin the experience at all!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Brillant story telling.Visual effects are fantastic with great entertaining actors...Worth watching again and again as there is alot of detail in the artwork and special effects.
0143034901|5.0|I was drawn into this story from the first page... Couldn't put it down. I don't use this description for much, but this book is extremely well-crafted from beginning to end. The words drip like honey -- Beautifully written.<br />I love how the life of the main character, Daniel, becomes intertwined with and reflective of the life of the man he his searching for -- Carax.<br />Excellent development of individual characters whose lives intertwine in ways you don't anticipate as you first get to know them.<br />What I especially loved is that the story was well resolved. There were no loose ends at all, even for the minor characters. The secrets that needed to be revealed were revealed, and the secrets that needed to be kept were kept.<br />After reading the last page I put down this book with a feeling of satisfaction.<br />One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B001OGPTZ0|5.0|Seriously this album is way awesome. Any fan of STP or rock music in general should pick this up. Interstate Love Song is an instant classic by any measure, along with this whole album.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|If you love period films you'll love this one!  The costumes, locations, acting are some of the best I've ever seen.  This is one of my favorite films ever!  Impressive that it's free with my Amazon Prime membership!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|If you're a Michael Connelly fan (and who isn't!) you'll love Suicide Run: Three Harry Bosch Stories. Harry Bosch is an LAPD Detective and the protagonist of many of the Connelly books. Connelly is a former newspaper crime reporter so his writing is fast, crisp and to the point. These three short stories are about crimes, criminals and the cops who deal in this world. They are exceptional short stories that make you cry that each isn't a full size novel. Connelly is the master of crime and the police procedural. These short stories won't disappoint.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|I have not seen the original `Tron' film.  Maybe that was a bad way to walk into this film, and then again maybe it was the best way.  My eyes were not blinded by the blindfold of nostalgia and I was able to judge the film based on its own merits and not those created by its predecessor.  And then again, some will balk that movies within a series need to be seen and judged within that series because some if not most is lost on eyes not familiar with the origins of the film.<br /><br />I don't see `Tron' as being in that boat since I could follow this film rather easily and so I don't think anything at all was lost of these virgin eyes.<br /><br />`Tron: Legacy' tells the story of a young man named Sam who is haunted by the disappearance of his father.  His father, Kevin Flynn, was a computer genius who created a cyber-universe of sorts and then suddenly vanished after leaving the lingering promise to take his son to that world.  His son, now all grown up, is a rebel of sorts; a young man swimming in the wealth his father left behind who has no desire to run his father's company but takes it upon himself to sabotage their efforts if he sees them conflicting with what he perceives would have been his father's wishes.  After a mysterious `page' comes through from his father's old office, Sam ventures into the unknown as he is sucked into the world behind the screen, the world his father created but that has now become trapped in the chaos surrounding the enthronement of Kevin's own creation; Clu.  Clu is the evil doppelganger of Kevin Flynn, a dangerous force determined to travel into the real world.  The only way that he can do that is to enter the portal using a special disc resting on Kevin's back.  Kevin has thus been in hiding, dwelling in the outskirts of The Grid with a young woman, a miracle of sorts, who has proved to be his guardian angel.  Sam now has to help his father defeat Clu before the rest of the world suffers at his tyranny.<br /><br />To say that this film is hollow would be an understatement.  There really isn't any depth at play here.  That doesn't mean that the film isn't fun, because it excels in that department.  In fact, the film is a visual feast and I must admit to being blindsided by that.  When I initially saw the trailer for the film I was unimpressed.  The dark color palate just seemed so monotonous and I was expecting to be bored by the film's framing, but what I found was rather stellar.  The scenes are expertly framed.  The cinematography is exciting and bold and the blacks and bright lights complement each other flawlessly.<br /><br />The acting is decent.  Olivia Wilde has never looked better (and I mirror the sentiments that that shot of her lounging on the couch is THE still of the year) but she doesn't do much.  Bridges phones it in, Sheen oversells it (but he's fun) and Hedlund just looks happy to be there (but he has talent, it's just not on display here).  The script is lazy and formulaic (and there are some plot points that are never thought through fully, especially concerning Tron himself) and really is nothing but an excuse for digital violence, but that is the best part of the film and the real reason to watch.<br /><br />Your eyes will be happy you invited them to this party.understatement.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I cannot review this set, as it has not yet been released.  But I can tell others that it is well worth the wait.  Here in the UK we are on the 5th episode of 8 and are promised a Chrsitmas special as well.  I hope that will be included in the US version, hence the February release.  The story is set during World War I and there are some spectacular twists to the story!  Those you love and those you love to hate are all back, with some new characters as well. The scripts are very well written, Maggie Smith has some fabulous lines!  The costumes and scenery are again lush. I am enjoying this series so much I have pre-ordered this set for my brother in the US.  If you loved series 1 and got involved with the characters you will love series 2 which continues their stories.  It is a huge hit here and they are already talking about series 3, to be set in the 1920's.  Update:  the DVD set has come out in the UK.  I cannot know what will be on the US version, but the UK version has a section of deleted scenes.  Have a look at them, some bits of the story make more sense.  The reveiws here are mixed, as many thought it got too \\"soap opera\\" and predictable, while others felt it was unbelievable.

B0059R5Q08|4.0|I far prefer the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\" starring Ruth Wilson (\\"THE\\" best Jane of the past three decades, hands-down) and Toby Stephens.  That being said, I did applaud the Cary Joji Fukunaga production.  Unsurprisingly, the steamroller-like talent of Dame Judi Dench stole every scene as she played the role of solicitous, ever-efficient, and sentimental housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax.  Dame Dench is rightfully a British national dramatic treasure.  Mia Wasikowska's Jane was rendered in an appreciable fashion.  I recognize Ms. Wasikowska's acting skill to be significant.  While I felt she looked like the perfect Jane, I could not *entirely* believe her translation of Jane's tremulousness and resignation.    Michael Fassbender as Rochester I could not abide in the slightest.  The swaggering machismo and lengthy, blank stares simply did not fit at all with the figure of the dreary anti-hero from either the original novel, nor previous dramatic adaptations.  Far from being the mercilessly ambivalent and torn dark lord of the manor, Fassbender's portrayal came across as generally stoic and disconnected from the intense conflict that should have guided his character's role.  Fassbender's Rochester lacked depth, credibility, and verve.  A singularly poor casting choice indeed.

0062011847|4.0|It's the most novel-ey novel of the Discworld series, a final progression towards a straight story from the fantasty-based early offerings.  The overwhelming feeling I have is that the author is putting all of his Watch-related characters to bed; making sure they're settled, that they're future is set out - he's like a parent seeing to his children to make sure that he's done all he can for them.  Vimes is brought to terms with his status in life.  Young Sam gets a personality, and a future career.  Nobby finds his place, Fred finds a new view on life.  The Bad Men (all of them) are well and truly put in their place following the formula that a beaten enemy must know they are beaten.  All wrongs righted, the celestial music heard.  I personally don't believe that there will be another Watch installment - this feels too much like a fond farewell.  He's put a lot of himself into Vimes, and here most of all.  An enjoyable read of course, a fine book.
0439023521|5.0|First of all, I loved this book and couldn't put it down, so I'm giving it five stars. This book had me from start to finish, but there were a couple things that bothered me. There was a point where Katniss had the chance to take out a bunch of participants with her bow and arrow and instead she took out their food. This read to me like one of those horrible scenes in a horror movie where someone is making unbelievably stupid choices. You've got the killer/bad guy right there! Why not just finish him off? If your narrator is going to make choices this ridiculous, the reader needs more reflection from the narrator on his/her reasoning.   Also, the plot gets more predictable the further along you go. About halfway through, I realized there was no way Katniss would kill Rue and that someone else was probably going to take her out. Collins also bends the rules of the Hunger Games to adhere to plot, which to me seems a bit lazy. When the rules were changed so that two people from each district could survive, that sort of took the fun out of it. Why not make the plot more exciting by having only one winner and having the final two work around that? Seems like Collins was looking for an easy happy ending.
B00025ETIW|3.0|It's an OK album, but not nearly as good as Black Parade or Danger Days. If you like MCR, you probably already have this! If you're new, get the other two first.

B005GVA2L0|2.0|When I first heard the leak of \\"What You Want\\" from Evanescence's soon-to-be-released new album, I was mildly impressed.  They were promising a harder sound and more of a metal element in their music that hadn't been as prominent before, which I could certainly garner from an initial listen.  However, as the band leaked more tracks over the following weeks up until the release date, and I noticed that they all lacked individuality, my small cache of excitement plummeted.  Newbury Comics was offering a signed booklet if you pre-ordered the CD from them and, as I have done in the past with other artists, I figured I would purchase my copy so that even if I was disappointed (as my gut was promising), I'd at least have a signed booklet for my troubles.<br /><br />Sure enough, I received the album this past Friday and I was rather disappointed.  It seems that the conviction with which front-woman Amy Lee used to bitingly accuse via her vocals of a woman scorned have switched places with the frustration of the other members of the band.  Listening to their self-titled release is like trying to see Lee's beautiful face, but it's hidden behind her hair.  Her exceptional vocals are drowned out by the jam session in the foreground.  I never thought it was possible with Lee but I actually couldn't make out any of the lyrics until \\"End of the Dream\\", track nine on the CD.<br /><br />If I could describe this album in one word, it would be \\"cacophony\\".  It seems like a last minute mess that was thrown together for something to sell.  Each track blends into the next and is unrecognizable from its predecessor.  Around track eight or nine I was relieved, thinking that maybe all of the filler was uncharacteristically grouped together at the beginning, (\\"What You Want\\" excluded), but sadly, around track ten or eleven I was disappointed yet again when the remainder of the CD, (\\"Secret Door\\" excluded), sounded like more of the same from the beginning of the CD.<br /><br />With someone possessing such powerful pipes as Lee, I never thought I'd be asking, \\"Amy, where did you go?\\"  I couldn't really hear the lyrics that she puts so much time into writing, which is a shame because a band that used to sound so cutting edge now sounds rather boring.  I literally yawned while listening to it for the first time in the car on the way home from work.  I am hoping this is their bane of that one lackluster CD that lurks in every band's discography and that we'll have better luck next time, like Light Grenades was to Incubus.  Until that day comes, I'd rather listen to \\"The Open Door\\" to remind myself of the potential that Evanscence used to possess and that they can someday, hopefully, exude again.as Lee, I never thought I'd be asking, \\"Amy, where did you go?\\"  I couldn't really hear the lyrics that she puts so much time into writing, which is a shame because a band that used to sound so cutting edge now sounds rather boring.

B005ELQVGW|5.0|Seriously, you really need to listen to each song of the cd, which I like most.  Her past couple of albums have been disapointing, but I was surprise that this cd came out a winner.  Soller is the best song of the cd.
159562015X|3.0|The book Strengthsfinder<br />2.0 comes with an online test .... I didn't know when I bought the book that the test is a \\"one-time\\" link so the test was not available with the used book that I purchased ....  Not too useful ....
B0027BT75Y|5.0|This was a great mystery to read.  The story kept on track only diverting onto the characters personal lives for brief moments at a time.  The author seemed to pay attention to the small details which would later become critical in the story.  This is one of those stories that you can tell the author really thought the mystery through and created realistic twists and turns before revealing the real answer.  It's been awhile since I read a who-done-it that was this good.  Highly recommended.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|One of my favorite pieces of filmmaking equipment. It makes things so much easier when I don't have to lug around the larger camera and tripods. A must-have indeed.
0312430000|4.0|I was introduced to this book by two colleagues because of our talks about standard operating procedures (SOP) and best practices. I really, really push the idea of a 'run book' wherever I go - its a description of everything, including the kitchen sink. Yes, its a lot of work. But at 3am, its great to know the impact of repot9832 running 1 hour late and ETL-job33 dependencies before the VP gets on the conference call.  This was was an unexpectedly well-written book for non-doctors since the author is a famous surgeon and uses a LOT of medical stories to make his points.  As an Oracle DBA, we face 100s of different problems, using about 7 different versions of Oracle, on 4 major operating systems, in about 10,000 different system combinations. Each new release of the RDBMS product includes about 200 major changes. Each customer makes a few changes a month on 1, 2, and even 10 major systems inside their environment. Get the idea? No one has the low-level detail combos in their heads (be careful of the the people who say 'sure I know every single thing about every system, DB, OS, SAN, application, and network')  A great practical example in the book is the famous restaurant whose main chef says 'follow the recipes!' It is that simple? No! What about creativity? What about personal freedom? But - they do make changes, but the changes are after the changes are tested carefully. Then there was the example of the construction boss. I certainly want as much standardization as possible in the buildings I work in - don't you?  It is a good read, not too long, but reminds you that if using checklists can save 100s of lives all over the world, it can probably help your QA department.
0061205699|3.0|Widely regarded as a true American classic, I somehow avoided exposure to this novel during my educational years and have only a vague remembrance of seeing Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in the film version.  Only recently did I come into possession of a paperback copy of the book.<br /><br />Having completed it, I can say that by far its highest significance lay in its timing and the subject matter it tackled.  In my opinion, not only is the writing itself not noteworthy, but the dialogue is so exaggerated as to be almost satirical.  Being from south Arkansas, I'm familiar with southern dialect.  The extremes to which the author goes to convert the ordinary English language into pidgin \\"Southspeak\\" are wildly excessive.  In addition, there are several instances of dialogue attributed to minor children that are extremely unrealistic and age inappropriate.<br /><br />In reviewing this work, I find myself in the same predicament I faced when reviewing William Gibson's classic science fiction novel Neuromancer.  Written at the cusp of the technological revolution, Gibson's novel is startling in its prescience and cutting edge subject matter.  Read 20 years later, however, it necessarily suffers, having lost its novelty in the face of actual events.  It is nonetheless a monumental work.  Likewise, read 50 years ago at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, this novel would be \\"cutting edge\\" and an actual force for change, despite its faults.  Neuromancer and To Kill a Mockingbird lessen with age, one as a result of technological advances and the other, societal and cultural changes.<br /><br />While unquestionably groundbreaking and controversial at the time of its release, read 50 years later, these strengths and positive attributes fail to compensate for what becomes, by its conclusion, enormously irritating dialogue.  My rating is a reflection of the current reading experience and not any indication of the significance of the novel at the time of its release.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I waited for this movie to be released and I wasn't disappointed. I like the sweet, compassionate side the director showed Eli's character. Kind of nice to see a female (well kind of) sticking up for the boy. The book gives much more details about Eli, and a background that is important to know that might get lost a bit in the film. For instance why she asks Oskar if he would still like her if she wasn't a girl, and a camera shot of her scarred up missing tool box which wasn't the real thing (just an FYI for all the concerned people that was wondering). There's only so much you can put into a movie to make it for the ADD impaired. I don't recommend the movie if you you liked the American remake Let Me In. The original isn't made for the fans of Hollywood. If you like different, refreshing, good acting then this movie is a must see for you.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I am a huge fan of Mr. Sparks...I've read every book. I was so excited to read this book-which may have been my problem.  It seems that every one of Sparks' books have the theme; lost love and someone always dies. This book reminded me of the movie \\"Return to Me\\".  The ending was very predictable. Not his best work.

0553715038|3.0|This audio book is good, but not as great as I was expecting. It is certainly not worth paying cover price for. The accent in her voice is a little hard to listen it; it is very quiet mono-tone. She has some very good advice, but a lot of it just seems more lime common sense rather than a how-to type thing. I guess I was expecting more how-to type advice like on the tv series, supernanny or nanny 911. For example, your toddler behaves this way because of this and these are your options of how to deal with it to best fit the needs if your toddler. That sort of thing.
0385341008|4.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" falls well outside my usual tastes in reading. I only picked up the book because:<br />1. a friend recommended it to me,<br />2. I found the name intriguing, and<br />3. it was available used from our local bookstore.<br /><br />I don't have my copy anymore - I sent it on to someone else to read, I liked the book so much.  Then I bought a second copy of the book for a friend and a third copy of the book for my mother-in-law.<br /><br />This story follows a female writer right after World War II, who learns about the literary society quite by accident.  She uncovers the history of the German occupation of the Channel Islands. I don't know how much the author researched the occupation, but I like the details she added - enough to help the reader feel the horror and sorrow of the island residents, but not so much as to overwhelm the story.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book were written as letters between people, and they do a brilliant job of relaying the story. But then the author, Annie Barrows, died. Her niece took up the rest of the story, finishing the story as a traditional fashion. There is a clear delineation between the two authors, yet I found I had no trouble following the story.<br /><br />I love the characters in this story - Barrows shows people both at their worst and their finest here.  The island itself becomes a character in the story, with beautiful descriptions that did not overload the actual story with too many details.<br /><br />I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have two cheap tablets that do not run authorised versions of android, apparently.  One has a youtube app, the other does not, and neither access Android Market.  I got this app and use it on both.  The tablet without any youtube app gets the most from this, I just use this app to search and download the video and watch it.  A little more round about than I would like, but not bad overall.  I use it on both to grab youtube videos in advance for use when there is no wifi around.  I used them last week to show video examples of angular momentum and rotational bulging to grade school students that we were teaching about solar system astronomy.  There are some videos that will not download, but overall it is certainly better than nothing.  If you have an unsupported device like me, this is a good option.

B00479SVBU|4.0|This little MP3 player does a great job!  The FM transmission is strong enough to override static on the chosen frequency.  It has nifty little backlight that is not so bright that it distracts you when driving.  One of the cool things about this unit is that it always transmits when turned on, even if no music is playing; this lets you adjust the frequency by finding one where it can override distant stations without playing music.<br /><br />All in all this is a great little player; the only reason that I gave it only four stars is the remote; I have to get the remote about a foot from it and aimed at the top edge for it to work.  Once I found the sweet spot the remote worked perfectly.  I may get a newer battery and see if that helps, but for now the remote is okay and the player is fantastic!
B005LJITS0|5.0|The effects were really good and I loved the story.<br />Personally I think this is one of the better comic book films.<br />It's too bad that the problems with the digital copy have caused so many bad reviews as the film itself was really good.
0446547654|4.0|The Best of Me is a very different read to Safe Haven; something tells me that's true of all of Nicholas's novels. Despite all having a central theme of love, all of his book plots seem to be wildly different. It's impressive, actually, because most authors stick to a general formula for their books, but Nicholas doesn't and his plots range far and wide. The synopsis for The Best of Me doesn't give much away, as you can see above but it does rather sum the book up nicely as both Dawson and Amanda find themselves back in Oriental, their home town, after Tuck, a man they both knew well dies. Dawson and Amanda had been teenage sweethearts, torn apart because their lives were so far apart from each other and when they see each other again, it begs the question of just how deep their love really ran for each other way back when...<br /><br />The Best of Me is only 292 pages long, which surprised me. That's not particularly long, and I was surprised to see how small it was when I got it. However, there's a lot packed into the novel and it's a really good read. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Safe Haven, but it was a solid 4 star read for me. I'm a total sucker for love that's star-crossed, for love that attracts opposition, so I was sucked in by Dawson and Amanda's love and by the way they didn't let their contrasting backgrounds come between them during that summer they spent together. I liked how the intervening years didn't change their feelings for each other, too, once they both came back to Oriental. I thought the entire novel was just so magical as Dawson and Amanda are reunited and they reconnect over the death of their friend.<br /><br />I thought the interconnecting stories were also interesting - Dawson's cousins, Abee and Ted who were unhappy their cousin was back at Oriental, wanting to get back at him; Amanda's family, including her alcoholic husband Frank; the Bonner family, who are connected to Dawson; and the life story of the dead man, Tuck and his wife Clara. I found the way all the stories connected and were told were excellent and it really heightened my reading of the novel. I knew what was happening/going to happen with certain characters and it was interesting to watch it all play out while the characters were waiting to do what they were going to do. It was a very interesting novel, and I was particularly fascinated by Tuck's story. I loved how he had a hand in the novel despite the fact he died before we got to really know him.<br /><br />The ending was a massive shock for me. As the book neared its end, I pretty much knew I wasn't going to get an ending that was going to please me. Despite the fact I knew how it was going to end pretty much as soon as I got to about 20 pages out, I truly wanted to stop reading so I didn't have to read it. It was a very bittersweet read and Nicholas Sparks knows how to keep you turning the pages - even when you don't really want to. The Best of Me was a very readable read, and one I liked reading. I liked the whole love on from the opposite side of the tracks, the tragedy of it all, and I couldn't help wondering just how different Dawson and Amanda's lives would have been had they stayed together as teenagers. (It certainly would have been a very different book...) I'd definitely recommend the book, I enjoyed reading it and I can definitely see this one becoming a movie, too. I can't wait to go back and read Sparks' backlog of books he's definitely an author I enjoy reading and The Best of Me was hugely enjoyable.d the way all the stories connected and were told were excellent and it really heightened my reading of the novel.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|It really does the old school some justice. Reminds me of the older final fantasies. It's my favorite toilet game.
6305128952|5.0|It is a inspiring and most warming heartfelt story. I can't say this movie is a word to describe a material for our daily living.   Best movie to watch for my Physical Education, related with people who going through amputation.   Best,   MM
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Exactly what it says on the tin. Only two things I'd like to see : the ability to slide pieces instead of tapping a piece then tapping where you want it and network words with friends style play
B0043KK4N6|5.0|After watching the movie on cable about a dozen times, mostly for the music, however the acting was also great, I knew I had to have the album from the show.  It is very happy, uplifting music that can chase a bad mood away very quickly.  It's very well done and no matter Cher's age, she still has that very distinctive voice.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone who wants some happy music to lighten their day.
B003YUS64A|4.0|The Crocs Hover Slip definately did not dissapoint me, it was just as i hoped it would be. Stylish yet comfortable, this shoes were meant to be slip on on the go. It may not provide as much breathability as other crocs but it was comfortable, stylish, functional and awesome. :D

B003G4W49C|5.0|I had some very high expectations going into Ender's Game. The novel has been decorated with several awards including the Nebula in 1985, and the Hugo in 1986. To this very day it is considered one of the most intellectual and revered science fiction novels of all time. So needless to say, it has some very big shoes to fill. After reading Ender's Game I can safely say that it not only lives up to all its praise, but it's also one of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />The future depicted by Orson Scott Card is a frightening one. Humankind has been under siege by a mysterious breed of insect life-forms, crudely dubbed \\"Buggers\\" out of sheer terror. After barely surviving two catastrophic invasions by the Buggers, the world is under constant military martial law out of the fear of a third invasion.<br /><br />The military's one and only trump card for surviving the second invasion was the strategic prowess of Mazer Rackham. Due to his example, the military has made it their top priority to find promising new tactical geniuses and train them at a very young age. This is done by monitoring their every action and progress via devices placed in their necks. The atmosphere in Orson's vision of the future is very reminiscent of a totalitarian government, exercising its power by monitoring and controlling the population. The difference here is that these measures have been taken out of fear and desperation for the very survival and preservation of the human race. Which brings up an over-arcing theme that I found in Ender's Game. When the Buggers attacked, they didn't break our spirit or morale. They struck deeper, they destroyed our sense of humanity. The leaders are more then happy to sacrifice the childhood and overall happiness of children for the sake of the human race. To steal a quote from Mr. Spock, \\"the needs of the many, outweigh the few.\\" What's really disturbing about this is that we'd all most likely turn a blind eye towards their heinous acts if this was reality, it's horrible but it's unfortunately true. Yet the quote is really put to the test in this book.<br /><br />This brings me to the focus of Ender's Game: Ender himself. Orson Scott Card has been described as a very strong character driven author, focusing more on the individual's problems and how they solve them. In this case, it's a little boy with the fate of the world resting on his shoulders, no pressure. The protagonist Ender Wiggin is easily one of the most well realized and unique characters that I've ever seen in literature. From the very beginning, the military recognizes Ender as the genius child who has the wisdom and tactical knowledge needed to defeat the Buggers and ultimately save humanity from annihilation. Because of this, he is given the option to leave his family and join Battle School, an orbital station in space. There he is to learn to become a soldier and if he plays his cards right, will eventually discover what it takes to become a leader. At the same time though, he must contend with the harassment of the other children and the administration constantly putting the odds against him.<br /><br />One thing I quickly learned about Ender's Game is that this isn't some typical inspirational underdog story. From the very beginning to the very end, both the reader and the officers in charge know that Ender is the best there is. He showcases his superiority through his deep evaluation of people's mannerisms, strengths, weaknesses, and overall state of mind. Another large example is his tendencies early on to befriend people for the sake of forging alliances that he can call upon. Nearly every move Ender makes has some ulterior motive behind it. At times, it's quite disturbing to see these kinds of dark thoughts coming from a mere child. Which brings me to another point. As the story progresses and as he deals with more inhumane harassment from the senior officers and the other children; the child inside Ender slowly begins to die. His childhood slowly fades away, until there's nothing left but a cold leader of men. The exact leader that the military needs Ender to be. Yet you'll constantly be asking \\"was it worth it?\\"<br /><br />The supporting characters are also very well realized thanks to Mr. Card's prowess. The most interesting ones were Ender's siblings Valentine and Peter. The relationship between these three characters was very unique; the two of them acting as personifications of Ender's personality. Both Valentine and Peter were turned down as Battle School candidates for differing reasons. Valentine was to compassionate and humane, while Peter was to cruel and heartless. Ender fits in the middle of the spectrum, possessing their strengths but neither of their shortcomings. He possesses the kindness of his sister, but not the hesitation and mercy. From Peter, he possesses the will to destroy his adversaries, but not for pleasure and sport, instead he does it for self-defense. This causes Ender to constantly fear that he may one day become like his brother if he continues down the wrong path.<br /><br />Ender's Game is truly worthy of all of its acknowledgement and easily stands up today. It's a truly entertainment and thought-provoking science fiction story that makes you think and question our own humanity.
B005G4TJUC|1.0|Man, where do I even begin with this disaster of a movie?  First of all, it starts off with Optimus Prime narrating about how the Transformers came to be, as if we didn't hear any of that in the first 2 films.  Very bizarre way to open the movie.<br /><br />Hardly a mention of Megan Fox's character, after being the love of Sam's life for the first 2 movies, and knowing vital information about the Autobots. Now this new girl is all of a sudden privy to the information, just like that?  Weird, didn't make sense.  She could have been written in better. Sam's relationship is a very important aspect of these movies, but this transition was ridiculously done.  Horrible job by the writers on that one.<br /><br />There were WAY too many action sequences in this movie. Michael Bay, true to his character, just enjoys blowing things up in Transformers movie. He took it to ridiculous extremes with this one.  The final HOUR of the movie was a straight fight sequence!  I've never seen anything like it, in over 30 years of watching movies.  Sam narrowly avoided being killed about 760 times during the movie.  Yawn.<br /><br />This movie was a complete and utter disaster.  The CGI effects were pretty good, but you just didn't care this time around.  No character build-ups, too much action, storyline was hurried, just wasn't a good movie at all.  Please don't make a Transformers 4!
0385737955|5.0|I loved this book! It had all the makings of a great story - likeable & unlikeable characters, great description, originality. I am really digging YA dystopian novels lately and this ranks up there with the best. The idea of waking up somewhere and not knowing who you are is such an interesting concept for a novel. The maze just adds to the mystery.   Young Adult novels have come a long way since I was a kid. I remember reading Sweet Valley High and Christopher Pike novels when I was in middle school. Nothing like the choices kids have today. Also a good sign is that this book is just as enjoyable for an adult. I highly recommend this to anyone!
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Been a Ryan Adams fan since hearing New York New York on the Radio...Immediately went out and purchased Gold at a Record Store (remember those)..Played that thing to death. Turned on many friends to Ryan Adams..Bryan Adams? No Ryan...Fast forward 10 years and some uneven work in between (although some brilliance mixed in)..you have Ryan's new CD - Ashes and Fire...Ryan was nice enough to allow NPR to offer the whole record for free a couple weeks ahead of the official release...I sat in front of my laptop speakers and was amazes by this effort. The record contains 11 wonderfully written, wonderfully played, wonderfully recorded, wonderfully mastered songs. There isn't a dud in here folks (imo). Ryan is a weird cat. You would not know he is a heavy metal/battlestar gallactica freak by listening to his most recent work. The songs are very well constructed. Very mellow, even for Ryan standards. Great lryics. Very stripped down musically. Most songs contain just an acoustic guitar, bass, drums and piano. Stellar contributions by the enormously talented Norah Jones..(beautiful piano work and background vocals), Benmont Tench, pianos and hammond B3, and Mrs. Adams (Mandy Moore)..In fact Jones and Moore combine for some really beautiful harmony background vocals..Favorite songs are..Dirty Rain, Ashes & Fire, Do I wait (hauntingly collosal Tench B3) Kindness, Lucky Now, Invisible Riverside...Can't wait to see him when he rolls into Carnegie Hall in December..
0385738765|4.0|The Scorch Trials was an excellent follow up to The Maze Runner. It starts off right where the previous book left off, and dives right into the action. Our beloved characters are back, with the intro of some very interesting new ones. WICKED plays a much larger role. We also meet an interesting group of girls who have a lot in common with the GLADERS.   For me, the second book in a trilogy is usually the weakest...but this book was awesome. I am very excited for the conclusion.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I'm referring to the long wait to actually see the film. If I recall correctly, TTOL was originally slated for a 2009 release, then it was to be a 2010 release, and ultimately it became a 2011 release. I've been a fan of Malick ever since I saw The Thin Red Line more than a decade ago. Upon viewing, I've fallen in love with his films immediately, with the exception of The New World, which kind of went over my head the first time I saw it, but which I also came to love upon a second viewing years later. I didn't get to see TTOL on the big screen (it didn't play anywhere near me), and it's been a long wait to finally be able to slip the disc in and experience this film. There are so many images and words that stick in my mind even after a single viewing: the pain a husband and wife feel after learning of the death of a son; one brother crying on another's shoulder; a woman stopping to give water to a prisoner; one brother telling another \\"I trust you\\", only to have that trust betrayed; a mother looking back one last time as she is driven away from the home she has raised her children in; a boy asking of his God \\"Why should I be good if You're not?\\". This is a movie that I feel I must watch again. Some may be put off by the sometimes disjointed (and even strange) imagery, but as others have pointed out, it's important to keep in mind that for much of the film you are seeing a man's memories of his boyhood, and memories don't always present themselves in a clear, linear fashion, and aren't always entirely logical. This film is filled with moments of quiet grandeur, but if you're the type of person who needs something to \\"be happening\\" at all times and are too impatient to just sit back and take in a beautiful shot of a field of sunflowers, then this movie may not be for you. I know those who have been critical of this movie must be tired of the same old \\"you must be too dumb to get it\\" comments, but at the same time I hope they realize how weary those who love the filmare of the refrain of \\"you're just pretending you get it because you like being pretentious\\". In my humble opinion this is a work of great beauty, and while I understand that no film is ever going to be everyone's cup of tea, I still can't understand some of the vitriol heaped upon it. Very recently, while reading comments to a video on a video-sharing website, I came upon a nasty comment someone had posted taking glee in someone being injured in the video, and another poster responded with a question that stuck with me. Of those who simply cannot see anything of worth in this film, I'd like to ask that very question: Where is the light that is within you?
0545259088|4.0|I liked Forever better than Linger (book 2) but I Shiver was my favorite out of the series. I wish it had ended a little better and I'll miss the characters. I was surprised that I ended up liking Cole and Isabel. The Author's note at the end about not settling for less than a love like Sam and Grace's really got to me. I will probably read it again...when I get them back from my friends :)

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was beautifully written and the imagery is spectacular.  I love this circus and I want to go to this circus.  I very much felt a part of it all.  I wished for more character development.  I'm still confused about a few of them, why they are who they are???  I also wished for a stronger development between Celia and Marco, I really wanted to ache for their love and their dilemma.  I wanted to understand Bailey more, and I want to know how he and Poppet and Widget faired.  With that said, I really could not put the book down.  I read it all weekend, I enjoyed stealing moments to just go read this book.    Thanks Erin for a lovely book and an escape if only for a weekend!
B00005JKCH|4.0|The DVD arrived on time and played start to finish without issue.  The outer cellophane had been removed, a UPC sticker was placed over the original UPC, and the case was re packaged.  The UPC sticker was difficult to remove, but the anti-tamper seal was still intact so it seems the case was never opened.
0545265355|5.0|Since I have a 13 year old grand-daughter(going on eighteen), I am always looking for books that I think she may enjoy reading. I believe that this Science Fiction series will be a crowd pleaser for teenagers and young adults.  There is a little of everything: family, loyalty, personal relationships, problem solving, right & wrong, and of course plenty of weird sci-fi stuff too!
030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One is a novel built off many standard fiction cliches. Bleak future world where we've squandered our resources? Check! Impoverished, yet intelligent orphan seeks to rise up and claim an epic prize? Check! Band of do-gooders fighting against evil corporation? Check! Shy boy meets perfect match? Check! Story based off and dripping 80's nostalgia? Ch...Wait. What was that last one?  Ernest Cline has taken a novel that utilizes many standard tropes and crafted an entertaining novel that is a love note to the 80's. I became a teenager in 1985, have fond memories of many things from that decade, but I'll be the first to admit that it doesn't always hold up so well these days. In the novel, however, Cline's love of all things 80's was nostalgic and fun. I found myself smiling at the countless references in it.  The story is set in the 2050's where the Earth is a globally warmed wasteland where most live in abject poverty. Jim Halliday was world famous for creating OASIS, a VR system that everyone uses to access thousands of world built around all manner of subjects. Upon Halliday's death, he announces to the world via posthumous video that he's leaving his estate and control of OASIS to whomever can find three keys and unlock three gates hidden in the vast expanses of the V R system. He leaves a rhyme to give a hint to the first key and leaves behind a journal that chronicles his interests. He was also a teenager in the 80's so his interests were heavily rooted in that decade's music, TV, movies, and video games. With the prize being worth over 250 billion dollars, a sizable group of people hunt the keys, and they seek answers in the entertainment of the 80's.  So you have people 4 decades from now obsessively watching the entire Family Ties series hoping to find a clue about a key's whereabouts, followed by hours mastering Centipede, chased by watching Tron for the 18th time. The most obsessive are called Gunters, and they are walking encyclopedias of all things 80's. Quotes from random movies pepper the novel and plotlines permeate it. At times I felt like I was watching a combo of The Karate Kid, The Goonies, and Midnight Madness without the bad 80's cheesiness.  The story is told through first person through an orphaned, socially challenged fat teenager who of course becomes the first person to find one of they keys. He bands together with other social misfits and has to contend with the evil Sixers, corporate seekers who are paid to find the key for their corporate overlords and deliver the benevolent OASIS to an evil corporation so they can commercialize it and take it away from the poor. He meets a girl who is his perfect match and falls in love.  As I said, the plot lines are pretty generic, but the fun Cline has with his 80's set pieces is contagious. I found myself smiling a lot during this story, especially when I recognized a line from a film or when a challenge was rooted in a movie or video game I was very familiar with. There was nothing earth shattering about the story, but it was damn entertaining. I definitely recommend this one unless you despise the 80's. If you're a huge fan of that decade, get out and buy this book now.
0062059882|5.0|Was excited as can be when I heard about the re=issue and can honestly say it does not disappoint. My favourite version yet!
0792843584|1.0|Just watch, study, and learn and you will see how to make a bad 'Western' movie.  Back 31-years ago, it's hard to figure what exactly just what went wrong, but here goes:  bad script, bad screenplay, bad directing, bad editing.  What a long, boring film!  The incidental scenes were totally unnecessary; and added NOTHING to the film as a whole.  The whole thing could have been accomplished as a 30-minute short story, and that is problematic for the whole effect.  Just how long does it take to walk through a door?...or to put on a jacket?...or to mount a horse?...or to open a bottle?  The incidentals are what KILL this film.  I know in the '70's, that realism was the key to good directing and production; but one can watch and appreciate only so much 'realism' in a film, in a story, without wanting it to be concluded.  Christopher Walken looks like a 'martian' and will ALWAYS look like a martian.  He was the WRONG choice for Nate Champion.  AS for the rest of the cast, anyone could have pulled it off easily.  It's not a complicated story.  You're better off watching \\"The Johnson County War\\" with Tom Berringer for a more accurate portrayal of events.

B003UD7JEO|5.0|I really wanted to watch this show when it aired on tv but never got around to it, then it came out on blu-ray. I waited until a price drop before buying it, since I did not want to spend alot of cash on a show that could end up sucking. All I have to say is Im so glad I made the purchase. This show is awesome its takes place a couple of years after the movie. Nikita is plotting revenge on the agency she use to work for, over something they did to someone in her personal life( I do not wait to give away spoilers.) This show if I were to described it is like Jason Bourne, Salt, and Alias combined. When I watch the first episode I could not quit until I finished the disc, it was that addicting. The action and the way it is choreographed is awesome, the actors in the show are amazing as well. I cannot say enough good things about Maggie Q she is not only hot but she can also kicks some a@!. She does a great job of portraying a beautiful yet strong female character. The whole cast is great as well. I will say if you are a fan of spy-type espionage high action thrillers then this is a show for you. Please do not hesitant, buy it.

I know people have comments about the sound but really the babies don't need it very loud.  At first my daughter wasn't a fan but now she loves it.  And my son likes one type of music and my daughter the other.  Every kid is different so try the different options for music.  And it has lights!  Love it.  I am so glad I made this purchase.  I was well worth it and way less than the silly hand crank ones.  Definitely recommend it!

B005TPS0WG|3.0|The brothers barely make it out of their last run in with a Leviathan when Sam catches wind of a creature he dealt with in his childhood and leaves his brother behind to investigate. Seeing a younger Sam in his awkward years was a treat, but the pacing of this episode felt a little slow. I'm not real happy with what Dean did at the end either, as it felt a little... off, like he wouldn't have done this before the Apocalypse. It's possible that with everything that's happened at this point, he doesn't want to take any more chances. A decent episode and a nice peek into the early years of hunting, but not one of the best.
B004RCUJ9E|2.0|Other than that it seemed fine but I uninstalled before I messed with it much because of the no landscapey thing.
B005R9PBK8|5.0|A very exciting episode! Sam hallucinating posed an interesting and possible, but horrible scenario. The boys are up against an ancient foe with even fewer allies than before. They only have their wits and each other in the latest struggle against evil. Also, the bond between brothers is strengthened in a very touching manner this episode. They'll need it, because the list of losses keeps climbing...
B002C9ZHCS|5.0|I already have this CD but didn't know it but it's fine because I've played the first one so much, I'm afraid I'll wear it out!  So obviously, I love the music on here, love his voice and would recommend this to anyone.  It's wonderful.
B005P5TS5I|5.0|A great start to an awesome series. Julian Richings is a pleasure to watch as Death and he definitely doesn't disappoint this episode. Castiel has been warped by the souls he's swallowed and is on a power trip, believing he's setting things right. The Winchester brothers are at a loss at how to save Cas, desperate to stop him before all Purgatory breaks loose. The question is, how do you stop \\"god?\\" As if that weren't enough, Sam is having increasing difficulty functioning with the wall in his mind gone, the echoes of his memories in hell causing him to hallucinate. It's refreshing that the series is breaking away from the Biblical theme and is exploring other lore again.
B002YDRA22|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Up to a point, 'Taking Woodstock' really isn't such a bad film and I wonder what the reasons were for those people who positively hated it. There seem to be a group who were offended that Ang Lee didn't show any scenes of the actual concert or tried to recreate it by having actors playing some of the famous performers like Hendrix or Janis Joplin, singing their songs up on the stage. But what would have been the point of showing any of the actual concert scenes? If you're dying for some nostalgia, then you can buy the DVD of the original concert itself.<br /><br />There's also the bigger issue of the source material itself--Elliot Tiber's memoir, 'Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life.' Tiber's claim that he introduced Michael Lang, one of the principal Woodstock Festival promoters, to Max Yasgur (who owned the farm where the festival was held), appears to be completely false. In addition, the concert promoters did not appear to use the family motel as a sort of headquarters for their operations. Even if that didn't happen, it's not at all implausible that it COULD have happened, so I think it's fine that a little suspension of disbelief here does not damage the overall impact of the film.<br /><br />'Taking Woodstock' really isn't about Woodstock at all. It's a coming of age story where the music festival acts as both a backdrop and catalyst, driving the principal characters forward in their emotional journey. The protagonist, Elliot Tiber (named Teichberg in the film), is in his mid-30s and remains with his parents, pouring his own money into a run-down family-owned motel in upstate New York. They have until the end of the summer to pay off the mortgage or the bank will foreclose on the property.<br /><br />Elliot's problem is his obnoxious, overbearing Jewish mother, Sonia (well played by the classically trained British actor, Imelda Staunton). She portrays herself as a perennial victim of anti-Semitism and pushes her passive, goodhearted husband, Jake, around at every turn. One thing she is right about: the pretentious theater group that inhabits the barn on their property, is a constant thorn in their side as they're unable to pay any rent.<br /><br />The best part of 'Taking Woodstock' is the arrival of Michael Lang and his entourage of businessmen who intend to make Woodstock a reality. Jonathan Groff is perfectly cast as promoter Lang, the hippie-businessman, who maintains a constant beatific grin on his face while doling out gobs of cash. It's Elliot, in his position as the head of the local Chamber of Commerce, who informs Lang that he can give the promoters a permit to hold a music festival; the problem is that his own land is found to be a useless swamp. Elliot then introduces Lang to Max Yasgur, (with Eugene Levy also perfectly cast as the tough but liberal farmer) who has the perfect spread for the music festival.<br /><br />The first hour of the film proceeds seamlessly with additional twists and turns: Elliot tries to help Billy, a local Vietnam Vet who suffers from post traumatic stress disorder; Elliot's mother drops her objections to the Festival organizers staying at the motel when Elliot drops a bag of cash in front of her, given to him by the promoters; Lev Schreiber plays Vilma, a trans-gender Korean War Veteran, who's hired as a security guard, eventually warding off hostile locals as the hippies invade the local area; despite the local opposition, business people in the area (along with Elliot's parents) see huge profits from the influx of all the young people and Elliot ends up kissing a gay construction worker at a wild party, foreshadowing his decision to come out of the closet.<br /><br />At the behest of his father, Elliot decides to go see the festival himself and encounters a State Trooper who confesses that he was planning to come to the festival to \\"bust some hippies' heads\\" but \\"guesses\\" he's been sidetracked by \\"all the fumes\\". The trooper amiably offers Elliot a ride on his motorcycle through the backed up traffic, near where the concert is going on. Ang Lee wisely never has Elliot arrive at the stage area which was probably the experience of thousands who never actually got to see the event close up.<br /><br />Ang Lee interestingly doesn't sugarcoat the festival's appearance, as the weather conditions end up turning it into a virtual mud fest. At the same time, Lee views Woodstock as having had a positive effect on most of its participants. Elliot in particular, has a transformational experience, inside a VW bus with a hippie couple after taking a few hits of LSD. When he returns to the motel, Elliot realizes that his mother hasn't changed at all after he discovers that she's been hoarding money for years and could have paid off the mortgage long before he began helping his parents. On the bright side, Elliot's father feels he's found a second youth as a result of Woodstock and father and son find they're able to bond at film's end.<br /><br />It's clear that the second half of 'Taking Woodstock' isn't as good as the first. A big problem is that Elliot's internal conflict is not clear until the film's end where he recognizes that he's gay and must leave upstate New York and find a new life. The denouement might have been more effective if the second half of the film wasn't so slow moving. Particularly problematic are all those 'split-scene' scenes as well as the amount of time it takes for Elliot to wander off from his 'nest' at the motel, sojourn into the 'wilderness' (a psychedelic journey) and return to his cocoon, which is no longer the same.<br /><br />'Taking Woodstock' is by no means a great movie; but wisely the tangential coming of age story works much better than an unfocused tribute to anonymous festival participants.ycle through the backed up traffic, near where the concert is going on.

B003Y5H57O|5.0|We saw this in the theater last night. Incredible action, excellent special effects. Anyone who is a fan of the Kurt Russell version will not be disappointed. The director and writer did an excellent job of utilizing familiar parts of the previous movie while still putting original touches of their own on this one. Go see it. Great night out and worth the price of seeing it on the big screen, even though we have a big screen TV.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I cannot say I enjoyed every track on this CD because I didn't.  However, Mr. Bennett is superb as he always is.  Some of the highlights for me were: Amy Winehouse.  She definitely had a set of pipes on her.  Queen Latifah also does herself proud.  Andrea Bocelli is in perfect voice.  He has one of the most beautiful voices in creation.  And Natalie Cole was wonderful!
B004QX07G4|3.0|I was very disappointed with this big.  I love Ellen and always watch her show and enjoy her humor, but I found this book to be like reading in circles at times and I even found myself skipping parts of it when I felt it was going to be that way.  I am sorry to say, I didn't like it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Without a doubt the best keyboard out there for android. Word prediction is excellent. Price a little steep but worth it.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Disclaimer: I am giving this a 3 because I am sure this device works in certain setups and when I did get it to work, it was great, but ultimately for me it was too finnicky and has flaws even if it does work for you. I didn't actually order this on Amazon but wanted to give my review here and suggest picking this up at a store, because I think it's a \\"try before you (really) buy\\" so I suggest buying it at a store so if it doesn't work you can quickly return it and get refunded without having to deal with shipping it back and such. That being said, heres my review.  I recently moved my Xbox into a setup where I don't have much space compared to my old setup. I'd say I have about 5 feet from my TV to my couch, so playing my kinect requires me to angle it funny and tilt the TV. I bought zoom hoping I could use kinect like I used to, straight on, but was disapointed to find I simply couldn't get it to work.  First thing I noticed when I fired up my kinect with zoom on is it looks freaking cool, it makes the kinect look like some super robot or something which I think is neat. Nyko really nailed the aesthetic of this thing, it looks natural on the kinect and they used the same plasic and everything which is cool. But once I turned on my xbox I was disapointed to notice the little screen that shows sort of an infared outline of what kinect is seeing looked a little warped, it saw my whole body from a few feet away but was also detecting a bunch of other things and not really noticing when I was waving my hand. I figured calibration would fix it, so I went there in attempt to solve my problem to no results.  The first thing I noticed was the actual video quality with zoom is awful. Kinect is pretty low res to begin with, but the zoom made everything look significantly more distorted and pixelated. I doubt this is a problem for dance central or really most kinect games, but as they potentially more intricate it could become a huge problem. I got it calibrated to my room and everything seemed alright, but then I went to calibrate it to me and I noticed something, it wasn't really detecting me hardly at all. I figured I'd open up fruit ninja and see what happened, so I did.  Getting into fruit ninja my cursor kept jittering the entire time and the kinect would constantly try to make my leg the navigation. It seems as though the lack of fidelty makes it harder for kinect to detect what is what, which is disapointing to say the least. I went back to calibration and eventually got it to detect me after changing the angle a few times and replacing a lightbulb, I thought maybe I was good to go. Sadly this was not the case, I loaded fruit ninja back up and encountered the same problem I was having before I got it to detect me. I got into a game and it seemed to work alright, but every now and then it'd make a random slash near the top of my leg, a rather large problem.  The problem got worse when I put people in a couch behind me and tried playing kinect, the lost of fidelty seems to make it harder for kinect to detect who is who so it sort of makes everyone able to do anything. Without zoom, kinect is usually pretty good and choosing who is who and tracking only the actions of you and not people behind, but with this on it seems to really confuse it and it constantly switches. This makes the product unusable, so I decided it was a lost cause and to stick with angling the kinect and my TV oddly. I went to remove it and notice you really had to pry thing thing off, and when I got it off I noticed some scuffs around my lenses. They were all cosmetic and you have to really look up close to see them, but it's still frustrating and makes me wonder how nyko, a company who releases things generally of higher quality(I've used their Wii sensor bars and guns for years, which are decidedly more simple devices but both work better than the first party solutions), to release such a finnicky product that damages your expensive add-ons. I noticed amazon is no longer shipping these which makes me hope nyko recalled them and is going to maybe go for round 2 and fix it, although based on the way it works I'm not sure they can get away from the loss of fidelity.  Overall, I give Zoom a 3 because while it doesn't work at all for me, someone who uses kinect more when I have a few people over, I can see it working well for people who want kinect solely for single person use. I didn't try much more with it because I figured it was worthless but I imagine with some proper lighting and the ideal setup Zoom would work great. Still I need to discount it because it advertises as working with all setup and scratching my Kinect, which even if solely cosmetic is a major annoyance. So buyer beware...but maybe if you can get it to work it will be good for you.

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|The best Checkers game so far.  The gameplay is cool and I like the option to force plays.  The graphics are cool and the colors make the game look elegant.
B005DR64QE|3.0|Trespass was doomed from the beginning. Set to play the antagonist, Nicolas Cage walked off the set only to return a few days later to play the protagonist. The studio, showing little faith in the finished product, opted to give the film a limited release in theatres with a release to video-on-demand the same day and, to top it all off, set a home video release date before it even hit theatres and VOD. It doesn't help that the film reunites one of Hollywood's most misunderstood actors with director Joel Schumacher, who still can't escape the wrath of film critics and audiences for directing Batman & Robin. Trespass is another home invasion movie; a sub-genre that has been done very well (Panic Room) and has been done decently (Hostage). It is neither Cage nor Schumacher that is to blame for how this film turned out, but screenwriter Karl Gajdusek, whose only previous credits include episodes of the television show Dead Like Me. The idea and execution is derivative of home invasion movies that came before it and offers nothing new or exciting to the premise. Everything is by-the-numbers, full of clichés and idiotic plot twists, resulting in a predictable climax. Even worse, Trespass has stupid criminals and stupid victims making it hard to root for either one. With a brisk 90-minute running time it doesn't waste time jumping into the core of the plot though.  Nicolas Cage plays Kyle Miller, a diamond dealer who lives in a lavish isolated mansion with his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) and daughter Avery (Liana Liberato). Soon after Kyle arrives home, Avery has snuck out of the house to attend a party in an attempt to set up the suspense that she'll return when everything goes awry. Only 12 minutes in, the Miller home has been invaded by four criminals. The apparent ringleader (Ben Mendelsohn) wants Kyle to open his safe, which is believed to contain hundreds of thousands worth of diamonds and cash. The criminals plan to be in and out of the house in twenty minutes, butmatters grow difficult when Kyle stubbornly refuses to bend to their will. Meanwhile, Sarah notices something familiar about one of the criminals (Cam Gigandet) while the emotionally unstable female of the group simply wanders around the house.   Trespass is 90 minutes of \\"open the safe,\\" \\"I refuse\\" dialogue and overacting, the latter of which makes the film a bit more tolerable than it should've been. There's not much suspense because you can see it coming a mile away and when the illogical plot twist is thrown in all you can do is roll your eyes. Joel Schumacher has directed his share of great, average, and bad films and even if you look at the ones that linger somewhere between bad and average, he's a competent director that knows how to maintain suspense when necessary. Unfortunately, it never occurred to him or the two Academy Award winning actors leading the cast to demand a rewrite of the script. The set-up and execution is so generic that I can't believe anyone involved took part for anything other than money. Cage has done little to keep secret that he's not opposed to renting himself out if the fee is right. With such poor characterization and stilted dialogue, credit must be given to the actors for not sleepwalking through their roles. Mendelsohn brings to mind a young Gary Oldman, but anyone familiar with Cage's filmography will admit that Trespass may have been a better film if he had played Mendelsohn's role. Kidman brings nothing noteworthy to the role of Sarah, but there's nothing noteworthy about the character. Liberato is playing the typical daughter, who just wants to rebel against her parents and go to a party. The role is thankless, but the actress may actually have some talent that could be put to better use in a better movie.   Thankfully Cage is always reliable to make something entertain if all else fails and his performance doesn't disappoint. Cage has a tendency to go so over-the-top in bad movies that it's like he's satirizing the ridiculousness of everything; this tendency is often mistaken for bad acting. If you watch Deadfall or The Wicker Man, it becomes apparent that Cage is totally self-aware of the ridiculousness of what he's doing. Cage overacts in Trespass but handles the material more seriously than usual. His performance is fun to watch as he doesn't play it straight (he's attached a barely noticeable accent and plays Kyle in a very pathetic manner), but it doesn't save the film or add enough to boost it to cult \\"so-bad-its-good\\" status. Few actors play perpetually on edge as well as Cage does and he makes the film marginally better.  Trespass is not offensively bad; it's not a film that anyone will kick themselves over wasting 90 minutes of their life on. It's just a forgettable thriller that is so derivative of other films in the genre you may confuse plot elements of other films with this one. It's not an insult to the intelligence of the people watching it, but an insult to the intelligence of those involved. It's never boring, but it fails to create any plausible suspense and lacks the substance necessary to recommend it. It's not that better home invasion films have come before it; if this were the first, it would remain a mediocre effort.  GRADE: C
0553386794|1.0|I read all kinds of books, and I'm in no way an expert on the fantasy genre. However, I found this book depressing on many levels. All the characters are unlikeable, except for a couple of the children. I guess I really like a good protagonist because I found myself wanting to ROOT for someone, but I just couldn't. As the author kills of character after character, I discovered that I just didn't care anymore.<br /> Also, I have NEVER read a book with so much rape in it, and I really just don't need those images in my head. At one point, a raiding tribe pillages a community and a group of soldiers are raping a woman from behind while she is bent over a pile of corpses. I should have just put the damn book down at that point, but I was determined to finish it. I wish I hadn't. Never again George R.R. Martin. People ought to be ashamed to compare this writer to J.R.R. Tolkien. About the only thing they have in common is the R.R.
0385534639|3.0|The Night Circus was alright, definitely not as good as I thought it would be or wanted it to be. The author does a great job creating atmosphere and imagery, and the concept of a monochrome circus that only performs in the dead of night is alluring to those of us who enjoy novels with a bit of darkness and mystery to them. Unfortunately, the characters are flat, the love story is cliche, and the plot leaves the reader unsatisfied. If you read this expecting an explanation for the 'age old competition\\" or if you hope to delve further into the the background of the mysterious \\"man in the gray suit\\", you will be sorely dissapointed. The \\"rules\\" are mentioned countless times and end up being just as boring as the main plot driving mechanism: the mystery of the competition itself. The circus parts of the novel are well done and the settings in the novel are truly magical, but the plot and characters are dry and unsatisfying.   Bottom Line: If you care more about imagery and atmosphere than plot and character development,this may be the book for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.

B0042816YK|2.0|Alright, I know this is a total chick flick and I was hoping at least the parts where Julia Roberts's teeth showed up would be good enough. Yet not even her enormous mouth can save this mess.<br /><br />You can fast-forward the first 29 minutes or so as it's all slow back story. I did not and now I'll never get those 29 minutes of my life back.<br /><br />Now once Ms. Roberts lands in Italy the movie starts to come to life. The friends she makes in Italy and the scenarios involving food, gestures, joining soccer fans in Napoli and exploring Rome make for a fantastic movie. That movie I wanted to see.<br /><br />Sadly, as soon as that gets started it's over and off to India. Landing in India we get that helter skelter taxi cab ride through the bizarre culture shock that is the Asian subcontinent. Then the movie reverts back to slow as molasses boredom in an ashram. Sorry, I just cannot handle navel-gazing hippy nonsense. That whole section of the flick I did fast-forward.<br /><br />Then onto Bali where the story of Julia's journey actually started in the \\"fillum.\\" There it's pretty much hit and more miss as Javier No Country and her start a romance that is fine for what it is but involves way too much neurosis on Julia's part.<br /><br />So I'd say overall Eat is excellent, Pray is hideous and Love is just mediocre. Personally, I would have liked to have dumped Julia and stayed in Rome to follow her close friends--the Swedish woman and her Italian boyfriend. Now they were an infinitely more interesting couple than No Country for Bali and Erin Bali-no-vich.<br /><br />DVD has a director's cut and a making of extra with the director going on and on about how wonderful this tale was. Whatever, sell the movie to the converted who love the book but as one who did not read the book, this is not a good movie on its own. At least the scenery is most of the places was good to look at.

6301095294|1.0|I once bought a three-pack VHS collection of Beatle Movies that featured Hard Day's Night, Help!, and Magical Mystery Tour.  More enthusiastic about the other two--especially Help! because that's the kind of humor and plot I can relate to--I dragged my heels on MMT.  Fortunately, my niece watched it first and her verdict?:  \\"It's so stupid it's like a retarded version of Sesame Street.\\"  Mind you, she was 12 at the time!  Despite her warning I put it in, and it was the beginning of counting down the longest 55 minutes I have ever sat through in my life.  Weird, plotless, and boring, I only sat through the entire thing because--just like a lot of other reviewers here--it was the Beatles.  So?  Just because you love an artist, actor, or musician doesn't mean you have to blindly love everything they do.  Well, I definitely don't love this.  If you're a completist, I'm betting you only have it just to have it.  That's okay, because I do that with artists like Basia.  If you're not, beware unless you only want to see the musical numbers.  Hey, up until 1980 or so, I grew up without too many musical visual aids and let my own imagination do its work.  There's my advice for you:  buy the soundtrack and let your own mind fill in visuals to your individual taste.  Unless this is given to you or it's super cheap, I wouldn't put it in my collection.  It's just too embarrassing for such a brilliant group to have sunk so cinematically low.  Guess psychedelics do a body good, huh?
B004G600A4|4.0|I had high expectations after everyone told me that this movie was great. I think it was only great when juxtaposed to the other movies coming out with it.<br /><br />The story is sort of a coming-of-age film that follows Rapunzel. She has an abusive kidnapper mother who has taught her that the world is an evil and dangerous place. As she steps out into the world, she must deal with the trials of life without having any experience dealing with difficult situations.<br /><br />Her adventures are fun and exciting.<br /><br />The film features stellar voice acting and computer-generated graphics. The audio quality is excellent. And the musical score is mostly enjoyable.<br /><br />Where the movie falls flatter than it might not have is in its writing. The humor invoked is rather stale. The characters, although not flat, are also not quite engaging enough to make you fall in love with them.<br /><br />You'll probably enjoy this film, especially with your children. But don't expect Pixar quality just because of the CGI and Disney emblem.

Congrats to the author on a great work.  Looking forward to the next one.

B001TH44VY|3.0|Amadeus the original release version is superior. It won Best Picture the year it came out, and was a big hit. It also happened to PG, not un-rated with an exploitative nude scene reinserted which messes with the fine dramatic balance of the award winning big screen version. I much prefer the original cut released in the theater. It's not a matter of being a prude, but rather the original is superior in it's pacing and story telling.  That the Hollywood corporations release special editions, and director's cuts is fine, but please keep the originals available. George Lucas infamous mucking with Star Wars; Enter the Dragon adding some fortune cookie wisdom, with Bruce Lee looking oh so uncool, and goofy as he pauses and looks to the ceiling remembering in corny voice over insert his Master's advice; and the PG-13 version of The King's Speech editing out the story based profanity necessary to make a point about the King's therapy. These are on the short list of video versions inferior to the original films seen in the theaters.   In short Director's cuts, and special editions often suck. Not only that the originals tend to disappear. That these classics suffer with tinkering is a dis-service to some great classic films, and the movie lovers who would like to purchase them.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Loved every moment of the movies. Although I do recommend you watch them in the original order. Never owned the originals so having them on bluray will make a great addition to my collection.

So I bought this book Halo: The Fall of Reach for my 10-year-old, and he just got hooked of it. Honestly, I don't think this great book can be found anywhere and this kind of content in this book is the best way to get boys and young men to get hooked on reading. (Because most of the books are based on girl stuffs or baby stuff and boys don't like to read such a things.)So I would recommend this book to anybody who have boys and young men who love to read real adventures.

B005HI4LMS|4.0|\\"This has been one big misunderstanding.\\" Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) have hit the jackpot. Buying a vacation home they drive out to begin to fix it up. While out fishing they watch as a young college girl slips and falls in the water. When they go over to help her, her friends run away. When she wakes up she realizes that she is in no danger, but her friends don't know that and the set out to rescue her. This is one of the biggest surprises of the year. Easily one of the funniest movies to come out, and the only comedy/horror movie I have seen that can compete with \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" and \\"Zombieland\\". The plot and dialog are hilarious and will have you laughing at stuff you wouldn't normally laugh at, like when a kid is ground up by a woodchopper. Which is followed by the line \\"You ain't never gonna get that deposit back now.\\" For fans of \\"Shaun\\" or \\"Zombieland\\" this is right up your ally. For those that aren't you may still like this one. Very, very funny and the rare movie that you can put it and enjoy over and over. Definitely worth a watch. Overall, one of the funniest movies of the year. If you like \\"Idle Hands\\" you will love this movie. Gory good fun. I give it an A-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I absolutely would.<br /><br />*Also try - Rubber & Zombieland

B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Fantastic, great . The movie is good and 3D version are ok . I recommend it!! The experience om buying from my country Brazil was excellent .
B0018RWD1S|5.0|Excellent!! I like the bonus CD better than the original. Definitely worth the few extra dollars to get the Deluxe Edition!
B000T2EXXO|5.0|This is one of the albums that turned me on to jazz when I was young teen. I was lucky enough, growing up in Detroit, to have a good friend whose older brother was a guitarist with a great record collection- and Detroit's own Kenny Burrell was one of the jazzers he most admired. This album came out in 1963- 38 years ago!- and yet it still sounds hip and fresh. The title tune (Midnight Blue) is one that guitarists still listen to and copy, trying to get Kenny's feel and his phrasing. Five stars.
0316098329|3.0|I kept putting off reading this book because all I heard was how sad it was. Sometimes when I read things that are emotionally heavy, I just have a hard time removing myself from the emotions. But I finally got the book from the library because I didn't want to spend money on a book that I was hesitant to read in the first place. The story begins on Jack's fifth birthday and then goes on to tell the story of Jack and \\"Ma\\" who are being held prisoner by \\"Old Nick\\" in an 11 x 11 square foot room. The reader spends many days with Jack and Ma and learn that Ma gave birth to Jack while being held captivity in Room. It is clear that Ma has tried to educate Jack with the many stories she knows along with the television, but in order to protect Jack, she leads him to believe that the world is only Room and outside the door is outerspace. He thinks that what he sees on television isn't real and that only Ma, Old Nick and him are \\"real\\". 5 year old Jack is the narrator of the story and he calls everything in the room by its noun as if it were the name. For example...\\"We move Table over to beside Bath so we can sunbathe on Rug right under Skyligt when it's extra warm.\\" Ma is creative in trying to fill the days with activities with very little actual things...Phys Ed by running around the room or jumping on the bed, Parrot by repeating what was just said on TV, crafts with used toilet paper tubes, spaghetti, and old egg shells. Jack only sees Old Nick from his sleepint place in \\"Wardrobe\\" and doesn't undertstand the situation they are in. Finally, after some questioning, Ma tells Jack the truth that what he sees on TV is actually real and there is a whole world out there that they are missing and comes up with an escape plan. I don't want to say much else to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />There was so much hype around this book, especially with Jaycee Dugard coming into the news. I had very high expectations for this book, but they weren't met. At first it is interesting to have the story told in the voice of Jack but after a few chapters it becomes quite tedious. I got very tired of everything being named and the writing became dull. I started to skim quite a bit in places so I just got the gist of what was happening in the story. Like many other reviewers, I had a hard time believing that a child who could use words such as omnivore and quinoa and could do square roots had such poor grammar and speaking abilities. For example he said he got hurted instead of he got hurt. Ma did correct his grammar sometimes but for someone who worked so hard to educate him, it definitely was a deviation for her not to help him speak correctly. The escape plan was pretty unbelievable as well as the reast of the story. We were unable to learn much of Ma's phsychological state or the details of Ma's abduction and her life before Jack because of the limitations of having Jack as a narrator. There were other parts of the plotline dealing with Ma that were just skimmed and I would like to have read more about Ma's thoughts and experiences. It would have been nice to switch narrator at different times to get more detail.<br /><br />All and all, I am glad that I got the book from the library and didn't spend money on it. The hype around this book was just hype, the book left a lot to desire. The book was ok but if you want to read about the psychological impact of abduction and captivity, this is not the book.

1594202842|2.0|Chua fails to write an interesting book.   Her matter-of-fact tone is boring, and the subject matter is so much more her own creation than any sort of real reflection on Chinese (or Asian) culture. She obviously draws on real leaders in the field of Asian studies like Ronald Takaki when she tries to describe the progression of immigrant generations, but she provides nothing of any value of her own creation.  As a narrative, it fails to entertain. There is no conflict except where Chua tries to contrast her maniacal fixation on maximum success to the caricature of Western parenting which lets kids fail in the name of freedom. There is no growth, no challenge, and no truly interesting point to the story she tells. The book reads like a thesis with a singularity of concept but it lacks terribly as a story.  In the end, Chua tells the reader that they are unworthy parents unless they demand absolute perfection from their children. It provides no real insight into any family except her own, so it is impossible to judge the validity of her claim that she is not unique. Chua is bully, both to her children and to the reader, claiming that her admonitions are for our own good when it turns out it's really all about her.
0312330537|5.0|I must say this is the most wonderful novel that I have ever read. Don't get me wrong, I love my classics. But I must say this is just a masterpiece!<br />The story keeps you turning the pages AND the writing is just extraordinary. What a wonderful author, what an application in the writing, the structuring. What an effort into creating this story, it is just unique!<br />I can't wait for the sequel which is taking too long and keeps being postponed but I can't help thinking that such a book, takes a huge amount of work and Gregory Roberts is one applied writer.<br />You can't write a book like that in two days, can you?
0439023521|5.0|This book series is awesome! I ended up reading all 3 books in 4 days! I also gave them to my 13 year old stepdaughter who loved them as well! A must read! Also once you read the first one you will be hooked and want to read all 3. I would just buy all three to begin with if you can so your not waiting for them to come in the mail!
1416562605|4.0|I have read a few books now with India as a backdrop and I must say that they are wonderful (highly recommend Shantaram).<br />This book I found very raw and just so interesting. I was in it from the get-go and I highly recommend it.<br />I started reading the author's following book but couldn't keep interested. But The White Tiger is fantastic. READ IT.
0743298039|5.0|This could be set in any era, it is somewhat along the lines of DuMaurier. The story centres around twins, and their closeness. Margaret is hired to write a biography of an ageing, successful novelist. For years Ms Winter has lied about her personal life, telling a different story in every interview. She is dying and has now decided to reveal the truth, or so she says. The book narrates Margaret's journey in writing the biography. The suspense is well built, the story still surprises to the end. It is a classic \\"Gothic\\" tale, the protagonists isolated in a strange house, no-one quite what they seem, and so on. If you choose to read it - enjoy!
B005ELZKWS|1.0|As I listened to this album for the first time, I looked around for hidden cameras like I was on candid camera, or punked. I thought, for real? this album SUCKS! in a major way. At least the first outing had decent guitar work on it.   Let's break it down. Guitar: Satch is Vai's mentor. Vai wouldn't be caught dead on this album. My little sister plays better guitar than you'll find on this record.  Vocally: While I've been a Hagar fan for a long time, I think this is his worst work to date. more of a half rap-scat thing than singing, & Michael Anthony's Harmonies (for once) aren't there to save him.  Lyrics: half good, but so politically and religiously ladden it's hard to stomach.  I'd be disapointed if friends in a garage band put this out. For world class musicians, this is nothing short of mortifying!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Just love Duets II. Tony Bennett sounds fabulous. The songs chosen for this CD are perfect.  My favorite is Body and Soul - everytime I hear Amy Winehouse's voice, I get tears in my eyes. She was so amazing!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|It's not the slapstick pranks, like falling off of the roof while hanging Christmas lights that make this movie (although they're funny); it's the subtle jokes, like Cousin Eddie wearing a black dickey under a white V-neck sweater.  It's these jokes that make National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation not only a pleasure to watch once, but one to watch every Christmas season.  So, if you appreciate a good laugh with a smattering of good will, make Christmas Vacation part of your family tradition.     The movie opens with a car-ride sing-a-long while heading into the backcountry to harvest the family Christmas tree.  Mom and Dad sing enthusiastically while the children roll their eyes.  It's the relatable experiences like this one paired with the far-fetched antics of the Griswold family that make this National Lampoon's installment a success.  After marching in waste-high snow for hours, Clark finds their glorious tree only to realize that he has forgotten a saw. Gaffes like this cause Clark's ideal holiday to fall apart.    The progressively deeper dong of the family door bell announces the arrival of the extended family- Clark's parents and in-laws.  Their bickering is heard even before the door is opened and stories of bunions and boils spill over into the Griswold household.  Each of these characters adds a little more chaos and humor, but none as much as the surprise guest- Cousin Eddie.     Eddie and his rag-tag family pull up in what Clark describes as a \\"tenement of wheels.\\"  Eddie and his RV are a source of some of the best laughs in this film: whether it's Eddie's black dickie worn under a white v-neck sweater or his need to empty the RV's septic tank into the street sewer.  My favorite line from Eddie is when he informs Clark that he can't go sledding because the government had to change the metal plate in his head to a plastic one because every time his wife fired up the microwave, he'd `collapse, wet himself, and forget who he was.'    After a visit to the local sledding hill, we follow the Clark as he does last minute Christmas shopping, finishes affixing 150,000 light bulbs to his roof, prepares Christmas dinner, and reads The Night Before Christmas.  All events most Christians can relate to.  Of course, none of these go quite as planned, but that's what creates the humor.    Underlying all of the hilarity are some serious themes- Eddie is impoverished and can't buy his kids gifts, Clark has put a deposit down on a swimming pool banking on a Christmas bonus that never comes, and the family seems ready to fall apart.  Maybe the Griswolds aren't so fictitious after all.  These moments don't detract from the humor though.  They simply add that special Christmas spirit and good will we look for at this time of year.    So, if you're looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy while running here and there during the hectic Christmas season, try National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  You won't be disappointed.
0743435753|4.0|This novel was the next in the Honor Harrington Series that I wished to read, and was unavailable locally.  Ordered through an Amazon.com-listed used book seller; it arrived in good time and order, and matched the description given.  Enjoyed the novel as much as I have enjoyed previous books in the series.  If one likes space opera, one cannot go wrong with this novel or any others in the series (so far).
B003L77G38|5.0|I cannot put the amount of joy I receive from watching Fringe. The story lines of the first 2 seasons are set, and season 3 builds on and delivers a worthwhile season finale. Particulars are hard to discuss, since the show hit it's stride in season 2 and kept building layers and layers of story. The only real way to understand is to watch the series.<br /><br />The one good thing about Fringe is that the main three characters are connected, and all the events of the show are a result of the characters actions in the past. So every \\"Fringe\\" event that happens is a result of what a character did previously. This will not leave you guessing as to why these events are happening.<br /><br />Season 1, the show was finding it's legs. It started off strong, then went into a procedural path, then by the end of season 1, it found its direction. Season 2, the building and building continued as more revelations were revealed. Season 3 is the best of the series so far.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I am an avid gardener and trully appreciate the scent, color and varieties of flowers.  After reading the Language of Flowers, i now seek meaning and try to remember what each bud offering means.  the Language of Flowers is really a simple love story. The construction and themes are not new or original but to wrap them up in the contextual and figurative meaning of flowers makes it really interesting.  If you never thought much about flowers, this book will make you think twice and thrice the next time you are sending or recieivng flowers.  Good read, light, touching and quite botanically informative.
B005974CDU|4.0|This is a great CD,but,not their best.I think that Mike Mangini is a great drummer,and addition to Dream Theater.y problem is I think that Mike Portnoy,was more than just a drummer.He was a founding member and song writer.He was the heart(beat) of the band.I've been a fan since their first CD,So maybe I'm looking for something to dislike.However,this CD really ROCKS.Especially Outcry and Lost not forgotten.Just wish they could bring back MP.

B00062PN6I|5.0|These are great headphones. They've got a nice balanced output, good range, and sturdy build. I bought these for my video class in high school as I didn't want to risk someone stealing my $100 studio headphones. I used them for reference when editing and monitoring. After wearing out my studio headphones, I just started using these instead. I now use them at work all the time. For the price you can't go wrong, most companies sell headphones with the same frequency range for up to $100. If you're looking for a nice set of headphones for cheap, go with these.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is not a film for everyone, but I believe this to be one of the greatest cinematic achievements. Yes, it's visually stunning, but there is so much more. For the people who get discouraged after watching 25 minutes of it, or even finish the film but feel it was over ambitious and confusing, you're dealing Malick not Scorsese. Terrence Malik presents films that are meant to be watched over and over again because they need to be digested and reflected on. There are layers of metaphors and symbolism in what I believe to be his greatest achievement. It wasn't meant to be watched like 'Ordinary People' or 'Casablanca', dramas that are explained fully on the surface, but like '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It's a thinkers film.
B002N1AERI|4.0|This is a great album. I do not have any major problems with the music on here. I love the vocals and guitar work for the most part. But, for some strange reason the last song, \\"Design Your Universe\\" will not rip on itunes. I bought the cd at FYE, all songs rip except this one. It starts ripping but then freezes about halfway. So, I returned the cd for a new one and the same thing happens.Windows media player does the same thing. All songs play fine, including the last track, in my car, but the last song just freezes halfway through ripping.  Anybody know why? Thanks, Chris Donaldson

1554072840|5.0|I came to this site to order a new copy of this book and I'm so thrilled to see that it is still in print.  Mine has been used so many times and for so long, it's been taped, glued and stapled to death.  The little ones love to hear it read and by the time they learn to read, they giggle their way through reading it to younger siblings.  The little boy's name, Joshua, is so easy to read, but I wish a different name had been chosen for the little girl book.  Prudence's Mother is just hard to say.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  For people who have children who think the potty looks like a pitcher, I guess I've never had any child sit on one of my pitchers.  The child on the cover is sitting on this item, so half way intelligent children should be able to grasp the concept that this is a potty.
B00447G2T8|5.0|I have been listening to these guys for many many...well let's just say ever since the song \\"I'm Alive\\" from Keepers 1 was circulating. Throughout these years I have spent $$$$ repeatedly on their imports because some of their releases weren't available in the United States for awhile. But when I would get my hands on a new Helloween cd I was never disappointed. Not even with Chameleon and Bubbles. I was always impressed. I don't know what it is about them but I'm a pumpkinhead for life. I love everything about them (even if they don't pronounce some of the English words right). For example on Rabbit Don't Come Easy there is a song \\"Sun 4 The World\\" with the word \\"Tentacles\\" which Andi pronounces \\"ten-tackles\\". So it was kinda hard to take the song seriously when your laughing a bit at a mispronounced word (and rewinding it to hear it again). I still laugh at it. Still Love Them though.I can't stress enough to people on how much this band is underrated. I bet some radio airplay would get them some new fans though. Can you imagine \\"Are You Metal\\" on the radio? And yes I AM METAL!

B004WPYNY8|5.0|I have to say it is a great package of music. You can bang your head to this one without really stopping and that's what makes it so different. I have seen a few people say that this cd lacks something. It might lack some dead space and filler but it is all killer. I would however like a song like \\"The Odyssey\\". I fully recommend this to anyone who loves killer metal and progmetal music.
B005COO1X6|4.0|(Note: This is a joint review with Lynn O'Dell of RAR)<br />Michelle: I've heard good things about this writer and thought I might give him a shot. (Kidding.) I'd preordered it and had it delivered to my Kindle right when it was released.<br /><br />Lynn: I've been a fan of Stephen King since I was a kid. I couldn't pass up this short story. I, too, preordered it.<br /><br />Description:<br /><br />Michelle: Since the Amazon description is longer than the story and gives away pretty much everything, let me try. Pete Simmons, a ten-year-old boy, sneaks into an abandoned rest stop, while unbeknownst to him, all hell is breaking loose outside, due to a seemingly sentient muddy station wagon. The moral: Almost no good deed goes unpunished, unless you're pre-pubescent.<br /><br />Overall:  Michelle: 4 ¼ Stars<br /><br />  Lynn: 4 Stars<br /><br />Plot/Storyline:  Michelle: 4 ½ stars<br /><br />  Lynn: 4 Stars<br /><br />Michelle: You can't say that Stephen King doesn't cop to the resemblance this story has to earlier works. To quote: \\"Jim Golding hadn't believed in monster cars since he saw that movie Christine as a kid, but he believed that sometimes monsters could lurk in cars.\\"<br /><br />Stephen King has gone back to the scary-car well for, I believe, the third time. (This is not to be confused with the scary well well.) For the most part, it works. All I know is I spent most of the story wishing I could make various characters stop approaching the car, not to mention be able to translate the warning of a six-year-old girl. When she says, \\"It's sticky,\\" she means it.<br /><br />I have to give credit for the abandoned rest stop setting that allowed so much to go so wrong within close proximity of passing cars. Rather than this providing help, it seems to only serve to draw in fresh victims. The death count... is not exactly low.<br /><br />Lynn: Stephen King generally delivers some great horror. I have to admit that when it came to his depicting another scary car, I was concerned that it would end up as another From a Buick 8, the only novel of his that I will never reread and would rate with two stars. Fortunately, this one, while not reaching the level of Christine by any stretch of the imagination (pun intended), at least was a good read with an ending, though not a particularly satisfying one.<br /><br />I had a couple of small issues with the book. I won't go into detail on either to avoid spoilers. First, though I'm not personally familiar with the back of a police car, I'm pretty sure the rear doors don't open from the inside. Second, if something can roll somewhere, I would assume it could roll again.<br /><br />My larger issue was with the ending, which bordered on the ridiculous. However, I took it much in the same way I withstood the ending of It, the part with the asthma inhaler.<br /><br />Michelle: You make some good points. I didn't even think of the police car door thing.  You're right that King was reaching on that ending. The difference is that in IT there was a clearly established theme of childhood belief being magic/magical and even the adult characters needed to revert back in order to battle Pennywise. King does this a fair amount. Here though, he didn't quite make that link. He directly stated that the saving grace for Pete was his youth -- and by extension his ability to still believe the unbelievable. This saved him from making the same mistakes the adults made. That's different though from his \\"solution,\\" which seemed to be not so much about childhood magic as it was, well, science applied to science fiction.<br /><br />Characters:  Michelle: 4 ¼ Stars<br />  Lynn: 4 ½ Stars<br /><br />Michelle: King has always had a knack for introducing a lot of characters and giving us nice little snapshots into their lives so that we understand perfectly who they are and what they fear. This is a short story where he had to do this over half a dozen times. There were moments where the kids seemed almost too precocious, and Pete perhaps seems like he belonged to an earlier generation, but these are small complaints.<br /><br />Lynn: I loved the horse woman. She was vintage King. The other characters weren't as imaginative as I'm used to from him, but they weren't bad, either. My only character problem was with the six year old immediately knowing a ten-year-old was worried about alcohol on his breath.<br /><br />Michelle: I loved the horsewoman, too! I think Rachel figuring out Pete's concern was supposed to be surprising. Precocity by design, as opposed to an error in characterization. That moment didn't bother me as much as the rest, where I was simply expected to believe she was just old for her age. It reminded me  a little of our recent discussion of the Koontz book (What The Night Knows) where all the kids were embarrassingly perfect little forty year olds who discussed art and literature at the dinner table. King wasn't quite that bad.<br /><br />Writing style:  Michelle: 4 ¼ Stars<br />  Lynn: 3 ¾ Stars<br /><br />Michelle: It feels weird to judge the style of the author I've read since I was a kid in the late seventies. Ha, imagine being his editor. His style was, to be expected, quite good. If I'm being honest though, there were moments when it all felt a little rote.<br /><br />Reading King is like catching up with a friend, reconnecting with someone who has been part of my life since I was too young to understand the shower scene in Carrie. When I step back from this, I can say that this is not his best work, not by a long shot, and not even his best short story involving a child protagonist. (For that, I'd suggest The Man in the Black Suit.) Still, this was time well spent, and the price was right.<br /><br />Lynn: I have to agree here. The story was good and well worth the money, but the writing style appeared to be a little forced, especially the parenthetical interjections.<br /><br />My other problem came with the severe head hopping. I'm used to King telling his stories from different viewpoints. That's actually something I really enjoy about his work. However, in this story, he not only hopped around, he didn't do it very smoothly.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I would like to start by saying that I started listening to Dream Theater when Images and Words came out and I saw Pull Me Under on MTV's Headbangers Ball. I immediately bought the cd. Pull Me Under came and went and I said that song didn't seem that long in the video. I began to listen a little closer. When Metropolis was playing during the middle of the song (The time changes and goofy stuff)I started laughing hysterically and rewound it again and again. I then thought of it from a different point of view and how they could possibly remember all that stuff and play it live.THEY DID IT EXACTLY THE SAME!...I WAS HOOKED!...anyway I started drifting away from them after Falling Into Infinity came out....I skipped 6 Degrees all together and then saw they had ANOTHER one out called Train Of Thought. I said I'd bite. I Bought it and I was hooked instantly again. It still stands as one of my favorite Dream Theater albums of all time.I still throw it in the cd player or \\"ZUNE\\" that I have. A MUST HAVE for fans of great music.Oh Ya...I remember the sleeve inside having a distinct smell to it...something very different smelling.
0439023491|4.0|If you read my review for The Hunger Games you would know how surprised I was by how much I enjoyed the book, since it wasn't my usual \\"go-to\\" book. I also enjoyed the sequel, Catching Fire. Again, I found her writing style to be smooth, easy, yet descriptive. My only critique (possibly spoilerish, so beware) is how Katniss went from liking Peeta one minute, to Gale the next and so on, and so on.

1455803197|5.0|My daughter really enjoys listening to Rick Riordan's books on CD.  The reading level is a bit above her, but she can certainly listen to them, understand them and enjoy them without my help.  This is a much nicer alternative to watching television.  I also put them in my iPod and then she can listen to them when we are on long car rides or when she is waiting at an appointment with me.  The readers for this series are wonderful.  They have a young woman with a British accent reading Sadie's chapters and an American sounding young man for Carter's parts.  I often enjoy listening to these CDs with her before bed.  The only weird thing is that there are about 99 tracks per CD, which makes it a little time consuming to fast forward to pick up where we left off listening last time.
1416550550|5.0|Magical, magical book. Highly recommend. Could not put it down. Did take me awhile to sort out some of the characters, there were quite a few,and the flashbacks, but the chapters were all clearly marked with dates & location so it was not that challenging to go back and do a little research in the beginning until you got your bearings.   I miss this book now that I have finished!! It transported me to a different time and place. Twists and turns and a fascinating story. Fairy tales, too!! Loved it!!

He sounds just like I imagine Percy to sound.  I often enjoy listening to these CDs with my daughter before bed.  Unlike the Red Pyramid CDs, there are a normal number of tracks  per CD, about 15, so it is easier to fast forward to pick up where we left off the last time we were listening.  Also, the price on The Lightening Thief is very reasonable compared to the other audio books in this series.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I found Thor to be refreshing, I had never read the comic boos about Thor, but I loved the movie.  I got a feeling though it is going to be a part 2.  It was worth my money.<br />Good action and moves fast, great story line.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|So many reviewers have already paid such wonderful comments to this phenomenal movie.  I would just like to say that the screenwriter superbly adapted Stockett's exceptional novel.  This movie is one of the best adaptations of a novel I have enjoyed in a long time.  The themes of justice, perseverance, and survival never fade away.  This is why \\"The Help\\" is destined to be a true classic; both as a book and movie.  As another reviewer has already so eloquently stated, this movie is not merely about a historical time period, but about how people's actions, (both good and bad), shed either light or darkness in this world.<br /><br />The acting is magnificent by every cast member.  I was especially impressed with Octavia Spencer's portrayal of Minnie.  Her sass and, ultimately, her kind heart shine through.  Ms. Spencer truly portrayed the character as I envisioned her.  Bryce Dallas Howard was mesmerizing as Hilly Holbrook, the character who is the personification of evil.  Beautiful outwardly, Hilly is a true menace who, with a whispered word of malicious intent, can doom a person to live a life of loneliness and pain.  Ms. Howard is truly talented.  The other cast members were unsurpassed.<br /><br />Please watch this movie and meet some truly courageous and strong characters.  Often, the greatest fights against evil are the ones that are fought by a select few.  God bless you all.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie of Temple Grandin and Claire Danes is great playing   her. I admire what she has done with her life and this movie is well done  and does a great job of portraying her life.
B00076OMW4|5.0|For a recording from the 50's, this remastering as an SACD is an auditory experience that may astound the listener. The dynamic range and presence rivals SACDs that I have from present day recordings with the technologies available to create a digital representation from the sound board to the final consumer product. This is a superb recording, and I don't know of any extant peer.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|I have not viewed this season 2 yet but have watched part of the show on tv. I plan on watching the show from the beginning with season 1, thanks, Linda
B005460302|1.0|I purchased this Blue Ray edition hoping it has a better transfer. Not at all.  The movie lacks any special features and the transfer is VERY BAD.  Even a video cassette would look better as the images are grainy and colors fade.  I don't know why movie studios care to release such a BAD product hoping to take advantage of fans who wanted a better looking product. You don't need it, better buy it on DVD and there will be NO difference among both versions.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Don't even think about watching this like it's a realistic movie. It's a comedy. It is funny. I get the bad reviews for the digital copy screw up but there are plenty who rated it bad because it has bad language and it's not realistic. When are movies really ever realistic, especially comedies? You're going to tell me the Hangover was realistic? Get over yourselves...   This movie is a movie you can just sit back and enjoy. It's pretty random, and has unexpected surprises such as Ron White. This movie will have you laughing your butt off.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Awesome! This review should be what you want to write and not what Amazon wants me to write so I hopw this is enought words for you amazon!
B004HO6I2O|2.0|This video sucked. I really wanted to believe that this wasn't just another dumb lame switch up movie. But... it was a big letdown. Not the worst movie you'll see but it's so cliche and in line with all of the other terrible change up movies. I am a huge fan of Bateman and Reynolds but this didn't deliver. It had a few funny moments but not really much worth owning. If anything, just rent this or Netflix it. I'd say it's good for one watch then you'll be glad you didn't buy it.
0385344325|1.0|I do not recommend this book. I have read several Jack Reacher books by Lee Child and reviewed three or four for this site. For the most part, his other novels were far more believable and exciting. This is the worst Child novel that I have read. Perhaps someone who has not previously read any Jack Reacher books might find his quirky habits entertaining. Reacher fans know that he likes burgers and fries with pie for dessert, all washed down with coffee. A lot of time is expended describing restaurants, waitresses, and tips. I'm not saying that these are not worthy topics; I am saying enough is enough. Reacher would rather buy new clothes than visit a laundry. He gets into street fights against four or more big and incredibly stupid slobs. The slobs are always quickly wiped out, suffering a variety of fractured bones. And there's that \\"clock in his head\\" that tells him the time.  In this book, Reacher is on active duty as an army MP major. So, it's set way back before the other Reacher books I have read, which have him out of the army drifting from adventure to adventure. Here we find a series of murders near a Mississippi army post. The big question: was a captain on the post, the son of a powerful Senator, the murderer, or was it the passionate, beautiful local sheriff?  I finished the book not because I sought the answer; I just feel obliged to finish books that I plan to review. I have occasionally abandoned works that were just not worth it, but I did manage to wade through all of this one.  As usual in a Reacher yarn there's plenty of tedious, unnecessary detail. This irritating trait becomes a major obstacle in this work.  Other than a brief exciting episode in which Reacher almost gets hammered and a few hearty chuckles, there just isn't anything here. Unless you're into really weird stuff involving a freight train...
B0041KKYH4|1.0|This movie is awful and I hate that I spent money to see it in theaters. I was advertised that Jason Segul would be in it, in which he was. He couldn't have been in this for more than ten minutes. He was pretty funny every time because of his demeanor but... this entire thing revolved around Cameron Diaz and she's just not funny period. Then she realizes her flaws out of nowhere without any convincingness. The jokes were pretty awful and I don't mind low brow jokes but this was terrible. This movie was by far my least favorite movie of the year.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|My 29 year old son recommended this book knowing that I like to read hard science fiction. I also play World of Warcraft and have been involved with the personal computer industry since there has been one. He hit the nail on the head telling me to read this book as I read in in two days. Kind of reminds me of \\"Childhoods End\\" for some reason although the plot is not at all the same. If you are a geek of any age (high school and up) this book should be a good read for you. Glad I bought it. Looking forward to more books by this author.
B005UKJX4E|3.0|My simplistic review-interpretation of the film Tree of Life:<br /><br />It's a non-narrative artsy collection of memory slices that critique the masculinized childhood of one man growing up in a 1950s patriarchal family with serious Oedipal issues. This terminally pathetic goo gets sandwiched in some breathtaking cosmic woo a la all great wide angle panoramic experimental cinema that seeks to capture the mystery and wonder of all things. The reviews on Amazon were divided between 1-star and 5-star (brilliant or terrible), & now I can see why.<br /><br />I didn't mind the cosmic woo but was depressed by the patriarchal e[...] And my own spiritual awakenings have been more cinematic. Or to quote my sweetie: 'That's two hours we'll never get back.'
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time. I highly recommend the entire trilogy.  The characters are well developed, the plot is intriguing to say the least, and the writing is very well thought out.  Definitely a page turner. I couldn't put the book down, spent the entire weekend finishing the series.
B000001Y2U|5.0|The starting point where he gets lots of airplay with a huge hit the beautiful people.<br />kids love'em , parents hate'em that's rock n roll folks and that's how its done.<br />5 stars for this masterpeace so many great tracks for a metal head to enjoy.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Just installed this cooler into my system with a QX6700 (stock speeds). This cooler is SUPER quiet and does a great job at keeping the CPU nice and cool. The included hardware is very versatile and it even comes with mounting hardware for a 2nd fan should you choose to install one. A nice added touch is that it comes with a \\"bolt tightener\\" that allows you to tighten down the included nuts to proper specs. At only $25 this cooler is an extremely good value for any enthusiast looking to lower CPU temps and lower noise. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This was classic Jack Reacher in many ways; classic because it gives some clues into his back story, classic because it has lots of action and some unexpected twists, classic because it was fun to read and held my attention, and classic because no one will mistake it for fine literature. Want some good escapist reading? Here you go. Even if you were slightly disappointed in some other recent Reacher, this is a good one.
B005IY3CMQ|2.0|I'm an active member of a Radiohead fan forum and I can tell you from my experience that no fans, aside from the avid collectors, are taking this release as a serious, official Radiohead release. What you see is what you get: takes on TKOL songs from a variety of people who deal in remixes. From my knowledge, the band had little to no input as to what the remix projects resulted in; basically they got some people to tinker with the songs and this is their result. That being said, these remixes really aren't very good. Most of them ended up sounded very little like their source material, which is a shame, because I could see songs like Little By Little and Magpie getting some sort of groovy club remix which would be pretty awesome. Unfortunately, these are at about the same level as the HTTT remixes which were equally aimless and indulgent. My advice-- listen to these on Radiohead's you tube channel, and if you're crazy enough to still want to spend money on them, buy this. Otherwise, quit your complaining and go listen to Staircase. (now there's a track I hope they release soon)
B0001VV1GK|2.0|I got this for my boys when they were age 1 and 3.  It is a lovely and well built toy but, was hardly used. It was just not that fun to park cars in a wooden parking garage.  Just my observation.
0062011847|5.0|Another great book.  I found it interesting that most of the negative reviews dealt with factors that had no connection to the actual story -  kindle version bad, hardback version unacceptable.    Well, I have both the hardback and the audible copies and they are very good.  I have copies of all the audio books and find that it adds another level of enjoyment to the whole experience.  I joined audible in 2004 just to start getting his books and it has been worth it.    This book continues to take a closer look at another aspect of Discworld that is unfolding thru the years. I really like the fact that details are being fleshed out.  Feel he got back on track w/this one - didn't particularly like the previous book - Unseen Academicals. It seemed forced while this one is back with a better and more natural flow.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|It does not contain a digital copy, you must enter a code and download the copy.  This is false advertisement, period.  I have limited bandwidth to begin with, and now they want me to take 8 hours to download a copy for my portable use, as well as possibly have some folks get cap fees for data downloads.  Plainly state digital download, not digital copy as others I have purchased include the digital copy on a seperate disc...easy as pie and copied to hard drive in 3 minutes or less.    Overall the movie was okay, other reviews basically state it all.  I saw it in 3D at the theater and again, it was okay.
630587493X|5.0|I have two children with Asperger's Syndrome, one of whom is well into the autism spectrum.  We LOVED this movie.  Andrew, especially in the beginning, demonstrates many peculiarities that mirror AS very well, from his inability to understand humor to his sense of isolation in a world he felt dearly that he belonged to.  We laughed much louder than we had expected, and our hearts broke over the way he was treated and discarded emotionally -- it hit so close to home that I was nearly in tears at times.  I watched this movie when it first came out, before my children were born, and I enjoyed it then.  Now, from my current perspective, it's become more important and poignant than I could have ever imagined back then.
B005MP28B2|4.0|What a film means to you kind of depends on where you are in life.  I think if saw this film 20 years ago, I probably would have hated it.  Now, I'm faced with big decisions - whether to start a family, and all the concerns that come with it.  This movie raises issues I'd rather not think about.  I almost wish I hadn't seen it.  If you're looking for escapist Hollywood fare, the film might seem boring.  It plays like a movie where nothing happens.  The first third of the film, the director puts you into the head of a mother who has lost a child.  Yeah, it's pretty heavy.  And most of the rest of the film is of the kids growing up.  The film is a meditation, more heavy on emotion than story.  And it's more of a spiritual/religious film than a traditional drama.  There is little dialogue in the movie.  The imagery is compelling, though.  Some of the imagery is surreal and dreamlike - and yeah, dinosaurs make an appearance in the film.  But it's not Jurassic Park.  I wrote down a quote from the film:  \\"The only way to be happy is to love.  Unless you love, your life will flash by.\\"  I wouldn't have given a second thought to that if I were a 20-year-old.  But I'm older now, and this suddenly means something to me.  It's definitely not an upbeat feel-good movie.  And to be honest, I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends and family, even though I couldn't stop watching it.
B002TQ3OBU|5.0|If you like Porcupine Tree, then this is a must add for your collection. Very different and the second and third cycle, it gets better.
B003Y5H5JM|5.0|As my title states, I am not a William Shakespeare fan, sorry but I'm not. Is what it is... However I enjoyed this \\"version\\" of what is (controversially) considered his last play. There are some character changes such as Prospero being female in this version.<br /><br />Look, I will admit that I had the subtitles on -why? Though I do that with movies I've viewed over and over, the reason is I could not catch all the nuances without reading along with the characters. The language is 17th century English as it was thought to have been written in 1610 or 1611 -so it is hard to follow for those of us who are used to the bastardized English we speak today. I will also admit I was lost on a few things that were spoken just because I am not used to the expressiveness of the language used in the play and this film.<br /><br />Visually it's stunning -extremely well filmed -the special effects do not hinder the movie as you really do not notice them as effects but as part of the story and plot.<br /><br />If you love Shakespeare or literature in general you will enjoy this re-visioned version of his play.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Excellent case, very nice protection definitely worth buying it. Little bulky when comparing to bumper case but protection wise very good.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I bought this DVD based on all the reviews saying it was an intense workout.  Plus I really like Jillian and thought she would be hard core.  I consider myself to be moderately fit, but I'm no fitness freak.  I work out 3-4 times a week at the gym and walk the dog most days.  I wanted a hard workout, so I decided to skip right to level three without looking at anything else.  I just popped in the DVD and went for it.  I kept waiting and waiting for the \\"real\\" workout to begin.  Sadly, it never did.  If you have ever been to a cardio class at the gym, level three was easier than that.  If you do regular cardio, strength training and body building, this video may not be challenging enough for you.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|The movie arrived very soon after I ordered it and was in great shape. My son has enjoyed this movie very much. Thank you.
B005IS56CG|4.0|Five finger death punch have found a formula on the last two albums which they continue through this album. If you are a fan of the first two albums, then this album will not disappoint you. Full of metal riffs, catchy courses and riffs, this is testosterone fueled metal at it's best. My purpose of this review is to focus on the different packages. There is the Standard 11 track version, a deluxe version with bonus CD of 4 songs, I-tunes version, and Best Buy Version. The deluxe version has 4 remix's of songs on the album that are Ok, but nothing really worth spending the money on unless you can get it discounted like I did. They basically overdub some canned electronic sounds and beats that really do nothing to make the package special.  The I-Tunes version is the same 4 tracks plus an actual new song \\"the tragic truth\\", which has been available as a preview on many websites, and is a decent track. The I tunes also has the video download of Over and Under It. The price of this is much less than the going price of the deluxe version, and if you are not a big completist like me and don't need the physical disc, this may be the better version for you to go for if you just want the music.  Finally the Best Buy version has a shirt with it. The extra cost for that package there is virtually the same if you got it vs. the \\"free shirt\\" that is included in the deluxe edition. However, you may save just a smidge with best buy because of the shipping and handling (just under ten dollars for in U.S. shipping).  Not really a free t-shirt.  If I had to do it again, I'd probably just get the regular CD and call it a day. Likely they will come out with another version later on like they did with Way of the Fist two times now.  Overall I hope this is helpful for folks out there.
014241493X|5.0|Paper Towns, by John Green, is the story about two dynamic characters: Quentin Jacobsen and his childhood friend, Margo Roth Spiegelman. This young adult fiction takes place at a Florida High School and during the last few weeks of Margo and Quentin's senior year. Margo is known around the school as an adventurous, intelligent, and a highly admired person. Quentin admires her from afar for most of his life. One night she appears at his room asking him to go on night ride to do crazy exploits, and he can't help but feel free from his mundane life and happy to be a part of her life. But the next morning, Margo disappears off the face of Florida. She left him a string of clues to find out where she is, how he can find her, and possibly search for what he's looking for and how to live life to the fullest.   John Green is an amazing young adult writer. He graduated from Kenyon College with a double major in English and Religious Studies. He has worked for the Booklist Magazine, The New York Times Books Review, WBEZ's All Things Considered, and KnogMeg Magazine. He was won two Printz awards, an Edgar award, and the Corine Literature prize. He has also been featured as a finalist for the Los Angeles Times book prize, number five in the New York Times Bestsellers List, one of the top ten in ALA's 2005 Best Book for Young Adults, and is currently number 1 on Amazon and Barnes and Noble's bestseller lists (with 150,000 pre orders ordered and counting). His new book, The Fault in Our Stars, will be out on January 10, 2012 (Youtube blog: Vlogbrothers and johngreenbooks.com).   The way this book was written was clever, witty, and with an intriguing plot that can be easily relatable, from adolescents to adults who are still looking at the world, wondering who they truly are and how they can live in a strange, yet fascinating, society. We, as a society, usually conform to the idea that being pretty or being intelligent determines how successful our lives will be. In the book, according to the main character, choosing your friends based on those ideas \\"always seemed so ridiculous to me, that people would want to be around someone because they're pretty. It's like picking your breakfast cereals based on color instead of taste\\" (Quentin Jacobsen, p. 25). Instead, we should really look our outside appearances to see that we all have that Margo-esque character inside of us. In the book, when Quentin finally realizes that Margo is not the person he thinks she is. He realizes that, \\"The fundamental mistake I had always made- and that she had, in fairness, always left me to make - was this: Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing. She was a girl\\" (Quentin Jacobsen p. 199).The author uses modern dialogue and language to portray each character in order to create a casual, but realistic, tone in the story. I couldn't get over how much I loved the characters and how their dialogue seemed not too far off from reality. Green's characterization is brilliant by adding and highlighting the distinguishing features that make us human, such as Quentin being a social outcast and his sense of loneliness that a lot of teenagers can relate to. How Green creates his story plot is even more amazing when every single event that happens would always lead to another without stopping, each with their moments of suspense, quirkiness, and complete contemplation. The detailed passages in every section were very intricate and have a flowing theme throughout the whole story, which is self-discovery. I also love how Green's writing is almost like a poem that could be published just by itself.   John Green has done it again. Paper Towns is a book that I cannot stop picking up and reading over again. This book has so many connections that many young adults can relate to and how we are all constantly searching for ourselves. Although we've lived where we are today, we always know that everything is just paper and soon we will moveon to find solid ground. To quote from the book,   \\"From here, you can't see the rust or the cracked paint or whatever, but you can tell what the place really is. You can see how fake it all is. It's not even hard enough to be made out of plastic. It's a paper town. I mean, look at it, Q: look at all those culs-de-sac, those streets that turn in on themselves, all the houses that were built to fall apart. All those paper people living in their paper houses, burning the future to stay warm. All the paper kids drinking beer some bum bought for them at the paper convenience store. Everyone demented with the mania of owning things. All the things paper-thin and paper-frail. And all the people, too. I've lived here for eighteen years and I have never once in my life come across anyone who cares about anything that matters\\" (Margo p. 57-58).  If you have not heard of John Green, I recommend you to read his books by picking Paper Towns as your first. It's smart, funny, and reveals the true human nature through the eyes of a character with dynamic features. I guarantee you will read this book two times a day.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Okay, I know comparing this to \\"The Hangover\\" is dangerous since that movie is so loved by soooooo many of us but this movie has the same characteristics: irreverence, over the top sexual humor, a pissed off Jason Bateman (what is with him?) and a plot that doesn't really keep you guessing -you're too damn busy laughing!<br /><br />Yes the movie is funny -I mean these guys are idiots but believable to some degree at being \\"real guys\\". I mean you have a nymphomaniac Jennifer Aniston (admit it guys, we all dream it), a Kevin Spacey character that is an over the top jerk (I'm keeping this review family friendly, fyi) and a coked out freak in Colin Farrell. What's not to love? Jamie Foxx adds his typical spice to his character, wish he had more screen time, though -the one downside, my opinion.<br /><br />Look, if you're over 18 and you want to laugh your a** off, get this movie! I don't want to give away what happens or anything but get the \\"Totally Inappropriate Edition\\" -it's worth it! You will laugh, you won't cry but you will look at your boss in a whole new way on Monday.
B004XWLN20|3.0|Release a Blu Ray complete Set and i will get it and give it 5 stars.   No Blu Ray... not worth it.
B00005JKG7|4.0|This isn't great art, but it's a pretty effective scary movie.  It's one of those movies that leaves enough to the imagination that you think it was moderately scary . . . until the next time you have to drive somewhere on a foggy night, and you find yourself watching for glowing red eyes.  There are a few instances of Stupid Victim Syndrome--why does Jamie Lee Curtis insist on staying in the coroner's room with the boat body?--but it's not as bad as many horror films, and it does a great job with suspense.  It has a back-story that mostly makes sense, and the haunting is pretty consistent, so you don't spend the whole movie laughing about what doesn't really follow.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|My son enjoyed this movie very much and was very happy it arrived so soon after I ordered it for him. Thank you

B003L77GHE|5.0|This show is by far one the best show I've ever seen! Each season gets better, and it is so well written you have no idea what new story lines are going to come in or where existing ones are going. Don't let the title of the show fool you, this show is really amazing! (and I'm not in high school)
0792833201|2.0|I clearly should have seen this when it was new and I was young enough to be scared by it.  I guess it was a major accomplishment at the time, but it had serious flaws from the outset and hasn't aged well.  If it had been a good movie otherwise the primitive special effects wouldn't matter, but, now that the effects look so cheesy it doesn't have a screenwriting, acting, or storyline leg to stand on.  The acting is mediocre at best.  A grab-bag of random, over-the-top, phenomena stand in for an actual storyline.  The characters and their reactions don't make sense: Who stays in a house with a child-eating vortex in the bedroom closet, whether or not it has supposedly been cleansed by a spirit medium?  Furthermore, once the phenomena resume, who stays another leisurely week or so while they pack up to move??  I was starting to think they should just let the thing have that blonde kid, since she was turning out to be such a liability.  Also, if you're particular about your hauntings, this isn't about poltergeists.  It's almost more of a demon thing, except not really.    I watched this and \\"The Fog\\" (1980) in the same evening.  \\"The Fog\\" was a lot better.  This one was much more funny than scary.

0060512806|1.0|This book was recommended to me during a time in which I was suffering from a lack of reading material.  I tend to read sci-fi novels, but thought I would branch out into more reality-based fiction.<br /><br />This novel is a flop for several reasons.<br /><br />1.  This book is much longer than it should be.  I don't mean it's a little long-winded, I mean this book meanders out to San Francisco to get from New York City to Boston.  To illustrate this point, I will direct you to the 5-page section that painstakingly details one of the character's habits of keeping his milk cold so he can enjoy his Cap'n Crunch cereal.  Similarly, you can read the 10-page email one of the characters drafted to the other characters describing how he ventured into the jungle to take a look at some gold bars. If someone sent you an email that was 10 pages long, would you actually read it? These events are not particularly germane to the plot, they are simply long-winded self-indulgences by the author.  Around page 400, I realized that there was very little point to these tangents and it just became tiresome to continue reading them.  Others may describe Stephenson's \\"perfect set-up of metaphors,\\" \\"witty satire,\\" and \\"poetic writing style,\\" but this is tripe.  Stephenson's digressions are neither necessary, nor enjoyable to read. These anecdotes often become so digressive that they read more like stream of consciousness writing exercises than plot-driven asides. Stephenson insults his readers by occupying entire chapters with these digressions and then capping the chapter with a short, 4-line paragraph that moves the plot along incrementally or hints at some connection to the other plot lines.  To visualize this, imagine you have a brother and that brother just won the lottery. He has called you on the phone to tell you.  Instead of leading the conversation towards the subject of his winning the lottery, he instead decides to talk about his new chicken soup recipe for an hour.  As the conversation concludes, and you're getting ready to hang up the phone, your brother says, \\"Oh yeah, I won the lottery today.\\"  THAT is what Stephenson does over and over again in this novel.  This is a truly frustrating writing device and it reeks of the author's hubris.  I would be willing to wager that at least 400 pages of this book is nothing but Stephenson's mental masturbation turned text.<br /><br />2.  The climactic conclusion is anything but and is one of the most lazy wrap-ups I've ever read.  Throughout the first third of this novel I was engrossed with the WWII side of the story, the characters were interesting, the stories seemed to be moving along towards some mysterious intersection, etc.  However, around the 1/3 point this novel comes to a standstill.  The characters meander around pursuing obscure goals, telling somewhat interesting anecdotes, but not really doing anything to keep the reader interested.  I persevered through this chunk of the book, thinking there was going to be some grand tie-in where my hard work would be rewarded.  The tie-in is extremely disappointing; it is not thought-provoking in the least, nor did it produce any kind of \\"Ah, I see where he was going this whole time,\\" moment.  Stephenson knits his stories together across timelines, but it comes together so predictably and clumsily that I was quite disappointed I had wasted my time reading that far.  Stephenson does not pause for reflection on the happenings of the novel; the conclusion is merely a bland sequence of events that can be taken completely at face value, unrewarding to say the least.<br /><br />3.  After setting up the characters, they all become flat and unappealing when they begin to interact.  Stephenson takes so much trouble to introduce his characters, their personalities, and their back-story through the first 300 pages of the book, and then does absolutely nothing interesting with the them as a group for the next 600 pages.  In the introductory portions of thenovel, Stephenson does a great job of telling individual stories, i.e. character A did X, Y, and Z; however, he falls flat on his face when his characters start to have complex interactions beyond an introductory nature.  At no point in reading this novel did I care about any of the characters' group efforts succeeding, they might as well have been trying to build a soap-box derby car for all I cared about their ventures.  The characters interact in such a stiff manner, particularly those involved with the modern-day plot line, that I found myself hoping less and less time would be devoted to these group enterprises.  I was particularly struck by how mechanical and lame the interactions between male and female characters were throughout this novel.  The dialogue b/w characters of the opposite sex was so stilted, and the progression of the \\"romances\\" in this book so obtuse and dull, that it made me cringe to read.  I'm not asking for Danielle Steele-style romance here, nor do I really care if romances develop at all; but if you're going to bother introducing a romance as a plot device, then at least make it believable.  If I were to base my opinion of Stephenson's ability to pen a believable human relationship, romantic or otherwise, on this novel alone, I would have to say that he does not know what he's doing.  The obtuse way in which the characters relate to each other causes the relationships in this novel to come across as grossly under-developed.  I understand that this novel is all about secrets and, as such, the characters are expected to act guardedly.  However, I got the feeling that Stephenson attempted to hide his one-dimensional relationships behind this veneer of secrecy and it just didn't work for me at all.<br /><br />Lastly, I found Stephenson's reflection on the power of money in the modern world, and his blurry vision of what money could be in the future, to be superficial at best.  There was so much room for further exploration of this theme, butStephenson instead decided to spend time with his oh-so-witty satirical asides.  This novel is packed to the gills w/ the author's arrogance and self-indulgence.  Check yourself Neal, you don't need to put everything that pops into your brain down on the paper.
B005529BDK|4.0|Not a ton of depth to it, but there's enough there to kill a couple minutes at a time every now and then. The art's kind of ugly, which is my biggest problem.  It's fun, so whatever!

B0031ES8P6|5.0|Received quick reply from seller that item is coming soon. The TY plush came just like pictured, so cute and adorable, but with a tiny bit lint on its bottom. Packaging needs improvement. Just came with a sheet of tissue paper in the box. Box is cute. And the delivery took so WAY too long after estimate shipping date was pushed up about two days. Anyway, a good purchase. Thanks! :)
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I am ahead of the curve this year.  Due to the repeated usage and viewing from the little one, this is yet another replacement for an awesome movie.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I would challenge those who want to casually rent this for a Friday night movie take a moment and check out the director of this film, Terrence Malick.   If you go to the product page of any other Terrence Malick film, and you'll see the same pattern growing here: people love it or they hate it. It's either five stars or it's one.   Or take two minutes and look at the trailer. If that doesn't pull you in, chances are you won't like the film. I showed it to some friends, and they immediately pointed out that it looked too \\"artsy\\" and decided not to watch it.   And to those saying they are amazed Brad Pitt would be in this: the man has done many, many films...probably as many artistic ones as summer blockbusters. Check out Babel, or The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. And keep in mind he wasn't tricked or dragged into this either: he a producer on Tree of Life, and I can't say the same about Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  I guess in addition to reviewing the reviews, I should actually mention my opinion about the film.   I loved it. The music, the cinematography, the actors...the whole experience. The only thing I had an issue with was Sean Penn, who apparently had a lot of his scenes left on the cutting room floor, and he himself admits that he's not sure what he's doing in the theatrical release version.   Do yourself a favor, though, and take a moment to look at the reviews/trailer/director. You'll be happier for it.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|there have been times where i am out of the office on the road and needed to scan something and send it in to the secretary and this app made that possible! thank you! at one point I actually broke my phone and my mom gave me her old droid so I would end up installing this app alot because I would delete it thinking I would save space on the old droid that didnt have as much memory but I learned that this app is more important than I thought with me being out and about so much
B00092ZL80|5.0|Chicago/Earth Wind & Fire - Live at the Greek Theatre]  Have watched this DVD 4 times.  Saw concert live at Berkeley, far away from the stage.  This concert is like being there, only better.  I recommend this to Chicago and EWF fans.  Hope they come back to the Bay Area soon.
B000FC1HQY|3.0|This book started out great, but it definitely lost steam, and the author became an unreliable narrator. Her perspective of the civil wars in Rhodesia seemed heavily biased (and racist) as well as confusing, but this was a memoir and not a history book. She made her parents out to be totally unfit parents and heavily flawed individuals on the whole, but if her accounts were accurate, she really lived a story worth telling. The way she tells it is quite beautiful as well, but for a book as short as this, it should have read much faster. I got a little sick of some of her whiny BS about her mother, but that was probably the biggest commercial draw to the book based on her NPR interview, so I can't blame her for really dishing that up (especially since her mother really did lose three of her five children to mostly avoidable circumstances). Surely that would mess anyone up, and the surviving children would bear the brunt of that suffering with drunk, morose parents living an effed-up joyride of a life in the African bush.

B000NA28I4|2.0|Ok, when I was reading books years ago, I found time to read Eragon and it I loved it to pieces in the same way with the Harry Potter series. I even read the books that followed after that, Eldest and Brisingr. My problem with this movie is, in terms of adapting a succesfull book, its just lazy. It barely takes time to fully flesh out the story like the book did after the opening. We barely get to know the characters that exist here.  The story follows into Alagaesia as its called, about a young man named Eragon who unintentionally finds a blue stone containing a dragon, and soon finds himself in a whirlwind of Dragon Riders, Elves, Dwarves(at least elves and dwarves were suppose to be in the movie), and an army consisting of the major elements ready to oppose an evil king.  I won't lie. I did like the cast selected to be in this, but despite that: I still hated this movie. Its a real shame that Christopher Paolini sold out his work like this for it to become a movie, and for this to become an hour-and-a-half long disaster. The acting wasn't terrible at all. The bad dialogue was the major issue and the movie was playing away like it didnt care about the story. In terms of directing, the movie certainly does not lack for visual flair, but the another problem is the movie felt incomplete. The reason its getting an extra star from me is my thanx does go to the cast who attempted to bring this life, but this movie is a prime example of how Hollywood has so much money to sometimes take something like the book Eragon, break it, and just give us something they think we wanna see.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I'm only reviewing the 3D aspect of this movie.  It's absolutely gorgeous and totally worth the price.  The 3D is just amazing and so vivid and lush.  You won't regret it.  Zazu is the most entertaining part of the 3D.  At one point in the beginning of the movie you almost feel as if you can reach out and grab him by his tail and pull him towards you.  And when it rains it's almost as though the rain is coming off the screen at you and that you might get wet.  That's just how real it seems.  I would recommend the 3D version to anyone who hasn't experienced it yet, or would love to buy it but just isn't sure about the quality.

B005PR44XC|5.0|The bit-part characters behind the world's current, and still evolving, financial debacles seem so absurd that you would think this book, 'Boomerang: The Meltdown Tour,' was a novel; a humor piece, not a true story; not really non-fiction.<br /><br />But it's all real. Very.<br /><br />Author, Michael Lewis, visits Iceland, Greece, Ireland, Germany and California. Parts of the world that have suffered badly from the financial collapse that became a reality since 2007.<br /><br />He interviews financial industry analysts, politicians, including a former Irish prime minister. And colorful individuals; world citizens, who've personally suffered financial ruin, like a bankrupted property developer, a retired grandfather whose claim to fame was throwing two rotten eggs at the chairman of an Irish bank.<br /><br />Somehow, Lewis manages to keep up with former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as they ride bikes, dangerously, around the streets and boardwalks in Santa Monica. It's an interesting interview, where Schwarzenegger is honest about the challenges he faced running the most populous state in the U.S.<br /><br />Lewis' interviews are more like conversations with the players, than just questions and answers. And it's not just about the people, Lewis also paints a colorful, or rather grey, picture of the places he visits. In Ireland, \\"It's always either raining or about to rain.\\" And in Iceland, the days are so short, \\"the sun sets with enthusiasm at 3:44 P.M.\\"<br /><br />Appropriately, Lewis finishes his book with a conversation with a California fire fighter who has to make do with cutbacks in pay, fire trucks and personnel. It proves that there have been real consequences to the instant gratification mania that snatched up the hearts and minds of bankers, politicians, property developers and home buyers.<br /><br />'Boomerang: The Meltdown Tour' is a highly entertaining and mind-opening read.
B005RUV714|3.0|I was looking forward to this season premier as the first season was very good albeit too short.  Unfortunately they chose to open the season with a standard cliché plot.  That is, the scared kid running off, refusing to follow directions, hiding and forcing everyone else to risk their life searching for the one person they can't bear to leave behind.  This cliché has been used in nearly every action TV show that has children involved.  Lassie, Flipper, Lost in Space, Battlestar Galactica (the original), to name a few.  There were a lot of different ways they could have taken this show. I was hoping the writers, having had such a long break, would be more original.  Hopefully the rest of the season will be better.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Another awesome season of Chuck down the hatch. I had my worries about what would be seen in season 4, and i am happy to say that any fan of Chuck will not be disappointed. The same-old comedy that existed in the first 3 seasons remain intact, and the fresh continuing new story of Chuck doesnt seem to run out of ideas before running out of episodes(always the worry of new seasons there).   Chuck is back around as our clumsy, lovable hero has gone from unknown computer geek to fresh new spy with the Intersect, and he's got the girl: the beautiful Sarah Walker that waits for him at work everyday. Newcomers who need initiation to the series better remedy that by watching seasons 1-3, cuz this season is not gonna have time to play \\"catch up\\". Season 4 begins pretty much where season 3 had ended. Chuck wants to find his mother and piece together the mystery of her disappearance from his life at a young age. Morgan, Sarah and John agree to help him do exactly while back at the sunny place of Burbank, we find out Chuck's sister and brother-in-law, Ellie and Devon are due for a child. Meanwhile, Chuck really wants to move things up with Sarah and pop the old question, and get the rest of his family back together in time.  After i was finished watching this, i was relieved to hear that Chuck would be up for a 5th and final season, and of course, the worry of what will happen this season is in check. If watching this 4th season of Sarah taking it upon herself to try to save Chuck from a psychopath who wants the intersect for himself, or Chuck and Sarah's adventures alone wasnt enough for you with this season, well wait till season 5 begins. . .
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Real Steel is Rocky...WITH ROBOTS. The only difference is that Rocky is named Atom, and instead of rooting for him, you're rooting for the estranged father-son team who controls him with a joystick. It might be the most clich&eacute; thing since sliced bread, but who cares? It's ridiculously fun to watch, maybe because robot boxing is literally the best sport of all time.<br /><br />For example, there was this one part when this robot fought this other robot. Holy crap. It was awesome. And then the robots were jumping all around, and one of their heads came off this one time, and another time one of them exploded, and there was this sick Japanese one, and this really badass undefeated one named Zeus. Whoa.<br /><br />Zeus serves as the main villain sort of. He's Rocky's Apollo Creed, but you know that he's even more hardcore because Zeus is higher up in the chain of command than Apollo. Since Zeus is just a robot, he can't really be a villain though. The actual bad guy is probably this hardcore Asian dude who programmed Zeus to be INVINCIBLE!! Asian guy looks super badass and is always glaring and snarling and he has the best lines in the movie, like \\"He has been programmed for every possible contingency!\\" and \\"The outcome of any match is inevitable!\\"<br /><br />One of the best parts of this movie is Atom's storyline. In Rocky, it makes sense to see him training and improving, and you can really root for him. Here, the writers need to go out of their way to make the tug-at-your-heartstrings Atom a likable character, and one of the main ways they do it is by giving him a \\"shadow function,\\" meaning that when you flip a switch he turns into a mimic, copying exactly what you do. That way, instead of training looking like a scene from Hackers, with Hugh Jackman inputting a ton of lines of code into a computer, you get to see Jackman literally teach the robot boxing moves.<br /><br />Atom's got a cute face and these big blue eyes, so he seems almost alive. In fact, pretty early on, the movie hints at him being sentient. The fact that he has a shadow function and can constantly learn from his surroundings lends credence to this theory, and maybe that's why this amazing bot was found discarded in a junkyard...because he was becoming dangerously self-aware! I was excited for that plotline, but it was just a big mislead. In fact, it was so big of a mislead that I don't think it was supposed to be there at all and I just read really heavily into things for no reason. I wonder if anyone else felt the same way.<br /><br />Atom's a sparring bot, which means he was built for other bots to practice on and he can take a lot of hits, but that's pretty much all we know about him. When he gets knocked down, he gets back up, cause, you know, it wouldn't be good sparring practice if he just stayed on the ground. It's actually surprisingly emotional to see this robot constantly struggle to his feet, but when you think about, without the whole sentience thing, it's not particularly impressive. Ooh, his wiring didn't short circuit. Ahh, he's not out of energy. Wow, he's still got all his limbs.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Max keeps talking about how Atom can do things no bot has ever done before, and that's why he's so amazing, but the movie makes very sure not to ever mention or show any of these so-called \\"things.\\" Walking out of that theater, I was totally unaware of how in the world Atom had succeeded at anything. It's not like he had heart, or drive, or even any particular skill. I think there was probably some witchcraft involved in a deleted scene. Eye of newt, tongue of shrike, make this robot Rocky-like.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I've made this clear yet, but this movie is AWESOME. I absolutely loved it. The complete absurdity of it all was fun and never once got on my nerves, and the robot battles were almost sweeter than in Transformers. The kid was actually a good actor, and the movie was surprisingly emotional. Oh, and Evangeline Lily of Lost fame managed to land an another acting role, so that makes me relatively happy.

B005WGBQ9G|4.0|Pretty good start for season 2. The plot progress is kind of slow though, lots of sluggish moments in this episode and a few random showers of drama out of no-where.  WARNING: this episode has a HUGE cliff hanger at the end so you might as well wait till the second episode comes out next week and watch them back to back. Had I known the cliffhanger was going to be this big I would have waited next week. Now it's going to be on my mind till next monday.

B00000DG1R|5.0|The greatest hits collection of Duran Duran contains many of their memorable musical tracks from the 1980's and the 1990's.  One of the great features of this compilation is that you get a decent number of songs for this collection (19 of them).  I also like how they start this collection with &quot;Is There Something I Should Know&quot;, and end It with &quot;Come Undone&quot;.  My favorite songs in this collection are &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, and &quot;Come Undone&quot;.  This collection is best for many who enjoy any of the songs by &quot;Duran Duran&quot;.

B004LWZW42|5.0|Actually, I didn't get the blu-ray, I got the DVD and it played just fine.  This movie looked really tacky when I first saw the cover and I still had a bad taste in my mouth after watching \\"Wolverine,\\" so I was leery at first. It is very long, by most movie standards, and I kept wondering when it would end. Not so much from a \\"Oh please make it stop\\" kinda way; I was hoping it WOULDN'T stop. It's a good thing it did, though, considering any longer might have worn out its welcome.  It does look tacky at times, but that's mostly because the costumes all SUCK. Especially the blue dude, who just looks like a guy in a monkey suit, which he probably is.  Other than that the acting was good, the story was well-done and all-in-all it was a good movie to sit through.

B005GPFDQK|5.0|\\"All You Need Is Now\\" is a strong collection of musical tracks that epitomize the variance of real human emotions\\".  For example, \\"All You Need Is Now\\" is a great song about enjoying the present moment.  \\"Safe\\" is about taking chances with a person of interest.  I admit that \\"Safe\\" is one of my favorite songs on this cd.  However, the diverse range of music on this cd will most likely have something for everyone that listens to this compilation.  \\"All You Need Is Now\\" is going to be enjoyable to many who desire to hear  the latest music from \\"Duran Duran\\".
1932100660|5.0|I read this book after reading Dr. Esselstyn's book (after seeing him on CNN), and wow what a revelation.  My husband has had high cholesterol all his life, and lost his father to a second heart attack.  My husband always at \\"healthfully\\" and was very active and never overweight in his entire life but he could not lower his cholesterol even with medication--it was always over 250.  I don't want to lose him!  We both read The China Study together and he went totally plant-based, whole foods, oil free and less than two months later his cholesterol (still medicated) is in the 180's!  It's never been below 200 before.  His blood pressure has gone down too.  He is so relieved and looking forward to seeing even better numbers the next reading.<br /><br />I am so thrilled, and have been moving towards this way of eating myself now, though more slowly.  I don't have high blood pressure or cholesterol and I'm not (never have been) overweight, but I do have a strong family history of cancer--that is motivation enough for me.  I have children and I want to be there for them.  Anyone who thinks this is \\"too hard\\" or \\"impractical\\" -- give it a try!  And read the book!  It's not just the China Study it's so much more than that.  We are a very active family and we are making it work.  Our kids are young and are not totally on \\"the plan\\" with us but they are eating a LOT less animal protein.  And man, I will never buy cow's milk again--not ever.<br /><br />I am sick and disgusted by the way the dairy and meat industries (and drug companies) have manipulated me--and the public and my children--and I am so appreciative of Dr. Campbell and all his colleagues!  The sad thing is I can't talk to anyone about this--they all think that my husband and I are crazy.  They say they admire my \\"will power\\"--I wish they knew--it's not will power, it's the will to live, and to live well.
B00000J2PH|4.0|After going years without a copy, purchasing \\"Tapestry\\" really does help solidify a library of classic rock, and establish one's perspective with past music writers and today's hits. Long time staples like \\"It's too late\\", \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\", and \\"Feel Like A Natural Woman\\" link the past with the present as many of these songs are re-recorded to soundtracks and video clips. Tapestry established Carole King's excellence as an individual music writer and performer, and brings life to the days of old.
0307454541|4.0|I bought this book several months ago--knowing nothing about the plot--other than it had rave reviews.  One thing people told me over and over was that it was a hard book to get into and get past the first 30 or so pages--that put me off from starting it.  Last week, I picked it up and wasn't too interested in the beginning, but once I got past it, I couldn't put the book down.  There were some parts that I felt dragged on a little too much, and I found myself skimming.  I was more interested in the Hedeby storyline than the Millennium Story.  I was especially intrigued by Lisbeth's character--and was disappointed that he didn't expand on that in this book--but I'm hoping (and assuming) that we'll find out more about her in the next two books(I will be cracking open The Girl Who Played With Fire tonight!)<br /><br />I usually find myself disappointed by books that get a lot of hype--but that didn't happen here.

B005F6NA56|1.0|I fell in love with Feist when I heard her do a live bit on KCRW back in 2005.  I happened to be traveling through Canada and even got to buy Let It Die before its US release.  Those were the days.  I even went on to hunt down and acquire pretty much every recording where she sang a background vocal, as well as every audio and video clip I could find online.    Then came the Reminder tour, bringing troubles to our relationship.  I showed up wanting to hear music and instead found myself at something more closely resembling a three-ring circus, replete with tap dancing children and synchronized cell-phone waving crowd participation numbers.  Things continued to decline when I listened to the CD from \\"Look What the Light Did Now\\" - a shambling, monotonous mess that made some of her best songs sound boring.  It seemed to me Feist was losing her way, lapsing into self-indulgence and musical apathy.  I have listened to Metals a few times, and I'm afraid it's the end for me and Feist.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I have just been disappointed for too long and developed a bad attitude about her.  I wanted to like Metals, but while listening to it, I keep wondering why it even exists.  It seems interminably boring - nothing resembling a melody, tune or even a groove, just the meandering sounds of sameness with pretty Feist vocals as decoration.  I wouldn't even ascribe enough mood to it for it to qualify as decent background music.  As nice as her voice is, it cannot carry this drab, pointless material.  I am completely baffled by the nearly universal positive 4 and 5 star ratings this thing is getting.    Anyway, so long Feist.  Maybe I'll see you around.
B000JSI7BM|5.0|One of Meryl Streeps finest performances.  Anne Hathaway was perfect.  Emily Blunt made this movie even better.  I have nothing negative to say about this movie.  I was enthralled from the moment I pushed play to the rolling of the final credits.  EXCELLENT!

This book taught me everything I needed to know about drawing critters! I still use these techniques today! I recommend ALL of the Ed Emberley books, they are simply fantastic!
B000I186FW|5.0|This movie is a great metaphor for what is happening is America right now, corporations and wallstreet are the British Fascist state and the rest of us(99%) are the Vs. There needs to be a revolution in America, where the 99% stand up against these power hungry millionaires. Laws need to be rewritten in a way that a small minority can't own most of the wealth, as they do now in America. Capitalism needs to be controlled; the free market has run a mock. Government need to step in and work for the people instead of the billionaires.<br /><br />This was a beautiful movie; Natalie Portman was great. I cried at the last 10mins., It was very emotional and proud to see all the people wearing Vs mask and march toward the armies with guns.<br /><br />5 Stars, hands down !
B005DZMODI|4.0|This sort of project is bound to raise questions... Isn't Taj Mahal a real partner for Marsalis' stellar trad jazz band instead of Clapton? At this CD Mahal is just a special guest on few tunes...<br />However, I had great fun with this CD and DVD combo, probably PRECISELY because this is so ecclectic, conservative and good-spirited neo-new orleans bluesy record.<br />By the way, the question of inadequate blues content for an album titled \\"Play the Blues\\" is actually misplaced: at the time most of these songs were first performed the title blues was liberally given to all sorts of songs that were NOT actual blues, probably because the blues, at that time, had a fine commercial appeal.<br />So, the title of the album reflects the stylistic orientation of the entire project.<br /><br />If you dislike dixieland and new orleans jazz, stay away from this CD. If you want a Eric Clapton album, stay away. If you're a jazz purist, stay away.<br />Otherwise, you might give it a chance - it might very well entertain you if you look at it as a contemporary surging of jump-blues and Louis Armstrong all-stars.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This was by far best of the three films and I liked every last one of them. Anyone who has something bad to say about it, is overly critical and takes themselves too seriously. It has a great story line, a perfect pace, excellent special effects, unexpected twists, tragedies and above par acting. I'd watch the entire trilogy from start to finish without regret.
0345529057|5.0|this is a wonderfull series for adults looking for fun, fantasy and a smart read!!! the character development is magnificent and the heroes and heroines are not without their own faults and vulnerabilities. very human indeed.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Wonderful....a classic!! My kids enjoy the movie and love to watch it again, & again. The transaction was completed with ease and I received the blue ray promptly.
0061714402|4.0|Dave Mustaine's memoires are a pretty enjoyable reading.   For me, it seems quite early for a young man that has just entered his fifties to write a book like this (his band, Megadeth, is at its best, delivering very good albuns, one after another), but I see his point: after a life of excesses, he's trying to get even with his past, in a constructive way. And it includes marriages, management, bandmates and, most of all, Metallica - for whom he nourished (and overcame) sour feelings for almost 25 years.  It's hard not to be sympathetic with a man who exposes himself like Mustaine does in his book. It's touching and bold and a reading I would recomend to anayone who is interested in the complexity of human soul.
0307463745|3.0|This is a must-read if you are getting started, or starting to grow. I found it a little on the light side, finishing it in a sitting, as every second page is an illustration. This is not necessarily a bad thing - you're sure to get through it even if you're extremely busy.  The small, digestible morsels of wisdom are clear, and the format is such that it will work well for quick reference or review later. Just don't expect this to be a comprehensive treatise.  All in all, I am extremely grateful to the authors for sharing their knowledge and experience, and would recommend this book to any that are looking for an accessible list of rules-of-thumb for reworking their business.
0783240287|5.0|This movie has gotten me through some tough times health wise.  Whenever I feel down I put this on.  Donnie Osmond half naked?  YEP, and looks good I might say.  Donnie and all the actors did a wonderful job of putting the story across.  A few cheesy scenes with the brothers but will expose you to many different types of music.  The children's chorus were great also.  I recommend this to everyone!!    I thought I knew the story from reading the bible, that was too long ago, but this brought back things that I had forgotten that were important to the whole story of Joseph.  Thank you Donnie, and all the cast members, you've given me an enjoyable look at an important bible lesson making it funny at times, poignant at others.  You all did an exceptional job.   Let's watch it again!!!!  Too bad can't give it more than 5 stars, it makes me smile.  If you knew my health problems you'd realize how rare that is.  Someday would love to see on stage but health won't allow for that so push that bluray back in there one more time, pharoah man.
1439192812|5.0|It isn't a pure children's science book, rather it's sort of an illustrated children/adolescent version of Sagan's \\"Demon Haunted World\\" organized around scientific topics.<br /><br />Each chapter starts with a question any inquisitive child will inevitably encounter, ie \\"Chapter 5: Why do we have Night and Day, Winter and Summer?\\" Dawkins then spends a few pages reviewing cultural/religious/mythical explanations that people relied on in pre-scientific times (whether from the classic polytheistic religions, the modern monotheistic religions, or from the many other religions which still exist today in various parts of the world).<br /><br />Dawkins then typically goes for 10-20 pages explaining all of the fascinating science that contributes to our modern understanding of the topic, followed by a few pages recapping how and why our scientific answer is better than mythical answers from the start of the chapter. This is repeated for a dozen questions, with varying amounts of confrontation against the 'traditional answer' depending on the chapter. He doesn't mock the religious answers (as he often does in his other works), rather he just poses each set of answers as \\"here's what people used to think before they knew much, and here's what informed people now know to be true.\\"<br /><br />Unlike the organization of a typical science book, the topics in Magic of Reality are split up according to their pertinence to classic questions posed by every civilization in history (How did we get here? How did it all begin? Why do bad things happen? Why do different languages/races exist? etc).<br /><br />Dawkins' geneticist background really shines through in the evolution chapter - it's one of the best explanations for children/young adolescents I've come across so far. In my opinion it provides some of the clearest, easiest to understand introductions I've seen across a range of key science topics, and does so while promoting an inquisitive, skeptical mental framework to encourage more learning.  It's probably ideal for kids in the 8-15 range, depending on their aptitude for science. I'm 25 and have spent most of my life in the sciences, and I still found the book fascinating, the illustrations beautiful, and the writing flawless.r kids in the 8-15 range, depending on their aptitude for science.

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Commenting on the first post...well, looks like enough people have already done that, what an idiot.  This is checkers, nothing special, exactly what I expected from AI, they make decent board games (even though I'm pretty sure the backgammon is rigged, that has nothing to do with this review.  I'm not sure if anyone else already commented on this, I'm not going to read through 80 reviews, but one person said something about the computer cheating because it wasn't jumping pieces it could jump.  To the person who wrote that review, there are many different ways to play checkers, the most basic of rules though does not include the ability to force a jump.  It would be fun though if AI offered all the different types of checker options...just a suggestion.  There are at least 6 ways I remember learning how to play as a kid.

1580086810|5.0|As a pre-service teacher, I was introduced to this book by a mentor on teaching rounds. She used the photos of the families in the book as a slideshow to compare what foods the families eat in a week. The students found it highly engaging and as I flipped through the book so many lessons were coming to mind. This is a fantastic resource for any teacher of Health, Economics, Geography or Food Technology. This book not only has fantastic photos, but statistics on each country, a complete break down of spend of money on food, a family recipe for each, focus point essays on important issues, as well as a complete lifestyle profile for each family. It is such a useful book for teachers and I highly recommend you get a copy!

B003L77GH4|5.0|***SPOILERS AHEAD***  When TVD started back in '09 I thought well....another vampire-romance frigging Bella Swan rip-off??? Yes...I'd think that...heck! Everyone would've thought that with all the vampire craze that's going on...  But from...I don't know, 5th season 1 episode I was officially hooked...TVD has proved to me that a show CAN exploit the vampire romance craze out there but provide many awesome tv moments too...  This season started out strong, picking up exactly from the season 1 finale \\"Founder's Day\\"...with \\"The Return\\"...  All that talk and foreshadowing of Katherine and finally she made her return felt with turning Caroline?!?!?!?! to a frigging vampire which was needless to say plain awesome...I loved Candice Accola's character and she proved an awesome character even as a vamp...  Watching Nina Dobrev playing two characters was plain fun and I have to give major kudos to the beautiful actress as this was not an easy task and has without any objections pulled this off! Elena and Katherine are two completely different characters and this was one of the best -if not THE best- things of the season...  Now adding the Original vampire family to the mix spiced things up with the second half of the season focusing on how to save Elena from the infamous Klaus all climaxing to the frigging excellent \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"...  The show has awesome storylines and EVERY episode is a big episode as the back cover is, spot-on, stating...  Now I wont talk too much...just hear me out here and you wont be dissapointed, when I say THIS. IS. AN. EXCELLENT. SHOW.  Favorite episodes include: \\"The Return\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", \\"Memory Lane\\", \\"Kill or Be Killed\\", \\"Plan B\\", \\"Masquerade\\", \\"Katerina\\", \\"Daddy Issues\\", \\"The House Guest\\", \\"The Last Dance\\", \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and the season finale with an awesome cliffhanger, \\"As I Lay Dying\\"  Preety much the half season ending up in the favorites list isnt bad, huh?

B005I64U5C|5.0|I've seen all the Super hero movies as of late, and this movie is stronger than most of them across the board.  I haven't enjoyed a super hero movie like this since rhe first Ironman movie. This movie develops the charscters so much better than films like Twighlight for example....  You have a reason to care about the people in this movie.  It's an origin story begging for a sequal. This is a great kids movie as well.  -JD
B001F6TXME|5.0|About all I can say about this remote release is that it was reasonably priced for something from Nikon.  For most purposes I prefer a cordless shutter release, but at this price point, I thought I would buy this one, mainly for shooting panoramas which require multiple shots without camera shake, and for that, this works fine.  The cordless solution I have for my D200 and D300 is even more convenient.
B000VHPXR2|1.0|Warning, warning Will Robinson!  These are not the original recordings of Jesus Christ Superstar that were released on Decca records in 1970.  All are, what I would call, cheesy remakes.  As others have said, the production and quality is lacking on this version.  The lyrics might be the same, but the original powerful music production, arrangements and singing are sadly lacking.

0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is perhaps the best book I've read in a very long time; it is certainly the most imaginative. The plot is deceptively simple. Two aging magicians train young proteges to compete against one another at the circus. But this is no ordinary magic. These are no ordinary students. And this is definitely no ordinary circus. I was entranced from the first line and remained so throughout. I've never read a book quite like it. It had a dreamlike quality to it that caught me up in it's tendrils and wove it's tale around me. The circus itself was dark and bizarre while remaining beautiful and inviting. The characters were intricately made, much like the clocks in the story. I loved the author's use of second person in various passages throughout the book. \\"You\\" are at the circus. \\"You\\" smell the aromas and visit the magical tents with their extraordinary performers. \\"You\\" are there. I highly recommend that you get your ticket and experience the circus that \\"arrives without warning.\\"
B00466HN86|5.0|Every Father should see this movie if you have children or plan on having in the future. Be prepared to cry. I am a father of two a 4 year old and a 7 year old. I am also a Police Officer and have been one for about 14 years. This movie will touch your heart and your soul. The movie is not all about being a Police Officer but just being a good father and a Christian. The movie is 2 hours and 10 minutes but seemed more like 45 minutes because it was so good. I HIGHLY recommend to all fathers. So,,, grab a box of tissue and dont be afraid to let your tears fall,, it only means you have a heart and a convitcion.

B005U9RQNU|5.0|I watched all 4 seasons in their entirety.  First 3 on Neflix instant view then I started hunting around to see if I could watch season 4 somewhere and I found it right here on Amazon!  Right under my nose!  I could not stop watching and had to see it through to the end.  A good definition of a genius production is when you find yourself rooting for the bad guys.  In fact, they were all bad guys.  The ending of season 4 was very satisfying indeed.  If there were no season 5, that would be alright with me.  I would just assume that the story ended there and our two characters along with their families went back to living normal lives.  HOWEVER, if there IS a season 5 . . . I WILL be watching!  :)

0307279189|5.0|I finished this book yesterday. I started it two weeks ago and couldn't put it down this past weekend so I pounded through the last half of the book. I found it very entertaining and gripping. Some reviews have said the author tends to exaggerate. I agree with that, but the stories are still fantastic. I'm also motivated to try natural running. I'm not claiming its a cure all (you get hints of that in the book), but I've been running in the \\"traditional\\" method in \\"traditional\\" shoes for years and I ALWAYS get injured! After 8 miles or so my knee feels like its ready to explode. I'm willing to try anything to be able to run and not pay for it with joint pain. The author's logic makes sense (that contrary to popular belief, our feet are made for running), and besides, if it works, I save a lot of money not buying expensive running shoes every 6 months!

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I decided to post a review after seeing the low ratings given by other customers. Let me begin by saying I am a very casual Kinect gamer who originally purchased it to play sports and fitness games. I have a decent space but a monster sectional couch that impacts the space I have to move laterally, even after pushing the furniture back. As a result, the Kinect was gathering dust, something I would play once a month at best.  I saw the Nyko Zoom reviewed on GTTV and subsequently picked it up. Simply put, it worked for me. With the new peripheral I don't have to move any furniture to end up in the \\"best\\" position. I haven't had any issues with not recognizing body or hand gestures. The only adjustment I made was to place the Kinect on top of the box it was originally packed in so the Kinect could \\"see\\" over the media console all the way to the floor. I even played it during the daytime and had to pull the shades down so the Kinect could operate.   In a nutshell this simple add on performs as advertised. If you have ok space, and don't want to move furniture every time in order to play a quick game or get a workout in, this is it. Not sure why others have had issues with the Zoom, but I haven't encountered any problems yet...

0143119788|5.0|I first read \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" during one of my summer breaks from college, and found it one of the most engrossing, superbly-written books I'd ever encountered. I proceeded to read the second and third books of the so-called \\"Karla Trilogy\\" (\\"The Honourable Schoolboy\\" and \\"Smiley's People\\") and have counted myself a Le Carre devotee ever since.<br /><br />When \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" was brought out again in cinematic version this past September, I decided to re-read the book before watching the film. And its star has not dimmed. It is quite simply one of the finest espionage books ever created: not just in its intricate plotting and portrayal of spy tradecraft, but in its pulsating suspense, evocative settings, and nuanced insights into the grays and murks of individual ethics---especially when they collide with those of the state. The character of George Smiley, as well as all his associates and adversaries in British intelligence, remains as vibrant and real today, two decades after the Cold War ended, as they did in the 1970s.<br /><br />\\"Tinker, Tailor\\" was just as enjoyable and worthwhile the second time through. It is still a masterpiece---not just of the Cold War, but for all time.

B003L77G6A|5.0|DVD was great, enjoyed seeing one of our favorite Sitcoms again.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.  Received our DVD in a short amount of time and in great condition.
0545123291|4.0|I went into this thinking it would be slow-paced and dragging like the first book, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. Maggie did a great job writing this book and I found myself very interested and eager to see what would happen between Grace and Sam.<br /><br />I think I enjoyed this book more than the first because there were more things going on. You got to see Sam and Grace together. Their relationship is so cute and so new, yet strong and intimate, you can't help but hope they stay together forever. I also really loved the secondary characters like Isabelle and Cole. They're both pretty snarky, stubborn, and messed up in their own ways, definitely interesting characters.<br /><br />Throughout the book Sam battles with the fact that he won't ever become a wolf again, while dealing with the new wolf in town, Cole. Cole isn't your typical nice guy, he's pretty messed up, and a rock star to boot! But his role in this book is crucial and he did add some lightness and humor to a rather serious book. I loved the interactions between him and Isabelle. Grace has to deal with her growing health and familial issues and then they all come to a grave realization about the fates of the wolves, each other, and themselves.<br /><br />The ending was pretty awesome and I'm so ready to jump right into Forever, the 3rd and final book, I can't wait! I wasn't giving this series high hopes after reading the first book, but after this one, I might have to go back and read the first to see if I can get a new perspective on it. Definitely a good book to read.

B0052TDGQO|2.0|American Idol 10 champ Scotty McCreery impressed millions of viewers with his incredibly mature baritone vocals for such a young fella. That southern, good-ole-country-boy charm certainly didn't hurt his chances - it only propelled him more making McCreery a frontrunner on from day one.  Unfortunately on his incredibly rushed debut (October seems way too soon) [[ASIN:B0052TDGQO Clear As Day]], too many times the singer falls victim to the pitfalls of many first Idol-produced albums.  The material is only mediocre at best at times, and Scotty never sounds a capable and impressive as he could and often did on the show.  Overall, the objective music enthusiast and fan feels that perhaps a few more months, a few better songs, and more time evolve as an artist would have helped Scotty produce a more well rounded, and maybe most importantly a more `memorable' effort.  That said, what is to take away from the history Mr. McCreery has made at all of 18 - a #1 debut album, the first male to debut at #1 at such a young age, and the first Idol to have his/her debut album debut at #1 since 2003 when Ruben bowed at the penthouse.<br /><br />Clear as Day opens averagely with \\"Out of Summertime\\" which is smartly uptempo and features typical countrified production with banjos, pedal steel, and acoustic guitars.  Scotty sounds solid, but the material does him little justice; the songwriting is too repetitive at times and could have been shorted by nearly a minute.  Winning single \\"I Love You This Big\\" may be filled with schmaltz, but it saves the day.  The songwriting is lofty, particularly for an 18-year old kid, but  McCreery pulls it off convincingly.  The production is light and well-conceived, notably the use of organ in a tasteful manner.  The biggest surprise? Ester Dean (songwriter/R&B artist) is credited as penning a country song. Title track \\"Clear As Day\\" follows, but rather than building off the momentum of \\"I Love You This Big\\" falls short.  McCreery's vocals are too understated on the verses and overpowered too quickly on the chorus - a build up of intensity would have better shaped the performance.  The chorus is the best portion of the title track but even so, it feels second rate at best.  That opens the constant argument that is presented on Clear As Day - is it Scotty's youthfulness or the mediocrity of the material that hinders the effort?<br /><br />\\"The Trouble With Girls\\" is a notch less enjoyable than \\"I Love You This Big,\\" but ultimately proves to be one of the efforts better cuts.  The biggest complaint is that \\"The Trouble With Girls\\" follows two slower cuts and so at this point, one is looking for the tempo to accelerate.  Additionally, how much does an 18-year old really know about girls ultimately? Regardless, the refrain is catchy enough and certainly atones for the mediocrity of the disappointing title cut. \\"Water Tower Town\\" gives the listener the faster tempo, but also brings an added clumsiness to the delivery. McCreery does not sound comfortable enough to pull this cut off and even given the up-tempo sound, there is a like of inauthenticity here. Country artists have performed cuts like this many times, however Scotty does not quite have the experience, confidence, or truly exceptional songwriting to pull this one off. Generic, as harsh as that sounds.<br /><br />\\"Walk In The Country\\" helps to get McCreery back up off the ground again keeping the tempo accelerated.  Keith Urban's songwriting credit may be he tipping point of this cut.  The brief length is perfect for Scotty and while it is still not an overt `hit,' it shows the promise of the singer on his next album.  \\"Better Than That\\" `siphons' out the marginal momentum established by \\"Walk,\\" but thankfully the excellent \\"Write My Number on Your Hand\\" shows Scotty's potential as an `artist,' not just a product of American Idol.  But \\"Write My Number on Your Hand\\" would prove to be TOO good for this effort and is followed by \\"Dirty Dishes,\\" a ballad that slows down the tempo and amps up the southern references.  The refrain is pure schmaltz but McCreery barrels right on through it.  Not as good as the best ballads, one issue is McCreery vocally is covered at times by the lush production.<br /><br />\\"You Make That Look Good\\" features Rhett Atkins as a co-songwriter, yet still the cut is a bore despite its tempo and reference to trucks, a popular topic of country music.  \\"Back On The Ground\\" is another cut much like \\"Dirty Dishes,\\" however McCreery does sell his voice well here.  Closing cut \\"That Old King James\\" references faith and appeals to the Bible belt.  It have great intentions, but is only average at best.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0052TDGQO Clear As Day]] is mediocre or average at best.  Scotty does have a nice voice, but even that can't make this effort a truly cohesive or star-studded affair.  Hopefully on his future releases McCreery is allowed the proper time and adequate material to help him develop into a true artist aside from American Idol.  That said, still a fan of the voice.ps up the southern references.  The refrain is pure schmaltz but McCreery barrels right on through it.

B000003R7G|5.0|what can i say? its portishead, baby! its the greatest band of the last 20 years, and this album is amazing.
B004WE01YA|4.0|Just like with [[ASIN:B004WDRT1Y The Lion King (Four-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]] the Beauty and the Beast was great in 3D.  Disney has really done a good job with the 2D to 3D conversion of their films so far.  The 3D effects are all very good and do not detract from the original content in any negative ways.  Things \\"pop\\" at the right time and the foreground/background 3D effects never overwhelm you.  Another great job by Disney.  If you own a 3DTV the Disney 3D movies are some of the best I've seen so far.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|This is an enjoyable film.  It has aged quite well too.  It is made more special to us as we have been lucky enough to have met three members of the cast!  Sean Astin, Joe Pantoliano and Robert Davi.  Great spills and thrills from Richard Donner, who was clearly on a roll.  Good family fun, which these days, is a premium.
0307938905|3.0|Jim Dale is magical as always!  The story plot is very different and unique.  It's unusual and sweet.  The only thing I wished is that the author would have spent a little more time developing the characters.  This book would have been great as a two part series.  I still liked it, I just think I would have liked it better if I felt more connected to the characters.  Still a good read.
B000OONTFU|5.0|We bought this, what seems like a looooooong time ago now.  We were so excited because it THE MATRIX...in our hands....in (gulp) High Definition!  And we were not disappointed by the PQ either.  You can see the details very clearly indeed, from the scars on Laurence Fishbourne's face to the threads and weave of Agent Smith's suit.  This was our very first MAJOR HD purchase, back in the days when there were two HD formats...remember that?  Three excellent transfers for one excellent movie and two sequels (which, admitedly, do improve with a few repeated viewing...or am I just getting used to them?) and a monster, silly - one might even say \\"bordering on excessive\\" - amount of extras.  Of which my only main gripe is that the ANIMATRIX feature is in standard definition only in this set.  Other than that...a great set to have!
B005GVA2L0|2.0|5 stars?! Do you guys REALLY think this album is worthy of 5 stars?!?!?! Or am I seeing double here? While this isn't exactly a band album at all, I'm quite shocked that this albumis getting so many 5 star comments here. Do you guys really think this album is as good as Fallen? Sure this album is in sme ways better than The Open Door, but no way is it worthy of 5 stars!<br /><br />That said, I like the songs \\"The Other Side\\" and he single \\"What You Want\\", but that's about it. Almost all the songs sound exactly the same and Amy's voice is buried beneath the horrible production. I thought it was just my speakers crapping out on me early (it is that loud), but then I listened to it on another CD player, and it was just as bad sounding.<br /><br />There's almost no memorable riffs or hooks on here, and while The Open Door had a few catchy riffs, this has almost nine. All the songs have the same generic radio rock sound. Amy sounds amazing as usual, no news there. Also, the drum mix is too low, thus resulting in me not being able to remember a single drum lick on this album.<br /><br />I've listened to it 3 times, but honestly, I'm not sure if I want to listen again. It's that bland.
030788743X|3.0|I never read \\"Twilight,\\" from what I have heard from other readers and the film itself, it is poorly developed story that panders to teenage girls for an easy fix. This is how I feel about \\"Ready Player One\\"; however, instead of teenage girls it for those 80s fanboys who obsess with the era's pop culture.  The story has minimum character development, the least feasible situations, an horde of villains that are as more threatening as a Stormtrooper's aim. There are so many deus-ex-machina moments that the main characters must be gods themselves. This panders to any fanboy's basic fantasies in a World of Warcraft setting. So what... I am sorry I was such a \\"Twilight\\" hater. Okay, maybe not. But I understand. I have talked to several intelligent women, women I respect and honor their opinions, and they say cannot help but love the tripe that is \\"Twilight\\". Okay, I understand. I just hope that you understand why I dig \\"Ready Player One.\\" So if you are a geek. Read it. It is nothing good, but I think you will like the light read. If you are not a geek, fanboy, video-game player, D&D lover, or anyone that know the meaning of 42, stay away.
B004OR1XGK|2.0|I bought this book in papaerback and I thougt it was OK, not great but I have been slinging software for forty years mostly on mainframes so very little is totally new, I then got a kindle version and I am really dispointed since the charts and graphs are pretty much useless and cost of the Kindle version is high compared to other books (I have 290+ kindle books).  I cannot recommend it.
1594481717|4.0|Perhaps I read this book with a whole new mind but I took away lots of new and somewhat random information from this book: The combination of automation, abundanc, and Asia has been a death-knoll for American industry. We must change the way we prepare children for the future to teach the new important qualities including play, story, empathy, symphony, and design. Most effective leaders are funny. IQ accounts for less than ten percent of career success. Other important facts are imagination, joyfulness, and social dexterity. Design is \\"utility enhanced by significance.\\" The four basics of effective design are contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. Choose things, we are urged now, because they delight you not simply because they are functional. Stories are easier to remember because stories are how we remember. We believe that stories amuse and facts illuminate, but this is not true. Symphony is seeing how everything works together to make a whole.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I didn't feel that this film had sufficient character development. If you're looking for a film version that is true to the book, this would not be one. Overall, it's a pretty gripping story considering that Steven Spielberg was the director. The gothic elements were a unique twist compared to most film versions of the book.
0439023521|4.0|The story is compeling and makes for a page-turner.  This is not a story I've read a dozen times before.  Very fresh and new.  A little graphic in the fighting scenes for some tastes, but if you can read Stephen King and the like, you'll have no problem with this series of books.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great very happy and fast shipping the movies are total mastered with deleted scenes added in plus the three bonus dics make this whole collection worth the price
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This is such a engrossing series, it's hard to find anything that comes close to it.  Everything about it is exceptional.... the writing, acting, sets, characters, plots, photography, etc.<br /><br />In an era that fills so much of television with mindless \\"reality\\" programming, it's refreshing to have a series such as this.<br /><br />From the first episode of season one, I was hooked on Mad Men, and couldn't wait for the next episode.<br /><br />This show is like a good martini.... intoxicating.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Well clearly this Sim's game has gone to far! What type of person makes a game where 2 large happy families have to fight each other to the death over nothing? This isn't ancient Rome, this is America and we don't tolerate these types of blatantly racist murder games!  On the other hand, the checkers game did make for a nice interlude between all the fighting. Shame it lacks two player.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|I will always love Evanescence, but I feel that the older you get, the more.... situated with life you get, and the less strong your feelings get, in some ways.  Without that younger angst and searching for yourself sort of thing, having gotten older and gotten married and found out concretely who she is. . . .I think that makes the music itself less strong and searching.<br /><br />!! Listening to some songs again/ Final thoughts:  The songs sound better the more you listen to them.  I really enjoy it, but the songs don't stick in my head the same way.  More Evanescence is never a bad thing.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My husband and I are absolutely hooked on this series!  We miissed the seasons on TV but were curious about the show, so we ordered the Season One DVD.  We were captivated from the start of the first show.  We have ordered the rest of the DVD's that are available and just started watching Season Three.  This series has a mix of humor, drama and sadness that draws the viewer in.  The characters are very well developed and the story line is believable.  I've read that the network is going to kill the show at Season 5; that would be a real mistake.  I'm hoping that another network picks it up.  I am not ready to let go of Walter and Jesse and their strange, intertwined lives.  We look forward to the time we have to sit and devote our time to this fantastic one-of-a-kind show!

The scripts are delightful blendings of police work AND personal relationships - the acting is perfection, and the chemistry between Castle and Beckett is almost tangible.  GREAT show!

0375834605|5.0|Hello fellow readers, If you want your child to start to enjoy reading and keep there levels soaring. Please get them this book and let them enchant their imaginations, it is nothing like the movie. But, it is agrat way to keep them reading and learning.
B005OUARUO|3.0|I like Feist, from front to back.  This album is a compilation of average songs that often carry one tone and one pace.  Like riding on a horse slowly in a circle for an hour.  It's the kind of album you listen to while you paint your walls gray during a week when it is cold and rainy.   My huge problem is the recording itself.  I know its supposed to have that raw natural sound, but it's often bass heavy mix makes songs sound muddy.  Anti-Pioneer is by far the best song that builds on itself, carried mostly by her vocals and has some range.  Other than that most of the songs carry one tone and have no build up or conclusion.  Like Undiscovered First, its a perfect example of  riding a horse, it sounds like white noise.  I wished they would have had more variation, a bit more passion in this one.  They got stuck in one gear, never moving up or down.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Galaxy S Continuum Fun to play...not easy enough for toddlers but fun for older kids<br />Challenges the brain to think ahead
B005LAZIRY|2.0|A messy throw back to the psychedelic 70s.  It's a well crafted mix of songs that would have been best released as a B-side or as a side project.  My problem is if you are a fan of the genre of music they are trying to emulate, why not just play the originals?  It's an ambitious album that will either have you falling asleep or stomping your feet praising the band for being different.  Different does not always equal good, no matter how you want to spin the technicalities.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Excellent service response and product condition.  A \\"must see\\" for everyone who is connected in any way with persons who have or are caregivers for autism.
0307352145|4.0|This is hardly an impartial review. As somebody who has been called at some point or another the gamut of terms associated with introversion, from \\"shy\\" (which I don't object) to \\"anti-social\\" (which I most certainly consider unfair), I found in Susan Cain's \\"Quiet,\\" the validation and appreciation many introverts have been searching for.<br /><br />In \\"Quiet,\\" Ms. Cain explains the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the 1920s and how it is that today we associate talkative, risk-taking, and action-oriented people with intelligence, beauty, power and success.  The Extrovert Ideal is so pervasive that influences our work performance, educational policies, political choices, and even the country's financial health.  But the focus of \\"Quiet\\" is on exposing the myths and misunderstandings that were born when we as a culture embraced the Extrovert Ideal and turned introversion into a malady to be avoided.<br /><br />To dispel the misconception that introversion is some kind of sickness or \\"weirdness\\", Ms. Cain traces both the biological and cultural basis for introversion and extroversion and their role as evolutionary survival strategies in animals and humans.  She interviews scientists who have conducted hundreds of studies to test different theories in an effort to determine how much of our temperament is a result of genetics and/or of our free will.<br /><br />The best part of \\"Quiet\\" is that the insights gleaned from these studies can help introverts take advantage of their special traits and thrive on their own terms in an extroverted world.  Since introversion and extroversion are preferences for a certain level of outside stimulation, Ms. Cain advises introverts to find their \\"sweet spot\\" --or what scientists call the optimal level of arousal.  Scientists also notice that introverts engage in \\"deliberate practice\\" or working alone so for those looking for a job, Ms. Cain encourages them to pay attention to the layout of working spaces to determine how much interruption they may have to deal with at work.  For those still deciding on a career, the author reminds readers that research shows that introverts are not reward-seeking like extroverts, but rather motivated by the enjoyment they find in pursuing an activity; in other words, by being in what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls the \\"flow\\".  Ms. Cain offers encouragement to introverts to venture in the extrovert world because we all have the ability to stretch our limits but the optimal way for introverts to do it is in the service of their \\"core projects,\\" the things they are passionate about.  And for those with children, the author dedicates an entire chapter for helping introvert children become confident and comfortable in extroverted environments and situations.<br /><br />Amid the research and the advice, Ms. Cain calls the readers' attention to those introverts who have made a difference in the world like Rosa Parks and Ghandi.  They showed that empathy, thoughtfulness, persistence, compassion, focus and conscientiousness, all characteristics ascribed to introversion, are leadership attributes too.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" has not only given me a better understanding of introversion but also of the opposite trait.  The same person, who labeled me as \\"anti-social\\" also boasted on how easily he could befriend people and in the same breath, complained about how my quietness and solitary pursuits would be hell for him. After reading Ms. Cain's book, now I realize why somebody who can make 100 friends would be so bothered by the one solitude-seeking friend in the group and why introverts and extroverts attract each other. And so, I think, introverts and extroverts will both benefit from reading \\"Quiet\\".  But for those of us, innies who find joy in doing our own thing, prefer a book than join a party or think monastic silence is bliss, there is no longer any need to feel guilty or like we are oddballs because of our preferences.  The message from \\"Quiet\\" is clear.  Introversion has never been an aberration but a variant of the norm.version has never been an aberration but a variant of the norm.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This 2 DVD set contain 4 features:  The Concert  A $300 million production that sees Celine performing in this 4000 seater theatre specially built for the show.  Unlike Taking Chances which was staged in a humongous stadium, A New Day Live In Las Vegas is a more intimate show with plenty of performers flying through mid air, dazzling props and sets and Celine shows off some nifty footwork. The breezy 90 minute set shares some similarities with Taking Chances Tour. It has the medley of It's All Coming Back To Me Now/Because You Loved Me/To Love You More and closes with Love Can Move Mountains, River Deep Mountain High and Mt Heart Will Go On. The set list have to keep with the stipulated duration, so only a few songs from her albums A New Day Has Come and One Heart are performed.   As much as the visual aspect is important, it cannot replace Celine's genuine enthusiasm, her zest and the way she touches the audiences with her heartfelt performances. Just look at how many of them cry during her show.   This production will give the other queens of the concert extravaganza namely Cher, Kylie and Madonna a run for the money.  Bonus Feature:   Because You Loved Me A Tribute To The Fans  I really liked this as it interviews fans around the world who fly in to see the show. It details their thoughts before meeting her, their journey to Las Vegas and the touching moments during the meet-and-greet.   Special Feature:  A New Day All Access.  Basically a backstage pass. The sound volume for this feature is somewhat softer. It shows Celine travelling to the venue, doing sound checks, the dancers getting excited etc. During the concert, the feature splits into two screens. One showing Celine onstage and another detailing what actually happens backstage. You see the technical aspects, like how the performers are fitted with harnesses in order to fly. They managed to sneak in some peek-a-boo shots of Celine changing.    Bonus Feature:  A New Day: The Secrets.  The show was taped with Celine with short blonde hair. Unfortunately, they had to throw it out as the fans did not like it. But they saved some footage of her flying through the six storey theatre singing The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face which is not on the concert feature. There are plenty of insights from cast and crew to make this one a must watch as the show is not as easy as it looks.  The Packaging  That's the only beef I have. It's very difficult to remove the discs as you have to slide them carefully out from the holder. Sony could use the conventional type for future pressings.  A New Day is really a great package which explains why it has gone triple diamond in Canada and multi-platinum in many countries.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|The score for this musical is magnificent and will resonate with you long after you have finished listening to the CD, when you find yourself humming the tunes. Whilst this is very different to the Phantom of the Opera - demonstrating a much more mature ALW, it compliments the wonderful original beautifully!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I can not believe someone would give the new blu-ray Star Wars films a 1 star. It is the best I have ever seen it. The effects are amazing. My sister and I never stopped commenting on how great it was. Saying stuff like\\"wow\\" and \\"Its amazing\\". I absolutely love Star Wars and it has come a really long way do people still want to use VHS I know I don't after seeing this. This version is the best ever and I am still in love with Star Wars as much as I was before. George Lucas is a Genius! May the Force Be With You
B005FFW46S|1.0|I purchased the Kindle version, and deeply regretted it. The footnotes are set in a clunky hyperlinked format. Some of the hyperlink formatting (deep brown underlines in my version) carries through to subsequent paragraphs so that full paragraphs are underlined and hyperlinked. The footnotes can only be escaped by using the \\"browser-style\\" back button. There were typographic errors on almost every page. Very disruptive. I finally quite reading the Kindle version, and purchased a hardcover from a brick-and-mortar competitor. Love the story. The Kindle version not only is not ready for prime time, but actively detracts from the reading experience. Actively avoid.  I've purchased lower-priced Kindle e-books that were seamless reads. This, on the other hand, was processed very poorly, and sold at an inflated price. Sir Terry's work deserves better. The story was wonderful, marvelous, and takes one at the tide. The Kindle version? Unforgettably awful.
B005ILWOZA|3.0|With \\"The Awakening\\", James Morrison returnes to the business of bothering the middle-of-the-road with his Rod Stewart-meets-Ben Ottewell tones.  There are countless worse noises in pop - but there's nothing in his voice, fine though it is, that conveys the emotional weight he should perhaps be carrying after such childhood hardship (school-days loneliness, and he nearly died as an infant). It's a television talent show beast, a chimera of sorts, halfway between the soul singers he loved growing up and the grit of an indie frontman. It just exists, peculiarly passionless, when it should grab hold of the listener and demand that they pay it their utmost attention.  But, again, it's not an off-putting sound - and there are moments on \\"The Awakening\\" where its audience does indeed sit up and take notice. One such number is \\"Up\\": remarkable not for Morrison's measured performance, but that of guest vocalist Jessie J. The BBC Sound of 2011 poll-topper has never sounded as good as she does here, delivering a remarkably understated turn that's miles away from the horrible hyperactivity of her own album. Their lines entwine excellently, and there's a warmth to the song rare amongst Artist A featuring Artist B offerings.  \\"Person I Should Have Been\\" shares compositional DNA with Sting's much-covered/sampled \\"Shape of My Heart\\", but Morrison never edges too close to pastiche (which would be easy to do, given the track's skeletal form); and the title-track is the slow-rising centrepiece to this record, where a light acoustic introduction gives way to a far-fuller song almost evocative of Stevie Wonder.  \\"One Life\\", which should be a rallying call to embrace the moment, is oddly stillborn on delivery - but it's a rare blip in consistency.  Yet, as \\"The Awakening\\" unwinds, one can't shift the feeling that we should be touched deeper.  Morrison's surpassed the likes of James Blunt and Paolo Nutini as a British solo artist able to meld modern pop sensibilities with echoes of his own influences without the collision sounding forced.  Compared to those artists, his vocals cut through with a far greater sense of sincerity.  But the abum is lacking the grandstanding moment it needs to elevate it above reserved recommendation - it's a safe, steady affair, but about as revelatory as a Chris de Burgh best-of.  Morrison has a truly great album in him - he's the emotional baggage to craft it, should he let locked-away demons loose - but for the third time in a row, this isn't it. M.Diver
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Like most folks I was sceptical when I sat down with my popcorn, but not for long.  Beginning the film with an actual dance was ingenious, and showing us the tragic accident immediately created the climate for the town of Bomont's overprotective atmosphere.  The director paid just the right amount of homage to the original with the use of the car, the red boots, and the similarity in the dance party attire.  The change in the mother's history in the new movie added to Ren's character arc.  Also, the new choreography, especially Ren's warehouse number, really made it surprising and exciting.  I wasn't the least bit disappointed at the script changes and was, in fact, impressed at how the writers were able to update the dialogue to make it more believable.  Ariel was actually more realistic in this version compared to the original, and I thought her chemistry with her Dad was more intense.  (Spoiler alert!) The only thing I missed was not seeing Ren's friend get busted up quite as bad at the C&W club as he did in the first movie.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|reading the other reviews gave me goose bumps. Just the memory of these tracks in my head.  This album may be slightly different than the others, but it is so good. Most tracks are shorter and to the point. Many seem to fit in to a larger whole. But don't let the \\"concept album\\" label scare you. The lyrics by Gabriel - edited by Banks are memorable - unforgettable. This is a must have. The few instrumentals themselves make this worth owning as Hacket get some room to burn. I think Carpet Crawers (one of the few played) is ok but its only a just a mild taste of the many more spicy and beautiful pieces. Get it out!

0937381888|5.0|A must read for anyone interested in getting started home brewing as well as anyone looking to brush up on the theory and nuts and bolts of all the processes involved in turning some grains into the delicious nectar of life.  Palmer does a good job of organizing the book into separate sections pertaining to each process to be covered in depth while at the same time making the procedures accessible for the newbies just looking to get their feet wet and brew their first couple batches.  It's some technical reading if you sit down and attempt to make your way all the way through it, but I tend to treat it more like a reference. I leave it open within reach while I brew just in case something funky happens and I need his advice!  Enjoy.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|Before I say anything I have to mention that I paid $2.69 for this item and got free shipping with Amazon Prime. Wow! It must have been a glitch because I tried to go back and buy 10 more to give away and now they are over $13 each. I was concerned that my Pentax Optio A40 wouldn't fit. It fit like a glove. The little inner pocket for an xtra sd card is pretty handy. I would prefer a clip like the case I use for my droid phone but the velcro clip works fine...although I get nervous it might fall off, it hasn't happened yet! It would be perfect if it was a horizontal case but all in all I am delighted with it. Since It is just as easy to whip my camera out as my droid phone, I can shoot superior photos and video. Amazon did a fine job with this...and the price at least in my case made it extra sweet!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|It ain't easy pulling off an ancient civ television series without being cheesy. By some lucky chance Starz has managed to make its Spartacus series work on multiple levels just barely missing the cheesy mark. Blood and Sand shocked me. Vicerally violent, highly erotic, and filled with political and social machinations that keep viewers coming back for more it's fast become a favorite in our household. But as Season 1 reached a bloody climax it was hard not to sulk at the misfortune of some of the greatest villains on television. More! We wanted more! That's where Gods of the Arena became an oasis in the desert.<br /><br />If you haven't watched Blood and Sand, please do not watch this first! Yes, this is the story of the rise of the house of Batiatus but I would encourage folks looking to give the series a try to be patient and watch Gods of the Arena after seeing Season 1. Why? As you watch Gods of the Arena a multitude of the little questions that don't matter in the scheme of the overal Spartacus story-arc are answered. Why is Crixus such a die-hard gladiator? How did Ashur get his injury and become the Dominus' errand-boy? When did Lucretia first seduce Crixus? And many more of those nagging little things that aren't key to Spartacus' character development but fans of the series will enjoy getting the lowdown on.<br /><br />I was not a big Crixus fan through-out the first season. He was interesting but I couldn't quite buy his motivations. This prequel season is the season of Crixus and managed to take a relatively one-dimensional character richly compelling. In contrast the previously mentioned but never seen Gannicus introduces a character we will meet in the upcoming Season 2 and gives us enough back story to look forward to seeing him in future episodes. Ah, but it really is the villains who make this show utterly skin-crawling, yet delicious! Seeing a softer Lucretia suffer at the cruel tongue of her father-in-law while she is truly devoted to her husband really sets the tone for the growing tension. Enter the scheming, licentious Gaia, her dearest friend and the start of the raunchy sexual escapades the house of Batiatus becomes known for. Meanwhile, the seeds of the rivalry between Batiatus and Solonius are planted as best friends find themselves at odds.<br /><br />While one might call this series of six episodes filler and it is certainly not required watching to enjoy Spartacus as a series I really think it serves to round out character development that didn't fit into the first season while comforting fans waiting for Season 2. With the passing of the Andy Whitfield, the title star, it's a bit difficult anticipating the next season. If the cast--including the title character's new casting--and crew continue to bring the same intensity, visual brilliance, and delightful dialog it is certain to continue wowing fans and disgusting others with the sex and violence.for the growing tension.

B0032JTV74|4.0|Overall the set has great quality, I don't need to repeat the good evaluations it already has. The one thing I miss is a playlist. Whenever I want to see a single musical or a specific episode, I need to go to Wikipedia and find the episode number that I'm looking for, then play the appropriate disk.
0062011847|2.0|If i've ever faced a challenge with Discworld books in the past, it was to put them down, not to pick them up. Whether it was the humor-focused books in the middle of the series or the more dramatic and plot-driven (but still funny) books that've come out in the past several years, there'd never been a Discworld book that i'd willingly set aside at just about any provocation.<br /><br />Until this one.<br /><br />If Pratchett's name weren't on the cover, i wouldn't have gotten past page 5. The writing is sloppy. The characters are unrecognizable. The plot, well, i'm sure it's in there somewhere. In short, this book just isn't good.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Sir Terry, but i might have to start seeing other authors.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|It might sound like a minor issue, but the lack of a landscape orientation makes very difficult play on a netbook. Great for phones and tablets though!   On the other hand, it has very smooth animations, even on a very slow device, and there are many modes of gameplay.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|I always wonder why people can invest that much on the special effects but so little on the story. The beginning of the plot is okay but once the key villain of this episode appeared things just changed too abruptly. Warning: Spoiler below! How could Megatron be influenced with only a few words by the new main actress and turned against the other Prime? Why were those many Decepticons not around the teleporting switch when the Autobots attacked? In short, pity! p.s. The new girl looks too much like Cameron Diaz to me, and the 3 stars were solely for the perfect CGs.
B005C7SXNW|5.0|This film is captivating.  Funny, imaginative, intelligent and beautifully beautifully filmed - heartbreakingly so at times, making the most of it's South Wales setting in mountains and coast, but one of the most incredible sequences in recent cinema is played out in the empty amusement park.  This is a confident film début by Richard Ayoade.  The story is touching and easy to empathise with.  The tone and style provoking easy reminiscence for anyone who grew up in the UK in the 1980's.  The action itself it skin crawlingly uncomfortable at times, inspired at others but always captivating; it is exceptionally acted, the characters intriguing and fascinating.  Your mind flicks between each of them, trying to understand them and their stories.  The Alex Turner soundtrack is superb and worked seamlessly into a film that is not afraid of the quiet.  Also, the French art film inspired sectioning of the film is achingly cool and adds to intellectual feel.  But this film can still be enjoyed on many levels.  As you can tell I'm somewhat enamoured with this film, it's the first thing to come close to my all time favourite; the Virgin Suicides.  It's a close call and I'd call it a draw for the time being.
B005CM9DX6|3.0|I am a huge Opeth fan.  Every metal album (and even Damnation) is always on my playlist.  They introduced me to a genre that i wasn't a fan of before they showed me it can be done well.  They showed me what \\"good metal\\" is.  Its complex and every single component is integrated perfectly.  The guitars were spot on.  The drums were perfectly crushing.  The vocals were beautiful in both soft and aggressive form.  Each song was a masterpiece by itself.  Opeth is one of my favorite bands, no question, and the list is few.  I appreciate slowing the music down like they did in Damnation.  That is a fantastic album that is a must own; if you don't have it - get it!  But when i listen to this new one, i try to hang in there but find myself switching over to Ghost Reveries, Watershed or one of the good old albums that never disappoints.  They are so good at that style that its hard to listen to them do anything else.  When i pop in Opeth i expect metal of the highest standard, because thats what i've known them to create.  This new album, Hertitage, is musically fantastic, but it is not metal.  No my friends, not even close.  Its complex and different, but compared to their other albums it seems subpar.  When they are so insanely good at metal its hard to say this progrock cd is good.  IMO they should have released it under a different name because we expect something different from Opeth (I do).  Its diluting the good name they worked hard to create.  Don't get me wrong, they are top-notch musicians, but i personally feel that they are a 10+ as a metal band and a 5 or 6 as an artsy progressive rock band.  Its all in preference and you may love this album, and i suggest you borrow it to see what you think.  They make great music, you should just screen this to see if its what you want.  I personally always revert to one of the previous albums that has carved a place for itself in my heart.  Opeth is a metal band.  One of the best metal bands i have ever heard.  They have my respect as professional insanely talented musicians.    Listen to this before you buy it, you will either love it or hate it!

Kevin Hearne appears on the dark urban fantasy scene with a fresh take on our favorite pantheons and a character, Atticus O'Sullivan [tell me that isn't just the coolest name ever], who has interesting skill sets, an Irish Wolfhound with opinions and a lust for sausage, Big Bads with all manner of nasty designs on the hero, a nosy neighbor and an understanding widow who extends an offer when the bodies pile up. Then there's the law firm and a New Age-ish shop and magic that is suprising and logically consistent.<br /><br />I began reading just a few pages to see if I liked it. Guess I did because I didn't pull my nose out of the book until it was finished. And even better ... I didn't have to ask 'is there any more?'

B005CMSDLE|4.0|It's not necessary to suspend disbelief to imagine a government, just about any government, doing nasty things to gain a military advantage over its enemies, and maybe even its friends.  Add some high-biotech, beyond state-of-the-art manipulation of basic reproductive material in a weapons-grade experiment that gets out of hand, and we're still not enirely out of the domain of plausibility.  Write a slam-bang story based on an admittedly far-fetched rendering of the foregoing premise.  Recruit a cast of really fine actors, including those who fill the roles of kids who are, in various winsome ways, precocious but never obnoxious, and you've got a really fun movie.  In this case you've got Hanna.<br /><br />As played by Saoirse Ronan, Hanna is an engaging character who combines almost unlimited resourcefulness, a purposefully focused cloak-and-dagger sort of sophistication, and a very believable naivete' in a world that is exciting, dangerous, and wherein she finds genuine friendship and affection.  While on the run from the off-handedly evil Marissa (Cate Blanchett) and her henchmen, Hanna joins up with a family headed by a couple of well-meaning and likeable latter day hippies.  Their daughter Sophie is about the same early-adolescent age as Hanna, and Sophie's little brother is immediately taken with our pretty and daring protagonist.  The family is determinedly accepting of differences of all kinds, and the parents encourage their children to be independent.  Even they, however, can't help but notice that Hanna is, well, special.<br /><br />The hippie family provides aid and comfort for Hanna when she needs it most, and the cleverly written story, along with remarkably capable actors, avoids annoying stereotypes that often emerge when dealing with '60's throwbacks.  Sophie, Hanna's first real friend, is naturally articulate, self-assured beyond her years, and genuinely funny.  Even Sophie, however, is stunned and frightened when she sees for herself what Hanna does to  survive the onslaught of the nefarious bureaucrat, Marissa, and her hired assassins, be they jack-booted thugs or more than a little effeminate impresarios.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is perhaps a bit too bland, maybe even wooden, as an amoral government official.  Throughout the movie her voice and accent change in ways and for reasons that are not explained.  Erik Bana does a fine job as Hanna's father, as tough as he has to be, but also genuinely loving.  His role, too, could have easily collapsed into a tough-but-tender stereotype, but Bana is a better actor than that, and he's working with a really nice screenplay.<br /><br />The movie does not take itself too seriously, and neither should we.  Hanna is a fun movie, loaded with excitement, none of which seems gratuitous.  Nothing deep or profound here, just a good story, even if it is a bit outlandish, with a lot of action and a really fine cast.  Just relax and enjoy it.  You may or may not think the ending is happy, but it does seem fitting.es to  survive the onslaught of the nefarious bureaucrat, Marissa, and her hired assassins, be they jack-booted thugs or more than a little effeminate impresarios.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is perhaps a bit too bland, maybe even wooden, as an amoral government official.

0060775858|5.0|To be honest I really did not like this book when we received it as a gift for our newborn.  There are black and white pages in between the color ones, rhymes are kind of wooden when spoken aloud, pretty much the same images over and over through out the book-I put it at the bottom of our growing stack of children's books.<br /><br />Fast forward a year.  My little girl picks out books for Dad to read to her and one in particular is grabbed over and over, Good Night Moon. She starts pointing out things that I never really noticed, like the little mouse is in a different place on each color page.  It became a game for us to \\"find the mouse\\".  And she started following and anticipating the basic words patterns.  And when I read to her \\"and a quiet old lady who was whispering.....\\"  and I would pause. And then whisper quietly in her ear \\"...hush....\\"  And soon she started to quietly whisper \\"hush\\" when I would pause.<br /><br />She is now 2 1/2 years old.  She loves being read to every night before bed time and the book she chooses the most is still Good Night Moon.  I now see the genius of the author.  The black and white images are the dreams.  The little old lady rocking in the child's bedroom while knitting until they fall asleep; the last page she is gone-mission accomplished.  The perspective of the color pages changes slightly so there is always something new to find.  It ends with \\"goodnight noises everywhere.\\" which maybe helps ease some of the fears of those unknown noises we heard as children by addressing them and, not only that, kindly telling them to have a good night.<br /><br />We now have a 4 month old little boy and I cannot wait to read this book for years to come.

A wonderful snapshot of a short-lived Bruce era that exists nowhere else.  Highly recommended.

There is some great slide guitar in there, a traditional sound, a contemporary sound, a new feeling with each track. I had not heard, or heard of, Ana until AMAZON started promoting this album, but now I'm a big fan. If you are any sort of Blues tragic, like I am, you will not be wasting your money on this album!
0393327655|1.0|The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason<br />Sam Harris<br />New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2004<br /><br />Review-Commentary by Reverend Brian Van Hove, S.J.<br />Alma, Michigan<br /><br />Published in The Fellowship of Catholic Scholars Quarterly, vol. 28, no. 3 (Fall 2005): 30-32<br />Posted on Ignatius Insight, 15 February 2011<br /><br />Mr. Sam Harris ([...]) wrote a new book about something old. In the long history of philosophy we have encountered his thesis before. His is a naïve enthusiasm for the power of reason and rational verification, which really means that he has rediscovered the 18th century and its Age of Reason. Perhaps as an undergraduate he never read William Barrett's Irrational Man.<br /><br />Does the author appreciate light to the exclusion of heat?--after all, love is famously irrational. But for Sam Harris, love is a pleasurable state of mind (189). He picks the \\"happiness and suffering\\" of sentient beings to ground his rationalist ethics, which he calls \\"realist ethics\\", but \\"happiness and suffering\\" are described materialistically (171). \\"Reason is nothing less than the guardian of love\\" (190). Thanks for contributing to an already loveless world!<br /><br />Harris advocates something akin to a Neo-Enlightenment. His skepticism about any truth outside the mind and reason, narrowly conceived, is used to dismantle the architecture of our historic Western worldview (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim), yet he offers nothing in replacement except Buddhist meditation (288 n. 16) and old-fashioned rationalism updated by neuroscience. \\"How can we encourage other human beings to extend their moral sympathies beyond a narrow locus? How can we learn to be mere human beings, shorn of any more compelling national, ethnic, or religious identity? We can be reasonable\\" (190). The End of Faith is his first book, and it is short--227 pages of text and 62 pages of notes.<br /><br />The End of Faith is a caricature of organized Western religion and faith. He says \\"Our enemy is nothing other than faith itself\\" (131). And again \\"Indeed, we know enough at this moment to say that the God of Abraham is not only unworthy of the immensity of creation; he is unworthy even of man\\" (226). The tone of the book is contemptuous in the extreme. Harris's work rejects the contribution of Western-inspired (= Semitic) world religions to civilization and to our times. For the author, religion is a liability, political and social. His philosophical materialism has drawn him to work on a doctorate in neuroscience. He thinks anything that was good in religion can be found elsewhere. He thinks mystical states and religious impulses are located in the brain, not in a transcendent \\"totaliter aliter.\\" Hence his admiration for Buddhism and other Asian non-dualist systems of consciousness training (215-216; 283 n. 12). Now he is studying belief, disbelief, and uncertainty by way of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging).<br /><br />Harris claims that intuition is a respectable first step for the inquirer en route to realism grounded in scientific truth, and so he rejects the position of relativists and pragmatists and pluralists who can never get to certitude. There is here a relationship with 19th century mechanism, determinism, and the \\"inevitable laws of history\\". He accepts a materialist conception of certitude in the philosophy of science, while explaining that he has spent many years practicing Eastern meditation (283 n. 12).<br /><br />Harris has a practical agenda. He thinks that, unless we coherently apply reason to all human endeavor, including ethics, we will be destroyed. Surely this is noble. Harris is looking out for you and me. He believes that the threat from Islam is of the greatest urgency, and that there is likelihood it will go nuclear. Fellowship readers can assume Harris's opposition to orthodox Jews, Muslims, or Christians. But what comes as a surprise is his withering attack upon the moderatesand the liberals among them--indeed, quite a surprise. This book is implicitly more against the K&uuml;ngs and the Bultmanns (although he seems to write approvingly of Paul Tillich) than it is against the Grand Ayatollah or the pope who are, for him, obviously indefensible.<br /><br />Although he would not like to welcome back the Christians of the 14th century, he thinks their revisionist heirs are the ones who keep propping up the unjustified myths and unprovable assertions of outdated biblical religion. He says \\"We will see that the greatest problem confronting civilization is not merely religious extremism: rather, it is the larger set of cultural and intellectual accommodations we have made to faith itself. Religious moderates are, in large part, responsible for the religious conflict in our world, because their beliefs provide the context in which scriptural literalism and religious violence can never be adequately opposed\\" (45).<br /><br />The End of Faith is studded with the usual examples to illustrate his thesis. The discussion of the Paris Plague of June 1348 A.D. would interest Catholics (70-71), and even more so his portrayal of the Mass (72-73). He likes to refer to the Holy Eucharist as \\"a cracker\\".  The Mass is one of the best examples he can find of a preposterous belief. He quotes, without source or exact reference, \\"The Roman Profession of Faith of the Roman Catholic Church\\" to show what he means (241 n. 30).<br /><br />However, when it comes to the Inquisition and the Holocaust, he admits that he has treated these thorny subjects cursorily, and he refers readers to some literature on these subjects (107)--without giving them any authors who might disagree with him. None of the best historians of the inquisitions are cited (Kamen, Peters, Shannon, Netanyahu), even though they are well published and they may have some pretty sympathetic things to say about the church. For the Holocaust, he relies on Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, for one, but never mentions Rabbi David G. Dalin or Father Richard John Neuhaus. Harris is blissfully innocent of the serious criticism Goldhagen received from Neuhaus in First Things. (See [...]). Harris refers to Pacelli as \\"Pious XII\\" and on the same page (106) he reveals a complete misunderstanding--another caricature--of papal infallibility.<br /><br />Probably Harris considers post-conciliar Catholicism rather tame, yet he opposes it by saying \\"... even the most docile forms of Christianity currently present insuperable obstacles to AIDS prevention and family planning in the developing world, to medical research, and to the development of a rational drug policy--and these contributions to human misery alone constitute some of the most appalling failures of reasonableness in any age.\\" (150; esp. 167-169).<br /><br />The End of Faith is as much about the culture wars as anything else. His attacks upon an alleged irrationality of Mr. Justice Scalia and American anti-marijuana and anti-sodomy laws (156-164) seem unprofessional for an academic and more suited to an angry ACLU activist. Thus, Harris reveals himself as a popularizer who is especially annoyed at restraints on stem cell research (165-167).<br /><br />Harris's philosophical hero is likely Bertrand Russell, who comes in for praise in places (esp. 173). Russell was a peace activist, and a man who accepted spirituality in some sense, but scrupulously subjected it to reason and science. Noam Chomsky gets a beating because he does not see that the real problem in the world is religion. Wittgenstein is dismissed (288-289 n. 19). Harris states plainly that faith is the mother of hatred (30). He can say something good about Rousseau and Schelling (283 n. 11). Generally, though, he is against Greek wisdom or Western philosophy because of its dualism, though he credits Pyrrho with some innovation, probably because he learned something when he traveled to the border of India (282 n. 9).<br /><br />Basically, Harris thinks that science will solve nearly everything in this life, including matters of morality. He trusts the human mind unfailingly, thus implicitly rejecting Kant and his legacy (172). Ethics is located in the physical brain, not in the will or the intellect as classically conceived, by Kantians or by Thomists.<br /><br />He joins a long line of those who have idolized modernity. People used to think this way before the sinking of the Titanic gave them pause, not to mention the pause given more recently after the demise of the Challenger and the Columbia. The Myth of Progress thrives in this book. Just escape from our obscurantist past and its odious survival in the present via faith, and the future will surely be bright.<br /><br />Mr. Harris and my retired cardiologist may have something in common. The End of Faith could have been written only by a very young man. Harris is cocky and not very modest in his claims. He spreads the net of his discourse too widely. He is a trenchant mega-scoffer and a hot-shot currently on the lecture circuit. My retired cardiologist also began his career as an atheist, moved on to spend many years as an agnostic, and recently (like the venerable Anthony Flew) announced he was a Deist as the arguments from intelligent design theory were so compelling. Perhaps at the end of his academic journey Sam Harris's final thought might echo St. Augustine--\\"Too late have I loved Thee.\\"<br /><br />The historical Voltaire received the last sacraments on his deathbed. It was reported that Jean-Paul Sartre was moving in the direction of theism at the time of his death. Harris sympathizes with those who would enjoy the sacred, especially as death approaches (232 n. 20), but for him spirituality must be deeply rational (43) and divested of unreasonable faith-tenets. Spirituality is in the brain, and it is a state of consciousness, not a relationship with the Other--the Thou of Martin Buber. For Harris, that would be mere religion and he says \\"No personal God need be worshipped for us to live in awe at the beauty and immensity of creation\\" (227).<br /><br />For now, Sam Harris is tightly locked in a universe knowable only to the most rigorous 18th and 19th century methodological empiricism united to the newest technology. Unlike Jacques and Raïssa Maritain a century ago, who discovered Henri Bergson to help them out of this philosophical dead-end, the young Mr. Harris has found no similar rescuer. He would minimize the saints whom Bergson revered, while offering no real antidote to despair, a common problem in post-Christian Western scholarship and its nihilist heirs.<br /><br />We await his second book to learn if he has evolved in any worthwhile direction. The End of Faith breaks no new ground, nor does it rework old ground seriously. Neuroscience is fine, but it is not the tool to answer ultimate questions. We may already be frightened by reckless Islamism, but we did not require Mr. Harris's analysis of Islamism to do this for us (203). His proposal for a world government is so tiresome. His particular solution to the deeper problems of the human situation has already been explored (he denies this by saying religion prevents us from exploring anything since religion rejects all new evidence--176) in the first Enlightenment. Perhaps due to his youthfulness, Harris's philosophy is flashy and facile--or lacking in erudition, as when he wrongly ascribes a famed Scholastic adage to Christopher Hitchens (176). He confidently looks to the future of reason when he is recommending its worn past. He would definitely dislike World Youth Day in Cologne 2005, when these lines were written.abbi David G. Dalin or Father Richard John Neuhaus. Harris is blissfully innocent of the serious criticism Goldhagen received from Neuhaus in First Things. (See [...]). Harris refers to Pacelli as \\"Pious XII\\" and on the same page (106) he reveals a complete misunderstanding--another caricature--of papal infallibility.<br /><br />Probably Harris considers post-conciliar Catholicism rather tame, yet he opposes it by saying \\"... even the most docile forms of Christianity currently present insuperable obstacles to AIDS prevention and family planning in the developing world, to medical research, and to the development of a rational drug policy--and these contributions to human misery alone constitute some of the most appalling failures of reasonableness in any age.\\" (150; esp. 167-169).<br /><br />The End of Faith is as much about the culture wars as anything else. His attacks upon an alleged irrationality of Mr. Justice Scalia and American anti-marijuana and anti-sodomy laws (156-164) seem unprofessional for an academic and more suited to an angry ACLU activist. Thus, Harris reveals himself as a popularizer who is especially annoyed at restraints on stem cell research (165-167).<br /><br />Harris's philosophical hero is likely Bertrand Russell, who comes in for praise in places (esp. 173). Russell was a peace activist, and a man who accepted spirituality in some sense, but scrupulously subjected it to reason and science. Noam Chomsky gets a beating because he does not see that the real problem in the world is religion. Wittgenstein is dismissed (288-289 n. 19). Harris states plainly that faith is the mother of hatred (30). He can say something good about Rousseau and Schelling (283 n. 11). Generally, though, he is against Greek wisdom or Western philosophy because of its dualism, though he credits Pyrrho with some innovation, probably because he learned something when he traveled to the border of India (282 n. 9).<br /><br />Basically, Harris thinks that science will solve nearly everything in this life, including matters of morality. He trusts the human mind unfailingly, thus implicitly rejecting Kant and his legacy (172). Ethics is located in the physical brain, not in the will or the intellect as classically conceived, by Kantians or by Thomists.<br /><br />He joins a long line of those who have idolized modernity. People used to think this way before the sinking of the Titanic gave them pause, not to mention the pause given more recently after the demise of the Challenger and the Columbia. The Myth of Progress thrives in this book. Just escape from our obscurantist past and its odious survival in the present via faith, and the future will surely be bright.<br /><br />Mr. Harris and my retired cardiologist may have something in common. The End of Faith could have been written only by a very young man. Harris is cocky and not very modest in his claims. He spreads the net of his discourse too widely. He is a trenchant mega-scoffer and a hot-shot currently on the lecture circuit. My retired cardiologist also began his career as an atheist, moved on to spend many years as an agnostic, and recently (like the venerable Anthony Flew) announced he was a Deist as the arguments from intelligent design theory were so compelling. Perhaps at the end of his academic journey Sam Harris's final thought might echo St. Augustine--\\"Too late have I loved Thee.\\"<br /><br />The historical Voltaire received the last sacraments on his deathbed. It was reported that Jean-Paul Sartre was moving in the direction of theism at the time of his death. Harris sympathizes with those who would enjoy the sacred, especially as death approaches (232 n. 20), but for him spirituality must be deeply rational (43) and divested of unreasonable faith-tenets. Spirituality is in the brain, and it is a state of consciousness, not a relationship with the Other--the Thou of Martin Buber. For Harris, that would be mere religion and he says \\"No personal God need be worshippedfor us to live in awe at the beauty and immensity of creation\\" (227).<br /><br />For now, Sam Harris is tightly locked in a universe knowable only to the most rigorous 18th and 19th century methodological empiricism united to the newest technology.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loads super fast and works great on Droid Bionic and even on my older Droid 2.  Stop down rating if you have a crappy smartphone.  Anyway, whats most important is that the gameplay is hugely entertaining.  The only downside is that the android version doesnt have all of the neat updates the iOS version does.  Hopefully they will come out with it soon
B003AYDPYQ|5.0|I loved every minute of it. I was glued to computer monitor. Good acting and good writing as well as talented special effects behind the scenes. A lot of special effects are so over the top these days, but everything about this show is done just right. I highly recommend BB.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|First of all, this is not so much a game as an interactive novel. This is not to say that it would be better as a book. The format it is in is perfect. No other format could provide as ingenious an experience, and people who've finished the game know what I'm talking about. When people bring up the subject of video games as an art form, 999 is the game I point to as proof of it.  The story and writing in 999 is extremely compelling stuff. If you hate reading, then you should not buy it, but you'll be missing out on an incredible work of art. Of course, if you hate reading, you're already missing out on most things worth experiencing, but I digress. I can't go into much detail without spoiling key plot elements, but trust me and the critics; if you love a good story, 999 is for you.  By the way, the one-star reviews on this site DID NOT FINISH THE GAME or even go through more than once (which is necessary to advance). They do not know what most of the game contains and have made very premature judgments.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|The title says it all. If you are new to Breaking Bad start with season 1, this is a show that has a lot of back-story and history. Exceptional writing and acting, I highly recommend.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This a great movie. I am a African American woman and I see nothing wrong with this movie. It is showing how bad black maids were treated in the 60s. And how unjust the white people were to them. What's wrong with that? Unless you just want to find something wrong with movie that's you; but  for me I enjoyed the movie and hopes that it does good on dvd sales.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This is a review strictly for what is now being classified as including an \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\" instead of a Digital Copy you can copy to iTunes or WMV and watch on an iPad or other portable device.  As with Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern, this USELESS Ultraviolet Digital copy MUST be streamed while using Flixster and requiring you to download ANOTHER movie viewer.  If you have a data plan on an iPad or smartphone, you will reach your capacity simply by viewing this movie.  Why did Warner Bros. make this change after offering an ACTUAL Digital Copy with previous releases?  I for one will be refusing to purchase ANY releases that include an Ultraviolet Digital Copy as they are completely useless.  I was really looking forward to purchasing this movie but will now go with a single-disc edition (if available) or not buy it at all.  Give us back the regular Digital Copy, WB!!!!

B0043X8M0K|4.0|I think the only problem is that the show has SO much music that it's going to be hard getting a lot of it onto a soundtrack, but this is a very full CD and quite representative. I had some songs already from artists like Placebo and Bat for Lashes.   The show has only released one soundtrack...just one. It would have been nice if they had released a soundtrack for each season, then maybe they would have a better representation because they've featured some awesome music. Of course, if the artist isn't willing to offer up their music, then what is the music producers to do?  I bought the soundtrack, which was a good start, but have filled in with mp3s of my favorites and now have an incredible TVD playlist.

B005J4TLQG|4.0|Here's a terrific little film that asks: What if angry, human-devouring aliens landed in South London and had to deal with a mixed ethnicity teen street gang?  Crude, profane and funny, this exceptionally well-crafted little UK import hits all the right notes and delivers a superbly poetic, colorful enigmatic stream of British lower-class teen jargon along the way.  The kid actors, many of them non-pros, are all terrific and the story reminds how a greater threat can unite and makes us stronger.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|Discovering the meaning of life (if any) is not a task for the faint of heart.  Terrence Malick's films have all dealt in some way with the mystery of existence, the wonder, beauty and awe of nature and the cosmos against the pain of our mortality so rife with suffering, doubt and disappointment.  Malick's long-gestating mystical, maddening, obtuse, brilliant and inspired masterpiece offers no easy answers but is a living tapestry that provides a head-space for a challenging meditation that taps into the big questions of grace, God, evolution and death.<br /><br />On first viewing, I was enthralled and since then have had intense discussions with movie buffs and theologians who loved, hated or were puzzled by this movie that transcends description and definition yet for me remains an emotional and spiritual experience.  The story is simple: A 1950's rural Texas family comes to terms with itself against the ferocious mystery of Creation itself.  Note: The enigmatic writer-director Malick grew up in rural Texas in the same time period as his film.  He studied philosophy at Harvard and was awarded a PhD from Oxford.<br /><br />Perhaps the true meaning of life is in embracing -- and loving -- the mystery?
B000UR9QHQ|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The 2.35:1 video was very good; great for a movie this old.  I only saw grain towards the end of the movie, in dark scenes.<br /><br />The audio was only Dolby Digital 5.1. It was adequate.<br /><br />The movie lasted just about 90 minutes.
B0058ZPNOK|1.0|This well-acted pile of pretentious crap stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a viscerally repellant, psychotic misfit who literally invades -- and stays -- in the home of a grieving, newly-widowed father (Rainn Wilson), his young son (superbly played by Devin Brochu) and the sweet grandmother (Piper Laurie) who lives with them.  Natalie Portman is a checkout clerk who is reluctantly attached to Hesher and the young boy.  The performances are all fine, but the story goes nowhere, is profoundly depressing and devoid of insight - or art.  If this passes as entertainment in your world, it's time to get professional help.

B005MSD75U|2.0|You should know that things are not OK when animals start talking to you.  Right?  Well, instead of upping the lithium or seeing a shrink, Kevin James, a lovelorn zookeeper, actually listens to the stupid advice the animals in his care share about finding and keeping a mate.  Naturally, things do not go well when he applies animal habits to his human problems.  This wildly uneven film has a few laugh-out-loud moments, especially in the too infrequent throwaway lines (Gorilla: \\"Hey, can I try on your watch?\\") the animals toss out.<br /><br />But by far, the best thing about this misfire is the nice animal voice work and special effects. I especially liked the animatronic gorilla head with its uncanny lifelike facial movements that were not CGI.  Inexplicably, Kevin James remains a sweet, rotund comic foil.  But the public's affection will soon wear thin unless he takes more care in crafting his screenplays so that it all makes sense and more importantly, has some kind of authentic underlying meaning.

B004EPZ08E|3.0|The best thing about this darkly comic romp is the lecherous dentist Jennifer Aniston effortlessly inhabits.  A big-screen hit, a 106-minute home video version features a slightly edgier cut as three inept employees team up to murder their tormenting bosses.  Yes, it's insanely crazy behavior, but we actually cheer them on until we come to our senses after final fade out and ask ourselves: What was I thinking?<br /><br />Apparently vengeance is wired into our genes.

1609611543|5.0|Every year several books are written by persons with good credentials, claiming that some foodstuff or specific pathogen is causing nearly all of mankind's ills (and some of those of our animal friends); if only we knew it we could all be cured. And I can still hear my dear departed stepfather, a respected practitioner of internal medicine, railing that some newly-discovered source-of-all-ills was exactly the same as one touted forty years before, forgotten and now once again being trumpeted by someone new yearning to make a name for himself. Round and round we go, he would say.<br /><br />That said, this reviewer happens to have developed celiac disease in, uh, rather late middle age. Didn't have it earlier, didn't have very many physical problems at all earlier. In my case, still slender. Complained for a couple of years to appropriate medical persons about intestinal distress but suggestion of celiac disease was never forthcoming. Younger brother suddenly decided to have DNA analysis which turned up predisposition to celiac disease and caused yours truly to investigate by eliminating gluten. Bingo! So here is someone who KNOWS wheat is a problem.<br /><br />The surprise in this book is the author's assertion that the wheat that nourished our ancestors is no longer what we're eating today: In the past fifty years, wheat has been genetically changed by scientists to greatly increase yield and usability (elasticity) as well as increase resistance to fungi and drought, the problem being an unwanted side effect: its glutens were also genetically modified. Of course, you realize these wheat breedings were done in the days prior to the type of genetic modification that has caused the outcry of the past decade and subsequent safety testing to determine suitability for consumption. This chapter on genetic modification I found fascinating (but I have a background in genetics). Dr. Davis' information makes me wonder about my late onset celiac problem, a phenomenon recently more common. Is this in response to relatively recent modification of genes in the D genome of \\"Triticum aestivum\\"?<br /><br />The next relevant concept is that the glycemic index of wheat, be it refined or whole grain, is extremely high. Dr. Davis explains why. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand his cogent explanation. This means ingestion of wheat products produces a blood sugar spike worse than soda or candy. Problem for diabetics and dieters? You bet!<br /><br />Dr. Davis tells us of his medical experience in which patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome and/or acid reflux, both far more common than celiac disease; those patients lacking markers for celiac, have marked improvement upon elimination of gluten from their diets. He goes on to discuss the potentially harmful additives snuck in by manufacturers and bakers, the addictiveness of wheat, connections with mental illness, obesity, intestinal woes, allergies, diabetes, the body's pH, osteoporosis, heart disease, a variety of skin diseases, neurological symptoms and more. Oops, what did I say in the first paragraph? But what if he's right?<br /><br />So do I think this is yet another of the re-run discoveries that would have had the good doctor of my opening paragraph belly-aching about his upwardly-mobile colleagues? In a word, no. Everything Dr. Davis has written here rings true. His presentation is the first I have heard of certain reasoning that makes eminent sense, most particularly about the change in the genetic composition of wheat in the past fifty years. My advice is to read and heed.in response to relatively recent modification of genes in the D genome of \\"Triticum aestivum\\"?

B004GHEBGW|5.0|'Colditz' was I think never broadcast in the US, not even on PBS, but it's a Brit classic. Made in 1972/3, it stars David McCallum and Robert Wagner among many others, and focuses on the fear, isolation, cold, danger and indeed, the relentless boredom of being a PoW in an inaccessible location.<br /><br />It was immensely popular in the UK on first transmission but very rarely repeated. Having just been re-run on a popular history-themed channel, it's gained a new following. I remember watching it a pre-teenager and not really getting it; as an adult I can really appreciate it. Obviously a lot of the episodes centre on escape attempts - watch out in particular for the award-winning episode 'Tweedledum', in which an RAF pilot tries to escape by a novel methos i.e. trying to get repatriated by fooling his German captors into thinking he's insane - with tragic and very moving consequences.<br /><br />The Germans are on the whole portrayed as decent individuals who are just trying to do their jobs (with one notable exception in season 2) so thankfully it avoids the usual goose-stepping Nazi stereotypes.<br /><br />Worth a look. You won't regret it.  Note: don't confuse this with the more recent and more forgettable 'Colditz: the 2-part mini-series' or other similar titles. This one is the real deal.
B002VECM72|1.0|There is a reason Oker wants nothing to do with this dribble. Pointless, untrue, stupid pandering.

1594744769|5.0|I read several reviews over the past few months about the young adult book, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, by Ransom Riggs. The reviews all said that the book was strange but compelling. I definitely have to agree. It is one of the strangest books for young people that I have ever read.  It is definitely a beautiful book. There pages are embellished with designs by the page numbers and there are numerous photos of the characters in the book. The writing is clear and crisp and descriptive. I have discovered another page-turner.  The story centers around sixteen-year-old Jacob Portman. He is intelligent but clumsy, and doesn't make friends easily. He never seems to fit in anywhere.  Jake is very close to his grandfather, Abe Portman, who is an unusual fellow himself. Abe's Jewish family was killed when he was a child and he was sent to an orphanage on Cairnholm Island in Wales. He served in the military and accumulated quite a collection of weapons that are locked in a trunk at home. He tells fantastic stories about his life at the orphanage and the \\"peculiar\\" children who lived there, monsters who were and are after him. He shows Jacob strange photos of children who float above the ground, lift huge boulders and just look weird. When Jacob is small, he believes these stories and is fascinated by them. As he grows older, he realizes that it's all make-believe.  One day, Jacob finds Abe in the backyard with terrible wounds and covered in blood. His dying words are, \\"find the bird, in the loop.\\" Understandably, Jacob freaks out. He later discovers a letter to Abe from a Miss Peregrine, the headmistress of the orphanage. His curiosity is piqued.  After a few months, Jacob and his father travel to Cairnholm Island for Jacob to see the orphanage for himself and try to get a little closure on the terrible episode in his life. His father looks for unusual birds for his bird book.  The orphanage is in ruins, bombed in the attack of September 3, 1940. Jacob explores the decrepit house and finds his way into a cairn or cave. To his shock and horror, he has traveled back in time \\"through a loop\\" to that very day. And, that day repeats over and over and over, thus, the loop.  The orphanage is beautiful and the peculiar children are everywhere. Among others, there is Claire who has an extra mouth under her hair on the back of her head; super strong Bronwyn; Emma Bloom, his grandfather's childhood girlfriend who can produce fire; the invisible Millard. The children hide from wights - and hollows - the monsters Abe always told him about.  Jacob discovers that he is peculiar, as well. He can actually SEE the monsters, where the others can't. He and the other peculiars try to save Miss Peregrine, \\"the bird,\\" from death.  The story has a surprising ending - at least to me, but I liked it.
1932100660|5.0|The one thing I found repeated in most negative reviews here is, 'The chinese are not vegeterian!' The book gets one star for this reason. But wait, where did the author say that ALL Chinese are vegetarian and he has pitted the study as Vegetarian China Vs Meat eating US?  What I understand is, the study is about disease trend in a large population with same race (hence genetics) and varied dietary habits. Different pockets in rural China have vastly different eating habits ranging from almost vegetarian to meat-eaters (even though the meat consumption is not as high as US. What matters is the ratio of plant and animal foods.)   Unlike US, where mainstay of the diet is same all over with slight differences. Deep dish Chicago Pizza, California kitchen pizza or New York style Pizza. Same thing nutrition wise. No point studying regional trends in disease in US. If you do that just for the sake of statistic, there is no way you could relate diet and health or lack thereof.  Consider Indian cuisine where a North Indian person's lunch plate looks vastly different from a South Indian. India has as varied diets as China. Cuisines change every few miles you travel in the country. If there is a similar INDIA STUDY done, it would be very revealing for sure.   Again, I am not saying Indian/ CHinese or any other food is the ultimate healthy food. Just that the regional variety in food that exists in these countries is an ideal playground for researchers.  Why is this concept so difficult to understand people?
0385534639|5.0|I was hesitant when this book was stated to be \\"the next Harry Potter\\". Let's just say I couldn't put this book down and read it in a day. It really is AMAZING. After reading Harry Potter and the Hunger Games I was looking for a book that could pull me in to a new dimension. This did not let me down!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|UPDATE:  November 30, 2011 - Still totally happy with this case and screen cover, and I today ordered a second one for my wife's new 4S which just arrived.  It must be popular, as this was out of stock for the last month and only just became available again [end of update].   I ordered this case at the same time I ordered my first iPhone, the new 4S, based on the low price and the good reviews (and comments from a friend who lives by his iPhone around the world, who said buying an expensive case was of little utility).  It came the same day as the new phone, and after I got the phone initially set up I put the case on it (but not the screen protector).  The case fits perfectly, has a good, solid feel, does not materially (to my thinking) detract from the elegance of the phone, and seems to provide good protection.  However, after I got the phone fully set up (getting iCloud and other elements operating), I removed the case and installed the screen protector.  I've never had a perfect installation of one of these screen protectors on any phone, and this was no exception. Even though I first used a paper towel lightly dampened with Windex to remove any finger oil, and then used the microfiber cloth that comes with the screen protector to wipe it a bit more, I still got a few specks of something between the protector and the screen.  Fortunately with the little \\"paddle\\" that comes with the case, I was able to diminish greatly the effect of the specks, but they are there.  I don't know how one can do this perfectly.  Now, here's the real rub.  I then began replacing the case.  I had not turned the phone off when I began this process, and it began making noises and the audio translation returned.  After I got it on, I discovered that somehow I had apparently reset the passcode.  Of course I had no idea what I had reset it to.  After several minutes of panic, and poring through the Web for answers, I found a solution in the iPhone database.  It was to restore the phone toits original factory settings from the iCloud backup.  This took HOURS - five or so - because it had to reload the entire operating system as well as some other elements.  After sweating through that process, all turned out OK.  But it was no fun.    So the lesson learned - and passed on here - is this:  Turn the damn phone off before you put the case on it!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|This movie was unfairly trashed by critics. Well, I never saw the original version of the film but I just saw the extended version and I don't see what the big problem was. I have heard that the extended cut explains more about the green lanterns at the beginning, which will probably make it easier for people not familiar with the Green Lantern to understand the movie. But to anybody who is familiar with the Green Lantern, this is a fairly good adaptation of the comic book. Don't get me wrong, it is no masterpiece. Certain parts of if come off a little cheesy. But if you are a Green Lantern fan already, I think you will probably at least like most of this movie. And the sequel that it sets up for looks to be cooler than this one. If you are familiar with the Sinestro comic book storyline, you know the series gets darker.
1603580557|5.0|It's hard to explain how much this book can expand your mind if you only allow it to.  The author explains and shows with incredibly diverse examples how systems thinking can give you a whole new perspective on how the world functions. In the end, however, she cautions you against believing that your new-found knowledge can give you superpowers to bend reality to your will. Her message is humbling: you leave with a renewed realization of the world's complexity, the structure of which we can glimpse and appreciate, but begin to think you know everything and that complexity will smack the back of your head when you're not looking.  In the end your takeaway can be the ability to look at the world with the wonder of a newborn; at the same time you suffer a loss of innocence when you realize how hard it is to prevent bad things from happening.  Greatly expanding your mind, while making sure you understand that it is not the end, but the beginning of a journey towards understanding the world. What more can you expect from a book?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game can b very addictive. I find it hard to put down even if I don't get those pigs after a couple tries :D

B000WZAE1I|4.0|Stardust mixes fairytale romance, adventure, magic, suspense, and humor to provide a fun and always entertaining experience for any audience. It is not quite as glorious as a masterpiece like the Lord of the Rings, but it is easily worthy of 4 stars. 4/5
B004ZH66XO|4.0|What a fun little game!  It does get old after a while but it's creative and cute.  Took one star away, however, because there isn't enough variety in the game.  The first time I played it I played for a while, but after that it was quite a long time before I came back to it, and even then I only played for a short time.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Thomas Bergersen has done it again. This is a superb album with an amazing variety of songs. From epic, almost thunderous moments in Starvation, to the the soft sound of Remember Me, this has something for everyone. 5/5 stars
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Warning: Opening scene:<br /><br />The movie starts out funny. Steve Carrol and his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) are sitting at a restaurant. Steve asks his wife what she wants. She blurts out, \\" A divorce.\\" On the way home Steve jumps out of the car. When they get home, the babysitter asks, \\"What happened to you?\\" Steve very dryly says, \\"Emily said she wanted a divorce and I jumped out of the car.\\" Meanwhile Emily is discussing with the sitter about her child and broccoli. The sitter had walked in on the 13 year old boy while he was choking his chicken. He in turn tells the babysitter he was thinking of her. This beginning scene had me hooked...then Emma Stone comes on the screen as icing on the cake. 5 star opening scene. Oh and the 17 year old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) has taken a liking to Steve.<br /><br />Steve does not take the divorce very well. He goes to a bar and pours out his grief to anyone who will listen and sometimes he talks to the thin air. He is taken in under the tutoring of pick-up artist Ryan Gosling who guarantees to make this sad sack into a lady killer. Steve does very well until he opens his mouth. When he talks he makes women want to leave the bar....with Ryan Gosling. Eventually Steve becomes a master Jedi. Kevin Bacon plays David Lindhagen, the \\"other man.\\"<br /><br />The movie has many LOL moments, great characters and great actors with a wonderful climax scene. From the title you should be able to figure out this is a chick flick.
B002LVUKIS|4.0|I should start off by saying that I love the Thief I & Thief II. There is a reason they enjoy such a cult fan base. They are superb games. That being said, these are very old games. You should not get them if you are turned off by bad graphics and primitive physics. You should also be aware that many people have issues with these two games. Sometimes they cannot get them to work properly. Thief: Deadly Shadows, to my knowledge, has no such issues. It is a much newer game and enjoys the superior graphics that comes with that. That being said, however, I enjoy the first two a little more as I liked their storylines more.  If you enjoy suspense and stealth, then these are the games for you! 4/5 stars

1935251740|5.0|This is a great book that introduces a provocative new paradigm of scientific thought towards the role of consciousness in the universe in a thoughtful and well considered manner.  The 1-star reviews are more a reflection of the bias of the reviewers, not the book itself. (This is a typical fingerprint when you find a highly rated book with so many 1-star reviews.) Another thing, any notion that this book is an argument for God or religion is complete self-manufactured delusion on the part of some of these reviewers; this book is silent on such matters.  This is not a physics textbook; this is a book that challenges the world view of physics (really, all science) based on sound logical arguments. It includes history & philosophy so as to ask the question \\"How did we get here?\\" (w.r.t. the current world view of physics) and \\"Why do we cling to the current interpretations of quantum physics to support the traditional world view of science?\\" In asking those questions, this book offers an outstanding and thought provoking read.  You might disagree with the conclusions of this book but the ideas are well constructed; it is definitely interesting and worthwhile. This book does not challenge the science of quantum physics (per se); it does challenge the interpretations that can be drawn from it. Interpretations of quantum physics are inherently philosophical in nature and not scientific fact, therefore the notion that the authors employ classical logical (in some cases) to argue their points is to be expected and certainly fair.  If you believe that consciousness (the observer) will never be required to understand the universe (or the physics we use to understand it), then you will not agree with the conclusions of this book. That said, if you hold these beliefs but are open to the consideration of another interpretation that requires the observer on equal footing with time & space, you will find this book intriguing and will enjoy it even if it falls short of convincing you otherwise.   This is a book for \\"big thinkers\\" not the \\"shut-up and compute\\" crowd.
0439023521|4.0|I have to admit, when I first stated reading this book it was for business-related purposes to familiarize myself with the book's marketing campaign. The premise really didn't sound feasible to me with gladiator children thrown into an arena to fight for the lives until only one child out of 24 young \\"tributes\\" was left standing. I had a really hard time grasping the concept of the book, but admittedly, I was sucked into this post-apocalyptic world of fantasy as I found myself relating to the character, Katniss, protecting her sister by taking her place as their district's tribute, wanting to stick it to the man so to speak, otherwise known as the gamemakers, and fighting for survival. It's a brutal book with lots of violence and cliffhanger chapters that make your want to keep reading until before you know it, you've finished the book and ready for the next.
B003L20ICE|4.0|THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT serves notice that family units are family units--no matter the orientation of the parents.  Homework still needs to be done, teen angst and restlessness still need to be nurtured and addressed, and partners--after years and years of being together--still get on one another's nerves.  Thus we have Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore), and their two (artifically inseminated) children, Joni and Laser (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson), in what on its face appears to be an idyllic family setting, with Nic the breadwinner and Jules more or less maintaining the home front; but once the kiddos decide it's time to meet Paul, their biological father (Mark Ruffalo), this family dynamic suddenly flips onto its dysfunctional ear.  Accordingly the film becomes humorous, poignant, and compelling--all at once.<br /><br />The complexity of the characters (or, in Paul's case, the remarkable lack thereof) lends solid believability to the story, with Jules trying to establish her own identity beyond Nic's authoritative shadow; meanwhile Nic needs to learn to chill the forkle out.  Paul is such a free spirit he instantly attracts the attention of the children--then Jules; once the family is in disarray the viewer wonders if the pieces can be put back together, or if the damage is irreparable.  Indeed there is a resolution, of sorts, with Paul a red herring scapegoat, yet THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT strikes a cumulative chord of bonding and love, transcending orientation or societal bias.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

B004WR125O|5.0|It's only a wireless adapter for the Onkyo TX-NR609, so there's nothing much to tell.  Hooked it to the receiver and it was identified immediately. However, I couldn't connect it to my wireless network.  Turns out that an updated firmware of the receiver was necessary.  Speed is very good. Streaming radio stations as well as the very cool AUPEO service without any issues on my slow and old Wireless G network connected with 5 Megabit broadband.  Just BTW, for all you buyers out there, if you try updating firmware for the Onkyo receiver from a USB stick, you have to:  1. use a very simple USB stick. The receiver cannot work with SanDisk USB sticks for example (found that the hard way)...  2. Use a FAT32 formatted USB stick. Onkyo won't read NTFS.  Good luck.

It is about people's \\"snap judgement\\", and how it effects our everyday life. It is amazing how in a split second we can make a judgement about something, and react without even thinking about it. A truely powerful and moving book. The author gives examples of \\"snap judgement\\" and the effects which made my jaw drop. I learned alot from this book, and am more careful about how I perceive things.<br /><br />-Jenn
B005I64U5C|1.0|While the 3D Blu-ray edition of Green Lantern does indeed include the extended version of the film (despite it strangely not being advertised on the cover or in the description), that extended edition is NOT 3D. It's not even seamless branching that would allow you to watch all the already-3D scenes in 3D with the added scenes in 2D. It's either/or - you either watch the 3D Theatrical version, or you watch the 2D Extended version.  And the Digital Copy is NOT a digital copy! The included \\"digital copy\\" code allows you to watch a streaming online version of the movie via UltraViolet and Flixster. You can't watch it unless you download the appropriate software and have an internet connection because NO DIGITAL COPY DISC IS INCLUDED. You cannot watch this \\"digital copy\\" of Green Lantern any place where a Wi-Fi connection is unavailable.  Why Warners chose their least-successful superhero movie to try this sort of scam is beyond me. I was one of the minority who really enjoyed Green Lantern in the theater, but I was also looking forward to the extended edition to see if it improved the movie (like the Lord of the Rings extended editions did for those films). But if I'm spending the extra money for a 3D Blu-ray, then the Extended Edition darn well better be in 3D too!!  Very, very, very disappointed. Glad I was able to see my friend's copy of this before I wasted my money.  If the extended version is ever released in 3D like it should have been from the start, then I'll be first in line to buy it and will probably give *that* Blu-ray five stars (unless the Digital Copy is still a scam).
B0000013G9|5.0|This album will definitely bring back plenty of memories if you were a kid or a teenager or even an adult back when this album was made and it's quite soulful. Smart lyrics, smooth beats. If you weren't around during this time or were too young to remember this album, you will fall in love with it. This is what's missing in today's pop music, for sure.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I had trouble scanning my documents to send over email via scanner when I decided to give up and take a picture over mobile phone, but before I did I thought an app existed for such a need...low and behold I came across this app, to my surprise after 3 clicks and 30 seconds, I accomplished what I was trying to do for several hours on a real scanner! it even has some cool cropping features and editng effects to make it look like a scan....amazing app, best of all...its free!
B005P06AAO|5.0|There's two shows this show reminds me of. It's a mix of Daria and My Life as Liz, completely. Jenna is a character any one who was (or is) the outcast in high school could relate to. The humor in it is well delivered and the storyline is one that will reel you in.
0792846443|5.0|The DVD worked perfectly and was new as described!  I watched this movie with my 13 year old son and he thought it was great!  A classic thriller!
B000FZETIO|5.0|To this day, I honestly believe that Molly Ringwald should have gone for Duckie. I know it can't be changed, but even though she doesn't go for Duckie, the movie still has a great storyline of the outcast girl. It was well written by John Hughes, but what of John Hughes, was not written well?
B000FZETKC|5.0|I would order from this seller again!  I love this movie as much as I did when I was a teen!  I would love to see the John Hughes movies make a come back, they were amazing!
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|This was recommended to me by Amazon and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the vocals that this woman offers. I like how they also seem to be mixing genres to make such a great product. Very good album. None of the songs sound the same either, there's no real repetition.
B004SGWYVA|2.0|I don't feel the need to explain every ridiculous moment of this series so to sum it up for those interested in an honest review...WAY TOO MUCH FAN SERVICE!!! girls running around in their underwear as the world around them is collapsing to piles of rubble is utter madness!! To give credit where credit is due I'd have to mention the background animation was stunning. I enjoy massive gore in a zombie flick as  much as the next horror fanatic but the humor and fan service totally tipped the scales and I personally lost interest mid-series. I appreciate that an anime zombie series was created, unfortunately it totally failed to keep me invested in the story or its characters.
B000001Y79|5.0|Another album that reminds me of my childhood, a great album. Every track has something new with a different twist. No one track sounds the same. Yes, it's different than the albums before it (always a surprise to people that there were No Doubt albums before this), but it still had a great alternative punch. Gwen Stefani has shown the world she can do ska music, alternative rock, hip hop, pop, and who knows what's next with No Doubt's return coming about, but this album is the one that reminds me of my childhood so it will always hold a special place. Who could ever forget how popular Don't Speak was?

I could have saved myself so much time straightening and stress about humidity!
0670022411|1.0|I drive solo alot and like to bring along a \\"book on tape\\" as company.. just finished Huckleberry Finn on my way through Missouri and found myself laughing out loud again and again. My next \\"book on tape\\" would be \\"A Discovery of Witches\\", listening to the CD version while I was driving up through Northern California .. I had been on a wait list a month or two to get this from my local library and really looked forward to it. I felt like a good romance (my favorite novel of all time is Jane Eyre). I made it through about 4 hours of Witches  about 1/5 of the way through). It was drop-dead boring. So much repetition. Words like \\"boudleian library\\" and \\"the vampire\\" get used every other sentence so they lose their impact. And all the descriptions of Oxford just sound like name dropping. If you are a really visual person and like to hear about every detail about the change of outfits of the two main characters you might really get into it.  Or what they're eating (or not eating, as the case may be). Personally, when it comes to fiction, the story line drives the narrative. And after 4 or 5 hours of listening to this book on tape, I was still waiting for the story to emerge. Or for some light to be shed on the characters to make them a little more interesting. After 5 hours of listening, I couldn't take it anymore.. at that point, didn't really care about the two lovers. I returned it to the library with 80% left to go, so someone else can have their go at it. Hadn't read any reviews until tonight on Amazon and am relieved to see I have alot of company. Wish I had read the reviews sooner. I still would have launched into the book, but probably would have given up alot sooner, so I could begin listening to another good story. Still think books on tape are a great way to enjoy a road trip... (if you have a really long road trip ahead.. Ken Follett books are a good company)

B003UYV08E|1.0|This sequel had about as much personality as my kitchen blender. Why the meaningless cameo by Samuel Jackson? Scarlett Johansson walks in and out, except for a nice bout throwing men around like tenpins. Gwyneth Paltrow adds a little much-needed humanity, and Robert Downey might just as well have worn his iron suit throughout. There is no difference. Same for Don Cheadle. Mickey Rourke's sly Russian physicist is appealing, which is all I can say about the film AND the cast.
B000VUCIZO|1.0|I love Woz and Jobs both, I love Apple, I love their story, but I was really disappointed in this book.  In the end, I didn't get anything out of it that I think I hadn't already gotten from various magazine articles that I read over the years.  The grade reading level is about 3rd grade which put me off a great deal to start with.  In all, it seemed like they were trying to find enough material to make a book so kept regurgitating the same points over and over.  I think it might have gone better for him had he had a good interviewer helping him tickle out infformation from the past.  Maybe a ghostwriter might have helped it along because I do believe that he has an interesting and important story to tell; it just didn't make it to this book.
072325804X|5.0|Thanks ever so much for selling this to me!  I remember my father reading these stories to me when I was a boy, about my son's age.  His was a beat up smaller version with a brown cover.  This is beautifully illustrated, large type (compared to the book my father had), hard bound and printed on high quality paper.  It has the beauty of a book to hand down, which is appropriate for a collection of timeless stories.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read to their children a set of classic stories about morality cloaked in tales of animal adventures!
0143038583|5.0|This is a transformative book. I long ago stopped buying meat at Safeway or Giant and now I know why. So much of what Michael Pollan has chronicled in this book has filtered down into the general consciousness. This book and his subsequent works have been bestsellers and his ideas were a big part of the documentary Food Inc.<br /><br />It's not just that Pollan does some great reporting -- visiting the cattle feed lots and corn fields of modern industrial agriculture, reading a massive amount of literature on food production, and doing a George Plimpton by going to Joel Salatin's Polyface farm and hunting wild pig with a Sicilian emigre -- but he relentlessly analyzes, reasons, reflects. And he does so in a lucid, intelligent prose that is laced with rich humor.<br /><br />In the key chapter that explains the title of the book, Pollan describes how eating many kinds of food as do omnivores like rats and human increases brain capacity because of the choices that must be made. He contrasts that with animals like the koala bear who eat only one thing, such as eucalyptus leaves. \\"Eating might be simpler as a thimble-brained monophage, but it's also a lot more precarious, which partly explains why there are so many more rats and humans in the world than koalas. Should a disease or drought strike the eucalyptus trees in your neck of the woods, that's it for you. But the rat and human can live just about anywhere on earth, and when their familiar foods are in short supply, there's always another they can try.\\"<br /><br />Fungi are apparently neither animal nor vegetable and this whole chapter is hilarious. Pollan describes why people find mushrooms mysterious and somewhat off-putting. \\"That the fungi are so steeped in death might account for much of their mystery and our mycophobia. They stand on the threshold between the living and the dead, breaking the dead down into food for the living, a process on which no one likes to dwell.\\"<br /><br />But of course the real meat of the book, so to speak, is Pollan's vivid and damning description of where the meat at McDonald's or Safeway comes from. His patient tracing of industrial food from subsidized corn through the CAFO to the terrible process that produces ground beef. E. coli, obesity, and a host of ills are traced back to bad food.<br /><br />What struck me is how relatively recent the really bad stuff is. The misguided agricultural subsidies started under Earl Butz, Nixon's Agriculture secretary. I grew up in a different world and much of this pernicious development took place while I was in Europe. European agriculture has been industrialized as well, of course, but never to the same extent and the backlash started much earlier than here. England is a good 10 years ahead of us in food awareness, I know from my friend Sheila Dillon at the BBC Food Programme.<br /><br />But the awareness is growing here. The Joel Salatin chapters are such an eye opener, as Pollan meticulously describes the genuinely organic loop at Polyface Farm, where it all starts with grass. Polyface is only a couple hours' drive from here, so it's easy to relate to. Not sure to what extent I'll jump on the locavore bandwagon, though I'm already on it to a much greater extent than I was a year ago.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|I bought a 3D TV only to find out that the selection of 3D Blu-rays absolutely sucks. Half of them are kids movies but the 3D warning says kids aren't supposed to watch 3D movies. No wonder so many people think 3D is a gimmick.  The only great things about 3D so far, are some of the PS3 games.  my fav right now is God Of War: Origins collection  I want in 3D now!  Kung fu panda 2  transformers: dark of the moon  avatar - available to the public at reasonable price instead of one-hundred-sixty bucks(what a crock, can't believe such a good director sold his soul to panasonic)   Wake up, hollywood.  Between the economy and the lack of 3D content, I think America's going to hell. They've got their heads too far up their asses and low IQs too. The only thing America is #1 at is creating weapons of mass destruction
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|I saw Trombone Shorty Playing on a talk show, and immediately, wrote down the name of the band and search for it on Amazon..it's such a relief to hear good refreshing music this days, that has to do so little with electronics, I mean, \\" For True \\" does not have a \\" filler \\" song. They're all good, and the fact that Mr. Jeff Beck plays in one song, Kid Rock sings on another  among other collaborations, from other fine musicians  doesn't hurt either.   I recommend this CD 100%, it has elements of rock, funk, R & B, Jazz...very entertaining.

B005HXGE9G|5.0|New Blood reimagines some of Peter Gabriel's most emotionally resonant works with an orchestral voice that is oddly true to the originals.  In fact, most of the arrangements reveal the best and brightest aspects of the original songs, albeit, with a symphonic passion that is very different from the originals. The Peter Gabriel fans who have given this CD a poor rating either dislike classical music or fail to appreciate the innovative and collaborative nature of Gabriel's best work.  I, for one, am grateful that Peter Gabriel continues to produce music that encourages people to embrace the new, particularly in the context of reconceptualizing the old.

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|My son, who is six, owns just about every car and collectable from the first movie.  As a family, we have watched CARS (the original) no fewer than 300 times... and THAT is not an over statement - it's true.  We ALL loved the original movie.<br /><br />The second movie was awful.  Just aaaaaaaaaaawful!  My son couldn't sit still, we went to the theatre and he hated the whole thing, start to finish.  I'm someone who really does not enjoy Michaal Cain - and when I tell you that he was my favorite part of the movie - that should speak volumes.<br /><br />What a bust for Pixar.  Who fell asleep at the helm of this project?!?<br /><br />As for the actual Blue Ray and digital copy - I'm not reviewing that.  The quality is probably fantastic... it's the content that was horrible.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I almost did not watch this movie due to the bad reviews I've read here. But after watching it and forming my own opinion, I really do not get what the negativity was all about. True, I did not read the novel but every movie made based on a novel always comes out short because they cannot fit everything in a 2 hour movie (and this one is only about an hour and half). Geez, I read the complaints in the other reviews saying, \\"why is there a witch\\" or \\"it's so unbelievable\\". Well, duh! How will there be a curse if there isn't a witch to put the curse? Yeah, and are werewolves and vampires more believable? It's a good movie with a good moral (inside beauty is more important than outer beauty). No sex, no cussing -- which isn't necessary in this movie anyway. Alex Pettyfer is such an eye candy, so that's a plus. Of course, there are holes in the story (like why is Vanessa Hudgens' dad not in jail after he shot someone) but if you look at the main point which is  the love story, it all works.

1612930441|4.0|My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book.

0385534639|5.0|If Neil Gaiman dreamed with Tim Burton, I think they would have something similar to The Night Circus. With elements of Something Wicked This Way Comes, Neverwhere, Moulin Rouge and Alice in Wonderland it is a dream I never wanted to wake from. Brava Erin Morgenstern! One of the best books I have read in a very long time!
0307477479|5.0|Think of a novelized screenplay for a wicked-funny TV series co-written by  a cultural anthropologist, a linguist, and a publicist. Flashing forwards & backwards. Sketchy continuity. Writing that goes down like well-aged, buttery chardonnay. Peaking now in smell and taste. Drink it now before it passes its prime.
030788743X|5.0|I normally avoid sci-fi like the plague but my new library mixes genres in the new release section so I picked this up and read the jacket. I was hooked before I even got started and haven't been that into a book for too long to remember. Excellent story and writing, although I skipped some more of the technical gamer stuff (last system I had was Super Nintendo ;)This has action, adventure, love, fantasy and futuristic aspects that are so believeable and realistic-it's made me want to try more sci-fi. Although I would bet they aren't all this good!!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Good, but muy blu ray player is old, and take a lot time to see the movie.  In 6.1 HD Sound, take a jump every 50 sec. In Spanish 5.1 was fine.  Everything OK.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I specifically DO NOT want anything but the movies themselves, so I'm tickled that I can get what I do want--just the movies.  Whooeeee!
B004HW7JMO|4.0|I love this series. Wish it was a little longer but it hit the spot. The fight and sex scenes are incredible. Trust me you will not be disappointed. RIP Andy Whitfield.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I just purchased this cpu for a new gaming pc I am builing.  Tiger Direct/Compusa has it onsale for 220.00 right now.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This exquisitely crafted story gives an incredible glimpse into real events in the relatively recent history of Afghanistan through the touching story of two women whose lives are brought together as 2 wives of an abusive man. There are many heartbreaking events but yet one finishes the story feeling a hope that there is goodness in a cruel world. I shed many tears but was inspired by the characters in this book. Mr Hosseini is a genius. I, like many others, anxiously awaits his next book.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Purchased this item and was shipped quickly and efficiently. This product was exactly what I ordered and cheaper then any other place that I had searched.
B004XGN8W4|3.0|When it arrived I really liked the solid construction of the unit, it held my 360 slim very securely and the bags were made of some padded mesh material unlike I had ever seen before.  Very cool... Unfortunately, it worked for ONE use..  On initial use it had some strange lines, but only on the XBox menu screens and they were bearable, they did not interfere with gameplay but I was a little concerned. I handled it like a newborn baby (although I am sure it is capable of handling being stored in an overhead compartment for a long flight with moderate turbulence). The next time I tried to use it, the first thing I noticed was the on screen Logo that had last time come up RED was now YELLOW... Then the middle third of the screen was all distorted.  Thought it might be the HDMI cable causing the problem, (several people had posted an issue with the short HDMI cable) but even without the XBox OR HDMI cable connected the monitor menu, volume, and brightness were all distorted.  I guess that I was just unlucky and just got a bad unit...  But at this price I cannot afford to risk it happening again.  It's just not as cool if the monitor stops working and I end up with a $300 XBox suitcase.  I really wanted it to work, VERY disappointed.   Also disappointed in the limited viewing angle, the case lid folds back to a particular angle so if you put it on a table or your lap you have to adjust your head to the correct height or loose lots of detail.  Good headphones are a must since the speakers are less than fantastic. And it does not come with any compartment or sleeve to store/transport game discs. The two side latches each come with a small hole to put a security lock, but the loop piece is hard plastic so the lock can be easily removed so it is more of a deterrent than anything.  It was suggested by other users that the holes could also be used to clip on a carry strap, but the strap would need to have very small clasps to fit in the hole and the unit is not designed with this in mind.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I remember reading The Great Gatsby book in high school, but I didn't remember much from the book. Watching this film refresh my memory a bit. It got kinda boring at first but the movie progresses it got more and more interesting. Tom is a rich, racist, hippocript who cheats on his wife and expects her to be submissive. Jay Gatsby is the kind of man that a girl would dream of. He's handsome, charming, smooth, and deep. Nick Carraway is the one that knows and sees everything and doesn't tell a soul. Daisy is the object of Gatsby's desire. His one true love that he never gave up on. I was really hoping that Daisy and Gatsby would be together in the end, but unfortunately it didn't turned out that way. My teacher in college wanted us to watch this film because it has some elements that had inspired the novel \\"Bodega Dreams\\". Gatsby is very much similar to the Bodega character. Nick is similar to Chino. Daisy is similar to the woman that Bodega fell in love with. Both women married to rich men.
B000P0J024|5.0|I was looking for some George Harrison music after seeing the essay on him in Rolling Stone and this came up on Amazon. I thought it might be good, plus there was a DVD of several of their music videos and an interview session. MAN!! This is a great deal with two CD's of great music and the DVD. George Harrison seems to be the mastermind in putting this group together and WHAT A GROUP. Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne put on a real show here and they blend beautifully in voice and playing. There is some great footage of them creating and recording that is priceless because both Harrison and Orbison are no longer with us in person. They are having lots of fun and if you like any one of them you'll love this mix of ALL of them. What was just a chance to get some music turned into a treasure trove to keep for the ages.
B005NPBTQ6|2.0|Let me tell you something. Unlike many, I didn't think Gold was a sell-out move. It wasn't as raw as Heartbreaker, but it was still a good compromise. Even a few years later, Easy Tiger proved Adams could write grown-up music without getting boring. It was definitely more comfortable but wasn't generic. It was still southern pick-up-truck music to me (maybe because I'm not from the south and I don't own a pick-up truck). But this Ashes and Fire album? That's Volvo music.   What's good is that it actually makes me appreciate Heartbreaker's nuances. It was light and heavy at the same time, funny and tragic. Even Gold sounded more subtle than Ashes and Fire. This is dull, repetetitive music. Maybe it'll grow on me. Or maybe I won't find out, because I will give this album to my grandma or something. I'll miss Ryan Adams.
B000DZIGE4|5.0|I've read mixed reviews on this film, but, having a friend who is a Jarhead..it's quite true to form!  Marines can be crude, lol, but that's the way it is!  I love this movie.  I watch it all the time.  War time sucks, no matter what branch of Service you are in.  This is just a perspective from the Marines point of view.  It's not always fighting and battles..it's waiting and boredom.  My husband who was in the Army and served in Desert Storm, said he knows how it was..waiting..bored.  Granted there isn't alot of action involved in this movie..it is still a 5 star in my book!!!  Jake Gyllenhall and Peter Sarsgaard are excellent..and who doesn't enjoy watching Jamie Foxx?  Yes, the language can be quite crass, perhaps even offensive to some.  But, when you've got so many men, in this situation, I suppose you're bound to hear a bit of vulgarity!!! But, the fact that I'm a woman does not deter me from watching it over and over again..love me some Marines!!!  OOH-RAH to all our Marines!!!
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|I love that this story of a woman named Temple Grandin was actually based on a true life. This movie is entertaining , inspirational, and tugs at the emotions in several ways. Claire daines is magnifiscent for someone who is both brilliantly gifted and also uniquely limited. This is a big stepping stone for autisitc \\"einsteins\\" everywhere. I agree that this should be the #1 best rated film on amazon. I have no arguments there. Godbless
B004TTZHBK|1.0|The app does not work on my Toshiba Thive. The screen orientation randomly shifts and then an error is displayed and the app is forced to close. There is no way around this. I am informed by the developer that they are aware of this issue and hope to get this fixed in a future update but for now it does not work on some tablets.<br />Paid $3.99 (1/2 Price sale), value received $0.00<br /><br />Update 12/20/11: Why does Amazon still have this app listed as compatible with the Toshiba Thrive?  After two months, there has been no fix for this major bug that renders this app useless on many tablet.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Just a great album that shows the new sound of Incubus. You'll love it as you listen to it. The two singles are just as different as this is new
B004SBQAN8|4.0|\\"I Am Number Four\\" was much what I expected...but it was the parts I wasn't expecting that really made the movie.<br /><br />I liked the lead - beefcake but decent acting Alex Pettyfer playing Number Four.  I especially liked Timothy Olyphant (from excellent TV program [[ASIN:B0038M2APA Justified: The Complete First Season]] as Number Four's guardian.  Callan McAuliffe as Sam, the human friend, played a good part.  The rest of the cast was just okay - to me.  Oh, I liked the dog a lot.  And the alien monsters and bounty hunters were good.<br /><br />This was a fun movie, worth watching if you like this genre at all.  I won't tell you which parts I wasn't expecting and ruin it for you.  They'll probably be a surprise to you, too.
4770030096|5.0|This is book is a great one to learn Japanese, and I recommend using it along with the kana workbook as it tells you same basics about kana. Then you can come to this book. It covers almost everything you'll use every day. And it also contains great practice questions for you to remember it well.
0062103377|5.0|With three children at home, I find that I pick and choose what I read carefully, as my \\"me time\\" is precious. This book didn't disappoint me in any way. It's truly a treat for any Bobby Singer/Supernatural fan as it delves behind the man and gives us a look at his life and past that we haven't been privvy to before.<br /><br />The book itself is written as though Bobby is writing it just for us, laying out tips for hunting and telling us stories of his past, all to try and salvage what is left of his memories. It seems something attacked Bobby while he was on a hunt and now writing down everything he knows is the only way to piece together what happened to him and see if he can save himself in time.<br /><br />The book was an easy read and was informative, as well as made me laugh out loud with some of his comments.<br /><br />If you've even wondered what makes Bobby Singer the man he is and who he was before we saw him on the show? This is the book you need to get your hands on. Don't be an idjit, grab a copy today!!!
6301971272|5.0|I think that I may have seen this flick in theatres more than any other movie. I was a junior in high school when this was released, and as soon as we heard the theme music on our local station, & read a review in Time Magazine, my best friend & I were all over it. One problem I had from the gitgo was how washed out the film was, but this remastering job is great. Even a couple of scenes that were restored from a Italian print were remastered, and luckily Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are still around to dub in their voices, as well as give insights about the filming. Among the many extras is a documentary about Sibley's War in west Texas and New Mexico, which the film loosely winds around.<br />My only gripe is the box, which is not hinged, but just seems like the type of stationery boxes little old ladies have, and which immediately broke at one corner. But that's a small price to pay for this.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|The game, despite a couple of minor bugs, is tremendously fun. The levels progress nicely in challenge, and my only real disappointment is that there are not more levels.  120 went way too fast.  I also love that solutions can be viewed and shared online once the level is complete.  I've replayed a few levels to make them more efficient or more symmetrical.
0312370830|5.0|I loved Sarah's Key.  I read it in two sittings.  It was a pleasant visceral response.  I only tear a book apart when there are jarring inconsistencies and problems.  With this one, I found none.  It's a matter of taste.  As for the author, I liked her style and loved the interchange of the two stories.  I thought it made the impact of Sarah's greater. Kudos.  I am Franco-American.  There was something about her Gallic sensibility that appealed to me very much. So much so that I found myself sobbing at the end--something I almost never do.  I can't wait to read more of de Rosnay's books.
B004YHRZLM|5.0|Such a great movie, I love that it came to Blu-ray, so happy with it, great for the whole family!
0691152640|4.0|In this academic book \\"This Time is Different,\\" the authors contend that we humans have been getting ourselves into financial folly ever since finance was created.  It's easy to explain why:  Finance is often a tool of political expediency.  When the British used finance to borrow money in order to fund their wars against France, it seemed a far-sighted use of finance (that's because the British won the wars).  When governments around the world permitted the use of finance to land their citizens into mountains and mountains of debt, it seemed a bit short-sighted.  The authors, in clear and incisive writing, went into detail as to how governments found themselves defaulting their sovereign debt, but what the authors fail to explain is why this happens.  And it happens because governments are politically short-sighted, and they, especially democratic governments, will do what is necessary in the short-term to create the illusion of wealth creation (and there's no easier way of doing this than borrowing against the future).  And we know this will continue to happen because 1.  the rewards of doing so are so high (voter approval  2.  the costs of doing so are so low (voters kick you out, and go protest outside Wall Street).    And the costs of doing so will continue to be low because of the principle of \\"odious debt.\\"  If the Greeks would be forced to sell off their islands to the Germans, then that would certainly teach the Greeks never again to be so fiscally irresponsible -- but no one would think this is fair because it'd be the same principle of children going to debtors' prison for their parents' debt.    This time is no different.  And neither will next time.
B001UHOWW4|5.0|Just wonderful to revisit this classic! The quality of film was just like popping in one of this years boxoffice hits in Blu-ray... Thank you!!
B003PIUC02|5.0|The best show.  Not for kids.  Make sure they are not around.  A lot of blood and sex, so if you are weak to the stomach you might not like it.  The guys are HOT also.
B003DT194G|5.0|Sergio Leone's 1968 \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is the Western as epic myth, with superb cinematography, a haunting score, and a story designed to allow the director a series of set piece dramatic scenes.  \\"Once Upon a Time\\" stars Claudia Cardinale as a widow with a valuable piece of property, Henry Fonda playing against type as a vicious killer named Frank who wants to take the property, Jason Robards as the renegade Cheyenne, and Charles Bronson as the lethal harmonica-playing man with no name.<br /><br />At over two and a half hours, the movie takes its own time in presenting the story.  The camera lingers over the magnificent desert scenery and the faces of the actors, while the narrative advances with short spurts of violence and austere dialogue.  The plot takes a while to unfold; the viewer may be well into the movie before the stakes are readily apparent.  The best parts of the movie may be the scenes where the camera circles among the actors, waiting for an inevitable explosion of violence.  An opening sequence, in which a group of armed men await the arrival of the harmonica-playing man, is just such a scene.  The viewer knows how this situation will end but not just how it will unfold.<br /><br />Leone was careful to spread screen time among the leading actors, giving each a chance to develop a distinctive character in spite of the limited dialogue.  The likelihood that most will come to a bad end only adds to the slow building suspense.<br /><br />\\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is not for viewers looking for a quick drama.  This is old-school, slow-rolling movie-making which glories in its own technique.  It is highly recommended to hard-core fans of the spaghetti Western genre, of which it may be the archtype example.
1461190460|5.0|I love this story! I loved it as a child, a college student and now as a Mom. It is a must read for children of all ages and for every parent. Buy this book!
B005VMVUAQ|4.0|There are numerous little twists and unexpected turns in this movie. You will root for the family as they try to figure out a way to save themselves from a group of armed \\"intruders\\". The bad guys have some issues and flaws..which makes this plot feel believable. The well to-do family also has their flaws which will frustrate you when they don't automatically make the right decisions. Really good tense movie.
B004LWZVZC|2.0|Said it was a the 2 disc collectors version but only had one disc and the sender gave us a free movie of something we did not ask for.  Very disappointed.
B0058VW36U|4.0|It was a really fun game but I got all 600 stars and 33 achievements in one day, I wish this had the same amount of features the ios version has.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|One of the best motion picture soundtracks that I have ever purchased. Not to mention how fast I received it.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is offered at a great price and looks great.  The only problem is that if you take it off at night you have to have it back on your arm in 8 hours or it will stop and tenhave to be reset.  Kind of a pain.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|This is my first mechanical watch that I have owned since I was a kid. Well built and plain, but still pleasing to the eye. Watch is a little small and the band is a little narrow, but it is after all, a unisex watch. Very large guys need to look for a slightly larger watch. It sports a well designed \\"flieger\\" style face and exhibition case back. The watch movement is not flashy, but rather workman like in appearance. The sand blasted finish on the bezel is nice. It is quite accurate for an automatic watch(mine is +5 secs a day).I would recommend this watch to anyone from slightly large to small wrists.Very large wrists stay away!Bottom line is, Seiko makes some of the best watches in the world,and this one is no exception(price<quality)
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Great looking blu-ray. What more need be said. There are some titles that were meant to be shot and released in glorious black & white.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game. Enjoy a game and relax. I don't like games that frustrate me. This one is an enjoyment. Worth it.
B005I64U5C|3.0|The 3D disc included with this is pretty much worthless as far as actual 3D content and the fact it's only the theatrical release. I've yet to watch the extended release in 2D but will soon. Also, the Digital copy is pure BS! Shame...Unless you're a diehard 3D fan, skip this version.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I would find it hard for anyone to not like this entire CD.  The artist list joining is astounding.  I cant wait for the third CD to be released.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is a new favorite in our house.  The characters are great and the entire film is quirky, funny, odd, and wonderful.  Love it!
B005974CDU|5.0|I have been a long time DT fan and I must say that I was a little underwhelmed with their last 2 offerings (Systematic Chaos, Black Clouds and Silver Linings).  While the musicianship was, as always, first class, a few of the songs just didn't jump out and grab your attention.  Their latest creation, A Dramatic Turn of Events, is just as the title implies.  Petrucci and the boys are back with a fantastic mix of power, precision, and beauty.  Highlights for me are \\"This is the Life\\", \\"Bridges in the Sky\\", \\"Outcry\\", \\"Breaking all Illusions\\", and the great ballad \\"Beneath the Surface\\".  For those who thought the absence of Mike Portnoy would hurt this group, Mike Mangini fills in more than adequately and everyone certainly seems to have stepped up their game.  This CD is just a fantastic listen.  DT fans will not be disappointed.
6305678715|2.0|I was disappointed that the DVD picture was a strip across the tv screen with large black margins top and bottom, and did not fill my big screen tv.  I checked back on the original ad for the DVD and there was no indication that it was that type of DVD.  I know there used to be two kinds of DVD's; I don't know if that is still the case.
B005529BDK|5.0|well at first i really thought that this was l just another generic puzzle game but oh boy was i wrong. great game!

B004ODLUGM|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my 5 year and 3 year daughters.  They both loved it and I loved that they begged to watch this instead of a Disney Princess or Barbie DVD.  The story is sweet, the animation even sweeter.  Boys would love as well.
B0046MVVOW|4.0|Ke$ha enough said............. I got this in a timely manner and the music is great plus the package was not damaged at all getting to the second cd is tricky i wound up breaking the case but oh well.
0446556750|5.0|Having read all of MC's novels, in chronological order, I found The Reversal to be one of the very best. How a non-lawyer could write such a crackling courtroom drama is beyond me. The interplay between Mickey Haller and Maggie MacFierce is fascinating. Harry plays a pivotal role; MC manages to communicate not just his crusty attitude but his competence and experience. I'll admit that the last few novels have lagged a bit for me. Not this one. This was a stay-up-all-night, finish-it-at-all-costs thriller. MC is still the best of the best.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD SO FLIPPIN MUCH. I also got it in a good condition so yay? Good product so five of five
B0039208JE|5.0|Batman fans who bought the DVD \\"back in the day\\" were probably disappointed with the lack of improvement in picture clarity.  You'll be happy to see the amazing picture quality on blu-ray.  The improvement is so noticable, it feels like you're watching a totally different movie.  In addition, the special features on the DVD were minimal: bios on the actors and director, trailer, and that's about it.  The blu-ray is packed with special features including comentary, cast interviews, music videos and more.<br /><br />Those looking to save a few bucks will be satisfied with this version.  The special edition is pretty much the same thing with just a little booklet added.
B003WTE886|5.0|Fearless, Taylor Swift's sophomore album, was a rarity. Selling millions upon millions of copies, it was also met with critical acclaim, earning her the Grammy for Album of the Year. It was well-deserved: Fearless stands as a diary of a young woman, a coming of age unlike any that has been penned within the realm of country music. Each song felt organic, growing and coming to fruition perfectly alongside the others. So what does an artist do when they've created the perfect portrayal of a teenage girl exiting her high school years? If you're Taylor Swift, you create a masterpiece of a woman coming to terms with the world around her.  Speak Now traps individual experiences perfectly in song form, synthesizing experiences in a way that can be applied to anyone that's ever lived, yet still be deeply personal. Nary a co-writer can be found on the album, which lends itself even greater to the experience. Speak Now works as well as Fearless did as a whole, but each track is so dense that the album is best reviewed in a track-by-track manner.  Mine: As the lead single, Mine does the perfect job of showcasing the development in Taylor's songwriting. While it seems like a contemporary rehash of Love Story, the lyrics are crafted more masterfully, lending to an altogether more tangible listening experience. Taylor's vocals have also improved, noted in the elongated 'mine' that stretches after the bridge.  Take-away lyric: 'You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter'  Sparks Fly: This song has spent the longest time in work, and several of the lyric couplets prove as much. The sound is turned into more of a pop-rock track rather than a country one, soaring on the opening guitar line and exploding on the bridge. This song has the most potential to be considered a 'throwback' to Taylor's earlier songwriting, feeling younger and more naive and innocent than anything else on the record.  Take-away lyric: 'The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm, and I'm a house ofcards'  Back to December: A powerful ballad, the stage is set within the opening instrumentation, chilling the air and yet warming the soul with melancholy. The triplet structure of the chorus suits the conviction of Taylor's vocal delivery, granting the song an urgency that its tempo wouldn't betray. At nearly five minutes, Back to December marks a trend in lengthier song structure for Taylor.  Take-away lyric: 'I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't. So if the chain is on your door, I understand.'  Speak Now: The title track is coyly infectious and immediately arresting, painting a portrait of a wedding gone awry masterfully. The light as air production paired with the hitches in Taylor's vocal delivery reveal that there's more to singing than pure belting ability, and the rapid fire bridge barrels the song on like a freight train.   Take-away lyric: 'I am not the kind of girl who should be barging in on a white veil occasion, but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl.'  Dear John: A power ballad if there ever was one, Dear John nearly hits seven minutes. In that time, it builds slowly with wobbling guitar and tortured words, so glacial that when the bridge erupts and Taylor wails with more skill than she was once ever capable of, the many layers have been snuck in. Every bit of the song feels like a work of art rather than a simple tune, and at its length, that's an incredibly accomplishment.  Take-away lyric: 'But I took your matches before fire could catch me, so don't look now; I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town.'  Mean: The sole outright country song on the album, Mean is deceptively catchy and sly in its wit. Not feeling quite as massive as its predecessor, it instead falls back on fiddles and a strong hook, Taylor's delivery serving up a bite that she hasn't quite let out before.  Take-away lyric: 'Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things; drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing. Butall you are is mean.'  The Story of Us: This song builds itself around sturdy guitars, driving forward the way a good power pop song does. This instead feels much less disposable, with hasty lyrics sung over a more hopeless atmosphere, anonymous profiles meandering about. Taylor's delivery is skilled in its desperation on several of the lyrics here, channeling vulnerability in a way that only someone who has experienced the circumstances first hand could recall.  Take-away lyric: 'I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how; I've never heard silence quite this loud.'  Never Grow Up: Twinkling in on a tragic rhythm, Never Grow Up feels intensely personal, yet universally relevant. Taylor softly recounts memories from second-person, cautioning youth with the experiences still lingering fresh in her mind. This song doesn't swell or build, but there's no need for it. Rather, it's a maelstrom of emotions that settle like debris after a hurricane.  Take-away lyric: 'Remember the footsteps, remember the words said, and your little brother's favorite songs. I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone.'  Enchanted: From the steady introduction to the swelling chorus that ignites into a stadium-filling anthem, Enchanted is the very core of the album. Taylor's delivery shifts from awestruck to desperate to impassioned, all within the span of nearly six minutes. The two-part chorus, the pleading bridge, and the feathery ending complete what is the masterpiece of Taylor's career.  Take-away lyric: 'The lingering question kept me up; two a.m. who do you love? I wonder 'til I'm wide awake.'  Better Than Revenge: Opening with a spoken command and followed by aggressive drums, Better Than Revenge is an all-claws battle from a woman scorned. It's the most rock-oriented song Taylor's ever done, and she takes control with the rage warranted. The tone doesn't shift throughout the song, relentless in its delivery until it all comes to a perfectly orchestrated, immediateconclusion.  Take-away lyric: 'Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys on the playground won't make you many friends.'  Innocent: Playing the roll of forgiver, Taylor delivers quiet verses while offering solace in a chorus that swells on its second take, the entire song feeling like thousands of candles in the wind on a cool fall night. The message is the centerpiece of the song, and it is driven home with expertise.  Take-away lyric: 'Wasn't it easier, run wild 'til you fell asleep, before the monsters caught up to you?'  Haunted: An orchestra of stringed instruments compliment the band on Haunted, a bleak song of desperation and anger. Taylor cries out in abandonment, infecting each lyric of the chorus with equal parts aggression and heartache. The bridge draws it all back until the final line, which ignites the embers into a wildfire within the cold forest that the song brings to mind.  Take-away lyric: 'You and I walk a fragile line; I have known it all this time, but I never thought I'd live to see it break.'  Last Kiss: In the vein of the stripped back Never Grow Up, this song is saturated in pain and regret rather than childhood memories, detailing a relationship that took a piece of Taylor with its conclusion. The inhalation of breath right before the final chorus, paired with the whispered, broken delivery give the song a lonely, tragically beautiful sound.  Take-away lyric: 'You can plan for a change in weather and time; I never planned on you changing your mind.'  Long Live: A powerful arena song that draws the album to a close, Long Live feels very much like a content ending to a world of memories, both good and bad. The guitars open up and the band comes alive as Taylor sings with all the passion she can muster, as though throwing a fist in the air in triumph. You have a right to, Taylor. You have created a true masterpiece.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I have an iPad 2.<br /><br />The USB connector worked great directly from Nikon D5000 Camera. The photos popped up excellent!<br /><br />I placed a formatted SD card into my MAC and dragged some jpg images onto the 2GB SD Card. After safe ejection, I placed the SD Card into the SD Card iPad device....... Nothing happened..... didn't work!<br /><br />So, I did some further research and found the answer.<br /><br />On a camera, it creates a folder called DCIM. All the images are placed into it when you're taking photos.<br /><br />ANSWER: I erased my SD Card, Created a DCIM Folder on it, dragged my jpg images from my MAC onto the SD CARD, loaded the SD CARD into my Apple SD Device then into the iPad 2........

B001UV4XIS|3.0|As a hardcore Harry Potter fan I was really disappointed in this final installment in the movie series. Strangely enough, as I was reading the second half of the book when it first came out I thought it would be the easiest to translate to film. Boy was I wrong. the story feels rushed, pushed in the background of big visuals and unneeded random bits of 3D. Harry Potter was never a story about flashes and bangs but a story about a boy finding his place. That was lost in this film. If you like to watch movies to see things get blown up then this is the movie for you! If you like to watch movies for rich storytelling, then you'd probably be better off reading the book. I gave this movie three stars because while the story was lacking in comparison to the book, the visuals, when not in the god awful 3D were stunning. Also the Princes Tale was very well done.
B005DZMODI|1.0|Well, Clapton has hit a new low.  His guitar playing has been remarkably predictable for some time now and so it's no surprise that he doesn't surprise on here.  Trust me, you've heard every lick he plays on this album from him at least a few hundred times by now.  His singing is an abomination.  I don't know if he was purposely trying to sound like Louis Armstrong in order to display some \\"New Orleans cred\\" but his vocals are awful.  The arrangements are, for the most part, further abominations.  Not only does Layla get slaughtered, as one might expect in a \\"dixieland jazz band format.\\"  NOTE:  This is NOT a blues album unless you count the fact that early New Orleans jazz was in the i, iv, v, 12-bar blues format. But even traditional tunes such as \\"Joe Turner\\" get turned into unrecognizable dirges.  AND, if all of this wasn't bad enough the quality of the recording is horrible.  All the engineers, producers, etc. should be banned from ever working on another album of any kind for releasing this travesty.  Marsalis is, however, his usual masterful self.
B005WGBQ9G|3.0|As with all fans of this show I have been looking for this second season with a lot of excitement. The season premiere last year was awesome and created a massive fan base. However, the rest of the season was good but settled into a regular level of entertainment for the show. I was seriously excpecting this premeire to be as intense and entertainging as the last but was a little disappointed. It felt like a regular episode, which is not really bad. I was just really looking forward to something more. Anyway, having said that, there are some parts to this that I feel was simply writers out of their element.   First, they seem to be falling into the trap that doomed the latest incarnation from the Stargate franchise \\"Stargate: Universe\\" by having secrets, problems, plot lines, and solutions to happen at a snails pace! I mean, really! Settle some of these things and move on! It should not take two seasons for Rick to find out that his wife had a relationship with his best friend! My humble advice: keep it moving and keep the story arcs simple and a little shorter.  Second, having been raised in the south and around a few baptist churches, I found it funny that they choose to place the \\"spiritual confrontation\\" of the group in what the sign called a \\"Southern Baptist Church\\" all decked out with a massive life sized crucifix! Maybe I'm the only person who laughed at that, but all the baptist churches I have ever seen never had any obviously catholic icons in them. Anyway, I did not care, it just shouted to me of writers who are out of their element when writing about southern religious imagery. Does anyone ever do research anymore?  Nevertheless, the show is awesome and I'm sure that it will be a good season. But frankly, after a long period of time to get ready for season two, you would have expected a little more fireworks!
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Since Cream and even before (in 1965 with John Mayall Clapton recorded his first vocal on Johnson's Rambling On My Mind) Eric Clapton has made a fortune playing Robert Johnson songs, but on this album he clearly demonstrates that either he forgot everything he ever knew about Johnson's music, or he never actually knew that much to begin with.<br /><br />Covering any Johnson tune is no easy task, for Johnson was idiosyncratic and a musical genius:  he displayed his emotions not on his shirtsleeve but through his guitar strings - they were all right out there to see, sometimes painfully so.  Therefore only a very few guitarists (Rory Block perhaps being the best example) try to play Johnson \\"like\\" Johnson.  Clapton can be forgiven, therefore, for trying to put his own spin on these songs, but basically his spin is so far off kilter that the album is a disaster.<br /><br />For some reason he takes songs that have grave emotional depths and gives them an uptempo shuffle groove.  The two most prominent examples are \\"Love in Vain\\" and \\"Come On In My Kitchen.\\"  \\"Love In Vain\\" is about just that - \\"deep\\" blues.  How Clapton can justify putting a shuffle beat to a lyric like \\"When the train rolled in the station, and I looked her in the eye // Well I was so lonesome, I felt so lonesome, and I could not help but cry,\\" is unimaginable.  He treats \\"Come On In My Kitchen,\\" a song so poigniant that Johnny Shines frequently said it could make grown men cry, the same way.  I'm not sure if there's such a thing as the \\"blues police\\" but there should be such a force established just to prevent such abominations from taking place.<br /><br />\\"Last Fair Deal Gone Down,\\" actually a work song that Johnson probably learned from Ike Zimmerman (his main guitar mentor who was a highway construction worker on Highway 51) also gets turned into a honky tonk jive piece that strains its A, A, A, B lyric format (an ancestor of the blues' A.A,B form).<br /><br />Perhaps most tragic is what Clapton does to Johnson's masterpiece \\"Hellhound On My Trail.\\"  The most haunting lyrics perhaps in all the blues, eerily playing off Skip James' \\"Devil Got My Woman\\" in open Em tuning, gets turned into a heavy rocker with Clapton shouting the lyrics rather than trying to feel any of the emption of Johnson's original.<br /><br />This is simply a mess and a disservice to Johnson, his music, and all the millions upon millions of dollars Clapton has made off his tunes.  Avoid at all costs.hound On My Trail.\\"  The most haunting lyrics perhaps in all the blues, eerily playing off Skip James' \\"Devil Got My Woman\\" in open Em tuning, gets turned into a heavy rocker with Clapton shouting the lyrics rather than trying to feel any of the emption of Johnson's original.

B004EPZ07U|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good start for a Green Lantern series of films. Lets hit on the good first.<br />1. If you followed the comics, there's so much foreshadowing in this movie of things to come. I felt it set up sequels very well.<br />2. We all know Sinestro will eventually use the Yellow ring (Powered by fear) becoming one of the corps greatest foes.<br />3. Hal will eventually become Parallax (He's possessed by Parallax), dies and returns as the Spectre.<br />4. Introduction of other Human GL's will make for good sequels. It would be cool for them to do a Justice League movie as well.<br />5. The CG SFX in this film were pretty good. They mixed up his constructs enough that we didn't see him doing the same thing over and over.<br />The bad:<br />1. I agree with other reviews that said it should have been longer in order to build the characters or the GL's. I didn't feel there was enough interaction with the corps.<br />DVD packaging quality:<br />Not happy that the reg DVD is the movie only and has absolutely zero extras. That's what the digital copy is for. Only the BluRay disc has special features.<br />It was a good movie with some very minor flaws. Worth the watch and purchase.

B005BOUY38|5.0|I have been anxiously, with baited breath, awaiting this album and praying that it wouldn't...you know...suck...like so many other talented artists' albums do after the first 2 or 3 come out.  I WAS NOT disappointed with this at all...he's still soulful, spirited and freakishly talented. Listening to his voice is like slipping a piece of dark chocolate onto your tongue and letting it melt slowly.  My favorite tunes so far are \\"I Won't Let You Go\\", \\"Up\\", and \\"Slave to the Music\\" but I will have to give this MANY more listens to find all the other gems that are sure to exist on this album.

This book really lays it out in a clear-cut manner exactly what the benefits of exercise are. After reading it, every day you skip exercising you'll know exactly what you're missing out on.  The only \\"downside\\" to this book is that it's occasionally very technical and has many scientific words. That said, it's still quite easy to understand.
B001F6TXME|4.0|A very nice controller for my Nikon D90. Works as expected but the button seems a bit soft, not enough feedback, for me.

Would I purchase this item again... yes I would :)
B004EPZ09S|4.0|Contagion might be described as a \\"cinematic documentary\\" (oxymoronic, I know) that realistically imagines what might happen if a new, initially unstoppable virus sprang up and killed people on a global scale. The movie doesn't actually sound particularly unique from the outset, with quotes like \\"it's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out\\", but when you think about it, most epidemic-themed films are completely fictional, while Contagion tries to paint a picture of what might really happen.<br /><br />The story mostly centers around Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) who is immune to the disease and must protect his daughter from society's collapse, Alan Krumwiede the amateur freelance journalist with a conspiratorial mind, and Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard), an epidemiologist sent to Hong Kong to find the origin of the disease.<br /><br />Most of the performances are solid and make you believe that what is happening in the movie is possible, as they react realistically to it. Cheever has to deal with the accusation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is overreacting to the virus and he is also harassed by Krumwiede. He's an intelligent and affable person, be he makes some bad mistakes.<br /><br />I feared that the filmmakers might be trying to hard to give a \\"normal\\" perspective on things by including Matt Damon's character, but fortunately he sold the idea of a normal dad who has to become a desperate survivor in a dire time. Through him we can see a lot of how the contagion has a affected the masses, civilization committing suicide, if you will.<br /><br />The other two protagonists are the weakest. I like Jude Law, but his character is a cardboard \\"villain\\" who gets more and more inhuman as the film progresses. Marion Cotillard's story line is useless (sans the scenes that show us how the disease spreads) and disappears for most of the film, before returning with zero resolution. You must sit through these parts of the movie wondering what the point is.<br /><br />As the global situation worsens, people start rioting and looting and the like, and cities are quarantined. I felt like one or two sections where people started rioting were a bit abrupt, like there needed to be more build-up to show the insecurity of the populace, and then showing them finally snap and begin with the killing and destroying. But overall it's believable, and there are many sequences that portray the utterly ruined city littered with the dead. There is something intense about parts of this film, the cinematography and music combined with the believable premise and shots of the damage done. It constantly made me think to myself \\"What if this happened? What would we do? What would I do?\\"<br /><br />As great as it is, Contagion suddenly ends without ever coming to a point of absolute tension. The audience is suddenly sees how the contagion came about, though the characters are never shown to have learned this themselves. I could have used some more resolution to these character, who I had grown to care about, and perhaps to re-cooperation of the world. But Contagion just ends. It's great while it lasts though. It want to give it a 9, but it falls just short.<br />8 out of 9ning with zero resolution. You must sit through these parts of the movie wondering what the point is.

Errol Flynn provides a lively performance as Robin Hood, and the colour quality of the footage and costumes is excellent considering the year of its production.

Its energy is good which makes it highly satisfactory for viewers of all ages.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

1589949811|3.0|The game is enjoyable. I bought 2 core sets, so that I could play along with 3 friends. The rules are a little complex, but my group prefers it that way. Much of my fun has come in learning to more efficiently use our skills and abilities on strengthening fellow players, rather than \\"self-buffing\\". Also, playing with all 4 spheres/players made for an easier and much more fun game. I haven't solo'd the game yet, just didn't seem fun for me. We also haven't experimented with breaking the different spheres down and building custom decks.<br /><br />Here are some points about the game that have their positive, or negative spin depending on your preference:<br /><br />*Cooperative Game (Can get boring pretty quick. Yes there is \\"scoring\\" for survivors, but there is no real competition among players during the game. If you and friends like fully co-op games, you'll probably like this one).<br /><br />*Up to 4 players (1 core set will support 2 players, another core set will allow 4 of you to play. The publisher, Fantasy Flight Games(FFG), could have spent just a little more money and made it up to 4 players per core set, but they didn't. I consider that \\"poor form\\" on their part).<br /><br />*Complex rules set (Takes some time to learn and work the kinks out. This is common for games published by FFG. You should know this before you buy it).<br /><br />*Fellowship Oriented (The only role for you and your friends to fill are that of the \\"good guys\\". No one can play Sauron, or any of his evil forces... which goes back to the game being fully cooperative).<br /><br />*Low Replayability (The game comes with 3 quests. They are easily finished and you are left wanting more. The game was purposefully designed like that. FFG uses a \\"living card game\\" model, where they start with a \\"core set\\" and then publish additional expansions (about $12-$15) every few months to add to your collection. Sure, you don't NEED these expansions, but a game like Lord of the Rings:Card Game quickly becomes boring. After owning the game for a few weeks, I've already ordered a couple more expansion packs to keep our gaming sessions going. They got me this time. The only question, now, is for how much?)<br /><br />*Deck Building (Our group hasn't experimented this far, yet. Supposedly, you can separate the cards in each sphere and build your own custom deck with hero's, ally's, attachments and events from the different spheres. There are requirements/restraints, of course, and I can see how this would be fun during the game. The deck building part, where I'd be agonizing over what components would go into my deck... it just doesn't seem fun for me. I imagine, however, that a Magic: The Gathering player would almost insist on being able to build their own deck.)<br /><br />Overall, my experience has been positive with this game.lready ordered a couple more expansion packs to keep our gaming sessions going.

I really like the direction Machine Head went with this album it sounds a lot better than any previous album insofar as production quality/mixing is concerned.  I Am Hell (Sonata in C#), Be Still and Know, Locust, This is the End, and Darkness Within are my favorites from this album.  In short, I recommend this album to old fans and especially to people who like thrash metal bands like Metallica and MegaDeth.  It's definitely one of the best Metal albums of 2011 and I think Machine Head's personal best.

My 17 year old is currently reading it, and I'll pass it along to my 21 year old when he's finished with it. So far, my 17 year old loves the book also.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Sometimes the conception of art can be everything. Every artist approaches the subject in a unique way, and there is never a right or wrong option. Some alternatives, however, can lead to self-destructive behaviors (consequently, the image of the tormented artist has been tremendously popular in the past).<br /><br />Darren Aranofsky's latest film deals with art and the delicate balance between Eros and Thanatos. As Sigmund Freud wrote in some of his books, the vital drive and the death drive are forces that coexist in each one of us. Nina, the protagonist, though, finds out that sometimes it's nearly impossible to regain a sense of selfness after such different and opposite forces menace to pull her apart.<br /><br />Nina has a deep devotion for ballet. Her whole emotional stability seems to depend on being selected for the main role for the upcoming ballet production. She is a superb ballerina but her director constantly criticizes her for being too rigid, too cold, too passionless. What lies underneath her unruffled expression? What's beneath all that control and perfection of movement? Only neurosis, I'd dare to claim.<br /><br />If life and death are the most relevant aspects as some philosophers might affirm, then one could easily find a connection between sexual impulses and the vital drive. But what would occur when the pulse of nature is denied? What happens when sexual activity is not only disregarded but put off altogether? Freud did a thorough analysis of his time and he reached one daunting conclusion, which was quite polemic back then: sexual repression always leads to neurosis.<br /><br />Nina's director can easily spot the uptightness of the future star. She is not only tense, she is afraid of her own body, of her own sexuality. Perhaps one could identify Nina's mother as the source of all evils. It has been said before that it's so easy to blame everything on the parents that one should look for other possibilities. This case, however, proves that parental influence can be most detrimental. With a mother that watches over her daughter constantly, controlling her and treating her like a child, it's only foreseeable to understand how this will affect Nina.<br /><br />When Nina's mother undresses her or sleeps in the same bedroom, the viewer may be shocked at the lack of privacy, but perhaps what is more shocking is the passive response of the protagonist. It should be understandable, then, to see those repressed feelings surmounting the mental barriers she has put into place; in fact, after certain events Nina will even fantasize about the possibility of engaging in a lesbian affair of most physical nature.<br /><br />There is much suspense throughout the film, and the constant supernatural visions of intrusions of the ominous can take us back, again, to the Freudian unheimlich: quotidian activities or mundane locations are infused with something that might be real but at the same time defies possibility, thus instilling apprehension and anxiety in people. Nina will experience something similar, but in a much more frightful manner. The very first scene sets the tone for these dark and ominous moments.<br /><br />Art is creation, but it can also be destruction. At moments it would look as if Nina won't be able to resist the pressure, and the constant visions she seems to have might be seen as proof of her weak psychological condition. She could crumble at any moment as things heat up. Surrounded by envious ballerinas, sieged by her director, betrayed by the only girl she could call friend, Nina will soon find out that true artistic creation requires absolute passion and commitment to survive the experience. And thus, finally, the viewers come to realize what is the ultimate conception of art in Nina's mind.l.

Vimes is in his element!<br /><br />My joy at getting another City Watch book was tempered as I got further into this book. It's a good book, no doubt about that, but...it didn't feel quite right. I feel almost ashamed to write that because I adore the Discworld books. There weren't any surprises -  I pretty much guessed the entire plot only a few chapters in. Vimes was, dare I say it, irritating at times. At the drop of a hat he'd launch into extended speechifying and after a while I started speed-reading the speeches or skipping them altogether, something I've never before done with a Discworld book.<br /><br />The good parts (and there were many):<br />Sybil Vimes<br />- The woman is a treasure and Sam is a very lucky man to have her. She's brave, resourceful, compassionate, practical, has a wonderful sense of humour and is sexy and confident.<br />Young Sam<br />- Who wouldn't love a kid who is fascinated by poo?<br />The goblins<br />- Pratchett does a wonderful job bringing the goblins and their world to life. There were times when I was close to tears and there were also times I laughed a lot.<br /><br />I would've given this book 4 1/2 stars if not for the rather weak plot, the downturn in the Vimes character and (very disappointingly) a less frightening Patrician.<br /><br />However! A mediocre Discworld book is still better than most other books so...buy this book!
0385736002|2.0|The Alchemyst had a lot of potential, but suffers from quite obviously being the set up to a longer series.  It was frustrating that I read 300+ pages and none of the conflicts were ultimately resolved.  Every time that it looked like we were going to get some answers or some closure, more questions come up and it was just a hair-pulling experience.  In fact, it was so disappointing that, rather than wanting to read the sequel to find out what happens, I am left eeling like the rest of the series won't be rewarding.    Furthermore, though the mythology kitchen sink has the potential to be interesting, stealing a bit of this and a bit of that left the mythology feeling kind of haphazard and shallow.  Scott obviously knows what he's talking about when it comes to myths and legends, but they could have been used to better effect.    Also damning was that the characters felt rather flimsy and tallow.  It was hard to get invested in any of them.  Overall, the effect of the book was one big \\"meh,\\" but I read the whole thing and didn't hate it, hence two stars rather than one.
B00008PX8P|5.0|As everyone knows it has been a very long time since Led Zeppelin has been at the forefront of rock and roll, in fact, an entire generation has passed. For those who have never experienced this incredible and easily,and I mean EASILY, the best hard rock/ blues band of all time, these DVDs capture exactly what they were all about.If you like Led Zep........PURCHASE THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Yes, I know - a preposition is a terrible thing to end a sentence with. Just seemed right. Anyway, I just wanted to add my two cents to the praise for this game: Quite in addition to the wonderful gameplay, the excellent gradient on the increasing challenge from level to level, and the clean, simple graphics - the music here is WONDERFUL. I routinely turn off the music to a game, usually before I start - I'm playing a game to play a game, not to listen to music. This was different - the game truly wouldn't be the same without the music. The developer and the composer are to be congratulated, and thanked, for putting out a game that's truly a work of art. Looking forward to Reflect!
B005H5GEQM|1.0|This review applies to Senna [2010, UK] DVD.  You need to turn English subtitles on in this version as most of the voice over is not in English, and the translation that created these subtitles is so poor as to render them useless.  They read like the translation from Chinese for a cheap electronic device, and are a terrible distraction.  When the voice over is in English, one can see how far off base the subtitles are.  I hope that there is a better subtitled version forthcoming.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I was disappointed.  I didn't follow Formula 1 during Senna's time, but have watched clips of his career and read of him on-line.  The film didn't show me anything that a few hours on You Tube hadn't shown me already. You Tube clips had shown me that he was fast, had an intense rivalry with Alain Prost, etc.  SPOILER? Although the film puts a lot of energy into setting up his fatal accident as the film's climax (e.g., plenty of that motor racing photo journalism cliche, the driver's haunted eyes as seen through the eye port of his helmet), the accident is almost completely unexplored.  The crash is shown a couple of times, a couple of comments are heard, and then the film moves on.
B00133KHCY|5.0|Simply one of the best movies ive ever seen and ive seen thousands. Some really beautiful music. This is just one of those movies that never did well in the theaters and is a box office smash on video. Shashank Redeption was the exact same way. Few movies have a happy story like this one. This is just pure pleasure.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|in answer to all the questions for all those H2 fanatics out there, like me, here we go. universal electively put back some deleted scenes for tv viewing of the film years after its initial release. i was 15 years old at that time and had seen the film in theatres. when i saw the film on tv finally i was shocked to see extra scenes, scenes i did not see in the film. these scenes answered alot of questions that fans frequently ask like \\"WHY WAS THE HOSPITAL SO DARK\\"? alot of these questions will b answered if you get this excellant bluray thru amazon. this sadly is not a directors cut. not included in these deleted scenes section is extra dialogue between \\"mr garrett and karen. As shes walking in late and he buzzes her in he stops her and gives her his own unique perspective on the killings in the neighborhood. and michael got cut himself in a small but poignant  scene not included, when he finds lauries room and walks towards her, scalpel in hand, he starts stabbing away at what he thinks is laurie but she hides the pillows under the covers, we all know that. well before michael walks out of the room he grabs the pillows and violently jerks them across the room then he walks out. its nothing yes but i would of love for that scene to be put back in. I bought this bluray hoping and praying that all this would be put back in the film seeing this is the 30th anniversary issue but such is not the case. all except those two scenes are back in the disks deleted scenes. oh well, the blu ray is still a real TREAT and i recommend it highly. the picture is so much sharper and john carpenter and alan howarths score is soooo extremely powerful in full dts 5.1 master audio. i recommend one really crank it up to get the full effect. that alone is worth the price of this bluray. so many years weve heard it thru just 2.0 dolby surround. it substitutes for no commentary track by director rick rosenthal who went on to do BAD BOYS with sean penn and came back to do HALLOWEEN RESSURECTION with jamie and no featurettes sadly but again oh well. Another surprise is the 1984 feature documentary \\"TERROR IN THE AISLES\\" hosted by sir donald pleasance and nancy allen commentaring and making fun of films in the horror genre. a nifty treat you'll love. stay scared!ON with jamie and no featurettes sadly but again oh well.

0780631684|5.0|I wasn't old enough to see this movie when it first came out but all I could hear people talk about was how awesome \\"Final Destination\\" was! It was amazingly original and creatively twisted! Final Destination was like Sam Rami's Evil Dead.... a first time success! It has made four sequels to this day and I hope there will be more to come!  Plot: After a random plane crash that has left people shocked one of the survivors (A college kid named Alex Browning) has a vision of one of the survivor's deaths and then out of no where the teen he envisioned dies! Now Alex realizes that death has a design and it's not finished and he must find a way to stop it or at least skip the next victim at there final destination!  Review: Wow... this has to be one of the most confusing yet easily understandable plot sequences I have seen since \\"The Butterfly Effect!\\" I bet that it was a nightmare to try and come up with this plot for the writers who help create this masterpiece and I will admit that the idea is a little silly but if you don't take it too seriously you should be fine! The deaths were also very creative and brutal! The soundtrack was killer and the acting was superb this film has a lot to give to the audience and it has some deaths that you just won't see coming!  Acting: Devon Sawa \\"Night of the Twisters (1996)\\", Ali Carter \\"House on Haunted Hill (1999), Final Destination 2 (2003) and Resident Evil Parts 3 & 4 (2007/2010)\\" and Kristen Cloke \\"Black X-Mass (2006)\\" were excellent actors and so were the rest of the cast! The Acting felt real and the actors that died did an amazing job portraying and performing there deaths!  Gore: This is what I meant by the \\"Weak MPAA\\" statement.... it was very brutal and should've had at least strong horror violence in the rating! We get a head sliced in half, bloody stabbings, a girl gets hit by a buss (blood does splatter, but the impact is not completely shown and happens very fast), and we also get a scene with some burnt bodies!  Bottom Line: Clever little flick that doesn't hold back on what it promises and builds up to! It is amazing and was totally new at the time but now it has been repeated so many times with the sequels but I can not say that all the four sequels are bad!   Rated: \\"R\\" for violence and terror, and for language  Suggested MPAA: Rated: \\"R\\" for strong horror violence, terror, language, and thematic material  Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10  For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5

B004LWZW42|4.0|I am a huge X-Men fan, so I bought this movie without having seen it. I was extremely disappointed with Wolverine as it really wasn't that good. But this one was awesome! The actors are great, and special effects are cool. If you are an X-Men fan, it's a must have! If not, it is still a good story.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|That was some powerfully fantastic storytelling!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Story and writing were amazing and challenging.  Story begins a little confusing at first; but the author does a great job of weaving all the seemingly disparate threads together into a beautiful finale without losing the reader along the way.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I recently watched the blu ray and the picture quality is a big improvement over the standard dvd. This movie has alot of dark and night scenes but it looks very very good. I saw very minimal film grain in a few scenes but nothing to worry about. The 5.1 dts sound was also sweet. I've waited a long time for this movie on blu ray and It was worth it.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|As in 80's geek/nerd kid I found the book fun - fun like watching your best friend muddle through the solution script of Zork Enchanter without letting you have a turn.  Story is exciting/adventurous but only up to a point; it reminds me of how all the MUD/MMORG adventure games eventually devolve into tiresome digital scavenger hunts.  I enjoyed the read like a quick and easy Saturday morning cartoon.  The memories evoked were probably a big part of that enjoyment.  If a reader did not experience this particularly peculiar 8-bit culture first-hand, the book may seem like your stuck in the arcade without any quarters.
B005MVJM3I|5.0|I discovered Machine Head about 3 years ago.  I'm probably not the biggest fan they have, but they are one of my favorite bands.  This album is a little more contemplative, and therefore runs a little deeper than the previous.  It also isn't straight rage like some of their other works.  Because of that, people have been saying that it loses it's edge, and isn't as compelling.  I disagree.  While it does seem like it's a tad toned down, it is an extremely solid work.  It is better than 98 percent of everything else I've heard, so I still give it 5 stars.  It's not the same as some of the stuff on the Blackening, but had it been, people would be complaining about that too.  I think it is a solid evolution.  It is defiant, pointed, and still rocks on all levels.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|After seeing Fantastic Mr. Fox in the movies I had to buy it. The stop-motion is great and the casting on the voices is perfect, with great humor for both adults and kids. Its amazing how good this movie is with having such a short story to work with, I would recommend checking it out.
0062103377|5.0|Bobby Singer cannot believe what is happening to him as he suffers from rapid accelerating memory loss. Three days ago he was in Ashland, Wisconsin on a hunting assignment before driving to Sioux Falls.  Somehow he awakes in his home confused with how he got there and struggles with things like opening his tumbler.  Fearing he will lose what is left of his memory, Bobby writes down a guide to hunting so that the dwindling others like Sam and Dean will have something to help them when they are hunting.  This is his legacy if he can remember to write it.<br /><br />He considers calling Rufus, but he is gone.  Bobby thinks back to Ashland where he recalls Sam and Dean were also hunting the Banshee that was terrorizing the Northern Wisconsin town.  They don't answer their zillion cellphones.  Still Bobby remembers the banshee had with it a liquid woman who wanted his head on a platter.  As they took care of the banshee using an iPhone, Bobby next found himself on his couch wondering how he got there and what happened to his memory.  His Chevelle is entangled with another car and on its windshield is written Karen, the wife he loved and lost.<br /><br />This is an entertaining supernatural thriller that uses an intriguing technique to tell the story line and provide insight into the realm.  The key cast mirrors the personalities on a TV show though there is somewhat less camaraderie between the brothers than for instance in John Pasarella's entry Night Terror.  Still fans of the show will appreciate David Reed's unique entry as Bobby tries to learn what happened to him while at the same losing his memories as to whom he is.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The narration style is what made this book so unique and interesting. The narrator is all-knowing and is actually a character in the story that talks to you, the reader. It's old-fashioned to do that, but the author modernizes it by making the narrator Death. Set it WWII, it's a thought-provoking story on the power of words and friendship. Despite the serious subject, it still manages to be funny sometimes. Loved it!
030745455X|2.0|After enjoying the first book in the series \\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\", I couldn't wait to start the second one, \\"The girl who played with fire\\". However, with great expectations come great disappointments. The second book failed to deliver the intense and intriguing storyline that the first one provided. It felt like a regular, average mainstream thriller, that will be probably forgotten a month from now.<br /><br />I won't say much about the main plot, to avoid spoiling the story, but I will touch in one main difference between the books. In the first one we learn about Lisbeth and Mikael and both their characters are well developed, deep and their interactions are very interesting. So basically, the mainstream plot of the first book is wrapped with these two characters, creating a complete novel that grabs the reader from the early pages.<br /><br />However, the second book doesn't do any of those. Lisbeth and Mikael are still the main characters, but their development simply stopped in this book. The development in the plot is done through the revelation of Lisbeth weird and tragic family history (which I don't want to extend the discussion here to not spoil the *twist*), but that's it. Further implications, both emotionally and psychologically are left out undeveloped. In addition, the book describes scenes that are in the border line between Hollywood action scenes and comic books. They are both unbelievable, yet predictable if we were watching a bad action movie.<br /><br />This sums up to a pretty regular thriller that do not shine above the rest, and does not worth the hype! I'm not sure I'll continue to the third book in the series. If you really liked Lisbeth, go ahead and pick it, otherwise, there are better options on the selves/Ipod.
0307450570|5.0|This is a wonderful book, which contains wonderful ideas for decorating and sewing. A must have in every woman's library.
0545259088|4.0|I have been reading Maggie Stiefvater's books for years and the Mercy Falls Trilogy is one of my favorites.  I started reading Shiver to help my sister in law review books before purchasing them for my niece.  I immediately fell in love with the series and the characters, that I continued to purchase the books without being prompted.  In the earlier books, I found some of the characters, especially Sam, a little too emotional and to be frank, slightly annoying (Shiver).  But that said, I think that the progressed character development throughout the series helped make Forever the best of all the books.  All of Sam's emotional issues that was discussed and focused on in the earlier books really came into play and almost closure during the book.    This book focuses more on Sam and Cole then any of the other characters.  I absolutely fell in love with Cole's character the more I kept reading.  His quick wit, comic relief and his relationship with Isabel really helped seal the deal on making this my favorite book of the Trilogy.    That said, I am torn on how I feel about the ending.  Part of me loves that Steifvater left it open for the reader to decide what happens to Sam and Grace but another part of me feels a little let down.  I would love to have known if a cure was discovered, if Grace would get her \\"red coffee maker\\" and be able to participate in all the things in life she has been wanting.    Overall, wonderful book, especially for teens!
0316010669|5.0|Wow. This one is a must read for anyone interested in how people make decisions. Gladwell ties in research from a wide range of fields and disciplines to create a very elaborate map of how we respond to emotional, verbal and physical stimuli.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|This one of the best sci-fi thrillers i have seen in a while, with an ending that totally caught me off guard. I highly recommend this movie. It was also shipped to me in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|On Puscifers first cd, some songs were hit or miss. It was very experimental and didnt sound like it had any clear direction... it was all over the place. Ive been waiting for this disc for some time ever since I heard \\"C is for...\\" and now that ive heard this, wow, im in love. This disc has a dark electronic vibe, like v for vagina, but instead of going off on tangents, it sticks to one really awesome sound. And if you were dissapointed in the lack of guitar on previous releases, you'll be happy to find that this isnt the case this time around. In my opinion, I feel like this is a mixture of maynards other projects plus a dash of Depeche Mode added into the mix. If you were skeptical about Puscifer because of V is for vagina, dont let that discourage you from this, or you'd be missing out. After hearing this, It makes me miss Tool a lot less as well as A Perfect Circle, and happier that he's focusing his energy in this amazing project. And after you hear this, im almost certain you'll feel the same way.
0446585025|1.0|As much as I like Ellen Degeneres and her show, this book was awful.  I feel like I wasted $12.99 to download it on my Kindle. It's page after page of disconnected thoughts from her head.  There is no storyline whatsoever.  I can't even finish it and I'm 90% done.  Kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.
0545323126|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series  Warning! If you don't like hilarious books that make you laugh uncontrollably ,this is not the book for you. Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid series had made #1 New York Times Best Seller for almost all of the books. These books never get boring! I have read each book at least three times.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid is about a boy named Greg Heffley as he goes through middle school,deals with annoying siblings, and everyday struggles. Jeff Kinney makes these things silly,down-to-earth and something you can relate to.  I definitely recommend this book for anyone ages 8 and up. Even my brother likes these books and he hardly reads anything!
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Cons: The headset was muted in the left ear on arrival. Turning the expander switch on would temporarily fix the issue.   Personal preference but the headset became heavy after a while, and was uncomfortable to wear in general. It would also cause pain on my right ear due to the inner cup pushing against the rim of my ear.  Pros: When I could hear out of both sides the sound was decent, and the bass was pretty good
0345529057|5.0|I don't know if the issues people were having from this specific box set of books was when they first were published or what, but I had no trouble at all with any of the 4 books in the set. They are paperback and they are thick books so if you don't handle them properly then I imagine you will have some pages falling out and other damage issues, but I didn't have one page fall out of any of mine and I submitted them to the general level of abuse that a book I take with me everywhere receives. Also, there were not any grievous grammatical errors or typos throughout the whole read.<br /><br />As far as if you should read these books, that answer is a resounding YES! The only reason you should not read these books is if you cannot step outside of the \\"here's your hero and he's going to be the hero throughout the whole story and he's most definitely the good guy\\" box. These books are not like that, but that's one of the things that makes them so great.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|When I read all the negative comments about Star Wars Blu Ray, I passed on pre-ordering it.  But then I read a few good reviews. So I took the plunge and added it to my other DVD versions.  I found the Blu Rays outstanding. Both sound and picture.  To the naysayers, I would note Star Wars is pure entertainment. The Blu Ray may not have every little nuance you couch Movie Directors want. But its still pure entertainment. George Lucas brought us a fantastic story.  Get over the little items you are so opposed to that ruin what should be hours of great enjoyment. Use the force, and if that doesn't work, try prosaic.  In 1977 I saw Star Wars 4 times on the big screen. That experience, although great - can't compare to the Blu Ray version. Same goes for all in the Complete Saga. If you are a Star Wars fan, then this is for you!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|The first DVD I received was scrached, and when they saw my first review they atomatically sent me a replacement!

B0028RXXFC|5.0|What a great show!  This Blu-Ray set is wonderful, the colors and the quality are superb.  The packaging of the collection is nice, its like a book complete with a cloth-like bookmark to help you remember what disc you are on.  Im never buying another DVD again.  GREAT!
B005KXT58U|4.0|I loved the first two albums and was really looking forward to this one -- and I'm a little disappointed.  There are some very enjoyable songs on this new album and all twelve are good, but I'm still searching for a song that really captivates me.  The best song by far is track 12, Swimming Home, though this song is very soft and light, Amy's vocals on there are unbelievable.  I also like tracks 4, 6, and 11 a lot.  Track 9 has the best lyrics.  Track 7 is an old fashion rock ballad -- but Amy's singing is beautiful as usual.  The rest of the album kind of runs together for me, so I'm still working on it -- maybe it will grow on me with more listening.  But there's a lot missing in this album that I loved from the first two.  There are no big choir sounds, no classical instrumentals.  The subject matter doesn't have the grandeur and power of some of the lyrics from the last album.  There's no Mozart (that I can tell) in it.  No Lacrymosa.  The style is very rock-centric, with very little of the funky gospel-like qualities that were part of songs like \\"your star\\" from the last album.  I guess I just really loved the Open Door and was hoping for more of that.  Sorry to be so negative.  I love Evanescence.  Keep making music, I'll keep listening.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Terry Pratchett writes about the not-so-mythical Discworld, where the politicians and social systems bear an uncanny and sharp-edged resemblance to those we see in our daily news.  I've loved every book in this series and \\"Snuff,\\" is no exception. In \\"Snuff,\\" Commander Vines is forced by Lord Vetinari and Vine's wife to go on vacation to the family estate in the countryside. As always nothing Vetinari does is without a hidden purpose, so while Vines relaxes with his wife and son, a sinister plot unfolds in the background. The relationship between Commander Vines and his wife, Lady Sylvia (she who must be obeyed) is wonderfully portrayed.  The lesser characters have depth and charm, and the settings are innovative and intriguing. Vines' young son, Sam, at six years old undertakes a scientific study of Poo, and lovingly interacts with everyone he meets, whatever their species. The stars of this book are the goblins, smelly, unsightly, and unloved creatures. Pratchett brings out their humanity,  thus showing us our own lack of humanity when it comes to \\"lesser\\" creatures. One of the best scenes in the book portrays Vines and Lady Sylvia listening to a brilliant and moving Harp symphony played by a young goblin girl. This is a beautifully written and truly worthwhile book. The errors in the Kindle version pointed out by earlier readers seem to have been fixed. Highly recommended.
B004EPZ084|1.0|Don't know why this movie is getting any 5 stars. I thought it was stupid and not well written. Jennifer Aniston does not make a good slut (tires to hard)she does not fit the part. Kevin Spacey does not strike me as a tough boss. Charlie Day is just annoying-had to mute it a few time because of the complaining.  All in all for a comedy I say no. No comparison to the Hangover.  Every time you put a lot of known actors in a movie it usually sucks. Perfect example \\"Valentines Day\\" another \\"you got to be kidding movie.
B00000E7Q6|4.0|Lately I've taken to exploring Bowie's newer works, since I haven't really listened to any of it. I stopped listening to him sometime back around the mid to late 80s. I like this album. It takes you all sorts of places that only he can. I like the maturity of it. Its sort of like going to a modern high class club and he is the band leader. It works.
B005636EA6|4.0|They sound like a mix of Daft Punk and Deadmau5 musically and kind of remind me of Digital Underground with the vocals.  Nothing groundbreaking, but plenty for party rocking.
1416550550|3.0|A good book, but with many flaws, and NOT for readers who are interested in smart historical fiction.  Based on all the 5-star reviews, I was expecting a much better book.  Pros & Cons:  Pros:  1.  Generally, the book is well-written and very easy to read.  If you want to be challenged, this one is NOT for you).  Ms. Morton's writing has good flow and is quite nicely descriptive. 2.  The main theme of this book is mother-child relations.  The author does a great job with this theme that is so important in life but seldom written about in fiction.  My guess is that's why it got so many 5-star reviews.  3.  Some quite nice ideas:  the forgotten garden (well done), the inclusion of the fairy tales (nice, but I wish the author would have done more with this), and different locations (Australia, England).  Cons:  1.  The constant POV (Point of View) jumping that occurs throughout the book, especially in the first half, gets exhausting and interferes with the reader's ability to identify with the characters.  The author has at least 5 POVs (all of the major female characters).  I put the book down several times and almost didn't go back to it because this got to be so annoying.  2.  Character development is weak and made worse by the POV shifting.  If you picked up the book, picked a page at random and started reading, you would have no idea which character was telling the story.  3.  Male characters are not developed at all.  4. THE MOST DISAPPOINTING aspect of the book for me is that is main plot is SO OBVIOUS, but I had to read several hundred pages to confirm that I was right about it.  It's very frustrating waiting for the main characters to \\"catch up.\\"  5.  In historical fiction, I like to learn something.  Didn't learn much from this one.  6.  THIS BOOK IS SO LONG, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PLOT.  At least 300 hundred pages could have easily been edited out.  One suspects the publishers left it overlong so they could charge more for it.  BOTTOM LINE:If you like overly long sentimental books that are a lot like soap operas, then this one's for you.  If you're looking for a intelligent historical novel, then skip it.  I'm glad I got this one from the library.
B00014NE62|5.0|This movie is interesting in that it depicts a theme in the edwardian period.  The exploration of this particular theme in that time period is educational.

But here are my peeves and won't be recommending to any teens:  1. The rule changes in the middle and end of the games. totally contrived.  2. The meanderings of the characters within the arena with total confusion of layouts or whereabouts. Four times Katniss circled back to the same spot by the stream. The timing and distance totally blurred to the point of boredom. Pacing was poor here.  3. the constant obsessive references to food and preparations of food. I get it already because it's the 'Hunger games' but they do not help build the story, plot or characters. Wasted pages.  4. characters were killed off too conveniently: Rue, Fox-Face, Thresh without regards or story. I thought this was lazy plotting. Why have 24 characters if you only want to tell of 6 (Katniss, Peeta, Rue, Thresh, Foxfaxe and Cato). Maybe it's to do with a YA book and the editors forced cuts in gore. But plot is important and so is the description. Author should have gone all out in creativity (take JK Rowling) and not hold back because it's for teens. That's a disservice to the genre and smack of commercialization. Please stop this.  5. were the parts that katniss was frequently naked in front of Cinna just to titulate the male audience? She's 16, that's creepy!  6. The telling in the present tense through only katniss's eyes totally limited the creativity. Would have loved to experience Peeta's, Rue's and other characters. Wasted.  7. The idea that the 12 tribes of about 8000 people each can sustain a capitol of that grandeur is totally unrealistic from all perpectives bearing resources are scarce. 100K is like a small US town supporting NYC.  8. Ages 12-18 thrown in the gladiatorial arena against each other is unfair, unjust, inhuman, babaric and brutally unneccessary. It's totally contrived because that happens to be the reading age these booksare targeted to.  9. The horrors of the totalitarian regime and the killings are not properly explored as would be required given the premise of the story.  Some how I think the movie might be better because while the idea here is good (even that I heard was taken from somewhere else), the execution (no pun intended) was mediocre to poor.   Parents: Teens should not be exposed to these manipulative ideas and imageries unless you intend to conduct a thorough examination afterwards.
B005GVA2L0|3.0|It actually pains me to write this, but this album was decent at best. When I first heard, \\"What You Want,\\" I was somewhat excited to hear new sound and the song had a good flow. I was very excited about this CD, I've waited years for it and they have been my favorite band since Origin (their best CD to date). The Fallen was a great CD (although not nearly as amazing as others on here claim it to be), The Open Door was amazing but it took a little time to get use to, and this CD is...mediocre. Made of Stone, Lost in Paradise, and Swimming Home are the only three songs that my husband and I can get into. The rest of the songs all start to sound alike and therefore, gets boring to listen to. It's not that the instrumentals are not good, because they are actually great and so are the lyrics. However, the flow of the lyrics with the instrumentals is horrible and it sounds like she's singing along to the wrong set. The bonus tracks are about the same as the rest of the CD, The Secret Door being the best out of them. I love Amy and have been a long time supporter of her and the band, but I will not praise something just because it's Evanescence.   I hope Evanescence will write another CD because I look forward to it, I just hope it's better put together next time.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Love it, Love it, Love it! I am so pleased with this cd. It is everything I had hoped it would be and more. Great songs and Great voice. I would recommend this cd to any country music or Scotty fan. I feel like the song selection was wonderful and I could see each one becoming a hit song for Scotty. He is so talented with his music and I wish him much success. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
8862511124|5.0|Just home from seeing the movie DRIVE based on the book of the same name by James Sallis.    I enjoyed the book, and also the movie!  Howard hadn't read book, but enjoyed the film.  As Jim told me - Hollywood added more violence to the film that he wrote in his very good book.   This has had very good views and came out while we were gone.  Can see why the director got the best director award at the Cann (sp?) Film Festival this year.  The photography, music and everything was very well done and went with the story!
0385738773|5.0|Really enjoyed the last book. Full of action, suspencse, and fun. You will not be disapointed with it. It wraps of everything with great taste.
B005HS00NW|5.0|I've been listening to M83 for years now and this is their opus.  A monumental achievement for Anthony Gonzalez and team.  Beautiful ambient and electronic sound-scapes and guitar driven synth-pop done to perfection.  Really quite an amazing album.  Enjoy it.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Tower Raiders beats this out but not by much. The maps are very challenging (though beatable), tower types are interesting and complementary of each other. Optimal placement and upgrading are key.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Ok seriously, I'm 45 and even I have had fun with it. Will I use it all the time? Maybe not. Kind of neat as a note taker since you can take a photo of the screen. I know there are other apps for that but none as colorful :) And I can definitely see the potential to keep a little one busy for a while.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Great game with multiple solutions for each puzzle. Their website says that they are now working on an expansion pack with new elements.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all three books in less then a week I couldn't put them down. This book was a little slower going at the beginning then the other two but once it picked up I had to find out what happened. I had read several reviews before reading these books and was a little apprehensive about Mockingjay but I must say I was very happy and even cried at the end of this book. While reading this book it really made me think about how war effects the soldiers, the loved ones waiting for them at home and also the ones whose lives and homes are being destroyed due to the fighting. I feel that this book gave me somewhat of a better understanding of how our troops are permanently changed when they return from the war and how some of them have a difficult time returning home and expected to just get back into the swing of things. I have a lot more respect for the men and women who fight for our country and our freedoms. Ms. Collins is a phenominal writer and I cannot wait until my daughters are old enough to understand these books so that I may read them again with them.
B0034G4P80|1.0|Oh, how I loathed this incarnation of Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's immortal Marvel hero. I have been a huge fan and collector of \\"The Mighty Thor\\" for many years. Being as such, I longed for the time that special effects would finally bring the odinson to life on the big screen. Anyway, here's my personal feelings towards a film that could have been a thousand times better than the tripe they gave us. Here we go..  1) \\"THE ICONIC BATTLE HELMET\\". We're teased with it for less than a minute ~ on screen ~ then it simply vanishes, never to be seen or heard from again. Many don't really seem to care. Many still simple accept any bones tossed them. I, on the other hand, \\"SAY THEE NAY\\"! Thor without that iconic helmet is like Superman without his cape, Batman without his ears, or Captain America without his mask. (*I'll save that last comparison for another review*)  Anyway, that really ticked me off. Yet amother example of the directer being ashamed of the source material. It's a glaring fact, especially as a long-time fan ~ that continues to irritate me to no end.  2) Loki is \\"THE GOD OF EVIL\\". What he \\"IS NOT\\" is a misunderstood villian (*alla Raimi's Doc Ock or Sandman*) who turns bad through contrived circumstances. Sometimes a villian should simply be born a villian. Loki and Thor have \\"NEVER\\" been anything but enemies. \\"PERIOD\\"!  3) Heimdel has always been a second banana in the books. Now all of a sudden he's as mighty as Odin himself??? Please. In addition to that, Heimdal's a Caucasian character in the books; not an African. However, what really bothered me with this one was the obvious. Now that they changed Heimdal to a black character, he also had to be at least as powerful as Odin. I found it rascially insecure and contrived. No one is as powerful as Odin in Asgard.   4) I really wanted to see the transformation of Don Blake into Thor. I realize that Don Blake's been out of the comics for some time, but it would have been daring and a sight to see, adding so muchmore to the storyline. But oh yes, the filmmakers continue to be one dimensional thenmselves.  5) Lady Siff and Thor are lovers in the books. In the film there was nothing. Having a love triangle with mortal Jane Foster and goddess; The Lady Siff would have been very intriguing, and again, added more to the story.  6) Volstagg is one of my personal favorites in the comics. A great comedy relief and fun to watch. In the film he was \\"BORING\\"!  7) Has anyone seen or heard from \\"BALDER THE BRAVE\\"?? He's only Thor's best friend and right-hand man. Alas, thanks to the people behind the Thor movie it's \\"where's Waldo\\" all over again.  8) Lastly, the 3D sucked big time.    Anyway, I'm sure to receive tons of hate mail on my review, but really don't care. The film sucked and I'm sorry I went to see it.  P.S. Almost forgot. \\"Hogun The Grimm\\" simply was not him.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This is a great product. Am able to watch items on my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 while charging the device. Can watch movies and such in HD on both devices. A must by if you are on the fence.
0446585025|1.0|Like many who have reviewed Seriously...I'm Kidding, we are fans of Ellen. She is funny and endearing on her show...but this book is poorly written and not funny. Writing humor is not easy...but she is a comedian...and she falls short over and over again. Beyond the humor, she writes in circles--and nothing is particularly interesting.   Contrast that with \\"My Point...and I do Have One\\" that came out in 1996...now THAT was funny. Hilarious, laugh out loud...if you want to read a book written by Ellen, pick that.
B004I11VZA|4.0|I received the blue ray dvd on time.  There were no issues in Australia as our blue ray could read this edition.  The price and quality was fantastic.  Movie itself was good, although not up to the same standard as Ip Man 1.  Definitely worth watching though.
0688172377|2.0|I had read Infidel by Aayan Hirsi Ali and loved it so thought this would be similarly interesting.  But whereas INFIDEL is well written and thought provoking, Desert Flower is shallow and poorly written and as others have mentioned the author seems to be quite self satisfied once she becomes glamorous in America.  The two books tell a similar story but Hirsi Ali learns so much from her experience and shares with us her intellectual and emotional growth as she becomes disenchanted with Muslim fundamentalism after having tried to embrace it, whereas Waris Dirie just doesn't have as interesting a mind or at least doesn't express it.  I was very very disappointed.  If you read this and liked or didn't like it, I suggest you try INFIDEL, a vastly superior book on the same topic.
B000I5X81A|5.0|This is a flawless album from the production, arrangements, and musicianship and song selection. Cale and Clapton work seamless together. I cannot recommend this album higher.
B002G7N6TC|5.0|I recently purchased this book as a gift for my friend who has a 4 month old son. It is the only book that settles him down when he fusses. He loves it!
B005CAATXG|4.0|I downloaded this CD last night after hearing their song \\"Make a Move\\" on the christian radio station Air 1.  I love female pop/rock and love groups like Barlowgirl, Superchick and Flyleaf so I was happy to hear another band with a similar sound that was also christian.    I decided to look up some info about them online and what I found made me just a little disappointed.  I read several interviews with the lead singer and she said that even though they're a christian band, they don't really talk about God or give testimonies or an altar call at their concerts, but she went on to call her music her ministry.  What good is a ministry if you don't share the love of God or the salvation message with people? This is one thing that I truly admire about Barlowgirl and Superchick.  They will come close to almost preaching at their concerts, they're not afraid to testify and witness to people.    So in conclusion, this album definitely contains some solid music and songs with positive messages.  For those of you who are interested in a great CD with some great sounding rock songs, this is definitely a CD for you.  However, if you're looking for a band with a strong christian message and a strong testimony then you might want to look at bands like Barlowgirl or Superchick instead.
B005G4TJUC|1.0|First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!
B003IY48PS|4.0|Evil Dead has much higher name recognition than actual presence on TV and probably availability in general.  After seeing clips from it and periodic references to elsewhere, I finally saw this movie.  I was surprised both good and bad.  It was played up in my mind as distinctive, a bit cheesy, and with a cheap look that might keep it off TV.  None of that was true.  The movie attempts to be serious, is a bit dull from having fight scenes which are just a bit too long, and is solid but not memorable.  The story begins as five friends (two couples, and the sister of one of the men) go camping in a cabin in the woods.  When night comes, a few odd things happen, and investigation leads to the discovery of some odd artifacts, including a tape recording.  When the friends play the tape recording, a scholar of ancient texts explains that he has translated and will read the text of an ancient book which describes how to summon demons.  The tape recorded incantation summons all kinds of trouble including blocked escape routes from the forest, trees raping a camper, and eventually demonic possession for some of the campers.  This leads to some over-the-top gore in the context of demonic possession, including blood dripping and praying from inannimate objects and eventually people.  It isn't terribly scarey because it's over-the-top.  You probably already know whether you want to watch this or not.  The tree rape scene makes a viewing worthwhile, if you are into horror movies.
B004LROMSY|5.0|The tone and visual of this series lies somewhere between The Tudors and the first season of Spartacus: a fair heaping of graphic sex, lots of action and fighting and blood, plus sorcery and magic to boot. I thought they did a good job of making the show appeal to both women and men, which is not an easy task - could easily have too much historical emphasis and costuming & pomp, or too much blood and action.  We must keep in mind there was no real King Arthur but only many myths and theories. I have seen and read many retellings and think they've done some clever and creative things in this show. They strike a nice balance between the barbaric and the noble in the lifestyle of the time - no gleaming armor, but rough furs and leather armor instead, with rough thrones and much smaller castles and armies than usually pictured. In a way, it makes every struggle more urgent and visceral when there are only a handful of men against each other  in this way.  They have cast some quite good actors such as Joseph Fiennes, Eva Green and others. I like this trend of movie actors doing television and especially cable which can be more intense. I also recognized some other faces such as the lead from TV's short lived \\"Crusoe\\" (really, how long could a show based on that book go on?). I hope that fans of both fantasy and action check the show out. Starz is definitely doing some interesting things and I look forward to seeing thier other upcoming shows such as Torchwood (one of my favorite shows, which I was crushed when it was cancelled).
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Pandorum was a nice surprise.  I hadn't heard of it but really enjoyed it and would watch it again.  The story begins as a man wakes up on a spaceship bound on a hundred year voyage from an overpopulated earth to a distant planet which can support life.  Suspended animation has given the man temporary memory loss which wears off with time.  He knows he is a member of the flight crew, and finds one other crew man.  As his memories come back, the man tries to find other members of the flight crew, and to determine just what is off about the spaceship.  As it turns out, a lot is off.  Strange human-like creatures roam the ship, and they like to eat anything they can find, and the generator at the core of the spaceship seems to be failing as there are intermittent brown outs.  Soon the man encounters other people awake from suspended animation.  Together they try to survive the strange creatures that want to eat them and to determine what has gone wrong with the ship and where they are in their voyage.  The story unfolds really well.  The film was moody and even though I kind of saw plot points coming, I didn't see clearly enough to get bored, and there were unpredictable and well-done tangents into the lives of the few people in the story. Best of all, the movie had a good ending.  That's important.  Overall, if this movie sounds like it might appeal to you, then I recommend watching it and checking it out.  It was a pretty, engaging, and satisfying experience.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Cowboys & Aliens barely grossed enough to cover its budget.  Almost all reviews I've read have been very negative.  Personally, I loved it!  Daniel Craig was definately the big star, followed by Olivia Wilde.  Harrison Ford's role was much smaller than I expected, and his costume (especially his cowboy hat that looked a lot like a fedora) made me see Indiana Jones in several scenes  :)  After the theatrical trailers I always avoid any information about movies, including the cast (I HATE spoilers).  Imagine my surprise when I saw Clancy Brown, the ultimate movie badass, playing the role of a preacher!  The show was almost sold out, & about two-thirds of the crowd looked to be in their 60s or older (nothing personal, of course).  Many say it's because the 1970s-90s generation just aren't as interested in westerns, which much of C&A is.  Whatever...I can't wait to see it again!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Amy Lee's voice is incredible, but that's not what makes this CD stand out as an amazing work of art. The percussion drives almost every song, and the lyrics are stunning. I hate to make the comparison, but songs like \\"What You Want\\" have the depth of lyrics associated with bands like Rush, Pink Floyd, etc. This is a borderline prog rock CD. I'm blown away. A+++
B0054SMIH6|5.0|there are only three movies of mathew i like this is one of them. this movie keeps you wondering and on the edge of your seat the entire time. great storyline and great actors. the other two movies i like of his are: how to lose a guy in ten days & a time to kill.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Perhaps it's the nostalgia of playing the old Call of Duty games and watching black-and-white WWII films with my dad when I was little, but this set brought me nothing but pure joy throughout the entire experience.  First off, the Blu-ray quality is spot-on beautiful.  Everything just pops in 1080p.  The sound is crystal clear too.  Bombs crashing onto the battlefield make my sub shake the room.  The well-trained actors can be easily heard even during the action sequences.  When you can't hear them it's because you're not supposed to--perhaps a grenade blew up nearby or a high caliber gun is shooting off.  No mistakes can be found in the history of this story either.  The facts are facts.  Everything that happens in the series happened on those Japanese islands.  I do not regret anything about my purchase and would recommend this to ANY WWII fan.  Why are you still reading this review?  Buy it!  You won't regret it either!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|good movie i hope there is a part two because at the end of this one they leave it open for more... and i want more.
1401229921|4.0|I gave it only four stars because I thought it was the large book my daughter wanted with the colored pictures; however, it wasn't.  Should the book become available in the large size and with colored pictures, please let me know.  My daughter loved it, but it is not the exact one she wanted.

1905492073|5.0|Fantastic book on basic deco theory and science, written for the average diver. This book is a great read in preparation for a deco procedures, or trimix course.
0385344325|3.0|This latest Reacher novel is dreary and wordy.  I gave myself a choice of 'Shockwave ' and this one. I opened each book and noticed the closeness of the print of The Affair  v Shockwave. No contest.  So onto the book which has more adjectival filler than a Sophomore's laziest essay. This book will not keep you up all night and frustrate your partners sexual needs. Rather it will send you quietly and easily to sleep. The idea that a sexual encounter for the first time can endure for longer than 10 minutes has me mystified.There is undue repetition and the villain, thank you you Jerk spoilers above, your miserable lives need to be increasingly frustrated, is a very easy and poorly delineated target. Other villains have been worthy of the name. Not this one, who is simply venal.   Lee Child is English and knows the difference between 'ensure ' and 'insure '. Not here, I know it's petty but it still is setting poor standards.  And then we have the comments about Gen. Eisenhower and roads leading to the US interstate system. Everyone knows that by the end of WW 11 Germany had a t least 2000 kms of Autobahnen. So the evidence was right there before his very eyes.  I say give the man a rest and see if he can come back with a new approach. Ater all that seems to be what Sandford has done by branching out into his 'F'''k''g Flowers' character.  Personally I would like to see what Neagely has been up to. Lee Child is an excellent author, if the ' Reacher ' novels have become a straightjacket so try another character. Always assuming Lee Child still has the enthusiasm.
B000SINT52|5.0|An amazing movie, that was a real eye opener.  The only issue I had with it was how bummed out it made me.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I loved how fast I received the movie, I couldnt have been happier to have received it. Movie was as promised in mint condition. Great buy! Super Happy.
1400052181|3.0|In some ways this story is disturbing; how medical care was handled for African-Americans in the 1950's, separate wings, equipment,--- but it really shouldn't be surprising or disturbing.  It was an era between the abolition of slavery and social awareness and equal rights.  But even so, the author seems slant and lead the reader to believe that the use of tissue (or re-using discarded body tissue after surgeries or procedures)was only done to African Americans, that simply is not true.  Only when you get to Afterword does she state that as of 1999 there were tissue samples of 178 million people stored in the United States alone.  So this isn't a withholding of information for African Americans alone, but something that was essentially medical policy until the policy changed regarding \\"informed consent\\".  I suspect that families like the Lack's didn't have the education or means to challenge, or request information until someone like Rebecca Skloot came along (author).  It was an interesting story in the first half of the book.  However, it almost seemed the writing style changed; became choppy, and dragged on. One more tearful episode about Deborah (daughter of Henrietta Lacks) shutting down and shutting the author out was not necessary.  Although I understand how the Lack's family fits into the whole story, I feel the author injected herself too deeply in the story. It felt a bit self-serving to me.   This isn't a story about an amazing woman, but a story of the amazing cells of Henrietta Lacks. Because what is unique is how the HeLa cells continue to duplicate themselves when other cells do not.

B005C9YZIW|5.0|Most people don't get the opportunity to see the world. With BBC's Planet Earth: Special Edition, everyone can see the world through a whole new, high def perspective.<br /><br />The series is broken up into 11 different episodes that capture great footage of different habitats and the animals that live there. The stories are wonderfully narrated (and can tug on your heart strings.) The Special Edition comes with bonus video diaries that contain behind the scenes footage for each episode/habitat that share wonderful insight into \\"how it's made.\\" It also includes Planet Earth: The Future and other bonus features.<br /><br />Planet Earth: Special Edition is captivating and wonderful to watch for both kids and adults. It really helps one appreciate the majesty and beauty of the world we live in.
B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust is a Classic! All the songs are brilliant, with a mix of Heavy metal and funk.The baND REALLY SHINE ON aNGEL dUST! The sound of Faith no more is real unique and original. Real Thing is a wonderful classic but Angel Dust is genious! One of the best of the 90´s.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I've been a fan of Puscifer for a couple years now.  This is easily their best work.  Green Valley is my favorite track at the moment.  SOLID ALBUM!  <3
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I really enjoy Mesmerize. After two masterpieces and Steal this album, System of a Down was in the top of the metal world. Mesmerize brings the absolutely classics B.Y.O.B, Revenga and Cigaro.All the songs are nice unique metal pieces. Mesmerize and Hipnotize are classic modern Thrash Metal.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Just an amazing high production film of Xtreme snow boarding in some of the most inaccessible and beautiful places on this planet. I prefer skiing to snow boarding but this is a must have video, with breath taking scenery and great airial shots. I would have cut out the shooting and blowing up bits in the film, a bit Sarah Palin, and replaced it with filming of the wild. But a great film and great music.
B000002GK1|5.0|All the music from Soundgarden catalogue is great. They are one of the greatest bands from the metal world, and Badmotorfinger is their classic! Some gems like Outshined and Jesus Christ Pose and other gorgeous moments like Searching with my good eye closed and Room a thousand years wide. In fact, all the songs are great! Soundgarden was at the top in the early 90's.
B000AP04NI|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for an older friend who was simply thrilled to re-view a movie that she'd loved from years ago --especially in this beautiful new edition.  Well done!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Hypnotize is a great metal album. I really like Mesmerize, but i think Hypnotize is more raw and furious. All the two Mesmerize and Hypnotize are great, with many high moments.Hypnotize is even better and heavier than Mesmerize.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Scotty has done everything right. Really nice young guy, respectful, appreciates real country music and has a baritone voice that is as good as masters like Randy Travis. Sadly, the song selection is a 'painting by numbers', radio executives choice. Clearly aimed at the pop music fans of American Idol - the producer Mark bright and other people involved in this debut album have not allowed real country to fill the album. However, for the fact that there are about 4 really good tracks  on this album, I will still rate it as 4 star.  The standout songs include 'Back on the ground' and 'That old king James'. Rich, raw and genuinely country. But the track that deserves the most praise is 'clear as day' and the emotional references to a Silverado and a moving incident.   The album is definitely a grower and after several listens, you will start to enjoy it more.   Lets hope we get a more traditional album next.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Little Dorrit is quality television, I really enjoyed it. Seemingly 7 hours, very well acted and very well told. The 30 minute episode format was a bit distracting but I am sure it was designed for television in these small 30 min blocks.   Price is a bit steep above $30 but well worth it for 7 hours of entertainment for two.  We need more period pieces that are not all Jane Austin!
B005FUTBWS|4.0|Kevin Smith's \\"Red State\\" is such a bold and angry film, there's a tendency to forgive its many faults. It's telling that almost an hour after watching this work, my friends and family were still discussing the plot's ebbs and flows and ultimately, its thematic significance. Smith should be applauded for writing and directing an unorthodox statement on some of the more troubling aspects of society, but he sabotages his own efforts with his trademark snark dialog and an ambition which surpasses an obviously low budget.      I have always considered Smith's work to be overrated, though [[ASIN:B00000IQC8 Clerks (Collector's Series)]] is a classic statement of its era. \\"Red State,\\" for the most part, is unlike anything he's ever attempted. He mixes a variety of genres, tilting what is essentially a horror film upon its head to become a satirical statement on religion, oppression, human rights and violence. He has a brilliant cast at his disposal, though I question the hiring of Michael Parks in the crucial role of the Reverend Abin Cooper. It's a gimmicky choice, as Parks' Hopperesque persona is better served for supporting work. A more substantial actor would have raised the level of this film several notches. Of course, Parks gives the greatest performance of a long and peculiar career, but opposed to what? [[ASIN:6305245487 Death Wish V: The Face of Death]]? [[ASIN:B0001E7TL8 The Evictors]]? Anyway, he's the leader of an especially sinister religious clan, a sort of combination of David Koresh and Fred Phelps, regularly protesting homosexuality while stockpiling a deadly arsenal of weapons at his rural compound.     Three teenagers (Michael Angarano, Nicholas Braun, Kyle Gallner) decide to borrow the parents' car and drive to the country to visit a middle-aged woman encountered on-line for an evening of casual sex. They meet Sara (Melissa Leo) at a rundown trailer and are drugged and kidnapped. They awaken to discover they are hostages of Cooper's religious compound,being lined up for sacrifice due to their sinful ways. Reverend Cooper gives a fascinating 10-minutes-long sermon before dragging the first hostage on stage, gagged and wrapped in cellophane. I'm not sure I can forgive Smith for this extended sequence of misery and murder, though one does not have a doubt as to these fanatics' intentions. Almost to the minute the ATF arrives on the scene in preparation of a raid, led by none other than John Goodman. As usual, Goodman steals just about every scene he's in due to his intensely natural presence, an underrated actor who is the Robert Duvall of modern times. Things immediately go awry, as they usually do when the ATF decides to strong-arm religious compounds ([[ASIN:B0000DIJOO Waco - The Rules of Engagement]]), and people drop dead about as quickly as they did in Peckinpah's Battle of Bloody Porch ([[ASIN:0790731037 The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut]]).     Ultimately, the ATF are given the green light to kill everyone on-site after government executives dub the compound's inhabitants as terrorists, thus even women and children become opportunities for target practice. Quite a few interesting characters are introduced, only to be unceremoniously killed in shocking fashion. I can see what Smith is doing here, going against conditioned expectations of traditional Hollywood flow. There's even one very good supporting actor you suspect to have a more substantial role whose head is blown off after barely a line of dialog. Such intentional chaos hurts the film, but your mouth will be agape.      The already-mentioned low budget is apparent during the ATF's attempts to attack the compound. It's clear there is no military order, and a hand-held camera mixed with rapid editing camouflages what is essentially a home movie reproducing chaos. When the smoke finally clears, there's barely an actor left standing and a minutes-long speech attempting to analyze all that has come before lacks the poetic depth Smith was attempting. But this is truly a brave film revealing signs of a spiritually enraged artist. Smith said he plans to retire from directing, which to me sounds like the pontifications of a drama queen. He has shown a level of promise in \\"Red State\\" not seen in his past work. If he throws the gimmicks out the window and eliminates the bawdy snark, he's going to hit a home run soaring so far it will shock even him.
0792160347|5.0|This is a classic '80's flick directed by Paul Shrader who also wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver. To me, four films made Gere the icon he is today: Breathless, Looking for Mr. Goodbar, An Officer and a Gentleman, and this film, which Siskel and Ebert chose as one of their favorite films of the '80's.<br /><br />Gere plays the title role in this film, well-dressed and well-schooled in the art of seducing old, rich, white women by his pimp who--in a reversal of the pimp-whore paradigm--is a female. Another pimp, a big black dude, played by Bill Duke has had his eye on Gere and wants him in his stable, although his gay, kinky, and often downright perverse clientele are not to Gere's tastes--yet.In a world of fake love, fake passion, sometimes even gigolos need love too.<br /><br />I'll just leave it to that and not spoil this film for anybody who hasn't seen it yet. This film is a time machine: the clothes, the music courtesy of Blondie and disco--which was on its way out, the cars,Lauren Hutton, Bill Duke (who also played Abdullah in Car Wash, another classic). Terrific film. Get this and Breathless.
0743454537|3.0|I started this book yesterday morning and just finished it this evening.  When I wasn't reading the book, I was constantly wondering about the characters and what would happen next.  I don't know that the writing style was incredible, but the style varied from character to character; I found myself sympathizing with Jesse and Brian, and disliking Sara. And the plot certainly held my interest.  But then the ending. :-/  Oh, the ending... I mean, yeah, the book is fiction so it's not true, but the ending was just this weird little package that seemed to tie up all the loose ends in a totally unsatisfying way.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Nice short book, very authentic writing. Everyone should spend an hour of their lives reading this book. What you get does not buy happiness, who you are gets you there faster.

B005KCGIUY|5.0|Puscifer started as a way for Maynard James Keenan (of Tool and A Perfect Circle fame) to express some of the wilder, stranger music he wanted to make. While that is still definitely present in \\"Conditions of My Parole\\", it is also obvious that Puscifer has truly grown up and come into its own with this album. It is, in short, a breathtaking masterpiece, and a wonderful new direction for this band.  From the quiet crooning of \\"Tumbleweed\\" to the beautiful lamentations of \\"Horizons\\", the listener truly feels like they are taking part in a grand adventure, and at heart that's really what this is; the travelogue of a journey out West and all of the sorrow, desire, adventure, and hope that go along with it.  If you've been at all interested in anything Puscifer or MJK himself have made before, do yourself a favor and pick this up. This is the type of beauty and growth that most projects can only dream of.
B000VI70X6|5.0|Muito bom! A cantora dispensa comentários. As melhores canções estão no cd/dvd. O dvd tem ótima qualidade de imagem e som, só deveria ter legendas das canções.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I bought this CD at the same time I bought: Enya, Green Day 21st century breakdown, All That Remains For we are many, Dropkick Murphys Going out in Style! Very epic band. If you really want some nostalgic listen to the Symphony part 1. It's like listening to the Star Trek theme but I'm in as much into Star Trek anymore I like I use to be. I'm a huge Stargate SG1 fan now I found it to be more hardcore for sci fy. But anyway you should buy this cd even if its just for the sake of it. After I bought it I burned it my pc and downloaded it to my ZuneHD sometimes I would take the cd for a ride in the car too!
B004ZZLX5W|3.0|As a huge fan of Arcade Fire (and as an admirer of Spike Jonze's films) I feel that I should state that AF should stick to music and Spike Jonze should stick with Charlie Kaufman as his screenwriter. Because, frankly, 'Scenes' is a mess and borders on amateurish. The film gets 0 stars; the music gets 5 stars.
0440244412|5.0|I really loved this book and the entire series.  There were times that it kind of grossed me out (eating Unseelie flesh, blech), but considering that the last two book are pretty much post-apocalyptic, it didn't phase me too much.     Be warned, Mac does end up sleeping with someone, I won't say who, so for those who prefer no sex scenes, I would stay away.  But I guess if the last book didn't turn you off, then you should be ok, because the sex scenes were not explicitly graphic.    Mac finally hunts down and imprisons the Sinsar Dubh, but not without some twists and turns.  She finds out who and what exactly she is, and its not what she thought.    Ms. Moning's writing style is so fluid, that I found myself easily getting lost in the reading, without a care to what was going on around me.  Most of the loose ends were neatly tied together and topped with a bow, except for Mac and Dani's relationship.  Mac discovers something about Dani and was very nearly unable to forgive her, at which point Dani takes off and isn't seen for the rest of the book.  From what I've heard, though, there is going to be a spin-off series from Dani's point of view and it will cover them reconciling and whatnot.  At one point in the book, near the end, we discover the true identity of a certain someone, and when I read that part, I just stared at the page, and said \\"WHAT???\\" Yeah, it was like that, lol.  We also find out who the Unseelie King is (hint:  its more than one person).    The thing about this story, is that it is not a stand-alone story.  There are some book series that you can pick up one book in the middle of the series and know everything that's going on...this is not one of those series.  You would need to start from the beginning to understand everything that's going on, otherwise you'll just be lost.    If you liked this series, I highly recommend checking out the authors Highlander series.    [...]
B004VSTP4Y|1.0|Seems this was Steivater's attitude about her last book. It rambled about nothing in particular, and ended just as the story finally got started. Stunningly lame, especially considering the quality of the first two.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I have always loved this film and finally was able to locate it at AMAZON.  How fortunate for me!  As soon as it arrived, I tore open the package and sat down to immediately watch the film.  Watching these two outstanding actors perform in every scene of the film never ceases to amaze me.  This is, indeed, a movie classic and I will now be able to watch it whenever I please.  Your film library is outstanding and I look forward to finding many more treasures for purchase.  PAM
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Tree of Life needs to be approached with an open mind, for if you are approaching this strictly because Brad Pitt is starring, or because Malick is directing, or because you heard the movie won an award then your experience watching the film will preclude any satisfaction. The story arch progresses and digresses unlike any other big-budget movie I have ever seen (including Malick's other films) and can easily frustrate the viewer, evidenced by the stories of people walking out of theaters and by the mass of 1-star reviews.  But if you are able to limit, or even eliminate, your references to the traditional motion picture's story arc, narrative, and scope then the movie will be much more powerful and mean a lot more. The film represents Malick's philosophy about reality and life (which has been the backbone through most all his films, but in Tree of Life most blatantly) and about how a man dealt with his own human conditioning (graceful Mother and Darwinian Father) amid this big picture.  This film starts to break the barrier of language and spectacle and starts to communicate to the viewer at a deeper level, somewhat like poetry.  I understand this sounds extremely pretentious, but if taken seriously and just experienced with an open mind, the film entertains and informs us at a level beyond the limits of the medium.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Steven Wilson is the David Lynch of progressive rock. The music on this album is cinematic, operatic, thrilling, and unsettling. I dare you to listen to \\"Raider II\\" in a dark room with your eyes closed. I dare you. The tension is like nothing I've ever heard in a song before, and you'll find yourself nearly aching to find out what you're going to hear next... whether the tension will break upon some kind of resolution or release.  The entire album plays out this way, winding fluidly between moments of stark beauty only to cascade into dense, bewildering passages of what I can only describe as auditory terror. Sparse piano solos intertwine with acoustic and electric guitars, otherworldly industrial howling, soaring choirs, rousing strings, clarinet, flute, and saxophone. I can promise you've never heard anything like it.  It's beautiful, intense, captivating, and arresting. Even casual fans of progressive rock and classical music will find a lot to like here. And even if you don't, you can bet you'll remember it just the same.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I was living out of the country when this movie came out and had been wanting to see it.  However, I did not want to pay a lot of money for it.  Ordering via Amazon.com gave me the option of various prices to choose from.  My copy arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  The movie is wonderful and enjoyed by not only my husband and myself but my granddaughters also.  Great movie and great shipper!

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks and have been for quite some time.  I have loved many of his past books, particularly The Guardian and The Notebook, but this book was a bit of a dissapointment.  Although the characters were very likable, I found this book hard to really get in to.  It didn't \\"pull\\" me in as most of his other works have.  I did find that it was very easy to relate to most of the characters but there was not enough emphasis put upon Amanda and Dawson's relationship, so although you were very sympathetic for their situation and wanted to learn more about their relationship, it wasn't a surprise when things worked out as they did.      Sparks always manages to write very heartfelt yet heartbreaking stories but this book is just a bit below par. It is for the most part a very realistic book, although it does have a few unbelievable twists thrown in here and there, but there definitely could have been a bit more emphasis on certain parts of the storyline.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone, it just fell a bit below my expectations for Nicholas Sparks and it definitely was not on the same level of some of his other works.  I certainly look forward to seeing what he comes up with next.  No matter what, he always gives us a very enjoyable read and I have all confidence that he will continue to do so.
B004SKQAJI|3.0|It was just fair, I have 3 others that where made by Flatley and this was all  backround effect, it got to the point where you could not see them dancing. Feet of Flames & the first Lord of the Dance where simpler & better.
B003L77GGK|5.0|If you have never watched this tv series and you like all kind of stuff that goes creeping through the night you need to watch this from season one up through now! I promise you it's worth every penny. No body has told me different on this recommendation. This series is truly addicting.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|When In Outer Space--as a Green Lantern movie SHOULD be the movie REALLY gets things right & is fun & visually grabbing.  On Earth--mostly, meh, with an occasional DASH of fun.  That said, I thought that what it got right--Oa, The Guardians, the Corp, Hal--mostly, Sinestro, Killowog, Tomar Re--basically all the off Earth material--it got REALLY right & IF they do go ahead with a sequel, THAT is where the movie needs to be focused. For non-comic fans--The GL Corp is the equivalent of the Jedi, but in some ways more powerful because their rings are only limited by the users' will and imagination.  As for the differences from the comics, i think the oddest one was that they portrayed Hal as someone who acted cocky to hide his fear, versus being the guy who gets into trouble because he's SO confident in himself that he rushes in thinking there's nothing he can't handle.  I guess they thought he needed an \\"arc\\" that was more relatable?  Anyway, having re watched it now, and also really enjoyed the extras (IF you like behind the scenes material, the Blu Ray disc has a pretty good assortment), I give it a solid 4 out of 5 for a good effort that is FUN to watch & for the reverence to the source material.(MOSTLY--Parallax = Krona seemed a misuse/waste of 2 villains by combining them into one & into the same movie.  I don't understand why they do that so often in comic movies, but again, only readers of the books will notice.)
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I rarely watch a movie twice.  I watched this one twice because I loved it.  The dancing was amazing, but more importantly, there was a \\"moral\\" here about not giving up and working to reach your personal goals.  A must see.

B004EPZ07U|2.0|Amazon's listing for this title is \\"Green Lantern (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)\\". I don't remember the 'Ultraviolet' being in the listing when I placed my order. In any case, if you read the specifications, this is not a Three-Disc product, there are only two discs in the package and accessing the digital copy requires \\"an Ultraviolet account and a Flixster account\\". I don't need any more accounts floating around in the cloud so the digital copy is a non-starter for me.
B005HWUBZ0|4.0|I am playing this album as I write this review. I am in love with this one as much as I was with \\"Strange Arrangement.\\" I would have given it 5 Stars but because of Snoop Dogg's appearance (and the fact that I hate rap/hip hop with a passion) I give it 4 Stars. As for Snoop's appearance on \\"Can't Stop\\" he actually sings, and does a good job. The song's a little naughty but I rate it PG since there is a lot worse on many an album these days. The rest of the album is wonderful. It takes me back to a time when music meant something and those days are long gone, in my opinion. If you're a fan I say get this one for sure. If you have kids, play Track 3 with caution.
B005P5TS5I|5.0|Very exciting episode, and in my opinion worth the long wait for the new season! I gotta love bringing the three best bad guys ever (Crowley, the Horseman Death, and Nick/Lucifer) together in one episode. Kudos, by the way to the three actors who play the parts as well as the writers. It looks to me like the start of another great season.
0385534639|3.0|Maybe it was all the hype surrounding this book, but I expected more. I love a story rich with characters that develop over the course of the book, but that didn't happen here. What the book did have was beautiful writing. The entire story is written with such intricate descriptions that you easily be able to envision each setting. Morgenstern's imagination runs free and takes the reader along for the ride. If this circus was making the rounds - we would all flock to it to wonder at the awe of something so magical. Who knew that simply describing the workings of a clock could be so moving and make it feel so tangible?<br /><br />The portions of the book that I had a problem with were the characters and the timing. The chapters float around back and forth in time - which I often couldn't keep straight, and after having read the book I'm not certain that there was even a need for such movement in time. The book already covers thirty-ish years and includes an enormous amount of characters, that was enough to keep track of on its own. Due to the fact that there were so many characters and much time was spent on the lovely descriptions, there wasn't much room for character development or growth. I never felt anything for any of the characters - even Celia and Marco, the main characters. I didn't care about their love or their pains; it just didn't feel real or substantial. The second half was much better than the first portion of the book - once you get through figuring out what's going on and who all the people are it moves toward a bit more of a storyline. Though if you like a story that is all about the setting - you will simply adore this one.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B005R9PBK8|5.0|The writer of this episode has outdone himself in the creepy department! Ben Edlund, there has to be something wrong with you (but in a good way actualy, I'm just kidding, I think)! The little girl that gets taken over is the most exquisitely horrible blend of sweet little girl and CREEPY villian imagineable! The new bad guys, the leviathins, are powerfully scary. Sam's hallucinations and Dean being able to help him with his experience provides an emotionally powerful punch to the episode. In my opinion, a great episode!
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I love Nicholas Sparks but this book is terrible.  If I had bought the paperback of this book I would promptly return it.  The plot is so predictable and the sad twist now seems to be a mainstay in all of the books.  When I finished this book I felt like the story was rushed, poorly laid out and not finished.  Skimming through the acknowledgments he mentions that this book was difficult to write and it shows.
B0034G4P8A|3.0|3.4 stars<br /><br />I first read Thor in 1970 or so and still think it's one of Jack Kirby's best creations. It's nice to see his name on this in spots instead of Stan \\"Me! Me! All Me!\\" Lee stealing credit from him or Ditko or etc, as has been usual for decades now. It's Kirby's vision that made those books really worth reading, and still is.<br /><br />This version had me hoping highly, as Branagh's epic-Bard-feel screen rating is usually solid. Sadly, despite some nice moments, I just didn't feel the Thunder God vibe anywhere nearly as much I was hoping to. Hemsworth quite simply doesn't have the gravitas. His acting is abysmal in the first half hour, then gets mildly better; one gets the feeling that Hopkins took him aside and tersely reminded him what acting looks like. Hopkins' Odin is the only role with real edge here, and he gets some strong scenes in. But everyone else left me cold.<br /><br />Loki was nowhere near the scheming prince of darkness he should be, and Thor's buddies had no real oomph either. Portman and Denning are simply weak at best, and the whole love interest thing was handled poorly; the fireside scene is laughable. They should have had some NKOTB playing in the background.<br /><br />The effects get better as the film goes on, but Asgaard is in general a huge disappointment. I had to laugh at how they made Valhalla a big suburb; look at how over-developed the whole area is. It looks like LA! Every square inch is built over with huge apartments. So this is what the Norse Gods earn for their bravery? Levittown in space? Ridiculous.<br /><br />Plus the now-standard quiet dialogue then sudden massive sound effect wall of noise gets worse as the movie goes on; we had to ride the remote the whole movie. Blu-rays need to start coming with a separate non-home theater track for when those of us with neighbors less than a mile away are watching a film after dark. This was simply way too much dynamic range for no real good reason. I used to play electric guitar for a living and even I found this pointlessly loud at moments.<br /><br />Idris Elba had a good feel for the material and seemed one of the few to really grok the original Thor, even in his minor role. Epic, yet understated. No one else but Hopkins had read the source, apparently. But this is Hollywood, after all. Subtlety is almost a cuss word there in these huge CGI blowouts.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the effects have some fine moments, the end of the bridge being the best, but in general the good blu-ray transfer made the plastic costumes and sets all too clearly fake at times. This looks good but could have looked SO much better and more non-Hollywood authentic. As with the script, and most of the acting, and even the direction. Frankly, as a director, Branagh is a fabulous actor.<br /><br />If pecs and abs could act, Hemsworth would be Olivier. But they can't, and he ain't, and as the key to the whole tale he brings this movie down to the realm of merely nice eye candy.<br /><br />A pleasant diversion, but go check out the Kirby originals again and see how truly epic this tale can really be.ctric guitar for a living and even I found this pointlessly loud at moments.<br /><br />Idris Elba had a good feel for the material and seemed one of the few to really grok the original Thor, even in his minor role.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I know some might not like to hear me admit this, but the character of Simba kind of gets me annoyed in The Lion King. Yes, I know he's young and foolish at the start, but when he brags and taunts Scar, he spurs the villainous lion into his treachery. When he sings \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King,\\" he's not realizing what has to happen for him to be king. When Mufasa is killed, only a moron would believe what Scar is able to convince him of. And yes, I know, that's part of the story arc -- that Simba must mature and get a clue before he is worthy of his kingdom.<br /><br />But the film has never fully convinced me that Simba truly reaches that point. It actually seems that Simba's ascent is more due to the efforts of Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Sarabi, Nala and the ghost of Mufasa. Yet he gets to be king anyway. Maybe my perspective is tainted by some real-life business politics, but I've never been able to shake this feeling, at least until The Lion King 1 1/2, when Simba actually acknowledges and thanks Timon and Pumbaa. (The Broadway show also was able to allow Simba's character more introspection that isn't possible in the format of an animated film.)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The Lion King is a masterwork and a landmark Disney animated film, a perfect storm of talent and artistry that continues to command awe from the public, even recently in its 3-D release.<br /><br />What makes The Lion King even more amazing is how close it came to never happening, or at least faltering along the way. A candid, revelatory bonus feature, which is included on both the Blu-ray and the DVD (unlike the commentary and many other features which are exclusive to the Blu-ray), Producer Don Hahn narrates the story of the film from his perspective. During most of its production, The Lion King was considered \\"the lesser project\\" next to Pocahontas, it went through several personnel changes and backstage angst, and the filmmakers were concerned that the public would reject the movie--right up to the first release date.<br /><br />That's why such bonus material is so valuable and important. This knowledge serves to make me appreciate The Lion King even more, even if Simba gets my goat a little. (Of course, if really he got my goat, it would little more than a snack, wouldn't it?).

B000AJJNOK|5.0|My car was broken into about 2 years ago and one of the CD/DVDs I had in the car was \\"The Massacre\\" with DVD, which once I realized it was gone I knew I would replace it.  Well the day final came this year. I ordered it and it came in 3 days. As soon as I got it I listened and watched them both.  A classic still!! Fifty's style on this album always inspires me to get out there and go for mine.  I know most people think that he's all about flossin', pimpin', or starting drama, but if you really pay attention to the overall undertone of his album you'll see that he's really talking about grinding to get what you what out of life and not letting anyone stand in your way, especially, yourself.  So I encourage any fan of Hip Hop to definitely get this album and expand your artistic mind and really listen for Fifty's ability to inspire entrepreneurship, and self motivation; Something we all could use during these economic times.  Keep Grindin'  Patrick

B005J7K964|5.0|Hey, Hey, they are actually going to release this version of the movie, with the \\"contemporary\\" soundtrack!  I always knew the robot before I ever saw this film.  Then they released this version in the early 80's when I was in high school.  This came out and I saw it and it BLEW my mind!  The film, not the music.  BUT, the music had some artists that I really, really like, like Freddie from Queen, John Anderson from Yes, and I also like Pat Benatar very much.  The song by Cycle V was incredible in the film (blood from a stone).  The other artists, like Loverboy, Billy Squier, and Adam Ant really did a fine job of having the songs they sang fit with the music, I've always wondered what other songs we could put with the movie and see what happens.  Giorgio Moroder's couple of songs are really really good as well.  So, I loved this version.  I got the Laserdisc and copied it to DVD years later.  I find the film very powerful, and just can NOT believe that they made this thing in the 1920's!!  Anyone who has any interest in film simply MUST see this film, it is MANDATORY viewing, either with or without the 80's soundtrack.  Whether you like it or not, it must be viewed to complete ones' education in film.  Cheers.
1594744769|4.0|As a child, Jacob was fascinated by his grandfather, Abraham's stories of his childhood, growing up in an orphanage on an island off the coast of Wales during World War II. The stories were a bit unusual, though, as Abraham spoke of children who could levitate, lift giant boulders and be invisible. He had the pictures to prove it. But as Jacob grew up, he began to doubt his grandfather, just as everyone else in his family did, and the stories ended. Now, Abraham has died under unusual circumstances and Jacob has vowed to return to the island and find the home where his grandfather grew up.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs is a rather unique story. The first few chapters were extremely creepy to me ~ and the pictures interspersed throughout the novel made it even more so. As I was reading about Abraham's death and Jacob's initial experiences on the island, it felt like the makings of a horror story. But it turned out to be much more sci-fi and fantasy than horror. I especially enjoyed the contrast between the island in 1940 and that of the present day, as well as the unique characters Riggs created.<br /><br />There is plenty of suspense and a bit of action, but underneath it all is an intriguing story about the individual people involved in the story ~ from Jacob to his grandfather and father, to the children who lived in the home with Abraham and the woman who took care of them. I don't want to say much more about the plot since one of the things I enjoyed most about the book was the mystery of it. If you like sci-fi and fantasy stories, I definitely recommend this one. It's a quick read that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and bring you into a fascinating world.<br /><br />One last note: I generally read a lot of ebooks these days, but I read a review of this book at Red House Books blog, which said that you have to hold the book in your hands. So I bought the hardcover and she was absolutely right. It just wouldn't have the same impact without the visuals that Ransom Riggs includes throughout the book. So if you're going to read it, get the physical book!visuals that Ransom Riggs includes throughout the book. So if you're going to read it, get the physical book!
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|this was a great Movie, I Love all disney movies dumbo happens to be one of my favorites and was glad that I bought this for myself and my family and we can watch it over and over again
B0049P1VHS|5.0|An awesome character-driven series that gets you hooked by the very first episode. It arrived a day early, and just in time to re-watch season 1 in time for the season 2 premiere.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|This movie was terrible, over blown and did not need to be made.  This only shows a band hopped up on fame and their 20+ years of lacking creativity since 93.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Great quality, and I'm especially thankful for the slim packaging design which takes into consideration my already crowded shelf space.  I've already watched and re-watched episodes on the DVD's numerous times.  Have not had time to review the \\"extras\\" yet because I buy DVD's pretty much for the episodes themselves.    I suppose if there were anything I would improve it's the fact that the episode descriptions are slightly hidden behind the plastic CD holders.  Mildly irritating but not a deal breaker.
B003Q6E7A4|5.0|We had these books when I was a kid and we always loved them.  My 2 year old twins love them too!  Although they're still not old enough to quite understand it all, they are learning some vocabulary words like \\"messy,\\" \\"mean,\\" and \\"twins.\\"  As a teacher, I feel these books are great for teaching young children the meaning of words/adjectives.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I loved this book! I've been a fan of his for many years, and he comes across with all of the arrogance and humor I've come to expect. He writes about things in the restaurant world that most of us will hopefully never see. This book is what I imagine sitting across a bar table from him and just shooting the breeze would be like. He tells tales on former co-workers, former bosses, competitors and himself. Thanks for a most enjoyable read!
B0040UEI3G|5.0|Oui ces 4 CD sont cultissimes.  Petite revue de presse  « [Avec Chritian Zacharias, Scarlatti devient] concentré de vie, de couleurs et prend un poids, une rudesse de ton qu'on ne trouvait pas chez les pianiste qui ne voyaient en lui qu'un pourvoyeur en « bis » élégants, et dont les tous de passe-passe sont goûtés de tous les publics. Les éclats, les humeurs, en un mot la monumentale « dimension » qu'il trouve ici sont de ceux qu'on pourait faire supporter à une sonate de Beethoven. Enfin, Scarlatti prend une carrure et une intelligence ; ce n'est pas trop tôt. » (Etienne Morea, Diapason n° 369 p. 156 - mars 1991)  « Zacharias nous propose cette anthologie excellemment structurée, variant avec brio les caractères gais ou emportés et les pages plus méditatives. Son jeu très classique et presque austère recrée avec un rare bonheur l'univers kaléidoscopique de Scarlatti. Chaque sonate est campée avec franchise et justesse de caractère. Le ton reste toujours élégant et d'une précision remarquable. » (Michel Laizé, Répertoire n° 35 p. 60 - avril 1991)  « [Christian Zacharias] joue avec distinction, certes, mais comme entre deux eaux : toujours entre le forte et le piano, comme tiraillé entre la volonté de jouer sobrement et la tentation de ne pas sous-employer son instrument, avec le risque que cela comporte de basculer dans un univers sonore résolument romantique. Cela dit, grâce a sa technique excellente et notamment sa belle indépendance des deux mains, il nous donne quelques sonates particulièrement réussies : La Sonate en sol majeur K 454 et surtout la Sonate K 455, elle aussi en sol majeur, d'une vélocité fulgurante. » (Jean-Marie Piel, Diapason n° 247 p. 65 - février 1980)  « Grace à une sonorité capiteuse, une « digitalité » souveraine (ses détachés, ses croisement de mains), [Christian Zacharias] peut aligner des trilles d'une surprenante beauté, arborer une volubilitéaccrocheuse (K 96), tisser une texturepianistique d'une rare densité (K 512 ou quatre mains semble parcourir le clavier). S'il n'est pas toujours captivant dans certaines sonates lentes (L 545 ou K 466 en raison de la (très) relative monotonie de sa palette sonore, on trouvera savoureuse la lenteur calculée, avec ses rubatos (effets de rythmes et de tempo) insensés, de la célèbre Sonate K 380. » (Jean-Luc Macia, Compact n° 61 p. 56 - février 1991)
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Lost everything in Bastrop, TX Wildfire.  Starting over with this Box Set.  This tells you something.  I had all the original first pressing Mono Beatles vinyl records, from Meet the Beatles to Magical Mystery Tour, as well as the original first pressing stereo editions.  But this is where I'm starting over- this Mono Box Set.  I also lost this Box Set, to the Wildfire, so I already knew how excellent the sounds on this edition are.  And this is why I'm starting my \\"new\\" collection here.  This is immediate gratification.  It's  not vinyl, but it'll have to do, until I can get the original vinyl again- if I can even afford it this time around.
