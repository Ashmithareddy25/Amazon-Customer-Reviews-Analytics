B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This is NOT a Candy Crush type game and there are no directions anywhere about how it is supposed to work (not intuitive).  Very disappointed.  Finally managed to find the Candy Crush Saga apk on another site and got it on my Kindle Fire.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Another rollicking adventure from Terry Pratchett! If you enjoyed Going a Postal & Making Money you will love Moist's new adventure as the Steam Age arrives on Discworld!
B0026NBZDU|5.0|We'll written, easy to follow with several twists and turns.  Delightfull!  Not the type book that is predictable.  Very few characters to keep up with and all are described well enough to picture them..  Fun read.
1401322425|5.0|The best of all the Jamie Oliver books. If your a fan of the show (also the best of his shows) you'll love the more detail in the recipes (ex 8 tbls instead of &#34;a big glug&#34;)
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is simple: I need a new controller but I want an original SONY controller. This one was from AMAZON and is the original.<br /><br />Works Perfect, grip perfect and is a SONY PS3 controller, you know whar are you buying. The delivery time was great and I replace the old one with this.<br /><br />One word: Original, this is it from amazon.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My husband and I love to sit down with our little boy and watch Shaun the Sheep. The humor makes us all laugh, and we don't worry that he will pick up bad words or bad behavior from the antics of Shaun and the other barnyard animals. Just love this series and wish it had more episodes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My family has threatened to put me in Candy Crush Rehab!!  Love this game and love comparing with family members!
B00511PTWM|5.0|My friends and I were taking a trip and this adapter really came in handy, since two of us could check our cellphones at the sametime while charging them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastic book! I randomly purchased this book, and my goodness, I am SO glad that I did. It definitely was a heart wrencher. It makes you question life and gives you mixed feelings. Hazel is a phenomenal character.
B000FA675C|5.0|read Angels and demons first, because if you like this book you will want to go back and read it, and some of the book will be spoiled
B00G9QLP9Y|3.0|the application is buggy and does not always work well when I'm trying to zoom in. when it does work it is pretty effective.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I am learning gratitude for everything in my life and enjoying life even more thanks to this book. The whole series of The Secret are worth reading they will change your life.
B00F2362IE|3.0|Good graphics but this is a hard game to navigate. I didn't play it very long so maybe it gets better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great and fast read ,leaves you wanting more and more<br />Can't wait to see them make a movie out of this
B003A95GU2|5.0|This may be my favorite album, I continue to listen to it frequently some years after purchasing it. The melodic and rhythmic variety throughout the album, and even within individual songs is great. The energy and creativity in the composition is inspiring. The mood the music evokes is deep and almost tangible.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Game is addictive,but wish the hints wouldn't keep popping up and wish you could play continuously.  Having to wait until you have a new life or lives is frustrating when you have time on your hands and want to play but can't.
140591243X|5.0|I love this book, the story line leaves you wanting more, i didn't want it to end.... I must read.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is our favorite family movie, we always plan to get the family together at least once before Christmas to watch it all together.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The first three-quarters was fascinating, but the plot and action broke down as it progressed.  Battle room was very imaginative.  Characters didn't develop and ending was blah.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great product and visually it makes it easy to quickly use on my small phone! Not much else to say - it's a calculator not a cure for cancer!
6305128952|5.0|Of you have not seen this it is a great movie filled with compassion and love,  Loved it,  It is great for family also
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story is interesting, but it jumps around too much.  Difficult to follow where each character belongs in the family line up.
B0015435OI|5.0|This is one of the few records (that has been produced in recent years) that actually makes sense playing on vinyl.  The tones on this record sound great!  (not to mention that it is very well written)  I love the analog synths which never stood out to me until I listened to this on vinyl.  The item comes with four very thick '45's in a beautiful fold out case.  I do like a lyric sheet, which this does not come with, but Portishead can do whatever they want.  Five stars for Portishead, Third, and this quality product!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|The music is outstanding and the story is heartwarming!  There are a number of 'life lessons' included in the story.
B000F3T3CS|4.0|I saw this in La Scala a few years ago and I mainly bought this to bring back the memories.  Not as great as seeing this in person but a cute opera and great duets.
B005EJNAK4|1.0|I LOVE THE PREVIEW AND THE CONCEPT&#60; LOVE IT&#62;! buutttt...... the movie was horrible the computer graphics were just ridiculous... it looked like they acted it out in Sims and just plugged that into the movie.... would have been so much better if they just put a little more time and money into it, it just looked like something an animation undergrad would do, super disappointed....
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great series.  I was hooked after the first season.  Very cleverly written and characters flawed enough to be almost real.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I could not get into this game. Just not for me. I deleted. Did not seem to be any point in playing.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Easy read and interesting characters.  Depending on the ending whether I would give it 5 stars.  Grisham has a way of disappointing sometimes on endings.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Great story, wonderful cast, and very enjoyable. Its hard to believe it possible but it was even better in HD!!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I love how much history, geography and science Rollins weaves into the story.<br /><br />At first I was a little bothered and his interpretation of Mormons and the relationship they have with several Indian tribes. He made it seem worse than the facts, the LDS church in fact does significant work on a number of reservations and has many Indian members from various tribes. I just had to remind myself this was a novel and not a biography or history book.<br /><br />I love the Sigma Team and it's easy to connect with the various characters. I love the multiple plot lines even when you can tell where they may go Rollins weaves them well and keeps the energy and excitement at a compelling pace.<br /><br />I will be ordering the next book the moment after I submit this review!<br /><br />I will
B0064X7FVE|1.0|app was great. Was is the key word. It upgraded itself and now it is horrible. What was that computer programmer thinking. I just want a simple app to check the weather.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|The book was unputdownable. Detailed explanation adds to the narrative. Brilliant! Strongly recommend as a read to stealth or covert ops fans.
0802130208|5.0|I cannot recommend it highly enough and it remains in my top 10 and will do so forever. I wish I could find the promotional poster that went with the book when it first came out.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|The game is pretty ended. I only missed a online match mode.<br />Excellent. Simple, intuitive UI. A good performance too.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Fun mystery.  Keeps your attention.  Well plotted. Interesting characters, looking forward to reading more about them in the next installment.
B00H1KX87E|5.0|What I love about this author's books, are not only her amazing tales but the insight you gain into Russian life. The stories are not only riveting but also interesting and realistic.<br /><br />In this novel, Anya is a bright young woman who is looking forward to the life lying ahead of her. Having graduated from school she looks forward to marrying Victor as she promises to wait for him whilst he completes his military training. However, life can throw up the unexpected and Anya finds herself alone and her hopes of a life spent with Victor dashed.<br /><br />However, she soon agrees to marry Yuri who is devoted to her and she prepares to be a military wife in a cold and lonely land.<br /><br />The story unfolds brilliantly and without wanting to spoil the book, I can guarantee that the outcome will have you turning pages at a great rate.<br /><br />A fantastic read and very worthy of five stars.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|i don't know why he felt the need to over sexualize this at the beginning, i think the whole story was lost somewhere I don't know honestly i got so bored after the  first few chapters i quit reading and i never do that with stephen king but he just didn't do it for me on this one. it lost the sparkle the shining had, you can't go home again they say. Just my opinion.
B00FATEJYE|3.0|I love this game but whenever I download it , it says you need to delete more games when I only have 2 games
B001BANK32|5.0|awesome book plain and simple, its really really good and im sorry but the sequel just isn't as good, i found it over the top with the characters and it lost the point that this book made so clear, the shining is a classic and i love it :)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story is compelling and the style of writing is one of the best I've read in a very long time. I hope the movie does it justice.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|The king of cool, a good detective story and late 60's era muscle cars in one of the greatest car chases on film.  What more could you ask for in a movie?  Bullitt and Steve McQueen still deliver the goods even 45 years after it's release.  The script is tight and authentic.  The cast and acting are genuine and believable.  The blu-ray transfer is sharp making the film look as if it could have been done today.  Although the film does have it's share of action, if you are looking for mind numbing violence and explosions, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a film that effortlessly transports you to another time and place for a little while, Bullitt is hard to beat.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Very easy to navigate. Many nice features. A real bible study companion. Features good maps, illustrations, footnotes, glossary and outlines.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|A good app.  The only frustrating part is that it doesn't sync well with my Kindle Fire.  The first time it downloads it goes right to where I left off, after that you have to manually catch up.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game for my grandchildren. Keeps them quit in church.  But, they better not do better than me. I won't let them play until I'm as good as they are.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Liked the way the book makes you think while you are reading it and just when you think you have it all figured out there is a curve ball.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Cannot find an app for flash player the only help I could find keeps directing me to reader. Kindle claims it is already loaded, flash player still does not work.
B005COO1X6|1.0|Not much story.  No plot line to connect the different situations.  King has a lot of these stories,  Not surprised.
0545615402|5.0|What's not to love about this collection? I grew up with Harry Potter and had never looked into buying these extra books. It's not to add to my Harry Potter geekdom.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of King's better reads.  I liked the connection to the Shining.  Enjoyed knowing what happens to the son in later years.
B006DLP6JA|2.0|It was great until it stopped working. The CPU lasted a total of 3 months under low load and temperature. Up and died one day and the MB wouldn't even give error codes with a diagnostic board inserted. Now real thrilled.
B00GGZSG40|4.0|It's like any good SG1 episode, except: it is twice as long as normal, the audio and HD video are true Big Screen/Movie Theater Quality. A true must see for all SG1 Fan's!
1582701709|5.0|Is a great book, very deep and you can learn a lot from it!.. Every page it takes you by the hand, sharing the truth from the greatest philosophers, thinkers and speakers in life. Is just a great experience to learn about Victor Hugo, Newton, Einstein, etc. They use the Law of attraction in many ways, and sharing it to the New World. Living us the Secret it self.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|awesome knife it is heavyweight and if I had to have just one knife with me in a outdoor survival situation this would be the one
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Have read Grisham for years. He rarely dissappoints. Gripped me from first page and hated to have it end. Fantastic story, courageous characters, and believable tale. Great Read
B00ADYYY50|5.0|Wiz Kahlifa is the Best!!! Solid album, turn up the bass & enjoy!!! If driving: Role one up, clean your ride in case the hoes want to jump inside! ;)
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|They're all amazing!! .....and may Paul Walker RIP...we're going to miss your presence!!...all the adventure in all 6 movies is worth seeing!...and experiencing!...thanks so much for the ride!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This is a great little set. Let me get my one issue out of the way first which is that the set is pretty small, about 7 or so inches long. Despite the size though this set comes with a lot of nice extras and great little details. The box includes an art book with some behind the scenes stuff about the BTTF movies which was a nice touch. There are also parts to make 1 of 3 versions of the DeLorean from the movies. The original, the hover version with the Mr. Fusion and bar code license plate, and the rail road version from BTTF 3. You can decide which one you want to show off. There are a lot of nice touches in the set too. The inside includes the time coordinates panel with the date that Lego was started. My favorite thing though has to be the OUTATIME license plate. If your a fan of the movies this is a nice collectible to have on the shelf.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I live in Pennsylvania, work in New Jersey, and board my horse in Delaware. This app makes it easy for me to know what to expect no matter where I'm heading. I find the forecasts to be accurate.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Suspenseful! Plus I love zombies, the way they can recreate a zombie story and make it into a show is amazing
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great way to check the battery and to see how much time is left on it so you know when to re-charge before running out of power,
B00ECK21WO|5.0|If you are going to buy yourself a gift for Christmas make it this box set. The music is just  wonderful. Ever concert is a bit different from the last. Much better sound than the Lark's box set thou that set is very much worthwhile too. Buy it now before it starts going for $500.00 ! treat yourself, I did and am very glad I did. This set goes into my permanent collection.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Great scenes, acting, and true story of Catholic martyrs in South America in the middle 1700's. Great acting by Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons.  Very inspirational !
B003VPWX6K|4.0|Good read, not really a plot but well written and the writer created a world I could imagine and it was enjoyable to read.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I agree with the other reviews which express pleasure with this remixing job.  Rush is my favorite band, and of all their albums Vapor Trails was the one I have listened to the least.  This was largely due to the impenetrable, monolithic muddy sound that plagued this set of songs.  I had the sense that some of these songs were decent, but I would always give up after hearing a few of them due to my weariness with the production.  It was as if Rush was trying to harness the post-grunge trend by intentionally hiding their virtuosity behind a fuzzy wall of sound.<br /><br />So obviously the band recognized that the terrible production on the original Vapor Trails album was an issue for many listeners, and made a correction by offering a new and very different version of the album.  This was a fantastic idea.  The songs now sound crisp, sharp, and distinct from one another.  You can hear each instrument, the vocals are clear, and the songs themselves are much stronger than I remembered.  This has gone from my least listened-to Rush album to one of the ones which I enjoy most.  Easily in the top half of their recordings, this song cycle deals with some painful subject matter in an uplifting manner.  It's probably Neil Peart's most personal set of lyrics and makes a bold and powerful statement about the possibility of recovery from tragedy.  It's also great on a purely musical level, with the band showing that time away did not dull their natural musical connection to one another.  These three virtuosos were still at the top of their game when this album was recorded.<br /><br />I highly recommend this remix to anyone who has avoided the original Vapor Trails album due to its production quality.
B004FHP9KA|2.0|too hard to follow.  good cast and fairly well made but not a good plot.  Can't enjoy a movie that I have to struggle to understand whats going on.  But, my son liked it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the book. I was crying at the end. Very moving. When I go to bed I think of the hunger games
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Awesome voice! I could listen to the all day! Gets you in the Christmas spirit!! Smiles and feeling good! Loved it.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I love the Piano Guys and support them when I can. I buy all of their music. It is my favorite music to listen to everyday. I love to listen to it because it is livelier than traditional classical but without all the nonsense of traditional popular music. I love love LOVE this group!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. I even like it better than candy crush saga, but just by a little.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Great installment to the Pendergast series. As with all the books, the authors did a great job of weaving historical facts into a compelling mystery. LOVED IT!
0679809015|4.0|Very cute I am sure my 23 month old will love it ....only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn't know the book was so small!!!!! It's smaller than the palm of my hand I wasnt expecting that
B00EDX5QNG|5.0|I'm sure that many, like me, were drawn to this album as fans of Nicolas Jaar. His musical sense emphasizes mood, progression, and texture, and none of that signature approach is lost here. I still don't know much about Mr. Harrington and his previous music, but his guitar work fits in seamlessly and brings a bluesier feel to the usually more dance inspired rhythms (a simplistic description) of Jaar's solo works. Jaar plays with the range of his vocals ~sometimes~ sitting somewhere in the territory of Jim Morrison and/or Scott Walker (can't love this aspect enough!), but other times reach pointed falsetto notes; He's not afraid to use his voice as an instrument in the sense that he doesn't sit back on a certain style of singing between the tracks as well as manipulating it electronically, but something that is consistent is his haunting delivery. I love how the tracks grow as they move along. There's nothing stagnant about this album. Darkside continue to challenge your ears with Psychic even more so than they did with their self-titled 3 track EP. This is among my favorites of 2013, which is shaping into a very pleasing year with Mariam the Believer's Blood Donation, Oneohtrix Point Never's R Plus Seven, and Kurt Vile's Wakin on a Pretty Daze, just to name a few.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get this app, you will love it! If you like subway surfers, this app is just for you! It's just like subway surfers. But you do the world's in this app more than once when you go through them. AWESOME APP,GET IT NOW!!!!!
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|This music brings a fullness in my soul that expresses the joy of what Christmas is all about. So refreshing!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is SO welcome in that IT IS DONE IN A VERY, VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF WRITING! From beginning to end-one wants<br />to know the truth of the story but tis not forthcoming.  nor is much of a backgroound story on his wife,  we don't really understand anything much of her previous life - which I believe would have made a most welcome addition to the story line.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|it's top gun! let's be honest.  Classic all the way.  I grew up having to listen to my Dad blast the dolby to have the walls rumbling.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Several workouts to select from depending on how much time you have and what part of the body needs to be &#34;worked.&#34;
B00EI4V3X2|1.0|Great sound but they don't have a chat volume button. So no matter how much I love them for sound for games I can't handle everyone being so loud.. Even when I turned the chat down to 1 people still seemed really loud.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is a highly irreverent and comical romp through the countryside with a hilarious little green man and his unprepared and surprised cohorts!  I fell in love with this story the first time I watched it and had to own it!  The characters will keep you laughing all the way to the exciting end!  Don't miss the final minutes as the credits begin to scroll; you'll surely regret it!
B0000013G9|1.0|Did not have TLC's CD in the case. The Cd was of someone I never heard of. How does that happen?
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|A quite unique and fresh collection of short stories artfully combining sci-fi and fantasy whilst keeping that human earthly quality of ambition, drive, corruption and love. The characters are well forged and complex adding colour to plots full of energy, twists and turns. The first story REWIND, with its two regular Italian men climbing up their ladder of success, held me captive and all subsequent stories offered the same fascination. It is quite difficult to captivate an audience with short stories but I must say that Rossi did this with ease and flair. I loved this collection of short stories and the vivid and exciting worlds they immersed me in.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I belong to a book club and no one liked the book.  The story line was hard to follow and confusing,
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Great read; I bought five of his previous books after reading this one.  I love his humor and the way he weaves his tales.<br />I read Gold Coast ten years ago, now reading the Gate House, and can't get enough.  J. Suverkrup
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game especially the lil quests to complete rooms and add friends to trade things. Also love the chests boosters and live chat with other players
B000268QB2|4.0|Keane is one of the best and most underrated bands out there right now and this is perhaps their best CD.  If you've heard  'Somewhere Only We Know' and enjoyed it.  Take a chance on the whole thing.  I doubt you will be disappointed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Super fun game great graphics. Runs flawlessly on both my Kindle HDX, and my Droid RZAR M. Best free app I ever purchased. Unlike some other reviews I have read never once was I asked to rate the app, or never bothered by any glitches or problems. Great game. Great app.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun and addicting. A lot of different animals and different things to do. U won't be bored. Check it out and have fun.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|I really love this screwdriver since I'm a crazy doctor who's fan, but sadly the screwdriver came with imperfections before I even opened the package, such as scratches and dents, and even paint splatter on certain parts of the screwdriver where it shouldnt be. Notably on the silver rings near the grayband of the screwdriver. On a personal level I give this 4 stars, because I love this toy so much, its such great fun, but in terms of quality, I give this 3 stars. I just want to be honest on what you maybe getting. If you're really serious about owning prop version of this, I suggest looking for the universal remote of the tenth doctor screwdriver. But if you're looking for something to play with and have fun messing around, this isnt too bad. I still recommend this, just becareful in how you handle this toy since it is plastic. And also the last two sounds of the sonic screwdriver, doesnt sound like its from the show. Hope this review helps. Allonsy ( ;
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Det Pendergast<br /><br />Had been waiting for our Det to return. As always a good story Pendergast is always a good read he is recovering in his own way but hes back in the game.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Another awesome game to beat the winter cold and boredom Might have to fight my kid for my own kindle
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this ME and my husband compete And fight to beat levels. We love it.  The great game. My kids love it as well.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|It was good for a remake. I still think the first one was better. I am glad they went with a different story line and leaves it open for another movie
B000T433CO|5.0|Best movie EVER!!!  I watch this movie every year around the holidays since is came out!  I absolutely love it more every time I see it!
B000IVW25M|5.0|This movie is  a classic and a must have. great price and the product was in good condition. I'm happy with this purchase
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Check out James' blog. If you llike that, you will love this book.  His personality cracks me up as he serves a variety of insight, wisdom, and authenticity.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Maybe the beat live album ever.  Blows me and anyone who listens to the quality Ian's . Could've done without Moby Dick.  Best
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock is very a successful update of Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock is of course a genius, and also a pretty young man, obnoxious and occasionally cruel.  He is much more lovable and hateable than any previous portrayals.  The portrayal of Watson is novel too:  He is a real person, albeit one damaged in just the right way to make for a great partnership.  If you've enjoyed SH through the original books, TV shows, and movies you will absolutely love this Sherlock.  Holmes & Watson are updated while maintaining the essence of their characters and their relationship.  Our only complaint about Sherlock is that Season 1 consists just three episodes.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|I liked this film. The tender moments between the brothers would soften anyone's heart. Their feelings of love for each other made me wish that everyone could have this same experience [not necessarily with a sibling]. The two men who play the brothers are absolutely gorgeous [Tomas looked liked he was the model for the David statue and the actor who played the other brother looked like the South American version of Bradley Cooper], although I wish they looked more similar to make their relationship more believable. Otherwise, at times I felt that I was looking at two, unrelated gay men being together. I was also a little disappointed that the actual relationship wasn't explored more: how did the sexual relationship begin, why they were so drawn to each other, character development, etc. What sort of conflict would arise between the parents when they learned of their sons' unusual relationship? The background music in some of the tender scenes was a bit too sappy for me, but it still affected me. Overall, I would recommend this film; although to which market group I'm not absolutely sure. Gay men more than likely.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game might be the best game ever since the first temple run I can't believe how fun it was. I can't get past vector on level one spoiler alert
B00EEXST2K|4.0|The acting was good, the actors in it were good, but the whole story-line was not as inspiring as I hoped it would be. It's a rental.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I tried this game after so much talk!  I like it okay even though I always end up getting stuck at the same spot.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome bingo game. I can play thus game for hours if I had enough credits and all.Lol  what are you waiting for, download this game now.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fantastic book! Very well written, kept me engaged. Not your typical &#34;zombie apocalypse&#34; book, for those who feel saturated by the Zombie genre. I wish it were longer.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I have it on my Nintendo ds and I like it on there but it's soooo much better on my Kindle.  Great graphics
0804137501|5.0|No rocket science, but a valuable -easy to read- pragmatic collection of a real company's experiences. Makes you jealous ;) Thanks for sharing!
B003ZDNWOA|5.0|Having just read the fascinating Emperor of Scent by Chandler Burr, I was curious to read more about Luca Turin. Despite not always agreeing with his critique of some fragrances, I was enchanted by his love  and obvious passion for all things fragrant. A must have for any lover of beautiful fragrance.  I hope he and Tania Sanchez update their guide in a couple of years time - she is a perfect foil and is as delightfully irreverent at times.
B009H1S56O|5.0|Beautiful packaging, shipping was awesome and the songs are all there! I absolutely love this deluxe box set and purchased this on Valentines Day, hah didn't know until I checked XD. I noticed people saying that they were missing tracks, but I guess since I ordered this later they must have fixed the problem.<br />[I paid $50.40 for this + tax was about $64.00]<br /><br />BTD:15 songs<br /><br />BTD:PE 8 songs
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Used to play on my old computer, and missed the game on newer ones. This is even better than it used to be.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Truly a Masterpiece Classic. The costuming,  the settings, and the acting, are all glorious. Watching each episodee is like reading chapters of a novel.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|Loved this book. Its like having your very own personal life coach at the reach of your hand. Would definitely recommend for its highly valuable content
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great for long car rides because you do not need wifi for it yo work. you also have a lot of game choices to choose from. I have not had any problems with this game
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this movie ...although it was in existence years before I was born ..this is the what Christmas is....
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Decent action rpg. Hack slash blast your way towards your levels and play with friends. Enjoy it as you you will.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Very unexpected, but great ending to a great season. Absolutely fell in love with this series. I have recommended it to everyone that hasn't seen it!
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This is a really good book. I will recommend it to teens<br /> Love it so much. Read it now!!!!!<br />Amazing
B00FY2TQMW|5.0|I love the f&f movies. The story line has always been far fetched, but it always delivers hot cars, hot women, and plenty of action. It was never ment to be non-fiction. Just satisfying to the eyes!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft and I have a city already built and I have been only playing for about a half a year
B00EH486AQ|3.0|The swords/saws that came with the action figure are very cheap and break quickly. Good for a kid but definitely overpriced. Also pretty small. It's 7&#34; which is stated in the title and description of the product but thats another negative.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Best game ever for a few  game. Hours of intense fun love Dc and the characters! Definitely a game worth down loading
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's okay. Too many ads and always asking you to purchase something. You loose lives and have to wait for the game to regenerate your lives. Not really a fan.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|God this game really hooks you. I had someone sneakily looking over my shoulder whilst I was playing it in a hospital waiting room. After a while he could no longer hi<br />de his interest and asked me what the game was called so that he could buy it.  I bet he's hooked by now too!
0553266306|5.0|The day of the Jackal is a good story about a calculating assassin (the Jackal) who's assigned to assassinate President de Gualle of France. The book is well-written, plot driven, tour de force that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next. I enjoyed this book immensely.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING GAME I HAVE PLAYED ON MY TA6let it's so awesome and the tragica are fixing sic
0743297334|5.0|Ernest Hemingway is without a doubt one of the great writers. When I was reading the book, I was transported to the time and place that the characters occupied via the dialog, setting and descriptive narrative, which was a post-World War I generation in Paris. It is a story about people (Jake and Brett) vs. plot.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I love this application on my Kindle.  It makes it very easy to transfer things between the device and my laptop.  I would highly recommend it
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The book is a fast moving good read. The characters are interesting. They provide an intriguing mix of personalities and dimensions.
1936608898|5.0|I can't stop going back to this book because it is filled with so much good information and helpful tips.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I was sceptical at first but this is not only addictive but challenging from race to race. Very easy to learn but tough to master, plenty of upgrades and the graphics are smooth also.  Try it, you will like it .
B005PK553C|5.0|Awesome series - I seriously didn't want it to end.  If you like mystery, spooky, unique, intense type of shows than you should definitely watch this, you won't be disappointed.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Great movie/dvd for my daughter who loves One Direction.  These boys sure do know how to sing and interact with the audience, not only in person, but on the DVD as well.
0385528787|2.0|A disappointing end to a fascinating trilogy.  It's remarkably lacking in conflict, and moreover doesn't bother to explore the motivations behind the cataclysm that underlies the events of the book.  I was really hoping for much more after the excellent &#34;Year of the Flood.&#34;
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Extremely useful app. It allows you to place warning beacons at various battery levels. It gives you indications of how long it's going to take to charge up and ( for the geeky) loads more.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Nice game, but after one quick round, you have to buy more lives.  I don't want to Have to Buy anything to play the game...
160774418X|3.0|While some of the ingredients and recipes are unique and interesting, of the 280 pages in this book 125 are dedicated to baking, pastry & desserts. Which would be fine, except I'm not looking to bake.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Although I wish this mouse was wireless, it is awesome!! For the price, I highly recommend it, you can't go wrong.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I thought the plot was repetitious and plodding. The ending was predictable. The book seemed like it was written as a screen play.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|she is starting to return to her early novels-more about plot than the dysfunctional friendships that the main players have had in the more recent books. She is letting Lucy be happy.
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|The game was fun although I did have to skip a couple mini games. Overall I liked it. G5 has some of the best games out there. I think I've bought them all. Lol.
B0087FMUCQ|1.0|Why does a golf game need access to your network info, your WiFi info and the contents of your usb memory.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Even though the band has been around for a while this album is totally fresh and worth checking out, a must buy
B00G21YLF6|5.0|Love the background information.  But the best parts are mini episodes, together with the Day of the Doctor.  Love Paul McGann in the The Night of the Doctor, and the entire Day of the Doctor was brilliant.  Really!
1451666179|5.0|As a long time fan of her blog I was compelled to purchase her book.  Even if I did not like it ( I did like) I felt that I owed her the ten dollars and more for the hours entertainment and insight she had given her blog followers.  BTW ironically Its too late to appologize came on while writing this review (fans of blog will know what I am refering to).  Ms Brosh gives word and picture to what is going on inside of herself and it is eerily similar to what many  of us experience but do not know how to put it to voice/paper.  Way to go Allie!  I give the book two thumbs up!
B00846F1YW|5.0|Easy to use,  cute story line. I like that you don't have to post to FB or twitter when you finish a level. Also has lots of natural places to take breaks at.
B004X75RK4|4.0|It was exactly what I was looking for... light and entertaining.  Another great Sandra Bullock movie.  I watched it with my parents and we all enjoyed it.
B001EP8EL2|5.0|Very freaky movie and too slow and cryptic for some I'm sure but it's supposed to be a classic and it definitely transports you to a different time a place.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A brilliant story about a young girl growing up in 1939 in Hitler's Germany. The characters are superbly written...so realistic that you will feel you knew them personally by the end of the book. A must read especially before the movie!
B002VECLVY|5.0|Totally cool movie!  I've watched it over and over and can't get enough.  Sad but so beautiful it's like time stops when it's playing.  It really seems like it was made 50 years ago because the period fashions and architecture etc are so perfect.
B00G70K1HY|5.0|Love the comic action movies plus my kids will sit and watch them with me. This was one of my favorite for 2013 lots of action with a good story line that keeps you watching.
0802473156|5.0|This is a book not just for couples, but for understanding anybody that is a friend or family member. Understanding how they receive and perceive love is worth the price of the book and the time to absorb it. The biggest lesson to draw from it is that you need to go beyond intending to do well, and actually find out how they best receive what you are communicating, and then use what works.
0300197187|4.0|I rated \\"A little History of the World\\" 4.5 stars because we really enjoy this history version. I purchased the audio first and waited until the newly published illustrated version was released, so I can not compare it to older publications.<br /><br /> I love that the illustrations featured in this release are real life pictures and not children's fluffed version of cartoons. I would prefer a slightly larger print for easier reading through. My son enjoys this and we often listen to the audio book in the car and have learned so much already. It's like having a grandfather or favorite uncle read to us or tell us a story about history!
1401307450|5.0|Addiction runs heavy in my family, and for the life of me I could never understand why my loved ones would constantly go back to the lifestyle. A friend of mine recommended this book, and I was blown away.<br />The brutality of Anthony's addiction was so unreal to me. It honestly gave me a firsthand look into how drugs affect your mind, life and family. The gruesome details were not spared which I actually sympathized with, he is a good person just stuck between a rock and a hard place.<br />You would assume some one so talented had training and a strict lifestyle but this is completely the opposite. Not only was his childhood somewhat broken, but it wasn't an easy road as an adult either. His teen years were most upsetting to me, why his father allowed a child so young into that scene, I will never understand. For reasons like that, I couldn't put this book down.  It’s amazing how he directed his misfortune into music that people all over the world cherish.<br />This book is a real eye opener, it gives you a personal look into a dangerous world that some people manage to survive.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I love period movies and this one is fabulous . Still haven't watched all episode s but I plan to.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I have tried several games and this one is just okay, I am not impressed, others seem to like it a lot, but it does not really do anything for me.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Cornwell makes you part of the book, always guessing and always amazed.  Great  Suspense novel. Her knowledge and research makes this a good read
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I heard about this book like a hundred years after everyone else from a friend. I thought I would skip it, I am ecstatic I did not. It was amazing, I read the entire thing in one sitting I couldn't put it down. I also ran the entire gambit of human emotion. Fully recommended!
B00GIZO674|5.0|I had this on my PC years ago. I love it on my Kindle Fire HD. The improvements are wonderful!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|NICE GAME I really enjoy playing at it. It is worth the try. Good luck. Even . My children love this game
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. All of it. The story line and the raw emotion between the characters is astonishing. I plan on re reading before the movie comes out.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|From a technical aspect, this movie is stunning, from the visuals, sounds, and score (great score by M83).  I have to give kudos to the sound engineers for making the vocal distinct, from low to high levels of sound.  I hate movies that blast you with volume while vocals are low and hard to hear.<br /><br />The bluray version of this movie will definitely showcase a good home theater setup.<br /><br />The only ding, and a disappointing ding for me (and hence the lack of a 5 star technical review), is that the True Dolby HD isolated score is staticy and drops out on my setup.  Searching around, it appears I am not the only person that has experienced this problem.  I have a Sony S790 BD player with dual HDMI output (one to my receiver and one to my TV).  It is possible the problem is not disc related, but have not had the time to do more experimentation.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed, and liked it more after a repeat viewing.  Repeated viewings give you better appeciation of the technical aspects of the movie along with character reactions (especially Julia, played by Olga Kurylenko) in certain scenes.  Although Tom Cruise does his best in real-life to make you hate him personally, he does an acceptable acting job.<br /><br />The movie does have some predictability in the plot and shades of other past sci-fi movies, but not everything is explicitly explained (especially the motives of the alien), requiring the viewer to figure things out on their own (which I like).  If you are a serious sci-fi fan, and if you take some time to readup on some of the insights of the film makers, you may gain a greater appreciation of the movie.
B004A7OQKY|4.0|I thought this was  a pretty good workout, but could have used more core work. I did some more on my own afterwards. Also the video is shot at her home, which is kind of funny, but it doesn't really matter. It works because most women will probably use this video at home- so it's realistic! I should add, I am about 22 weeks and she is clearly further along than me, so I think this workout will be perfect for when I'm even bigger!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it.  I like waking up to a sound I chose.  The alarms are so easy to create or delete as needed.  I especially like that I can set up an alarm one time for multiple weekdays.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I was on the fence, since this is a CW show, but it is great.  Even if you are not into DC comics its a great show to follow!
B008M87GJK|2.0|Too difficult format for easy navigating.  I have to turn my tablet in a direction I'm not comfortable with.  The format is wierd with three rows of linear headlines and you end up reading the wrong story.  It's just too fancy.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|But I love the way that you can play and your time will fly by. It's fun n everyone can play it as well but crateful you don't get hooked
B00CUG8GAS|5.0|Difficult to get through at times when she graphically depicts loosing her I kings, the way humans and animals are tortured and killed. But there are so many frank and humorous occasions also. Really enjoyed the book in the end.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Kevin Spacey is in his element here in this dark comedy and drama.  He plays a father who isn't living a life congruent to his values - so he gets distracted by his daughter's friend.  Annette Benning plays a woman ruled by appearances.  I asked a shrink once if people like that existed and he indicated they are pretty common.  This movie highlights what happens, in a darkly comic way, when you are living a life that doesn't fit you.  It's a cautionary tale, told in a humorous and tragic way with beautiful images, and will compel you to move in the direction of what matters to you.  You will want to create a life that fits. 4.5 stars
0761172726|5.0|This is my favorite calendar & I get it every year.  It is a must have for anyone with kids.
1476729085|5.0|Okay, this is the funniest book I have ever read.  It's funny smart.  The set up is brilliant: Professor Don Tillman is autistic, perhaps a tad OCD and looking for love.  The problem is he doesn't think he can fall in love and women don't find his quirks lovable.  What to do?  Create a science project of sorts, design a questionnaire for women, do research and conduct experiments.<br /><br />In analyzing what makes this book so amusing, the character of genetics professor Don Tillman narrates his observations of what he THINKS is happening and folks are feeling in situations which he encounters.  But we, the readers, know what's really going on based on his observations.  We are simultaneously amused by Don's antics and feel sympathy for him.  We get to inhabit his eccentric and brilliant mind and what a joy ride that is.  You don't know whether to envy or pity him.<br /><br />The author puts Don in environments ripe for mayhem for a socially challenged man: a gay bar, a 5-star restaurant, a faculty party....you get the idea.<br /><br />Will Don meet the woman of his scientific fantasies?  Does she even exist?  And what about the Rosie, the smoking, cussing barmaid?  Is Don destined to dance forever with a skeleton for a partner - don't ask, just read.<br /><br />This book is on my top ten favorite novels list.  Great for book groups when you want a break from the usual lyrical-evocative-tragic combination platter.  Just read with no expectations, and you'll probably be delighted if you like unconventional and aberrant fun.  Looking forward to the movie version.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the greatest Christmas movies of my generation and maybe the best Lampoon's vacation movie. Just finished a theater room and was a must have on Blu-Ray.
B00BIK06JG|3.0|I can't figure out how to attach the strap so I can use it.  Very minimal directions included.  Once I figure it out, I think it will be a good case.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|Except for the first part of this movie, which was pretty exciting...the rest was a huge disappointment.  We expected a much better movie when the start was Denzel Washington.  Didn't enjoy seeing him as a drunk - druggie at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the challenge of this game,but it takes to long to move from one challenge at a time 24 hours is to long.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Even though it was a movie, I didn't like the plot focusing on the possibly that some of our pilots could be drunk and high on cocaine while flying our commercial planes. How scary to think that might happen. I was happy how it ended with the pilot confessing, him owning up to his mistakes, and then paying a price for those mistakes.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Ahhhhhh, this has me so engaged eh!!! lol, Sorry for the Trini (Trinidad & tobago) twang. I absolutely love it!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The gameplay is great and there are a lot of options. However the video ads make the game freeze a lot.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Great story, Not a Pendergast only, A strong female character to get behind in future books....Congrats Guts another great book....
B00CH3DBNQ|2.0|While the subject is absolutely phenomenal, the writing style is spotty and hard to read. Certainly fell short of my expectations.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|THE very best of the series , it held me spellbound from G to P!  To find enough new and completely different stunts for Tom et al.to take on  makes me think there could be many more sequels to Ethan's story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|These are the best of the best. Wish the one who sent them on the mission was just 1/10th as qualified in his job.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I was skeptical about downloading this game because I was afraid that I would only be able to play for a certain amount of time before I would have to buy the full version. I love games like this and I will definitely one looking for me!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Authors of this class just can't be beat.  Puts so many other present-day wannabes in the dust.  There was such an innocence found in the &#34;old&#34; books.  sigh...
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The free daily tournament reward is 10 credits. The difficulty of winning this is extremely high so the reward doesn't match the difficulty level. Also, seems to be a lot of issues with the game, like not giving you rewards, missing credits. The high stakes tournament increases the shadows you will get during play by the number of days in a row you have played. I have played every day this week and I am still stuck on day 1. It takes forever to get a response from support because there are so many issues from the game. Then when you do get some one, they say there was no problem according the their records. They do not compensate for what you may have lost during a play issue. You have a low amount of credit you are able to collect daily. I collect 79/day plus I can collect 5 credits from friends. No need to invite more friends to play with you because you can't collect more credits. Cost to play 4 cards is 40 credits so I can play 2 rounds a day. Not fun anymore. I like the game, the graphics are great. Just wish there were more daily credits available and there were less gaming issues.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Amazon has provided great customer service.  And I love this CD!  the first 3 songs are awesome!  don't really care about the last one though.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Much slower than the first two, but I actually thought she sewed up more than I expected in the last ten chapters. Worth a read for fans of first two, but not nearly the book divergent was.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This is such a cute game! Our boy loves building the animals that go with each letter. It's a fun way for him to learn his alphabet. Each letter has basically the same games, but there is enough variation to keep it enjoyable and interesting. Super cute and fun educational app.
B0095G5AFU|1.0|Why does this app need access to my accounts that are on my phone and tablet??? That is an absurd permission...Not happening. I will find another app that can do the same thing without being so invasive!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pretty easy to start playing.... good graphics so far I have been able to play without spending actual cash. Good game
0385737955|5.0|I really enjoyed “The Maze Runner.” Uniqueness ranks high on my list when judging a book, and this one has it in spades. From the first chapter where Thomas ascends the elevator into the Glade I was intrigued. Where was the author going to take me next?  What strange things would I see here?<br /><br />Plus there were lots of mysteries to solve. Why were the children in the Glade? What is the maze about? What are the Grievers? And just when I thought I was getting some answers, the author threw another mystery into the mix—new twists in the game. I also liked the Glade-native swear words. It was quite creative, and a nice way to keep the story accessible to any age.<br /><br />I didn’t have a real problem with the characterization. Though I can see where some might think they lacked depth, much of that was due to the premise of the story. If the characters don’t know who they are initially, how can we? We have to learn the little bits and slices as they do. A few characters did blend in my mind (specifically Newt and Alby) so they probably could’ve used a bit more differentiation. But, in general, I thought they were quite good. I truly wanted to see how they’d get out of it all…IF they’d get out of it all.<br /><br />I think the only negative I had in the book was one place where it felt like I was getting too much information too fast. After so many pages of small drips, it felt like a waterfall. That was a small thing, though, and I’m quite pleased with how the book turned out. Just when I thought I had it figured out...whammo..and then whammo again.<br /><br />I highly recommend “The Maze Runner.” Lots of fun.
B002EXEGTW|4.0|It's a nice movie! You don't end up sleeping or bored. Normally, when I watched movies like this, I ended turning it off but apollo 13 is a nice movie.
B00003XB8K|5.0|Loved it....Perfect for relaxation... meditation.... back ground music....easy to sleep to.... easy to work to....oh, and did I mention.... I loved it.
B00H2UFHBI|5.0|Outview (Book 1):<br /><br />What a spectacular ride! The story starts off strong as the reader experiences one of Nathan's outviews, where he is forced to endure different horrible deaths. As the book moves along, we learn about Nathan's troubled home life. His father died, and his brother was locked up in a mental institution. Now Nathan fears he is losing his mind just like his brother. But then he begins to learn the truth about what has happened to his family and what is happening to himself. And he discovers more about the world than he ever thought possible.<br /><br />I am a skeptic, one of those people who can only believe in what can be seen. Yet, as I read this, I found myself beginning to wonder and believe. What if there is more to the physical world than what we realize? I was captivated by all of the concepts, particularly reincarnation. That is an idea that has always fascinated me, even though I doubt that it is anything more than just a theory.<br /><br />I loved the cast of characters, especially Nathan's loyal friends, who continue to help him even when it becomes very dangerous for them. The writing was fluid, and the imagery was beautiful and vividly depicted. I was easily pulled into the story, and each page kept me wanting to read more. It was addictive and compelling.<br /><br />This is a highly imaginative and unique book. I look forward to reading the next one!<br /><br />Outin (Book 2):<br /><br />The spectacular ride that began in Outview continues in Outin, and it becomes even more exhilarating. Nate is still being hunted by Lightyear, and he is faced with predictions of horrifying events for the future that he must try to prevent. The future is constantly changing with every decision, and his life and the lives of many others, including his friends', depend upon the choices they make.<br /><br />Nate also enters Outin for the first time, an amazing different dimension that is unlike anything you could ever imagine existing in our physical world. It is truly breathtaking. Legg uses words to paint a magnificent picture of Outin just as he does when describing the beauty that is on earth in our dimension.<br /><br />With the help of mystics and others in the Inner Movement, Nate tries to escape the grasp of Lightyear, while attempting to plan out how they can take it down. The story is intense, and there are some unexpected events and surprising revelations. Meanwhile, Nate is discovering more soul powers and is learning more about his past lives that may help the Inner Movement. And I kept wondering who Nate is meant to be with: Amber or Linh? Personally, I've been hoping it's Linh...<br /><br />The most pressing theme that I noticed in this book asks the question: can evil be stopped without using violence? In the real world, I don't believe that is possible. But perhaps, in Nate's world, it is.<br /><br />I am dying to know what is going to happen in the next book!<br /><br />Outmove (Book 3):<br /><br />This is the third novel in the Inner Movement series. Lightyear was just a division of Omnia, and in this book, we find out more about Omnia and how evil and powerful they really are and have been throughout history. I was eager to read this to see whether or not Nate and his allies would be able to defeat Omnia. There were so many odds against them. What makes things even worse for them is the Inner Force, a faction of the Inner Movement, who believes that violence is the only way to stop Omnia. In many ways, they are almost as dangerous as Omnia itself.<br /><br />Omnia has taken over, and people are being unjustly imprisoned, sent away, and killed. There are some horrifying moments in this story, particularly when Nate visits another dimension called Carst. As with the last two books, there are several exciting scenes that will keep you glued to the pages.<br /><br />So many questions that you have probably had since the beginning of the series will be answered in this book. I kept wondering what exactly the Jadeo was and who Nate was really meant to be with.... And if you were curious about the dark mystic, then you will finally get to meet him.<br /><br />This is a really fascinating series that does not disappoint. If you have already read the first two books, you definitely won't want to miss reading this one!
B001DUJNGS|5.0|Loved it....Perfect for relaxation... meditation.... back ground music....easy to sleep to.... easy to work to....oh, and did I mention.... I loved it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|So many choices that you're sure to find something that works, and I like that you can adjust the volume of each sound.  I finally found the right combination of rain/wind chimes that lulls me straight to sleep, and I stay that way until the alarm goes off.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|If you have the PS3 or Xbox version of Injustice GET THIS APP!!!  (Be aware that the Wi does NOT support this app's features).  It does take a lo g time to download and it does take a lot of space ( it says 2.5GB but I think it's closer to 4) but it totally worth the time and effort.
B000FC12ZA|4.0|I learned about a life style I had never envisioned.  I love to learn about people and how they live.  We are all so different and our cultures are interesting.  Fiction or truth I enjoyed the read and found myself questioning some things in my own life and how useful and they are to me.
B003NFM3JU|1.0|No one in my family enjoyed this movie. Very Boring. 3D effects were not impressive. Hard to interpret what each ghost was saying. Waste of money.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Love this CD! It's totally chill and not like anything they have done before.! It is defintely worth the purchase especially to get the cover album which is 3D
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun and a good time killer. I just wish there was a way to make money quicker and expanding vaults wasn't such a pain. They really push to get you to buy with real money
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|iT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE ! IT TURNED EVERYTHING WE LEARNED UPSIDE DOWN.. VERY WELL WRITEN AND INFORMATIVE AND MOTIVATING.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Both books were unbelievable! I cannot say I have a favorite. He really draws in the reader. Please make a book  three, four and five. I will admit I do not like to read, but this is one of the books that I have read in a short amount of time because I just can't stop once I start!
B007TK77QE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I love anything set in England and could picture the little town the book was set in. All the families had their twists and turns and real life was exposed as all wanted to fill &#34; the vacancy&#34;. Beautifully written as only J K Rowling knows how to!
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Songs are so beautiful.  This will put you in the Christmas spirit for sure ! A must for Christmas !
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|I've been looking forward to the Android release of this game!  I've been salivating for it for a year since I saw the trailer for the iOS version, and here it is!  I enjoy the look, the management, and the tongue-in-cheek story and character of the game.  Happy to say I've had zero stability issues on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />It's not without its issues, unfortunately.  My tactical crew are always highly leveled since they seem to gain XP through operating weapons systems as well as repelling boarders, and the science crew get it from healing injured crew, but my engineers are always sadly underpowered and lag way behind the level curve.  I think that crew need more ways to earn XP, namely through routine systems operation--including the bridge crew.<br /><br />I like the division of labor between the three types and find it appropriate, but the assignment mechanic is asinine.  When I need a crewer to pick up a blaster or welder and deal with an emergency, they have to first trek all the way across the ship to report to duty station before their destination changes?  In practice, it hobbles response and contributes to the length of battles.<br /><br />Combat time can also be overlong, as multiple reviews have pointed out already.<br /><br />TL;DR: Fun game, could be a fantastic game with some improvements in balance and mechanics.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|What happen to something interesting happening every chapter?  To a pace that left me unable to put the books down?  To needing to spend every moment eating them up till I was finished, often in just a few sittings.  I miss the first three books -- my favorite books of all time.  This book only had a few chapters that equal thier greatness...  The rest feels a bit like filler.  Still overall I think I enjoyed this book more than the last (Fiest).
B005V2S7FW|4.0|works fine on my PC. Tried downloading for my Blackberry phone - unable to locate. No idea where it was sent.
B00G6YH6G0|3.0|Use of Nineteenth century style fits the setting but makes the story telling stilted, takes away from the drama and intrigue. Clearly an accomplished writer with great skills.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nice book I also saw the movie and it was very good because it had a lot of great action
B00DJWV11I|3.0|A pleasant read with some laugh out loud moments. This story read to me like a long-ish magazine article or a rom-com script, it was quick, the tone of the writing was light, witty with as many movie and pop-culture references as could be stuffed in, which kept bringing me out of the story that was supposed to be about love, I think. It was like a long internal conversation, being the narrative of the hero as things happen. I did not find this book romantic at all, it was predictable and fairly monotonous, there were really no highs or lows here.<br />Once I passed the first chapter, I realized that it was more about the philosophy of Drew's life which was all about sex and instant gratification, yet told with a sense of humour. Although he seemed to have good female role models in his life, he treated women with a fair amount of disdain, which is what happens when you live a charmed life with endless wealth and opportunity. Kate was forgettable so the romance did not work for me, I have to like the heroine for the romance to work.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Just an okay game. Wish someone would create a game that is just fun to play, and not frustrating after only a few levels.  I know there are people who just love challenges, but I just want to have fun and be entertained.
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|This is the best anti-malware that protects my computers.  It's free and has found lots of viruses on my computer.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|awesome CD. I think the one before this was SLIGHTLY better, but this one is still a winner. do it.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|It did not keep my interest.  It was just not the right kind of humour. my husband and I were very disappointed.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It was a very good read. Better that I expected. The forward is well worth skipping over it is to yawn for.
B00C5R8364|5.0|As always great writing, thorough research and you get hooked from the first to the last page.....This one may be one of his best!!!
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Another great Motorhead release, from classic heavy stuff to the blues, well worth it.<br />And why do I need to put a certain number of words in a review, that is really stupid!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This story ending the trilogy was fascinating.  The characters emotional and brave. It brings the question how can they have a normal life after the. Trials of the hunger games.  Time will tell through their children.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|Saw the movie over thanksgiving weekend with my sisters and my little niece.  And have to admit it's the first Real Disney film I've enjoyed for a long time.  Loved it so much I had to get the soundtrack.  This digital version of the 2 disk set has some of the best songs and some great bonus tracks of demos songs that didn't make the final cut of the film.  Best tracks to listen are Track 1- Frozen Heart, Track 2- Do you want to build a Snowman, Track 3- For the First Time in Forever, Track 5- Let it Go and Track 7- In Summer is a cute and funny song to listen to.
0316227706|5.0|Beautiful photography! Colorful, amazing! There are several dozen dogs featured of all varieties. The dogs look like little underwater aliens.I bought the book as a gift but decided to order another and keep one for myself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grand kids love this game! From 3-7 years and they all are challenged yet play well. They are much better than grandma!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book, as everyone knows, is extremely popular. Now I can see why. I'm not sure why I can relate to katniss, perhaps it's because of the extreme amount of love for family. I would recommend this to anyone (although not for children) as I finished it in one night.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game---very addictive<br />Play-you will love it--you might get stuck on some levels but if If I can do it;~so can you!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|outstanding book, well written and brutally honest. the music of RHCP is deeply intertwined with the band's personal struggles and heartbreaks. after i read this book i never heard a RHCP song the same way, particularly their older stuff. also, keidis doesn't hold back on his struggles with addiction, which i found particularly interesting.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was a wonderful book, held my attention, spent every possible second reading, really interesting plot, great sense of characters. It really forced one to examine that sense of right and wrong through the character development. It is a very good book and I would recommend to anyone.
B00FVZJYK6|4.0|They used some scenes from the first movie!!!<br />I suppose they wanted to save a few bucks.....<br />Good enough movie anyway
B002VECM4A|5.0|I purchased this for my personal enjoyment and ended up using this movie as an educational tool for your teenage girls.
B005DD7TI0|5.0|Great movie with an intriguing concept, along with the responsibilities & consequences. I would have liked the movie to have been longer to delve deeper into the idea and how others may corrupt it (touched on by the DeNiro character). But you can certainly see the potential for sequels, as long as they're serious and don't make them silly. As far as sequels go, you can also see this become a variation of the 'Bourne' series, where the conflicts & battles are intellectual chess games, rather than blood & guts brawls.<br /><br />It's also nice to see an original idea brought to film instead of another retread or remake.
B001992NUQ|5.0|great movie and even better as a gift. played well and was brand new.  great if you are into blu rays
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Whoa. Great continuation of A Time To Kill. I was not sure it would live up to the first book but it defiantly did.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|great movie and even better as a gift. played well and was brand new.  great if you are into blu rays
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|This is a rather complicated novel with many characters involved; twelve plus, and there are back stories to all of them that are sometimes hard to keep track of unless you concentrate hard.  Also, it has an astrological framework with references that may not be clear to every reader.  I found that by the middle of the book I finally became engaged in the plot and it moved much more swiftly.  The character development is excellent in and of itself.
1400052181|5.0|The non-fiction novel by Rebecca Skloot, “The immortal life of Henrietta Lacks” is the most gripping and eye opening book that I have ever read. From the beginning, to the end, I could not put this book down.  After I finished, I spent countless hours on the web searching topics related to Henrietta’s family and the infamous HeLa cells.<br />  Henrietta Lacks, an African -American woman, mother of five children, had cervical cancer and was diagnosed and treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1951. The novel describes the use of Henrietta’s cells, without her knowledge or consent, for the purpose of conducting research.  This research led to the most prominent advances in medical science over the past 62 years. Henrietta’s cells, called HeLa cells, led to vaccines for polio, rabies, smallpox, and measles. Likewise, HeLa cells have contributed to the production of treatments for leukemia, breast cancer, and colon cancer. It was not until 20 years after her death that the family learned of the use of her cells in research.  Neither Henrietta, nor her family, was ever compensated for the contribution her cells gave to medical science. Consider: the HeLa cell line has led to advances in gene mapping, cloning and many other important medical therapies, too numerous to mention. As a result, the medical and pharmaceutical industries have benefited in enormous profits.<br /> Skloot recounts two opposing stories: the pain and anguish of Henrietta Lacks and her family, and the historical account of how the medical establishment use her cells for conducting scientific research. The interactions with a health care team who demonstrated a dominating perception that advances in science were paramount over Henrietta’s right to dignified health care. In the Lacks family’s case, Skloot points out that it seems morally unacceptable that despite the billions in profits made on the HeLa cell line the family still has no health insurance.  The moral and ethical issues raisedin the book are astounding and alarming. Some of those issues have implications that will ultimately affect all of us in the future of genetic research.<br />As I said, this is the most amazing book I have read and highly recommend it for your next Best Read.<br /> A Startling & Compelling Read!!!!
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|Well written as always.  This book is not strictly an Agent Pendergast book and not as spellbinding as some of the earlier novels.  That's understandable since I've heard that this story line is coming to a close.  There are still a lot of questions we don't have answers for and a lot of mystery still surrounding several of the characters -- maybe that's the way it should remain!
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|Good feeling and clean audio mix with a more earthy style on this most recent album. Some of the songs were a bit slow for my taste, but I like the crisp and more individualistic approach taken by Avicii this time around. Definitely something I'll listen to often.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't like having to wait for more lives or to have to purchase them or to have to purchase the extra things.  It is fun to play.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Kindle is great opportunity for me to access my Facebook in a hurry. Easier access than<br />my smart phone. Thanks
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful character development...compelling story.  Told from a unique perspective.  Wanted to finish before I saw the movie...was amazed how quickly I got through it and hope there will be a sequel!
1936608898|3.0|It gave me insight as to the finer points of diet and how the body reacts to food. Since reading this book I have been better able to discuss diet options with my doctor and select a plan that has been successful in achieving my health goals.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I'm really not into games but I'm totally hooked on this one! The cars are super sweet. Customizing could use some more options but I like this simple and pain anyway!  Give this game a try.  Once race and you'll be hooked!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This movie is a must have for every Batman fan out there all ages love it buy it now right now
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Unique, enlightening and absolutely intriguing.  You want to keep reading to see what happens and the author keeps your interest to the end. A mystery that also deals with an unusual subject of autism in a refreshing compassionate way.
0553582011|4.0|This is a great book. It's not the best in the series but it's certainly a good story. Martin continues the stories we've been following for four books now and leaves us again on a cliffhanger. I hate how Martin has no qualms about killing some of our favorite characters.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love the books and the t.v. series too. Very intriguing saga continuance of this series. I love this collection. Would suggest this to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|comes in handy and its there when i need it  i seem to always be needing a calculator and it is 100%free
B00GIZO674|5.0|Addictive fun, is the best way to sum this up.  You'll have to fill food orders quickly, making burgers, shakes and fried treats.  It's challenging, if you play the story mode, but there's also a more casual mode where you can just fill orders without worrying about customers getting upset and walking away.  I recommend the this game if you like games with fast action and nice graphics.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|This movie is just awesome and funny. I just couldn't stop laughing and gave me a hint when I saw Tom Cruise what happens when I quit and don't need my job anymore.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This has been the solution to lack of HBO GO on the Roku box for Comcast/Xfinity. It was actually a pleasure to setup ( maybe because I'm a gadget freak) and the streaming quality is great considering you have decent internet speeds. I would recommend this product.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Mr Gaiman has been slapping down adverse comments on G R R Martin's turgid and interminable series. Telling all and sundry that &#34;G R R Martin is not your bitch&#34;. At the risk of incurring his ire this book is a huge disappointment. It is basically a YA novella stretched into a very short and very unsatisfactory book. I am only relieved that I found it on the library shelves - the fact that it was so readily available shortly after release should have warned me - I will be very reluctant to purchase his next books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Although its addictive it is the most realistic driving app I have used.  The psysics are surprisingly realistic and fun.  Definitely worth a try.  Keep the updates coming!
B005H9B44A|4.0|I watched this primarily because of the fantastic Tom Hiddleson (Loki) but, who knew, there actually was a story and even some humor.
0756655307|5.0|Awesome Marvel Encyclopedia! I also like how they are so detailed with the more famous heroes!!! They also have characters from alternative story lines too!
B0055MBQOM|4.0|I tried it on my iMac and Mac Pro. There is not much difference between original profile and the calibrated profile. I have secondary displays on both machinse which is the main reason I bought this device. However, the program stopped abruptly a few seconds into the calibration for the secondary displays on both machine.
140130916X|4.0|It was a good book. It made be cry once. One of the few times I've ever read a book and thought the movie was better though.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love the functionality and for the price you cant beat it. But unfortunately the amount of apps is still very limited and I find myself using it sparingly because of it. I don't regret the purchase especially for 35 bucks, but at the end of the day it is not doing different than what my current setup cant do. I do remain hopeful that more content will be view-able soon.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Great game - love Mahjong, not all are the same though.  Love the layout choices and clear easy to view screen.
B00F522C7C|5.0|Sure, this is kid friendly.  But the real context of the movie is all about our history and the planes that both were and are a part of that history. As an adult, the more you know about airplanes and the more you know about history, you will enjoy the movie to its fullest...you will &#34;get&#34; all of the one-liners meant for folks that really know the facts.  Please take time to watch the additional features...I would recommend that you do this before the movie...it gives nothing away but gives you a better understanding as to the work that went behind the animation to make this both<br />aerodynamically and historically correct.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|The writing is beautiful; the story is universal. If one hasn't read Steinbeck this is a good place to start.
B00BXDOSXS|3.0|This is probably a very good app. But it did not work for me. It tried to play my personal video just didn't work.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was definitely not at all what I expected. There's twists and turns that floored me! I wasn't expecting to be so wrapped up in the story. I'm so glad I bought the bundle. Having the ability to keep going was very nice. I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind!
B00ERP55NQ|2.0|This particular application was difficult to maneuver. Lacks info and thought just let me use my GPS instead. I had no patience for it.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Great app for those who like puzzles. Challenging yet not so hard you wanna throw your phone across the room :)
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Camera works great, but I cannot down load the accessories that go with it for editing.  When I do to the App store the App is never available.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|Placebo has been in a slump.the music sounded dead.no inspiration.<br />like&#34;battle for the sun&#34;or &#34;meds&#34;.their masterpiece without you I'm nothing seems far away.<br />I liked &#34;sleeping with ghosts&#34;.but even that is some time ago.<br />Placebo is back!<br />it's hard to believe.this music is beautiful.almost every song is great.<br />it's hard to describe.it's just different.<br />us alt kids can safely buy this album.<br />comeback of the year and way beyond.
B00GYKRKDA|5.0|If that doesn't tell you why to buy this you probably never would have clicked on this page in the first place.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game! Have it on my phone also. Go get it tell friends. If you like hunting games you will love this one.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As a single career woman, there are a lot of ways I am judges and end up judging myself. We need to break out of these artificial and outdated boxes and live proudly the lives we have. I may get married and I may have kids but I may not and those criteria shouldn't be used to judge my success in life. What I have done and will do are what should count. Cheryl Sandberg appreciates that and all of the choices women and men can make.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addicting annoying fun and awful all at the same time. Not much else to say. It is my bedtime ritual now instead of reading. DAMN YOU CANDY CRUSH!
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|One of my favorite Pink Floyd CDs.  Dark Side of the Moon is my favorite, but this is a close second.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I downloaded this just to check it out on a whim, and I have been having so much fun playing this!! It's fun, it's easy, my kids are fighting over who gets to play it next!!
B00EH49DXA|5.0|I Really enjoy the song and the video online is fun to watch. Katy is always upbeat and a real role model.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|For those who enjoyed reading the beloved novel, the cinematic version does it justice. Very enjoyable, suspenseful, and fast-paced flick.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Casino<br />There's nothing free about it if you want to keep playing.....when you run out of credits you have to purchase more to keep playing.
B0048WQDIE|1.0|I know this is a horrible way to review a classic, but I hated this book. I have enjoyed many of Mr. Heller's other books and expected that I would like this as well. After all, the phrase &#34;Catch-22&#34; is part of our culture. Basically, Catch-22 epitomizes the ridiculous nature of the military with its &#34;you can't win&#34; standards. The problem for me is that after the first dozen or so examples the whole concept became a bad Laurel and Harvey routine. I felt like the author was hitting me over the head saying &#34;Get it? Do you get it?&#34; I actually found it annoying. I realize that Mr. Heller was totally anti-war/military, but I don't feel that this particular book helped his point.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|well written story line well plotted embroidered  together are intricate sub plots that keep your attention like all great page turners should looking forward to reading more harry bosch's crime detection skills
B0026772N8|5.0|This is one of those books that should be on everyone's &#34;need to read this&#34; list. It may initially seem odd for a book to be philosophical and motorcycle-related. But it works. Mr. Pirsig's observations on life are so touching and relevant. This is one of those books that I know I will re-read.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Awesome movie! Have watched it numerous times.  Giving this one as a gift. Can't wait for them to get it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I was one of the few people in the world who never watched the show, but once it had its finale I realized I must have missed something. I love it and will have to get the rest of the seasons.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Words can't describe how much I LOVE THIS BOOK.  It made me laugh, smile, CRY MY EYES OUT, I fell deeply in love with the characters and they are so relateable.  John Green is my favorite author, he captures the readers attention from the very first page. He is Genius absolutely incredible.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Great characters, Grisham does of fine job of making you see the story line unfold. The ending was too predictable for me.
1936608898|2.0|This book was recommended by an acupuncturist who is practicing a paleo diet as are many of her clients. She insisted that this is the way to go and it may very well be. However, I found this book to be incredibly boring. And not motivating to make a drastic change as is suggested.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game after a long day at work it help me to relax and I have fun at the same time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought it was a wonderful game but it is just a newer app than 100 floors but I do recommend it to anyone ages 5-up maybe 6-7-up idk but its still a good app
B000003TA4|5.0|I love Nirvana! I'm a huge fan. I was 9 when Kurt Cobain died but I still rock out to this c.d like it's new. Which is why I had to buy another, I wore the others out :) &#60;3
B003M70O5O|5.0|Love to watch sons on HD. I  was catching up on old seasons on Netflix but it's not in HD so I'm so glad I was told about prime members can watch tv shows n movies for free. It's a great added enjoyment.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is a horror style TV show that grabs you from the beginning.  I recommend watching it in the daylight hours if your not into horror.  Great show and the story line was interesting.
B009XI7RF6|3.0|Bought this app a few months ago and it was boring I barely remember playing it.  It was free so I cannot complain.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|EVERYONE loves this series!  Can't wait for the new one to begin.  too bad we have to wait until January to get it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Highly recommended for any dog lover who is convinced their companion has a little humanity in that \\"wag\\". Thank you, Mr. Stein!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Most of us have read what a horrid place Okinawa was but never heard of Peleliu, except that in hindsight it might have been best to isolate. Who knows? But Sledgehammer's experiences make it clear, it is as close to hell on earth as you can imagine. God bless them all.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Beautiful portral of strong women characters with a clear message that the interest of others sometimkes must be placed before our own.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an excellent tool to help self publishers ....my husband and I enjoyed reading and it has enabled us to be successful in purblishing my first book  &#34;Fast Escape&#34;  ...Thanks !<br /><br />Dr. Bonnie Vause, Ed.D.<br />Author of Fast Escape  (Used your book to assist me in publishing my 1st Kndle Book !)<br /><br />Like my FB Page:<br />Bonnie Vause, Author
B002YEQRPC|1.0|It does not work on PS3. It says region A & B but blank screen. Total waste of money, nothing more.
B008JFURII|5.0|I saw Red and when I learned Red 2 was coming out I was thrilled! So, of course I had to order it. We did see it in the theaters first, so that just made my resolve even stronger. Paclage was a little abused, but it didn't damage the product. Timing was perfect and I would buy from this seller again.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Okay, I finally figured out that clearing my App Store cache would free up enough space on my 8GB kindle to install this game.  It was a lot of trouble, but it really is pretty fun.  There's a huge roster of DC favorites to collect, though the bigger names (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc. etc.) will take you some time.  Gameplay is fairly simple (tap and swipe, activate special attacks, and collect coins to power up your characters or buy  new characters.  The coin prices are a bit crazy (a fully decked out team will run you big bucks, but you can eventually get there through a lot of grinding), so lock this thing down if you have younger kids using your device.<br /><br />Just be sure you have plenty of free space before you try to load this game - but if you're a DC comics fan looking for a straight-forward game with plenty of fan-service you won't be disappointed.
B00G922EA2|5.0|I am really enjoying this game so far. It's very interesting and the storyline seems intriguing. Will be back later to update my review if needed.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|My daughter is a huge Les Mis fan. She goes around the house singing to this constantly. She has it set as her wake up music on her Kindle Fire!
B008JFUR10|5.0|The opening sequence is worth the cost of the DVD or admission to the theatre. I loved how it was filmed. I loved the imagery, the mechanics, etc.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Wakes my daughter up on time. She uses this on her Kindle Fire as her primary alarm! Pretty colors too.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|This book is beautifully written, has fascinating colourful characters, a great story and an intriguing structure which all came together beautifully at the end  - loved it!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great fun to play, although a bit destructive, which I do not enjoy very much at all, so there. I am sometimes frustrated by missing the pigs.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Finding things that are out of sight can be found in the most interesting places. Fun for all players. Beginning is exciting.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|When I first opened the game, I did not think I would like it. But, surprisingly, I have become addicted. The puzzles are challenging and there are plenty of rewards. I play every day and it's replaced some of my old favorites.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Get this get this ........plz get this game it's the best game ever in dc you start you can't stop get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good Game For Your Mind To Stay Busy.  Keeps You sharp. WOuld Recommend To everyOne That I Know Rihgt now.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Glee is so well written and the cast tells the story so well through music and script. I love it!
B000FA5STS|5.0|This one is such a mystery!  I didn't know who was really involved in the murders until the very end!
B002M89UMW|5.0|A beautiful look at a time that never was.  A wonderful story coupled with amazing musical numbers.  This is a movie that never fails to bring a smile to my face and a warming of my heart.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you are looking for a consistent experience when watching movies, then this device is what you need. Google has hit the bulls eyes...if you have more than one TV  and most likely the bands are different like i do you will never be able to have the same experience throughout your home, the reason is that all TVs have their own UI some are OK some are down right ugly. Top sets like apple TV or Roku are good in there own right but they only address part of what a true movie night experience can be. Chromecast however addresses 99% of what i consider as a great experience for watching movies...with the Chromecast you create your own, you have your choose of OS or you can use both if you have both platforms IOS or droid...by using your phone  or tablet you can now browse for what you want to watch and once you find just click on the Chromecast icon if the TV is off it will switch on the TV and go to the correct input and show what you chosen to cast, or say the TV is on cable channel ESPN it will switch to the correct input to cast your chosen flick... no more having to switch to the top set or use that ugly UI that the TVs come with. no more using the remote to type for searching a movie to watch... you now type on the device of your choice. Its completely different from airplay...as once you start casting your device is free for anything or anyone to use. there are more features or uses not mention...You will not be unhappy if you get this one.<br /><br />Some might complain about lack of supported apps....but the same complaints were heard of Appletv etc and many new devices in this space...once Google put their resources behind this product it will be hands down the best way for movie night...<br /><br />Once apps like NBA, NHL, Picasa. M-GO and the likes joins... I think it will be truly the best streaming device out there...<br /><br />That's my take, hope it helps anyone who trying to make a decision.<br /><br />Note Device at home.<br />1.Top Sets= Appletv, Roku, WD, Google, PS3, Chromecast  (only using Chromecat now)<br /><br />2. TV= Sony 4K 65&#34;, Sony 47&#34; Vizio 70&#34;  (absolutly hate UI)<br /><br />3. OS Platform=ipads and iphone, Sony tablet z, sony phone z, HTC One, S3  (Apple device seems to have the updated apps when compared between the two OS's)<br /><br />Will updated if my opinion changes for any reason.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's not very impressive.  Once my IPAD goes to sleep, the movie on the TV screen keeps going, and I can no longer control it from the IPAD.  If I only watch half the movie, I usually have to try to figure out where I was when I stopped.  For netflix, Apple TV is head and shoulders above this product.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This show is amazing!  Every episode has a twist to it that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Amazon Instant video is an Awesome way to keep up with the current season and it saves your seasons to your account so you can access them from any mobile device or stream it through your TV via any streaming device.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book was a very enjoyable and educational read. I have learned some interesting things about natural body responses and will continue to re read and refer back to it as I learn the art of body language.
B008469DGY|5.0|Love this golf game has unique levels and not too hard to make it too difficult. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This is her masterpiece, so far. She has captured what Nigeria was like before the civil war and the suffering that followed it. I would recognize her characters if they walked into my house. Although Ms. Adichie is Igbo, she doesn't take sides in the way one might expect. She tells the story of the people and war the way she heard it. This novel should join Achebe's Things Fall Apart and Soyinka's Ake in the classrooms of Nigeria and on the reading lists of anyone wanting to understand modern Nigeria. You'll love it from page one until the very last page.
B00F9040HU|5.0|Very challenging game. I just love it!  Wish I could find some more. Sometimes I wait until evening and play away!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It was a book club read. It is not one I would have chosen but glad I read it.
B00B7FOQCK|1.0|My usb's can hardly fit into the ports because the edges are rounded making me have to almost break it to get my usb into it!<br /><br />Terrible, i wouldn't recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game I got it because  my son played it. Its much more fun than frustrating<br />I'm still enjoying it great job.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoy the simple pleasures puzzles.  There are plenty of puzzles and the graphics are great. I WOULD RECOMMEND to ant puzzle lover.
B00007KWHG|5.0|great cd, great songs, great price it was the perfect gift for my dad thank you all so much !
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The game was intriguing enough for me to spend 499 coins to unlock the full version, which I now regret.  The graphics took a nose dive in the paid version.  The price is way too high for this game and not as much fun as the free portion was.  Now it's basically going from scene to scene looking for hidden objects and solving puzzles, not playing carnival games.  The Hint button recharges quickly.  The Skip button doesn't show the solution, just jumps to the next part.  It would've been way more fun to actually be able to feel as though you were riding the ferris wheel, the carousel and roller coaster.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|My kids love this movie, they watch both all the time.  The music is great and the plot is very interesting and keeps their attention.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love this show and it was great to catch up on the episodes that I missed!!! The music is fantastic.
B002XXUWMI|4.0|Pros: Talented actors, great story (Matrix before there was a Matrix by several years)<br />Cons: Worst performance of Kiefer Sutherland, very dark, a bit low budget<br /><br />I really liked this movie when I first saw it, years before the Matirx came out. When I saw the Matirx, all I could think of was, &#34;This is Dark City with better effects, not as dark, and not as many talented actors&#34;. Don't get me wrong, not suggesting Matrix is a rip off of Dark City, just that it wasn't as original a storyline as it was promoted as. I suspect the writers had seen Dark City years before and the idea stuck, then they modified it. Dark City has the &#34;one&#34; who can control their system. Matrix has the &#34;one&#34; who can control their system. Dark City has &#34;They&#34; who are using humans as test subjects to learn what is missing from themselves and grow. Matrix has &#34;They&#34; who use humans as a power source to further their ends ... you get the idea. I'd recommend this movie, but keep in mind, it was panned when it first came out, though seems to be liked by many.
0988262592|5.0|Wonderful book! I'd been wanting to read this one for a few months and finally got around to it. It was so good that it was hard to put down. It really brought me back to some real world situations in my profession... Highly recommended.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am using this on my Kindle. Last weekend my family went out of state and wanted to listen to the GA/Kentucky game. I had downloaded the TuneIn Radio app and it told me that the Kindle was running too slow for broadcast. I downloaded the Clean Master app and it help me clean up the Kindle in no time. So I impressed my husband with my ability to get the broadcast (I impressed myself, too.).
B00G91WB3S|5.0|Wonderful themes in this film. Our whole family enjoyed watching and finding themes that remind us of the Gospel that The Father Sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great way to listen in to football games when you aren't home. I used this to listen to the GA/Kentucky game! That was impressive for this senior citizen.
B008D30K7E|5.0|It was such a refreshing, lovely, uplifting, thought-provoking read, I laughed my way through it. The plot was so cleverly woven that the improbability of it didn't bother me in the slightest.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of things to do on the game. Pretty good graphics for a horse game also. Can get boring after awhile though.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun and never the same course. But when I entered the age for my 3 yr old it is not at a level that he could play it. I on the other hand play it almost daily! It is a bit slow to retry a run, as in has to start from the very beginning and go.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|most addictive gameni have played innanlong while never thought I would be one twit here playing games non stop well here I find myself
B00498YZH8|5.0|Even though the content of the movie is about drugs/death/ and bad things in general , it was very well acted! It kept my intrest though the entire movie and all in all it was a really good movie! I felt so sorry for Jennifer Lawrence portrayal of the teenage girl. And the entire family for that matter. All in all great movie!
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Movie was a gift for someone, and they were surprised and excited!!! Even sat through it myself, interesting story told!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm a sucker for period pieces. And this show does it very well! The writing is excellent, the acting is excellent, and the storytelling is excellent as well. It seemlessly evolves over time and cover a lot of history whether it be fashion, social morality, or politics. Great show!
B0086700CM|5.0|We have it on the main computer and everyone likes to play it.  My mom (a senior citizen) loves playing it.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|A wonderful, classic movie, funny without being treacly.  And it is a rare exploration of a university from the perspective of the townies (\\"Cutters\\").  I've watched this movie maybe four times, and loved it every time, along with everybody else I watched it with.  Highly recommended.<br /><br /> PS The Tour de Trees made a detour to see where Breaking Away was filmed when it was in the area
B00594XOZU|5.0|a lot of people are saying that there are problems but I wanted a kik on my kindle so bad that I took the chance. I am having no problems at all, and its working just as amazingly as it did on my iphone. I love it!!
B00C74SHRK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book - loved the way it is written - contrast of different ways of life - the drama - suspense - everything! Have read Secret History and the Little Friend so am obviously a fan of this writter.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I usually enjoy reading Grisham for a little extracurricular enjoyment. I liked having this book to read to fill up some recent travel time. But this is nothing special or engaging. It's the too familiar Grisham formula, with another change of clothes..
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great story which continues to develop using historical data to allow the reader to understand the complexities of that time period. Looking forward to the next segment
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is not what I expected but I am sure as with new technology it will expand with time along the way
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that Subway Surfers is a great game for kids and and adults.  I love playing when I am feeling down.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This was a Birthday Present for my Brother-in-law who collects Star Wars Legos, I asked him which one he wanted he said as a Joke that he wanted either the Star Destroyer or Death Star. Both my nephews and him was very surprised when I brought it to his house, I told him it is his present for B-day & X-mas from 2012 till 2015 since it cost so much.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's beautiful and well made. I played on Facebook but ended up quitting because I was never near a computer long enough to do everything. Now that it's on Kindle fire I can play everywhere that has Wi-Fi. Love it! Thanks for making a great game!!
B00005NIL9|5.0|there's several versions of this one and of course amazon.com has mixed up the reviews. probably to save space and money. but it is still annoying. I have the remaster version with six extra tracks. That is the best version out there. However the deluxe version has a lot of songs that I don't have here. But the deluxe sets are very expensive so It's hard to justify getting them unless you are a completest. The disc itself is probably the bands finest moment. Although the two preceding this one are great  too. At this time the guitarist was not yet destroyed by hard drugs. They would take his life and shatter the band. Whose members would go on to form the even bigger 'bad company'..  This one has the gigantic hit single 'all right now' on it. And several other versions of that song as bonus tracks. There's not a weak song on here. Unlike lets say 'free at last' and 'highway'.  Heartbreaker&#34; though was a last great gasp from them.  I would say if  you can get the version with six bonus tracks get it.  Or the deluxe if you think you can justify the extra money for it.  The remastering is excellent on the one I got though. Top notch.  The sounds here are hard rock and mellow rock mixture and these guys were very good at what they did.  I would say even their weakest cd , 'free at last' has some fine moments. but this was their greatest moment.
B00355L2TU|3.0|It was just an ok for me  I have tried several programs and this one was just ok  Jillian is a great trainer
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|I was looking forward to another Pendergast novel because I love this character but this one disappointed me.  Maybe not enough Pendergast!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Love this game but need more neighbors. Farm I'd is EAXUZUG. Need active neighbors please play with me. I play. Every day.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is always available when I want to find out who is trying to contact me. Some of it is trash. Easily trashed. Some of it informative.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a game that lasts awhile through all the levels. I just need to know how to get the updates and the free boosters daily on the Kindle Fire.  Thank You, Patricia Turner.  pattyturner55@yahoo.com
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i am so excited to finally have a kindle app. this game is so addicting and very fun to play.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I'm Tristen Holliday and I love the game it's awesome fun pretty cool. I have you know that suck is losing their battles
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Great stuff. Like a crossing between Nevermore, DreamTheater and Otep.  I have had the album on repeat this entire week and I keep hearing new and interesting pieces in the songs. Instantly one of my top favorite albums.
B008JDAC7G|4.0|This is an awesome game and shoukd not be confused with the free version this has an unlimited mode and  a timed one while the other has timed only. This is a mix of Jena (dont let the tower fall) and I would say just about any color matching game don't let the fact that it says adult swim screen you That's just the company along with pick pok Made this really fun game even kids would enjoy it  it's really fast paced and theres always room for beating your high score which makes the replay value that much more. Challenge friends to beat your score etc etc you can't go wrong I have an old phone and this runs smooth on my phone :)
B003XURDAY|2.0|I did not enjoy this science fiction movie.  It seemed very chopped up and hard to view.  I guess I'm not a science fiction person.
B003F48E4W|5.0|It's one of my all-time favorite movies, featuring very cool characters and music. I like that there's humor among the violence as well.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|But for one scene which was iffy, this movie was pretty good.  Regular cowboy show with good guys and bad guys.
B00E1LQ7Q0|5.0|Better and better with every listen through.<br /><br />To discuss something not many other people are, I love the extended tracks.  It goes beyond normal radio edits vs. album version.  As with &#34;Amnesia&#34;, the song comes to an end and then suddenly kicks back into a modified version with a different take on the song.  This double album creates an atmosphere, and the long tracks make it just that much better.  It feels something like a jam session at a live concert.  JT takes the song and makes it into something new for fun.
B002GSXKN8|4.0|fine for teens/adults.  don't know much about these movies.  got them for my son.  CLEARLY NOT AGE APPROPRIATE.  don't know what i was thinking.  must have been sleep deprived when i ordered them.  will hold these for another 10 years.  :-)
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Love it. This app allows me to open and edit all of the Microsoft Office documents that I typically use. I wouldn't recommend using it to create complex MS Office documents from scratch, but it's great for reviewing and minor edits.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book took me by surprise. It was a little weird in the beginning BUT it was so funny and so true!! Loved it
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|We have another fledgling Pendergast!  She's a sleuth with attitude. It's what Preston & Child are famous for, a mystery that gives you goose bumps.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play.<br /><br />But it's also frustrating, because it keeps telling me that I have to wait x amount of time before I can continue playing. I don't see a pattern with its determination of how long my &#34;time outs&#34; will be, either. They just seem random. So I downloaded a couple of other games to bide my time while Candy Crush basically goes into limp mode on me. &#34;Sugar coma&#34;, mayhaps?
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|Arcade Fire are a talented group of musicians who seem to work really well together.  But I just don't sense much urgency or originality in their music after their fabulous debut, &#34;Funeral.&#34; Inspiration is one thing, but their songs sound like ripoffs of other, better artists.  This new one is okay and has moments of brilliance, but it has to be the most overrated album in recent memory.<br /><br />The Suburbs seemed the most derivative of them all.  &#34;Roccocco&#34; sounds like a Pixies song (in a very self-conscious way), &#34;Sprawl&#34; sounds like Blondie, and then there's another track that sounds like a ripoff of My Bloody Valentine.  I can't really pick out the ripoffs on the new album yet, but it sounds, well, overproduced and overambitious to a fault.<br /><br />And my gosh they have the WORST lyrics I've heard in a while.  Very cliche and pretentious -- but luckily the lyrics on this album don't have &#34;kids&#34; ever other line.<br /><br />So... I enjoy some of the tracks.  But I'm just not really inspired or moved by this current, paint-by-numbers approach.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Joust is awesome!<br /><br />War Games is thermonuclear!<br /><br />This book is  the +5 vorpal bastard sword of stories.<br /><br />Allusions galore for the middle-aged geek.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The third book was definitely a distant third.  It felt like the author was making things up as she went.  The story was OK until the end.  It seemed like she woke up and said, &#34;Ob crap, it's due tomorrow.&#34;  All of a sudden the details took a back seat and we did a quick gloss-over.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Finding Nemo has always been a fun movie to watch.  It's beautifully done, but man... 3D really makes it pop.  I recently bought a 3D player to go with my 3D TV and thought &#34;why not, lets buy Nemo&#34;.  A great buy!  It was reasonably priced, so it was the best of both worlds.  A fun movie in 3D that didn't cost an arm and a leg.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What can I say?  Being a Google fan for a while, I like everything Google makes.  The chromecast is yet another innovative product that I like.  It plays youtube flawlessly.  That is all I care about.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I didn't think i would like this movie as much as I did.  I was impressed by the raw singing.  I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed Crowe in the film.  He did a great job.  People complain about the singing but I think it makes it feel more authentic.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|The series is simply one of the best period dramas on TV, but then again what do you expect from HBO. This review is not really about the show itself but the quality of the set. If you've purchased an HBO's series in the past, like game of thrones, then you know how this works. You get a great blu ray set along with an HD digital copy that you can play on any medium, including your big screen tv.<br /><br />If the movie studios are paying attention HBO's blu ray sets are, what you might call, the Cadillac of sets. This should be what the studies aspire to provide the customer. If not, well, don't look to me to shed a tear for film piracy. Get your act together and provide a quality product that people will happily buy! Simple as that! Where is the standardization, so that customers know what to expect, movie studios?
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|I've seen the Hobbit in IMAX and on Cable, but I thought that this movie was so well done that it would be worth owning.  I never bought an &#34;extended&#34; editon before, but I'm glad I did this time.  Some fanatstic little scenes that were cut are left in and it made a movie I've seen 3 times seem fresh and full of new surprises.  I especially liked the Goblin King song.
B001YV5068|1.0|I, like many holiday shoppers, recently bought quite a few blu rays over the last week. But like an idiot, I opened most of them at one time and redeemed the digital copies without paying attention to the details. Had I known that many of the digital copies were SD and not HD, these films would not have been purchased in the first place.<br /><br />Amazon, if you're listening, you need to distinguish in the listings what is enclosed.<br /><br />And movie houses, seriously, wtf? Buying a blu ray and including a SD digital copy? Do I really need to explain how your inferior product perpetuates film piracy? As someone who loves movies and wants to own them, I know you can do better! If not, well enjoy your piracy tax!
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|excellent read but not on a par with some of the others and I have read them all and enjoyed every one
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I grabbed this as the free app of the day as I had never played the board game before. After playing, I would definitely say I would pay for this app if I had to do it all over again, and I will be purchasing any add-ons that may be released. Fantastic game - well made and runs very smoothly. A delight!
0062278096|5.0|A great addition for show lovers!<br />A wonderful, in-depth look at the show from conception to filming.<br />Throughout are exerpts of a scrapbook about each 'case' (episode) put together by John Watson, with comments from Sherlock left on the pages with 'post-it notes'.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was surprised at how this movie held my interest.  I read the books years ago, but thought I would not like the screen version...well, I was wrong.  I'm not sure how easy it would be to follow if you had not read the book, but the popularity of the franchise leads me to believe that it's possible.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Although I felt motivated when reading this it was really difficult to stick to.  I lost 7 pounds the first week and then gained back 5 the next.  I think I only lasted a month at it and only lost the 2 pounds.  For me it wasn't worth the trouble.<br />I am vegetarian and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. This diet discourages fruit and relies on meat for the low carb diet.  Just didn't work for me.
067144901X|4.0|super cute! giving to my nephews as a gift so hope they are enjoyed by him, i purchased 4 of the boynton books, they are all really cute!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Well worth the time. The story moves along at a brisk pace, but doesn't lose you. Entertaining and enjoyable to read.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Anthem is exactly what the name implies. Each song on this record is an anthem for my generation. The album starts with &#34;Fired up&#34; and I honestly can't stop listening to it. It is a great pop song with lots of old rock -n- roll influence. I grew up listening to an eclectic mix of everything from the 1920's to modern day radio. This album seems to encompass a similarly eclectic and creative feel, channeling the likes of Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, The Bee Gees and The Beatles. :) Lots of great dance songs, beautiful ballads and powerful harmonies that the Hanson brothers are most known for. If you like the classics but crave something new, this might be for you.
B00428CPUY|5.0|Picture was very clear and value for money. I ordered it before I went on holiday. Its nice to come back home and have the DVD waiting for me. It takes more then a week for me to get it as I am in Western Australia.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I felt the story started slowly but picked up considerably after ship sinks. Yann Martel has spun a fantastic yarn with Life of Pi. I recommend it to anyone and I am now looking forward to seeing the film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|BEWARE... ADDICTING!<br />Love this app!  Have it on my iPhone, computer & now on my Kindle fire.<br />I find it very relaxing.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this game for my adult son and his wife, along with Perudo.  I absolutely loved this game, but then it appeals to me as I like strategy games.  Someone else said it's much like the game 'Tetris' and I agree.  Am thinking of buying one for my own house!
B009GEYX5E|3.0|My main complaint is how ridiculously expensive it has been made to get to take 8 photos with a polaroid instant camera. Other than that, the photos turned out fine. Make sure you cover them and don't disturb them for about 30 minutes after you take them or they may get messed up.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love it the best GAME ever since  2002  you know what................uno<br />  Best GAME EVER awesome awesome awesome<br /><br />I love it so much
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Hands down this is Jodi Picoult's best book to date... and I have read them all.  Just waiting for the next one to come out.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|After watching &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34;, a documentary about the search for Rodriguez, I downloaded the album.  His music is compelling.  His voice has a pure quality.
B0036FYO12|5.0|I still find this movie thrilling. Redford and Dunaway provide fine performances. Having friends in the intelligence community, the theme is too heavy on the conspiracy side but still very entertaining.
B003TNW044|3.0|One of the Discs is damaged and skips during play. I bought this package new, not used, all the discs should work perfectly.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Best acting ever. Hard to think things were this way at some time in our history. Wonderful script, wonderful cast. Sheet pie for the biotches was wonderful.
B002POVIMS|5.0|La Roux is amazingly talented. I hadn't heard all her music, but what I had heard I loved. So I decided to purchase her album and hear more of La Roux. And I am very pleased I did.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Put it right in my car and started listening the same day I received it.<br />I am absolutely in love with Katy Perry and how her style is never predictable.<br />Track # 15, &#34;It Takes Two&#34; is probably my favorite on the CD, and I didn't think it could get any better than the release of &#34;Roar.&#34;<br />This will be on repeat for a while...
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Wow, what a finish! To bring this epic to the fourth age and finish for another author, it was incredibly well done. I'm amazed that Brandon Sanderson was able step in and capture the essence of Robert Jordan's writing style so easily and keep the story intact. If you have not read the Wheel of Time series you're missing out on one of the greatest epics ever written. I started this series in the 90s and have eagerly awaited every book. All I can say is I'd do it again.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book, read in one evening, shot near the top of my most favorite list...and I am not entirely sure I can tell you exactly why. It was a new story, and a damned clever, unusual one. For as much as I read, I deeply appreciate something fresh. It is a story of a man, revisiting odd memories of his boyhood. Disturbing memories, but certainly life-altering. Our boy is part of a loving family undergoing the tumultuousness of poor economy and cutbacks. One of the results of these cutbacks is that he loses his bedroom, with the sink that is just his size, to the tenants that his parents bring in to grow their income. One of these untoward characters dies. It is here our tale really begins. It is here that the tear in the unseen magikal fabric between worlds starts to fray and bend life as we know it. Introduce the 3 women living on the farm at the end of the lane. A girl. Her mother. Her grandmother. Odd women. Powerful women. Magikal women. The boy ends up being an unintended vehicle of sorts for the darkness and lurking evils to creep more lively onto our plane of existence and the women are the conduits for good, for healing, for repair. I did not realize until the end that I had been reading a Maiden-Mother-Crone story and am still puzzling out what it all meant. You know a book was good when you are still thinking about its pieces and puzzles weeks after reading it. (I love that the magik in this book is never emphasized or explained. In fact, in the beginning, odd things happen in passing, as though perhaps we, like the boy, just misunderstood... until later when we realize the magik is indeed magical, yet continues to be treated as second nature. It was a pleasure to let my imagination ride through the story in this rare and exciting way.) We have a worm hole in a foot, a doorway from the heart, an ominous pink and gray flapping tent, dead fish, dangerous birds, monsters, fleas, fairie circles, a flaming orange sky, an ocean in a bucket and oh gads, an Ursula Monkton...nkton...
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Watching this special episode was just that special. It had enough little ditties that contains nods to previous episodes and previous doctors as well. Being a fan of Doctor Who , I can say that this episode is a lot of fun that brings 50 years of this show full circle.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I apologize to the author in advance. I simply did not 'need' this book. Frankly, it is beautifully written, articulate, a VERY GOOD story, well woven and spun. Moriarty did an excelled job winding 3 unrelated families under one umbrella of tangled events. Bravo really. For me however, I ended wondering why I needed to read this book. It is a contemporary story about a few families lives in Australia. There is murder, deceit, mistrust, lies, unfaithfulness, grief, children, a broken ankle, several dysfunctional marriages, lots of church moms, revelations and perhaps the beginnings of healings...I guess this really comes down to my taste. I don't enjoy these painful, stressful things in real life and I realize I certainly don't enjoy spending my time reading about yet more of it in books either. Not entertaining for this reader.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This album is amazing. It makes me move and laugh out loud with the silly interludes. Her compilations are the truth!My favorite is Electric Lady but the entire album is in heavy rotation in the house, car and at work.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|I give it 4 stars because it did make me laugh several times, which is a good thing.  Anybody who has worked in an office will probably enjoy the mockery of office red tape and politics.  However some parts of the movie are dumb.  Jennifer Aniston's character is one of the weakest in the movie, but I guess she was just included for star power.  The ending of the movie was contrived, so the movie is not a masterpiece but is worth a few laughs.
B00AHSKRJ4|4.0|This movie had a nice balance of humor and drama and great acting.  It was very entertaining and relevant to life.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game kills my boredom.  Very fun and easy to play. Need more neighbors though.  Not many facebook friends have this game yet.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Typical Gaiman - a fantasy world with adult themes that's hidden from the real world in plain sight. And yet, every one of his books feels completely different from the last.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|I Watch it again and again...i love Stargate Atlantis, all the Stargates actually.<br />Thank you for have all the seasons at once.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I almost fell asleep reading it was so boring it was more uninteresting than my English and Math classes do not read
B004WKI204|5.0|Was laughing out loud on the beach reading this during vacation. Fresh, fun and an honest look into Tina's life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed reading this! I would recommend this to young adults.  I can't wait to read the rest of the sequel
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a great app and encourage it for everyone. It has separate mini games and you can compete. I love it and hope you will to.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Painful to watch.  The point of view switches around so much it's hard to focus on anything.  I can't believe the director would release such a crudely edited film with such cheesy transitions.  Everything is over the top, the makeup, the the hair, every visual aspect of this digitally manipulated travesty.  At times it feels like you're in a bad acid trip.  And the hip hop music? Ugh. Just awful.
B00GNL96H8|4.0|This movie is a great companion to the Ip Man series. It showed a later life price paid by the reluctant hero. I enjoyed the internal conversations shared with the audience about every aspect of his life which was experienced in the movie. If it were not for the subtitles, I would have given it a five-star rating.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie.  She has watched it many, many times now and still loves it.  I like it too!
0525951652|5.0|Incredible amount of research in all his novels I've read...keeps me coming back.  I'm enjoy historic fiction and his delivery!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in about 4 hours. It is an excellent story and extremely hard to put down. I can't wait to read the second book!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is the best book about a dog that I have ever read.  I have a Golden retriever and I hope she can think this way.  Great, great book!!!
B00G9U7NEQ|2.0|Not at all as good as the first one.  Did Mike and Sully loose their personalities?  There appeared to be too much bullying too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got for my grandson and he loves it. Plays when he comes to visit. I found I like it too.
B006G7R25W|5.0|Still hold up today as a crack 1960s spy thriller.Rock Hudson was at his peak. It must have been unique for a sub to go under the ice in those days. Good movie all around.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great characters games music and it changes the difficulty by your age so it is a perfect game for anyone!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This one is really easy to follow and the characters are well written. Like the style of this writer too.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|We caught a good price on this Lego set. It came quickly via Prime and my son will probably enjoy the 5 minutes he spends assembling it.
B0081SRJSY|2.0|What point is a board game if you can't play with friends. Sure, you can do pass & play, but I have a hard copy of the game for that. Add online play and then we'll talk.
B00AVIPEHU|5.0|Paul Walker's character is really a good guy, loving companion and father who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  For his trouble, he paid the ultimate price.  This sounds like his personal life, but the movie has a twist that sadly does not resemble his final day on this planet.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It works great at first. Then you have delete it then download it again because it stopped working. But I still like the app in general.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Not a real book, but as explained before buying it a collection of blog posts.<br /><br />I loved reading through Mr. Cuban's personal experiences and stories and there were some very good points. Just starting a business I could relate to the points made. The book is like you would expect from Mr. Cuban, down to the point and in plain English. Nothing too complicated.<br /><br />My only point of improvement would be that is almost was too short. I wish there would have been some more experiences from Mr. Cuban and other business advise in the book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|this is networked owned & doesn't play much on TV. It's a classic & simply must watch movie during the holidays. Now I can watch it on my schedule. I like this 60th aniv. version for the quality, etc.<br />Glad its avail to purchase.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I this is the best game ever never been able to put it down I would totialy refreshments this game
159413586X|5.0|I am a big fan of this trilogy. This books makes you feel as if you are right there in the story. I would recommend this book but only after you have read the first two!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I gave this book 5  stars because it is just so (I can't find a word to explain it) I wish there were more types of books like this, I would never stop reading!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a fun game that's SUPER HARD to stop playing!!  I would recommend it for all ages. It gets pretty frustrating when you can get pass certain levels.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|Holly carp never played a game so cool and realistic.I wish I could someday make a game this awesome game.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A good read, but I thought the author ran out of steam at the book's end.  Not quite the page turner &#34;Kite Runner&#34; was.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|greatest movie for almost 20 years, can watch again and again, great video streaming, one of the best oscar winners ever
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's great fun and isn't too complicated.  I can bring it up and work through it quickly and effortlessly.  Bravo
B001XUH69Y|5.0|brilliant classic movie, greatest black and white movie for a long time, brilliant actor and actress, very moving, spirit uplifting
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|The Maggie Newberry series were a great read, stories easy to get into and follow, just what was needed at the end of a hectic day.  just wish there were more of them...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Everything I need to know about the weather is at the tip of my finger. Very useful and handy to have.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|I ordered this as a gift, it came quickly and was as if I had gotten from a store! Excited to see it opened!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Its Harry Potter, Duh! Why else would I give it such a great rating.  Everyone loves Harry Potter.  Don't they?
0739381237|5.0|this filled out the world and answered questions that hadn't really been thought about. It showed more about Percy Anna Beth and some of the other people who are demagogues.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Fast, fun, addictive. What more can you ask of a game with such simplicity in design and prentationn? Great job!-
B008JFUNTG|5.0|Percy Jackson and the city of monsters is a good second movie in the series. It's a movie that I enjoyed watching very much when it was released in the theaters , and I will very much enjoy watching it on DVD when I received this in the mail
B000000WCX|5.0|One of my favorite albums, and was happy to find one in such great condition at such a great price
1427235392|5.0|Enders game is an excellent book takes us to worlds we have never seen, and gives a person something to wonder about, and to be able to ask questions. What would you do in this situation
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I needed this. A rough and rowdy, yet melodic and moving batch of songs. Splendid new tunes with sweet hooks, blazing guitars with hot licks, powerful and passionate vocals; it all sounds inspired and wonderful. This album makes me get up and dance and wave my arms in the air, sing and smile; it's just a good feeling all the way around. Not much more I need from an album. No need for deep analysis; this one is a winner on all counts. A truly great and rockin' return to form.
B00000JSJC|5.0|awesome movie and i love angela basset in it. i can say that it kept my attention. also makes you think of what if
1476727651|5.0|Loved this book! Hard to put down from beginning to end, and one of his best in my mind. I did have to go back and watch/read the Shining again, as some of the references I had forgotten about,  but it was a great read!
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|So someone told me they finally put the real Terraria on the Kindle. I instantly bought it. I've been playing it for quite some time. Movement was hard to get the hang of. I figured it out, but it is still hard to do. It is hard to jump. A double-jump is impossible. You have to jerk the joystick down and then up to jump, if you don't want to stop and jump. I figured out that these controls are horrible when I tried to fight the easiest boss in the game. I had full Iron armor and a Musket. When I play on the PC  it is extremely easy to out maneuver this boss. On this, I got stuck in between two houses and he eventually killed me. This should never happen. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;struggling with the controls more than with the boss. Besides this, I have had a lot of fun with this game. It plays like an older version but still works and plays well. But if I can't kill this boss, I have no idea how to kill others.<br /><br />Also, the spawn rate of Shadow Orbs (objects that need to be destroyed to reach the 2nd boss and get loot) needs to be increased. I can only find 2 in my world, and you need 3 to summon the boss. I can not progress in this world, so now I need to create another world to destroy and go back to my home.<br /><br />But like I said, this game is still really good. If they fix these issues I would love it.<br /><br />You should still buy this game, you can have a ton of fun  with it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|In my opinion it is just like the console version only I can take this one anywhere I go, so now Injustice just got even better
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game..! Just hate doing the Facebook carp. Wish you could just turn that part off. But other wise it's great!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|keeps me up on my friends and family.  great place to share with all. love to see pictures and news.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Way better than anything I expected from a third installment. This movie lived up to its predecessors and was packed with plenty of laughs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love this game. I originally bought it for my DSi and had fun playing it on that. I was excited to see it available for the kindle. Lots of variety...some simple, some fun, and some challenging. A great mix of games.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Haney Cavill did a fantastic job. I enjoyed most of the comic based movies of late but not all. This one was great. The cast was superb and the visual were stunning.
B00ESNE696|5.0|This show is wonderful, great characters, constant changes, a great web of intrigue with shocking results. All emotions come into play here, with twists & turns.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Visually stunning. Truly creative story and a great job overall. Honestly there was nothing else on to watch so I decided to rent this but once I started I didn't want it to end.
1439153663|5.0|I am usually not one to read books that are more 'historical'.  I prefer more contemporary 'today' stories.  BUT this one I loved.  It kept my interest through the entire book and I enjoyed learning what some people went through not so long ago.  So sad that people were treated in such a horrible way.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|This movie was actually pretty funny. Jennifer Aniston looked great in every scene. The cast was all around excellent. Great for movie night!
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Classic movie for anyone growing up in the 80s.  Great HD quality.  Nothing scarier than David bowie in tights. Wow
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Can't live without it.  Synching all of my devices perfectly.  and I love being able to share notes with friends.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved it , Cannot wait to see the next on in the series. Love that I can watch it on my kindle fire HD
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|All I can say is Aloysius Pendergast.  That is all you need to know.  Buy this book!  Mining tragedy and ski resort for the ultra-wealthy.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Maggie Smith. Do truly love to watch this grand lady play any part in a movie. She is at the top (or near it) as my favorite actresses. I pray she will have many more years to display her talents on screen. The picture is a wonderful story about her grandson and his adventure he has when he comes to stay with her. Just an awesome family-friendly movie.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I needed a light book for travel reading and chose this based on some very favorable reviews, but I found it really disappointing. It has its moments of humor, but a lot of the attempts at humor just fell flat for me.  Like all the references to vomiting.  I liked the story of a woman coming to grips with her life after a crushing loss, finding her way again with her career, her friends, and her children.  And her ability to love.  There is romance and some moderately steamy scenes, but I found much of it felt contrived, and I didn't quite believe the &#34;surprise&#34; plot twist near the end.  Much of it was tedious to me, such as the plot line regarding changes to her film script and all the people involved.  I have read none of the other Bridget Jones book, so it may be that Fielding's style just doesn't appeal to me and that this would be just the ticket for readers who enjoyed her other books.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is a fun game but it doesn't explain what you should be doing in some of the levels. I'm also a little confused about what the added purchase price will get me. I'm sure it is just me.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|LOVED this story. The cd followed the book almost to a tee. Even so, get it, read it. This stuff really happens(d). The cd's came in a timely fashion in good condition.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|It just so boring and the entire book wAs about Benton and his relatiohship with his boss. The murder was way down the road and we never really heard from the killer until the end of the book. It was like Cornwell realized she was running out of time so oh She had to wrap it up in the last chapter kinda thing. Her last 2 books have been disappointing. I loved her earlier books these of late leave a lot to be desired.
B001YV506S|5.0|no problem with the disk. good delivery and a good story. Not as good a story as Secretariat but it was really good anyway.
B002B3D2TU|5.0|Love the passion of this artist. Unique classical music that really engages my emotions. My husband thinks he is a bit over the top and dramatic, but I love it!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The first song on this CD will totally blow you away!  Why?  Because!  Many songs are alternate recordings of the originals.
B00BGZ8TVA|1.0|Did not enjoy this movie.  All over the artistic beauty could not be ignored, but as an animal lover it was brutal even though it showed the natural concept of survival
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|This was a new twist on the Judge Dredd story as opposed to a remake. I liked the story and the acting. Not a huge special affects movie, but visually appealing.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I think this group is incredible and they have taken our favorite standard Christmas songs and with their pure voices have lifted them high and made them new again....
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Where does he come up with these characters.  It's like he actually knows them from somewhere the a mount of description he gives is Erie.  The top hat and the corpse in the shed just out of the blue.  Talented writer.
B008QYT7DI|1.0|The quality of the audio is not good. There are parts where i cant listen well enough. Please get better this
B00C1040TO|5.0|This app works just fine. I had some free tuners before but everytime I got problems with my microphone and speaker. This nice app works just fine.<br />Metronome is easy to set and works great.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Salena is a great performer.  I attended a concert last week and was totally impressed.  There are always several songs on her releases that are a total surprise.  She is not afraid to take risks and try totally different types of music.  B.E.A.T. is an example, I was just blown away by her ability to pull a song like this off.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's great to be able to get on Facebook with my kindle, only thing is that I can't play a lot of the videos my friends share
B00BATG18K|3.0|Well written as all of Amy Tan's novels are, but feeling a bit formulaic now.  Some of the plot just didn't feel that believable, such as the escape portion.  The story didn't grab me like some of her earlier work, I absolutely loved &#34;The Bonecutter's Daughter&#34;.
B0060YIBLK|2.0|The book was not what I expected.  The personal examples were interesting but seemed more situational that I was looking for
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very easy to use app, it is exactly what I was looking for. I will be using it for work and everyday notes and reminders
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I initially gave this app 1 star because I found it impossible to figure out and/or enjoy.  Turns out that I hadn't used my noggin quite enough to realize how the game was actually played.  It's now one of my favorite games -- I play it at least once a week!
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|Good Sci-Fi movie and CGI. Nice unexpected twist. Enjoyed this movie unlike so many. Wish I had a house like the ones in the movie
B009EEFTMC|5.0|For a quick diversion this is a fun game.  It is timed so you can try and beat your own best time.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I always enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell's books.  Dust is excellent with an interweaving of colorful characters that finally link together at the conclusion.  Cornwell ties the past novels in with the presents.  This makes the novels more personnel to the reader.  I would recommend this book to others to read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the best game out there,  go to the app store and down load this game. you will enjoy this one
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I love my clock for an alarm.  I like picking soothing music to wake up  by each morning.  I reccmmend this app  to others.
B00H1O3XO8|5.0|God I love this show.  It's incredibly well written and acted.  Christine Baranski is fantastic.  Chris Noth (Mister Absafreakingloutely BIG) is amazing.  His Mother is EVIL and I love her. My husband and kids hate this show.  That should tell you how wonderful it is.  It's MY show.  I watch it when they are all asleep and it's my hour to just love this show and relax.  Sit back with your beverage of choice and just savor this wonder hour of entertainment.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I read The Shining (and saw the movie) so long ago that I wasn't sure I would enjoy Doctor Sleep. I was wrong!
B008Q0D32S|2.0|We started watching this movie and were expecting something different, I guess. Lots of great stars in the movie but it just moved too slow. Perhaps it started to pick up speed later but we stopped watching it after about 30 minutes.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey's character is King of the HILL for sure. I loved watching every episode. I wish more politicians were as aggressive as this character.
B001DPC4R8|5.0|This is a fantastic album and the sound quality was really fantastic.  I listen to it often and enjoy the sounds of true heavy vinyl.  You can't really go wrong with the Eagles!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Blu-ray is stunning!  I have other blu-ray discs that are basically mediocre, from what I have learned it all depends on how much money the studios want to spend when doing the transfer, they spent the money on this one.  Great movie, wonderfully acted with superb singing and timeless songs.<br />I've read some reviews where the buyer says the discs won't play.  I've experience first-hand where one bluray player won't play a disc but another player will.  The technology is not perfect.  If a disc won't play there's a 99% chance it is NOT the disc but it IS the player.  At least in my experience.
B000000XB8|5.0|Excellent Sound.  Fast and Secure shipping thanks to Amazon.  Will order more vinyl through this method.  Really enjoying rediscovering the sounds produced from a turntable.
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|I made an assumption that this was BluRay 3D!! WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, It's the old red/blue glasses 3D and very poor at that.
B008FPOIT6|1.0|Silly book. I don't see the purpose. Only reading for a book club. It's trying to be a Harry potter book I guess but not.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|This is an upbeat, beautiful album!  It is just different enough to add some variety to my Christmas music collection.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love kindle books. Waiting in a Dr's office tired or reading 3 year old Highlights magazines??? Not any more. I can be reading Scientific American or a Joe Ledger adventure or Jacinda Wilder's next sexy story.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's better than the film, not because the plot is radically different; not because characters are left out; not because we can't &#34;see&#34; what's happening. It's better than the book because we get to know Katniss on a far more personal level. Her inner dialog is our constant companion throughout the novel, and it makes a huge difference...because suddenly Katniss had motives for her actions and she makes far more sense when you know why she's doing the things she does.<br /><br />Well done.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I am new to the whole WiFi thing. I was having difficulty setting up my WiFi and range extenders around the house Wi-Fi analyzer made it easy to pick locations for every thing to cover every thing perfectly.
B00G32OMF8|4.0|There is a ton of dialogue in this movie, most of which is about human relationships, the failed ones and the lasting ones. It was carefully crafted in the sense of addressing male vs. female differences. However, it is not all that credible in the sense that a male would actually have this much dialogue with anyone especially,  a lover. I would give this one a B-.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My Dad is a super Treky and loved the set. Looks nice.Not sure what else to say with the remaining required words.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|A classical style, draw tile strategy game.  The rules are very simple, but it will take time to master.  Great replay value.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I am a huge fan of these type of games, however, I am not real happy with this one.  Rather confusing to play in my opinion.  I have not deleted it as of yet.  I may try again, but thus far, this is my rating.
1476734941|4.0|I don't do the fast diet, but my husband is trying it, and so far, it's working AMAZINGLY!<br /><br />He uses this book in combination with [[ASIN:B00G5KBC42 Fast Diet Cookbook   5:2 Intermittent Fast Diet Recipes And Meal Plans For Healthy Weight Loss And Vibrant Living]].<br /><br />I've read in several studies that a low calorie diet decreases your risk for cancer, so I'm considering taking up the fast diet soon, especially after seeing the results.
B00AB55BS0|3.0|Please keep in mind I'm rating the product and not the series as a whole. The series is wonderful, the blu-ray on the other hand, is a poorly designed train wreck.<br /><br />There are 5 discs for 10 episodes. The first disc contains 2 episodes and special features. The second disc contains 3 episodes and special features. The third disc contains one episode and special features. The fourth disc contains 3 episodes and special features. The fifth disc contains one episode and special features. To make things even more fun you can select episodes that aren't even on the disc you're currently on for no reason other than to get an &#34;insert disc #&#34; screen.<br /><br />When I buy a series like this it's usually to marathon (and usually while I'm doing other things like working). HBO should have made better use of their disc space and compressed the episodes onto a few discs and the special features onto the remaining discs.<br /><br />So, I personally enjoy the series but the organization of the blu-ray leaves much to be desired.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Such a good movie, such an amazing visual style.  I wish I could comment more on what is included on this blu-ray, such as extra features, but one of my old ex-roommates stole it and sold it for drugs or something a few years ago.  Probably gonna have to buy it again at some point.  :(
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very cool! It was nice to hear one of my favorite songs to wake me, and get an idea for what the weather held in store at a glance. I imagine that song the weather app will complete the ensemble perfectly. Only one problem: the Fire had to be on (asleep), but that's what charges are for right?!!
0762445262|4.0|This is a stocking stuffer for my brother. So we will see how this works. Happy Holidays everyone! YEE HAW!!!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If you're not really a magic person, then I think this movie will be a pleasant adventure for you.  It's fast-paced, original, very clever, and it's pretty good at keeping you guessing while keeping you interested.<br /><br />If you happen to be a magician (or just someone who loves magic) I just want to point out that it is probably the best movie about magic that will ever be produced.  I can't imagine any magician watching this movie without thinking the word: SPECTACULAR.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|The boardgame is good (not excellent but good) and the application is ideal, easy to manipulate, even on a 4'' display, quick and responsive, the AI is good
0920668364|5.0|I have a wild child son. He is now 21 years old. I bought this book for a great nephew.  I read this book to my son MANY, MANY, MANY times. We both loved it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Excellent ending to the trilogy. this whole series was wonderfully put together and shows what a family can do (the women) when they come together!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|We haven't listened to the whole album yet as it is a Christmas gift for my 24 year old son. But I heard parts of the album on David Letterman when Paul McCartney was on the Letterman Show. I'm sure we will enjoy the CD. Hey it's PAUL McCARTNEY need I say more
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Should offer more free play tokens..... otherwise, u could end up spending a ton of $, just to play a 60 second hand of Uno. Also, more boost options &amp; an offline version would be nice. Otherwise, it's a great app! I've been playing Uno with my mom since I was two :) still a favorite.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|My son likes Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. Israel performs Somewhere Over The Rainbow. I don't usually like songs that are &#34;redone&#34;. But I like Israel's version as well as I like Judy Garland's. And Judy Garland is a heck of a singer
B003O86FMW|5.0|💕💕💕💕💕<br />10472929572939 times better than the movie. Just finished reading for the 3rd time and surely not my last MARRY ME PEETA
B008XG1X18|4.0|Plenty of eye candy any time of day.  Broad categories available with an accurate search function.  I make purchase decisions based on Pinterest research.  Can be a time sink but that's. another review.  App works well on my 1st gen Kindle Fire.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great acting, keeps my interest. My wife and I are always ready for the next one. Love having no ads.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simply it works as it is described, do not expected more features if they were not promised.<br />I am using it with Youtube, Netflix, Pandora (from android phone and Nexus tablet) and Chrome browser ( from my laptop) and works flawlessly, except sometimes when my internet connection have some lows, but the device itself is excellent, compared with other LG box device. It is a steal at this price. I bought another Chromecast for my 2nd TV.<br />I expect more third party apps with come sooner than later as happened with HBO and Hulu.<br />The only thing I do not like is that Google is preventing the streaming of media files from your devices at your home network.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game . Is good but not updated enough u can't even have Redstone I would suggest buying pocket investigator pro to make it better
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Pairing up Angry Birds and Star Wars is one of the smartest game combos that Rovio Entertainment has ever came out with!  If you had ever seen all of the Star Wars movies and/or TV shows, this version of Angry Birds is right for you.<br /><br />I love playing this game, and you will love it too!
B005DD7JL2|2.0|The story is bad and the main characters do not look right. It gets two stars from me since the other people looked nice, like Raven, Dragunov, and Eddy. But I seriously don't know what they were thinking when they decided to depict Jin like that and make Kazuya look like that. O.o
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Had trouble getting into the story ... I kept second guessing every character until I found out the &#34;secret&#34; :)  I love the way this author writes but this story line wasn't my cup of tea
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book, fantastic trilogy ! So much better than the movie!! Everyone should read this if they loved the first hunger games
B00EEN66SY|3.0|I don't see why so many people disliked this movie.  It wasn't a deeply personal masterpiece like &#34;Lost in Translation,&#34; but it is a film that told the story of the &#34;bling ring&#34; in a stylistic way that was fitting to the subject matter.  And that's what's the most appealing thing about Sophia Coppola; she is not a one trick pony.  Her vision hinges more on doing the story justice than keeping to a tried and true formula.
B007KGXY0K|1.0|The board doesn't even _know_ how to spell \\"Stable\\".<br /><br />It might be ok with other graphics cards, but With the GTX780, I'm lucky to get it to boot to Windows.<br /><br />Frequently, if it DOES get into Windows, all I get is a black screen when Windows tries to initialize the graphics card.<br /><br />The worst problem is with SLOT 1- which is where you're SUPPOSED to put the graphics card.<br /><br />It boots alright 1/3-4 times in Slot 3, and about the same in slot 5 and 7.<br /><br />This board is DESIGNED to be used in high performance PC's- what on earth is the problem with Asus?<br /><br />Clearing the bios, flashing to the latest, getting the latest graphics drivers, using the latest windows (8.1)- none of this has made a difference.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Kind of slow, pacing is very southern like eating cheese grits. It's a perfect role for Matthew-but then he's comfortable in a suit or dirty jeans. Parts of it sad, some of it is coming of age, it held my attention for 2 hours!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|eWeather is a weather junkie's dream app. It is flexible, intelligently put together, and very stable. If course, if you actually want a weather app in order to accumulate mPoints, you'll need The Weather Channel's program. If however, you want to keep track of the weather where your favourite relatives live or places you simply live, this is the only one you need.
B003U51EE8|5.0|love this show - very addictive - very strange, but still very interesting to watch.  Sorry it will end in a few more (recorded) seasons =(
0756404746|5.0|For those who love a richly imagined and written fantasy with complex characters and a many-threaded plot, this is for you! Imagine the first six &#34;Dresden&#34; books condensed into one story with a healthy dash of the last couple of Harry Potter books and you still haven't comprehended what Rothfuss pulls off in one book. Kvothe, like both Harrys, is an orphan with powers that he has yet to develop or even understand. At a precocious age, he manages to be accepted to the University where such powers are studied - no Hogwarts, but a cut-throat graduate school where the price of doing a potion wrong or offending a professor or another student could be death or worse, madness. But Kvothe is more concerned with the mysterious beings who killed his family - a people so jealous of their secrecy that even to mention their name can bring retribution on an entire village. I had to read this book twice to feel like I'd scratched the surface of all that Rothfuss gives us, and I anticipate many happy re-reads of the trilogy once it's completed.
1781162646|5.0|Dear Stephen King,<br /><br />Thank you so much for not publishing this book for Kindle or E-readers.  You forced me to actually purchase a BOOK, and I have been giddy with “Joy,” reading it.  I even dog eared the pages!!  Thank you for putting an actual book back into my hands – it felt so comfortingly familiar.<br /><br />And thank you for the “Joy” I got from reading this book.  All those hoity-toity Pulitzer Prize winning types can’t hold a candle to you.  YOU the Master!  And thank-you for reminding me why I started loving reading in the first place.<br /><br />Your devoted reader.<br />EMK
B00F35BV64|1.0|This was an extremely disappointing movie.  I &#34;discovered&#34; Benedict Cumberbatch from watching the &#34;New Sherlock Holmes.&#34;  Thank heaven he was in this movie because without his skill and presence, it would have fallen flatter than it does.  Overacting by Scotty, too many people wearing blue contact lenses (especially Kirk...way too bright) and very distracting, terrible plot (what plot?), why did Leonard Nimoy suddenly appear as the old Spock, and so on and so on...it was just awful!!!!!!!  Save your money.  Don't bother wasting your time either!  Carole Von Alten
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|Hard to put this book down.  It is a beautiful story of a terrible time in history.  Hopefully the movie holds true to the book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing solitaire with this game or a real deck of cards. There are several options of the kind of deal you want. I use random deal at the harder level, but if you want a winning hand you can have that too. There are not a lot of screens to wade through  before you can play.They follow after a few games.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It is fun to play and my kids both like to play angry birds.  It isn't one of their favorite games.
0141345659|5.0|My daughter loves this author and read this book in record time.  She is 13 so she found it very enjoyable!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is my favorite photo editing app. You get tons of free frames, effects, stickers, backgrounds, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now, plus you can download more for free in a shop built into the app(there's like five packets that cost but still). I've tried other apps and they confuse me. This is very simple to use and is the best you can get without paying for it. I would even say this is the equivalent of any payed app you could find. It works great on my kindle fire. It's really fun to just play with editing. I've also done multiple photoshoped edits with this app.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book so much! I have read it like 20 times! It is my favorite of them all. Personally I think it has more action.
B00G6ZTM3Y|2.0|I can't see why people like this game. It's not fun.... Building, digging... It seems the beginning is boring and the rest is ok... but the beginning is hard to go thru.... Play the trial, if you dig this game buy it... don't buy it just because others like it...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can not stop playing it :-D<br />Me and my friends love it and can not stop.<br />So many cool things
1572815108|5.0|Gorgeous art, colorful & deep in it's symbolism. One of the best decks you could possibly hope to come by. Wish I could get these pieces in poster size.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I was unable to watch the series when it originally played.  So I am catching up on it now.  It is a very interesting series that continues to keep me interested
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I'm a pretty big James Bond fan and I've seen most of the movies AT LEAST twice with the exception of the last Pierce Brosnan film & Quantum of Solace or whatever that one was called. I am a big fan of Daniel Craig as Bond. This film is by far the darkest James Bond to date. Craig delivers, and Dame Judi Dench plays her most extensive role in a Bond film and is excellent. Javier Bardem is one of the creepiest and most sinister Bond villains to date.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its fun oh yah real fun Yahoo its fun its fun fun funny fun fun yummy tum dimity tum tum its argaflargitarg fun that's really fun if you know what I mean.
0547884591|5.0|I got the hard copy at a discount I think. I haven't read it, and I will probably never read it cover-to-cover, but it's really quite stunning visually. I usually leave the book hanging around as a cookbook and a &#34;pick me up and look at the glossy pictures.&#34;
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was a weak third book. I was hoping for less filler and more substance. I didn't find the ending to finish the adventure at all satisfying. Too many unanswered questions and I thought it was totally unnecessary to kill off the main character. The book just left me - empty and wondering why I had slogged through it at all.
1936891026|4.0|This was a nice book but it wasn't great. I heard about the book & Steven Pressfield on JRE (& heard his episode). It is very well written, but in many ways it is a stereotypical &#34;self-motivation&#34; book, so there are no secrets to be had. I think the subtitle is a little misleading, and corny. The book is well-written and it is laid out nicely - even though it's a rehash of a lot of other self-help stuff, it's a fresh perspective and Pressfield does a GREAT job introducing some concepts, and more importantly, thoroughly expounding upon them in a nice fashion. The two concepts that stood out to me were his deep quasi-personification of &#34;Resistance&#34; and the idea that we are afraid of being successful. It's worth a read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I only wish the movie had followed it better. I've read the series somewhere between 3-5 times, I've lost count. But it never gets old. There's always something new I didn't remember from before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun. It cheers me up, I don't know how, but it does... I recommend this game because it's a way to make time fly by. Also it's free!!!!!!!!!!!
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|Classic Hitchcock with chilling twists and death defying ending.  The media froze in the middle on my Roku and had to restart finding where I left off.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to play keeps . You entertained for hours i recommend this game to everyone its not to easy but not to hard
B008Y7IFSA|1.0|This is missing the song and sceen &#34;when love is gone&#34; so is a waste of time to view much less buy. It is ruined since this song is related directly to the last song and sceen &#34;when love is found. What a waste all because Disney thinks you just have to have their films no matter what. Dear old  Walt is rolling in his grave because of the way Disney is managed in this day and time. Really a shame.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Awesome game. Can't stop playing I install in my phone to : ) it's good for kid lot to learn about animal
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites!  Bill Murray is fantastic!  And I love Andie McDowell.  Great life lessons in this one!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Awesome game! Heroes are so helpful all of them are good,some more fun then others. All new towers to blast enemies away!
B0045DO85Q|2.0|The CD appears to have lots of skips in it where the music will drop out occasionally making listening to it a very frustrating experience.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|It totally reaches my expectation. The price is good, and the quality is good. It is a smart order, I guess.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|more rebus please..........<br /><br />I don't care how old he is but he must solve many more cases!!<br />wonderfully written and easy to read.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|One of the greatest movies I've ever seen! Why? Because this movie has everything what you need for a spectacular view. Actors are not superstars, but it's the least important aspect in movie if you have everything else in it's places. The acting is great, special effects are superb, filming and directing has nothing more to add to. The story line is not new or something what you have never heard before in different interpretations. What I love is that even the story is simple, but the presentation and implementation of it is made the best way I could imagine!<br /><br />James Cameron is the director of this movie, and what I love about him is that he has an incredible ability to make masterpieces while many other directors can just make something. One of the most admirable things is that this movie, Avatar, changed the course of movies industry. James Cameron showed everyone that movies can be watched in 3D. He didn't invented 3D technology and I know that. Steve Jobs didn't invented many things too. What makes these 2 men similar and what makes me admire them and their works is the ability to make great masterpieces and change the course of history!<br /><br />I greatly recommend this movie to everyone!
B0035HKWLW|5.0|I didn't watch it, but my 10 yr old daughter did.  She loved it so much that when I woke up the next day I discovered her up and streaming it on her iPad. Turns out she had sneaked and stayed up all night watching it over and over and never went to bed! Needless to say she got in trouble.  Seeing as how it was thanksgiving day I went light on her punishment (holiday rules) :) I wasn't really mad at her but I let her think I was because I can't have her waiting till everyone's asleep to get out of bed and rent movies on my amazon account. (I know, bad parenting on my part for sharing my log in information with a kid, but I work nights and my husband works days so if I'm at work and they want to rent a movie she has to log him in! LOL he's hopeless :) but it's okay, for the most part she's a good kid and usually she is very trustworthy. She still feels bad for taking advantage of her &#34;grown up&#34; responsibility and has been a model child trying to make it up to me.  To reward her (even though she did a bad thing) because she took responsibility  for her wrong choice and I believe she learned from her mistake,(and for that I am very proud of her) I plan on buying the movie for her for Christmas.  It's not very often that she decides to do something sneaky I'm just happy that it only costed me about $3.  We all know it could have been worse, I'm mean come on I'm 33 I know better than to give a little kid unlimited  access to my accounts I'm very lucky my kid is a better kid than I was.  Like my daughter I didn't act out often, but unlike my daughter who on the rare occasions that she does make poor choices does it on a small scale, when I was a kid on the very rare occasions that I decided to do something that I new was wrong, I went all out.  If I was going to be punished I was going to make sure it was dang well going to be worth it. :) enjoy the movie. I'm told it's very funny ;)
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|It keeps your attention, has a good psychological story with a good balance of action.  And you can't wait for the next episode!
B00G70WLJA|5.0|The Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) gets some history.  Don't let your girl friends see him naked because normal men can't compare to his perfect physique.  Yes, those abs are for real.  He gets a Body guard, one he really likes and respects. I've watched the movie three times already and come away with something new each time. Yeah, there are special effects to wow you. There is also a great plot. Every time I see the scene with the wounded Bear, I get a twinge in my eye at the insanity of the hunting crowd.  I feel that hunter got what he deserved. If nothing else, that scene brought this movie into the sublime category.  I highly recommend it, 5 stars.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I'd read the rest of the series and wanted to find out what happens next and anyone contemplating this book is likely in the same situation and willing to buy the book regardless of my review, especially now that it is being discounted heavily. But man does this book DRAG. It has been a 2-year gap since I read the book that comes before this one (remember that the last book parallels this book so we are going two books back to the prequel). The book dances between multiple character threads and locations, referencing plot developments that have faded in my memory. And it just goes on and on and on with angst-ridden wanderings and plots with little in the way of action. I'm writing this at about the 1/3 point in the book so maybe things will pick up. If you've read the rest of the series you're going to have to read this one but it isn't literature.<br /><br />[Edit] I am editing this review after having just finished the book. The edit includes a downgrade from two stars to one and this additional material. This book is just horrible and I feel like I am being held hostage to whatever Martin wants to do because I'd invested my time in the previous volumes and the story lines. I wanted to find out what happens to characters with whom I've built relationships but still no joy and no resolutions. This book has no fewer than eight different plot lines going and each chapter jumps from one to another meaning that continuity within the book suffers. Further, many of the plot lines are left over from previous volumes and given the time gap between this one and the latest it was difficult for me to remember what was going on the last time we visited some of the characters. Further, the plot is dispersed so widely in both geography and characters that I am frankly having trouble keeping many of the minor players straight.<br /><br />Martin has woven a world that I am sure he understands but if you are looking for something to read with an ending don't look to this series. Instead, this is more like a multi-year TV show where you have to just tune in week after week to see what happens. But instead of following a close cast of characters through ongoing adventures Martin has created his full employment program by just broadening his world. I'd have much rather he had created spin offs so I could at least have some resolution on part of the story.<br /><br />I'll probably buy the next one, if it ever comes out. But I certainly won't pay full price for it. I'll wait again until it is deeply discounted for Kindle.<br /><br />For what it is worth, this is the worst review I've ever left and am not someone who goes around looking for problems or complaining just to complain. But I resent having my investment in this story and characters hijacked into a vehicle to sell me this unsatisfying content.stead, this is more like a multi-year TV show where you have to just tune in week after week to see what happens.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wouldn't give this book even one star if there was a zero rating. I describe it as glorified pseudo porn with the readability level of a fourth grader. I think most women in this country might have read it or pretended to because it was the &#34;in thing&#34; to do and it was an easy read. We love to snicker and giggle about sex. After all we are liberated gals, so the degrading manner in which this book's silly young girl goes to please her rich boyfriend is a sick level to which we all aspire. Wow!  Can't decide whether to watch the movie version or just break out the old digitally remastered copy of Deep Throat. Decisions, decisions.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Love Rose and the Doctor... such a great series and very addictive.  I'm all the way through Season 2 and plan to continue watching these in my spare time, on da plane and on da boat...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game has the feel of a bizarre retro 60s acid trip. But it is seductively addictive. I love/hate the delayed gratification when you have to wait for your next lives to kick in, though the voice saying 'Sweet' I find slightly disturbing.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Excellent sound.  Very comfortable. Fits perfect in my ear.  I would buy again.  Quality product.  Just need to keep it out of reach of puppy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This resource wait/build unit wait/attack game is pretty much what you would expect. It's fun to waste time for free, but to &quot;win&quot; you will have to spend money.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|love it; I got hooked and could not stop watching it non- stop for several weeks. the movie is also great
B00G21XNKU|5.0|I was nice to be able to see this episode almost right after it aired.<br />David Tennant returns! for this episode
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Hugh Jackman is perfectly cast and Anne Hathaway, though I am typically not a fan of hers, blows me away every time I watch. While the film version of the stage classic is certainly not perfect, it is a sweeping, emotional, powerful movie - worth a watch whether you are a fan of the show or not.
0062238868|5.0|Very interesting book!  Wish I had met the author before his untimely departure.  Rest in peace Chris and may God bless his family!
B009POCFTG|4.0|This movie based on the fantastic play by Tracy Letts is just as haunting and hilarious as the stage version. I'm not big on Matthew but he really charmed me as Joe - the rest of the cast is unbeatable. Don't watch it with your parents, but this disturbing gem is definitely worth a watch.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Seemed slow in the middle. Think Daniel Craig makes a great Bond but the script was nothing special. Easy to watch.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This romantic epic went completely undetected at the box office - despite the fact that everyone I know who has seen it has been completely swept away! A stellar cast, great direction and writing, and a gorgeous score. A new favorite.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's quite slow. I think it should be able to be played w/o having to be on Facebook. Have that be an option not a necessity. Maybe it moves quicker as I level.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app! I use it for all my cake photos I post on Facebook.  My photos and collages look amazing.  Thx picsart!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The insight to the prison system was informative. And the main character was well developed. Her interactions with other prisoners was also interesting.  Makes you wonder about what purpose our prisons serve
0307454568|5.0|Must have read the previous two books; it has a different name in the original text but overall the translation is niecely done.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is addicting!  And the music, while annoying, is addicting too.  I like to play this game when I'm waiting somewhere.
B00CO5AQ12|3.0|This posting is very misleading. The listing says its 2.2 lbs but the image shows 176 oz (11lbs). Also much cheaper on fatbraintoys.com. You get the whole 11lbs for $45. So not sure if the 2.2lbs is a misprint for that price or if they didn't upload the correct picture of what you're buying. :/
0307279189|2.0|I honestly don't see what all of the hype is about. Now, I should preface this review by telling you that I am *NOT* a marathoner, ultra or otherwise. I run to stay in shape, maybe 4-5 miles at a time. I have no designs upon EVER running a marathon- it's just not something that I want or plan to do. Now, I understand that there ARE people who friggin' LOVE to run, and I think that this books was written to appeal to that audience. Because I honestly don't get it. As a piece of literature it just didn't engage me, hold my attention, force me to care about either the characters or the narrative, or entertain. I just honestly didn't care about anything that was going on, and only laughed at the occasional 'F-word'. I understand that barefoot running is all the rage right now and this book makes some good cases for it, but it does so in such a convoluted way that I'd much rather read reports from reputable news sites on the Internet than learn about a new running technique from this story.<br /><br />All in all, I just don't understand what all of the hype is about. Some of the other reviews are saying that they read this book as a school assignment… really!?!? THIS is what our kids are being given to read in school (or college) nowadays??!!? That, more than anything, was a big shocker to me.
B008JFUS0U|4.0|The film opens with the defeat of Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with darkness called &#34;the ether&#34; apparently a hater of the cinema. He is defeated and the ether is hidden somewhere deep where it can't be found. Then the movie title hits the screen: &#34;Thor: The Dark World.&#34; Not too hard to figure this one out and since Natalie Portman doesn't work for bus fare, you can bet she will be prominent in the film.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth provides us with some early beefcake moments for what is a borderline chick flick. I found Darcy (Kat Dennings) to be the most entertaining character in the film, too bad she was underutilized. The film excelled in special effects, but had a plot we could figure out before the title flashed on the screen, minus some details. Thor was played rather stiffly and made Loki (Tom Hiddleston) likeable. The writers need to lighten him up.<br /><br />Worth a view on the big screen. We will all add this to our growing Avengers' collection, although I might wait for a price drop on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is a Must have this wonderful game so addictive and best game on the market right now!!! Download download download download!!!!
B000PVAFT0|4.0|great cinema photography. amazing film of weird creatures under the sea. They could do another half hour and it still would have been good.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Typical  Cornwall. Thriller.  Having trouble putting it down.  Slow start but picks up quickly and hooks the reader.  Tempted to cheat by reading the finish
B00BL5YQKS|4.0|I'm glad I started watching this show. Production is a little rough, but writing is awesome. You can feel Kurt Sutters' (Sons of Anarchy) hands in this show.<br /><br />Looking forward to watching the whole series. It's only going to get better - I can feel it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is addicting. Absolutely Love it! Home on medical leave and I can't put it down. Lots and lots of fun!
0738737909|5.0|Beautiful cards and high quality printing on the book.  The depth of color and design are wonderful.  I also prefer the 74 card deck, which this is.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|Kids love the movie, it was as good as the movie Disney Cars and Cars 2. Mostly my kids like this type of movie.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|This was a fantastic end to a wonderful series.  Atwood once again gives us elegant language even as she describes brutality, vulgarity, and some truly awful people.  I love that each book tells us more about characters from much earlier, and was thrilled that there were pizzlies and groalars--Atwood's research is impeccable.  I'm just sorry that the series is over.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the type of game you spend hours and hours trying to finish it.<br />It makes you think everytime you finish each level.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|We could not contain ourselves! Hilarious movie..This is a must see for those seeking good laughs ;-) dysfunctional families are the best.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is an excellent sequel to The Shining.  Little Danny grows up to be a not very nice man.  However, circumstances change before his next encounter with evil.  I really got into this one and found myself near tears a couple of times.  King does enough foreshadowing to keep you nervous and anxious to turn the page.  If you haven't read the Shining, take the time to read it first.
B00FQU8XTE|5.0|Awesome album! The audio and video are beautiful! All my friends who have seen this are in awe. I encourage you to try this beautiful Christmas experience!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|While the subject matter is challenging, the very real conversation and teenage attitude are beautifully done.  A completely different coming-of-age story.
006202406X|5.0|loved the book. came in perfect condition much faster than i had expected. let my friends borrow it and they loved it too. read the first two books before hands though
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Pretty addicting, but not much more than that.  I think you'd be better off with the Simpsons game ... more people play that one, and there are more progress points.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|We watched it on are NEW 55&#34; smart tv & it was AMAZING. We had some trouble w/ it pausing to download several times during the movie, but other than that it was great.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A fun, engaging read.  A great way for young adults to get exposure to theories of leadership and strategy.  I found the post-climax portion of the book to be a strange and a little distracting.  But all in all, pretty entertaiing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is fabulously acted and staged. Each actor beautifully portrays the characters believably and richly. The setting is gorgeous and transports us into another era. The story line is engaging and detailed. I love everything about this series.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not nearly as fun now that they've pushed so many new adds into the game.  But the game itself is great.  I'd say it's worth paying to have the ads removed.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Sycamore row was a really good book the end was the best it took a big turn of events. Middle got a little boring. Overall it was a good book.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Follows the same Dan Brown formula, which makes it easy to make quick progress through the book.  I bought this book because I thought the Masons would be a welcome change from his endless inventions around Christianity.  But about half way through the book, Brown takes a turn back to those familiar stomping grounds, and I very quickly lost interest.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|A very fun game that makes passing time in an airport bearable. I am glad I got it add the free app of the day. Awesome on my galaxy s4.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fantastic book!  Starts out like a good relationship-type of novel .... then it gets a little cray.  An enjoyable read for both men and women.
B000XR4OC0|3.0|I love these shoes, they are so cute but after wearing it for not even 6 months, maybe once a week or less, I got a hole in the shoe.. Too embarrassing to still wear them now. It also kept rubbing against my heel and opened the skin, which was an easy fix by getting the heel cushions, but still, it took me a while before I found a solution. I really want to get another pair, but it's not worth it if it doesn't last me longer than a few months.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|If you like Divergent, Hunger Games, Legend, then the Maze Runner is for you.  As long as you can handle a distopian future where there's a male lead and not a female lead.  Short chapters make this a quick read.  Get it now!
067144901X|5.0|Moo Baa La La La is one of my daughter's favorite books.  We have read this book many, many times.  I would certainly recommend this book to others.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The 50 pages when you find out the secret are great ...but it took a long time to get to the secret, and a long time to end after.  I'm not sure what all the book-hype is about.  A lot of publications put this on their summer reading list - which seems way off to me.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|For not being a suspense/thriller novel, I was surprised by how much I kept constantly turning the pages & not wanting to put the book down.  The author's writing & overlapping of how the characters lives intertwined (even before they knew it) was great!  I've told many friends about this book already.  Personally I don't think you can go wrong with any of Liane Moriarty (author) books.
B00GX598FO|5.0|Great all around movie.  Loved it!  Will recommend to family and friends.  John Malkovich is spectacular in this movie.  Classic
B004H4XDBI|3.0|If you read &#34;If I stay&#34; (which I highly recommend), then you'll understand & enjoy this book more.  I would have given it more stars, but the 1st book was so much better that I had to stick with 3.  It's a great, easy & quick read. Perfect for a plane ride or obviously if you read the first book & want to know where things went from there.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I'm not finished with it yet, but so far it's great.  I've been reading it while I'll at work in between calls.
B00FQRWORE|5.0|This is a western with a difference. Alex Walsh, a 32-year-old Englishman, sets off in 1875 with his daughter to set up a cobbler business in America. On the voyage over, he meets Mr Ford, a cattle rancher, and his daughter, Susan, the love interest of the tale. The town they settle in has been taken over by the Black Hand Gang in preparation for a major train heist. Through curious episodes involving thundering hooves and snatches of blue ethereal smoke, Alex eventually comes into contact with Free Spirit, a spirit horse who guards the roads and who tasks him with maintaining the balance in the world between good and evil. He is specifically tasked with taking out the gang, and is taught how to 'spirit walk' between this world and the spirit realm, and consequently become invisible. This stands Alex in good stead when the story rises to its bloodcurdling crescendo of a finale in a series of vicious fights with members of the Black Hand Gang and allied demons. A western with a real difference and a terrific punch. Check it out.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Easy to learn how to play this version but it does leave out a few options that should be available. If you have no people left and you complete a road or cloister that you are on. You should be able to place that piece after the scoring has given you your point for completing your road or cloister. Right now you do not get that option. Are there options to upgrade to the different expansions?
B00AYW0ICY|3.0|Good, but not as good as some of his previous books, but is it one of the few books that I got all the way thought recently, so that (in my opinion) says something.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|love the product works great on any tv.  bought two for each of the kids room. now they can watch netflix on thier tvs
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is just all around, incredible! My definite favorite of the trilogy. Mostly because it's differently thought out and very detailed.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is the best movie ever, and every man needs to see it. So, buy it when you have the chance.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good read, I woke up a couple times in the middle of thee night.  I would go out to the couch and read a litte.  That's my definition of a fun,thrilling book.  Good story line,plot & unique characters.  I literally judged this book by its cover previously.  There's a picture of a girl with a mohawk and I thought I'm not going to read that.  52 years old and I'm still learning, I'm a knucklehead :-)
B001OFJPIS|3.0|This is a great movie, but the digital copy is expired... that is some thing that should be known before buying.
B003Y5USG4|5.0|While some things might be hokey, this is one of my favorite movies. The characters are well rounded and for the most part, I wish I were friends with them. I even named my dog after Dusty (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). This is probably one of the most quoted movies in our house - &#34;Roll the maps.&#34; &#34;What road is this? Bobs road?&#34; Okay, I could fill this up with quotes, but I won't. Buy the movie. Rent the movie. Or do what I did. Buy the DVD, rent it on Amazon (prime!), and buy a digital copy. Whatever works - or all of the above. Also, the screenplay is excellent for structure, if you're into that sort of thing.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Explains the problem with gluten and has great recipes for healthy gluten free alternatives that don't rely on rice flour predominantly.
1465414444|5.0|This is a great gift book for World of Warcraft players and fans of all ages.  It takes you through the history of what was originally called just \\"Warcraft\\", up to the Panderia expansion.  You will see nice drawings of non-playable characters in the game, with some background information on each one, as well as where to find them in the game world.  The only complaint I have about it is that the 'behind the scenes' section seems more like a sales promotion of WoW memorabilia than a real, in-depth behind the scenes look at the Blizzard company, how it was formed, what their computer system is like, who are the designers and support people, etc.  I would have liked to see more about this type of information in that section.  Other than that, it would make a nice gift or coffee-table book for the WoW enthusiast!
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|This movie was laugh out loud funny.  Numerous segments were uncomfortable to watch, and it is a bit crude, but hilarious.  I would definitely recommend this movie to watch for great laughs if you're not afraid of swearing and crude humor.
B00BJ9AYHU|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the performance on which this cd is based at the Salzburg Witsun Festival in 2011. It was marvelous then and remains so on hearing it again.<br /><br />The plot is a sequel to  the Marriage of Figaro. The libretto is by Felice Romani -- who provided many fine librettos for Mercadante, Donizetti (e.g. L'Eliser d'Amore), Bellini (e.g. Norma), Verdi (Un Giorno di Regno), Rossiini  (Il Turco in Italia, but not The Barber) and many other Bel canto composers. It is based on a French play, but not one by Beaumarchais. Possibly for that reason, the libretto is not up to the quality the Marriage of Figaro, but it may also be that there was no joint work with the composer which characterized the Mozart-da Ponte endeavoour. Indeed, the libretto had been used earlier by other composers. Nevertheless, the libretto provides a fine opera buffo, and whole it lacks both the depth and the humanity of the Marriage of Figaro, it is superior to any number of libretti that were set in the bel canto era to great success.<br /><br />Musically, I due Figaro is much more a sequel to Rossini's Barber of Seville that to Mozart's Masterpiece. It was composed in 1826 when other composers were beginning to break away from the Rossini mould, and Mercadante certainly demonstrates that tendency. While much of the opera is pure imitation of Rossini -- and very good imitation indeed -- though enriched by liberal use of Spanish rhythms, some of the individual arias and duets break away very effectively from Rossini, and in ways that are Mercadante's own. This leads to an opera which is enlightening as well as being highly satisfactory.<br /><br />For this production Ricardo Muti, who seems to have been the guiding force behind bringing this opera to the stage after a very long period of neglect, has assembled a first-rate cast of young, but nevertheless accomplished, singers. Their voices individually are outstanding and they blend together most satisfactorily while retainingenough individuality that the different characters are easily distinguished aurally. None stands out as the star of the show, but rather they all do. The chorus is fine -- better than one might expect in a festival recording, and the youthful orchestra plays magnificently. Muti's conducting strikes me as being just right.<br /><br />Overall, then, this is a wonderful recording. I think it is the best recording of a Mercadante opera available -- and I have most of them, and many are indeed very fine.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|My grandkids really like this game and play it often when they are spending the night with me. Great game!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Cornwell seems to have lost her way. This book drags on at snail's pace, enlivened only occasionally by miscellaneous facts and comments deriving from her scientific knowledge. The characters are poorly developed, large bits that would tie the parts of the plot together coherently seem to have been left out and the conclusion is pulled from a hat with little logic or interest. One would be far better off reading her first half dozen or so novels rather than this poor rehash.
B005K17RU0|1.0|New update and look is awful. Bring back the old format. All the best features that were on the prebvious version are now gone.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Cheaper than a new DVD Burner and External HD! I really don't notice any speed issues on the old 24x burner.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Good movie excellent acting (Denzel of course). ended like I knew it would would watch again. well recommended for all except the very young
B003TQKVGU|4.0|How bible was referenced when explaining subconscious power<br />The book has a lot of practical techniques to assist with mastering subconscious
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is adorable. You build habitats and raise dragons to watch them float around on your island. Some parts depend on interaction with other users. Would be great for kids. I find it a nice distraction. My only complaints would be that, the more going on at once, the harder it is for the kindle fire to process and keep up. My kindle will also be a little behind in posting updated tasks in the menu. It can sometimes be hard to catch up on breeding all of the specialty and limited edition dragons so you may miss out on ever having a complete set. That is, of course, unless you are willing to purchase 'gold' in-app. I still give it five stars :)
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Love the whole series ! The Twighlight Saga is the best, it just hits something inside that not to many of us can deny :  )
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This so cool. It's just like the computer edition. I love  the items ,pets, the dungeon,and the different areas in the game.
B00ESB6GBY|2.0|The never ending lead up to the wedding is getting old. I guess they changed the concept so no one would miss it when it ends.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|i got this movie in really good time. i have a couple i ordered after this and they were fedex and this ups. i am still waiting for fedex packages. the fact is amazon and ups goes well together. keep up the good work.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|People think nothing of being on insulin, statins, or having gastric bypass. Yet, we give such little consideration to the thing we all know makes us fat and causes metabolic diseases: eating fattening carbohydrates. Gary Taubes does a great job of explaining the science and rationale of a low carbohydrate way of eating.
B008OOYALE|5.0|THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!!! Best game I ever played. Everyone should play this AWESOME game. Put down your old fashion books and play this. I play this 24-7.
B001V9LPY4|5.0|I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE. I dont understand how this movie out of all the Miyazaki movies is not on blu-ray
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Fun flick.  Plot reminiscent of Ghostbusters. Good escape. Very enjoyable.  Great cast.  Something for everyone.  And come on...it's got Ryan Reynolds!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 of the grey books were the best!!!!! I.<br />I didn't want to stop reading them. I can't wait to see the movie
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|AMAZING!  I have an old samsung galaxy sii phone I am using as my wireless device to cast movies to this and it plays on my projector flawlessly. For anyone with an older device and a smartphone or other WIFI device that can access streaming media, this is the ticket.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I laughed out loud at times.  Great read.  It was hard to accept that Mark was dead though.  You just don't expect Bridget to be a widow.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Riveting great read. I am on the second book and have a hard time putting it down. Sometimes a great book comes along that you can put yourself in and live with the character and this is one of those.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|An awesome album by Lady Gaga as always.. takes really looking into the lyrics to understand it. Its so powerful, it sets you free. I love it :)
B0002XMKYE|5.0|close interpratation of one of the greatest Generals in History he belongs in same catagory as Chesty Puller USMC and Gen. James Mattis
B0081SRJSY|5.0|The game mechanics seem very close to how a real life version would play out. Interface isn't the most clear, but after a couple games with trial and error it's not hard to figure things out.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|This is a great album. LOVE LOVE LOVE his music!! Plz keep making more albums. I will definitely buy another.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|You can not put it down!  I have run my battery down 3 times while playing. A must down load for the whole family!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is a great album. LOVE LOVE LOVE his music!! Plz keep making more albums. I will definitely buy another.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|The storyline and cast was very good. When watching this movie, the cast did a good job making the story feel 'this real life stuff'.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|I like Donna Tartt's work although this one had a little too much detail. The story line was great but you had to work at it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. Highly entertaining with a good storyline that didn't get to lost in the historical stuff where you were bored to death. This was my second attempt at reading a King book, the first was Under the Dome and that book just had to many characters for me to follow. Like his style though and was a good first book to get used to his novels.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Very funny movie for kids as well as adults, enjoyed every minute of it. Computer animation has come along way in the last 10 years and it shows in this story.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I was curious to find out what all of the hoopla was about. It was pretty much what I expected. Science Fiction fun and imagination. Engaging main characters. Nowhere near as cheesy as early Star Trek. The video quality was good and it streamed smoothly for the most part, but the music often overwhelmed the dialog.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is absolutely the best puzzle site. I have tried them all and none even come close. The pieces are a nice size and are not all over the board. They are on the side and you can scroll up and down to find pieces. The edge pieces can be separated  so you can do them first. There are hundreds of puzzle  and lots of nice free ones. You get a month's worth of free hidden puzzles which is fun because you  never know what the picture will be. The puzzles are all beautiful and from all over the world.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|I'm just not falling for these characters...they seem incredibly contrived.  Good characters that and audience falls for feel like they might actually exist on some level.  I'll keep watching for now in hopes that some decent character building is coming.  They are failing miserably so far.
B002KYGLVQ|4.0|It's totally campy, but I love this movie. The action fighting is great, and the bad guys are exactly what you would expect.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|An amazing show!!!!  I can't get enough of it! Just caught up on season 3.  I just love the twists and turns on this show.  You never quite know what's going on.  The actors are playing new characters on the show and they are in a  new location and time.  In an asylum in the 1960's run by a bunch of nuns.  The religious overtones are strong and so are all the sexual scenes. Rape,murder, torture, scientific experimenting, aliens, demons, angels of death.  There's so much going on!!!!  I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of horror or psychological thrillers.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|An okay version, I bought it to have a digital copy in addition to the very nice physical copy that I have in my library.
B004SIP7XK|5.0|To repeat the title of my review: this blu-ray has excellent hi-def picture quality and is a great film overall! With plot twists and turns, and yet highly realistic and thus very believable, it is based on a great book by a man had worked in the child welfare arena.<br /><br />This has a very engrossing story centering on the kidnapping of a small girl, with her addict mother's lack of cooperation and bad ways hindering the investigation, indeed, possibly being a reason the kidnapping occurred successfully in the first place.  With some mildly unclear byplay between the couple who are private investigators and the police force.  The story is an unusual one in movies in the sense that it seems as if the entire story is over with 2/3 of the way into the film; but, then, at that point, it's as if it REALLY starts.  This movie keeps your attention, although easily-- not requiring you to scrutinize every second (or else you'll miss something), but instead, it's an easy viewing.  The plot twists are just interesting, unique, and well-acted.  Despite this, REALISM is the order of the day here-- the true good and bad in life.<br /><br />The blu-ray quality is beautiful: sharp, detailed, beautiful color, and very realistic; you're watching a movie in hi-def but it looks realistic, not ultra bright or color-saturated for HD, instead just excellent and not provoking thoughts about the picture quality one way or the other. The sound is excellent as well, and I don't have exterior speakers or a sound bar, just my TV's own speakers.<br /><br />This is one of the finest movies I've seen in the last 20 years, ultra-professional and creative in every detail, and you stay riveted to the end; and yet, as I might expect, it's selling for only $6.00 in blu-ray, because a large number of Americans would rather see plot-less and pointless \\"fun\\" entertainment requiring no directorial, screenwriting, or acting talent, such as a Kardashian TV show. A very well-crafted film such as this, conversely, is apparently not very popular, although based on a fine book and having benefited from ALL of the above talents in excess; no, this film is evidently of little interest to the American public today.<br /><br />What a pity.<br /><br />Let the \\"crowd\\" continue to flock to the next ultra-stupid Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson garbage, or another Ben Stiller movie where he plays the same wide-eyed, dumb schnook, as he always does. Me, I'll instead give all kudos to the cast and director of Gone Baby Gone, and will seek out more movies from those involved, such as Ben and Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Ed Harris, all of whom, for years, could always be counted on for believable and superior performances. And Ben, for simply superb direction as well.
0765357151|4.0|I bought it after seeing both the Will Smith version, as well as the original Omega Man movie adaptation with Charlton Heston and very much enjoyed it. The infected are much more interesting than in either of the movie versions.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|While it exposed some subtle under the radar information.....<br />and the political intrigues of various events/people....it can feel labored where<br />making a point becomes the objective  (maybe journalism to convince).<br />But....regardless I do recommend this book to fill in other<br />journalistic gaps in our Country's History....it broadens one's view<br />of our Country.....cleans up some of the wrong assumptions<br />that have over the years been planted in our collective mind.
B000FA675C|3.0|This is one of the few books where I finished reading it, and said to myself, wow, the movie was a lot better. It's a quick and easy read, and full of all the historical inaccuracies that everybody complains about. I found the writing a little too simple for my taste, and Tom Hanks makes everything better anyway.
6304711905|5.0|After a visit to the real tombstone in Ar. this was a fun way to see the place in a different way.
B003EY7JH6|4.0|Excellent into to the Foundation Trilogy. This is one of two prequel books to the trilogy, and they provide very good information that makes the trilogy itself more enjoyable.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|Great movie.  My 3 year old grandson and the rest of us had a fun time with this movie.  I can see it over and over again.
B000SGRONM|5.0|The writer is witty and sarcastic in all the right places. His tongue and cheek look at Christmas is fabulous. I normally am not a fan of short stories but this is a must read. I actually found myself laughing out loud at some of his prose. My favorite is the newsletter written for family members and friends.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|Very little good humor in this one. Nothing like the first and second one. The funniest part of the movie is at the end, and lasts about 20 seconds.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|It was an excellent read & gave an insight to the hardship of life in Afghanistan. The only thing I didn't like was the sudden change of subject & characters without any indication so that it took a little while to understand who the subject was.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Why didn't I get this earlier !  So handy for the busy brain who can't do simple math at times!
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|It was good but the impression was they were tired with what they were doing and it seemed to reflect a more boring tone.
B00GNL96H8|5.0|This was a wonderfully made film. Of course the action was amazing but the, I don't know the right word, the look and feel of the movie was LOL again I'll say amazing. If your a fan of Martial Arts film or just like a wonderfully made film, get this.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|A great read<br /> I could not put it down.  John Grisham at  his best.  Hope we hear more about Jake
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love this its like candy crush but jewles make it intetesting flashy and shiney love playing it all the kids love this too
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|Not enough of Prendergast. Too much about Corrie. Boring at times. Particularly boring near the end, with the mine chase.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I loved almost  everything about this app until I had a computer issue and all apps without password codes erased. But, I thought I had a pass code for this app. It says I need previous code. Since I don't recall having one, I have no way to retrieve one. Where is a feature to retrieve lost passcodes for this app so all data will not erase in these circumstances?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I missed playing I am mobile now days and use kindle mostly.<br />I played on computers spend time on kindle now
B00BD99JMW|4.0|S*** happens ,people die. If you all want happy ending go and read Disney fantasy books. Reality is always a bitch.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Love this album and booklet. Love this band and iLove how it was available right away on my computer :)
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This is probably the most useful app I have. I have been using it for over a year on my kindle fire and it works great!
B004XWLN20|5.0|The casing was beautiful, the extras were phenomenal, and the DVD's were flawless. I love Smallville, and having them an hand has just multiplied this joy
B00GINENG0|5.0|Is it weird I like this game when am 13? I donot know how they made this sooooo fun! His first a baby then you have to take care of him till grandpa or something I would get this! 5 STARS!!! :D
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game, It makes me think, It pushes our thinking buttons to the point you want to start again.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|This movie is a family favorite. We all have parts of it memorized and refer to it often.  It is hands down the best Christmas movie EVER !!! Very funny with a lot of heart. We watch it every year without fail, wouldn't be Christmas without it. We all can relate to the characters in this movie, the crazy aunt, redneck cousin and the brother / sister dynamics. Just so familiar.
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked it but my daughter loves it.  I bought the movie for her.  She's going to be so surprised!
B008602KQI|5.0|Not as good as the books, but for a movie it's really good. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Catnis. looking forward to the next one.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|it is awesome and a fun way to pass time just wish it was a little cheaper so yea other than that it's great
B008JFUR10|5.0|One of the best movies release in the past 20 years, I've gotta say, I'm impressed. I went in with SERIOUSLY high expectations and was still surprised.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome. I love this game. I love trying to unlock new characters. It is beyond what I thought it would be.
B004YM6JK0|4.0|The later seasons have gotten kind of sloppy, but I do still enjoy it, and seven is one of the best. It definitely has the best villains by far.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|This movie is a classic. It is great to remind everyone that everyone has feelings, even little pigs like Babe.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I've never highlighted so much in one book as I have in this one... Nor have I cried so much while reading a book in a long while.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Extremely informative. My life changed after watching this, this is a movie everyone on Earth should see. There's some well researched facts that everyone should apply to their diets.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Absolutely excellent.  I very rarely like every song on an album, but this is one of those rare exceptions.  Every song is perfect.  I like how it's a positive album as well.  The only problem is that it isn't long enough!  I can't wait for the next one!
B001EBWIRW|5.0|It is entertaining and the music is fun while spoofing 1950's &#34;B&#34; movie plots. If a little diversion is what is needed and a quick trip to a simpler time would help, it is worth a try.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I enjoy the game, but at this point am frustrated as I have played the level so many times.....I don't think it is possible to complete it successfully so probably will switch to another game.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Reached is not a human;he's a clone of superman. Edge of the chair suspenseful. Child is no child either when it comes to plot, character development and technology.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|This is a great game, but I have one big complain from amazon and the programmers.  They are way behind on updates.  Androids are the 1st get upgrades and then Apple devices.  Current games have rollercoaster updates over a week now and this aps for amazon is at least 2 maybe 3 updates behind.  Last vehicle is the dune buggy.  This is one major reason I was tempted to buy an Ipad mini, if it wasn't for their current shortages of Ipad mini2 I would have purchased one and delayed on the new HDX.  The $50.00 off the new kindle lean me towards the new HDX.  They need to updates their aps much sooner as soon as androids gets theres.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Usually when I read in bed, I fall asleep pretty quickly.  This book kept me engaged and interested the whole time, I didn't want to put it down!
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|The music is incredible.  Love the way they harmonize.  Gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling when you listen to it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Phenomenal book, one of the best fictional holocaust stories ever told. Heck, probably one of the most poignant holocaust stories ever told period, fiction or not. Zusak has a beautiful way with words - the book isn't graphic or full of gore, but it paints a very clear and harrowing picture all the same. This book is not a beach-read; you will cry. The entire last forty pages you'll be in the fetal position practically. But it's so worth it. The Book Thief is a classic.
B00G922EA2|5.0|It was a good story and a fun game.  I wish it wouldn't have ended so abruptly though.  Would have been nice to have a proper ending and beet the bad guy.<br /><br />Loved it though and it is renewing my faith in G5 games.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I really wanted a clock that looked like the picture.  You know, the old fashioned round one with the bells on top but if that look is available I can't figure out how to get it and if it's not perhaps the icon should be updated to be more representative of the app.
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|I was pretty excited about this one because I love all the futuristic dystopian society movies.  This fell pretty short.  It's worth watching I guess and I do feel some ties to District 9 in the look and feel of it but where is the story in all this.  It's well enough acted and decent cinematography/effects but the writing is lousy.
B004132HZS|5.0|The Cumberbatch-Freeman pairing is perfect and the translation to the modern times virtually seamless.  It's a lot of fun finding the modern equivalents of Conan Doyle's elements (e.g., a \\"three nicotine patch\\" problem instead of a \\"three pipe\\" mystery).  Only two minor quibbles.<br /><br />First, the term \\"Season\\" is somewhat misleading.  The package contains three 90-minute shows plus the unaired, 60-minute pilot version of \\"A Study In Pink.\\"  (Two of the episodes have commentary versions.)  Three shows do not make much of a \\"season.\\"  Season Two is the same:  only three episodes.<br /><br />Second, in an effort to to expand \\"Pink\\" to 90 minutes it seems like they padded the ending with too much dialogue just to fill it out.  The ending moves far more slowly after the breakneck pace leading up the the denouement.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I got this to go on my Athlon X4 760k. I definitely recommend it over the stock cooler; I'm overclocked from 3.8Ghz to 4.5Ghz. While it's a bit of a pain to install (the manual is junk--watch a youtube video or find a guide online) my processor maxes out at 52C running Prime95 and idles at 36C. Very satisfied. I got mine with a rebate which they are still processing but it was pretty simple to submit. It's worth the money even without the rebate, though.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Hadn't read a John Grisham book in years.  This book lived up to the reviews.  Lawyers battling against lawyers in Mississippi makes for a very entertaining book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Can be hard to beat levels but that's the point. Few glitches when syncing with Facebook but otherwise awesome.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Really good and enlightening about North Korea.  Even though I had seen stories on N. Korea on such shows as &#34;60 Minutes etc. I ever knew it was as bad as it is and has been for over 60 years.  The people are literally starving prisoners, while the family of leaders do whatever they want.  I thought the stories about the N. Koreans who escaped in the past 10 years were extremely interesting.  How they adjust, or don't adjust to life elsewhere is intriguing.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I really like this game, particularly this version where you do not have to drag the cards, just touch and they go to the correct spot.  The only thing I would add, I would like to see a game number, so you could possibly replay some of the tougher layouts, or the ability to play and work your way through all the layouts in sequence.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The author knew how to write about kids (and adults) that came across as real human beings.  I think every upper grade student should read this book, as well as educators and parents.  It's a great story about a smart kid dealing with major physical handicaps in a new school environment, and how he looked at himself, his family and life in general.  I could hardly put the book down because I became so engrossed in the fictional  character's lives.  Made me cry and laugh.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Examines, in great detail, the times, and the men, who helped Lincoln preserve the Union.  This should be required reading for anyone who has any interest in the man or the time.<br />Our history is a great story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love using this app.  It's very intuitive.  The large numbers make it easy to read and I like the appearance of the calculator. The &quot;tape&quot; is very cool and useful besides.
1401938906|5.0|Love this book. The experiments work. I am a science person, so I was drawn to this book. It gives us experiments that are easy to do, and work to prove the power we have within us to change the direction of our lives. Puts Wayne Dyer, The Secret, Quantum Physics, etc., to the test. Loved this hands on opportunity. Easy to do! Just get it, you will be glad you did. No more excuses for not changing YOUR life. Just do it!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|This movie was okay - but no one in my family was overly impressed with it.  We  got bored with it after awhile.  There was a real lack of chemistry between Amy Adams and Henry Cavill so we didn't much care if there was a romance between Clark and Lois or not.  The battle between the Superman and his evil nemesis was the usual thing, a long drawn out fight that never seemed to end.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I LOVE this DVD. The music was awesome, his style and personality was/is a beautiful thing. This DVD is a must! It is an actual EXPERIENCE. Please do not miss it.
159184617X|2.0|The book is absolutely to read if you want to spend hours and hours reading that Jony Ive was the best in everything! From Elementary school to these days he is the best. It's so boring, there is nothing else!<br />these book is rubbish. It doesn't go deep in the life and thought. It's written to make money, just cause Ive today is one of the most famous person in the &#34;contemporary&#34; world, a super star.<br />I would say to the writer, face to face, that every architect, designer copies the work of someone else in a way or another, unless they are real geniuses like Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies, Le Corbusier, Starck!! and the italian designers of the past. Jony copied a lot, with a deep inspiration in German Braun company design. They call 'inspiration' but it's not.<br />I really appreciate the work of Ive but this book it's way too much far about reality.<br />Everyone can copy Ive's style, none can copy Starck's.<br />Ask to yourself why.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it love it love it so addictive highly reccomend for everyone I just love it very much. five stars for sure. keeps me happy even on bad days
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|As usual, Preston and Child, never fail to entertain! White Fire was a great read! Pendergast fans will not be disappointed. This book dwells on a newer character but there is enough Pendergast to please us, fans. I highly recommend reading this book.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Very entertaining and funny as well. I can hardly wait to read his next book. I only hope more of my favorite characters survive it!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is a beautiful look into an era where family was important and people cared about their neighbors and their community.  This should be a standard read for all students.  Sad that we have lost so much of the innocence of this era and the strength to persevere when times are tough.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Graphics, gameplay, all pleasantly surprising. Still getting used to it but it's tons of fun. One of the best games I have played so far for the Kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device is very good. But there are some limitation for users in germany. That's sorry, but perhaps it is in investition in the future.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There better be twenty more books. I would love to read more and more of this story. Such good writing. I have never been so into a book as I have been with this series. I can't lie, I cried, I laughed, I got high blood pressure, I got hot and bothered, I never thought in a million years I would be so into a book. Please write more, how you left off, from the Christian perspective! I bet that would be hot as hell.  Oh, and thank you for bringing my passion for reading back.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|awesome movie , great visuals must see and waiting for the sequel, solid acting and hope they get a more deep introduction to villains and heroes on the sequel
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Cute movie! Used the Amazon viewing app on our PS3, worked great with no interruptions. Very useful app, easy to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love how the game progresses in each level. I have become a modern houdini. l just love playing it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this! It is easy to use and convenient for watching shows in other rooms when there is nothing on cable.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book is so magical! I totally think kids who are looking for a book read this. But read the first one first! Can't wait to read the next one!!! Peace out!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|it ducks and as soon as you get it your life is gone.<br />you will be playing it for 5 hours strait and your brain will turn to mush! if that's fun for you then disregard this comment.
B00000J2SQ|4.0|In my opinion this record is good but not excellent. When &#34;Straight between the eyes&#34; was issued Ronnie James Dio was no longer in the band. He was replaced by another guy whose voice was not so fine and peculiar. To be honest, I actually prefer Rainbow with Dio to Rainbow's music accompanied with other vocals or vocalists.<br />I am still a keen fan of Dio and Black Sabbath. So I think this record is not so great as compared to &#34;Ritchie's Blackmore Rainbow&#34;, &#34;Rising&#34;, &#34;Long live rock and roll&#34; which came out in the 70s. It was the time when Dio was singing for the band. However, &#34;Straight between the eyes&#34; may be regarded as one of the best hard rock LPs in the 80s mainly due to the music content. As regards music the CD is almost perfect. It is hard to mention any poor tracks on it. I guess the best songs are: &#34;Death Alley driver&#34; (powerful intro), &#34;Stone cold&#34; (the greatest hit), &#34;Bring on the night (Dream chaser)&#34; (quite nice tune), &#34;Power&#34; (pure, classic hard rock song), &#34;Tearin' out my heart&#34; (pretty, sentimental song), &#34;MISS Mistreated&#34; (my favourite song on this CD) and &#34;Eyes of fire&#34; (the glorious and absorbing final song). The only two songs which do not seem to fit in here are: &#34;Tite squeeze&#34; and &#34;Rock fever&#34;. To sum up, if Ronnie James Dio was the vocalist of Rainbow in the 80s, I would award this record five stars. But it did not happen. Thus my rating of this CD is not the highest.
0307476073|4.0|This was an enjoyable memoir, always surprising. Cheryl Strayed went on a difficult journey and took me along. I look forward to the sequel.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|The best Star Trek Parody out there hilarious every time I watch this movie it never gets old.  The aliens are awesome..
B00F35BV64|2.0|J.J. Abrams is style over substance. We all know about his comical use of lens flares, but it's the story where he's fundamentally weak. No obvious affinity for any flavor of Star Trek, and his work is pretty to the detriment of story. And the poor decision to mask Cumberbatch's character's name -- just lame. And when they got to the magic blood potion, I almost turned it off right then. Did Bones get help from a witch with a cauldron? Incredibly lame.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the Star Wars fans. Abrams doesn't have the slightest understanding of science, and so his scripts are full of deus ex machina gimmicks. Gee -- let's just throw in transporting between planets because we don't want to spend time getting there (that time). Then why is the whole movie about a starship? Let's kill the lead and resurrect him with a magic blood potion -- is Kirk a vampire in the next movie? On and on, he just doesn't have any understanding or affinity for basic science, physics, or common sense. Throw in another lens flare, or 50! How about lens flares on lens flares on lens flares -- take it to the limit. Really creative.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that the cast is good to excellent. It's a shame they had to work with such poor writing.... I'm sure they all got some great footage for their resumes, at least.
B0060D123K|5.0|It's the Muppets!! Need we know more? Colorful, happy and appropriate for the whole family. Anyone familiar with the Muppets will enjoy the activity, color, music and the story is classic.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I think this is a good game if you have younger children.It may be hard also.I would rate 4 stars.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Not user friendly.  Can't figure out how to make the radar active.  Was hoping for a better app.  That's the truth.
0765365278|5.0|This is by far the best fantasy novel I have ever read. Sanderson proves himself as a top-level novelist and should be considered as such (assuming the rest of the books in this series are written at the same level).
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book. It is about two people that would never have met without one second of an accident. It is such an honest story. The characters were straight forward and being themselves. Now that I am finished with the book, I will miss them. I am a bit in mourning myself.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|This is a fun puzzle solving game. The theme is funny and the puzzles get progressively harder as you move through the levels.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|All I remember of this movie is that almost every scene was just a set up for an action sequence as if it were a video game. It lacked the humor, drama, ROMANCE between Lois and Clark, charm, and character development of the original series. Plus, they couldn't top the original John Williams score in this one.  This sounded like the Dark Knight theme.  The plot was rushed, so there wasn't any suspense or anticipation.  I fell asleep in the action.  Zod was forgettable.  I even had more fun watching a Quest for Peace.  I remember how bad that one was, but this one is completely forgettable.  I thought i was watching a Micheal Bay transformers movie. Superman Returns was a welcome entry to the series although far from perfect.
1451627297|2.0|The next person who steps into a rabbit hole and time travels to the &#34;Land of Ago,&#34; please look up Stephen King and replace the books he says he read about JFK's assassination with some that might have disabused him of the idea that Oswald was the lone gunman. (Jim Marrs' Crossfile, for one)<br /><br />So that was my first problem with this book. That such a widely read author would perpetuate the nonsense of the Warren Commission report.<br /><br />But if I accept that King needed a single gunman for his plot line (after all, how could his hero stop a multi-layered conspiracy?), I have concerns with how he handled it.<br /><br />Long before the confrontation with Oswald, Jake decided that after saving Kennedy he would stay in the land of Ago with his new love, Sadie. Her subsequent disfiguring wound makes him want to take her back to 2011 for the benefits of modern surgery. This reason seems thin after Sadie had made such a wonderful life-affirming adjustment to her scars.<br /><br />One of Jake's first efforts to &#34;fix&#34; reality concerned a man who killed his family. Jake botches the job but promises he'll do better next time (because events can &#34;reset&#34; in Stephen King's idea of time travel). And indeed, Jake, on the second try, does it right and saves the family. Mainly by not waiting to the last minute.<br /><br />One would hope this would have been a lesson to Jake re Oswald -- don't wait too long to stop him.<br /><br />Alas, because Jake made big bets on races/sports events (since he knows the outcomes of contests and he wants all that cash to live on), he gets badly beaten by suspicious bookies, suffers amnesia and by the time he remembers everything it's November 20, 1963.<br /><br />He has also told Sadie about his mission and she goes with him to the Book Depositary. And is shot and killed by Oswald. But Kennedy is saved.<br /><br />Here's my gripe: Why can't Jake let reality reset and go back and DO IT RIGHT: kill Oswald and save Kennedy without getting Sadie killed?<br /><br />King's reason for not giving Jake a redo with Oswald seems to be that Jake doesn't like the 2011 world that ensued if Kennedy survived. If so, King should have taken  another 100 pages to establish this instead of dashing it off in a few paragraphs.<br /><br />Jake does go back one last time, to reset reality to 1958 so Sadie can be alive again. Then he stays the hell out of her life (!) and scurries back to 2011. Of course, in 1963 Kennedy dies.<br /><br />To make the &#34;love story&#34; of Jake and Sadie somehow satisfying, King has Jake in 2011 watch (with newspapers) the progress of Sadie's life advance through the years until hers catches up to Jake's. They meet. She's then twice as old as Jake, who's a complete stranger to her, but, what the heck, they can still dance.<br /><br />King is not a bad writer; the narrative flows and he captures the flavor of the earlier era in his descriptions of everyday life: the effect of having no cell phones, the mores that affect behavior.<br /><br />But the plot in execution is illogical and silly. This is the first book of Stephen King I've read. It's also the last.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Versatile and easy to use.This app has something for everyone! I had trouble falling asleep, but not anymore! I highly recommend this!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book -it captured me and I love a good &#34;our govt gets hoodwinked&#34; kind of storyline. Great read!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham books and thoroughly enjoyed reading this one, I have been reading a lot of books by Authors I do not know and now realize how much I missed reading books from my favorite Author.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|While somewhat slow at times, it kept my attention throughout.  The tasteful treatment of the blood issues was greatly appreciated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it and hate it all in one! You can not go wrong with this game. Play on crushers play on!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|So compelling, held my interest to the very last page.  I couldn't stop thinking about it for many days because of all the twists and turns in this story
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is a well-written and interesting story that moved along. I enjoyed it so much that I am moving on to the next book.
B0017P520U|4.0|I just wish they'd release this in 3D.  The movie was so well don in 3D that they'd make money on more sales with a 3D version.  I know I'm not the only one who'd buy it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Wife bought and rad for book club, I read it out of curiosity..  Definitely a 'chick' book but a good thought provoking story as long as you don't think too hard.  Writers style takes some getting used too, but overall enjoyable even if you decide you don't like ANY of the characters by the end if the story. Couldn't put it down in the end even though parts were predictable.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic! A must-read for all coaches and teachers to help a great better next generation of &#34;talents&#34;.
0920668372|5.0|i READ THIS TO MY GRANDSON AND HE LOVES IT everytime -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO GETfor any one with kids or grand kids
B0083Z614S|5.0|I reread my favorite childhood story with love and enjoyed every moment!  How new it all felt at 60 rather than at 8!!<br />The filmis good but the book is better
B00632HWOG|1.0|HATE the new version!! hate the way emails are ganged up and randomly show up in the string. I want my old style back!
B003TOH8AE|5.0|A great movie! It is so fun. And I like the hit girl. She is cute except a little bit violent. It is super amusing when kick ass says:&#34; No! IT IS MY BUSINESS!&#34;
1936608898|5.0|Changed my life, diet and overall level of living.<br /><br />I hate the fact that more people don't care about where their food comes from, or how it's 'made'. Set on 'industrial farming' and 100% processed foods will just kill our country from the ground up. Literally.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook sucks.  Plain and simple.  It's just a data mining operation.  You'd think that a company with as much clout and revenue as Facebook could make a real &#34;app&#34;.  This is basically a link to their mobile site.  Seriously, if you're gonna steal my data, serve me ads, and then sell my info to other companies... the least you could do is spit on your hand and lube me up first... make the app sexy.  This is BS.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Still like the second book much better.  Third book was probably my least favorite!  Excited to see how the third book is depicted in the movies.
B004YF6MHW|5.0|By far the best standard camera replacement for Android.  Even Lifehacker recommends this app to replace your standard camera.  It has many more filters and effects than the &#34;redheaded stepchild&#34; of camera apps (Instagram), it has smoother processing, and straight up kills all it's competition.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|A really fun flick. No Oscar here, but good, raunchy fun. Jennifer Aniston is always number one in my book!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading it each evening before bed. However the ending was a real let down. It was like Grisham had written the number of pages he was contracted for so he stopped. I wanted some loose ends tied up!!
0307743721|4.0|Unfortunately, most of these stories were already published in the New Yorker, but it was still fun to re-read them.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|The game is great.  Graphics are top notch.  I couldn't be happier.  Better than the first one but the game play is almost identical
B00GINENG0|3.0|This game was uploaded for my granddaughter. She is two and she enjoys it up to a point. I don't like that she is able to click on ads while she plays. I have to keep a constant eye on her while she plays, so that she doesn't order something by mistake.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Great gift, everyone want to try and everyone would make it to different levels and keep trying, loved by kids and adults .
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a very relaxing and fun game to play. It can be challenging at times but not too challenging. I recommend it for those who enjoy the game mindsweeper.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book on how modern men fight wars on our behalf against countries that are 500 years behind us in mentality But they have the resources THAT WE NEED.
B003AJKPL2|5.0|Feels very nice in the hand, not slippery. Dishwasher safe. Making something like a cherry cobbler has turned into a pleasant experience rather than tedious and annoying :)). Really happy with this purchase.
B00CLD671A|5.0|Loved it.  Maggie Smith is my favorite when she is cynical, but she is widening her persona to surprise viewers at many turns.
1452101248|5.0|The photos are gorgeous, the recipes are well-written, and the layout of the entire book is simple and elegant.<br /><br />This was a gift to two people who love to cook. And they loved this book. I know, because they called me several days after they got the book to rave about the first recipe they tried.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well written with great characters.  Story keeps you engaged and I was disappointed when I finished it; wanting to read more.
B005HSL626|5.0|For me this app was a amazing. It has great graphics and is just plain fun. I seriously recommend this app to anyone interested.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great read!  The book kept my attention all the way to the end.  Grisham remains a great story teller.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is a great story filled with interesting characters and fascinating info about the dark side of art dealing and forgery. The underworld denizens are colorfully drawn and are a there to advance the storyline. Don't be put off by the length of the novel. Once you start reading you will not want it to end.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I've had the device for about a week now, and thus far I am not very impressed. It is still sorely lacking in application support, and my experience with what I've been able to try has been unreliable.<br /><br />Watching an HD video on Youtube/Netflix with a lot of movement/action? Be ready for jerky video.<br /><br />The one thing that has actually been reliable has been google music. But even that is crippled by the lack of local media support. Want to play a podcast that you've downloaded to your Android phone? Too bad.<br /><br />There is enormous potential here, but this is still a mostly-useless device. Sadly, Google has thwarted those who would like to root the device to unlock some of that potential by patching the hole that enables root access in an OTA update that is installed when you setup the Chromecast.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like to waste time playing Flow Free. It allows me to have a break from school work and it also makes you think.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A simple, yet powerful read.  I've been reading lots of personal development lately, so comparing this to the impact other books have had on me makes it good, but not great.  The anecdotal, storylike read makes it palletable without seeming like a lecture, kind of like Richest Man in Babylon.  The length isn't brutally long, but long enough to be immersive.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Uma Thurman for President ❤❤❤...<br /><br />Kill Bill 1 and 2 are addictive... Each time I watch them there is something new that stands out from the last time I watched it. They are over the top, extremely well done, often comical yet serious with enough action packed goodies for the most jaded person to get excited about... Love you QT❤❤❤
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Filthy and Funky..No!<br /><br />#It was good movie...but it was unpleasant.The scenes and makeup and action were superb..but the movie was filthy overall.REALLY.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I have used this app before, and it works very well, very reliably, and is quite straightforward to install and use.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Classic Trek never looked better! Back in the Standard Def Days, you couldn't tell who the stunt double was, but in High Def it's clear it's NOT the star!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Totally engrossing storyline, lots of action, and the ending is surprising.  This book was hard to put down, so don't be surprised if you lose some sleep. Enjoy!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Jimmy Stewart never disappointed....of course, Harvey's performance was stellar......choosing to be very smart or very pleasant., choose pleasant. a guaranteed smile.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Wow was not expecting that ending but thoroughly enjoyed this series. So sad to see it end and just loved Aiden and really felt for Seth and his feelings for Alex. Loved it all. Hats off to the author for an entertaining book.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|IS THERE A QUESTION WHY THIS IS THE SINGLE-GREATEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  CHEVY CHASE.  RANDY QUAID. DONE. JUST WATCH IT
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Very good book, as all P. Cornwell's books are. Very exciting story line. I have read almost all of her books she is great writer.
B00DYVU9K8|5.0|Sofia Coppola is pointless in the way Thomas Hardy is pointless. If you've seen some of her other movies like Lost in Translation or Marie Antoinette you know that a progressively disquiet desperation is a central theme of hers, especially the desperation of the rich and successful. The Bling Ring shares less in common with Lost in Translation's dreaminess than with Marie Antoinette's attempt to anesthetize herself from reality with decadent living. That means you get the parties, the crime, the drugs, everything the movie's characters refer to as &#34;the lifestyle.&#34; All this, especially the thievery, serves to create a driving tension that was purposefully eschewed in Coppola's previous movie Somewhere. The result is a more immediately entertaining movie.<br /><br />Coppola is obsessed with our obsession with celebrity. She shows you what wealth can do for a person, and then she shows you what wealth can do  𝐭𝐨 a person.<br /><br />Entertaining and ultimately haunting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had trouble reading another book after reading this. Excellent characters, writing and story. It went beyond all expectations. Highly recommend.
B00FJ7YDV6|3.0|Excellent but took up way too much space.  My grandson is a kindle junkie just like me but because of the size here I had to uninstall after he went home.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Really enjoy playing this match game. Like the ability to roll the cube over to see all 6 sides. A more  intelligent person probably can beat me time-wise, but I'd give them a run for their money.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Good terror althroughout.<br />I enjoyed the period clothing and music - late 60s.  The haunting is very scary.  Good casting.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I love Artic Monkeys and I was very excited about this album! It did not let me down, I'm in love with all their tracks.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Dont miss this book. Worth every second I spent reading it. Both times.  Makes me wonder how my dogs book would read.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|Loved the movie, loved the music. I kind of wished some of the removed songs would have made it to the film.
B00D1X0576|1.0|I downloaded this app for my tablet and It did not perform well at all.  It took an exceptional long time to load when the app was initiated and it then operated inconsistantly and sporadically.  It is possible that it required too much memory during operation as it reminded me of usage of certain websites that bog down.  To be fair, I understand that many apps that are intended for smartphones don't work very well on tablets.  But most apps that I have obtained and us on my tablet work satisfactory with a few exceptional.  Apps need to list on whether they are for smartphones and/or tablets.
B00GPE9HEA|5.0|Britney Spears takes her music to the next level with Britney Jean.  While it doesn't contain as many dance and carefree songs like her previous album Femme Fatale, Britney Jean takes things to a deeper level and contains songs dealing with heartbreak, loneliness, isolation, and falling in love.  Couldn't recommend this album more! Solid A.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it<br />#1 it is fast, the streams typically have no lag.  On my Nexus7(2013) often youtube is so slow to the point I cant watch it.  On the Chromecast is goes just as fast as watching it on a computer.  No lag and loading<br />#2 It is easy.  Just simply click the chromecast button at the top of the desired app(that supports chromecast) and it shows up on your tv.<br />#3 It is extremely portable.  You can take this anywhere and it takes up no room.<br /><br />Its a great service that continues to add great support.  HBO GO was recently added and works great<br /><br />I now rent movies on Google Play as opposed to amazon, dvr, etc..  Why? Because I always have my tablet or phone with me, so if I want to finish watching it on the go I can.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|The UI is clean and easy to use. The game runs well, and represents a session with the real game well. It doesn't do anything super special, but it meets every reasonable expectation you could have for a digital version of Carcassonne.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Great read if you are into international thriller. Allon is a great spy. Along the line of Reacher. Books should be made into movies or good TV series.
B008602KQI|4.0|Love this movie, of course like all adaptations the movie is never as good as the book, but love the casting choices and the movie was very good overall.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast is one of the beat quirky detective series. Preston and Childs keep you reading with these thrillers. Highly recommended for anyone liking quirky detectives. This is another book that should be made into a movie or TV series.
B002APU580|5.0|Probably my favorite movie of all time, and when it went on sale for a very great price i had to get my own copy.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I don't watch prime time television and stumbled across this browsing through Amazon Prime selections. Excellent show that keeps my interest. Glad I don't have to watch commercials either!!!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Love this feel good movie, it is my go to on a lazy day especially during the holidays, and cold weather.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Just finished watching Season 2 final episode last night 12/4/13. Season 2 seem to drag out a little more than Season 1, but it still kept me coming back. Love the Amazon Prime Video feature that allows me to watch shows without having to deal with commercials. Great benefit of being a Prime Member.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Horrifingly Addictive.  Try to destroy the world with disese, plague, even zombies if you unlock the new packs. It starts a simple game them you get hooked and soon you will curse humanity as they try to stop your baby plague.
B00DUE8IXY|4.0|It's quite good, but I think she has room to grow in her songs.  Her voice and talent are amazing for her youth however.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife with Fixed 1095 High Carbon Steel is an AMAZING AMAZING value.<br />For a 6.4 inch blade .25 thick full tang a true full tang this is the DEAL of the Knife World. As of December 2013 $39.00<br />on Amazon this is GREAT. EXCELLENT KNIFE - Sheath is fair - it's big. Worth getting a nice custom leather sheath.<br />This knife seems to be a great Farm Carry tool. It's TOUGH as nails - great handle - Sharp and fine looking.  For the price you invest it's not going to bother you to pound the heck out of it - what are knives for. You may want to get a 2nd as a collectors piece cause in my thought this is a $50.00 knife in 4 or 5 years if not sooner. For the price I would<br />take this over the Becker BK2 with .25 thick blade. The BK2 is a 5&#34; blade. I like the 6 inch blade - it's about a 6&#34; inch cutting<br />edge - I only count blade length from tip to where the blade starts - meaning the actual cutting edge not the entire size of the blade (why cound the finger choil area as part of the blade if it does not cut?)  For Wood Batoning I prefer at least a 7&#34; to 9&#34; blade. Becker BK9, Ontario RTAK2, Ontario SP8 .26 thick on the SP8. BK9 and RTAK2 are both 3/16th's thick. I believe the RTAK2 is a bit longer than BK9 but the blade profile on the BK9 is better for busting through wood. Although the BK9 is not .25 thick it will not get &#34;stuck&#34; in wood like a full flat grind blade will. Not enough &#34;real estate&#34; moving through the wood. Sort of like a very think Machete would not be able to Baton through 8&#34; oak it will get stuck. Not enough mass moving through. You won't have this with the Schrade - but the BK9 being thinner has more Length so to me it's more my style of a knife. Any knife can baton through 3&#34; diameter wood you don't need a .25 inch thick blade for small logs so I don't know why these short blades are so thick. It's nice since they will take abuse. I just with this Schrade was 7.5 inches that 1 inch makes a HUGE difference when trying to Baton wood.<br />Back to the Schrade.  It's too large for an EDC &#34;every day carry&#34; It dwarfs the Cold Steel SRK in mass although only 1/2 if that longer than SRK in total length. It would make a GREAT back pack blade. GREAT GREAT for wood Batoning. If you are not into 7 plus inch knives GET THIS ONE. It can do just about anything any knife can do and for the price this is a real nice gesture by Schrade. The Becker BK7 will be better for cutting food and for finer wood work cause the BK7 is thinner it's 3/16th of an inch - this Schrade is .25 inch thick VERY SOLID. I have a feeling this one will become a classic IF they end up discontinuing it soon. It is worth $50.00 in my book. Don't knock yourselves out looking for a knife this one is it. KABAR, Ontario, Ranger by Ontario are to me the best out there for the price and as good quality as a Busse or Essee - those are higher end designer blades for people who have more money to burn - at the end of the day this knife will do EVERYTHING any of the others can. Thanks Schrade - sad you are not made in the USA any more. So after buying this folks get a KABAR BK9 for your big carry or the Ontario SP9 or RTAK2 or Ranger 7 or Ranger 9 ALL MADE IN USA (Specific Models of these companies are still made in USA other models are made in Taiwan) Peace friends!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Zealot is well-written and extremely accessible, almost a page-turner.  Aslan's analysis of the schism between Paul and the Jerusalem-based apostles is stark and irresistible.  You'll never read Luke the same way again.  Aslan's description of how Paul ran away with the New Testament is jaw-dropping.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was so interesting!  I was fascinated by the story and thought about it for months after reading it.  This is not my typical style to read, but was so glad I did.  I recommend it to everyone!

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The promise of Chromecast was good but the device never worked for me. It couldn't connect to two different wireless routers I tried. Even enabling UPnP/disabling AP isolation as suggested in the help didn't work. Think the quality control/testing could have been better.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|A fun and entertaining game. I enjoy this type of game and this one has been engaging and easy to get started.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This movie made me laugh, cry and ponder life. It also makes me wonder what goes through the minds of someone faced their mortality due to a horrible illness and what it means for the ones left behind. Benedict Cumberbatch did a magnificent job of displaying the feelings of someone who is at the end of his life - a rounded portrayal, 'warts and all.' He is a treasure and a pleasure to watch, even when dealing with such a difficult subject.
0670880728|3.0|I got to say, there arent many times when I like the movie better then the book, but this was one. I was dissapointed at Bridget, in the movie I could relate to her, but the book character has too much baggage and its one of the most depressing people you´ll ever meet. Still, it has good momments and you learn to like her, but not Love her.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is where it all started for me: Sherlock. My &#34;Ben-Addiction&#34; began after watching series 1 of &#34;Sherlock&#34; and I was hooked. Series 2 was just as wonderful, including the cliffhanger. (Which, by the way, I can't wait to see how it's resolved in series 3 in January.) Benedict Cumberbatch is a wonderful actor, as is Martin Freeman. I was a bit leery about a new Sherlock Holmes series and even more so when I found out it was going to be set in the modern era. But Cumberbatch and Freeman made me forget all about my doubts with the fun, updated, wonderful take on the crime-solving duo. Hope to see many more years of this series.
055358894X|4.0|The plot idea I liked a lot, but it starts a bit slow, I read that people were not pleased with the way it switches the times when you change chapters, but there is always a reason for it, and if you dont read it, you wont understand 100% the meaning of the characters situation. I did like it in the end a lot, it was fun, I loved the characters, and it was like going on an adventure with a really cool guy (Locke) and his pals. I do recommend it, but FYI the second half is much better.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I had to uninstall this because it caused problems with other software on my computer.  Other programs wouldn't work right and when I uninstalled it, they began working correctly again.  So although it worked, I can't use it on my computer.
0439023513|5.0|This is the BEST book of the series, it made me laugh, it make me cried, it made me swear, I even gasped near the end, Suzanne Collins has outdone herself, you can really see how much she thought it over, to not make something predictable and boring, but she accomplished a well out of the box ending. If you liked the first two, this one will blow your mind. Enjoy!
B00FVZJUS2|5.0|Wonderful family movie. Both young and old cannot get enough of this movie. Great characters. I am often skeptical of sequels, but this one was at least as good as the first one, if not better.
0439023491|5.0|This is a cruel book, you feel Katniss agony because you know what happens next, and you do suffer, but this time, the characters know what they are up against, and they are not sad, but angry, I liked  it better this way, they will defend themselfs, Peeta, I believe is one of the best parts of the book, he is more cleaver and chivalrous than ever. The end will blow your mind! Enjoy!
B00APJLEGA|4.0|Nice off the beat and path kids movie with plenty for adults to enjoy as well. My daughters were a bit scared initially, but really grew to love this movie. For once Adam Sandler was not completely annoying.

B00DQZT494|1.0|Not what I expected. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't fold back on its self when holding the Kindle in my hands. Quality is iffy, definitely not worth the price paid. Will be returning it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The love of life and family is evident in the heart of this young German girl. Her intense desire to read and share those words with others were soothing in times of stress and the horrors of war. Very hard to put this book down.

B00C1BHQXK|4.0|I've been feeling stuck lately and this book came along at just the right time.  While there is nothing new or earth shattering in this book, the material is presented in a way that's easy to digest and put into practice.<br /><br />The points that resonated the most with me are:<br /><br />* Focus on your ONE big thing.  All your activities should be geared towards this one thing.  All else is superfluous.<br /><br />* Multi-tasking is counterproductive.  At least, my gut feeling has been vindicated.  Personally, I get much more done if I can give one task my undivided attention.  Many people will find fault with this premise as they drive, text and look at their smart phones.  All the while, claiming they are being very productive.  Oh sure, as they blast through a red light without even noticing.<br /><br />* Blocking time to work on your key (ONE thing) idea.  If you don't make time to go after your dreams, they will never come true.  Maybe you don't have the four hours per day as recommended by Gary, but you do need to schedule time.<br /><br />There were a few things that I didn't like about this book.  It seemed a bit repetitive and oftentimes wordy.  The stories Gary tells to illustrate his key concepts were good, but he could have made his point even more effectively if he had tightened up his writing and made it more concise.<br />I approach books like this with the attitude if I glean one or two new ideas to put into practice, then the book was worth reading.  This book is such a book.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Finally on the Amazon store! I've waited for this game to long. ITS THE REAL THING OTHER THEN THOSE OTHER FAKE APPS OUT THERE!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This saved us on our last day-long road trip! We bought two, and we're able to keep two iPhones and two iPads plugged in the full trip. I would recommend purchasing a 6-foot lightning cable for your back-seaters, so they can keep them charging while they use them.<br /><br />As other reviews stated, one (Apple) port can charge the iPad and iPhone, the other just the iPhone (and other devices). The Apple port charged both our iPads and iPad Minis.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|Nice book really worth your time to read, have always been a Fan of Sherlock Holmes and this book has lived up to the expectations
0743270754|5.0|Amazing - 2 thousand reviews and counting for what amounts to a college-level history book.  But what a book!<br /><br />Goodwin sucks you in to the political landscape and monumental underlying forces that shaped that landscape, delving into the experiences that formed the key individuals of that time  – Lincoln, Stanton, Seward, Chase, Bates.  Her writing style and incredible depth of content do not make an easy read, so do not expect to tear through this one if you want to do it justice.  There is so much information to absorb before you can understand the forces Lincoln experienced in 1860.  The politics including the Whigs and Democrats and newly-formed Republicans, and the different fractions of each party; the political and personal motivations of Lincoln’s rivals; and the underlying issue of Slavery, which droving the issue of Union, which every politician from Ben Franklin on KNEW would ultimately tear this nation apart.<br /><br />Goodwin marvelously engages you into Lincoln’s personal demons, the manipulations of his cabinet, the outright insubordination of his generals, the vitriol and hatred from the newspapers, the public backlash and constant pressure to maintain public sentiment in the Union cause; and most crushing, the knowledge that ten thousand men were dying each month.  You almost have to laugh when Lincoln reflects “If I had known what the first 6 months of the Presidency would be like, I never would have run for office….”<br /><br />A beautiful book, a riveting book, an essential book on THE pivotal moment in our nation’s (and world’s) history; and on man who conscience has become the ideal to which the nation continues to strive to this day.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie given it was funny, played with stereotypes and did a good job satirizing a lot of horror movies
0375704027|5.0|I was introduced to Haruki Murakami when I read ‘ What do I talk about when I talk about running’. The honesty of expression touched me, and I wrapped up Dance, Dance,Dance, A Wild Sheep Chase, and now, Norwegian Wood.<br /><br />The magnet of Murakami’s writing is clear, simple and direct human emotions. He is so naked in his depiction of the human mind, that I have always got mildly depressed at such an honest depiction. I read somewhere that he doesn’t devise a plot for the stiry in advance, the story writes itself, or so he insists. I couldn’t agree more. Reading Norwegian wood is akin to a psychedelic trip of life, what with the characters, circumstances and the plot, all showing signs of gray.<br /><br />The story is about the protagonist reminiscing about his college life, and the romance therein, with two girls, Midori and Naoko. The story is brooding from the word go, for Murakami doesn’t sketch his heroes  as larger than life. They are men next door, people with basic requirements from life and themselves, going through the motions. Our protagonist is no different.<br /><br />The purists may frown at the prospect of the hero being in love with two women at almost the same time, but this writing is honest, this is blunt, and cutting. You cannot but not empathise with Toru Watanabe for his means and views on life are more instantaneous than well thought of, and this is what gives the character a lot of flesh and blood.<br /><br />Murakami has a way with words, and the eyes well up at the sight of various interactions between the characters. Sample this:<br /><br />“Waiting for the perfect love?”<br /><br />“No, even I know better than that. I’m looking for selfishness. Perfect selfishness. Like, say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortcake. And you stop everything you’re doing and run out and buy it for me. And you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and hold this strawberry shortcake out to me. And I say I don’t want it anymore and throw it out the window. That’s what I’m looking for.”<br /><br />Murakami will enter your heart, slowly draw the emotions out, emotions you really never knew existed, and he will make you cry, probably. Such is the command of the master on  words concerning matters of the heart. Here again, another favorite:<br /><br />“Tell me something, Toru,” She said. “Do you love me?”<br /><br />“You know I do.”<br /><br />“Will you do me two favors?”<br /><br />“You can have up to three wishes, Madame.”<br /><br />Naoko smiled and shook her head.” No, two will do. One is for you to realize how grateful I am that you came to see me here. I hope you’ll understand how happy you’ve made me. I know it’s going to save me if anything will. I may not show it, but it’s true.”<br /><br />“I’ll come to see you again.” I said. “And what is the other wish?”<br /><br />“I want you always remember me. Will you remember that I existed, and that I stood next to you here like this?”<br /><br />“Always,” I said. “I’ll always remember.”<br /><br />It’s a brooding treatise on human emotions at play, refusing to get blinded by the societal mores, emotions running wild on only the adventure of the moment and the occasional result of loss of innocence.  Please read it for everything to do with an imperfect love. Then read it again. They don’t write things like these anymore. Perfect ten.<br /><br />My special thanks to @bookwiser on Twitter for introducing me to Murakami. I remain grateful.

B000000YG4|5.0|Sonny Rollins - Saxophone Colossus  180g Vinyl<br />  Saxophone Colossus is one of the jazz desert island picks for me .....no question about it.....<br /><br />  The album was recorded one afternoon in Rudy Van Gelder's living room/studio with the assistance of  drummer Max Roach, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and bassist Doug Watkins.  This quartet manage to cover quire a wide spectrum of sound on this album and do so with tons of zest and energy.  There is also quite a lot of tempo and tone changes throughout this album and never really stands too still for too long!<br /><br />&#34; Moritat&#34; is Rollins' spin on Jack The Knife from which he takes us on quite a journey....and no Bobby Darin!<br /><br />  The Prestige 180g vinyl sounds excellent and offers a lovely warm vibe throughout the album.  This album is a treasure of the jazz genre and should be in every music lovers collection.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Crashed once and didn't save the progress once. Other than that I really like the game and you will too
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Challenging!  Rewards persistence, patience, memory, and logic. Neat intuitive logic game, increasingly difficult. Just when I thought I'd give up, I  figured out the high level.  Not bad for an old dude.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I only played the easiest level twice on two different puzzles so far but have enjoyed it very much. They have about four different levels of difficulty, I haven't tried yet but it looks challenging. I play on a kindle and my husband pointed out if you have bigger fingers it's difficult to press the correct puzzle piece. But besides that we really enjoy it. Was so easy to install as well.  :)
B00003CX5P|1.0|Bought as a gift for someone and was completely disappointed by the packaging - it looks as if someone bit the cover.  Expected a better condition.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Without reading the books there's no way to know that he's been aware all the time she's been yanking his chain. Just like Castle said, several different times in several different ways, &#34;she doesn't know her own feelings.&#34;<br />I hope the rest give as much insight into the characters of the show, as well as, the shows are.
B008JFUPPI|5.0|This movie was extremely funny.  I had to watch it several times back to back because I couldn't believe how funny it was.  I had put off going to the Movies to seem thinking that it might not be worth the money, but when I rented it on Amazon and saw how much I enjoyed it.  I had to go on and purchase it.  Then I watch it over and over again and when my kids came home I watched it with them again. so we all laughed.<br /><br />Great Movie!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It works only with youtube or netflix. If you want to play some videos from your computer, you must buy a media player, not this.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is an amazing looking prop for any Walking Dead fan.  Comes to you well boxed and is a must have  for your collection.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Brilliant. I read this 35 years ago in college, and have now recently read it for the second time. It reminds me again of why is he's one of the foremost science fiction writers of the 20 and 21st century.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Awesome. Came well packaged and very quickly. Great looking product.  A must have for any Walking Dead fans. Can't wait to see what season 4 brings.
B00ERH15WY|4.0|I first saw Bad Religion live in 1983. I lived in the Arizona desert at the time, so hearing tracks from &#34;How Could Hell Be Any Worse&#34; felt very fitting. I first saw Bob Dylan a couple years later in the same Arizona desert (different venue obviously) I never thought I would be typing these words, but I really like the Christmas albums by both Dylan and Bad Religion.<br /><br />Just as Dylan's Christmas album was both a surprise and, in retrospect, not terribly surprising, this EP is both a surprise and, considering their history, not terribly surprising. It's perplexing on its face, but BR have played Christmas songs live in concert for quite some time. I won't go into what I know or think about the theologies of each member other than to say they have never struck me as a &#34;black and white, all or nothing, believe what we believe&#34; group. More nuanced.<br /><br />So, about this EP specifically. I really enjoyed it and have it in heavy rotation with other Christmas and holiday-related songs on my MP3 player. Each song is tight, and some of the harmonies are wonderful. A couple things I really like about BR over the years is their workman-like precision in putting songs together and their sonic harmonies. On Christmas Songs, they turn their musical attention to traditional songs for this part of the year, and add American Jesus, a lesser-known song. The mix on the album is quite well-done, the guitar and the rhythm section are just right in the mix.<br /><br />It's been noted before that the album's flow from song to song is interrupted a couple times. I agree, and take one star off for two factors: that flow (or lack at points thereof), and for not getting at least a couple more songs. BR has played more Christmas songs live than they present here, and this CD clocks in way too short for me. I love what they've done with The Little Drummer Boy (again, the rhythm section is amazing, the bass line kicks it on this one) and O Come All Ye Faithful (I got chills). It's a really good EP, and I'd recommend you buy it if you like the genres (punk and/or Christmas). I made a playlist to re-sequence the songs in the order I would have put them in, but there's no getting over that once it gets started, it's kind of a shame to have it all end so quickly. Still a great EP.chills). It's a really good EP, and I'd recommend you buy it if you like the genres (punk and/or Christmas).

B0027V6AL8|1.0|Man is this movie bad!  I read the running man with my English class and thought it would be cool to have the class watch the movie. This movie is very loosely based on the book and I do mean loosely.  The students were like where is his wife and little girl? Richardson a former cop?  If you are a fan of the book skip this movie. I read in Arnold's autobiography that he thought the film was bad I just did not realize that the story was completely butchered in the film.
B00G70WLJA|1.0|My husband bought the DVD because we missed seeing in the theater. We missed nothing! There aren't enough words to describe how bad this movie turned out to be. Hugh Jackman must have needed some fast cash for him to have been connected to this horror. The Japanese must be furious how this piece of trash portrayed living there. It's one of the safest countries I have ever been in and the idea of the Yakuzi (Japanese mafia) shooting it out in the streets like the drug cartels just doesn't happen! Don't get me wrong, bad things happen, but not in public. If you know anything about the Japanese culture, the whole premise is just stupid. No way would someone who's life you saved would pull a stunt like that, talk about losing face! Save your money or flush it down the toilet, same result. There is not one redeeming scene in this movie for Wolverine fans.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|picture does not do it justice.. i collect alot of DC and Marvel figures and these ones are a great addition. the stand that it comes with definitely adds to the quality of this deal. would highly recommend the Kotobukiya figures. slowly buying the whole line of these ones;) lol
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Wonderful concert video.  The spirit of the band and the audience is amazing.  The music,itself, is incredible.  Prog rock at it's best.  Peppered with some wonderful guest artists, this one is a stunner.<br />Great stuff!

B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this album!!!  My whole family does!  We have listened to it almost every day since purchasing it and sometimes a few times a day.  Amazing, uplifting, sweet, wonderful music!  It brings the Spirit of Christmas!  Thank you Piano Guys!!!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Typical Grisham. It's hard to put down once you get engaged in the story.. There is a nice twist at the end.
0061730327|5.0|One of the greatest stories I have ever read.  I could not put this book down.  Literally.  I read this book cover to cover in one afternoon.  I have recommedned this book to many of my high school students to show them that all it takes is dedication and a desire to learn in order to achieve greatness.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|A pretty unique movie...love Matthew...some unusual twists which were good...different, how refreshing!  Had overnighting relatives watch while I was fixing dinner.  They liked it as well.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Easily one of the best lego sets I have ever purchased.  I already bought two and had to buy a third one.  The BTTF Delorean time machine set allows you to build all three versions of the DeLorean.  You can build the 1985 DeLorean, the future hovering DeLorean (with Mr Fusion).  and the 1885 version ready to take the rail road tracks.  This is a fairly invovled construction.  It has a ton of parts.  It took me and ym girlfriend about 30 minutes to put it all together. The figures do not sit in the car very well, but some simple modifications can solve that.<br />I especially enjoyed the clear blocks used so it can &#34;hover&#34; while sitting on my display shelf.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|For people who devoured the first and second book, you definitely need to read this one and complete the series. However, be warned that it's not going to be rainbows and butterflies.<br /><br />(No detailed spoilers, just comments on tone):<br />I really thought that Mockingjay was pretty depressing. Of course it was still powerful in its messages, and you can be assured that Suzanne Collins doesn't just leave the story incomplete. However, Katniss was in a state of post traumatic stress, and was depressed,  as were a lot of the people around her. Although the PTS is understandable after everything her character has endured (plus it's more realistic), I felt pretty sad while reading, and even after finishing this book. The feeling is kind of double sided...on one hand, it's realistic, but on the other, I wish that there was more than just the pressing feeling of sadness. Also, I was incredibly unsatisfied by the ending. The whole book was all dark and cloudy, and the ending does very little to alleviate that feeling. Once again, it's a double sided situation, but you can decide whether or not it suited your taste.<br /><br />Final verdict: Just read it! Especially if you've read the first two, or if you're going to see the movies. You've got nothing to lose! (No pain...no gain?)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Why she have to die? But even if she didn't die it was still poorly resoluted  and plotinized I feel like I just wasted a year of my life fan girling over this
B007I0OY02|5.0|I laughed through the whole freakin book! Tina Fey is Hilarious, and should write more books, because she writes as funny as she is in her comedy stand ups and shows! More Tina Fey!
B007TR1R22|3.0|I liked it but I thought it was a slow story and the background on the characters wasn't explained enough for me to care about the character.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Eh, You know how you watch a REALLY long movie and you think &#34;that movie did not have to be that long!&#34;, That is how this book is.  I feel like that is how this book is. I feel like the real story did not start until 150 pages in and then it kept deferring away from the real story. And the SPOILERS! If I am going to read a long boring book it is only to figure out what happens at the end which the narrator in the story just so conveniently tells you about in the middle of the book! I think it was a good story, but it would have been a better book if better written.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This is a cute and funny little book of poems. You will laugh and if you have a cat you will really giggle.
B0089LOG02|4.0|It was a very easy read, interesting. Surprisingly there were two different stories and I was intrigued by both of them. Cut out one star for being WAY to hallmarky at the end. The end was just too happy for me. It reminded me of a hallmark movie special you just want to gag.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game, but it doesn't have hard mode, so... you can't get the hallowed armor. Having a fun time pwning my brothers, though...
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|Awesome. Has all of the oldies and goodies. Listen to this all of the time. Takes me back to the 90's. I love them.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Some price on items are just crazy. 2500 for chickens is an example. Especially when they jump to being so much. 375 for two cows then 2500 for chickens? Needs to be adjusted to responsible in the game or more ways to make money for the gamer. Like taxing which was in the original.
B00D6QU6RW|4.0|Typical Backstreet boys. There are good songs on this. Don't know them yet but am learning them each time I listen. Their music is timeless.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I LLLOOOVVVEEDDD this movie. My brother went to watch it twice! Personally i like it better than the first one. The minions are cute and funny as always. I couldnt enjoy as i was hoping because of the stupid people were complaining to parents about their kids, and some parents were trying to calm their kids down, and rude ass people were shushing and getting attitudes..... That realy got on my nerves because YOU SHOULDN'T GO WACH A MOVIE THAT'S GOING TO ATTRACT KIDS IF YOU CANT HANDLE IT!!! WE ALL KNOW HOW KIDS ACT SO Go WACH AN ADULT FILM BIG JERKS!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Why not just get a HDMI cable? What a useless product. But I guess everyone just loves Google everything. Whatever happened to the negative view on company's creating a monopoly?
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Please help me I can not figure out how to update This game I tried so many ways but none of them worked
B00FQUACUM|5.0|I love II Volo voices and enjoy their concerts. Close your eyes and just relax and listen.<br />Their voices are a gift.
0743554450|5.0|The themes in this book are commonplace and familiar against the backdrop of of the Afghanistan story portrayed in Western media over the last decade; yet this story is anything but commonplace because it's told with such empathy, humanity and compassion.<br /><br />I listened to this book unabridged on audio CD narrated by a Atossa Leone. Ms. Leoni is brilliant, a beautiful narration.
B00EDCI5IU|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, pensive... perfect for the long chilly nights and short bursts of daylight that winter in the north brings. A great variety of sounds with simple, clean execution. Absolutely lovely.
0062107313|2.0|I am a huge fan of Amy Tan's, and am so hoping her storytelling skills make a full recovery from a devastating bout of Lyme disease.  Unfortunately, it won't be with this book, which is as overlong as it is overwrought.<br />  WARNING: SPOILER ALERT coming.<br />Okay, you've been warned.<br />The setting -- old Shanghai -- is wonderful, but what begins as a classic Tan story of separation and loss piles tragedy upon tragedy until it reaches ridiculous heights.  As usual, Tan has a gift for fine detail, but the emotional climax comes around page 300 of this 600 page tale, and the story never really recovers.  Pages 300 to about 430 should have been edited out, not only because they test the reader's patience in a prolonged trek though yet another tragedy, but because it puts three years of time between the heroine's child being stolen and her out-of-the-blue decision to attempt to get her back. The heroine's inexplicable passivity about a loss that affects her so deeply is completely out of character, and I kept wondering why she didn't even think about getting the child back until there was a lull in the many life crises of the plot.  By the time we get to the heroine's mother's back story, I no longer cared what happened, I just wanted to finish the book so I could read something else.  All in all, a disappointing -- and extremely long -- read, but since it's better than Tan's last book (Saving Fish from Drowning) I hope she will recapture the magic in some future story.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|very informative!  It turns out that - after watching this and making some changes in my diet - I was able to cut my doctor's bills in (approx.) 1/4.  How they handle - and what they put in - our food is appalling!  This movie is open, honest and unbiased in reporting some of the truths behind the food industry.  You don't want to know what is on this documentary, but you do need to know.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I cannot really rate this item as I did not buy it for myself, but as a gift for a relative who requested it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a very cool and fun game I enjoy playing and getting to see the characters moves that's why I give it 5 out of 5 stars
B002N5N4M6|4.0|I cannot really rate this item, as I purchased it not for myself but as a gift for a relative, who had requested it.
B0087FMUCQ|1.0|Wow this is one of the worst games ever! I mean when I first saw it it look fun but it turns out to be a disappointment. Do not buy this game! Minecraft is much better than this game.<br />Only reason why I like this game is the graphics.
B00DNB9RXO|5.0|I am going to forget for one moment that this game is free on google play. Normally I would rate the game down because of this and would call it a bait and switch.<br /><br />HOWEVER:<br /><br /> This game truly is a work of art. From the way you can control it using your accelerometer, to the very fresh themes and the incredible art design and graphics, this is truly a game unlike any I have ever played before. In fact, I am finding it difficult to describe. It is just something that you have to experience.<br /><br />That being said, I have found no spyware attached to this game of any consequence. Thus, it is safe to download. Get it for free here while it is the free app of the day or if you have missed it go ahead and get it from google play where it is free all the time seemingly.<br /><br />Naught 2 is most likely a game that I'm going to buy after I finish this one because I am truly enjoying it. I love games that give you an honest challenge and this is definitely one of those rare gems. FIVE stars.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Ok, so I'm obsessed with hidden object games in general. Usually I'm left feeling really disappointed with the game itself but I have totally enjoyed playing this one!! Can't wait for my energy to be restored so I can come back for some more Secret Society! Thanks guys!!
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|Unfortunately, this album lives down to my expectations.  It took me 10 years to appreciate &#34;Corporate America&#34; enough to listen to it all the way through (I still skip the girl song, which has no business being on a Boston album to begin with).  I hope I will grow to like it more.  Glad Tom saw fit to include some of Brad's work and it's good to hear what Tommy DeCarlo sounds like.
0071373586|5.0|One of the best books in the industry on branding - highly recommended for anyone in marketing that focuses on branding.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If someone dared to lop 150 pages off Stephen King, this book would be a winner. It's not bad, but there's too much to slog through in the first two-thirds of the book to make it as good as it could be.<br />I enjoyed the last 100 or so pages but never came to really care for the characters, other than perhaps Abra. Nostalgia might bump it up to 3.5 stars.  Many reviews clearly disagreed, so maybe it's just me. It's definitely not a scary book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Not at all would I expected, but an engrossing read that leaves me wondering what might have been.  Definitely recommend this book!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|excellent take on a great classic! i really thought it was a great movie. the actors did a great job
B003ELKNH2|3.0|Honestly, I prefer the original.  The redux just drags along with scenes that could have been left out, And they were!!!  My advice, buy the original.  None of the added scenes add anything but time to an already long movie.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|I love a good heist movie but this movie is a waste of time. It sets up situations that are very implausibly and badly explained. It is sad to see such a strong and talented cast wasted in this mediocrity. You watch this hoping that the narrative improves but alas, it just gets worse and increasingly implausible. To add insult to injury, the ending is truly ridiculous. The worse offense a writer and/or director can make is to conclude the story/movie with a very unsatisfactory ending as you have wasted the audience's time.<br /><br />In an attempt to disguise the rather thin plot, the writer attempts to distract by filling the movie with current populist themes - screw the rich, spread their &#34;ill-gotten&#34; wealth, corporations are evil themes. The usual simplistic diatribe that has perpetuated ad nauseam by the media since 2008 as these themes generate viewership and ratings. If only these themes were put to good use instead of just window dressing for a badly crafted story.
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|It's a documentary of my college experience...............sort of.  I  graduated in 1969.  Yes.  I'd say this is a documentary movie for sure.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise. I went in with little to no expectations and was captivated for the duration of the movie. It is not a short movie as it runs for 124 minutes. For a new director/writer's first outing, I have to say I am impressed. This movie has very strong visuals and the set designs are just remarkable. The story is rather simple but it was well crafted, directed and acted. Sometimes, it is how the story is told that makes up for the simplistic story and here in succeeds. The soundtrack is another pleasant surprise as it fits the movie to a tee.<br /><br />I hope to see more projects from Joseph Kosinski (the director and writer) as this is indeed a most promising start.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Action!  Real Navy SEALs.  Watch the tactics closely.  No way Hollywood could train actors to perform like that!  I love this movie.<br />To those out there in SpecOps..............thank you for your service.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|All the grandkids love this. Although I look at it as a knock off of Minnion Rush-- which the kids also like--  they seem to prefer this game over the Minnions.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|24 got better after the 2th season, jumped into HD digital cameras around the 5th, and keeps rolling right into the eighth. Edge-of-seat, powerful music, and you are kept glued for hours =D
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very disappointed it does not allow me to play my personal content (pics and music) from my tablet to my TV.  If only allow for Netflix, youtube etc...  Most new TV's allow this already.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I will be ordering all my CDs from them from now on.. Thank you so much for the awesome CD:)
0316204366|5.0|Excellent book. Provides interesting and validated analysis on how our actions, however well intended, can have the opposite effect.  Very interesting on how a disadvantage can translate to an advantage in the right situation.
B005HEFB6M|2.0|Very nice sets and effects, but poor acting on the part of many of the principal actors and insipid writing.  I have watched all of the Star Trek based series and this is by far the toughest one to get to like.  So often it takes a season for the writers and actors to figure out how the characters should be best  portrayed, so I've begun to watch season two in the hopes that things will get better.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|This is  wonderful series.  I buy each year's DVD for my 84 year old mother for Christmas every year.  She is a devoted fan.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl definitely lived up to its promises: keeping me up to ungodly hours craving the next sick twist. It's intense, unpredictable, and smart. \\"Unputdownable\\". I would highly recommend reading it but keep in mind the ending is very anticlimactic. However, I do get the point. If you are debating whether or not to read this book based off of these reviews, my advice is to just read it. You won't be disappointed.
B0000062FL|5.0|Santana has always been another of my favorite groups. I really like Carlos Santana. Not only is the Abraxas album great with Oye Como Va, but the CD Inner Secrets is terrific.
0937381888|5.0|Really good, concise book covering the basics of brewing and the science behind it. It's easy to read and has a great glossary to explain the many brewing terms that crop up.

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I was expecting great things. Applause disappointed me at first. It wasn't galactic or amazing. But the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love. It was the same with the entire album. I listened to some of the tracks before the album came out (the I-tunes festival thing), and thought, this sounds depressing, it's not good enough. It didn't help that Zedd was a producer, not when I'd heard what he made. But then the album finally came out and the more I listened, the more the songs grew on me, even ones I disliked at first, like Sex Dreams and Dope. But Artpop (the title track) stands out as, well, art.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Synopsis:  Louisa is a twenty something girl, recently out of a job and looking for any work she can to help support her family.  While working with a recruiter an opportunity comes up to help look after a young man recently hurt in an automobile accident, Will Traynor, a former thrill seeking enthusiast, sky diving, bungee jumping, CEO quadriplegic who is now confined to a wheel chair and severely depressed.  Will cannot move his body below the neck other than some very slight movement in his fingers and requires 24 hour a day in home medical care.  Louisa, mostly due to the pay decides to accept this care taker position as long as she does not have wipe his bum.  She works with Will continuously with the hope of getting him out of the house and back into the world again, not only to lift his spirits but to try and bring back his previous zealous outlook on life.  She will find that in this short time how difficult this task is and more importantly just how difficult all of this is for Will.    My review:  Wow, a powerful book indeed.  I had no idea how this book was going to turn out.  Not just the ending but the story line itself.  This book was beautifully written and definitely a cutting edge story like I have never seen.  My initial fear with this book was that it would be what I call a \\"girly book\\", I was even hesitant to read it because of that fact.  I am not saying that I am opposed to girly books but I didn't want to end up with a sobbing romance novel.  This book was anything but that and still has me sitting here thinking about it.  This is definitely a book club style book, I can very clearly see a bunch of girls sitting around drinking wine talking about this book with tears in their eyes.  Highly recommended!!    My rating:  8  Pages:  369  Author website:  [...]

She says the comedy is in the form of a comic strip and is so hilarious she can't put it down! I asked her if she found out that her cat is plotting to kill her, she said &#34;Actually, all the time!&#34; LoL
0399208534|5.0|A child's classic.  Both of our children loved the book.  I purchased as a baby gift.  Every child needs a copy of The Very Hungry Caterpillar.  Beautifully illustrated, clever story.

B005HEVBGG|5.0|The writing in this show is excellent and the acting isn't too shabby either.  I would probably say go with Star Trek DS9, Star Trek TNG, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek and then Star Trek Enterprise if you have to choose between which shows to watch.

B00H2D1XDQ|5.0|This is beautiful art, Christmas spirit, and the love that comes with the season AND a fun game.  I have ALL of Phatpuppy's games from the Hidden Object Difference Games.  They are really fun because there are so many play options.  I confess that the art is what first captured my attention in buying the games.  When you are tired out at the end of the day, or waiting around at the mall--take a break and play the game.  That's a good way to catch a breather in the midst of the holiday hustle and bustle.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Took almost a year but worth the wait. The game is a blast to play especially if you are a fan of DC comics and the characters.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|I bought this on a whim, after hearing a song recorded by him that isn't on this album. I love it! I would buy it again (and probably will be looking to get the special edition or import version- those usually have extra songs than what's released in the states.) This cd is always on repeat. Even my brother likes it- and he doesn't normally go for old school jazz/blues. I love that Hugh Laurie's voice isn't perfect and for me, that makes these songs so much better. It lends an honest soulful feel to each note.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|If you enjoyed watching The Pacific you will enjoy reading more in depth of Private Sledge and the brave USMC. He draws you into his story.
B004T4KQJS|3.0|The book is very informative, but written in a somewhat &#34;high-brow&#34; tone which made it somewhat hard to understand for someone who doesn't have a background or higher education in quantum mechanics or astrophysics. It felt like the author was constantly trying to prove how smart he is by using &#34;big words&#34; and theories that us normal people may not know.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was not written as I expected a<br />Book to be. I am still left with gaps of what really happened. Still if you enjoy the zombie genre it is must read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say....great read and mostly every woman's dream!  EL James is a great writer and keeps you wanting more!
B005MMZ63C|5.0|A classic motion picture. Old, but timeless theme. Each time I see it, I note something different. One of the best motion pictures of all time.
B009CGCQPU|5.0|Oh the tension of love and the fear of expressing it. The clash between classes and the struggle between being full of pride and comprehending the depth of personal prejudices fill the screen. These two characters and the families they come from depict the dreams of those lacking and the arrogance of the rich and noble. Also there is a great depiction of the hunger of these two potential lovers have and how their communities lack any fulfillment for their hunger. These star crossed lovers fight through their issues and dismantle the social barriers to find each other. Great lines in this move!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|the best detective series since murder she wrote.this will keep you on the edge of your seat with all the mystery an humor.a pleasure to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love figuring out the patterns, I find myself really engaged. I love to do puzzles and this is every bit as addicting as solving, which is what I love to do.
B007DJUO8O|2.0|Bought the album because I'm a big fan of Opeth and like Porcupine Tree.  But this album is boring and doesn't have a good song on it.  Very disappointing.
B0091W1RY6|5.0|It amazes me how the future is depicted, always dark, full of selfish people who have no real purpose and this movie addresses purpose. Eli is on commission to bring a Bible, a nearly extinct book to safe harbor in a whole that is self destructive and lost. A power hunger guy who knows how the Bible might be used to manipulation the masses and is willing to kill to have that power. Corruption verse hope, a the true meaning of purpose. One blinded by ambition and one with a vision for the future.
B003K025TQ|5.0|An excellent album for those who like a large variety of music. There's a little bit of everything here except rap and polka. =D
0545101425|5.0|As always, it is far better to read the books and just seeing the movies, There is so much more information and cause and effect that is not revealed in the movie. I highly recommend reading this series. The inner conversations and thoughts that are never revealed in a movie help you understand the characters better and explain those in the movie who have a small part.
B0000047CX|5.0|Another of Astrud Gilberto's top CD. I am always in the market for more of her music CDs and DVDs.
B009LITFIK|1.0|This product came to me scratched.  It was thinner than the original Nikon LCD protector.  Buy the Nikon \\"BM-11\\" version.  This is a cheap imitation.<br /><br />-jgp
B00701QV0A|5.0|Most of the time, I get one or two hits in the CDs I buy. This time, I got over 7. That is good. Makes the purchase worth it.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The best book I have read on preventing procrastination period.  Buy the book you will not be disappointed.  Enjoy JRE
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed it from beginning to end....waiting to see what's next for  Abra (hint, hint). Stephen King never seems to disappoint.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this app it changes scenes all the time. You hardly find an item in the same place.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Love the game but it's Christmas time & it's still Halloween in the Secret Society ! Also, it won't connect/sync properly with Facebook.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Interesting variation of The Little Mermaid.  Beautiful animation and colors.  A few scary bits, but they don't worry my toddler grandson.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Classic John Grisham small town lawyer story. Loved it. Couldn't put it down till I had devoured it all. Get it now. You will love it.
