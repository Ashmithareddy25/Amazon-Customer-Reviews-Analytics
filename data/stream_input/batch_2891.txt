B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love love this book. very steamy and cannot wait for the movie to come out. if it's as good as the book, could be a really steamy movie.<br />Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pretty spectacular game. I get lost playing. Time flies by when you are having fun! I play this game on a daily basis.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Good story that keeps you surprised until the end. Kate Morton spun a good tale set in war time England.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot.  I ended up finding the tv show as well and read and watched at the same time.  This was a fun read and I saw some of the reviews and knew what I was getting into when I read it.  It was fun to read and get to know Piper.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I loved playing this game on Facebook. I am very glad they brought it to my kindle. Definitely a good game to play.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|While I greatly enjoy the TV series, the books tend to be long, boring, and incoherent. For instance , characters will appear and then disappear, or be apparently forgotten for hundreds of pages. It is a tough slog through Vol 5 where the writing seems to focus on describing every morsel that any of the characters eat, while not moving the plot forward hardly at all. It is not even clear at the end of the book which characters are alive and which are dead. The dragons have virtually no part at all. The great threat from North of the Wall, the undead, also are talked about, but never show up. Catelyn was shown to have survived in the TV show but makes no appearance in the 5th book. Did she die or what? All in all , my advice is to skip this huge waste of time and read something else.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|The Book Marks study group read this together and many questions about the wisdom of the author in making the trip without preparing differently.  Since the boots, back pack (the monster) and her feet played an important role in her descriptions, they can almost be seen as symbolic of the burdens she was carrying within herself.  Interesting read and I was very glad when she reached her goal.  The ending summary was very helpful in understanding her insight and her present status.  kb
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like being able to keep in touch with high school classmates and my children who live in other states.  But I could do this with e-mail.  I enjoy the games, but I don't like having to pay for little tricks that allow me to win.  I find myself going to Facebook less and less.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|I am not a fan of animated movies and rarely watch one.  However, I saw a portion of this movie being played in a tv/audio shop, and I paused and looked at it for several minutes.  At first I thought I was watching &#34;django&#34;.  I had never heard of &#34;Rango&#34;.  When I saw it on Amazon instant video some days later, I made a point to watch the whole movie.  I enjoyed it very much.  Great color, sound, and story.
B00947NAHU|4.0|But important to see.....it's very disturbing, but I'm glad I watched it as hard as it was. Very violent.... But the slave trade was an Evil Hell !!!
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I bought one of these and several other lamps to test for burning man, and we ended up using 4 of these to light our entire camp at night. Very good light output for the size.  Build feels rugged and i did not experience any breakages. 2 step lighting is a plus. If you are needing light in a confined area this lamp may be too bright for that purpose. Best for large areas.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Who doesn't want the slave to win sometimes?  It's a fantasy; however, the story gets to make social commentary that we can use.  How should a freeman be treated?  Like a &#34;peckerwood.&#34;  Like a poor white person.  Our problems are not racial, as some of us insist on believing, they are socio-economic and always have been.  The film is quite funny at times.  I saw it at the movies and knew that I had to own it as well.
B0084670FU|5.0|You have to watch this movie a while before you get the hang of it.  Great color and scenery around the world.  The movie will jump to different locations and actors around the globe, but in the end everything is tied together.  Recommended!
1490313370|5.0|This book is filled with ideas that increase self awareness and motivation for self improvement.  It is an easy read.
1416955070|1.0|I decided to read City of Bones before the movie came out and to see if what all the hype was about. First half of the book was OK. The parts were there was actually demon slaying was by far the highlight of the entire book. And that is about all the good I can say about this book. I had to struggle to finish the last half. The plot and the characters just couldn't hold my attention. I really didn't like ANY of the characters. And the plot was...find the globlet of fire? or something like that  And the \\"twist\\" at the end wasn't really surprising just gross. There are much better books out there-this one will be in my donate pile. Needless to say I wont be reading the other books in the series.
0345803493|5.0|Review of the product, not the book: It shows fingerprints pretty badly b/c of the glossy cover.  That's my only complaint.  Words were clearly printed on the pages.  What else can you ask for in a book?  Continuation from Fifty Shades OF GREY, but you're only 2/3 of the way there by the time you finish this book.  But you're already sucked in.  Might as well go buy book 3 if you haven't already.  You'll need some kind of resolve for this trilogy.
B006BQNJR8|5.0|Great battle scenes with super color and sound.  Not your average sword and spear movie.  Worth watching.  Great views of the country side.

B00EKITOXC|5.0|There are so many things to love about this series.  The acting is superb.  I love that the actors on British TV look like everyday people and don't have to be a supermodel like in the US.  In the first episodes of season 1, the heartbreak the actors portray looks authenticate.  The writing is great.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  I can't wait to find out what happens in the next episode.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although I am retired from teaching I would like the opportunity to recommend this book to mature young readers. The subject of chronic and terminal illness in young people is approached and handily covered in a straightforward, realistic, yet heartfelt &#34;bedside&#34; manner. The characters try their best to live like other teens and their conversational banter reveals this desire yet the kids who are sick and have been for a long time in their short lives have a tentative grit to carry on for those who love them, and for themselves. I am glad I have it handy on my Kindle. I might read it again!
B00CLD65X0|3.0|The production value, acting, dialogue writing, etcetera is just great. Really. The sets, the locations, costuming, everything about this show is great.<br /><br />Except all the characters are petty jerks. The aristocracy are so concerned about their stupid money and social standing one just wants to smack every last one of them hard in the face. I know, \\"people of their times\\" blah blah. They're all jerks.<br /><br />The help are a bunch of hysterical, sycophantic, two-faced ass-kissers. I think its possible they are even more pompous and insufferable then their \\"betters\\". They're jerks too.<br /><br />Turn off the sound and listen to some Elgar and it MAY be possible to enjoy this ridiculous soap opera.<br /><br />The stars are for the production.
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|The DVD of the with the last episode of the first season was somehow damaged and would not play the last 15 minutes of the final episode for that season. This was disappointing.

B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Beevor is a great story teller and leads you through a complicated &#34;history&#34; with the help of a very good narrative. He interlaces the different war theaters in a very clever way giving the reader a sense of continuity difficult to find in other WWII descriptions. The inserts of personal pieces from different combatants are very illuminating.
055357342X|5.0|Can I give this book six stars? Because I really would if I could! George R. R. Martin continues to weave the story of the seven kingdoms of Westeros and beyond in A Storm of Swords, and thus far this is the most jaw dropping book in the series.This installment is that which inspired season 3 of the show, the season that recently left my Facebook and Twitter feed absolutely abuzz with disbelief over things that happen. Let me warn you: do not allow yourself to be spoiled! I was fortunate to have my dear friend Taylore reminding me almost daily not to go trolling through the internet for anything Game of Thrones related. As always, my book reviews remain spoiler-free, so you are free to continue reading here! ;)<br /><br />Almost as if A Song of Ice and Fire is simply one insanely large book, A Storm of Swords continues right where A Clash of Kings left off: with Westeros in the midst of a war for the throne and Daenarys Targaryen slowly but methodically making her way to the Seven Kingdoms to join the fight.  While the self-proclaimed kings plot and fight for the throne, Jon Snow learns more about wildlings and White Walkers as he ventures with a group to explore beyond the Wall. The webs that Martin began weaving in the first two books only grow more intense and the twists and turns are magnified with shocking moments and very unexpected developments between different characters. Like many other reviews I have read noted, I wanted to throw my book across the room multiple times reading this!<br /><br />Even though this was my favorite book in the series, it is still very dense and I found it difficult to read for extended periods of time, depending on which point of view I was reading. But sometimes I just really struggled through the characters, which is a blessing and a curse with these books. Fortunately some new point of views were introduced in this book, most notably Jaime. Hearing his perspective was refreshing and altered my perception of the Lannisters. One of the hallmarks of a great writer is the ability to give multiple dimension to their characters, especially by making the reader sympathize with the \\"enemy\\". When I find myself rooting for Tyrion and Jamie I am reminded at how incredible George R. R. Martin is at storytelling.<br /><br />My favorite point of views are historically those of the Starks, especially Arya. Is anyone else secretly hoping that Arya and Gendry end up getting married someday? I promise I'm not offering any spoilers because as I type this, I haven't read the last 2 books published in this series and there are still 2 books left to be published; but I think Arya and Gendry getting married would be like a symbolic fulfillment of Robert Baratheon marrying Lyanna Stark. Not that George R. R. Martin would ever be predictable...<br /><br />If you haven't started reading George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series (aka Game of Thrones), I highly recommend carving a reasonable amount of time for you to do this! A Storm of Swords is worth the read alone, but you can't understand its beauty without reading the first two books and I promise you won't be able to stop once you're three books in!<br /><br />Bottom Line: The BEST book so far in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series! If this type of story interest you at all, this series is a must read!! 5+/5 stars

0553801473|4.0|It's bittersweet to post this review because it means I'm finished reading all 5 published installments of George R. R. Martin's epic series. I'm really excited to have time to read other things and do other things, but I'm also going to miss reading about these characters daily so much! I've also made so many new blogging friends through this series because clearly it has affected a LOT of people (readers and television watchers alike!).<br /><br />Fortunately at least two more books have still yet to be published in this series, because unfortunately I didn't feel like this book ended the month with a bang as I was hoping it would. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, and I know that this book was a favorite for many of you; however, it fell a little flat for me, similarly to A Feast for Crows (aka AFFC). While I feel like the details are what make this series so incredible in many ways, there may have been too much detail in AFFC and A Dance with Dragons, to the point where the story didn't move forward as quickly as I expected (and needed!). I wish Martin would have compacted both of these books and made them work as one unit as originally intended. I have absolutely no idea how he would have done this (*cough*cut out the Greyjoys*cough* lol), but many of the newer characters still did not resonate with me as a reader.<br /><br />Now, don't get too angry with me, but I was especially disappointed with Dany's storyline; I felt like she did nothing but spin her wheels in this book!! I'm sure if I look deeper there's some great, powerful explication on her need for stability, to stop moving, her fears and doubts. But as a reader, I wanted action! I wanted Dany to keep moving forward and keep stringing bells in her hair! I need to keep reminding myself how young she is and how vulnerable she is, but I also have confidence in her as a reader and want to cheer her on. I really wish I could go into better depth on Dany, but I don't want to spoil anything at all for those ofyou who haven't yet read this book.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my review for AFFC, even the worst George R. R. Martin book is still probably the best of 100 books chosen at random. While I didn't connect with this story as deep as books 1-3 in the series, I still enjoyed the experience of reading tremendously and loved the characters. It was exciting to follow Tyrion's story and some of the new characters were especially promising to meet (like, REALLY exciting to meet. I can't stress that but I can't say more). After reading this book, I am also excited to read theories about the future of the series without being spoiled. The beauty of Martin's writing is that you can never anticipate what is going to happen next. This epic tale is truly an adventure to read and discover, and I hope that I won't have to wait long for the sixth installment, The Winds of Winter! I really don't know how fans who started reading this series in 1996 have survived all of the time between publications!<br /><br />Bottom Line: Not as great as books 1 through 3, but I enjoyed this one a little bit more than A Feast for Crows. A must read for anyone who has already started the series!  4/5 stars
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love clue games so this was fun for me.. I wish there were more levels though. other than that I enjoyed it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book. Loved it so much better than the movie. I highly recommend reading this book. Story with a twist
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|This looked attractive in the &#34;ad&#34; but was a HUGE disappointment! Very stiff ~ Difficult to even actually get the Kindle into it! Gave this away to charity almost immediately!
055358202X|4.0|George R. R. Martin continues his epic tale of war for the Iron Throne in A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in his series A Song of Ice and Fire. This book and its sequel, A Dance With Dragons (book 5), actually take place over the same span of time; A Feast for Crows follows the story mainly of those at or related to King's Landing. As war continues throughout the realm of Westeros, new characters are introduced who vie for the right of King of the Seven Kingdoms. The most important new characters include the Greyjoys and the Martells of Dorne. While Martin continues to weave an intricate web of stories replete with ulterior motives and deceit, this book falls a little flat compared to the previous installments.<br /><br />I think the biggest disconnect for me with this book is the overabundance of new characters that I didn't have any connection to. I feel like Martin killed off the heart of the story in A Storm of Swords and did little to repair the brokenness I had as a reader. Perhaps it was that I failed to trust Martin and therefore didn't want to get to know the Greyjoys and Martells; I have surely learned that GRRM does not have any desire to make me feel warm and fuzzy inside with happy reunions, so why grow attached to new characters? Sure, there were entertaining twists and turns, subtle nuances that kept me on my toes and interesting perspectives from new characters, but overall the lifeline of love I had for the first 3 books was hit or miss this read.<br /><br />Speaking of interesting perspectives from new characters, the best part of this edition was definitely the point of view of Cersei, everyone's favorite evil queen. Getting a glimpse into Cersei's mind helps the reader gain insight as to why she's so crazy and what motivates her to be so evil. I gained a lot of empathy for her by learning her back story and the emotions she felt that drove her toward her actions. Similarly, I really enjoyed Jaime's continued chapter point of views; both are testaments to how incredible George R. R. Martin is at developing complex characters that jump off the page. I am constantly amazed by how transparency and realness of every character Martin creates.<br /><br />Clearly you can't read this far into the series without continuing on, just don't be surprised when there is less life in this book as the previous three. I still gave this book four stars because the worst book by George R. R. Martin is still the best book out of a group of 100 at random, in my opinion at least! The best way I got through this book was with audiobooks, which I never thought I would be able to listen to. But this helped my southern California commute tremendously. Overall, not my favorite book in the series, but worth the read for Cersei alone!<br /><br />Bottom Line: You can't stop reading the series just because this book is often referred to as \\"The Ugly Stepchild of A Song of Ice and Fire\\". It definitely isn't as intense of a read as the first three books in the series, but take your time and read this one anyway. It's worth it in the end! 4/5 Stars.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|i had only heard one of their songs but took a chance on this CD.  It is now one of my favorites because each track is enjoyable from beginning to end.  I enjoy the unique percussion beats along with the vocalists style.
B0000024JN|5.0|These songs come to use from a time when music came from the heart and the gut.  The three guys were original in every way and rose to the top with their talent and imagination.  With the music today being generated by computers and the stars being determined by marketing analysts its refreshing and uplifting to hear something real and original.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Very cheaply made, ugly product. I replaced this as soon as I could with one that  had more protection and was of a different color. I<br />would say to take a &#34;pass&#34; on this one!
0345535421|5.0|In the second book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, readers find Westeros in serious discord. The death of King Robert Baratheon has left his teenage son, Joffrey, in charge of the realm; but with rumors that Joff is Jamie Lannister's bastard child, it seems every man is vying for the throne. Robert's militant older brother, Stannis, and carefree younger brother, Renly, are both challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne respectively; and upon the shocking execution of his father, Robb Stark is more fierce than ever to separate himself as King in the North and rid the realm of Lannisters. Similarly, Daenerys is motivated by the death of her beloved Drogo to press on and claim the iron throne. Armed with her dragons, Dany is stronger than ever, despite ever-present obstacles. But the danger north of The Wall is still looming and Jon Snow is going straight into the unknown beyond. With so many differing opinions, so many secrets, and so much deceit, it's hard to tell if there will be peace in the realm ever again.<br /><br />I was afraid after reading A Game of Thrones that I would get burned out of this series quickly, but on the contrary: A Clash of Kings only reinforced my enjoyment of George R.R. Martin's mythical world. This book picks up right where the last one left off and jumps straight into the action of war. Different character perspectives are integrated as chapters, which was especially helpful in seeing every side's perspective. While I may not agree with a character's claim to the throne, reading their reasons and motivations for seeking power through people on their side made me more sympathetic to their plight. It really calls to question what is right by the law versus what is right for the kingdom. My only complaint is that the reader does not get this experience with Renly; I would love to hear his perspective and think he should have been afforded at least a chapter or two.<br /><br />My favorite element of this book actually isn't the politics or war, but the fact that the Stark children are all spread out and separated from each other and have to use their individual survival skills to find a way back together, not to mention cope with the death of their father. Robb is fighting in the thick of war, Jon is on The Wall, Sansa is stuck in the castle ultimately as a Lannister hostage, Arya is pretending to be a boy joining the Night's Watch, and Bran and Rickon are waiting at Winterfell for their family to return. I love seeing how these children utilize what their parents have taught them to get by each day and how they are all such survivors. I really hope none of them die and am praying to read some really incredible reunion scenes in the future!<br /><br />One thing that differed from the first book is the increased element of magic. Without magic, some things are somewhat predictable; but with magic, all bets are off! At times, this made me frustrated because the utilization of magic doesn't make for a fair fight and doesn't always seem to make the most sense (i.e. with Bran). But this additional dynamic definitely adds to more drama and brings the story to a new level.<br /><br />Overall, this book was about war, but Martin continues to impress me with the way he strings his stories together with character experiences, crossing time and culture to build a timeless a story about relationships and politics. This story doesn't have as defining of an ending as its prequel, so that means if you read it, you're definitely going to have to press forward straight to part 3: A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you read A Game of Thrones, you definitely can't miss this one! Once you've started, you just can't stop! 5/5 stars
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Such a huge disappointment. Even though it was about magic, it was totally unbelievable and corny. Big names, bad movie

0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones, the first book in the series titled A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R.R. Martin has been haunting me for quite some time now. I have friends who have been pressuring me to read it and friends who have been pressuring me to watch the series on HBO. I can't watch something and then read it (I learned that lesson with The Princess Bride) so I needed to read it. But at 864 pages, it was hard to carve out the time and dedication for this monstrous book, not to mention its sequels. Additionally, I kept hearing about how confusing it is to keep up with the huge cast of characters which only made me more apt to push the book off longer. I'm very proud to report that I have finished A Game of Thrones, and if you have been pushing this book off as much as I was, I'm going to help encourage you to tackle and enjoy it as much as I did!<br /><br />The fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice series takes place long ago in a faraway land where seasons can last lifetimes and supernatural creatures dwell outside The Wall of the Seven Kingdoms. Confused yet? Well, let me break down the cast of characters to help you understand better than the publisher's synopsis. In A Game of Thrones there are mainly 4 families or \\"houses\\" with which you need to concern yourself:<br /><br />  House Stark: Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark is the head of this house and he is the Warden of the North. Ned governs with a strong adherence to honor, duty and integrity and doesn't like to play games when it comes to getting things done.<br />  House Baratheon: The house of King Robert, one of Ned's best friends from his youth (Ned helped him win the crown). King Robert has become a lush as he has gotten older, prioritizing wine and women over governing the Seven Kingdoms.<br />  House Lannister: This is the house the Queen comes from, along with her twin brother, the Kingslayer, who (as his name implies) killed the previous king. This is also the richest house in the entire Seven Kingdoms, and, as you can only imagine, he who holds money holds power.<br />  House Targaryen: The house of the previous monarchy. Only two descendents from the king remain: Viserys and Daenerys, the son and daughter of the slain king. Throughout his entire life, Viserys has been plotting to win back the throne and he uses his naive, sweet sister to help make this happen.<br /><br />When Ned Stark is approached by King Robert Baratheon to be the Hand of the King, Stark is honored but doesn't really want the job. The previous Hand of the King, one of Stark's best friends and brother-in-law by marriage, is suspected of being murdered. Driven by honor and duty, Stark takes the job and begins to uncover secrets at the capitol, King's Landing, that complicate his job and friendship with the King. At the same time outside The Seven Kingdoms, Viserys Targaryen is arranging a marriage between his sister and a savage Dothraki leader so that he may gain military power to take back his father's throne. Finally, on the other side of The Wall, the looming danger of wildlings and White Walkers breaking through into Westeros is more present than ever. Ned Stark's level headed leadership may be the only thing that can strengthen the kingdom enough so that it can defend itself from whatever threatens them beyond their borders; unless, of course, the most dangerous enemies are already within the castle walls.<br /><br />First of all, I was more stressed out than I needed to be about the huge cast of characters in this book. YES, there are a ton of characters, but one of the many talents Martin has as a writer is structuring his books in a way that gives the reader ample time and information about major characters so that you remember them. And you will remember them; the characters, whether \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys\\" are colorful, memorable and multi-dimensional. I did have a little trouble with minor characters, but I read this on my Kindle and was able to simply search the book for the first time a character in question was mentioned to refresh who they are (I highly recommend this!). I also googled images of the characters as I read to better imagine them (at least the way HBO imagines them).<br /><br />Each chapter alternates between the points of view of different characters which gives the reader insight into experiences happening all over the realm and beyond. After reading the first book I can't begin to imagine the effort it must take Martin to craft together this masterpiece of a story. Each character has their own experience, truly unique to them and through these experiences a world is developed by stringing them together and mixing them with each other. Martin's way of storytelling is incredibly impressive once you've really immersed yourself into his story.<br /><br />Some major topics this book examines is the importance of family, honor, duty and power. Ned Stark's children alone are worth writing about and examining their relationships with each other and their parents, most notably Ned's bastard, Jon Snow. A Game of Thrones is another book I wish I could have read in college because many papers could have been written about the themes and motifs in this story. I also found the role of women in this time to be very interesting, especially looking at Arya Stark, a tomboy. When most women are either ladies or prostitutes, I enjoy seeing Arya forge a new way for women.<br /><br />I could probably write for days about all the arcs and themes I loved in this book, but since this is a review and not a thesis, just believe me when I say that there's something for everyone: adventure, mythology, romance, deceit, mystery, politics, murder, monsters, and everything in between.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you like complex but salacious very long stories, I highly recommend this! I know it isn't for everybody, but if you think you'll like it, you probably will! I advise carving out a good amount of time to dedicate to the entire series since there are 5 books averaging 1000 pages each and 2 more to be published in the future! 5/5 stars!acter in question was mentioned to refresh who they are (I highly recommend this!).

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I watched all three seasons in a matter of three weeks, and would have done more if I could have. The charm of Downton is unlike any other! Normally I watch shows such as Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead and had worried Downton Abby might be too slow for me. I'm glad I gave it a try.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book really pulls at your heart strings. Wonderful story and beautifully written. Excited to see the movie and how it portrays the book
B0063GORYU|4.0|This a great game.  Very fun.  The only thing is that I haven't figured out how to customize the background.  It tells me unable to select picture and not sure why.  Otherwise, definitely worth getting.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it, a little slow but I still play it every night. Just like the movie, good graphics. Lots of cute characters.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I gave chuck season four and five as a gift. she loves the show so im sure she will love the dvds
B005721W9O|5.0|This film attempts and achieves an outrageously perfect homage/parody of star trek and trekkies, unparalleled in cinematic history!  It matches the original series in rambunctious panache and perhaps even surpasses it in finesse.  If you're not a trekkie, don't bother, just watch a Matlock rerun or perhaps plant some corn and watch it grow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it I love horse. They are so pretty. I want a big horse one day cause of this nice game. Its pretty easy to work on
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very touching story with great compassion.  I definitely recommend it to others for reading.  We need more books like this..
B00267QOEQ|5.0|great movie  I love adam sandler hes my fav  im trying to get all his blue rays  if u come across anymore post them here
0694003611|5.0|Every child should have this book. If I am not mistaken it comes in several different languages. Buy it now.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I love Glee and am happy I can order as little as one episode at a time depending on my budget! Great Buy! Thanks!
B00004T9UF|3.0|i love eminem but this cd only has a few good songs but imma keep collecting his cd's cuz hes the best
B004U7JYXS|5.0|I love it. It really works and I love takibg pictures witg my Polaroid camera and now I can. Its awesome
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love this book / trilogy!! A must read set. I and several coworkers Highly recommend this. I can't speak high enough about it!!

B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Can't wait for more weapons there are so mush more to add! The 1911 the mp40 and way more! Hope to see more updates! 10/10
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Not too late, though... James makes a compelling case for aggressively pursuing the best in you, and when you can't seem to find it go ahead and decide to change yourself to create that person you would like to be, offering valuable, practical and proven advice on ways to do it.  No more excuses! Stop blaming other people and circumstances in your life! You ARE the maker of yourself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its great cause you can build anything you want plus you can do survival mode with a big touchpad t<br />so you can play
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I GREW UP WATCHING THE SMURFS  LOVE THIS MOVIE  THEY COULD NOT HAVE PICKED A BETTER ACTOR  THEN NEIL PATRICK HARRIS
B0091LS07E|5.0|If you don't have this, GET IT. I love when I can listen to a disc from beginning to end. Mrs. Keys delivered!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Not only do my grandsons love this show, but our daughter, my husband and I really enjoy it as well. The humor is exquisite at times - we've always loved British humor anyway -  and even though there is no dialog, the humor comes through loud and clear. Humor such as this doesn't have to be so obvious as to be boring - and yet we don't have to be prompted to laugh by an irritating laugh track.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Okay, I do not know if this is a generational movie or not because my husband and I loved it. Our college and teens- it was okay. I think for we older adults that if you loved these actors in their younger days then you will love them here. Bruce Willis was his usual dry wit and Mary Louise - brilliant! I thought the dialogue was funny, loved 'the pig' and the plot was expected but still good. And, let's face it, anything with Helen Mirren and Bruce Willis will be good. Heads up- Reds 2 is even better!
B001N4OX82|5.0|SEEN IT BEFORE  LOVE IT GREAT ACTION MOVIE  GIVE IT 10 STARS  WOULD TELL MY FRIENDS TO GET IT  A MUST SEE
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Fun and easy to start playing. But continues to challenge you through out the game with stronger demons and quests.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|There are a few details that don't fit, but overall, it is a good Anthony Hopkins-type story.  We love looking at the marble rolls that were made for this movie.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Loving this album. It really takes me back. I was skeptical that Black Sabbath was going to pull this off, but they didn't disappoint!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|VERY GOOD SHOW  WAS HOOKED FROM THE FIRST SHOW  AND WILL KEEP ON WATCHING  THE MAKE UP  IS OUTSTANDING  CANT WITH THE GET THE 3RD SEASON
B001NLL93W|4.0|I found the main characters interesting and the story line entertaining. I did, however, find many of the passages throughout the Mortal Instruments series overly familiar, as if I'd read them somewhere before. While entertaining, I unfortunately I found few scenes in any of the stories in the series particularly memorable. Since I read this book more than a week ago, followed closely by the final books in the series, it's hard to remember exactly what happened in this book.
B004ZN9J0K|5.0|While I have most of their catalogue, I'm partial to the first 2 albums. They set the tone for all their later material.
B004X80QNG|4.0|Well structured, easy to use. Primary tabs are color coded, mail could use color coding, but beyond that effective and easy to use.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|VERY GOOD MOIVE  VERY ENTERTANING  YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE AS MUCH AS YOUR KIDS  A GREAT LOVE STROY WITH A TOUCH OF COMEDY
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love playing more sophisticated games, but most of my family doesn't. Catan winds up being a good compromise for us all - it's sophisticated enough for me, but simple enough that even our 11 year old niece loves to play.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Laid the foundation for Dark Side of the Moon, but it is edgier, less refined than it's more commercially successful successor.
B000ITF86E|5.0|McLintock is hilarious. Great movie with timeless actors. Would highly recommend to anyone who loves classics. I've seen many times and would watch it again.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works like a charm. I love it. It's so easy! This app. makes my printer and phone best friends. I don't know what I did before e-print.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I enjoyed  this  book  very much.  Reacher  is a great character who you know it's always going to get his man
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Doesn't get the credit that it deserves. Some of their best work. One of my favorite guitar solos of all time.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|Just as described was there somethin else in mind or what can't blieve I'm bein bothered by this by Joe
B004UIOUHC|1.0|On checking out the thing I found that it tracks all of your internet usage add presumadlly reports to third parties so I decided not to download and use it,
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the entire Series.  I couldn't wait to continue on to the next episode.  I am looking forward to the next Season!!!
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|Pure Genius! Check out his solo material (Madcap Laughs). Too bad he overdid the LSD and fried himself. The band eventually came back around and paid proper tribute to him with Wish You Were Here.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I remove this app when I tried to use it and it said there is no connection with Amazon and would not run without a connection
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great read. If you like thought provoking adventure books then this is a must read. Not the most action packed book but it always keeps you entertained.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wanted to spend the entire evening watching the season but held off just to make the experience last longer.  I truly enjoyed watching each episode.
B0096BIENY|5.0|at the voices of these four young men. . .sit in your favorite chair, put your head back. . .close your eyes. . .and free your mind from the days cares. . .
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Excellent instruction manual on how to do manly stuff. Flare gun to GATO unit, defuse bombs, program stop lights, stop nuclear meltdown, weld with pocket change and a car battery, win, joust, make booby traps, evade booby traps, shamelessly own a mullet, remove a dress with a paper clip and string, help out a friend, and kick some ass!  All that and a lot more! Instructional, informative entertainment!
034580404X|5.0|I read these on my kindle but had to buy them in print. GREAT READ&#62; hubby enjoyed me reading them as well.
B004X80QNG|1.0|If you want a good app like this I suggest ColorNote its free too but better. This app is a very broken POS not worth the price of free. If i would have bought this for nine bucks it would have been a waste of money. Functionality over aesthetics.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|\\"Mothership\\" is a perfect compilation for casual fans of Led Zeppelin-You get all their signature songs like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\",\\"Heartbreaker\\",\\"D'yer Maker\\",& \\"Stairway To Heaven\\"-Great listen from start to finish.
B00009R86L|5.0|I got my first Domke shoulder pad for my Domke F-8 small shoulder camera bag back in the early/mid-80s. Even wrapped in a bandanna, I finally wore it out so I needed to replace it. The new pad: better than the original! Great job, Domke!
0679720200|4.0|When I read Albert Camus's The Plague I developed a temporary phobia of rats, but I already had a healthy phobia of homicidal sociopaths, so The Stranger (or The Outsider or L'Etranger) was really building on a strong foundation to begin with. Too much \\"Criminal Minds\\" late at night. The Stranger is narrated by the cold, seemingly apathetic Meursault, and the story begins with his mother's death. Camus is the type of writer who doesn't take anything for granted and just goes ahead and smacks you in the face with symbolism, and if his character is a heartless bastard (*cough* Meursault *cough*), then Camus will let you know it when Meursault doesn't cry at the funeral, drinks coffee and smokes a cigarette with the undertaker over his mother's body in the morgue, and leaves without paying respects at her grave. Let me back-pedal. Meursault isn't heartless. He's simply highly logical, and death represents a finality that shouldn't be mourned.<br /><br />[...]
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I dont know about Apple TV, but what I know about this is, Its Flawless.<br />It again reminds us how great Google Engineers are. I am an Engineer and appreciate the smartness of this device. And on top of it, its open source. Damn Google, I wish I was as smart as you :)<br />I usually use Youtube and Netflix, and both work very well.<br /><br />35 is 5 cheapass burritos.<br />Its dynamite.<br />G
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I always love me some Buddy Guy!  Blues guitar can hardly be beat and you can always count on Buddy for great lyrics.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|It's a super upbeat and fun album. A great variety of love songs with some great new songs. I LOVE IT!!
B004X80QNG|4.0|I live by this calendar. It will sync with my outlook calendar, because this syncs with the android, which syncs with the outlook. Was also having issues with having to &quot;sign in&quot; to appstore. I contacted them and they responded quickly.  Apparently, something about digital verification of authenticity, or something. Let them explain it. But, it's currently working fine again without getting the pop up to sign in.<br />I don't use any to do list or toodledo, or whatever. I downloaded the kindle fire version on my kindle, which is way cooler looking than the phone verson. But it doesn't sync with the phone. Go figure. Would be great if it did.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is super fun. The career mode offers several tracks and cars. It's really a lot of fun. Multiplayer racing on an Android app? I think it pushes this game over the edge. It's all I've been playing for a week now. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Enjoying it so far. Tutorial walkthrough nice. Still beginner levels. Loaded slow but fine on the regular Kindle fire. No glitches.lol
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Nobody does what Neil Gaiman does. This simple, beautiful novel infuses the everyday with magic and horror. A must read.
B00CFYAT6O|3.0|This was a \\"guess\\" buy, as it is not what I normally listen to, but it worked out pretty well. Great female vocals with a jazz/blues basic theme, an excellent group of musicians, good variety in the song list-even though one is a remake, and overall a good CD.
B00BC0PEEY|3.0|Please note that my star rating is for the blu-ray image quality ONLY - the movie would have gotten 5 stars!<br /><br />Replaced DVD with blu-ray - was very excited to get this. After viewing I was disappointed with the image quality - and in fact it did not look that different from the DVD (I have a calibrated Epson 6010e projector and 10' screen). I looked up the review on Blu-Ray.com and discovered that it was \\"probably\\" mastered from the original HD DVD master tape, which explains a lot of things. This is a great movie and one of my favorites but it needs to get a proper restoration before the print ages any more. When that comes out I guess I will buy it again - but only after I read the review. My copy IS better than the DVD, but only marginally so. I think it would look fantastic with the right care and attention during the transfer. Audio needs some work too but that's a minor quibble next to the image quality.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|What a great movie showing that just because we age, doesn't mean we lose our talents.  Especially when we have the support of friends, as well as the faith in ourselves.
B008469DGY|5.0|Loads of entertainment. This is without a doubt the Best golf game i've ever played. Beautiful courses and flawless fun!
B00BQ1D7BQ|3.0|I expected much more from these three. The vocals are not great, the guitar is not nearly what it could have been, there aren't really any 'great' songs on it, and overall, I am very disappointed.
B002MG2ATY|4.0|It was hard to keep up at first and the sound is pretty low but it was great. It is a pretty slow and long movie with a lot packed into a couple of hours. Highly reccommend.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|A very creative show. Some shows produce a not so strong first season, but this was not the case for Fringe. It fulfills the suspense/strong plot, which now I rely on shows like Castle and Bones for.
B003QSPTAY|4.0|Great for movie night with the younger grandkids. My tween grand daughter enjoyed it. She had never heard of Hayley Mills before
B00634GHJA|4.0|Good for android to android. A little quirky android to windows. Not bad when it is free on Amazon. Overall good app.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|I go to the movies every weekend. My choice of movies are comedies. I have seen a lot of funny movies and chuckle through them but..... this movie had me busting up the whole time. In People magazine they only gave this movie a 2 star rating. I am not sure what critics they used for that rating but let me tell you I am glad I did not pay attention to that and seen it anyway. I think they need to get let the viewers be the critics for they are the true test. A MUST SEE MOVIE!!!! Not intended for younger viewers. There is a lot of profanity and a couple nudity spots, My son is 16 and I did take him, after all schools today use language just as bad, same as TV, so... it is not new to older teenagers. I would like to say that as parents it is our job to teach our children that it is just a movie and the behavior is not acceptable in the real world!!!!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|evin though I had to watch it on an 19&#34;monitor the movie was very intense in spots,hept my interest thrugh the entire movie.I seen the first one and liked it,this one I like even better.the way they brought all these stars together in one film how could they have gone wrong.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I love the new reincarnation of Star Trek. Characters are believable and the photography, editing is great. Benedict Cumberbatch is great in everything he does
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun game and moves quick. People seem nice but no chat available. Hopefully will get chat set up.<br />Facebook doesn't make it easy to connect.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|When I first downloaded this game it was working fine but now it won't even work half the time. Whenever I swipe to jump or duck nothing happens and I die
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that you have a choice of games and that you can change some settings. I also like that you can undo a bad move.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This Sex & The City Movie. is The Funnest Movie That i Ever Had the Chance to Own. Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte. & Miranda. Makes me Laugh in This Movie. These Four Women Remind Me of My four Selfs. i Think of My Self as a Little Like Carrie, Tough as Samantha, Sweet but Kind As Charlotte. is very Strong as Miranda. I am Glad that Hbo Made this Show & how it is out on Dvd ofr any Ladies who Like Watching these Four Ladies Taking a Thrill out of New York!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I recently bought this app and at first It is a very entertaining app that keeps you glued to play.  So I invested a total of 20.00 to buy bucks so I can easily purchase in game dinosaurs and more buildings. Not long after creating a nice zoo did some already purchased expensive dinosaurs started missing.  So I decided to start over but again dinosaurs would go missing so I quit.  The game itself is fun but dissapointing if im gonna build something for it to go missing .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game! Who wanted a pony when they were a kid? Now you can have one. The<br />graphics are great also
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|First off, I love Leonardo DiCaprio, he is one of my favorite actors, so in my eyes, he can do no wrong. But I wish the character Daisy acted more like the she does in the original movie. In this movie you can feel so bad for her at times, and you don't really see how spoiled and money obsessed she is like she should be. It was just a great movie. I will watch it over and over.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I think The Cast of Sex & the City Really Made a Greatest Movie When they Made This Second Sex & the City. it Has Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha, Miranda. Back it This Movie. Samantha Goes to the Middle East for a Deal & Takes Carrie, Charlotte & Miranda with Her for a Day of Fun Romance, & a Tour of the Middle East in this Very Funny Movie. i am Such a Big Fan of Sex & the City & i am Glad that i Now have This to Add to my Movie File!
B00821OX98|4.0|This is an action-packed show with lots of episodes so you can really get to know the characters! Great series!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The characters keep growing (many times despite themselves), yet the core of this series is still fun and laughs. The earlier seasons are on TV everywhere and it doesn't matter if I've seen an episode, once or many times, I can still catch a portion and enjoy some laughs. I hope they continue forever as long as they can maintain this quality.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I no longer have to lug around a large print Bible, concordence and other study materials. This Kindle App on the Bile is a GODSEND!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book starts slow, like all the others.  The best part is always the last section.  But it is a page turner
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great game with a good story! The hidden objects are sometimes hard to find, but I like a challenge. I can't wait for the sequel!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is awesome. Clever writing, interesting and creepy characters, deliciously evil. not surprising that the folks from Nip/Tuck are doing this show. it definitely has a similarly dark vibe. Evan Peters and Denis O'Hare are fantastic, and i may even be a Jessica Lange fan after this show. Can't wait till season 3 begins!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|fun and easy game to play. don't have to use real money to get far. its very relaxing to build your own small town.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book starts slow, like all the others.  The best part is always the last section.  But it is a page turner
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Entertaining.  Gritty sci fi flick.  Decent story.  The Stallone dredd was very cartoony, this is more real (for sci fi).
B0085YOD1A|3.0|The estimated is sometimes off at first but usually gets back on track after a little bit. Got it when it was the free app of the day.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|This was a very entertaining film for my kids and me. Once I put it into the dvd player it never came out..
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Love this cd every track is wonderful. I will add it to my collection of great music by John Legend. I encourage everyone to buy it
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|very addicting when waiting for time to fly by. have used this more in doctors offices than i care to count.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|If you like this game I recommend you buy the extra upgrade. It comes with more levels to complete and hopefully more to come.
B008E374PO|5.0|I like this alot!I recommend this to anybody who likes quality stuff! Great music for working, relaxing, thinking and everytrhing else you do!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie has some great actors, but they failed to make the most of the lineup.  It's got some action, and some kind of story and plot.  Overall I wouldn't have picked this as my movie for the weekend.  There are better options and worse options out there.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|several politicians have distained this movie-reason enough to see it .the entire cast is awesome and the music at the beginning sets the mood .i am watching it again to see all i might have missed the first time
B00DDRKDUO|5.0|Watain is an amazing band that never stop impressing me.  I love all their albums and this new monster is no exception.  The songs are awesome, the riffs are amazing throughout, the vocals are great and the drums of war are awesome.  Great album, awesome band that has yet to dissapoint.  Great release \m/  Hail Watain!
B001EO748M|5.0|King Henry changed wives but more importantly he changed history. The Tudors is Awesome educational entertainment at its very best.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I love it! Well done. Great blend of action and humor. Too bad only 5 seasons.  Well worth your time.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|OH.MY.GOD!!! THIS BOOK WAS OFF THE CHARTS FANTASTIC!!!! A DEFINITE MUST READ!!!<br /><br />I had such a hard time putting this book down to do work or sleep. I can't tell you enough on how HILARIOUS this book is. I was practically laughing every time I turned the page. My word of advice is: Just read it!! Why do I consider this a must read?<br /><br />What makes this book a \\"Must Read\\"?<br /><br />1.) Drew is frickin OFF THE HOOK HILARIOUS!!!<br /><br />2.) Mackenzie will steal your heart! SO ADORABLE!!<br /><br />3.) Kate can give as good as she gets... YOU GO GIRL!<br /><br />4.) The writing style is like one I have never read before. With the book being written in the POV of Drew it's told as if Drew were having a conversation with you the reader. GENIUS!!<br /><br />5.) The story will suck you in. I mean who doesn't love a book where you read about the transformation of an individual who thought they could never be transformed. It's almost like you want to laugh in their face and say \\"Ha Ha, One day buddy. You'll see, it'll happen to you!\\"<br /><br />Ok.. So just an overview: The story is HILARIOUS and ADDICTING! Be warned! I am not kidding when I tell you I was in love with the book from page one! It was really worth the sleep deprivation I suffered. ENJOY!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|It works very well.  I don't trust my battery operated alarm clock since there is no &#34;low battery&#34; signal.  And besides that, my alarm clock loses alot of time and is a pain to reset.  This is always there and it does wake me up.

B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend is beginning to remind me of the Whispers' song from years ago, he just gets better with time. Some people may not value the type of sound he brings because he plays a brand of classical music and looks too clean cut. But one shouldn't judge that and you can't deny the fact he is very gifted at what he does. Love In The Future helps show off that gift as his theme is one that has been a common one from all the recent R&B albums, restoring love. For John that means not only restoring love in R&B songs but love in the future.<br /><br />I quite loved the album right off the bat, but I did have to take a day and let it marinate as I listened to Jaheim (Man it has been a great week in R&B!) so that I could come back and really truly appreciate the album he put together. He does dabble some in bringing other elements and instruments in on some of the CD with the production. But there is more than enough tracks where he simplifies and breaks it down to where it is just him, his voice and his talented piano playing. You have tracks like Open Your Eyes that has guitar edge to it and borrows the chorus from Common's The Light(Bobby Caldwell borrowed) and also has a Stevie Wonder feel to it. Made To Love brings in hard drum sound to elevate the energy on the album while Who Do We Think We Are brings together hip hop, soul and classical. Matching what could be an odd couple in Rick Ross's tough and gruff gangsta with John Legend's clean cut gentleman with a sound that could be described like a 70s hard but smooth, rolling around gangster's anthem is a true listening pleasure. That bass guitar rides heavy and funky! After he gets more back to his duets with him and his piano in songs like the beautifully crafted All Of Me, loving your significant with all of their curves, edges and imperfections(physically and spiritually). It is easy to get caught up in the good and attraction of someone, but you realize you love someone when you accept their flaws and willing to still be with them. Hold On Longer seems so melancholy in saying to keep holding on cause love will find you even if it doesn't seem that way at times. But then he does flip it on a song I love called Tomorrow, where he sees when you do see the love you have been looking for that don't wait til tomorrow cause you may miss out. Wanna Be Loved hits a homerun on its focus, in how everyone is looking to be loved by someone. That can go for couples or familial relationships to me, but when heart doesn't feel it can go wrong. Probably why there is so many problems in the world cause hearts have been burned or hurt by what they thought was love. This one has more keyboards with a sprinkle of piano but it still sounds great. A song I wished they had did a full cut of is Angel, the duet with Stacy Barthe. They spiced up the Anita Baker version with some funk and jazz with bass guitar and trumpets to go with low whispering vocals. Man! Why couldn't they do 4 minutes? But it is a hidden gem. If You and I is not the absolute best cut, it is right there in the running. A song that could make a couple feel like they are on an island away from everyone else and any distraction in the world, this song could be a dedication to your special lady to let her know she truly is \\"the one.\\" The low, then high buildups along with mixing in guitar and horns makes this a definite standout! The wrap up songs Asylum and Caught Up bring out that crazy in love feel and unleashing it on(or in however you want to look at it :)!) each other to send the album out differently from the John Legend sound you may expect, but giving off that staying in love vibe.<br /><br />People want to feel like they are getting value when they put down $10-$15 on an album and not feel like they got duped. Spending $30 on 3 CDs in economy that is still on recovery mode can feel like an even bigger risk. But forking over that cash for the three I got this week, I felt as if I got more than what I bargained for includingMr. Legend's Love In the Future. Well worth the price of admission! This could be, very well be his best since Get Lifted. He might be an artist that you either love him or he is not your cup of tea. This CD may very well continue that because he doesn't really try to persuade people cause he stays with his style that helped put him on. But for those who may not be a fan of his, if you give it a chance I feel you may come away surprised at what you get. R&B is finally starting to turn around! Thank goodness. Maybe a little bit of love can do the same for the world. It is sort of far-fetched because the world may be too far gone to turn back now and I'm a cynic. But I said the same about the R&B game and it is showing me different. Maybe the world can follow suit... If you pass on the message that John gives here along with others that have released recently, it may very well be possible. Thank you, John Legend! You and your compatriots are helping me to believe again.

B00CATONCA|5.0|firstly i could not beleive the speed in which it arrived. very impressed. the box set is fantastic. they have certainly out done themselves. this has to be one of the best box sets ive seen. if i had to gripe about anything its that inside the box set there are 4 pertruding knoches that mark the box with the discs in when you are taking them out and putting them back. can be a little stiff i would reccomend not putting the dvds fully in the box as it is hard to remove them. overall i am extremely happy with this. thinking of ordering the other box sets now.

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Dumb question: is it me or is this Daniel Craig's final Bond movie?  If so, it was an appropriate ending to his time as 007 given how the movie ended and all.  If not, then it'll certainly be interesting to see how the next Bond movie picks up.  Nonetheless, if you're a Bond fan, you can't pass up on this movie; and if you're not, but like a good movie, then you must still watch this one.  I'm giving it 3 stars only because I thought some parts were too slow, but really I'd give it a 3.5.  Not the best Bond (even for Craig), but still enjoyable.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|When my wife wanted to watch this, I laughed.  Based on the title, I was like, &#34;WTH are you about to watch?!&#34;  But she then showed me the trailer and I remembered that this movie received a lot of good reviews.  I have to say, it's surprisingly good and funny -- even more so when you don't have a lot of expectations.  Sure, a zombie rom-com of sorts sounds almost unbelievable, but they really make it work and do a good job in its overall execution.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Very new and exciting series. Great idea for an intriguing story. I especially love seeing how members of the cast are mixed with new and old talent.
0545265355|5.0|I have loved these books from the moment I started reading them. Having the set all together is just awesome.
B000H5TH1Q|3.0|I now understand why most critics detest Brian De Palma. I remember seeing this when it came out and even on cable, in its infancy (so no edited version).  What I completely forgot about is what a blatant rip-off of VERTIGO this is...and a sub-par version at that.  Now, if it wasn't an obvious VERTIGO double (hence the title) I would say it was a very good movie. Watching it, now that I own it (as well as VERTIGO) I can only say...as a Director, has never (with the exception of CARRIE) done anything original.  Buy VERTIGO, far better.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I play bingo blitz all the time on Facebook and even on my smart phone with minimal problems but on my tablet it's another story. It freezes a lot. It lags quite often. But the worst problem is the power up situation. When I click for the first power up, it doesn't activate until the second one is clicked. Then, the second power up doesn't display at all and the third one (when I can get it) works just fine. I love this game but it has a lot of issues that need to be addressed for the Kindle version of the app.
0385720920|5.0|i've read two other books by this author and loved every dark, depraved, insightful word, but THIS particular book had me laughing out loud the entire first 2/3rds of the book before becoming every bit as surprising and unreal as you would expect.  i highly recommend this book!

B004UID2LC|2.0|I only used this app for downloading kids videos so I wouldn't be able to be connected to WI-FI to entertain my infant. He loves the nursery rhyme videos. So I was able to make a 20 playlist of about 10 videos. Which is great when in the car or at a game etc. But the only thing is the playlist will only play one a day without my kindle needing a reboot. So I play it in the a.m. to pay it at night I need to reboot my kindle. Also sometimes the videos won't play but the sound will and won't cut off even when you force stop the app
B002LHTRV8|4.0|One of my favorite Johnny Depp movies. I recommended this movie to my family member and they enjoyed. I would watch this movie over and over again. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like this alarm. I just wish that it wouldn't ask me to upgrade everytime I open it. If I wanted an upgrade...Id bought the full version in the first place. Other than that...the functions are pretty much the same as a cell phone and its easy to operate.

006178480X|5.0|I've been a fan of Mr. Rollins' work from the beginning, at least under the Rollins name. I read a SUBTERRANEAN ARC while working part time at a Waldenbooks. He's never failed to entertain me.<br /><br />His books combine history, the latest science, both fact and theories, with his dose of fiction loaded with action all the way.<br /><br />Here we have Ghenghis Khan, Attila The Hun, St. Thomas woven into a tale that combines comets, dark energy, warped time, and a race to save the world from destruction.<br /><br />Once again, a superb novel.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I wanted to see this movie when first came out. I liked even though the movie started out very slow but picked up. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B00A2H9OSK|3.0|First I want to talk about baseline tolerance. You know how some people have to put on more cologne each day just so they can smell it, while the rest of us gag? That is baseline tolerance.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Computer Generated Imaging: Starting with the 1973 Yul Brynner oater \\"Westworld\\" and decades later \\"Avatar\\" in 2009, we have seen so much CGI, we gag. Hollywood can't seem to smell it yet and I admit some of it is dazzling, but how about a good script? Lots of cologne can't mask a failure to bathe, nor can lots of CGI mask a lame script. Which brings me to this third installment of a third Vin Diesel franchise (\\"Fast and Furious\\" and \\"xXx\\" are two others); it has brilliant CGI but some of the dialog made me wonder how the actors kept a straight face...<br /><br />Here they are:<br />  * Vin Diesel (\\"The Pacifier\\") is Riddick, the legendary loner who sets his own broken leg (don't ask).<br />  * Karl Urban (\\"RED\\") in a 30-second bait and switch. Do NOT go if you are expecting to see Mr. U. in an actual role...<br />  * Jordi Mollà (\\"Knight and Day\\") is Santana, the bounty hunter. To him, Riddick is worth more dead than alive.<br />  * Matt Nable (\\"Killer Elite\\") is Boss Johns, seeking Riddick to learn more about his son's death.<br /><br />The story? Left for dead on a sun-baked planet, our hero fights against all odds and plots revenge. That pretty much covers it.<br /><br />This has some of the best CGI work I have seen to date, the production design is wonderful, the photography is masterful, the story is basic but involving, and like other Diesel outings, includes an anti-drug bit. On the other hand, the R-rated plot is rudimentary, the comedy is crude, the fight scenes are endless (use your fast-forward on your DVD from Amazon), and one of the monsters eats its own entrails. Fan boys loved the action, while I admired the CGI. Yup, I said it!

140006922X|4.0|I have read other books with theories/ evidence of Jesus and his lost years \\" a search for the historical Jesus\\" by professor Fida Hassnain a sufi and \\"Jesus lived in India' by Holger Kersten and the Aquarian gospel of Christ ( evidence and theories on Jesus in travels to India, Tibet and Persia during his youth and his relations with the Essenes ) and returning to Israel for his ministry which may add yet other views but this author does provide a solid thesis backed with evidence..<br /><br /> however flawed I feel is his constant barking of illiteracy for it seems to me that Jesus had quite the use of parables and orator skills which in my opinion seems to dictate study and a well read man in both spiritual discourse, healing abilities (not magic tricks) as the author implies, and perhaps his radical teachings from studies abroad<br /><br />guess its a choice for those which evidence to believe, son of God, zealot or adept yogi<br />whatever truth people deem fit and that's why Jesus is so interesting for those with open minds<br /><br />would really love to hear what aslan thinks of these other theories
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I'm a fan of the X Man series and this one was well done.  The cast is excellent; the plot Ok but interesting.  The CG effects are outstanding.  The producers managed to get B+ actors who performed with enthusiasm yet didn't take themselves too seriously.<br />Worth a look

B0074VA2T2|5.0|Amazing App ! She's 2 1/2 and already knew her numbers so that probably makes playing this game even more fun for her but she absolutely loves it. Second day out, we were on level four. She's sincerely challenged but not put off. She likes to tell the game that she doesn't like to eat what they tell her eat, she'll want to eat the ice cream or lollipop. It's the funniest thing. We've only played a few days but I look forward to many, many happy fun times ahead. The game builds them in their number comprehension in a fun way. I love it and I think kids would. It helps to if they love Eric Carle books and she does.

B00ECR7KX2|4.0|David Bevington has noted that the three great romantic comedies of 1599, Much Ado, What You Will(or Twelfth Night) and As You Like It, all have titles which suggest a certain off-handedness. In his greatest comedies as nowhere else Shakespeare seems to enjoy his gifts and declines to take himself too seriously. Accordingly it was very much in the spirit of things when Whedon decided to gather with friends and frequent collaborators to shoot a film of Much Ado in his home, in two weeks for as little money as possible. The result is an airy, charming, whisp of a film which gives pleasure every second it occipies the screen.<br /><br />Taking place in Whedon's modern home, where characters gather over wine in the kitchen or in the garden, proceedings take on a domestic feeling in which even the larger scenes feel relatively intimate. The masque, for instance, becomes a kind of casual dinner party which fashionable people might attend. The Duke's visit feels like a meeting between friends, nothing to do with affairs of state. In Whedon's hands Shakespeare's nobles become leisured bourgoisie and the more political aspects of the play are often downplayed while the focus goes to the personal relationships between the characters. The lighting and black and white cinematography are understated and excellent.<br /><br />The leads are uniformly strong but there are no revelations. Whedon has encouraged broad, physical acting, with a good deal of physical comedy. Often he keeps his actors moving; Benedick jogs athrough the garden or chases Beatrice down the stairs; Beatrice shuffles accross the room on hands and feet to escape detection as she eavesdrops. In this way Whedon maintains a certain rhythm and level of energy but it at times overwhelmes the text. The actors manage the verse well but with relatively few insights into the lines. Whedon's boldest and most successful decision was to change Conrad's gender. She and Don John engage in uncommitted and meaningless sexsuality which colors their scheme to ruin the pure love of Claudio and Hero. For Whedon they stand with many other of Shakespeare's characters (notably Iago and Lucio) who jealously wish to drag those around them into their own degraded view of love and sex. This dynamic proves incredibly compelling and insightful. Just as successful is Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. Overstuffed into a badly fitted suit and obnoxiously proud of his modest authority, he will become that security gaurd you hated at that building you worked-at/lived-in while at the same time remaining likable through his obvious earnestness. His brilliant understatemnt and timing find every laugh.<br /><br />While the cast and director do not find depths of the barely averted tragedy or the lyrical hights of the characters unearned forgiveness and reconcilement, it remains full of good feeling and some genuine insight. Given the dearth of adaptatons of Shakespeare's comedies, this is more than enough reason to treasure it.ty which colors their scheme to ruin the pure love of Claudio and Hero.

B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband and I love this show and have now started watching season 2 on Amazon Prime.  Season 2 is shaping up to be very good.

0446310786|5.0|I love this book, would recommend it to everybody. I'm going to read it again to get the most of it. Sorry the author didn't publish anymore books.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Three big disappointments:<br />1) It didn't work with the Samsung PN60F8500. If someone else got it to work with that TV, please comment, or even if you had the same problem, I'd love to know. I got it to work with 3 other Samsung TVs, one of which was a 2013 model (UN40F5500). The other 2 TVs are older 2008 models, and the Chromecast works on those too.<br /><br />2) Doesn't work in hotels. With the sign-on page needed to access hotel internet, Chromecast does not have an option to login in through those pages. It seems like the brilliant programmers at Google would have an easy software fix. Or here's an idea, add Google Chrome to Chromecast natively so that it can open the page and stream content directly from world wide web. You control it on your computer like you would for Netflix or Youtube, but instead, you're sending web addresses to the Chromecast to display. Unlike Tab Sharing (sit tight, you're up next) which tries to stream from the computer you're on as a screen share. If you just were able to hit the chromecast button and type in the address to open natively, all would be solved. I think... Just do it.<br /><br />3) When I saw you could share tabs from Chrome, I got excited. It's what made me buy the Chromecast. I can already get Netflix and YouTube through other devices, so that wasn't a big deal (however, they are nice features, and I'll discuss below). What I didn't know when I bought the Chromecast was that this feature is still in beta... I'm all for being a beta tester, and have done my far share in the past. Unfortunately, in this case, I was a bit blind-sided until reading that the feature was in beta at some point during the set-up. I think we're also in a very very early stage of the beta because I've yet to have a tab sent to Chromecast that would last more than 30 seconds. So forget trying to stream a video or other content from one of your tabs (that isn't Netflix or YouTube). I really hope that Google improves this feature. Perhaps my suggestion above for a native Chrome app controlled on your computer would do the trick. Just a thought.<br /><br />Three positives, and why I'm holding on to the Chromecast:<br />1) It's very easy to use the Netflix and YouTube applications. Just hit a button and it's on the screen. I ended up putting the Chromecast on an older TV that still gets use, but doesn't have other video streaming capabilities. So $35 to get Netflix on the TV was a great add-on. I can use my phone or computer to tell the Chromecast what to play.<br /><br />2) Small - The TV it's hooked into is mounted on the wall. No boxes or cables are seen, everything in the wall, a very clean look. With the Chromecast, it's able to stay connected to the TV, doesn't show, and doesn't compromise the look of the TV on my wall.<br /><br />3) Hope for the future - More apps are coming. Developers are programming for the Chromecast now. Maybe we'll start to see more of what we see from the usual Roku boxes, built-in TV Apps, etc. I'm also hoping for the Chrome Tab share to get better. As the device improves, I think I'll be happier with the purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/7/2013:<br />I want to add that I have been able to connect the Google Chromecast to an HDMI port on my AV Receiver (Pioneer Elite SC-05). I have an HDMI out to my TV. No problems with this connection, works as normal. Wanted to add this just in case someone was looking to connect it through a receiver instead of directly to a TV.<br /><br />Also, if you don't find this review helpful, please leave a comment as to why, or ask a question that I can help you with. I'm a little curious why I quickly received 3 \\"not helpful\\" clicks vs. 1 \\"helpful\\" after posting my initial review which I posted solely to help others...
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The story had me very interested, but there are a few large plot holes and amazing coincidences that make this one just ok.
B00CEF014E|5.0|A dark little mystery with lots of good twists. Smart plotting and compelling characters. I especially liked the first half when we aren't sure what's going on. Very well done.
B000ZP813S|5.0|I never thought these shoes were as comfortable as they are. I wish I could wear them all the time!
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|This video is in English but comes in other languages such as Greek, Polish and about 5 others.  I am trying to teach my kids Greek and Spanish, so that is a bonus!
B0025KVLTW|5.0|What can I say about classic BEATLES ?  The Magic Mystery Tour is trying to take you away !!!<br /><br />V
B0013F1D02|5.0|The movie is the same thing that is out of the box! Ordered it for my girlfriend that lives couple hours away, and she got it and watched it with ease! Quality video, audio, and didn't &#34;Buffer&#34; Once. Thanks Amazon!
B00377V6J2|5.0|One cannot beat the excellence of these players.  Too bad they<br />are with us no longer.  Stevie Ray was awesome and so was Albert<br />King.  Love these guys.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Maroon 5 is such a talented band its my favorite group to listen to when im taking  a long ride in the car
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I have not yet learned how to use this app or ignore it either as it keeps coming up on my tablet when I don't ask for it. I may have to remove it soon as it does annoy me. The 5 stars are because it looks as if it will work well for some folks.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|I feel these reviews should be based on product quality, not how good the movie was (Wasn't to bad, followed the book nicely). There were not any serious issues, and the movie and audio quality were just as they said it would be. It is not the same as watching it on bluray, because it is an older movie, but there was not one moment where the 480/720p movie disturbed me. It fit.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon aren't usually on my list of favorite actors that I must see. BUT. I enjoyed their performances in 'The Departed' . They performed well in this talented ensemble grouping with Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and others.  I found their character portrayals believable, and the story-line's similarity to the real life Whitey Bulger case , in Boston, is truly interesting.<br />I know I'll watch this movie again, and again.
1451662432|5.0|This book is really good.  It is amazing to see someone set such high goals in life and work their butt off to succeed.  This story<br />is so interesting.  I couldn't stop reading it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series!!!! Martin is definitely not afraid to kill off characters, no names! He sure knows how to keep you on your toes!
B008469DGY|5.0|I'm not a golf fan, but I decided to give this a try. Very well done game. Nice graphics, good physics and pleasant sound. Took a bit of playing to get the hang of distance and guiding the ball, but after a couple of games I got it and I'm liking this. Great FAOTD Amazon!  Great game devs!
B000646L94|5.0|It is a very moving story. This film is NON FICTION this is because of the excellent cast selection .<br />I know this is factual because I lived in Mississippi (and still do). Since I was born in 1956, I can recall some things like the time my mum went into this small store (like a C Store ) and she said this sign said KKK meeting here TONIGHT.Needless to say she did her business and quickly left.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like this game the story line is a lot of fun and interesting the manning tiles are bright and easy to read I think you would like to play to
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game!  It's challenging and fun.  It is for all levels of players and will keep you entertained.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is very challenging and I try to always get all of them and go as far as I can.  I am addicted to this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi I'm am Alfred's son and this game is awesome I play it everyday<br />to get the dailys jut until I get my own device but I like how it's challenging<br />and easy at same time. I like the challenges but once in a while I skip em<br />and that jet pack that brings you up and get lots of coins and a good<br />amount of distance well that's it for now seeya and thanx for the game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just can't Seem to get enough of this game. Love to play this every chance I get day and night. ,Can't wait until I get more coins.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love working my mind out. Makes me think. Which gets me way addicted. Can't wait for more rooms. Hurry and try to stumped me!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book.  It was thought provoking, and at the same time very emotional.  The character studies were all very believable and realistic.  I was never sure how the book would end and that kept me quite on edge and anxious to keep reading.  A beautiful study of a difficult situation.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent book.  Just would have liked move information at end of &#34;Freed&#34; about the baby and Christians thoughts. Well written!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|terrific show. I am looking forward to the new season this year! I hope you have season seven as soon as it comes out!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I dont care about comics. As far as a movie? This was great. It makes me forget that stinker Iron Man 2. Good action, great camera angles, great characters. I enjoyed the madarin twist even though it was against the grain. Guy did a great job of being a villian. It was like getting part comic book, part video game, and part Lethal Weapon. The level of action and the pace of the movie was right on target. The pepper ending could have been a silly disaster but i think they did it right, and gwen played that scene perfect. I left the theatre very happy. Like spider man 2, avengers, x men 2, this is a great marvel action movie. Not a comic book. Shane Black did a great job with this movie. It was like being in the theatre as a kid watching the Hoth battle unfold. Thats how i feel about this movie. Can you tell i just watched it? Im going to watch it again right now.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|i travel a lot and like to see what hotels are available, and what others think about the place.  i have found that some reviews are dead on, and others, are way off
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great app. Takes a while to download videos but it does what it is meant for. I recommend this app .
B00A2WM4XW|5.0|When this movie was made. Combining the horror with action. Great story, great characters. Its outdated but its like star wars where the movie itself is so much of a character that you dont notice. Its the sets, the actiing, and the flow of this movie that puts it in a class with raiders and empire.
1905236042|5.0|My 4yo daughter recently started doing yoga at daycare. Her teacher told me she really responded to it and the cards she used, so I decided to get some cards for her to have at home. I ordered the 'yoga pretzels' cards as they were large in size and had easy directions for each pose. My daughter loves them! She spreads them around her yoga mat and performs each pose. Some cards have poses with partners so we can do them together. The cards are colourful and separated into groups (ie breathing, balance, twist & stretch). There's a beautiful illustration on the front of each card and easy to understand instructions on the back. I highly recommend them.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I am unable to download Candy Crush, says unavailable at this time, I really want it downloaded too. Please help
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Move over Hawke here come Khaleb.  Really loved this book must have re-read about 10 times already since it came out.
B00407PNY2|3.0|Bad side of 70's film making. Long boring scenes of actors doing mundane chores, and too much time spent setting up a simplistic plot. Not much action for an &#34;action&#34; movie. The car chase is everything it's hyped to be, though.
1400052173|4.0|What a story!  Fascinating stuff.  Brings up questions about who owns my body parts and what happens to them.  Great story - and  it's true!
B008B3MZMY|5.0|Considering the age of the film, this is an outstanding performance professionally captured and professionally restored. What a great band of writers and performers that flamed out too quick. Nice work ramming this through the sniping and filibustering former members and getting it to the public.<br /><br />Trivia: Bob Seidenbreg (?), the drummer, is the brother in law of Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am enjoy the production.The production it classic,speciallyof the english and the american manner.I love maggie Smith very much.she fine actress.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game takes patience because sometimes you die but it is supper cool you should buy it when you have the chance it is so Awesome and their getting more updates
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I had seen the commercials for this movie and thought it looked stupid. It looked like a boring Star Wars wannabe. I had no idea what it was really about. I didn't know it was based on an old book, much older than Star Wars. I didn't know a thing about it. I just knew in the commercials it looked incredibly boring, and like a poorly done Star Wars wannabe.<br /><br />I ended up seeing it in a dollar theater when I literally had nothing else to do.I was skeptical about even spending the $1.00 on the ticket, but it was the only movie that started at that time and I had to kill a few hours.<br /><br />I was surprised at how good the movie actually was! In fact, I was kicking myself for waiting so long to see it. I would have loved to see it in IMAX 3D.<br /><br />I bought the 3D bluray. None of my friends saw it in theater (for the same reasons as my initial concerns). So far, all of the people that have watched it in my home theater have absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Everyone goes in expecting a boring Star Wars wannabe, but they leave wanting more.<br /><br />This is possibly the most under rated film of all time.<br /><br />It was about a year after I had seen it (which was in a dollar theater, long after the initial release) when I learned this was based on a book from the 50s (correction, it was published in 1912, thanks S. Parrish), long before Star Wars was written. This isn't a Star Wars wannabe, but it likely helped to inspire the Star Wars story. And I'm sorry to all the hard core Star Wars fans, but this is even better, in my opinion.<br /><br />I highly encourage everyone to see this movie. You will almost certainly be left wanting more.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|it is fine a game. there are not fifteenth levels there. are not different. tasks but the candes are tasty in looking
B007TK77QE|5.0|What a good read!! The setting and characterisation of a small rural village and it's people are great. The story includes humour, drama and a wide variety of characters to make it more than interesting.
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|My kids loved this movie.  They are 2 and 4 and were glued to the screen.  My husband and I love it when we put in a movie and the kids sit quietly and watch the whole thing!<br />I grew up watching the original Smurf cartoons and had a number of the figurines.  I was entertained and enjoyed this movie as well.  I look forward to purchasing the sequel.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|This is such a lame story/movie that Karl Urban wouldn't even take his helmet off - the entire movie. Not to mention the depiction of the future is seriously depressing.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Fast paced, non stop.  The series is getting a bit &#34;tried&#34; however.<br />Much of the action sequence (in line with the series) is a bit far fetched,<br />but that has always been true for this series.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Makes my new smartphone worthwhile<br />Visuals are awesome, soun*4dTrack is diverse and well orchestrated .  I'm only level 13. Have to see what comes next.<br /><br />.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is wonderful and should not be missed.  Beside the great script and acting it is a wonderful backdrop for historical events and how people adjusted to a new world after world war one.<br />not to be missed!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This headphone is harsh at first.<br />But soon, my ears adjusted, and I can hear everything.<br />I have been studying violin for almost ten years now, and I must say the sound reproduction by these headphones is outstanding. It is very accurate.<br />The level of detail this headphone is able to reproduce is simply the best. It makes me pay attention. I don't want to stop the music once it began because all the music are now so much more interesting than before.<br />The bass is perfectly balanced. Mids perfectly balanced. highs crystal clear.<br /><br />This headphone is good for listening to anything be it classical or non-classical. Just make sure you have a good source file.<br /><br />I was skeptical at first, but it really does feel like I'm on the stage of a classical performance, being able to hear all the detail.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I liked the way the story weaves together many lives and cultures and gives a global view of WWI.  I think the author, in his telling of this story, clearly expresses the waste and horror of war, and at the same time shows us the resilience of the human spirit.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I actually &#34;LOL'd&#34; in a few spots.  There were parts where i felt like skipping pages because it was dragging on.  Overall, a good read and I'll be looking for more books by John Green.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I read all the reviews panning the explicit lyrics and I'm just amazed.  Have you never heard curses before?  I don't think saying the f-word twice in the course of 10 tracks is very offensive at all.  As far as the lyrics being sexual, this guy is a grown man and he makes music for everyone.  He is not writing his lyrics to cater to those who are of Sesame Street age.  Furthermore, the overtly religious reviewers need to calm down.  He is not a religious artist and he doesn't need to cater to you either.  If you walk down a city street you will hear far worse and I bet you say much worse yourselves in your private moments. Every single track on this record could be a hit.  From the gorgeous simplicity of \\"When I Was Your Man\\", to the deep grooves of \\"Gorilla\\" and \\"Natalie\\", there is something for everyone.  I love the fact that he went old-school on \\"If I Knew\\" to close the album.  What a brilliant old-school soul song.  This man is a genius as well as a master-class vocalist and songwriter.  For me, Bruno Mars is the musical messiah and this album is a blessing of the highest order.  Do yourself and get the Target-exclusive deluxe edition which has acoustic demos of \\"Gorilla\\" and \\"Young Girls\\".  It also has a couple killer remixes.  It's simply essential.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved \\"Entwined With You\\" as much as I loved the prior two books in the series.  I couldn't give a 5 star review because I felt there was very little left hanging in Eva and Gideon's story ... no cliffhanger or suspenseful ending.  I don't want to leave any spoilers so I will leave my review at this ... THIS IS A MUST READ for anyone that loves a good romance/erotica story.  It's super steamy!
B00006LLLN|3.0|I received this CD in a very timely manner and the case was in excellent shape. It's a two CD set and on playing the 2nd CD, I noticed that it couldn't play through after the 2nd or 3rd song. It had a small scratch on it and I would have to forward the CD a couple songs to get it to play. I contacted the seller though and he said that I could return it, which is what I plan to do soon.

B00AO3K01C|5.0|I loved this story and its interweaving of two different worlds in Japan and North America. The author's narrative voice reads as pure and unflinching. It's a haunting story, engaging sincerely with the value of working, however imperfectly, towards alchemizing suffering into wisdom and lucidity.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|i think the complete album progression from big time rush a very good album. Has a combination of slow, fast, and dance songs not one song will be skipped. Thanks for putting out a great album guys

B00DPY95D6|5.0|This book is an amazing read. I really enjoyed the action and drama of this book. What I loved about it the most is that the story-line moves along with many surprises and twist, keeping you glued to every page. Cheryl, the main character thought she was dealing with a simple court case, but she ended up being immersed in a world that really took her through some strange experiences. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something unique and exciting!

1481130331|5.0|THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS  BY CHRISTOPH FISCHER<br /><br />What a brilliant book this is - it has it all, history, romance, suspense and more.  Human nature in all it's forms.<br />Beginning in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia in 1933 and through to 1945 with all that happens in between, this is an absolute must read.  The extensive research done by the author is evident as the story unfolds.<br /><br />From the start of this story when Greta Weissensteiner meets and falls in love with Wilhelm Winkelmeier in the bookshop where Wilhelm works, we are gently led into an epic journey through the war years and beyond. It is an education in life at that time and includes many fascinating, and to me at least, previously unknown circumstances.<br /><br />The different characters lives and how they intertwine with each other draws the reader in, not letting you go until the last page, and even then it stays in your mind.<br /><br />Read how Greta deals with all that life throws at her during that time in history and the aftermath of war.  Get angry and frustrated on her behalf as she struggles to cope at times.  Is Wilhelm really the gentle, serious young man who falls in love with Greta?<br /><br />Find out what happens to Greta's father, the weaver of fine carpets.  Will he be able to continue to hide the fact that he is a Jew?  What happens when he meets the Countess, how will she affect his life?  What about Greta's sister Wilma and her brother Egon, how do they cope with this changing world?<br /><br />There are too many characters involved for me to mention here.  You must meet them  yourself on this journey through history.<br />Marvel at the resilience of some, be annoyed at the weakness of others.<br />Feel the terror that grips many.  Be happy when good things happen.<br /><br />The author does a great job in explaining events during this time, opening my eyes to previously unknown things, especially when this war was over.<br /><br />I found I was getting up earlier and staying up later to read!  I simply did not want to stop.  This book just has to be read, I strongly recommend it.  It fully deserves five star status.er and staying up later to read!  I simply did not want to stop.

I lost one and the other was a cassette tape( long time ago) But I really like this album so i decided to purchase it again when it went on sale and it had the MP3 option to it.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful plot line and character development. I was upset with the season three finale though. Did not like that ending.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Always good to go back to see Angelina Jolie in action movie.  We don't have much of this India Jone type any more.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I'm not a big fan of biographies, but this was excellent. I learned so much about Jobs, Apple, and the Apple's closed concept. For me, it was a page turner.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie was mildly entertaining at best.  I fell asleep, so, I don't know, maybe it was a great movie!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I haven't had to use it very often, but when I do, it's very easy to use and very user friendly!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the show!  It is easy to watch and entertaining story lines. It is great to have the shows ready to view so I can watch as many (or as little) episodes as I want.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|I love this product.  We took pictures of my dog during her birthday party.  The pictures came out beautifully.  Looking forward to taking more pictures.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is such an amazing book!  Loved every page.  I can't say enough about this book.  It had me hooked from cover-to-cover.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most realistic game ever. It awesome it is just like having your own real horse. There's a lot of stuff to choose from.
B008469DGY|4.0|This is a good game. It jas good play, but not exactly golf. Still fun to play. I would recommend.
B000I8H7RI|5.0|Still a scary movie after all of these years.  Watched it as a senior in high school..........Many years ago.  Now sending to granddaughters who are freshmen this year.
B007L96SI6|5.0|This is a wonderful first album. It is exactly what I wanted to hear from Haley. I look forward to her music as she evolves and matures. She has the unique voice and the chops to take her places.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|okay my  3 year old grand son likes  more educational movies but he watched this one and had alot  ot  fun,
B005FDW7AI|2.0|The acting in this movie, mostly by children, was way to stagy for me. I couldn't take it.  I think the kids in the Annie Broadway show were more subtle.
B0049J3QNG|3.0|there are some parts of the move a little scary for my 3 year old grand son, he liked the first one but not this one or the 3rd
0425267695|5.0|This is a sweeping epic that kept me engrossed from start to finish.  The comprehensive writing by Anthony Ryan was excellent and I am so pleased it will be a trilogy.  This book starts out with the main character telling his story to an enemy historian who has been sent to chronicle his life story.<br /><br />Vaeline, a ten year old boy is indentured to walk in his fathers steps and become, \\"The Sword of the King\\". His father takes him to the Sixth Order and explains that this will be his life's path and that the Order will be his only family.  Throughout his apprenticeship he surprisingly, retains an admirable moral compass that was instilled in him by his Mother, and rarely seen in the Sixth Order.<br /><br />Once he is old enough to become, \\"The Sword of the King\\", Vaeline unfortunately, discovers that unlike himself, the King does not walk the same ethical path.  The tasks that he is commissioned by the King to perform, are quite Machiavellian and  put him continually in very jeopardizing situations.  The Princess Lyrna and Vaeline somehow become unlikely cohorts and endeavor to preserve some semblance of honor for the Royal family.  They are also are trying to uncover the dark secrets that may be behind the possible existence of a dissolved, mystical, Seventh Order that they hope will reveal more information about Vaelines, newly discovered, magical gift.<br /><br />A perfect mix of a great author and a wonderful narrator. Steven Brand's voice is very smooth and expressive. I hope he returns for the next books.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Really liked the puzzles.  Finding the hidden objects was great fun.  When I completed the game I was disappointed cause I wanted to keep going.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm 7 I LOVE the game  WALT Disney Picture's presents that I am not 7 I am 10 going on to 11 and way LOVE the game.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I play it at night while my husband watches all the reruns. Helps relax me before going to bed at night.
B005LAII4E|3.0|The movie was a pretty good action flick, but I think the first GI Joe was better than this one.
3899554914|5.0|You can spend hours pouring over the interesting photos of these bikes. They are works of art! Great gift for a biker...
B0019M068O|4.0|A must have if you are an ABBA fan and already have the first Gold Hits album, this would definitely be a great addition.
B008Q07GLW|5.0|Showed it to the kids aged 7 and 10. theres violence and i made  them  cover their eyes for those scenes. But an enjoyable movie for all.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|This was a good movie, however, I thought it was a little too short.  I guess I am too used to the pervious Die Hard movies.
0316098337|4.0|I read this book earlier this year.  It was so disturbing - and felt a bit unreal.  And then three women were freed from longterm captivity in one home in Cleveland, with one of the young women having raised a child fathered by the captor. Reading the book NOW would provide a whole new perspective - I'm giving it 4 stars now, would only have given it 3 prior to the Cleveland event.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I can see why this movie was nominated for so many awards, this is a must see and a great collection addition.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I got into this book right away!  A great page turner for all women!  Will look into other books by this author!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but it is addictive. There's new things to discover in every room and the fun part is putting the pieces together.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't recommend this series highly enough. The characters are beauitfully developed, and the plot is rich. A great illustration of British aristocracy in the early 1900's.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved this game! My son really enjoys Despicable Me and had fun playing this game as well. They incorporated games like Temple Run and Subway surfers with minions. Thumbs up!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This item was oringinally purchased to help charge a kindle that was unable to be charged. So in that respect it did not accomplish what it was purchased to do. After using this cable on my new Kindle Fire, it doesn't seem to charge that much more quickly than the regular charger. I will continue to moniter its speed.The length of the wire does make charging while the Kindle is in use, less cumbersome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nomater what you do you always have something to do. It is so fun for one I like it alot
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very similar to GI's Mystery Manor but with much better graphics. It's a very addicting game and I agree with other reviews stating to be patient. So far I've noticed that the game play in this game is much longer than the competitor's game. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games with a variety of mini puzzles.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I 've played all the way through three times now and it's just as much fun as when I first bought it!! Love love love this game!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|WELL DONE..RIVETING...NEXT EPISODE GREATLY ANTICIPATED. THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A SCENARIO CREDIBLE.<br /><br /> BETTER THAN WHAT HOLLYWOOD ATTEMPTS FOR THEATER GOERS.<br /><br />THE FUTURE OF VISUAL ENTERTAINMENT,
0896762629|5.0|I love Janet Arnold and all her books.  They are wonderfully written and the patterns are fantastic and (from what I've made) relatively easy to follow.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Wonderful book.  One that makes you happy as you read.  Once again proves America's love for all things  British.  I love a book that makes me laugh.
0896760278|5.0|I love Janet Arnold and all her books.  They are wonderfully written and the patterns are fantastic and (from what I've made) relatively easy to follow.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|As I watched World War Z, I couldn't help but feel it was all very familiar. And then it hit me. If you replace the zombies with birds then you realize that structurally and thematically World War Z is essentially a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. It was passably enjoyable but nothing worth a second viewing.
B0041B4B8G|5.0|Not sure if it was because the first time I saw this I was actually in San Diego and watching it on an old CRT hotel TV decorated like it could still be the 1970's but this instantly because my favorite movie ever. The laugh density far surpasses any other comedy I can think of. I was never really a will Ferrell fan before this. I think about his time on SNL playing that cheer leader I literally changed the channel. He's not like that at all in Anchorman. He's much closer to fake Alex Trebek on Celebrity Jeopardy, which is to say, Awesome.
B004MPR80E|5.0|I read this book while on holiday, and while you might think from the subject matter that it would be heavy duty and depressing, I actually found it incredibly absorbing and strangely life-affirming.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This story is achingly beautiful. The writing is snappy and fun to read. This book has stayed with me and I have shared it with many friends.
B00B125QRS|5.0|This no frills attached box set is awesome!  The sound quality is top notch & it captures Van Halen at the bands most energetic & exciting time! I am really getting tired of hearing people complain about the lack of this & there should have been that !! The product review tells you exactly what your getting & for the price you should be glad your getting it at all ! This is the first & quite possibly the best incarnation of Van Halen. Don't get me wrong I loved Sammy Hagar with Montrose & I loved him on his own & I loved what he was allowed to do with the Van Halen Brother's. David Lee Roth must have gotten as much air time as Van Halen's front man as Michael Jordan did playing basketball, LOL!  This is a awesome box set covering the bands first incarnation & the sound quality is great !!!  The product review is accurate & shows you what you get & if you grew up amazed hearing their debut album & eagerly awaited the album's that followed than this box set is for you & at this price I wouldn't hesitate. A great way to update your C.D.'s without going broke! Van Halen hit the ground running with &#34;Diamond Dave&#34; & wrapped up their time together with a smash hit album in 1984. I would love to see a box set as cheap if not cheaper of the Sammy year's ! And what happened to Gary Charone from Exrtreme I thought he was going to front Van Halen... He must of had an idea & got fired!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Wonderful read.  I think I actually enjoyed it more than the Davinci Code.  Couldn't wait to read it every day.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Loved the movie. It was a one-man buddy movie. Lot of clever banter; moved right along; great crime solver. Very entertaining. I'd like to see a sequel!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Great show. Very clean and family friendly! I just fell in love instantly and had to watch all 3 seasons.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wonderful workout
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The photos really help in telling this tale. I loved reading it. Almost could not put it down and ready for the next one!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As I sit here dealing with my aged parents in a town I have not lived in for forty plus years this resonates with me.  Although I think  some areas were a little too  long in the descriptions.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy this app a lot. I don't see any ads like some people are saying. It's a little different than normal mahjong but very addicting and enjoyable.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Very well told story!  If you like military movies, you will appreciate this one very much!  This movie had several very memorable scenes, and you will be blown away!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is a fun game to play but....some of the items that are being built take waaaaaaaaaay to long to build and the game starts to get boring.
B003FFEX8C|4.0|A great romp and Halle Berry is a lot of fun to watch.  She was super!  Nice relaxing movie treat.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I still have not quit thinking about this book and when I am doing things I remember about how blessed we truly are and our country ignores the lessons of history.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Works perfect, very intuitive.  The best part is the easy integration with my other calendars. Now I only have one calendar to use and update.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This app can be fun but it has the occasional glitch that won't allow you to attack someone who has attacked you
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Every time I go to join a game that I have been invited to the game crashes and the invite disappears. My friends cannot get invites from me no matter how many times I send them.<br />I haven't even been able to play this game yet because it doesn't work!<br /><br />Playing on Kindle Fire HD.
B00E1LAS42|4.0|The movie was amazing.  However the online movie play refused to play HD quality on my HD tv (through my computer) forcing me to download Unbox to get that quality.  A forced quality button be much apreciated
B009KY0VF6|4.0|Great performance and excellent quality sound with the Shadows.  However,  I expected to hear more songs in The Young Ones movies.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|I loaded Mobo directly to my Kindle HD Fire without additional codecs or files. Then I copied sample mov, wmv, avi and mp4 files to test it. The wmv, avi and mp4 files played pretty well, although the lack of player controls during playback is disturbing. The wmv and avi files were basically playing back in black and white with some splashes of rainbow colors in static spots on the screen. If I was watching a movie I loved, this would be disturbing. The strangest thing happened in playing the mov files (all created with iPhone4): The files played in slow motion, with the audio playing normally (so the audio finished playing back halfway through each clip). While the action was interesting, I could see that Mobo is probably not as well supported in Android as in other systems. Perhaps, also, I should only be playing mp4 files; commercial movies.
B003KUSUN6|5.0|Great-Excellent quality.<br />Great performance, excellent sound and pictures quality from the beginning 'till the end. Hope they will do The Last Final Tour.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I love this book. If you watch castle on tv you can almost see castle and Beckett in the book. That is why I gave it 5 stars. Love Richard Castle and not to mention the TV show.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|The movie, functionally, did everything that I was expecting. The movie played through its entire duration and paused when I paused it. If you want a content review, you're in the wrong place.
B0035V35P8|5.0|I love how determined the actor is in this movie. The movie has opened my eyes to the korean culture. That they will not be disappointed. I have no other film to compare, the was awesome.
B00821OW8K|5.0|THE SHOW IS EXCELLENT AND HOOKED ME ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHICH HAS NOW LED TO FRUSTRATION AND ANGER WITH AMAZON PRIME.WHAT NERVE AMAZON HAS TO START CHARGING FOR SEASON 3 AFTER TEASING ME FOR TWO SEASONS. THEY SHOULD EITHER REMOVE THE SERIES FROM PRIME OR CHARGE FOR ALL SEASONS. THIS IS A LOW BROW MOVE ON THEIR PART.
B0045HCIYA|4.0|This is a very funny movie with a pretty good story. Burt Reynolds is pretty funny with Vaseline all over him. Demi Moore has a great body!  If you are looking for a funny movie with a little nudity I would recommend this to you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is a whole lot better than most free game and the one you pay for, the game is good even though I suck at it it's fun to play challenge your scores and friends owns. Could get very addictive too I must say even though I still suck at it, I would have giving the full 5starts but am not good with it lol.
B00DOQK2OG|5.0|I make no bones about it.  I love Rainbow!!  Every incarnation.  From the Dio years to Doogie White.  Sure, we know Mr. Blackmore changed band members faster than some changed their own underwear.  And we know ALL the stories of the famous (or infamous) attitudes and opinions.  But, you have to admit that Ritchie could build a great band and bring to the forefront some real great unknown musicians.  I believe Doogie White had to fill some LARGE shoes when Ritchie put the band back together in the early/mid nineties.  He also did it when the grunge scene was in full swing.  &#34;Stranger In Us All&#34; didn't seem to have the support the label should have put behind it.  But, the critics had their say and it's too bad they won.  This CD shows us this Rainbow was running on all 8 cylinders and it shows Ritchie was not going down without a fight.  The music is tight, the vocals are spot-on even if they did need to drop the key down 2 or 3 steps on a couple of tunes.  Ritchie's playing is articulate and up-to-par and the explosive end-of-show fireworks is gone.  I may need to drop the dime and get the DVD of this show.  I didn't know what to expect when I gave this a listen but all doubt left quickly.  From &#34;Spotlight Kid&#34; to &#34;Smoke On The Water&#34;, Doogie is really the frontman and Ritchie should have felt blessed to have him front this version of Rainbow.  I feel this belongs in every Rainbow fans collection.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Stirred up a lot of emotion for me as I can relate to it growing up on a small farm
B003ITIQ88|5.0|This movie was suggested by a friend. I in turn recommend this to you and your child 6 years and above.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Beautifully written! I've read it 5 times, and enjoy it every time. The whole series is woven together like a tapestry that you want to wrap yourself up in!
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This was free with a camera kit I purchased. Otherwise I'd pass.<br /><br />It's awesome for what it is.<br /><br />Very sufficient padding, long enough to fit a decent camera body and zoom lens. I have a T3i and my largest lens is the canon 55-250mm. That fit without issue. I don't own a longer lens to further test.<br /><br />The hard bottom allows you to site the bag upright and will also help in protecting your equipment should it fall.<br /><br />Quality has been great. It's well built, comfortable and has a pocked to store your memory cards and such.<br /><br />So why wouldn't I pay for it?<br /><br />Maybe I haven't been into photography long enough, but if I'm going to carry a bag that would only fit one camera. I'd rather just carry the camera itself with it's strap.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing ASIN: B001T9N120 for under $8 which allows me to fit my T3i with 18-55mm attached and also store my 55-250mm and 50mm lenses.<br /><br />Everyone has different needs. It's a great case, which is why I gave it 5 stars. It's just not practical for me.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Powerful picture of how the criminal mind works to justify itself and its actions. Very strong writing, gripping drama, eye opening view of the crime syndicate in the '40s.
0525952926|4.0|This book got me hooked on Ken Follett. Can not wait for the next in the series to be released.
B008220AVW|5.0|My daughter loved this movie.  Quick ship.  Some songs are not appropriate for younger eyes - the words seem innocent enough but the video is somewhat suggestive.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I hate commercials but enjoy excellent writing, acting and plots. This show has it all and I highly recommend it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I did a lot of research along with some of my friends and their truly is no better pair of wireless and corded headphones for the money. They are very sturdy with a collapsible design that makes them very durable. I love these for Skype and any other form of chat. The sound quality is amazing and the range is quite good. I can't find anything bad with these.
B00B2166BS|5.0|The cable arrived in a timely manner, the packaging was secure, and it works without a problem.  Indeed, it does seem that it charges the Nexus 10 faster than the regular USB connection which is a plus.  Additionally, it has saved my Nexus 10 from a fall on several occasions as the cord simply releases when abruptly pulled which makes this a necessary purchase for the safety of one’s tablet.  Overall, if you own a Nexus 10, do yourself a favor and purchase this magnetic cable.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great Season! Mike starts to really see what the Big Leagues are like. Louis makes a grave mistake that will come back to bite him next season. Mike and Rachel reach new heights.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|This watch line is now &#34;RED HOT&#34;...You see them on men's wrists everywhere...This is the second Invicta I have and I like both of them...My other Invicta is a Russian Divers watch...Mega heavy and bulky (I like that about it)...This one is slimmer and more luxurious...The savings were tremendous...And here is the Invicta kicker:  BOTH watches get me comments each time I wear them...I have never received so much reaction to any item I have worn in over 64 years!  Want a good watch?  Want a watch with quality?  Want a watch you will love?  Done...Get the Invicta...So glad I did!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Loved watching it over and over.  cant wait for the next season to come out.  this seller will always be on my list to use over and over.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|If you love dinosaurs like me then your doing do love this game. It's very addictive so much you don't want to stop  playing it.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|LDR is simply the best! ... She will soar to the top of the charts with this album.<br />Best music this year...that is all
B000U6BT40|5.0|A little cheesy, with oddball characters, but it works. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which a common problem on TV shows.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I'll admit, the first few times I listened to this album I wasn't very impressed.  Sure it was Ozzy, sure he was back with (most of) the band, but something just didn't feel right.  For some background, the first time I ever listened to Black Sabbath was on vinyl.  My best friend and I would \\"borrow\\" his older brothers records all the time (when he wasn't home of course) and I still vividly remember how awe inspiring it was to hear songs like Iron Man and War Pigs for the first time.  As time went by Ozzy left the band and the newer albums just never held my interest. (I don't intend to start an argument and I certainly respect Dio as a singer and I even liked some of the later songs but for me Black Sabbath didn't feel like Black Sabbath without Ozzy, sorry to those who may disagree.)  So this morning I had my iPod going and didn't have my ear buds with me, just the music coming out of that tinny little speaker, when one of the tracks from this album came on.  For a moment I could ALMOST believe I was back listening to Black Sabbath for the first time on that ancient record player.  So when I got home later I listened to it again, I mean really listened, and I could finally hear it.  Black Sabbath is back and it's good.<br /><br />The only two things I can say probably caused my initial reaction is 1.  This is a new album.  It's not one of the original eight that have spent decades becoming arguably the most influential hard rock/heavy metal albums of all time.  That takes away nothing from what the guys put out on 13 though.  2.  The other reason, and this is the one that's harder to get past for me, is that IMO Rick Rubin overproduced the album.  Instead of doing justice to the bands sound he's used it as an excuse to escalate the loudness war.  The fact that the mix just doesn't feel like Sabbath is the only reason I'm not giving the album five stars.  And it makes me want to give the vinyl version a try to see if sounds \\"right.\\"
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Fun story, neat characters-people you would like to know, and I loved the ending. Really couldn't think of a better way to end such a book.  Main character is someone l could identify with even though I consider myself a technotard.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|A fantastic book that seems hard to put into a movie. Leonardo Dicaprio was wonderful and with the exception of the modern pop, a well directed and edited movie. I would have appreciated it with music more set to the era. The set and places were great.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|This book has everything!  You start from a Harry Potter-esque child-suddenly-whisked-into-a-fantasy-world story, but from there it just grows in leaps and bounds.  I loved the fact that all the characters are rich and real -- no matter how fantastical, they seem like living, breathing characters.<br /><br />The main character Peter reminds me in some ways of the South Park boys -- in that he shows childhood naivete and extreme intelligence in equal bursts, making the story thoroughly readable and enjoyable.<br /><br />The subtitle \\"A Darkened Fairytale\\" is accurate.  It's dark, but not blindingly so.  In fact, that darkness of the story helps illuminate the heart -- and wit -- behind it.
068981528X|5.0|A must read for those who look for a peaceful solution to problems.  All children should hear this message today.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|After diving into a pool in Yosemite National Park, 18-year-old Oria embarks on a life-affirming mythical journey.  She finds herself in a fantasy world where she is queen.  I don't want to give anything away beyond that point, because the world that Ms. Seal creates is incredibly vibrant, compelling, and also REAL and \\"lived in.\\"  It doesn't feel like some generic fantasy universe, but one which could actually exist right under our noses.<br /><br />At once a compelling fantasy, Beyond Bridalveil Fall also delves into Native American mythos, teen angst, romance, and beyond!  Give this one a read!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Their writing and playing showcase their talent as well as the bands. And that's missed by the hyped folks. Great!!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|OUTVIEW is a metaphysical journey told through the lens of fantasy -- and it's extremely compelling.  While many books dealing with broad philosophical concepts get bogged down in the minutiae, Outview is an exception:  The main character Nate guides the audience through the story with a steady hand -- which is surprising given the things going on around him!<br /><br />Every night Nate experiences nightmares (or \\"outviews\\") where he \\"sees\\" other people's deaths.  Talk about a compelling dramatic thrust for a story!  This understandably fractures the walls of Nate's psyche, making him question everything about himself, his past, his life, his family.<br /><br />If you want to go on a journey, pick Outview!
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|No title, no hype, just one of the best voices in music today. Put it on, take a trip, wherever.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|I have a hard time rating this book. Ok, I gave it five stars because I am a Neso/Hole junky, but... If Hole is really dead then this is 3 star book with a terrible ending. If Harry is not dead, then it becomes 4 stars because it is a brilliant porologue for the next HH book. (Still 4 stars because the murder story is a bit not up to the usual high Nesbo standard). But again, I can never give Nesbo less then 5 stars because I am a corrupted Nesbo fan.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Derek is among the best and without the self hype. Susan and Derek compliment each other so beautifully. Need More.
1401938906|3.0|I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend and from looking over some of the higher ratings here. I have rated it a \\"3,\\" for the effort put forth by the author; also, because I can envision it having a place in helping new, especially young, spiritual seekers.<br /><br />To me this book is reminiscent of The Secret.<br /><br />Although I found the idea of experiments appealing, and the lab reports, creative, I've already done similar experiments per other spiritual and self-help writers over time.<br /><br />As a \\"Believer\\" already, I've studied numerous deeper texts, including A Course In Miracles (to which the author briefly refers.) I found the first third of the book to be inspiring, but after that, interest sharply declined. I will pass along my copy to someone who may find this book helpful.<br /><br />If I were able to choose again; I would choose one of the following instead:<br /><br />\\"There's A Spiritual Solution to Every Problem,\\" by Dr. Wayne Dyer;<br /><br />\\"The Nature of Personal Reality,\\" by Jane Roberts<br /><br />\\"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,\\" by Deepak Chopra<br /><br />or one of the books by Joe Vitale, or Jack Canfield<br /><br />A link to my memoir appears below:<br />[[ASIN:1452556385 Braving Time: Finding the Way Back]]
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I am a ginormic Grease fan. I have the VHS tape, and thought it was time to upgrade to a DVD. Happy with my purchase, not expensive, and the DVD works well.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Tons of fun. Good pace all the way to the end. I very much enjoyed it. I will buy Despicable me 2 as well, as soon as it is released.
B007SGM084|5.0|Not your typical Erotica.  Great story line with lots of twists. But,definitely hot!<br />Will keep you going back for more
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|a great book for teenagers who would love the humor but also a love story that will pull at your heart strings
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It got my questions and its perfect for my school math wat are u waiting for stop reading this and buy it I say it works ;D<br /><br />-urs always
B008469DGY|4.0|Great looking game and very smooth, quite disappointed that this is not golf, just target shooting. Would love to see a real golf game with these graphics and performance.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My children loved this kit, now we just need the roof tiles! I recommend buying these if you don't have them yet.
B00E9OGRW8|5.0|Fn pig is also his best track in my opinion.  What separates this album from the others is that it's much darker and deeper, a little more on the house side even, at times.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Why would you rate this movie any less then five? If you do, you are unamerican. Best movie ever made.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game it us worth your space and time it took to download it rocked you should get it thx
B009O2XY12|5.0|I'm the only one playing this, and love it. I will find others to play,<br />hopefully they will accept it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 4 yr old grandson &amp; I played this together.  It was a great bonding experience for us both. Enjoyed our times together.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I don't know how to play this/ no good instruction to follow.<br />If I had more information, I would try!
B007VGXS8M|2.0|The kindle does not respond when the correct item is touched.....which eats up the time clock when the same item has to be repeatedly touched.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I love this more than documents to go. It works perfectly and is easily one of the best office tool available for android lovers. One thing though, please add Microsoft publisher, that would really tap it off, or something to create brochures. Anyway it is a useful tool
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits Season 2 is well deserving of five stars.  Suits is one of the best cast shows on television.  Enjoyable is an understatement.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|I really love this app but SOOOO MANY GLITCHES!! It puts random pictures from other people on my profile. It also blocks some of the people I follow!! And sometimes when I try to upload something it'll say ''something went wrong'' PLEASE FIX THIS!!!
0061339202|5.0|Once many of the bigger life decisions are made, for many there remains a &#34;what else?&#34; itch.  This book takes a quantitative approach to systematically finding contentment.  The answers are surprisingly easy, if not intuitive in retrospect - the best ones often are - and Csikszentmihalyi's writing style makes very consumable.  Best book I've read this year, partly as it touches on so many other things.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid. My daughter auditioned to be in a Mary Poppins musical, so we watched it before her rehearsals. Its a great movie for all ages. Lots of music, dancing, imagination, choreography. 5 stars :)
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|If you want a great tribute to the<br />greatest singer of our time this<br />is the one you should buy.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|So worth buying the last season! Great quality and sound. Also, not too expensive and the last season is amazing! Buy it
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Enjoyable movie. Good innocent fun. Good characters and great voice actors. Love the walking eggs that cone with it. Good bit of fun
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The programmable sleep timer allows you to set up a relaxing playlist of soothing, sleep inducing music to drift off to, which will help on restless nights.    Over a year later, I would give it another star if it didn't already have five. It is my go-to app for going to sleep or for waking up. I tried a different but similar app on my other tablet, only because i wanted to try a clock with green light instead of blue for a change, and the first time i used the alarm was a horrible disaster - the music was obnoxious and there was no obvious way to shut it off - i wound up deleting the app just to get rid of the noise. THIS on the other hand has a variety of wake-up tones to choose from and start out gently, increasing in volume gradually to encourage you to deal with it - the OFF and the SNOOZE options are quite obvious and at opposite sides of the screen, and OFF is red and SNOOZE is white, so it would be very hard to mistake one for the other. You can set your own play list for sleep-inducing music and set it very precisely for how long to play. I love this app - I would give it another five stars.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Excellent book, excellent delivery service.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys &#34;Beach Books!&#34;  I would recommend this dealer to all those who require excellent service!
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Of course you cannot improve upon the movie itself! But watching it in blu-ray is great! Glad I purchased it,
1936608898|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations.  It is very educational and interesting.  It gave me a different perspective on how the human body works.
B000002KB8|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out. I'd never heard of them but liked the jacket.<br /><br />This recording still stands the test of time. And, yes, it did launch Heavy Metal and all its derivatives.
B003U51D58|5.0|My wife and I love this series.  We were sad when it ended and have yet to find another series we like as much.
1781162646|5.0|I am a huge King fan, and this did not disappoint me at all. I will be recommending to my friends
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I love this music.  Played it over and over while anticipating experiencing Paul live at Outside Lands and it always sounds good!
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|Rachel McAdams is a great actress.. but seeing her as 'the woman in charge' was by far her least effectve roll to date. This was worse then the film Morning Glory, and that was just an awful take on the devil wears prada... it felt like they asked to her to play her mean girl character all grown up. I paid $7 for this too.
B006S086AM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie in the middle of the night.  It is funny but also a good inspiring drama that is not over-the-top but more real although it includes many cliché characters.
B004BDJS9Q|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at this movie.  It's a fun and at times silly movie.  Good silly though.  Makes fun of all the right things for this movie/generation.  Gave me flashbacks of some old games I used to spend too much time on back in the day.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|We did this for Book Club and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The complex characters, the insight into what happens to a lot of children who are fostered, the need to love and be loved and how one girl found a way to communicate using the language of flowers. Great book couldn't put it down.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|classic, true story of a girl and her views on life. this should be REQUIRED reading in 7th/8th grade. No doubt about it. Will be getting a copy for my daughter in another few years
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This book has been very insightful into how I manage my diet and what I put in my mouth. I am losing weight without feeling as though I am on a diet. Basically it is just changing your eating habits and becoming aware of what you eat.
B00640UICA|1.0|I found this way to child like and boring. Maybe children would enjoy it, very young children. Wasn't for me.
140006922X|5.0|Excellent read. Nice historical depiction of the lives and times of such an importantly misunderstood era. Good read for anyone of any religion or not.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'm an ol' man and I still liked it.  I didn't realize when I purchased it that it was intended for a younger audience but the writing is solid and the characters engaging.  I would recommend it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show! The characters are endearing and hilarious! Zoey is as quirky and adorable as ever! This second season is even better than the first and I can't wait till the third season comes out on sept 16th!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best game ever want to play minecraft but have no xbox or dpnt have a pc play this game i cant wait for endermen and the actual nether add hunger bar mojang
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for android is an amazing application because it allows you to read any book at anytime, anywhere. The other great thing about kindle for android is that you can find most titles, authors, genres, for a convenient price.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I had problems with the gross descriptions of the whippings, etc.  The basic premis was good.  Couldn't the book have achived that status  by toning down the said description?  The third book was more palatible.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took me a weekend to read..need I say more!  A well-written ever changing story, that kept me guessing .
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great boredom buster for my son and myself. Easy to play - will definitely keep this app for awhile.
B00000K2W1|5.0|If you were not an adult in the 60's, any explanation would be moot.  Janis was fantastic.  She is a true loss to us all.
B008469DGY|4.0|Fun and challenging game. Not full golf, but still skill needed to master it. I like it. At least the hole moves around, along with where you shoot from. Word to the wise, its timed. You earn extra time with red zone and hole in one landings. I missed if it told me the courses are timed and you have to earn points to advance.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|I love this movie it's one of my all time favorite movies!!! I've watched it countless of times!! Who doesn't like singing and dancing penguins?! All the characters in this movie are soo adorable and the singing is awesome! I love singing along to the songs! Personally who ever doesn't like this movie is CRAZY!!!
1781162646|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, to me, this is a fine love story of young people, and the horror part is not bad, though not a main point of this book.
B00011KHTM|5.0|After mixed results with generic adapters, I went with this Apple unit.  Unlike the generics that gave odd colors on the display, this one works perfectly.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|I recently viewed this with my 10yr old son, and loved it even more than the first time.  One of the best coming of age movies of all time - River Phoenix is absolutely brilliant!  What a loss of such a huge talent...
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Absolutely excellent.  Gripping story, expertly told and acted.  This show will have you on the edge of your seat---without resorting to the all-too-common tricks of lurid detail, red herrings, etc.
B0044WSF5M|4.0|Old 50'/60's Movie about a group of teenagers. Woolfman Jack was a Hit!!  Steve(aka Ritchie Cunningham) and Shirley are the primary pair, lots of other greats as well!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Works great. Our power was out and I was able to see to get my contacts out! I would definitely download this free app.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|I was hesitant because some of the reviews questioned the audio quality. So far as I already had 8 of the CDs a few worn and most Audio coming out of the EU is very good, I went with it, I played a few back to back, \\"Dear Heather\\", was a draw, but the production of \\"Ten New Songs\\" sounded crisper, and would say this might have been a product of better production, or manufacturing equipment.<br />So far if your a fan or interested this is a great value. For the price of 3 or 4 you get 11.<br /> I do not think it is fair to compare some of the early works as I have them in circa 1987 early analog to digital transfers, I am going to play these through my OPPO, or some Pro Players, and see if my initial thoughts change.<br />I was fortunate enough to get into LC's work from the release of his first record. My first memory of seeing him was in a Hotel Barber Shop in 1967* in Philadelphia. I went to London and was sitting in a Pub shortly after that and found out he had come into Heathrow to do a show on BBC. Since Then have been a fan and even read a couple books and still find him to be a creditable artist, now time tested.<br />The only negative for me is the cardboard sleeves, I will store them in something offering more protection. But I do this with all media that comes that way.<br /><br />*I am pretty sure of the date, time was different in the 1960's.
1623420148|4.0|very good book I enjoyed it very much.  would definitely buy more books just like it.  please recommend any more to me.<br />thank you.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|It seems like the band has woken from a slumber - this album hits hard and sounds great.  I rank it up with the very best of the 'modern' Clutch albums.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An easy read.  First person recollection from a humble man makes this an excellent read. I'd offer this to a teen interested in defending our country.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Does exactly what I need it to do.  Have a large Mac monitor with an old FireWire connection.  Plugs directly into my Macbook Pro with no problems.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|received my package few hours ago and i was so excited to mount my monitor.. only to realize i received a broken one. At first i thought that was the way it was suppose to look like, but after seeing some youtube clips i knew something was wrong right away. Thankfully amazon has a awesome return policy so i will report back on how it goes. They are gonna replace it free of charge. If i do receive my replacement promptly i will change my ratings.<br /><br />Edit: Ok i received my replacement fairly quickly and they also sent a ups driver to pick up the old broken one. Everything free of charge thank you amazon for your good return policy. The mount itself is very sturdy and rotates and turns and spins on every joint. Very easy to install even when i had a super thick desk. The only thing was that i found some of the joints to be on too tight and i had to loosen it with the tools provided. All in all a very good mount for the price.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I love the twist on the original movie... This is a great movie to sit and watch on a family movie ngiht.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|While the first two season are some of my favorite stories and have some of the truest Trek philosophies, the third season was a huge turning point for the series.  Many characters stories are expanded and many plot points carry over from episode to episode.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I'm assuming a lot of people changed the channel before watching Sons of Anarchy before really getting into the characters and story lines.  Maybe I'm giving it more credit than is due, but I love following this series and the only way I've been able to stay in step with it is through Amazon.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Dredd appears to be an action packed awesome thrill ride.  It's more like all the cut scenes from a video game.  The Slo-mo effect, while interesting, was an inaccurate representation of what the effects would be.  The shoot outs were, again, more video game style violence and after the third one I felt as if the movie was on repeat.  If I wanted to play a first person shooter, I would.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The third season is as good if not better than the other two. So many twists and turns in the life of the Grantham family with equally compelling drama happening downstairs.
0345803485|3.0|I first read Nora Roberts and I realized they have similar names: Anna, Ray, Ethan and both parents adopted 3 kids. The moms were a doctor who were on the hospital when they arrived after the abuses.... Cameron and Anna are similar to Christian and Anna of Fiftyshades. Cameron with gray eyes and dark abused past, Anna with big brown eyes. Anna dresses like Anna of Fifty Shades. Some things Anna does is the same as Fifty like she look through Cameron between her eyelashes, flutter them, etc.  Then, I found out Fifty book 1 was published April of 2012. Sea Swept was published Jan 1998. So, Nora Roberts is original...<br />Is it coincidence? I don't think so....
B005C8ENI0|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. After we watched on prime for free a week, it starts to charge, when we were about to watch again. Guess it is popular. The story is a well written  drama, keeps audience in tune till the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does what it was designed for.  always handy when you have too much to calculate in your head.  great on kendle
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|This season just gets even more and more interesting as I watch the episodes. What really made this an exciting season was the fact that instead of answering questions it made me ask myself even more questions, forcing me to keep watching episode after episode.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|A good read and really throws a lot of insight on how important a vision and culture is to create a sustainable entity in the continuously morphing digital era apart from just looking at the bottom and top lines..
B004X80QNG|1.0|They came out with version 3 already so for a free app they give us version 2, um yea...........would have rather the version 3 be the faotd instead of this....
B007PF7MGS|4.0|I read through the book and found it convincing enough to give it a go. The recipes are easy to prepare with readily available ingredients.  Case studies validate the McDougall approach.
B004P68T30|5.0|This is the first talking book I've ordered for my Kindle Fire and I was really surprised at the level of interactivity that is built in.
0312330537|4.0|I just received the book so I haven't had a chance to read it yet.<br />I've heard nothing but good things about this book, so I am looking forward to getting started
0345803485|5.0|I read this because many friends said that it was great, a couple didn't like it because they said it seemed like it was written by a third grade girl.  I disagreed, and thought that it was a good read. It was something that maybe because of the anticipation of what was to come, I hated to put the book down. It is racy but not degrading.It elevates your heart rate and leaves you wanting more. As soon as I finished the first book I went to a secondhand book store and started reading the second book to see what was going to happen next. I then texted my friend who has all three books and asked her to bring the second book to work the next day so I didn't have to buy it. I just loaned Book one:Fifty Shades of Grey to another coworker, and she is now reading it.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I have tried many mahjong games but this one is the most fun and I just don't get tired of it.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Not one of Grisham's best novels. About half way through it started to get interesting, but that was way too late to save it. I wish I'd skipped it all together.
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|These days I don't listen to the radio, so when I learn of an artist, it's either through television or word of mouth.  I just happened to catch Ariana Grande singing a duet on a morning show and just as I was about to shut the TV off, Ariana was introduced.  I decided to listen, not having high hopes for this young lady that I had never heard of.  As soon as she began to sing, I thought hmmm.... she seems to be channelling Mariah Carey.  I decided to drop some dollars on her album and the rest is history.<br /><br />This is a nice pop album with a few ballads thrown in by a person who sounds quite talented.  This is an album that can be played all the way through.  I like the songs but what I really like is that this album has Mariah Carey written all over it.  Lyrically, the songs are young pop, but the vocal range and style remind me of Mariah Carey of old, and modern day Mariah.  In fact, since Mariah Carey is 12 at heart, I can see her selecting these songs to sing.  What's refreshing is that the material within this album is appropriate for its singer, Ariana Grande.  It is clear that Ariana will come into her own and develop her own true style and when she does, she will be a threat.  When she does, she will get 5 stars instead of 4.<br /><br />These days, we can't take talented young singers for granted.  An artist may be a flash in the pan no matter what their talents.  These days, it could be 10 years between albums.  Good albums are scarce.  This is a good album.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|I like Avenged Sevenfold anyways but this CD is awesome. I can sit and listen to the entire album from beginning to end without skipping through songs that I don't like.
B0071BY1ZQ|2.0|Ode is the latest in a string of self-indulgent meanderings by jazz pianists that I have had the misfortune to purchase based on rave reviews by the jazz press.<br /><br />While jazz is about improvisation, the improvisation should mean something. Lester Young famously asked a young bebopper who played several frenetic choruses with all of the cliches with great dexterity \\"Great - but can you sing me a song?\\" Improvisation should sing something - music is still about melody, harmony and rhythm. No matter how far out, the music still comes down to this.<br /><br />I purchased Vijay Iyer's latest just before I purchased Ode. Ode is more musical than Iyer's attempts to reduce music to math, but only just. In most cases, I have the same complaints about both discs. There is no discernable melody most of the time, nor is there reference to one. The music doesn't swing - the notes are just sort of there. It just isn't very interesting. Even avant garde music has a point of interest to it and this doesn't - it just meanders no where in particular.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I think the fact Jack is set up against the military here adds something.  He as a good guy ex military cop can't stand the thought that the bad guy might be a soldier and that he is being protected by the big end of town.<br /><br />As usual I just opened it and read it pretty well straight through.  That works really well until you get to the last book and have to wait months for the next one....
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using this for some time, I had it on my Thunderbolt, Galaxy S4, S5, Note 7 (both of them). Now using it on my Galaxy S7 Edge.
B0031RS44S|5.0|Nice to meet the team.<br />Great yarn.<br />One day, Reacher is going to slam dunk that woman...<br />Please!<br />The sexual tension between them is tangible.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Superb acting and content; easy to become involved with the well developed characters.<br />Great costumes and scenery<br />Always waiting for next episode
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Well, Jack has a busted nose.  Pity.  he never got hit before.  I like the fact this book took a different slant on things and made him work hard for his inevitable victory.<br />Things didn't fall into place for him and things like the car chases were a little different from other books.<br />I am a big fan of Lee Child's character, Jack Reacher and as usual just read it in one or two sittings.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Not elementary.  At least middle school level. Benedict Cumberbatch adds his unique.... not charm because that is not a defining attribute of his Sherlock... but intensity.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|When I finally got towards the end of this great book I was reminded of the classic siege in the movie, 'Straw Dogs.'<br />A man's home is his castle.  Invade it at your peril.<br /><br />Great last page as well.
B007THA4FI|5.0|It is a good read!  JK Rowling has done it again!  Keep up the good work cause I love your books!
B00B97SNJI|5.0|My favorite band is continuing their greatness!  Your lyrics and musical talents are delightful.  Plesase come to Minnesota more often.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Lots of stress free fun. Colorful graphics. Great for bubble game players. Can be challenging at some levels. Can be addictive!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Bravo !  A must read for any and all history buffs.  You will be delighted you took the time to delve deeply.
1400052181|5.0|It is  a very readable book! Just love it ! It is required as a book for the course of Issues in Teacher Education, at first I don't know why the professor choose this book, but I found it is a good book anyway.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You won't be able to put this book down! Beautifully written, it is an excellent close to the trilogy. I'll definitely be reading the series over and over.
B004DMO8U4|3.0|Given the caliber of the actors, this could have been a much smarter movie. Instead, it dumbs down pretty fast and makes big action and explosions the focus. Fun enough escapism, but wasted potential.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Not the best movie he ever made, but good action and mindless entertainment.  Someone always getting shot or blown up
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I really love this app!  I now am able to &#34;really&#34; hear my music on my Kindle Fire.  Highly recommend this volume app to anyone who needs more volume in their music.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|It will be a classic.  My daughter loves it and so do I.  It's Disney so just about everything they make turns to gold
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|love this series. The characters are taking a few risks and willing to do The best of their circumstances.hard to put down
B008469DGY|4.0|Tons of fun. Great responsiveness. I like how there are so many things the player can do with the ball.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|This book contains an indictment of modern power exercised by real men who make mistakes and are condemned for it by the out of touch. The book is well written but the &#34;good guys&#34; are annoying in their self-righteousness.  If they were Americans they would be called silly liberals. If you are not a liberal you need to be prepared to view them with contempt.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Written with the guy telling the whole story. Very different and it made it a very good read. I would reccomed this book to my friends that read.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Cool graphics. That's about it. Expected more from Morgan Freeman. Certainly not the best Tom Cruise movie I've ever seen.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Slow gets stuck....use it to help fall asleep;; boring....having more fun just wrighting this review..may provide more excitement for seniors
0345529057|4.0|I am an avid fan of the HBO series and yet had some trouble keeping the characters and their alliances straight so this was a perfect read for me. I barely looked up at anything while reading the first book where the groundwork is laid for the various 'houses' going to war for the Iron Throne. While it took awhile and sometimes whole seasons to get the full characters personalities, the book does what books usually do-give you the details and back story of the characters. For those who have trouble waiting another several months for the next season, this is a great primer and for those new to the series, give it a try; you will probably love it! And FYI, Khaleesi and Tyrion still come across as the most moral of those with any real power.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I eagerly awaited it, hooked it up using both my MacBookPro and my iPhone 4S and also an Android phone, and was surprised at the ease of use that I could watch YouTube videos, and from Chrome on the MBP, Internet content (That does not seem to be ready for IOS 6 on the iPhone yet.)<br /><br />Then, I went home and tried to do the same. Alas, I have an AirPort TimeCapsule Extreme with Dual-band connections that are not supported by the Chromecast. It insists on 2.4GHz. It did not even recognize the networks. I tried to set them up manually, to no avail. Even if I could disable the 5GHz on the APTC, I wouldn't. So I must re-connect my retired Cisco E4200v1 wireless router, and disable the 5GHz band (which I can do), or re-enable wi-fi on my UVerse gateway (which doesn't seem to have 2.4GHz wireless), only using them for the Chromecast.<br /><br />Other than that (and that is a BIG that!) it does what it does, even if I turn my iPhone off, it still was streaming over the network it connected to.<br /><br />I called the GooglePlay support people, and while she was very friendly and helpful, in the end, I am supposed to downgrade my APTC firmware (which I won't). But the support site does say that they are working on it, but do you really think that Google wants to play nicely with Apple!<br /><br />I was also a little bummed that the Netflix offer was pulled so quickly. I ordered on July 26, and it was off the table by then.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|For those who like special affects, realize that over-blown disasters are made for movies and wants to know well-rounded characters in their stories, this is a great movie. I've shown it to children from 12 up and adults and it's always received with high praise. I truly felt for John Cusack trying to save his family from the earth's great 're-boot' and the humanity shown by some of the fictional leaders was touching. The lead's two children are just fantastic and very brave at times giving other children one of their own to cheer for. And again, the special affects are just fabulous.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I first played this on PC years ago, and was blown away.  It is just as perfect -- if not better -- on my Android.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took 4 different attempts at getting into this book. Several friends in a book club suggested it as a great read but it was hard to pick up and easy to put down....until I reached the first plot twist and couldn't put it down. The writing is great....the ending not so much, but at least I can say I didn't have it figured out!
B005FPT51K|5.0|This product working very well over 3G network. Is very easy to install. I hope, in a near future this company will development a software for Android.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Excellent movie!  I have watched this over 25 times!  Great story, great music and an excellent cast.  Everyone that has watched this movie with me has enjoyed it!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|It was an interesting read because he obviously has a good story, but I think the autobiography was a bad choice. He doesn't use the color adjectives and narratives that a professional author would.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|A fine cast makes up for the structural changes made to Weisberger's best seller. Meryl Streep once again nails it.
B001RUXW48|5.0|Love this movie. Great spy flick. Leo does a great job acting in this movie. I really enjoyed it. Lots of action and suspense.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I had forgotten how to be happy as a human, thank you Ms Rand. Integrity only matters to one's own self. What others think truly does not matter. It is unfortunate that she was an atheist and did not understand that true Christianity and the popular belief of the Church are not the same thing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the game it is a pretty good game it does very well explaining how to play. I like that it keeps going even when your not logged in.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Good writing on emotions, but the ending was rather abrupt without too much detail, which she had in the rest of the book.
B00ALKPTFA|5.0|I really loved the way this book is written. The ideas are crystal clear, at the end of each chapter there is a very precise summary, and the whole story its interwoven with a beautiful small story that it stuck on my head.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to improve his/her life.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Really great. Its fun, thrilling. I really enjoy movies based on something factual and they made another movie to fill that role. Im surprised by Aflec in this movie
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO BLITZ is highly entertaining and addictive for all bingo lovers. It uses quality graphics and themes to keep your attention. Highly recommend for bingo players of all ages.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Not a musical!! Super funny, great cast, incredible voices. I didnt expect to enjoy this movie so much butnive seen it at least 5-6 more times randomly and have enjoyed it everytime.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is nothing like other books if u like book u should read this book. Best book i have read and i am only 13<br /><br />The reason why I gave this book 5 stars is that it was easy for me to read and it so good what not good great. If u are a parent and u want your child to read a book get them this book Enders game. I am 13 and don't think i am a adult because i am not.<br /><br />All i have to say is that u have to read the book to truly understand
B0055OK2T0|3.0|Its just alright. It was fun to watch I was interested but I didnt walk away thinking wow just what a great movie. Its ok for a one time watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is ridiculously good! I am glad I finished it because I couldn't stop watching it and it was taking over my life! : )
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Im one-sided on these movies. They are some of my favorite games and ive seen all the movies. They are as good as any other zombie series.
B00CATONCA|5.0|i love that the '3' on the case turns the light on and off. easy assembly and a wonderful case. can't wait for next one to come out!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Another fun entertaining denzel movie. He was convincing as usual. The movie kinda gets off to a slow start tho.
B004LGPBZI|5.0|This album begins with a song of punching rock and roll and then, through mellow reflective songs and more psychedelic ones, the refusal to compromise with a feeling of straight forward reverence FOR rock and roll - English style (British and Irish style) based upon US 50s rock and roll - is just purebred... It is an incredibly artistic piece of work - proud to be demonstrating a reverence for the voices that have turned these guys on... It is worth checking out the concert in full - every damn song - on YouTube from their concert some years ago at Casino de Paris... Nothing ever could beat that sound or the mastery of the pounding melodic love for what they do. It's as though the lead singer has realised that it was time to step away from an older brother and show rock and roll who's boss. He does this with true artistry and the good luck to be working with amazing musicians next to him as gifted as him. Brilliant at times... Most of the songs are perfect for what they are meant to be. I wish the Casino de Paris live concert would be released because it's a rare thing.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I love the borne movies this was not my favorite. Its just kinda of a stretch. Its really slow. Maybe its bc its setting up another but this was a bad follow up
B00CELB94E|5.0|Some beautiful shining songs... Bit more dreamy and laid back than the other album (apart from the massive first track and a couple of others)...<br />Like a welcome, easy-going, English, rainy, Sunday-morning sort of album with some.post punk rock and roll thrown into the mix.<br />Once again this cool album is a tribute to the full band of musicians - Archer and Bell of course - plus all others - but full respect must be heaped upon the eccentric artist at the front who just gets better... The production pushes his voice very far front this time as though to emphasise the point of how little he cares for its detractors - and this arguably goes too far... but, it gives a strange quality of intimacy and old time simplicity to the sound... The voice sounds great to me, its swagger more exaggerated... His love for Lennon needs no justification by him at all - (I think he flaunts it further just to infuriate the critics and this is great for me to hear and see, because Lennon would probably be singing along with this guy by now anyway)... the entire band flaunt their influences (many from the 50s, 60s and 70s) without disguise - just as painters and musicians have done for centuries... You listen to this album and you escape awhile... It isn't trying to do more than be what it is... Just a good rock and roll album - one of many to come we hope... so put it in your pipe and smoke it
B00BF123WG|5.0|Really good. Fully truthful I dono. It says it is. Im sure most of it is true. Aside from that all around great film
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever I got this game a week ago and I can't stop playing it I recommend geting pro editor you can change from survival to creative
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Always end up falling asleep in these movies they never hold my attention. I try to enjoy them but they always out me to sleep at the begining
B009AY04A8|4.0|Kind of slow while reading dialogue, but fun puzzles.  Too bad it doesn't resolve completely by the end.  I enjoyed it.
160774273X|2.0|Its to complex I was looking for easy bread recipes.<br />There are only a few recipes that would be easy to make.
B008VVT51U|5.0|The actors did such a wonderful job.  It was a very good story.  The movie did a nice job depicting what it's like to get old.  The filming was done especially well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got this book because of the outstanding reviews. Upon reading it, one sitting, I had to agree. The characters are strong and vibrant. Yes, it is true, the book had me laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time.  Well worth your time and money.
B002APU580|5.0|Sadly in a post Twilight world I can't watch the scene at the first dance without thinking the characters are vampires that will break out into sparkles soon.
1609611543|5.0|Great book considering new guidelines on gluten sensitivity again what you don't know can hurt you. a must read book
B00742GBDM|5.0|My favorite classic book to movie adaptation except for Robinson Crueso. This was such a fun movie, even my husband said it didn't make him want to jump off a bridge when he sat through it. High praise for him
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought the story line followed the book very well but actually improved on it in some places.  I enjoyed the movie!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Joss Whedon does such an incredible job managing large casts, this movie was so fun to watch. It's the best movie I saw all summer
B008JEJN8O|5.0|My husband has heard about these from other people and wanted to try them. He wanted something comfortable to just slip on when stepping outside or running around on the weekends. I of course had to get involve and found out that they run big, so we ordered him a pair that were a size smaller than he usually would have gotten. They fit great and he loves them. He has tried many different styles of summer shoes, and none of them are as comfortable as these are- according to him!!
B002PNDEXK|5.0|One of the best book to screen adaptations I've watched. Great movie, very enjoyable, and truer to the actual plot than most
B007KZY1YY|1.0|No plot, unlikable and undeveloped characters. Not even very sexy! A bit of a sad comment on the state of humanity.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Greater minds than I have reviewed this book, but I can tell you I was able to read the book without the usual distractions of a poorly converted digital copy, so kudos
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Honestly the story was pretty simple but it was definitely a fun, enjoyable, good-hearted family movie.<br /><br />I say 4 stars because coming from an art and computer graphics background, I super appreciate the incredible work they did with all of the art and the graphics.  The realism and beauty of the hair and cloth dynamics was breath-taking.  Color palette and lighting was awesome.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|My favorite Austen novel, easily the most accessible, and really, who can hate the book the inspired Clueless. Read it!
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Original was like a cartoon.. This reads like one of the batman  novels from the 90's. SPOILER alert... He NEVER takes his helmet off, lol. I think he sleeps in it... Lol nice
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This is a good app for new comers if you just starting the angry bids series one should start with thise<br /><br />that is why I choose the
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and affordable. Can't stop playing it. Glad they made a game for fans of the movie characters. They are hilarious :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like how the levels make you think and can be quite challenging at times!!! definetely recommend if you like to work your brain and have fun at the same time
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|There was only one movie that could have followed up the mega smash that was &#34;The Avengers&#34;, and that is bringing it back around to what started the Marvel phenomenon on film (well, at least Phase 1), with the close to the story of Tony Stark as we've known him.<br /><br />In the series' third entry, Shane Black does a stellar job taking the directorial reigns from Jon Favreau, as he and Downey's chemistry (having worked together previously on the much slept-on comedy noir flick &#34;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang&#34;) is on display throughout. The film is well cast (with the whole team of Paltrow, Cheadle, and Favreau back in the saddle), well-written and witty, superbly acted and a just a lot of fun! If you're a fan of Marvel, RDJ, or movies in general, there's no way you should miss this one. The final act alone is worth the price of admission.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Can't wait for the forthcoming film adaptation. That is all.<br /><br />BUT What is with this mandated 20 word minimum review nonsense! Get real Amazon. It's what is said. Not how long it takes one to say it.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|This was so cute!! I love everything about it :) she did a great job with the little things like Lola's outfit and I loved how she put Anna and st. Clair in there too!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I don't have time to write a lengthy review, but this novel was interesting. It shed some light on cancer. It was a beautiful love story. The book did what it was  supposed to do. It wasn't the best book I've  ever read. I finished it in exactly one day. This book definitely made me fall in love with the characters, however I somehow didn't cry at the end. Tears were forming in my eyes, but nothing over extreme. This Is an amazing book to read.
B000I9UA30|5.0|This movie rates an A+++ for all of us sci fi nerds.  I could watch this movie again and again
034580404X|5.0|The customer should buy all three books!  It's sexual, mysterious & fast paced!!!  Wonder what E. L. James will write next!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Its a great show with great actors I love the story line and the bikes since I ride motorcycle too!!!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Loved this book! Great sequel it had the perfect amount of romance and action and I loved it! Must read
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|You have to watch this just for the effects. But the story line is great you won't expect what happens . A truly great movie , today it's hard to come up with a new idea, but I think this is as close as your gonna get.
B00271B752|5.0|Great movie to watch when you are bored, trying to kill time, and have popcorn! Al Pacino was so young!!!! :)
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This startlingly honest tale of the bravery we all take for granted will stAy with me for a long time. A must read for anyone who loves America.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Plays well and looks very colorful.  I have it on my android phone and would enjoy it more on a larger screen.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I truly have fun playing this game and so do all my friends. I also like that it does not need internet because most of these games need internet
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Sometimes I get the book and sometimes I don't.  It appears on my Kindle..... I pad.....but not on my android cell.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is very nice! I'm going to check out more g5 games. Hopefully there 're as good as this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Better than the first book!  Very well written, couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend this book.  Looking forward to the movie.
B000068FXX|5.0|this is my favorite supertramp  album. I have wanted it on cd for quite a while. It sounds fantastic  and came  in perfect condition
B000SVZIR6|5.0|Purchase this movie and the accompanying soundtrack.  You won't regret it.  \\"This\\" version of \\"the story\\" is, without question, the most memorable and visually breathtaking.  The location for filming was picturesque and the music is simply beautiful.  Be sure to watch The Making Of Anna and the King.  That is an amazing story, in and of itself.  Simply said...enjoy this wonderful movie and the music, over and over!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Very Good and lovely product. Dream Toy. Back to the future is always my favourite. Hope can have others shortly.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love Amazon and it's great selections of DVD and Downton Abbey is welcomed gifts to my library. America is in love with the Royals so this is the closest we can get. Storyline and casts are exceptional. Can't wait for January for new season!! Shipments always come when promised. Thank you
B0089LOG02|4.0|An enjoyable, fast read with interesting twists as you traveled back and forth throughout the decades with the characters in this book.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|If you're a music lover, a recording geek or a gearhead this is a must have Blu Ray. Dave Grohl does a great job with this rockumentary
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This is my favorite John Legend CD since Get Lifted!  Kudos to John for putting out a great and timely R&B compilation - every song is a good one!  If you are on the fence go ahead and get a copy, you won't regret it.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Solid value. Just be sure to clip it on the person...not on an object in front of them as it picks up too much background noise and is not &#34;hot&#34; enough without a mixer
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have read the books and now I have the movies. It is a perfect circle for the magic of Harry Potter.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I couldn't even finish it. The repetition was mind numbing. Did the writer copy and paste 'Oh my' or did she type it every couple sentences?<br /><br />My husband bought me this book because of the hype. He heard it would make me 'frisky'. Well what it did was make me angry. I noticed the uncanny resemblance of Christian and Anastasia to Edward and Bella right off the bat. I am a Twilight Fanatic and soon found out that this story started as fan fiction. Ms. James simply tapped into what made Twilight a sensation. It cannot be her gift for the written word because her grammar is atrocious.<br /><br />If you haven't bought this book yet...Don't! You can get plenty of Twilight fan fiction (that's written better) for free on a multitude of sites online. fanfiction.com is my favorite and wattpad is good too.
B0034KHFM4|5.0|Get into it and into it and into it and it never ever ever ever ends. Pop music at it's finest.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I've watched a lot of tv shows revolving around cops, detectives, etc. but this is the best by far.<br />Wish I had a team like Mackey's!!!!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|One of the most fun and challenging racing games yet! The graphics totally rock and I Love the drifting races. My wife even likes racing on it. We are trying to figure out how to race each other. Anyone no how to sync two kindles????
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the characters chemistry and each episode has a engaging storyline, but it's not too serious. On of my favorite shows.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I love the plot twists and the special effects are amazing.  Not a fan of strong language, and the scene with the chick in the beginning was a little tasteless, I felt.  However, the rest of the plot completely makes up for it.  Mark Ruffalo's best movie yet!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book I found it to be relaxing and enjoyable, like watching a hallmark movie. I liked the characters and found them believable typical of a rural Irish community , l felt a little homesick at times. This book contains laughter and sadness great read while on vacation.
098478280X|5.0|The delivery was quite fast and on time, as I was busy with my review for the upcoming interviews. A great outline for people who are going to take coding interviews without a to-do list.
030759565X|5.0|I love this book so much! There are so many delicious recipes here I couldn't even begin to choose my favorite.  Everything is low fuss and is made with ingredients I have in my pantry, nothing over the top fancy here.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I always wanted to watch this series never had the chance.  The story is great and so is the acting by a really great cast ;)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn's ability to craft diverse characters and let the reader explore their psyches is just incredible.  This is  psychological thrill writing at its best.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very fun game. Good time waster, but really good. The puzzles are great too. Great hidden object game. Fun to play
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I don't like short stories as a rule, but he wove them all together in a way that seemed like one.  Also these stories left you with something to think about long after you closed the book.  These are human stories of us all.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I listen to this song over and over and over. I may be tired of it but I don't care!.<br /><br />Imagine myself on stage and people applause! ;)
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|This game wworks wwell, and has quite an addictivve tinge to it, yet, for some reason, wwhen I vvisited a neighbor, it glitched and replaced his farm wwith mine! I read other's comments, and they seem to havve the same problem. Prithee thy findeth this helpfull, indeed.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|It's fairly good but I don't think it's their best work. They never repeat the same sound in each album they release, which I really like.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Please add enderman and villages and caves too! Thanks Mojang for making it better and better as you develop this awesome game!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Absolutely amazing story!! The twist at the end is so far from the ordinary. I am never let down by Sparks. Looking forward to read his new book and the couple old ones I haven't gotten to yet! I recommend this book to anyone.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|The plots are pretty good although things are wearing a bit thin. Still enjoyable to watch Dex and the others
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book has shown me that history repeats itself. How coud this be going on RIGHT NOW? Def a must read.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|A show you can watch that doesn't necessarily build on the preceding episode. So I rate it four stars for it's edge of the seat interest.
B00B52F278|5.0|This is one of my favorite series.  I have all 4 seasons and will be watching them often.<br />the men are all so very handsome.
B003G4W49C|2.0|Like all literature, good sci-fi needs characters the reader can relate to.  I can live with descriptions of incredible technologies, even when the scientific support is shaky or absent (as is the case in this book), but this book has a thin plot, superficial character building and the characters' relationships are not developed beyond what the author spoon-feeds us.<br />For example, each time Ender experiences apparent injustices, the author quickly resolves any questions by having Ender explain his opponent's motives, which are mostly laughably shallow.<br />Even for &#34;youth&#34; literature, this book falls short.  At least I won't need to watch the movie...
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I've been through it all but mostly the guilt. The &#34;why am I not good enough&#34;. Now I can stand my ground, hold my head high, if I want to, and embrace the fact I love being alone. I need to be alone for large chunks of the day. I believe my extrovert husband understood this more than I.  It is a relief and a validation. Thank you Susan Cain.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|They combine all the essential elements -  great actors (having fun), character actors, topics, story lines, production value - to make a reliable, tasty recipe for  high quality, fun binge viewing.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love once upon a time. I watch this with my children. Great twist to traditional fairytales making it exciting for everyone to watch. Cant wait for season 3 to start.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever.  Great writing great acting thoughtful characters. Simply the best show on Tv or down load
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Any fan of Fleetwood Mac (or Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks or Christine McVie) should own this album. It contains many songs for which this band is known for including &#34;Go Your Own Way&#34; and &#34;Dreams&#34;. Mick Fleetwood's rhythm pairs perfectly with the amazing guitar talents of John McVie and Lindsey Buckingham.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|From beginning to end the history, science and action keep you turning the pages as fast as you can.  So what if the quantum physics discussion was a little vague, as some reviewers point out? Have you ever sat through a Michael Crichton quantum physics discussion? He makes you want to shoot yourself. At least Rollins doesn't torture us with the science like Crichton does. And I have a degree in Nuclear Engineering too and loved this book. The new guy Duncan was OK, but I'm waiting for the guy with the dog to return.
1576754227|3.0|This book is OK...<br /><br />It contains what I think is generally good advice regarding time management.<br /><br />My main issue is that I've read a lot of the very specific advice before in Getting Things Done by David Allen, and 4 Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss.<br /><br />If you've read both of those books, there is really no reason to read this one.  In fact I'd recommend reading both of those instead, because they cover everything in this and more.<br /><br />What's covered in this books is in a nutshell:<br /><br />-a RELENTLESS focus on the MOST IMPORTANT tasks over the less important.  The author reminds you that you will NEVER be caught up with everything you have to do, and the average person has somewhere between 110%-140% of what they can actually handle on their plate.  Getting caught up is should not be the goal, rather honing in on the 3 MOST IMPORTANT tasks of 20, and making sure those get done even though they are the hardest, most complicated, time consuming, boring, etc. is a major key to success.<br /><br />-Pareto Principle a.k.a 80/20 rule.<br /><br />-Make lists of everything you need to do.<br /><br />-Learn to plan and identify NEXT ACTIONS in advance.  He recommends a daily / weekly / monthly split, but I think there are better ways to go about this.<br /><br />-Pick the hardest, but most important and meaningful tasks first.<br /><br />-Don't let setbacks phase you.  observe them, observe your feelings, acknowledge them, but continue.<br /><br />One other comment about the book, the font must be 20 pt, very large, and it's a short book at only 120 pages.  It took my only about 2-3 hours to read.  I subtract points for this, b/c although some great books can be short - in the particular style that the author writes, you won't find deep meaning or context in his message.<br /><br />He may tell you to pick the hardest, most important task first for example, but without a well-written anecdote, or interesting statistic, it's more difficult to fully contextualize his advice and some of it gets lost.<br /><br />Overall, good advice, but I've read most of it before in the two aforementioned books.  Had I not read Gettings Things Done or 4 Hour Work Week, I would have probably given this a 3.5 / 4.<br /><br />An ok read, doesn't take too long, but I'd recommend GTD and 4HWW over this.
B007N579X6|5.0|Everyone should have Minions. My wife and I actually enjoyed it more than our Grandkids. We're looking forward to DM2...
0525478817|5.0|When I first heard of this book, i was just wandering around social media. Then I saw one of my favorite accounts raving, saying that they had just began it and were already in love with this bundle of words called a book. Even the people in the comments were raving; I knew I had to read it.<br /><br />I ordered the book a week later off of my mother's account a week later; and finished it in 22 hours flat. I would have gotten it done sooner, but i had to work that day.<br />Now for the real review.<br /><br />When I began the book, I loved Hazel's character. Her sophisticated, massive vocabulary she bore impressed me. Also her love for America's Next Top Model added a little humorous side.<br /><br />Augustus's character instantly made me love him. His terribly deadly driving made me chuckle.<br /><br />And i was happy when they watched V for Vendenna for the first time; i knew they would be a great couple.<br /><br />John Green's writing format and word choice stunned me. His lovely metaphors and life philosophies were wonderful.<br /><br />The flow of the story was unmistakenbly perfect.<br /><br />Before i flood amazon with this one review, ill wrap it up.<br /><br />This book was perfect, and i highly reccommend it.<br /><br />It was ful of humor, love, sadness, happiness, and the perfect amount of plot twists.<br /><br />It's a tear jerker, ill warn you.
B00C2U6EUG|5.0|I loved the bonus CD. It was very good, almost as good as the actual soundtrack. This was  a great purchase!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hilarious and fun for all who play can't get enough of this game.  Every time we play as a family we just can't stop laughing.
B002KVZBGA|5.0|Forget the &#34;remake&#34; - which was an &#34;ok&#34; movie.  The original Italian Job is one of the most perfect movies of all time.<br /><br />If you're a car nut, you can't help but love this movie.  From the Lamborghini Miura racing through the Alps, to Michael Caine in the Aston DB5 to the 3 mini coopers that end up starring in the movie.  The best storyline, at a time when the best actors were still around and when the best cars in the world ever made were relatively new.  Perfection indeed !<br /><br />The self preservation society will always be the best !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fantastic and it is free.  That is pretty rare!  I love the app , it is large print and easy to see and use.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|The music made the movie and this is the music.  Very infectious and varied. I've gotten hooked on a Capella singing lately.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This game is for a computer. You can tap Levels and it won't do a Damn thing! Totally a waist of time. I recommend that you never get it.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Enjoyed every episode.  Loved each of the characters, the setting, and grtting to see the social structure of that era.  It was all just great!
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is just an awesome movie. It's funny and my kids absolutely love it. It holds their attention all the way through. Love it!
B00D6M86RS|3.0|I have purchased most of the Zen Pinball tables for both my iPad and my MAC.<br /><br />For quality and entertainment I would give 5 stars.<br /><br />The physics and animations are awesome, and each table is a very entertaining play.<br /><br />My only beef, is that, unlike the Zen Pinball for the Playstation 3 / PS Vita platforms, the apps for the iPad and the MAC are all separate costs, and to play a table on both, you have to pay twice.<br /><br />Also, the number of tables available for the tablet and MAC versions are not yet caught up to the Playstation / Xbox platforms yet.<br /><br />Perhaps a cross buy at a slightly higher price would work... maybe across all platforms...???
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Incredibly talented cast. Great story line, very unique. Extremely heart warming. Just wonderful! Mr. Director please make some more magic like this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As always, can't wait for the next season.  What a clifhanger!  Where will they take the story next? I've heard the series referred to as a &#34;soap opera&#34; and wonder what series doesn't resemble a soap opera in some way or another.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|I'm really enjoying these headphones. I'm very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />1) comfort - good for long home/work wear, not meant for activity. ear cup comfort lasts long over time. you'll take them off due to sweat long before taking them off due to pain.<br /><br />2) mids/highs - they strive for higher crisps, but fall decidedly short. definitely not the brightest... however they have very very low &#34;harsh&#34; quality to them. they are almost completely lacking in the distracting tins. so what you end up with is an acceptable warm sound even it if is a little foggy/hollow.<br /><br />3) honesty - 72%<br /><br />4) ear fatigue - one of the lowest ear fatiguing headsets i've ever worn. actually they may be the BEST.<br /><br />5) bass - kinda poor here. the overall sound quality combined with low fatigue make up (to me) what theses lack in bass. who really wants heavy bass in earphones anyways? a-holes, that's who.<br /><br />6) aesthetics/design - nice modern classics. kinda rad in an electric kind of way. i wouldn't be embarrassed to be photographed wearing them. the cable connects to the head set via a plug which means you can easily replace the cable without cracking open the cups. this is awesome if you've ever lost a pair of phones with much life to give simply because a 5¢ cable gave out.<br /><br />7) purpose - they work great in general. that is, no one music genera sounded better than another. they did decently with TV and gaming as well. strong female vocals will be the most noticeable place they reveal their limitations.<br /><br />8) value - for $85 you can't ask for much more. if you are coming off a pair of $40 crap phones from Target, these should sound light years ahead of what you are used to. If you are an audiophile you might want to aim a little higher.

B00B9366VO|5.0|Interesting insights into the technology and personalities involved in a place that most music consumers (this reviewer included!) knew only as a &#34;Recorded at...&#34; credit line on the back of many of the great albums of the 70's and 80's. Dave Grohl's appreciation and respect for what Sound City was, his own important role in its history, and his ability to bring back together many of the amazing musicians that made it such a magical place is the real story of this film.  Highly, highly recommended - especially for young music fans interested in the roots of their favorite artists of today.

B0058Z4NR8|3.0|Why Nations Fail is a grand theory of economic development with hundreds of examples, so many that the book becomes tedious. My recommendation: read the preface, chapters 1 through 4 (which describe the theory) and 15 which is the final conclusion.<br />In short, the theory is simple. The principal explanation of development of a given country is not geography, culture or the quality of its leadership but its institutions. Political and economic institutions can be \\"inclusive\\" or \\"extractive\\". The first kind fosters growth, the others limit it. The first point of the theory is as simple as simplified: inclusive institutions foster growth and there is a certain virtuous circle, whereas extractive institutions limit development and allow for vicious circles. Too simple? Probably, but the insight is still strong.<br />The second part of the theory is very interesting, and centers on the concept of critical junctures. Institutions change slowly through \\"institutional drift\\" and sometimes more abruptly in critical junctures. There, politics matter: the results are never pre-designed, history is contingent and results are open. Summing it up, the book ends thus: \\"history is not destiny. Despite the vicious circle, extractive institutions can be replaced by inclusive ones. A confluence of factors, in particular a critical juncture coupled with a broad coalition of those pushing for reform or other propitious existing institutions, is often necessary for a nation to make strides toward more inclusive institutions. In addition some luck is key, because history always unfolds in a contingent way.\\"<br />Interesting and thought-provoking, the book is perhaps too long, trying to find a middle ground between historical examples and theoretical lines. For non specialists, the aforementioned sections will suffice.<br />More, in Spanish, here: [...]

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am a big fan of the HBO series Game of Thrones and this was the first book I've read in the &#34;source material&#34; A Song of Ice and Fire.  George RR Martin has a gift for revealing a complex and Enthralling story through multiple characters' perspectives.  His prose is an entertaining read, and this books skews much closer to literature than your traditional fantasy genre novel.<br />Note: this was my first experience using the Kindle / whisper sync feature with Audible.com.  For a novel of this magnitude (1,000+ pages) it was a great, seamless way to keep the cocoon of Martin's world even as I commuted to work or found myself with extra time waiting for a meeting to start.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|It takes me a while to relax and unwind and I end up staying wide awake later than I should. This app really speeds up the unwind process! Also, there are many sounds that you can layer and create your favorite mix that works for you or they are good by themselves, they are great quality too. It has a timer you can set so it doesn't suck up your battery if you accidentally fall asleep as well.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I have had this controller for about 3 months now, and have used it extensively. I like the shape of it, as I have always favored the X360 controller to the PS3 controller, and this one is a nice mix of the two (leaning more towards the Xbox one). It's comfortable to hold, is very lightweight (like a PS3 controller), and holds a charge well (and it sports an integral battery with a micro USB connector like a PS3 controller). The wireless works great, and it is even easy enough to use it on your PC (via a Windows Live controller spoof program, of course).<br /><br />The real issue, however, is with the controls itself. As others have stated, the dead zone on the analog sticks is pretty large. Personally, I think it is manageable, particularly if you up your look sensitivity in-game, but I could see it easily being a major handicap in online play. It just is not responsive enough for something like that. I also have had issues with the X button. Unlike all the other buttons (including those on other controllers), you can just tap it quickly and expect it to register. I often find myself hitting it repeatedly because you have to push it all the way down to work. It could just be my specific controller has this defect, but to me it just reeks of shoddy craftsmanship. Again, it is not something I find to be unmanageable, but it does detract from the overall experience.<br /><br />In short, this controller has some nice features and a low price, but also has some major issues with responsiveness. It is not too hard to compensate for this when playing alone, but it just would not be a good controller to use to play against anyone else.

BBC is making it available online for a short time, to those that can watch it on their iPlayer. PBS will also make it available online for a short time on their website when it premieres.<br /><br />This review will not give any spoilers for those who have not been able to view it. I know that this DVD set is going to be out next month (so I do not know what DVD people have been reviewing before, as it is only on pre-order). I am assuming that Season 3 will also be streamed soon on Amazon Prime, like the first two seasons.<br /><br />In short, the wait was worth it. I so enjoy the writing and the evolution of the story line, the characters, and their milieu. I do not want to question, I do not want to think. I want to be so absorbed, so immersed that I can be swept away by the world of Sherlock and John. And when I do, for a moment, stop to think, to contemplate, it is in satisfaction.<br /><br />I was prepared to love it. I was actually prepared to hate it (cynic that I can be). I was not prepared to feel the exact same rush (exhilaration?) that I did before in the first two seasons.<br /><br />There is nothing else like it on TV. And I hope that there never will be, because with writers like Moffat and Gatiss, and actors like Cumberbatch and Freeman, I hope things will only keep getting better and more amazing. You will not be disappointed. There is a certain comfort (for me) in knowing that I am on the same page as Gatiss.<br /><br />When this last episode plays, I may be needing some type of therapy.<br /><br />My desperate wait for the Season 3 premiere below from last year, still available for those that enjoyed my rambling:<br /><br />SHERLOCK AND JOHN WITHDRAWAL<br /><br />Here I was telling all and sundry about my obsession with Sherlock and Watson and that I was so glad that Season 3 was finally near; and lo and behold the release date has changed yet again!

I have now become a low-functioning Sherlockaholic.<br /><br />To alleviate this distressing disorder, I have taken the liberty of re-watching Seasons 1+2. The fact that those two seasons are supremely spectacular has given me the ability to fumble along in this mundane world that can in no way compare to living at 221B Baker St. And it has made this wait somewhat bearable.<br /><br />I fear that if Season 3 is delayed one more time, this withdrawal may become so severe that moving to London may be my only solution.<br /><br />However, for those Sherlockians who are rating Season 3 so poorly, because of the release date, I say (in the words of Sherlock) to \\"'Delete' because only the important stuff matter,\\" (very loosely quoted from Season 1).<br /><br />And on that note, in the eventual Season 3 release, you will get a review from me that is written along the same lines of my Seasons 1+2 reviews.<br /><br />But for now, yes, this has become a Watson-esque blog (which may, depending on the release date, be expounded upon significantly).lo and behold the release date has changed yet again!

B008220C38|5.0|I was very impressed by the artistry of this movie. Keira Knightly nails Anna, her vulnerabilities, her pride, her &#34;sins&#34;. The story is told passionately and pretty completely. But it is done in symbolic fashion, as a play on stage. It shows how the Russian aristocracy of the 19th century lived in a delicate world where the rules apply and reinforce themselves, but not everyone is held up to it equally. Anna breaks too many rules and isn't sorry and so she pays the ultimate price. It is a shame this movie didn't take more Oscars. It was very well done. And different than other versions I have seen of &#34;Anna Karenina.&#34; It could have had more development of the Kitty/Levin story but it was the best presentation of that I have seen. They are the moral heart of the book and I think people really need to read the book to understand their role better.

Chris Eccleston is my favorite Doctor of all time! What a great actor and the chemistry between the Doctor and Rose (Billie Piper) was incredible. I really thought I would like David Tennant's or Matt Smith's Who better but I was wrong. Eccleston just nailed it. Great writing and great stories. The episode called Father's Day really got to me and had me crying my eyes out. For anyone who has suddenly lost a loved one under tragic circumstances, have the tissues ready for that episode.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a magnificent story-teller for the modern age.  He has no equal.  In this book he brings a reality of the lives of Afghans living in Afghanistan over the last 50 years and those who escaped to the diaspora before the country fell into deep divisions of hatred, war and attrition.  The book in some way mirrors the lives of a country I know well, Zimbabwe.  Zimbabweans may not have experienced the extent of the ravages of war for so long, but many of them live in abject poverty today and in fear of those in power.  Millions of Zimbabweans have escaped to Europe, to America and to other western civilisations, yet millions remain.  I have read his other works, but this book surpasses them for its complete understanding of life in and outside Afghanisatn.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun and challenging.  Keeps the brain active.  Would recommend to those who are interested in keeping the mind alert.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Look, I like a challenge, but one that can be met and overcome, not one that is so hard or impossible, you can't enjoy the game! Make it hard enough, not impossible!!!!!
B006O5YIMQ|4.0|Worked through the story line too quickly, but what was told was good. Fight scenes were good, not great, but good.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This is NOT an actual game... From the icon you can't really tell that! I was brand new to Kindle etc. and wasn't familiar with getting the descriptions, ratings, etc. So from the icon you think you are getting a game... who needs an app to describe a game that has descriptions and instructions built in????? DUH!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This works great. I love the building crescendo alarms so I can wake slowly. Plenty of different choices, for alarms, sounds, vibrations. Can't go wrong.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The problem with this game is that my battery dies before my interest in playing.<br />It is fun and highly addictive.
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|A fine collaboration of artists representing decades of musical accomplishments. Seems like only yesterday that Kenney Wayne and Johnny Lang were the new young guitar slingers on the block. Stills career is as varied and fascinating as anybody else's in the music industry. Goldberg flew the Electric Flag, co-wrote \\"I've Got To Use (My Imagination\\") and learned (literally) at the feet of the original Chicago blues masters. There are so many good things on this set and even a few great moments but I do have one complaint and it has nothing to do with the quality of these songs. I purchased the CD release from Amazon then afterward discovered that BEST BUY was selling an exclusive CD/DVD with 3 bonus songs (\\"High Voltage\\", an edit of \\"Honey Bee\\", and an acoustic version of \\"Don't Want Lies\\") . I must say the BEST BUY bonus versions of \\"Don't Want Lies\\" along with the instrumental \\"High Voltage\\" are worth the extra cash on their own. Two years ago Stills contributed a song \\"Low Barefoot Tolerance\\" to the soundtrack release of a documentary entitled \\"Wretches And Jabberers\\" dealing with children afflicted with autism. You can hear when an artist transcends from just entertaining to creating something personal and meaningful. \\"Low Barefoot Tolerance\\" is such a song and this acoustic version of \\"Don't Want Lies\\" is the other side of that same coin. Stills has always been reticent from revealing what goes on in his personal life but here he offers a glimpse,and truth be told this bonus cut should have been included on the regular release. It's Stills at his best and easily stands up with any other songs in his catalogue. Kudos to Goldberg and KWS who along with Stills have created a work of art that they can be proud of. But if you want the best, purchase the BEST BUY release.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|This movie is magic. It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by  Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.<br /><br />The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, Jos&eacute; Garcia, and Elias Koteas  and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by  Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive. How to spend a summer evening! Grady Harp, September 13
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Lovvvvvveeee!!!!! Read in a day!!! Didn't stop til finished it all. Then read the one from his point of view.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I originally got this app for use on road trips.  But now I use it at home.  Love the hourly forecast and the beautiful graphics.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful! Wonderful!  That's about all I can say about this book.  It is so good.  I had never read anything by this author but decided to try it after reading a little about what it's about.  That short description doesn't begin to tell you about all the other characters and their lives.  I was always anxious to get back to the book to see what happened next and how in the world this would end. I can't imagine someone not liking this but I am sure there will be.  Hated to see it end.  I would give this 10 stars if I could.
B00AEV60GS|1.0|Undisclosed Ad-Ware with Fine GPS Permissions. App gives the usual Wi-Fi data. Nothing spectacular. The trouble is that when you get a paid app you don't expect ad-ware. Wrong, just wrong. Fine GPS permissions with the ads makes it even worse.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Like this game. The greatest graphics are very good. Does freeze on occasions.<br /><br />Would recommend it to my friend thank you
B00CFYAT6O|3.0|Musically and recording wise outstanding - Derek Trucks' guitar work has few generational peers in 2013 - and the band is rock solid. The material on this CD is however soporific - Derek was far more adventurous in choosing/creating material before the TTB and the assembled songwriting skills leave much to be desired.  \\"Part of Me\\" has some energy but this is due to directly borrowing the opening guitar lick from the Colonel, Mr. Steve Cropper on Hayes and Porter's \\"Soul Man\\". The TTB has to do better than this.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is the best zoo game ever. Since it has the safari truck, animals, and the family of the animal's. It's fun, awesome, great... words can't ever experienced it. It's worth a million dollars.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The book is an interesting read, however, the author makes a lot of claims without any attempt at substantiation.  It would have been interesting to have been informed (footnotes or the like) about the historical data he claims to be basing most of his opinions on.
0525425772|5.0|Theodore Boone: The Activist - John Grisham<br /><br />© 2013 New York, Dutton Children's Books<br /><br />This is the best Theo Boone yet!<br /><br />There now that the blurb is out of the way, you'll want to run down to the local library or bookstore and obtain a copy of this little YA gem.<br /><br />This time, Theo puts his debate team skills to not only defeat his opponents from the cross-town rival team, but to try to help save his friend's family farm. It seems that all the politicians in the state and the businesses in the county want to push through a by-pass project which will displace a number of families on the outskirts of town at a cost of multiple million dollars while schools are getting shorted in the funding department.<br /><br />Theo learns some valuable lessons about activism and ethics as he works through his case this time.<br /><br />This is some of the better writing involved in the Theodore Boone series (see opening sentence above). It is one of the very best examples of internal struggle available on the current market. The moments where our protagonist wrestles with what is right, wrong, and just are on a par with Frank Stockton's classic short story \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\"<br /><br />I can't hold back my five reading glasses for this excellent example of juvenile suspense.<br /><br />--Benjamin Potter, September 6, 2013
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. Great graphics. I am a pre-senior citizen and<br />have fun playing games that keeps the old noodle on its toes. This one<br />falls into that category, at least for me. Fast paced and those darn little minions are so cute :) And it was free to boot!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I have heard of the &#34;language&#34; of flowers, but never delved into it before. That part of the book was interesting.  I got annoyed at Victoria as the book went along. The ending was expected, but it wrapped up well.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I really enjoy reading the Dexter series.  I'm glad I bought it.  Thanks again.  I liked the book.  Now I have written enough words.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|this was great buy - not only did I get the blue-ray but I got the DVD which the grandkids can watch in the bedroom when they come visit.  Plus the digital download.  Well worth the price.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This is a really good collection of his hits over the years. I have nothing to say about anything bad about it!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I've like Phillip Phillips since I saw him on American Idol.  I liked the fact that his image and sound never changed no matter how much they tried to make it.  His songs are definitely him and I enjoy listening to them.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Fun, easy to play, quick to learn.... and that from a 50-yo white guy with fat thumbs and not much spare time.LOL.
0451418441|1.0|Print was so small  I had to return it. It's a large book, many pages and the thought of trying to read the teensy print had me squinting
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Got it on time, good packaging, brand-new, now this is a good movie I really liked, I watched it a few times, and want to get the next one red two. They don't make a lot of movies like the, it is a good one, and has a storyline.
B005HF1CR8|3.0|I have followed Medium because of the actors...hated to see the end of it and the way it was done
B004FQX59I|5.0|I rather love this movie, it's about history that I live in, and how it affected my life, after Kennedy was killed, LBJ become president and sent us off to war in Vietnam, and Cuba and South America was attacking the United States with nuclear bombs sent from Russia, we went the wrong way to Vietnam and should have went to South America and overflowed the dictators that was in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, all of South America, now we have a whole nation divided, and the dictators are still in South America. This was a great show that opened the points of view on both sides.
B004X80QNG|1.0|This is a very poorly, badly designed edition, very disappointing! WIS has always had a reputation for high quality, highly efficient applications, what a shame.
B000AP04EW|3.0|I would like to seeing the couple work together against an enemy, then beating the each other up. Some people will like the movie, my son told me about it, he like it, or I would've not ordered it.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|The whole story line involving Data's brother B4 has refreshed the SNG series. I love reading about the interaction of the NEW Enterprises senior staff, particularly 1st Officer Worf...Waiting for him to become the first Klingon to command a Federation Starship.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|Other real good movie, got it on time, new in the plastic, I forget how hard other wars are to fight, this brought back the memories of other wars the United States was in. It was a good movie. Matt Damon is a good actor but he don't have common sense about politics. But it's a good show.
B0034IZVV8|4.0|It's a good compilation, but it missing &#34;The Call&#34; which I think was a huge oversight.<br /><br />Worth getting I suppose.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|it was a ok movie did not know the actors but it was ok. the time will come for real fighting and I hope we have some one like them to do it. it had good specalafecs. and full picture. and sound
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Beware the kind of addiction that this series will inflict on you. I was hooked after the first season, but Season Two picks up the pace even more. Now fully conversant with the backgrounds, bloodlines and aspirations of each of the primary families, the second season shows how the hopes and plans of each one to rule the seven kingdoms are progressively dashed and frustrated.<br />All it has done is to make me even more eager to see Season Three!  Bring it on!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you like bingo then you will love this take. It has outstanding graphics and so many cool levels. You can play on facebook and you can invite your friends to play with you. Great download and fast.
B009A9BEHU|1.0|Or rather, the lack of one. Not that that's Amazon's fault though, Live 2012 seems to be mysteriously missing from every music download store I've checked. Every store except iTunes. Must just be a strange coincidence, I'm sure Coldplay wouldn't deny their music to other download stores in a poor attempt at making iTunes seem like the better option... would they? Oh, wait, that's exactly what they've been doing for the past two years. Those past two years have brought us iTunes exclusive songs, delayed releases on streaming services and iTunes exclusive eBooks, so making Live 2012 into essentially yet another iTunes exclusive sounds par for the course.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|You know how some old movies are best remembered.... This one Stands the test of time. The picture now is 100X better than when we saw it on tv or at the movies.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|We listen to a lot of this music in my Jazzercise classes and it's good, fun music.  I also saw the movie with this soundtrack and the music is great.  I enjoy it very much.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I haven't had this app for long, but so far I've found it to be just as good, functional and easy to use as the iPad and iPhone versions, just as functional. My tablet had no problem automatically syncing and detecting a recent purchase, and the download of the new purchase went smoothly.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|Definite buy!!!!!!!!! Seen it when it was released here in the states. Have the DVD but now BLURAY yea!!!!!!. Hopeful to see a digital copy as well?!?!?!
1609419693|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud uncontrollably. Made my ride to work 100% enjoyable when its normally awful. Thanks Tina :)
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I have to say, not having been around for the Original Series of Star Trek, it has been beautifully re-visioned by J.J. Abrams. Once again J.J. and his team deliver on setting the stage for a limitless universe where the cast and crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise forge their way through the galaxy and certainly into history on the big screen.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I love this thing,works great once you get the hang of it..... always a good cut. Makes it very simple.fast shipping too
B0055D3EFU|3.0|one of the scarier movies of these days. everybody knows scary movies arent even scary anymore but this one is the best done in recent times. you still wont be scared out of your mind but it's a good try
147892506X|5.0|My kids love this series and honestly I do too. They love guessing what is going to happen next and begged me for car trips to anywhere just for a chance to listen. Hoping there are more to come.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|I was rather disappointed with this game. It is hard to play and the instructions are not very clear at all. I gave up
B000WC4A8O|5.0|I have the CD since 2008 and I was happy with the songs that were selected for this album (even I would have preferred Fool on the Rain instead of In the Evening), but I'm a vinyl collector so I decided to purchase this box based on many reviews and it worths every penny. Powerful sound, beautiful packaging: sleeves, booklet. I can feel the hammer of the gods in my living room. Just Amazing!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|LOVE this game. I bought this game along with several others and it was a big hit. In fact I had the family involved finding the numbers. Great game
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, I'm at 79% and almost apprehensive... I know where the end is leading and I'm not ready for it to be over! I am completely overwhelmed by Jobs' personality. I had no idea he was such a control freak, but in the same breath, how deeply he truly cared about his inventions and the &#34;end user experience&#34;.<br /><br />Very well written, not at all one sided, and I would recommend this book to anyone; no matter what genre you prefer, this book is so awesome to read the technological advancements that Jobs’ and his closest colleagues and companies have created.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|If you are a fan of Josh Groban, this is the for you.....his voice is beautiful and the music is wonderful.
B00CX7OX6U|1.0|You can call a pile of garbage \\"art,\\" if you wish, but the truth is that it is still garbage. Don't waste your money, and more importantly your time, on this huge pile.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Having fun keeping my mind sharp. I am enjoying the creative puzzles while collecting new objects for new goals. The puzzles keep changing even when I go back to them. Endless entertainment.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|I've been playing this game for 2 weeks with a three year old its awesome I'm still not done finding new stuff everytime we play!
B00003CXCS|5.0|I love this story and my grandson, also loves it. We are so happy to have a great movie that we can watch at our leasure.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|When articulating how passion can do awesome things for you via &#34;personal brand&#34;, Gary-V not only gives his opinion as to what will work and what will not, rather, he says WHAT will work, WHY it will work and HOW to do it!<br /><br />I'm better off having read this here book and will now help Mr. V-Chuck evangelize like a freak!<br /><br />And now, I shall no go and CRUSH something!
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Good remake, with nice references to the book series. Definately for a true Oz fan. I'd like to see more from the series
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun, kind of sad that I play so much... no shame! The realistic horses and needs make it very fun.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was a modern day Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison combined. A mad genius!<br />Well-written biography.  I highly recommend it!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The book 1º, 2º and 3º are excellent, but the 4º book is rubbish.<br />Apart from that, is not a good idea having the 4 books together, because is more difficult moving through the books.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I didn't notice some of the bits in included and was very happy to find them. There is a magnet bit, a conversion bit so these can be used in a standard-sized screw driver. Since it is a little thin I was worried about getting torque on the screwdriver but the extension can be used as a t-bar!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I really got into the story, but was blown away by the action. i would recommend for a family movie.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Leonard Dicaprio was superb! This somewhat modern version has a nice spin that pull you into the dialogue.
B00BF8OYJO|5.0|Oh, come on!  I really cannot find different things to say about all the good things that one should say about Mistress Beaton.  She is so comfortable to be with. W. Walter.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Its seems to be a gimic to get you to play other games.  I only downloaded it because the prompt to use it kelp blinking on my Kindle which gives me a headache.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome... the updates can be a big update but they do patches soo thats good!!  GET IT'! YOULL CATCH ON REALLY FAST!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Got one for myself at Wally World and paid a little more than here plus tax. These are awesome, i have taken cheap knives with NO edge at all and taken them to a pretty nice edge with about 5 minutes of effort. i grind hard on the carbide part, and then follow with the sandstone part to polish the scratches out.  The Rod part is awesome for serrated edges.  i carry it with me every where i go and sharpen my knives when i get bored rather than fidgeting or twiddling my thumbs.  Seriously.  Get one you shouldn't pay more than like 7 or 8 bucks as wal-garbage has them for about 8 bucks sometimes.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|You will understand why it is the best selling in UK in 2012 when you finish the first chapter!  So many reviews have stated the storyline so I would just say it definitely a worth reading for the year!!
B00DU73T08|3.0|Not great.  worth watching.  Boring and slow in some spots.  the girl they cast was not a good fit for the role.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Very interesting, as a French person I learned things I did not know about that period. I highly recommend it
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|My DVR had missed recording this episode, so I appreciated being able to catch it here.  Pretty good show, this.
B0045JEPXU|2.0|I was disappointed in this CD.  I really like his music, but there is only 1 song on here I like.  There's a lot of vulgar language, and the songs are not his best.  I'll keep looking for a good one.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I didn't like this book, couldn't even finish it. Don't waste your time and money. Harry potter as a female, is what I got from this book.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My granddaughter loved the movie. I got this to see if she'd like the story before taking her to see the new Monsters U movie. While not her favorite, she did like it and she also liked Monsters U.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|After hearing all the negative comments about this movie I was hesitant to go to the Theater and watch this film. I enjoyed Kick Ass a lot so I dragged myself to go see Kick Ass 2....And I'm Glad I did! I'm sure everyone has their own reasons for disliking this movie but I thought it was Great. The characters are older and let me just say this..Hit Girl is AWESOME! She's my favorite character and Kick Ass has been working out!! He looks Great, too. I'm not a big Jim Carrey Fan but he did very well in this role. I'm not sure which Kick Ass movie I like better? But, I own the first one and I'm definitely going to own the second one. I can't wait for Kick Ass 3, The Final Installment to see where all this ends? As long as Hit Girl and Kick Ass stay alive it's all good.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is a great movie , As is the Firefly series that it followed . I think anyone who wants a great sci-fi movie , should look no farther .
125000098X|5.0|Just as expected-another breath-taker!  I hope there is another book to continue this family saga.  Read all three in order!
B00821OX98|5.0|Recent years have definitely left American audiences lacking for good sci-fi TV. Falling Skies definitely fills the void. Through the end of season 2, the story and characters continue to develop well and the show continues to give viewers new twists and scenarios to pique the interest again and again. Can't wait to get into season 3.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star rating because I thoroughly enjoyed every page from beginning to end. I have never known read anything in my life about orphan trains. My next book that I plan to read is a biography about a boy who was on a orphan train. I would suggest this book to any one.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I was surprised how taken I was with this movie from the first clip. The amazing detailed movements and expressions of the characters, the amazing actors behind the characters, etc. But was impressive was the service that Amazon provided when we encountered a glitch in downloading the movie. We called the customer service line that appeared on our TV and got immediate service. Turns out it was a simple issue on our end and within a few minutes we were watching the movie! I look forward to a sequel!
B008JFUO4U|1.0|DVD kept freezing up and could never finish the movie. the movie wasn't that bad from what I got to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game for my kindle. Being able to compete against your friends is also a plus if you're into that
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I started this book and couldn't put it down. Read it in 4 hour's!<br />You won't be disappointed with this book!
B0048LPRCS|5.0|One of the best movie I have ever seen, it's in my top five all time. This movie is not for everyone, it's very graphic, dark, a mind bending roller coaster that will leave it's mark.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is by far one of the best games on my kindle and I have a lot of cools it is a must buy really worth the money
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Oh, you'll think you can get by, playing the game carefully and conserving the precious few gems you can get in-game. Maybe you'll figure, hey this game is worth ten bucks, I don't mind paying for some in game currency. But sooner or later you will reach the point where it's asking for fifty dollars so you can buy that third Wonderbolt. Don't do it. Look online for player's guides and you'll find that the fifty dollars for a Wonderbolt is just the prelude to even more money required to buy that silly sun ornament, and no, the game will not let you proceed unless you buy it. Despite being nominally free, this game is actually shamelessly overpriced if you plan on playing through to the end.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got a lot of time in to this game and its worth it haha good download worth your time
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a story!  The horror James endured as a child made me sick inside.  The ending was brilliant!  I hated reading about his childhood. Try the book, you'll be glad you did!!
B00E978FGQ|5.0|I highly recommend this movie if you love good acting, drama, and suspense.<br />I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the end
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed some of the twists I didn't seem coming. Cassandra Clare puts you on the edge of your seat.
B00E1L9N8E|3.0|Movie is okay but the movie does not do credit to DiCaprio,<br />I actually got bored several times, almost went to sleep.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|The book has good advice on pitfalls to avoid when designing a website, I like the commonsense but chatty style  and its short. I would recommend this book to web designers and website creators as well as clients.
B007Y36K46|5.0|The acting and the story line is really good.  Time line of today mixed with<br />a little si-fy is good and well played.
B0014E9188|5.0|This item is worthy of the five stars. Yes its difficult due to the fact that we can always say its dated, and not one member<br />of the band does a solo on any tune. I am not sure they actually<br />have the solo thing down. That being said, they are as artistic<br />as the prog rock bands I have been with for centuries.<br />Starting a beatle in the 60's I grew up a 5 year old spinning<br />45's of love me do. I had exposure to jazz and played the clarinet grew into a modern extreme fusion fan period.<br />I only entertain myself with the worlds most technically gifted<br />talents. Sorry pop. I attended the Yes show as a 10 year old<br />when Bruford was wearing the tshirt with the big B in a circle.<br />It was over from that point on, I expanded out and prog what we<br />characterized as Theater rock at the time, became another element<br />of my life. Genesis ruled and Yes Pink Floyd it evolved into<br />Mahavishnu and Jean Luc Ponty, but before it did, I loved music<br />including pop from the beatles and MJ I went to Elton John<br />then came disco and funk with earth wind and fire Chicago<br />still horning tower of power it all became new wave then punk<br />rock and that was pretty much it, techno not really workin<br />and we had Jamaican reggae rappers since 65, as a child I didn't<br />realize I would witness music go from a to z in my lifetime but<br />it evolved and is now a dead progression.<br />along the way I saw symphony that had started centuries before<br />and that was all we had as the bands shrunk after the wars<br />jazz guys got too stoned and started rocking out after hours.<br />little did we know LOL. I love hank Williams sr. the surfer music was hot tj brass and the hippie sounds leading up to<br />jimi Hendrix where music peaked in my opinion, its been really<br />a lost cause after Hendrix. Sorry again.<br />I only listen to mike stern and return to forever reunion stuff<br />alan holdworth frank gambale john Jorgenson al di meola,<br />G3 for rock. that's pretty much it.<br />SO WHY GIVE SOME KID BAND PLAYING DATED THEATER ROCK<br />A FIVE STAR RATING WHEN THEY CANT EVEN DO STEVE HACKETT<br />QUALITY LEVEL SOLO'S????<br />well the reason is, pure unadulterated love for this genre<br />and the vintage or dated sounds it represents, they do it well<br />very commercial, yet quality. Good vocals, meaningful songs,<br />dynamics and tones that make up for a lack of high speed<br />techniques and soloing. Harmonies that take me back to early<br />yes and genesis, riffs like pink Floyd you know the story.<br />All young people should be fans of PT, out of respect for their<br />parents.
B00755MHXG|4.0|A modern morality tale?  Perhaps so - for, as well as being the deeply moving story of Auggie and his struggles to fit into school life and become the ordinary kid he so wanted to be, 'Wonder' also made me reflect on my efforts as a parent. Auggie's story made me see that there were many times in my days of child rearing that I could have done things better, and I so wanted to go back and do them again.<br />There were many times in this book that you could see things coming so clearly but, in a way, it didn't matter as the story was so beautifully told. Despite being predictable I found it hard to put down.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is way fun and I can't get enough of it! I wish the bonuses were easier to get but that's what makes this game challenging. Overall I love this game.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone Girl was an easy-to-read page turner, but executed with a sophisticated and very skilful literary style. I thought I was a fairly canny reader, but I fell into all the author's traps and false leads. The only reason I did not rate this as a 5-star is my frustration with the protagonist, Nick, and his inability to either know his own mind or take action when it seemed so clear what he needed to do. Perhaps that was all intentional, but I nevertheless wanted to give him a good kick at times!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|It's friggin awesome ! . This Movie rocks, even though it's Old!<br />It gets slow at some point , but overall very entertaining.. The Fight scenes are just un believable Lol!!<br />5 stars! aloha
B008469DGY|5.0|This game has to be one of the best games I've downloaded on my kindle. It has very addicting gameplay with great graphics.  The rules are simple. You just have to flick the golf ball and try to get as close to the hole as possible. If you flick hard the ball will go far. And if you flick softly the ball won't go that far. It just matters on how fast and slow you flick the golf ball. Seems easy but it's very hard to master. I found this game to be weirdly soothing and calming. It just gets me relaxed. If you just want one amazing game this is the game to get. Trust me, you will have a blast.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor worth its weight in salt. Classic comedy. Four pretty male models dousing each other with gasoline like bikini girls spraying each other with hoses to &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; (Wham) and then accidently blowing themselves up by lighting a cigarette? I'm not sure it gets much funnier than that.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|fantastic campy romp in a wizard of oz-like colorful galaxy.one of the best rocking soundtracks in any movie,supplied by queen.great fun.win!
B008469DGY|5.0|Its not really like golf at all, but its a lot of fun.  Fantastic graphics.  My whole family enjoys playing this game.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I've seen the movie twice, even better the second time.. Not recommended for anyone under 18.. Very in tense movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome book, makes you think. Makes you change your way of thinking. Would recommend to anyone who is motivated and open to new ideas.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This one does not need a review. It is my childhood fantasy which I love to read any number of times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an entertaining never-ending running game that I can play for hours and not get bored :) this game be reaaal fun lol
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The first movie didn't do all that much for me (sorry folks, but I thought the first film was a little lame), so I had very low expectations for this reboot and was pleasantly surprised.  It held up nicely and was much more fun to watch than I expected.  I'd definitely watch this a few more times.
B006O6F932|2.0|Very poor quality for the price... Regret this purchase also. I would return it if I could for sure .
B000002B7S|3.0|After the sudden death of guitarist and collaborator Randy Rhoads in Mar. of '82, Ozzy picked up the pieces by recruiting Bernie Torme' to replace the fallen Rhoads, but his tenure was short and proved incompatible. Brad Gillis(later Night Ranger) was selected to finish the existing tour commitments out of which the double live Speak of the Devil album was born. By the next year('83) Osbourne reunited with former Blizzard of Ozz bassist and collaborator Bob Daisley and after several auditions of proper lead guitarist's, Jake E. Lee was selected as  Ozz's new sparring partner in crime. The music on Bark at the Moon reveals a forward step for his solo career and with Don Airey returning as well, the emphasis on keyboards is intermeshed with Lee's talented and dexterous guitar prowess resulting in powerful songs displayed like the title track, Centre of Eternity and the album's closer Waiting for Darkness. Tracks like You're No Different and Slow Down indicate the strength of Airey's keyboards which give a contemporary feel and a sense of commercial accessability, even if the songs are a bit mid-paced, they are solid entries. Rock and Roll Rebel is molded within a classic album track and would prove to be a feature at future gigs and succeeds well alongside the explosive title song and the aforementioned Centre of Eternity. As had been the trend with his prior 2 solo releases in featuring at least one ballad type of number(i.e. Goodbye to Romance and Tonight) So Tired rears its melancholy head and although would be pushed as single from the album, I tend to skip past this generic and underwhelming number. Max Norman returns to give a quality production sheen as had been done to Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman, and Bark features a great sound overall. The writing credits are a bit suspect as crediting Ozzy as sole composer and lyricist to the entire record; over the course of time, however, its been documented that Bob Daisley and Jake E. Lee were certainly instrumental within the crafting of material that wound up on Bark, albeit being paid off behind the scenes because of contractual conflicts and stipulations incurring during the time period.<br /><br />I purchased a used copy from 1995 as the remix campaign of 2002 in Ozzy's back catalogue received some backlash because of not only the remixing of the first 4 albums, but also gave way to re-recording certain parts(primarily bass and drum tracks) which left certain fans feeling suspect as to the preservation of the original recordings themselves. I'm an old school Ozzy/Sabbath fan and I chose the '95 remaster over the '02 remix as I owned copies of the older first pressings many years ago and I don't care for the revisionist tactics brought on by methods within the industry to remake history. If you're in this camp, I highly suggest in seeking out the '95 editions of his back catalogue as they are untampered and truly update these classic recordings. That being said, Bark at the Moon is a competent and solid release with a few minor hiccups evident, but given the time period in losing a key member like Rhoads, a sense of rebuilding his career is one of Bark's admirable traits and Jake E. Lee's style proved to be a much needed ingredient that helps make this record succeed on these terms duly. 3 and a half stars
B008X9Z37A|4.0|It served your it served it's purpose adequately thank you. Will be purchasing an upgrade in the near future thank you
B00785P2QC|1.0|Good game overall. Hard to constantly go back to Facebook to get a few bucks. There needs to be a way to earn $$ to grow the city.
B0089BSOPA|5.0|Hi  AMAZON here I am again .  Firstly BOTH movies HALLOWEEN EXTENDEDEDITION and HALLOWEEN2 COLLECTORS EDITION arrived together!! I always wondered why HALLOWEEN II  seemed to have one if not more various versions I would always wonder what version they would show because I loved the more detailed version!! Anyway thanks to AMAZON I have both very de tailed editions.  I am sooooo happy !  Both movies are a treat for HALLOWEEN  ONLY JOHN CARPENTERS THE ORIGINAL and BEST!!!! Sorry I cant believe they had the NERVE  to remake 1 & 2!!!!!!!! ANYWAY both these films are a must for any HALLOWEEN fan. I am really thrilled to have them in my collection finally!!!!  Thank You  Fondly  IMARIE
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Like most Dr Panda games, this game is visually appealing. Great art style and fun animations. The bug downfall is the lack of direction. Many times, my son just has to keep tapping things to get it to advance. Still a decently made game, but I rate kid's games based on my child's interactions and this didn't keep his attention for long.
B000MDJH9A|4.0|I believe the movie was great, the plot was completely awesome. I wouldn't mind seeing the movie again and again.
B007AL48UK|3.0|This game is technically sound, but by no means innovative. If you love mahjong you will really enjoy this game. I like the game, but with no hook there really isn't much reason to pick this game over any other mahjong on the market.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|I recently wrote a review about my S.H. Figuarts Scouter Vegeta. Now I'm back to write a review on another amazing figure.<br /><br />Sh Figuarts Super Saiyan Goku is by far hands down one of the best if not THE BEST SSJ Goku on the market today.<br /><br />At the current price I would not wait to jump on this figure, I guarantee you wont be disappointed in this epic figure. While the figure is perfect in nearly every way I must stress that the lack of extra hands and faces that we got with scouter Vegeta and Final form Frieza and some of the other figures in the line that I do not currently own as of yet. IT is still an all in all hands down awesome figure. Wither your buying it for your personal collection or a fellow DBZ fan this figure is a must buy. The range of articulation and fluid body poses you can arrange him in this Goku is just the best one around.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|This game is definitely fun at first. Customizing your character is enjoyable enough and you can earn more accessories as you play.... if you make it that long. The downfall of this game is lack of diversity. You either punch as fast as you can or block. And once per match, you spin a circle as fast as you can; which isn't all that fun on a touch screen. All in all, the game seems well made and is mildly entertaining, but is extremely one dimensional.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I never saw the first season of Eureka when it aired on Syfy, but I'm delighted that it appears on Amazon Instant Video. This delightful series has lost none of its charm over the years.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the second book I've read recently that tells a sad story. How a parent can abuse their own child is beyond me - especially this kind of abuse. Love doesn't conquer all but it's certainly welcome in this book!
B000HL2J0G|3.0|My Dad loved this show. By today's standards it's cornball. But it's a fun watch, and I enjoyed watching it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Excellent read! I did not want to put it down. It was well written with unexpected twists! Can't wait until her next one!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Pretty cool. Different objective as you are trying to stop the pigs from stealing your egg. You still launch birds at them although the pigs are moving towards you instead of stationary inside of a building. Overall B+
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. the only thing is there is so little to do for comps. so it feels like it is given that ill place. the other thing is everything is really expensive. but other then that, love the game.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I had this on the original cassett tape, and it broke. I am so glad to be able to listen to them again. This is my FAVORITE group, ever..
B00A7L00XE|5.0|Both my husband and I love this CD.  I saw it being advertised on CBS Sunday morning and had to order it.  Highly recommend it if you like the Blues.
B00701897I|5.0|this is my kind of movie i like cartoons because of the vivid looks it give a good hdtv but this movie is more for adults and less more for childrens but u notice quickly the story the graphics&#34;fantastics&#34;pics a must for the family to watch and laugh together.
B009WUBERW|3.0|This was  typical shoot em up, blow em up movie. The star studded cast made the movie enjoyable. Other than that, it was poorly written.
1600597963|5.0|Being a student of Ms. Eakin by way of her first book, \\"Beading with Cabochons\\"  I waited with baited breath for a whole year for this one to come out!  It was well worth the wait.  As with the first book, this one is easy to follow and understand, with loads of pictures for inspiration.  The lessons are retained and it leaves you with the confidence to create your own designs.  I am very happy with this book.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I bought this CD to complete my Bond movies, one of the best! The Bond movies already have a space for this movie
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This is my all-time favorite television show. The third season introduces Chuck's ultimate villain. If you have never watched this show, you have got to check it out. Great set.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Works great I put the date on the outside to track how long this will last. The light is very bright.  I like the soft light model for my bedroom thought.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|This up and coming group has been astounding. I love to sit and listen to every word and note they emit. Cannot wait for more!
B004SBX112|1.0|This appears to be the free version, it is packed full of annoying ads. I realize it is only .99, but it is sold as 'ad-free'. It is NOT.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I added this app a few days ago. Looks great on the Kindle HD. I love this game. Minions are just too cute.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|For those who like epic adventures within a world with depth this series really delivers. For the record I do not like high fantasy. I identify with characters who are more realistic and flawed. This book is full of characters who are all flawed, some of them intentional heroes, and others unintentional.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game. Play it everyday and like that you don't have to spend any money..wish they had more games like this.
0345529057|5.0|I've bought this several times now.  Hardcover, soft cover, Kindle, Audible, the comics, the Lands of Ice and Fire.  Westeroes and Essos have become my obsession.  Its quite frankly the finest most meticulously constructed fantasy world I've ever found.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This was a very heart warming and intriguing movie.  I really liked how the story unfolded. It kept me interested throughout the entire movie wondering how each letter would be delivered and what the letter would say to do.
B0081336FO|5.0|If you like Robert Downey Jr and Judd Law, you will love Benedict Cumberpatch and Martin Freeman.  The introduction of modern elements into the Sherlock Holmes universe is done masterfully with just the right touch of comic relief.
B005PK56TA|3.0|it started out weird then it went to predictable but something made me keep watching it.  would not reccomend it for children under 13.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I saw reviews about how this breaks on the first time of use... I was skeptical about purchasing it; however I did because I needed it. It works great. I have an S3 Mini. the upper clamp holds it in place tightly.
0385504225|5.0|Love this book
B00845PRDS|4.0|I liked it a lot. Not as much as The Hurt Locker, but it was a good movie worth watching.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I've always loved this movie since I was a kid. I ordered it because I have it on VHS, but I lost it in storage. I have to have this movie, so I ordered the DVD version.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I waited 2 years to be sure I would enjoy the CD before purchasing it. I definitely enjoy it! I can't stop listening to it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game.is awesome cause.it just it so fun an I can't believe it's credits just so kool get  an you will now what I'm talking about
B00BB22GQM|5.0|The latest Vampire Weekend music is as expected, nothing less than a perfect blend of musical talent and well-written verse. Definitely worth many listens!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is pretty hard to get me up in the morning and the option to have it increasingly loud really helps so that I actually have to turn it off instead of sleeping through it. Then the math problems I need to solve to turn it off help make sure that I am awake.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is definitely something to have on your iPod! There is not a bad song on the CD, and this is I'm sure the first of many excellent offerings from Imagine Dragons!
B000F3T3CS|5.0|It's a wonderful love story but filled with great humor.  Loved Anna Netrebko -- she is cute and funny in this opera.  And what can I say about Rolando Villazon -- he too is cute and funny -- and wow!  what a voice.  I've never seen an opera where the audience insisted on an encore during the performance!  Villazon sings so beautifully -- what a talent!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is a tv series that I don't mind if my child sits next to me and we watch together.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|Even if you think you don't or won't like opera, you're wrong!  Verdi's Rigoletto is full of great music and there's a surprise twist at the end of the opera.  Polish tenor Piotr Beczala is the best!  And soprano Diana Damrau is perfect in this role.  Her rendition of Caro Nome is absolutely gorgeous!  I listen to it almost every day!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Me and my sister play this game everyday and love it!! I bet everyone else will as well it's very fast no crashing and kid friendly.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|Three of my favorites -- Netrebko, Beczala and Kwiecien -- all fantastic.  This is a marvelous opera!  Gorgeous music and a story of intrigue!
B00D8OHPF8|3.0|There are some great tracks on this album but it's not as good as some of previous work.  Joe is one of the artist you just buy automatically because you know it's going to be good, but this one I should have sampled in its entirety first.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Somehow I lost the CD of X &  Y some time ago, so I had to pick it up again.  While they have several great albums, I think this is arguably one of the best.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great storytelling.  Really enjoyed this book and look forward to the next in the series.  An engaging, fun bit of fiction
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good series. Did not like that they killed steven actor. He was the best looking guy on the series. They need to bring him back
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A very good and a fun movie to watch. A lot of big name stars in this movie and each one of them contributes greatly. John Malkovich almost steals the movie by adding some crazed humor. It does have some profanity, it is not sexually graphic, and while there is some violence, it isn't very graphic. All in all a great movie for the family, if your kids are over 14.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Allows us to watch Netflix etc on our BR TV using a smartphone as a remote. It works better than the smart tv in our family room and is much faster connecting!
1609611543|5.0|Hating to admit that the contribution of this thing WHEAT has nearly undone our culture,<br />this book has helped me find alternatives and REASONS to move away from plain old yeast bread!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Limitation:<br />Only supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.  This could be a serious limitation if you live in an area with Wi-Fi congestion as it will limit your ability to watch Hi-Def streaming videos.  Unfortunately I live in a apartment building, and I am unable to enjoy my Chromecast experience due to the congested 2.4 GHz band here.  I had to lower the streaming quality to accommodate for this, and it doesn't look that good.  My 5 GHz capable (or wired) devices, however, have no issues streaming the same content in Hi-Def.<br /><br />Setup:<br />Super easy, just plug it in, power it up, and use your computer/tablet/phone to configure using simple to follow instructions.<br /><br />The good:<br />It greatly simplifies watching streaming content experience.  You can use your phone/tablet or a chrome tab to stream the content on to your TV.<br /><br />It is a work in progress:<br />For now, only apps that support Chromecast out of the box are Netflix, Google Play Store (Video and Music), and You Tube.  While other streaming content providers (HBO GO, Showtime etc.) are working on adding support, it might take some time for all your favourite streaming content providers to be on board and release their apps.  Just as an example, HBO GO app still doesn't work on latest version of android even though it was release some time back.<br /><br />Tip: Use the power adapter if your TV supports HDMI 1.4<br />Reason: If your TV supports HDMI 1.4, and you have Chromecast plugged in to a separate power source, the TV with turn on auto-magically and switch to correct channel when you start streaming via Chromecast.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Bought it and now it won't open....horrible product I would like my money back....for anyone reading this DON'T buy this app
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Candy Crush is available for your Kindle. Google the instructions to download or go to You Tube and watch the complete tutorial! Hope this is helpful!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|We hardcore fans already own this album.  I rate the album 5 stars for us.  Trent is absolutely genius, and this album is no exception.<br /><br />Having said that, if I were to recommend The Beatles to someone, I'd say start somewhere around Rubber Soul, and include the White Album and Abby Road. Don't start with the first album boy band Beatles.<br /><br />Same concept for NIN.  If you're more into dance music, well hey start here actually.  Most people trying to get into NIN should go for The Fragile, Downward Spiral, and Broken.  Once those albums change your life and who you are as a person lol, keep exploring.  And once you get to this album, you'll understand that he's the best out there.  Period.<br /><br />What am I talking about?  If you don't own every NIN album, that's your fault and you should just put yourself in timeout......:)
B00340LM8C|4.0|You can't go wrong watching an Alfred Hichcock movie!  So sit back and bring the popcorn and enjoy the show!

B00DGKQF2S|4.0|the cd is not bad at all.the singer sounds like Sammy h. and some songs sound like audio slave and there are a few slower blues/rock songs
B000TO0T4O|5.0|It's suspense is amazing. Alex fights force three and Drevin. And then Alex in space wow I was amazed. These books are awesome.

B003Y5USF0|5.0|We love this movie, it's campy, and wholly unrealistic, but still so much fun!!  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding and the fact that Cary Elwes tries to be southern is even better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed this series. Very entertaining. Looking forward to next season. The actors are very talented, reflecting the dynamics of life.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Be warned! You could get addicted to this. I find myself having to set limits on the number of rounds or time I allow myself to play as I get so addicted to advancing levels. Very fun game.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|I had rented this movie at a RedBox at the university student union I work at and then my mom had bought it for me at Blockbuster a year before it had gone out of business.Diane Lane and John Malkovich were exellent in this movie. It is a Movie that Walt Disney himself would have been proud of. I think that Secretariat was one of the greatest race horses that ever lived and he sure will be missed. \\"SecretariaT\\" is a movie that will be destined to become a Disney Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|it a good game but when I go to my nabors and I come back my farm look a zackly like my nabors and it makes me refrease it ever 5 sec.
6305949980|5.0|What to say.  My daughter has been looking for this movie everywhere.  I bought it from Amazon -- I knew they would have it and it was a surprise for her.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's not an ordinary hidden object game! Didn't know that I would have to do the same hidden object scenes a BILLION times to get a quarter of the coins needed To go onto something else - unless I want to actually purchase more stuff.
B00E8B1358|3.0|I enjoyed the energy of the movie especially the scenes with the ninjas. I missed Marlon Wayans and his comedy relief and the power suits but they made up for it with an interesting story line and straight action.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is better than the TV series.  It is a great read.  It is a great read.  Glad I purchased the series.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I'm just a fan of Bruce Willis. He's good in that he's not the only star of his movies. He allows other actors to shine. The Die Hard series is about big bold illogical far fetched action that I just love to lose myself to.
0871403633|4.0|A bit slow going because of the many details, but a fascinating account of evolution and why not all primates evolved as humans.
B0040I09RM|5.0|amazing... very violent.. not a show for kids under 13.. best show ive ever watched... very well directed... watch it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I continue to enjoy everything in this great show! Everything about it is most appealing to my eyes and ears.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I love this move, it works grait and came in good shape.  this move is good for the kids and adults.  I love watching this move in December.  It gets you in the holiday spirit.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  It portrays a different view of life behind bars and is well written.  Hopefully, there will be more work coming from this author.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|The movie is well done!  Not the flashy science fiction we are used to seeing. Does require that you think a little.  I wasn't sure what to expect but really enjoyed it.
B00AW28HF6|2.0|I received this book from the independent writer's review initiative.<br /><br />The book's content has been somewhat fleshed out in other reviews so I won't delve into too much of that as to not give away any more spoilers but will just give my impressions of the novel.<br /><br />The book is a modern day spy novel in which the characters live in a world where everything is either secret, super-secret, ultra-secret, or specially designed and pre-ordered for a spy and the characters jet all over the globe in order to catch terrorists.  Cool!<br /><br />Some things are done very well and some others were not to my liking and these are sometimes right next to each other which makes the difference all the more evident.  For example the author's description of the events surrounding one agent's escape from Egypt during the Tahir Square uprising was exciting and compelling yet immediately after that the book falls into a section which feels very tired in the way that it merely explains what happens (instead of showing).  Another reviewer had commented that the writing style feels journalistic and this is exactly what I saw.  It sometimes felt like I was reading a newspaper recounting of events.  If the author could have stuck with the former style for the entire book then I think this could have easily been a 5 star rating from me.<br /><br />Perhaps the author's strongest suite lies in the way he can describe locations, specific mannerisms, items, cars and places that would be specific to those locations.  This felt very real and very authentic to me.  I do not know if the author has been to all these different places as there are so many but if not he has done his research well.<br /><br />Perhaps his weakest suite, to me, is in his dialog.  Many conversations throughout the book felt contrived or jumpy, not fully fleshed out or inauthentic.  Maybe I don't know how spys speak but many of the conversations just didn't feel `right' to me.<br /><br />There are small errors, such as spelling or grammatical that could use a good scrubbing (even stuff like a comma in the middle of a word -clearly a mistyping or \\"massage\\" being spelled \\"message\\", etc., etc., etc.).  Also other mix ups are present such as in chapter 12 where the author describe something Sarah and Aden are doing but calls them Aden and Zak which make things very confusing.  Normally I overlook spelling and grammatical errors with independent authors because they are on their own and don't have an army of editors helping them but this book had enough that it was really starting to become a distraction.  It almost felt like it was a first draft.<br /><br />On a final note, this book is not for children as it has some depictions of sexual acts that are a bit graphic (unnecessarily in my opinion) and it is a spy novel so obviously there is some violence also.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After having read some other series which were alleged page turners and have become severely disappointed by the lack of thrill or the horrible writing, I believe I finally found a book series I can not wait to read and can actually enjoy the concise writing style.  I found myself emotionally invested in the characters and cheered them on during their struggles. This post apocalyptic story demonstrated the good and evil of human nature and its persistence throughout its existence regardless of time and place. The author did a excellent job of &#34;showing&#34; the story rather than &#34;telling&#34; it. I could not put down this book and lost quite a few precious hours of sleep (as a new mom) getting myself lost in the world of the Silo but found it enjoyable and exciting.  I cannot wait to read the rest of the series!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not every author has the actual &#34;gift&#34; - to bring their readers into the world of the story and then keep it so real that we feel more than &#34;connected&#34; to the characters.  E.L. James does exactly that...and then some!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A heartwarming, heart wrenching story of the black/white relationships in the South.  All the characters were &#34;real.&#34;  I found it so compelling that I had to &#34;ration&#34;.my reading time and &#34;save it for dessert&#34; till after my chores were done.
0785814531|5.0|I got this for my granddaughter, who became interested in Poe after I quoted &#34;The Raven&#34; to her.  She was very excited to get it.  I think I may have to get another for myself...  :)

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This may be a work of fiction, but the message rings true. Everyone counts, and no one is just a face. Get to know people on the inside. Don't ever judge a person based on appearance or society's version of attractive vs. ugly.
6302561841|5.0|Modern Times is probably one of the most recognized silent films of all time.  Funny thing is, its not really a silent film.  It has many of the major elements of the silent film era, but this movie was released in 1936, several years after talkies were invented.  Sure, its in black and white, the characters don't talk to each other, and Charlie Chaplin reprises his most famous character, \\"The Little Tramp\\", for the third and final time, but there are small sound parts. This was Chaplin's way of poking fun at talking pictures.<br /><br />To the casual observer, this could be just a funny little story about an average guy (Chaplin), whose heart is in the right place, yet he  doesn't seem to catch a break no matter where he goes or how hard he tries, and a young orphan girl (Paulette Goddard) who steals a loaf of bread and the little tramps heart all at the same time.  But there is a dark side to this film, and if it wasn't for Chaplin's genius in physical comedy and satire, the film could have ended up too bleak to really be entertaining.<br /><br />The movie is about two people who are trying make it in a world where all the odds seemed to be stacked against them.  The music, written by Chaplin is very poignant.  Here we hear the song, \\"Smile\\".  As it is playing, you begin to hear the lyrics in your head.  (\\"Smile though your heart is aching; Smile even though its breaking;) In spite of all the grey shaded areas, \\"Modern Times\\" is a story of hope; hope that can beat down despair. It is a genuine classic that deserves its position in film history.
B00E8B1358|4.0|It was a pretty good movie, very exciting and the quality was nice on my t.v. but I always have to rent HD movies even though my t.v is LCD because anything lower sucks basically.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|Built upon improbability, and framed within a romantic triangle, a story is told of practicality (Scottish fisheries expert) vs hope (Sheik Muhammad). I enjoyed this movie very much!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Acting was superb (with that cast, of course). Special effects amazing / scarey/ sobering. Touching relationship portrayals. 3 more words.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is a good quality recording (Standard Def). When connected to large screen TV using HDMI, the SD quality rendered approaches HD, a whole lot better, anyway, than the junk SD quality that the Comcast SD box delivers when the show airs on TV. No need to spend the extra $ for the HD, IMHO, unless you are a purist. And, it's commercial free! I never quite realized that the actual length of an episode is only 20 minutes. (So, in an hour of aired Big Bang episodes on regular channels, commercials steal 20 minutes of your life!)<br />The show needs no introduction, I suppose. But if you happen to be new to it or haven't heard of it, here are a few words: The characters are surprisingly universal in their appeal and eschews cultural stereotypes, opting instead to root them in personality-based stereotypes, such as, nerd, street-smart, genius, misfit, pretty-and-uninformed, smart-but-weird, etc. It is filled with interesting factoids, successfully gets away with what might have been considered inappropriate comments (racial/religious/social innuendos) with a unique delivery system that takes the sting away, has some genuinely funny situations and a great many great lines. Jim Parsons's (Sheldon) acting is superb and Simon Helberg (Wolowitz) does such a good job that he is a real turn-off, he is so creepy! Clearly, the writers of the show are the real geniuses. Once one warms up to the characters, it's quite remarkable how almost every episode and every season has maintained both the pace and the humor. So if you haven't tried the show yet, give it a shot. It is clean humor with an intellectual backdrop as a foil.<br />Oh, by the way, the sixth season rocks!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Arrg.  There is no better pirate than Long John Silver.  This classic adventure is exciting, interesting, and will bring out the hidden pirate in any reader.  An oldie still a goodie.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Let me start off by saying the graphics are of a better quality on my kindle. Colors are brighter and its focused on the image not extraneous pinner's names comments and stuff. However it isn't as good as the computer. It's great on the go but I prefer my computer. It doesn't  repin well from the kindle browser, and you can't change boards when trying to share an image. It will just quit. Also, picking the image from others is difficult under the share option.<br />Overall it is good on the go but easier to handle on a computer.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini's writing is always elegant and moving, and this book takes several generations and their connections and conflicts and weaves them together in a masterful novel that will stay in your mind and haunt you for a long time.  I highly recommend this book.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Beyond the story ... check out the locations and the 'locals' that were used for background.  Clearly this movie could not be redone as it stands since those locations simply do not exist as they did when this was shot.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Good Graphics, Story line is OK, Action is a Little Hard to Believe, But adds some depth to the Characters. Over all I would say a Good Movie.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Couldn't stop watching. I don't normally watch musicals but this isn't a musical...it's music within the story. Great characters and story lines. Love that there are no commercials.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|It is as is advertised becasue it runs off the website which I like because it gives me on the tablet what I would see when I log into my gmail account for a computer.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I clicked on the movie by mistake. Thought it was the old Stallone movie.<br /><br />Boy was I in for a treat.<br /><br />Why 5 stars? Many movies ask you suspend \\"real world\\" beliefs, this one actually doesn't do that, in the future<br />resources are getting very scarce and criminals are running rampant, justice must be dealt swiftly and although<br />the system is not perfect, it's better than having criminals running uncontrolled.<br /><br />The combination of superb directing, fantastic acting, and believable special effects makes this movie one of the best for 2012. Hands down.<br />Go watch it, you won't regret it.
B00BX8U0EE|5.0|Finally everyone can hear this great release without spending your whole pay....and also get to hear related out-takes and live cuts too.<br /><br />One of Hawkwind's best,although my fave is still Hall Of The Mountain Grill.Check out that tile too.

B0026Q8F6C|5.0|When I watched this movie in theater for the first time, it was an instant classic. It is vulgar/crude and out there, so in short, everything you could possibly ask for in the south park movie. It is one of the few movies that I continue to watch over and over again over a decade later.

B00A2H9OZS|4.0|If you're a diehard Vin Diesel fan, then you probably remember him even for his lesser known roles in films that include Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room, and Knockaround Guys.  But, the rest of us have come to know Diesel in basically two roles and two roles only:  Dominic Toretto in The Fast and the Furious franchise and Richard B. Riddick in the Riddick franchise.  Depending on how you feel about these two particular franchises - odds are that's how you judge whether you like or dislike his acting choices, which have largely included the role of the thug or tough guy.  Regardless, The Fast and the Furious franchise quickly lost its flavor without Diesel involved, eventually leading him to disappointing and lackluster roles in films, such as The Pacifier and Man Apart.  Eventually, Diesel reclaimed his role in the Fast franchise over the course of three more sequels - not to mention his fame.  And, much like Sylvester Stallone with Rocky and Rambo, Diesel hasn't forgotten the character that put him on the map.  It's been nearly 10 years since Diesel played the role of Riddick, but after a lengthy wait - the saga of the shiny-eyed convict finally continues in the second sequel (unless you count Dark Fury, then it would be the third sequel), simply titled - Riddick.<br /><br />David Twohy (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick) is back to direct Riddick, starring Vin Diesel as Richard B. Riddick - a convict, last seen in The Chronicles of Riddick, had just conquered the Necromonger Empire.  However, it was only a matter of time before Riddick was betrayed by his underling, Vaako (Karl Urban).  Riddick attempts to return home, but is instead marooned on a desolate planet by the Necromongers - and must once again ward off not one, but two groups of mercenaries looking to collect the bounty on his head.  At the same time, a storm is approaching that will once again allow a massive race of predators to unleash maximum carnage.  Jordi Moll&agrave;, Matt Nable, Dave Bautista, and Katee Sackhoff also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Personally, nothing pleases me more than when a franchise has the same director for all of its films.  As a devoted fan of these flicks, I believe it's of the utmost importance to establish and maintain a rock-solid continuity. It appeases the fans that have stuck with the franchise and makes the entirety of the story flow in ways that most franchises just don't care enough to sustain.  More often than not, it's brutally (but not always) obvious when a film is shot by one director, and then said director hands off the reigns to someone else.  A recent example would be Jon Favreau leaving his directing duties on Iron Man 1 & 2, giving way to Shane Black in Iron Man 3 - who obviously has a completely different style of directing than Favreau.  In any event, director David Twohy is back in the director's chair for Riddick - his third stint (out of a possible three) in the Riddick saga.  His imagination and fingerprints are all over this franchise, from the development stages to the plot direction - all of which have contributed to this pure, high-octane series of action sci-fi films.<br /><br />It seems relatively easy to say any given role is the best for an actor.  Since I already used the Iron Man reference, a perfect example would be me saying Iron Man 3 is Robert Downy Jr.'s best performance to date.  Some people might agree with that assessment, but it's the same character being portrayed by the same person over the course of several films, so why does it really matter?  That's the rule of thumb I'm applying to Vin Diesel in the Riddick films.  Without a shadow of a doubt, Riddick is Vin Diesel's best work.  In this case, that's not a very large stretch to say since Diesel has only had a handful of characters in his tenure as an actor.  Riddick could be comparable to Dominic Toretto, but Riddick is much more a savage character - active, deadly, and a character that says what he means and means what he says.  I suppose that's a completely backwards way of saying he's a total badass.  If you've seen the first two flicks, then Riddick is more of the same - meaning immensely enjoyable in terms of overall entertainment quality.<br /><br />While Diesel thrives in his role, there are still some bothersome issues about this film.  First and foremost, Riddick reflects Pitch Black too much for its own good - visually and plot-wise.  Don't get me wrong, Pitch Black was a quality flick with a pleasing plot and plenty of action, but there's still a moderate amount of disappointment surrounding the fact that after waiting nearly 10 years for more Riddick, the film is a rough rearrangement of the first film.  Speaking of disappointment - it's also a major disappointment that Karl Urban only shows up for a matter of seconds.  You heard it - he has nothing more than a brief cameo.  There's an endless amount of potential lost with writing a script that didn't include Urban, especially since he's established himself as a top name in Hollywood.  Since his role in The Chronicles of Riddick, he has ballooned into a near household name - but I suppose a brief appearance is better than no appearance at all.  Hopefully, Riddick will accumulate worldwide success and before long, Riddick will be knocking on Vaako's door in a not-so-distant sequel.<br /><br />Overall, Riddick is chock-full of memorable moments that will have Riddick fans screaming to the rafters with joy (present company included).  Recent news reports have cited the difficulties Diesel endured financially to make this sequel, so he should be commended for making a film for his fans - especially since there are plenty of actors out there that would have passed on such a gamble.  In my opinion, Riddick pays off with dividends in terms of action, CGI visuals, acting, characters, and complete quality of the end product. Even more impressive is the fact this movie was filmed on a reduced budget of $38 million, compared to its predecessor, which cost more than $100 million.  Obviously, this film warrants a view, but there are strings attached - and this is where Riddick might hit a snag in the \\"success\\" department.  The major drawback is that it's been 13 years since Pitch Black was released, and 9 years since its sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick, was released.  Naturally, that means if you haven't seen these two films, you'll need to watch them before watching Riddick - as there are heavy details from both films that tie into Riddick.  But, if you're caught up on these flicks already, you're good to go.<br /><br />GRADE:  B<br />FNDNreview.comays.  I suppose that's a completely backwards way of saying he's a total badass.

Anita puts it in easy to understand terms with no attempt to sell/convince you.It is a magnificent true story that is well written.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Very much worth the view!  I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn a little about Lady Margaret Thatcher.  Streep is still the best at her craft!
B008JFUO4U|3.0|May try to watch it again, but have seen so many better ones, and was kinda disappointed, with the really good stars that were in it
B00E978FGQ|3.0|This movie seemed interesting to me but for whatever reason I skipped it in theaters. After a friend recommended it to me, I thought I would give it a rental.<br /><br />This movie was straight up fun! I think it tries to over reach itself which isn't always a bad thing, sometimes movies need to push themselves even if they don't pull it off. This is no The Prestige (which funny enough has a lot of the same actors). One problem is the level of expectation that the advertising set for the movie, it didn't really do a great job of saying what the movie is about. Throughout the movie I was surprised by the amount of screen time certain characters got over the Four Horsemen. This movie is really much more of a Mystery/Thriller as seen from the cops trying to figure out how these things were done.<br /><br />I really had a lot of fun watching this movie and there were parts where I was completely taken by surprise which I really enjoyed. If you like watching detective shows, have a love for Illusions and Magic then this is a movie you would like.<br /><br />This is on the Green Embers' Recommended List!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I was skeptical, but you'll not find a movie like this anywhere.  Dale and Tucker are funny and endearing in their own way and it's a gory story with a heart.  I love seeing bad actors get hacked up, shot, and impaled.  You will too.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|But it does start branching away from the books in Season 2. Not in a bad way, but it's definitely a little different. Characters/Actors are still amazing. Story is still amazing. Everything is still amazing!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved the book, loved the story within it, loved the  dilemmas of life made more extreme by the experience of a diffenent aproach.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a fantastic writer. While this world he created is a bit hard to stomach at times, it's still pretty awesome.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was an easy page turner if you are able to get past a few things and use your imagination.  Has a good mystery component that makes the reader curious as to the ending.  Almost like watching a summer blockbuster type of movie where you can't be too concerned with every little detail.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Stays fairly true to the books, great castings, best intro! I love the books the best still, but this is pretty awesome. They did an amazing job at casting for the roles! Tyrion is the best!

B00BPA6XUK|5.0|One of my all time favorite soundtracks ever! It's a great road trip soundtrack, or when stuck in terrible traffic.
0440237688|5.0|To highly enjoy this book you must learn the symbols of they objects in this story such as the meaning of colors, the Adam & Eve story, the meaning of the apple (which you should learn about by reading Of Adam & Eve). Once you know what all these things when this story will make complete sense and also have you enjoy it highly! I'm 15 and had this book as a classroom project after the first 3 chapters I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! It's that good! I highly recommend it to anyone of any age who wants a heart wrenching beautiful story. This story is non-bias due to the fact that nothing separates anyone from anything except for the jobs in this book. Which makes you think, like I said I highly recommend it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was swept away by the characters and story.  So much imagination in his fantasy.  Another great read from Gaiman.

B000UZNRS2|5.0|fast paced with many interesting twists and turns. didnt want to put it down. very interesting character development. Baldacci is an excellent writer
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I wanted a camera I could use to 'scan' my sketchbooks AND use to broadcast video of my working in them. Perfect. Amazing resolution and it is passable video at 1920x1280 and great at 1280x720. Not 30FPS, but usable for demonstration purposes. If you really need smooth motion, just reduce the resolution to 640x480 and it's full 30fps.<br /><br />Perfectly posable and the manual/auto exposure and focus are perfect for the kind of work i'm doing. Be sure to order an extension usb cable, it'll make you're setup a lot easier.<br /><br />I wasn't too crazy about using the included software, but it works great and is a pleasure to interact with, doing a number of things that I didn't expect like image flipping for when the cam is posed in a less than ideal position. The software also controls the camera for other apps. For instance, if you want to record in Quicktime, you can adjust your exposure and resolution in the Ipevo software and Quicktime just records the feed based on those settings. It's great!<br /><br />The one thing I would love: The ability to plug in two cameras and control them simultaneously.

B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like the ability to select the youtube video from within the app and the ease of downloading.<br />The ability to select the video resolution is a real plus as well, since I watch the downloaded videos on systems with different playback abilities.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really only chose to read this after it was announced that Charlie Hunnam was set to play Christian Grey...the book is intense, sometimes a little much. The ending is weird...it's no a well written book but that's obviously not why it's so popular ;) I know there are 2 more books...and I have no idea how the story continues but the ending of this book is extremely anti climatic, very disappointed and quick.
0345803485|1.0|I have never been compelled to write a review on any product-ever, not one that I have purchased anywhere. After learning that Charlie Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy is playing the lead role in the movie, I downloaded an audio version of Book One.<br />The poor quality of the writing and character development, notwithstanding, I was curious what the uproar was with \\"fans\\" who think this super hot, talented actor is a bad choice for the lead.  Really? The better question is why with this piece of Holy (literary) Crap was ever published.<br /><br />I read through Book 1, Part 1 with great pain, returned the book. It's the worst book I've ever come across and while reading it must be awful, listening to a woman narrate the \\"Christian\\" lines would be funny if it wasn't such a slap in the face to any and all writers/narrators.  Terrible Book!  It deserves -5 stars.

B009OYSFDM|4.0|I enjoy this show, don't get me wrong, but I'm not sure if I love it yet.  The acting seems, sometimes, a bit subpar.  I enjoy the concept, and it's great to see a reboot of the green arrow.  Also, love seeing deathstroke.

B00B0U2SFE|5.0|All these descriptions fit Oskar Schindler, who saved 1100 Polish Jews from the Auschwitz ovens during the second World War.<br /><br />Before we get into a critique of the 20th Anniversary DVD of the 1993 movie, let's deal a bit in fact and fiction.<br /><br />Fiction: In his overly-sentimental, romantic way, director Steven Spielberg fudges some facts of the way the list developed and deals in some fantasies about the man Schindler himself.<br /><br />Fact: If you want a realistic account of the man Oskar Schindler and his wife Emile Schindler (whose role in all of this got short shrift from Spielberg in the movie) you should read the book: &#34;Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account.....................&#34; by David Crowe. Crowe deals with the real Schindler and the real source of the list, plus Mrs. Schindler's outstanding role in affairs, both during and after the war.<br /><br />And now to a critique of the 20th Anniversary DVD movie.<br /><br />In the movie, Spielberg creates a legend of the saviour, Oskar Schindler, because he deserves it. (Schindler is portrayed by Liam Neeson.) The movie is shot in black and white without the brilliance of colour so that our sense of the stark, heart-rending facts are not diverted by our sense of colour. Only one scene shows any colour whatsoever, at the time the Krakow ghetto was being violently cleared out. A beautiful little girl is trotting along  the side of the people being cruelly evacuated. Her coat is coloured red. This is a symbol of the blood shed on all of the innocents. The girl herself, although appearing as an innocent child just trotting along unknowingly, proves not to be that unknowing. She goes into a vacated apartment building, ascending to the top apartment, and hides under a bed. The innocence of the girl, then the knowledge of her destination, makes this a chilling scene.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler was born in Brinnlitz,, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic) just south of the Polish border. When the war broke out (September 1, 1939) and the Germans overran Poland, he made his way to Krakow, Poland, and opened a business which produced pots and pans and cutlery, his market being the German forces.  In order to achieve his market,he goes through a lot of bribery with black market goods for the German higher-ups, a lot of procurement of willing women for them, a lot of orgies, a lot of bottles of excellent wines, and the procurement of other rare goods only available through the black market.<br /><br />After the Germans send residents of the Krakow ghetto to be gassed systematically in the death camp, Auschwitz, those still fit to work are sent to a concentration camp set up at Plawitz. The overseer is the sadistic Armon Goeth, who has a villa built on a hill above the camp and just for fun, sits up there on his balcony, randomly shooting unsuspecting Jewish interns walking around the camp. Following the war, Goeth was hung for war crimes. But while he was commandant, his greatest enjoyment - other than attending Oskar's orgiastic drunken parties -  was random shooting of Jew, and/or beating up his Jewish maid.<br /><br />When the Germans were losing, with the Russians advancing from the East and the Allies advancing from the West, the concentration camp was closed down and all workers sent to Auschwitz. These were meant to include the Schindler Jews, who lived in the camp and worked at the Schindler factory during the day.<br /><br />Schindler and his erstwhile Jewish accountant, Isaac Stern, make up a list of all the workers in his factory, and include Goeth's maid. With a lot of bribing, Schindler gets his Jewish work force sent to him. However, through a cruel twist of fate, the women, in a separate train from the men, are sent to Auschwitz. Just as the Marines save the community at the last moment, Schindler, through more bribing (this time with diamonds) gets the women out of there and sent back to his factory. But because of the retreat of the Germans, Schindler's business is to be liquidated.<br /><br />So he returns to his home town of Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia, and opens a plant there, producing munitions for the Germans. He is aware that the war is nearly over and tells Isaac Stern that if the plant ever produces ammunition, he will be sadly disappointed. At this point, Mrs. Schindler reappears in his life (she had left because he wouldn't give up his womanizing), a clinic is opened for the ill, and she does outstanding work in it (which is only alluded to in the movie).<br /><br />You'll want to see what happens to Schindler and the workers once the war ends and the Jews reward him in their everlasting gratitude.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler is saviour and hero to the 1100 survivors and, in 1993, their 6,000 descendants. This DVD includes interviews with some of those survivors, which is a feature which should not be missed.<br /><br />The very end of the movie switches to full colour. Scene: Israel; Oskar Schindler's grave; a parade to put a stone on his grave (an honour) by some of the 1100 whose lives were alluded to in the movie. Emile Schindler is there.  The widow of  Isaac Stern is there, accompanied by Ben Kingsley, who brilliantly portrays Isaac Stern in the movie. At the end of this scene, a tall, bearded shadow of a man places two roses on Schindler's grave. It is Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />If this scene does not bring tears to your eyes nothing ever will.<br /><br />I gave this movie five stars since the movie in itself is brilliant, one of the greats of all time. Through the story of the Krakow ghetto and the Schindler Jews (as they called themselves) Steven Spielberg presents a brilliant microcosm of the macrocosm of Jewish suffering at the hands of the Germans during the second World War. The elimination of six million Jews was the result of technology gone stark raving mad, the evil vision of one madmen which infected a whole nation.<br /><br />And Schindler, a deeply flawed human being, was still and always will be, a saviour.ler's business is to be liquidated.<br /><br />So he returns to his home town of Brinnlitz, Czechoslovakia, and opens a plant there, producing munitions for the Germans.

B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I loved this movie,I laugh so much Meryl and Tommy did a great job they were perfect for the role they played.<br />I have been married for 46 years and I can relate to some of the situations but if you love that other person and have communication you can deal with the problems together.
B008469DGY|4.0|Lots of fun and easy to understand for someone who doesn't play a lot of games.  I'll be playing this every time I have a few minutes to spare (and maybe a little more).
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I have owned Asphalt 7 since it came out and it was great but, asphalt 8 is even better! Improved graphics, and more vehicles to drive! Only thing I have a problem with is that the game will restart to the menu. But I have only had this happen 3 times while I was playing.
B00C2FFJFM|3.0|Never bought any of her CD's in the past, but I really liked a couple of the songs on this CD and Amazon had it on sale, so I can't complain. A couple songs I don't care for, but over all it's OK.
